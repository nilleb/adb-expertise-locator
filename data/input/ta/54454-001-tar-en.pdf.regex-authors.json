INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) is a corporate priority TA that will \nsupport the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to (i) \nenhance collaboration and knowledge sharing on domestic resource mobilization (DRM) and \ninternational tax cooperation (ITC), in partnership with other development partners; and (ii) \nstrengthen the establishment and implementation of differentiated, country-specific goals on DRM \nand ITC.1 This will be achieved through the establishment of an effective and inclusive regional \nhub on DRM and ITC, where all DMCs and development partners collaborate closely to promote \nDRM and ITC in Asia and the Pacific.2 The TA project\u2019s key outputs are to (i) establish a regional \nhub secretariat function in ADB; (ii) promote strategic dialogues and information sharing among \nDMCs, development partners, and ADB including by organizing high-level regional conferences; \n(iii) develop a web portal for the regional hub; and (iv) drive digital solutions on DRM and ITC. \nThe secretariat\u2014initially to operate virtually\u2014will maximize internal resources in coordination with \nrelevant departments through promoting a One ADB approach, to strengthen ADB\u2019s engagement \nand  support  for  improving  DRM  and  ITC  across  ADB.  The  TA  builds  on  the  initial \naccomplishments  of  the  TA  for  Enhancing  Tax  Transparency  of  ADB  Developing  Member \nCountries.3 \n \n2.  The TA supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational plans for operational priority (OP) 2 on \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  OP  4  on  making  cities  more  livable,  OP  6  on \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity, and OP 7 on fostering regional cooperation \nand integration.4 The TA was endorsed during the corporate priority framework meeting in \nNovember 2020 and is included in the 2021 ADB Management-approved results-based work plan \nof the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC). It is also aligned with \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy 5  in  supporting  efficient,  accountable,  and  transparent  public \nadministration as part of its broader work on good governance and capacity building.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 recognizes the importance of revenue mobilization through OP 6 on \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity (footnote 4), and the Anticorruption Policy on \nEnhancing the Role of the Asian Development Bank in Relation to Tax Integrity.7 Given ADB\u2019s \nlong-standing experience and partnership with DMCs and development partners across Asia and \nthe Pacific8 and strong convening power, ADB will further enhance its efforts on DRM and ITC as \n \n1  DRM encompasses a wide range of activities largely comprising tax policy and tax administration to enhance tax \nrevenue collection, while ITC covers cross-country coordination and cooperation agreements and practices involving \nmultiple countries to enhance revenue mobilization. \n2  ADB. 2020.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a multidimensional health and economic \ncrisis. With only a decade left to achieve the SDGs, the pandemic threatens to reverse years of \nprogress.10 Before the pandemic, the financing gap11 for developing countries worldwide to \nachieve the SDGs was estimated at $2.5 trillion\u2013$3.0 trillion annually.12 The Economic and Social \nSurvey of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific found \nthat developing countries in Asia and the Pacific would need $1.5 trillion annually to end extreme \npoverty  and  ambitiously  move  toward  universal  health  coverage,  quality  education,  and \ninfrastructure while staying on track to limit climate change.13 However this amount will likely \nincrease because of the impact of COVID-19. While the role of external finance is crucial in filling \nthe  fiscal  gaps  of  DMCs,  strengthening  DRM  is  key.  DMC  tax  yields  have  not  increased \nconcomitantly  with  the  strong  and  steady  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  over  the  last \ndecades.14 Even prior to the pandemic, many DMCs did not achieve a tax yield of 15% of gross \ndomestic  product\u2014now  widely  regarded  as  the  minimum  level  required  for  sustainable \ndevelopment\u2014because of a narrow tax base and low tax administration capacity in general.15 For \ncountries to finance their SDGs, and to promote medium-term fiscal sustainability, greater effort \nin increasing tax revenues will be required. This TA will be specifically aligned to SDG 17 \n(Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable \ndevelopment) (footnote 9). \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s DMCs can only achieve the SDGs if they develop and implement an ambitious \nprogram to mobilize substantial additional financial resources. Many governments will have to \ncarefully consider their next steps in economic and public policy reform, in particular, on how to \ntransition their government budgets from pandemic relief to recovery and, eventually, to providing \ntheir  citizens  with  more  equitable,  sustainable,  and  reliable  access  to  essential  services. \nIncreased mobilization of domestic resources would not only reduce the need to issue domestic \ndebt but also address possible overreliance on external debt, which may undermine the use of \nfiscal and monetary policy to support domestic economies. In developing the program to mobilize \nsubstantial additional revenue, the following reforms will be critical: (i) broadening the domestic \ntax base, (ii) enhancing tax compliance, and (iii) developing more transparent and efficient tax \nadministration with digital technologies. It will also require ensuring that tax policy promotes \ninvestment,  and  that  private  sector  development  leads  to  more  inclusive  and  sustainable \neconomic growth, including the SDGs.

Lessons from previous TA projects point to strengthening \ncapacity in revenue administrations.16 This will take on added importance in light of emerging \nchallenges, including significant and rapid changes in the business environment (i.e., expansion \nof cross-border supply chains and the digital economy) and the scaling up of capacity-building \ninitiatives. \n \n6.  To broaden the tax base and mitigate income inequality, DMCs should consider expanding \nthe tax  net  in  a manner that  encourages trust  among  its citizens,  while  adopting  a more \nprogressive tax system may be a possible solution for addressing income inequality. This also \nmeans that governments should take decisive steps to address harmful tax practices, such as (i) \naggressive tax planning of some multinational enterprises that exploit gaps in the interaction of \ndifferent tax systems to artificially reduce taxable income derived from DMCs, a process known \nas base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS); and (ii) tax evasion, which happens through the \nexploitation of the interconnected global financial network and use of tax havens.17 Joining the \nInclusive  Framework  on  BEPS  and  the  Global  Forum  on  Transparency  and  Exchange  of \nInformation for Tax Purposes18 is a key step towards protecting national revenue against BEPS \nand  strengthening  DRM  through  the  implementation  of  international  standards  on  global \ntransparency and exchange of information for tax purposes.19 In addition, DMCs should engage \nwith the international community to address tax challenges arising from the digital transformation \nof the global economy, which are increasing as a result of the impact of COVID-19. Indeed, the \nloss of potential revenues because of a lack of a global agreement on the tax challenges arising \nfrom the digitalization of the economy are estimated at $50 billion\u2013$80 billion per year.20 Given \nthe narrower tax base, the loss of revenue from a no-agreement scenario is proportionately \ngreater for developing and emerging economies. \n \n7.  Subsequent economic and public policy reforms should be informed both by international \nstandards on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes, as well as by country-\nlevel development and fiscal needs, revenue administration, and tax and governance structures. \nThe country-specific, medium-term revenue strategy (MTRS)21 is a mechanism for countries to \ndetermine a comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy for increasing tax revenues over the \nmedium  term.  Complemented  by  a  communication  plan,  an  MTRS  can  help  DMCs  attain \nsustainable and effective tax system reforms. MTRSs will require high-level political support over \nan extended period, with the revenue goals being aligned with political economy considerations. \nMTRSs can also serve as foundations for development coordination. To this end, DMCs, in \ncollaboration with development partners, need to maximize regional and international resources \nof knowledge, expertise, and finance on DRM and ITC. A significant gap in DRM and ITC in Asia \nand the Pacific is the lack of a pan-regional tax community.22 Although there are important tax \ncommunities in Asia and the Pacific, such as the Study Group on Asian Tax Administration and \nResearch and the Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association, they do not provide a platform \n \n16 ADB. 2020.

The regional hub will promote the SDGs and the Group of \nTwenty  (G20)  and/or  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD) \ninitiatives, such as the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax \nPurposes and the Inclusive Framework on BEPS (footnotes 17 and 18). The hub will also assist \neach DMC to define differentiated DRM and ITC goals, including (i) an MTRS, in coordination with \nthe Platform for Collaboration on Tax;24 and (ii) a road map for digitalization of tax administrations, \nwhich facilitates the introduction of digital tools. \n \n8.  Development partner coordination. ADB works closely with development partners in \nstrengthening taxation across Asia and the Pacific and, over time, development partners have \neach developed a specific expertise.25 The OECD leads the dialogue among the G20 and \nindustrialized nations on (i) international standards to combat BEPS, (ii) global tax transparency \nand exchange of information for tax purposes, and (iii) the implications of the digital economy for \ninternational  taxation.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  advises  and  supports  countries  in \nachieving  overall  macroeconomic,  financial,  and  fiscal  stability,  and  provides  support  to \nstrengthen fiscal and debt management with a focus on tax policy reforms. Like ADB, the World \nBank provides capacity development and financial support for tax policy and administration \nreforms, with a focus on the adoption of international good practice. ADB is also collaborating with \nthe tax communities that serve tax administrations in Asia and the Pacific mentioned in para. 7. \nA stock take of the planned activities will be conducted more effectively under the regional hub. \n \n9.  ADB experience and value addition. Given the long-standing experience, partnership, \nand convening power with DMCs across Asia and the Pacific, ADB is in a unique position to \npromote DRM and ITC and lead the regional hub through close collaboration with the finance and \ntax authorities of its DMCs and development partners. Within ADB, the Governance Thematic \nGroup (SDTC-GOV) under the SDCC leads the work for promoting DRM, while the Office of \nAnticorruption and Integrity (OAI) leads the promotion of ITC. ADB\u2019s operations departments also \nprovide  important  contributions  to  strengthening  DRM  across  policy-based  lending,  project \nlending, and TA projects.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: DRM and ITC for supporting SDGs and \nsustaining economic recovery from COVID-19 improved (footnote 4). The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: collaboration and knowledge sharing on DRM and ITC enhanced.26 To confirm \n \n23 The Study Group on Asian Tax Administration and Research and the Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association \ncovers 17 economies, and 16 countries in the region make up the membership of the Pacific Islands Tax \nAdministrators Association. \n24 Platform for Collaboration on Tax. \n25 \u201cDevelopment partner\u201d refers to any organization or association that ADB collaborates with under the regional hub, \nincluding those mentioned in para. 8. The collaboration under the regional hub may extend to other development \npartners. \n26 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "5 \nprogress against the TA project\u2019s expected outcome, the regional hub secretariat will conduct \nfollow-up surveys among participating DMC officials and regularly submit progress reports. These \ndata sources will validate whether (i) at least 15 DMCs confirm participation in the regional hub \nactivities on collaboration and knowledge sharing on DRM and ITC, and (ii) at least seven DMCs \nare implementing differentiated DRM and ITC goals appropriate for their specific circumstances \nand level of development. The goals encompass any forms of strategy or targets on DRM and \nITC, such as an MTRS and a plan for digitalization of tax administrations. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Regional hub on domestic resource mobilization and international tax \ncooperation established and institutionalized. The TA will complete the establishment of a \ndedicated and fully functional regional hub27 covering all the DMCs by expanding the initial work \nundertaken under the TA for Enhancing Tax Transparency of ADB Developing Member Countries \n(footnote 3) to create the secretariat.28 The secretariat\u2019s functions include (i) managing high-level \nregional conferences that will bring together policy makers and practitioners from both tax policy \nand tax administration agencies to have a strategic dialogue on critical reforms in the areas of \nDRM and ITC, (ii) organizing capacity-building activities to enhance the institutional capacity of \nDMCs, and (iii) creating synergies for supporting DRM and ITC through active coordination among \ndevelopment partners and DMCs. The secretariat will also develop awareness of the value and \nimportance of the regional hub to stakeholders. To this end, it will (i) create and coordinate an \nADB communication strategy to support country initiatives to disseminate the importance of \nstrengthening DRM and ITC and (ii) produce a generic communication strategy for DMCs to adopt \nand adapt to their specific needs. The secretariat will also maximize internal resources in \ncoordination with relevant departments through promoting a One ADB approach, to strengthen \nADB\u2019s engagement and support for improving DRM and ITC across ADB. It will share internal \nand external knowledge and expertise that will help ADB operationalize DRM and ITC work that \nencompasses  development  of  the  country-specific  MTRSs,  including  through  a  regional \nworkshop.29 In coordination with SDTC-GOV, OAI and regional departments, the secretariat will \nprovide DMCs with technical advice on DRM and ITC concerns. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Strategic  conferences  and  dialogues  among  developing  member \ncountries, development partners, and Asian Development Bank facilitated. In addition to the \nsecretariat managing the high-level regional conferences, the TA will also finance DMCs to \nparticipate in the initial three high-level regional conferences on DRM and ITC in Asia and the \nPacific, as described in output 1. The TA will also support strategic dialogues and policy-setting \nactivities to ensure the highest impact on DRM and ITC with DMCs and development partners. \n \n13.  Output 3: Web portal on the regional hub developed. The TA will develop a web portal \nfor the regional hub that will serve as a digital platform to facilitate knowledge sharing and capacity \nbuilding on DRM and ITC. All information and learning resources developed under the regional \nhub will be shared through the portal, which will be developed within the ADB website and \nmanaged by the regional hub secretariat. The following main components are proposed for the \nstructure of the web portal in the initial stage: (i) overview of the regional hub on DRM and ITC\u2019s \nmain features; (ii) regional hub on DRM and ITC\u2019s background information; (iii) information on the \n \n27 It is envisaged that the activities of the regional hub will be financed by donors in the future. Until then, the TA will \nfinance the regional hub. \n28 The secretariat consisted of one national consultant under the TA for Enhancing Tax Transparency of ADB \nDeveloping Member Countries. Under this TA, the secretariat will consist of one international consultant and one \nnational consultant. The number of consultants may be increased in the future. \n29 Some of the events will be organized virtually under this TA due to travel restrictions in light of COVID-19 pandemic.    \n ", "6 \nregional hub-related ADB activities, event announcements, invitations and registrations, and \ncalendar  of  events;  and  (iv)  compilation  of  all  ADB  tax-related  reports,  articles,  statistical \ninformation, and materials. The portal will include a database for international good practices in \nspecific areas of DRM and ITC. \n \n14.  Output 4: Digital solutions on domestic resource mobilization and international tax \ncooperation promoted. The TA will drive digital solutions on DRM and ITC by facilitating the \ndigital transformation of tax administrations in selected DMCs. Toward this end, the TA will (i) \nconduct needs assessments of the digital transformation in DMCs and develop recommendations, \nwhich will support DMCs to develop and adopt a road map for digital transformation; and (ii) \norganize regional capacity-building and knowledge workshops that improve knowledge and \nunderstanding of digital transformation of tax administration (footnote 29). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,500,000, of which (i) $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1,500,000 from TASF-7 and $500,000 from \nTASF-other sources), and (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund will \nsupport (i) concept development of potential ADB projects by enhancing readiness and capacity \nbuilding, policy advice and dialogue, and prefeasibility studies; (ii) preparation of ADB projects \nthrough feasibility studies; (iii) policy reform and institutional capacity building; (iv) studies, \nresearch,  and  analytical  work;  (v)  dissemination,  networking,  and  cross-learning;  and  (vi) \ninnovative approaches promoting high-level technologies and information and communications \ntechnologies. It will not be used for civil works, procuring large-scale equipment, permanent \nstaffing costs, or hiring staff consultants unless otherwise agreed between the Government of the \nRepublic of Korea and ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. OAI and SDTC-GOV will jointly select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants; organize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in the workshops. \nThe TA will be coordinated with existing TA projects on DRM and ITC and Domestic Resource \nMobilization Trust Fund initiatives to maximize the potential benefits that DMCs can gain with \nrespect to DRM and ITC. It will be implemented in collaboration with regional and other relevant \ndepartments including Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department on a research \nwork. In particular, the selected DMCs mentioned in output 4 will be identified in close coordination \nwith the regional departments by considering country partnership strategies or other relevant \ndocuments or bilateral consultations that endorse the needs and interest of the DMCs. Once the \nregional hub is operational, the regional hub secretariat will take over the implementation of the \nTA in close coordination with OAI and SDTC-GOV. \n \n17.  Arrangement on participation in the regional hub. Given the open and inclusive nature \nof the regional hub, all ADB DMCs are encouraged to participate in it. A formal agreement is, \ntherefore, not required for DMCs to participate in the regional hub. Relevant development partners \nare invited to participate in the regional hub and related activities, including the use of the web \nportal mentioned in output 3. Initially, the participation of DMCs is on a voluntary basis and to be \nconfirmed  by  a  follow-up  survey  for  DMCs.  The  TA  does  not  require  logistical support  or \nundertakings from the participating DMC governments. Arrangements may be amended in the \nmedium to long term, given the discussions among DMCs, development partners, and ADB. \n ", "7 \n \n18.
