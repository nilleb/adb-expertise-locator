THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed direct \nloan of up to CNY164 million ($24.0 million) without government guarantee to Datang Sino-\nJapan (Chifeng) Renewable Power Company (the joint venture) to finance the Inner Mongolia \nWind Power Project in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC). If approved, the Project will be the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) first \nnonsovereign  loan  for  a  wind  power  project  in  the  PRC,  and  will  constitute  ADB\u2019s  22nd \nnonsovereign financing in the PRC. The design and monitoring framework and the development \neffectiveness framework are presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Wind Power in the People's Republic of China \n1.  Problems and Opportunities  \n2.  Energy use in the PRC is rapidly increasing to support the economic growth needed to \nraise the living standards of the country's large population. The PRC has been the second-\nlargest energy consumer after the United States since 1996, and high economic growth coupled \nwith continued industrialization and urbanization has accelerated growth in energy demand. \nCoal is the dominant available resource for power generation in the country and will continue to \nbe so for the foreseeable future. The PRC accounts for significant share of global greenhouse \ngas emissions, even though a per capita emission is low among the countries with the highest \ngreenhouse gas emission. Forecasts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \npredicted that the PRC's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would rise by about 2.5%\u20135% each \nyear between 2004 and 2010. Rapid increases in energy demand coupled with supply concerns \nhave raised fuel prices, leading to deep concerns about energy security. The current energy \npath relies on increased use of fossil fuels and is neither environmentally nor economically \nsustainable.  \n \n3.  Use of abundant undeveloped indigenous forms of clean energy, such as wind power, \nhas  significant  potential  to  mitigate  global  climate  change,  address  regional  and  local \nenvironmental concerns, reduce poverty, and increase energy security. The PRC\u2019s vast land \narea and long coastline carry enormous wind power potential. The technical potential for wind \npower in the PRC is estimated to be about 1,000 gigawatts (GW), over 1.5 times the PRC\u2019s \ncurrent electricity generation capacity. The richest wind resources are in the north and the \nsoutheastern coastal areas, with an estimated capacity of 250 GW, and offshore along the east \ncoast, with an estimated capacity of 750 GW. With an estimated capacity of 150 GW, Inner \nMongolia has the largest share of wind resources in the country. \n \n4.  Development  of  the  wind  sector  in  the  PRC  began  only  recently  relative  to  other \ncountries. By the end of 2007, cumulative installed wind capacity was 6 GW. State-owned \ncompanies dominate the market with the country\u2019s five big power generators (Long Yuan, Hua \nNeng, Datang, Hua Dian, and China Power Investment) operating the largest blocks of wind \npower generation facilities. At present, state utilities continue to win concession tenders, and \nforeign private sector investors own few assets in the PRC. For wind power projects to achieve \ntheir market potential, the market needs to open further and facilitate higher degrees of private \nsector participation so as to bring fresh capital and expertise into the sector.  \n ", "2   \n \n5.  Wind power remains by far the smallest segment of the energy portfolio. In addition to \ngeneric barriers, such as the lack of a mechanism to internalize the environment benefits of \nwind power, various finance-related risks and barriers are hindering faster growth. Most wind \npower  projects  have  high  up-front  capital  costs  relative  to  carbon-emitting  conventional \ntechnologies, and also have low rates of return. Many financial institutions therefore are not \nready or willing to provide finance in these new areas, or will do so only under very unfavorable \nterms  for  the  project  sponsor.  This  is  particularly  the  case  in  the  PRC,  where  access  to \naffordable finance is difficult and relies on political support. In addition, wind power projects \noften require local currency financing. In addition to policy frameworks, financial instruments are \nnecessary to give financiers sufficient assurance and incentive to shift investment away from \nconventional technologies to more investment in wind power systems. \n6.  For the wind sector specifically, the Government has established targets of 10 GW for \n2010 and 30 GW for 2020, to reach about 3% of total capacity by this time. With an estimated \nCNY190 billion ($27.9 billion) required to fund the goal by 2020, and state generators still \nadvancing  on  the  learning  curve  for  assessing,  building,  and  operating  viable  wind  power \nprojects, further private sector participation is necessary for the sustainable development of the \nwind power sector. Many private sector companies are poised to take advantage of the PRC\u2019s \nvast wind power potential, and private investment is playing a growing part in wind power \ngeneration utilizing different business models.  \n \n2.  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region \n7.  Rapid urbanization, industrial development, and income growth have all come late to the \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region after several decades of lagging behind the PRC\u2019s other \nprovinces. Inner Mongolia has a population of about 24 million, with only 48.6% living in urban \nareas. As one of the 12 western provinces, its economy is less developed than most eastern \nprovinces. The average income for urban residents is CNY12,378, which is less than half that of \nthe average of Shanghai urban residents (CNY23,623); the average level for rural residents is \nCNY3,953 in Inner Mongolia, compared with CNY10,222 in Shanghai. Of Inner Mongolia's 101 \ncounties, 31 are national poverty counties and 29 are provincial poverty counties.  \n \n8.  The focus of wind power development in Inner Mongolia has been on providing rural \nareas far from power grids with access to electricity. Some 70,000 herding households in Inner \nMongolia still remain without access to electricity, and small-scale turbines are seen as an \neffective solution. Much of Inner Mongolia\u2019s installed wind units were small, off-grid systems\u2014\nan important source of distributed power to many of the province\u2019s 11.3 million rural residents.  \n   \n9.  With abundant wind resources, developing a commercial wind sector is now an element \nof industrial, energy, and environmental policy. The province\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan emphasizes \nmedium-to-large-scale wind facilities. Inner Mongolia has long-term plans to become a major \nsource of power for other provinces. The province was among the leading areas in high-voltage \ngrid investment during the 10th Five-Year Plan period, and much of this development was for \nhigh-voltage export lines to other provinces. Already, Inner Mongolia exports more power than \nany other province, sending 39 terawatt-hour (TWh) in 2005 across three transfer routes: to the \nLiaoning provincial grid, to Liaoning\u2019s parent Northeast China Grid, and to the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013\nTangshan grid of the North China system. Future plans see Inner Mongolia becoming an even \nlarger exporter via the northern corridor of the west\u2013east transmission scheme. These plans will \nsee western Inner Mongolian eventually serving eastern China markets directly.  \n \n ", "  3 \n \n3.  Policies and Regulations \n10.  Over  the  past  decade,  the  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  has \nimplemented a series of renewable energy policies trying to achieve a wide range of goals such \nas rural development, industry development, environmental protection, and energy security.  \n \n11.  The  five  goals  for  the  PRC\u2019s  renewable  energy  policy  are  to  improve  the  energy \nstructure, diversify energy supplies, safeguard energy security, protect the environment, and \nrealize the sustainable development of the economy and society. To further encourage the \ndevelopment and commercialization of renewable energy in the PRC\u2019s energy system, the \nGovernment with international support implemented a national-level renewable energy law as a \nnew  policy  framework  for  mainstreaming  renewable  energy  in  the  energy  strategy.  The \nRenewable Energy Law was passed in February 2005 by the National People\u2019s Congress and \nwent into affect on 1 January 2006. The law achieves a major breakthrough for the development \nof renewable energy in the PRC by introducing a preferential tariff mechanism. The Government \nwill impose higher electricity tariffs on all renewable energy to guarantee certain profits for green \nelectricity generators. The grid companies are obliged to buy all their electricity from qualified \nrenewable energy sources at the agreed tariff (Article 13, 14), and pass on a certain portion of \nthe additional costs associated with renewable energy purchases to be distributed among their \ncustomers (Article 20). The level of tariff will be determined by the price authorities of the \nGovernment. The Renewable Energy Law is an umbrella document that (i) gives different \nauthorities the mandates necessary to establish volume targets so as to develop the renewable \nenergy market, and (ii) encourages domestic and foreign investments to reach the targets set. \nThe law is accompanied by a number of supporting regulations that extend the policy principles \ninto  specific  measures  that  address  such  issues  as  price  guidance,  grid  connection,  and \nrenewable energy funds.   \n \n12.  The approval process for wind power generation projects is managed at the state level \nfor projects with capacity of 50MW and above, and at the provincial level for projects below 50 \nMW.  Large-scale  projects  are  administered  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (NDRC) through a concession bidding process. The NDRC approved 11 large-\nscale projects under the four rounds of concessions held between 2003 and 2006, most of \nwhich  were  awarded  to  subsidiaries  of  the  five  big  power  generators.  This  is  because \nconcession tenders for large-scale projects up until then were primarily awarded to the lowest \nbidder. The five big state-owned power companies can afford to operate the concessions at low \nprofit margins because they can subsidize these wind power projects with other generating \nassets in their large portfolio that yield higher returns. They are also strongly motivated to win \nconcessions  to  meet  quota  requirements.  The  resulting  low  tariffs  threaten  the  long-term \nsustainable development of the wind power sector, as it has discouraged private and foreign \ninvestors from investing in large-scale projects.  \n \n13.  For  small-scale  projects,  project  siting  and  issuing  of  permits  is  initiated  by  the \nGovernment or by developers. Private investors have been more successful participating in \nsmall-scale projects and also find them more attractive due to the faster approval process, \nbetter tariff prospects, and smaller investment involved. Small-scale projects are negotiated \ndirectly with the relevant local authority, which determines the price for wind power. Pricing data \ncollected from 23 nonconcession projects which the NDRC verified and approved in early 2007 \nshows that some progress towards a sustainable wind pricing policy is being made.  \n \n14.  While most national concession tenders have been won by the large state-owned power \ngenerators or their wholly-owned subsidiaries, some state utilities such as Datang are also \n ", "4   \n \npartnering  with  local  and  foreign  private  sector  developers  for  small-scale  projects  at  the \nprovincial level. State utilities benefit from the additional capital and operational expertise private \nsector companies bring, while private investors benefit from the local relationships already \nestablished by the state utilities.  \n \nB.  ADB Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n15.  The  Government\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  for  the  period  2006\u20132010  aims  to  build  a \nharmonious and moderately prosperous (xiao kang) society, and differs from the previous five-\nyear  plan  by  taking  a  broader  view  of  growth  that  is  more  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  the  PRC1 is  based  on  four \ndevelopment  thrusts:  (i)  inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  in  part  by  focusing \noperations on poorer provinces such as in the central, western, and northeastern parts of the \ncountry; (ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability; (iii) regional cooperation and \npublic goods; and (iv) promoting an environment conducive to private sector development. \n \n16.  The PRC has been steadily transforming into a market economy, which has become the \nbasis and driving force for economic growth and job creation. In addition to policy advice to the \nGovernment  on  private  sector  development,  ADB  also  provides  project-based  financial \nassistance. ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial \nstructuring  to  encourage  private  sector  participation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and \nimprove corporate governance.  \n \n2.  Long-Term Strategic Framework \n17.  ADB's Long-Term Strategic Framework2 emphasizes a higher proportion of support in \nADB's  lending  portfolio  for  environmentally  sustainable  development  and  private  sector \ndevelopment. The strategy seeks to meet the region's growing energy demand by helping \ndeveloping member countries move their economies onto low-carbon growth paths. Specifically, \nADB will address improving energy efficiency and expanding the use of clean energy sources.  \nThe strategy also aims to promote a larger role for the private sector in financing infrastructure \nby supporting public-private partnerships. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n18.  ADB\u2019s overall energy sector strategy is built upon three key pillars: (i) meeting the rapidly \nincreasing energy demand in the Asia and Pacific region in a sustainable way, (ii) providing \nmodern energy access to all, and (iii) addressing sector reforms and governance. Since 2000, \nmore attention has been paid to environment and climate change issues. In the most recent \nCPS  for  the  PRC,  the  target  areas  of  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  road  map  specifically  include \nrenewable energy. In its public sector operations, ADB is involved in a number of efforts to help \nimprove the use of renewable and clean energy in the PRC. \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008.

ADB\u2019s Energy Efficiency Initiative aims to expand ADB operations in energy efficiency \nand clean energy to at least $1 billion a year. The initiative taskforce identified the PRC as a \npriority developing member country in the Asia and Pacific region with the highest potential for \nenergy efficiency and clean energy investments.    \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n20.  The Inner Mongolia Wind Power Project is located in Danian Zi township, Songshan \nDistrict, Chifeng City in Inner Mongolia. The Project involves the construction and operation of \n49.5 MW of wind power generation facilities which will generate an average of 133 GWh of \nelectricity annually.  \n \nB.  Project Sponsors \n1.  China Datang Corporation \n \n21.  China Datang Corporation, one of the five large-scale power generation enterprises in \nthe PRC, was established in December 2002 as part of the division of generation assets of the \nformer  State  Power  Corporation  of  China.  It  is  a  solely  state-owned  corporation  directly \nmanaged by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and is the experimental state-\nauthorized investment and state shareholding enterprise ratified by the State Council.  \n \n22.  Datang is involved in all aspects of power generation, with almost 65 GW of installed \ncapacity, operating 97 power plants across 19 municipalities, and generating close to 305,000 \nGWh in 2007 using thermal, hydropower, and renewable resources. In wind power, Datang \ncurrently owns and manages 1,030 MW of installed capacity and has an additional 1,000 MW \nunder development.  \n \n2.  Kyushu Electric Power Company \n \n23.  Kyushu Electric Power Company (Kyuden) is the fourth-largest of the 10 Japanese \nintegrated  electric  power  companies.  The  company  generates,  transmits,  and  distributes \nelectricity to the Kyushu region, which covers about 11% of Japan's territory, 10.5% of the \npopulation, and 8.7% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) (comparable to the national \nGDP of Australia). In FY2007, Kyuden supplied 88.08 billion kWh of electricity for power and \nlighting to 8.42 million users.  The company operates 194 generation facilities with a total \ncapacity of 19.42 GW. Kyuden is constructing a 50.4 MW wind power generation facility which \nwill be operational in October 2008. Kyuden\u2019s investment in the Project will be made via its \nwholly owned subsidiary, Kyuden International Corporation. \n \n3.  Sumitomo Corporation  \n \n24.  Sumitomo Corporation (Sumitomo) is Japan\u2019s third-largest general trading company. It \nwas established in 1919 and has a global network that includes 100,000 business partners and \ncustomers  and  180  offices  and  subsidiaries.  Sumitomo\u2019s  Infrastructure  Business  Unit  is \npromoting the broadening of Sumitomo\u2019s earnings base in the fields of electric power, power \nplant engineering, eco and energy-saving businesses, and social and industrial infrastructure, \n ", "6   \n \nespecially in Asia. The company aims to establish a retail power supply capacity of 500 MW \ndomestically and increase its retained power generation capacity to 6,300 MW outside of Japan \nby 2010 by concentrating on independent water and power producer projects, particularly in \nAsia. At the same time, Sumitomo plans to expand the supply of renewable energy, especially \nwind power and biomass projects, as well as promote greenhouse gas reduction projects in \ndeveloping  countries.  In  wind  power  generation,  Sumitomo  currently  has  two  sites  under \nmanagement, both in Japan, totaling 32 MW. \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environmental Aspect \n25.  Comprehensive  environmental  impact  studies  were  completed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  safeguard  policies  for  environmental  category  B  projects.  The  perceptible \nenvironmental impacts are noise and visual impacts, but both are considered to be insignificant \nat most, given the considerable setback of turbines from the nearest settlements and the \nlandscape values of the site. The impact from the operating turbines is unlikely to be significant \nsince the turbines are set 5 km from the nearest village. The landscapes that are to be affected \nvisually from turbine placement do not appear to have any unique features. The environmental \ndisturbance normally associated with construction activities (i.e., land disturbance, vegetation \nclearance, erosion and sedimentation, construction noise and traffic, and waste generation) is \nconsidered  temporary  due  to  the  limited  extent  and  significance  of  consequences. \nImplementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan,  which  includes  monitoring \narrangements during project operations, will largely mitigate these impacts.  \n \n2.  Social Aspect \n26.   The Project site is hilly barren land in a remote area, it is not being used for grazing, and \nno herders live around it. No resettlement or social hardships are anticipated as a result of the \nProject. The potential social impacts on the local communities are considered minimal. There \nare no indigenous people or ethnic minorities in the Project site or along transmission lines. No \nlands or natural resources used for cultural and social activities are involved in the construction \nof  the  Project  and  other  supporting  facilities. Thus,  under  the  IP  policy,  no  action  will  be \nrequired. The Project is considered to be category C in terms of both involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous people. \n \nD.  Development Impacts \n1.  Impact, Outcome, and Output \n27.  The Project will promote sustainable growth and environmental improvement in the PRC \nthrough contributions towards achieving minimum-share targets for renewable energy in the \ngeneration mix, and for wind power generation in particular. The impact of catalyzing private \nsector investment in the PRC\u2019s renewable energy sector will mitigate significant greenhouse gas \nemissions and improve the energy security of the country by developing indigenous energy \nsources.  The  Project  features  a strong  model  for  private  sector  participation  in renewable \nenergy through a successful collaboration between one of the five established big local power \ncompanies and foreign strategic investors with expertise in wind power, and thus encourages \nthe private sector to invest in wind power projects beyond the Project\u2019s interventions.  \n \n ", "  7 \n \n2.  Development Effectiveness \n28.  The Project has been assessed and described from the perspectives of development \neffectiveness and project framework in terms of private sector development, business success, \nand economic sustainability as per the good practice standards for evaluation of private sector \ninvestment  operations,  which  were  prepared  by  the  evaluation  cooperation  group  of  the \nmultilateral development banks.  \n \n29.  Beyond enhancing the Project\u2019s financial and economic sustainability, the Project will \nsupport private sector development by strengthening a new business model of collaboration \nbetween a state-owned enterprise and foreign private sector investors. Further private sector \nparticipation will increase the competition, operational efficiency, and corporate governance in \nthe wind power generation sector. Being the first private sector wind farm funded by ADB \nprivate sector operations in the county, the Project will have a demonstration effect for future \nprivate sector investments in wind generation using this model. In its modest way, the Project \nwill also contribute to the implementation process of the newly introduced Renewable Energy \nLaw, and mandatory off-take and preferential tariff revision in particular.  Moreover, the longer \ntenor and local currency offered by the ADB loan, which is not available to foreign investors in \nthe local market, will improve private sector financial institutions\u2019 confidence in the wind power \nsector to provide such financial assistance to similar projects going forward. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Loan \n30.  ADB will provide a local currency loan of up to CNY164 million from its ordinary capital \nresources to the joint venture without a government guarantee. The loan will carry an interest \nrate, as well as commitment and front-end fees, to be approved by ADB\u2019s pricing and credit \nenhancement committee. \n \n31.  The  loan  agreement  will  include  (i)  appropriate  representations  and  warranties;  (ii) \ncovenants, including affirmative, negative, financial, and information covenants; and (iii) events \nof default. \n \nB.  Justification \n32.  The proposed loan merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The Project will support the Government\u2019s policy to protect the environment and \nincrease energy security by increasing the proportion of electricity generated with \nindigenous renewable energy and by diversifying the energy mix. The Project is \nin line with the Government\u2019s strategy of encouraging private sector participation \nin  renewable  energy  infrastructure,  given  the  substantial  level  of  investment \nrequired.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  economic  development  of  Inner \nMongolia,  which  is  also  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region \nDevelopment  Strategy  and  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  to  enhance  economic \ndevelopment and reduce poverty in the central and western PRC.   \n \n(ii)  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s CPS for the PRC (footnote 2), which is based on \nfour PRC development objectives: (i) promoting equitable and inclusive growth, \n(ii)  making  markets  work  better,  (iii)  improving  the  environment,  and  (iv) \n ", "8   \n \npromoting  regional  cooperation.  The  CPS  specifically  includes  clean  energy \ndevelopment and inclusive growth. The Project will help to raise the standards of \nthe population in Inner Mongolia, arrest environmental degradation, and advance \nsustainable inclusive development.  \n \n(iii)  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC, which \nfocus  on  the  infrastructure  and  energy  sectors,  the  financial  sector,  and \nenvironmental  improvements.  In  the  infrastructure  and  energy  sectors,  ADB \nprioritizes  playing  a  pioneering  role,  enhancing  management  expertise,  and \nimproving  corporate  governance.  This  Project  will  provide  highly  skilled \nemployment and know-how transfer opportunity to the joint venture. \n \n(iv)  The Project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy that recommends a \nreorientation  of  energy  sector  activities  to  address  regional  and  global \nenvironmental  impacts.  By  introducing  clean  technologies,  the  Project  will \naddress regional and global environmental problems by reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions.  \n \n(v)  The presence of ADB will reassure the sponsors that the local government will \ncontinue to support this Project throughout its life. ADB\u2019s participation in the \nProject  is  expected  to  establish  more  confidence  in  future  private  sector \nparticipation and financing in wind power projects in the PRC.  \n \n(vi)  The proposed loan, which will provide long-term yuan financing, will offer the best \npossible solution to the joint venture under current market circumstances. The \njoint venture values such financing by ADB since such a product is not available \nto foreign companies in the current PRC markets. As all of the joint venture\u2019s \nrevenues are in yuan, local currency financing helps avoid a currency mismatch \nbetween revenue and expenditure. The long-term loan will increase stability of \nthe Project\u2019s operation. This will also help to make wind energy generation in the \nPRC more sustainable, thereby encouraging more investments by private sector \ncompanies. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n33.  The proposed loans, which comprise ADB\u2019s 22nd nonsovereign financing in the PRC, \nwill increase ADB\u2019s total nonsovereign exposure in the PRC from 20.35% to 20.82% of ADB\u2019s \naggregate nonsovereign operations portfolio. The proposed loan is within ADB\u2019s aggregate \ncountry, industry, single, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Anticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n34.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  Combating  Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003) were explained to the joint venture. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the joint venture to maintain and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The financing documentation between ADB and the joint venture will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n ", "  9 \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n35.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nthe joint venture. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will \nenter into suitable documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval \nof the proposed financing by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \nCNY164,000,000, without government guarantee, to Datang Sino-Japan (Chifeng) Renewable \nPower Company Limited for the Inner Mongolia Wind Power Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, and on such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in this report and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n                      Haruhiko Kuroda \n  President \n \n11 August 2008 \n ", "10  Appendix 1   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING AND DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS FRAMEWORKS \n \nTable A1.1: Design and Monitoring Framework \n \nData Sources \nPerformance \nand/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets and/or \nReporting  and Risks \nIndicators \nMechanisms \n       \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nSustainable growth  Renewable energy  National  \u2022 Continued \nof PRC\u2019s economy  comprises 16% of total  macroeconomic data  macroeconomic and \nby diversifying the  power generation by 2020    political stability \nenergy mix through       \nthe addition of  Government target for  Power sector  \u2022 Continued support for \nrenewable energy  wind is 10 GW by 2010  statistics, as reported  wind power sector \ncapacity  and 30 GW by 2020  by local and national  reforms \n     regulators   \nProtection of the  Reduction in greenhouse   \nenvironment  gas emissions through   \n  replacement of electricity \nproduced by conventional \ncoal-fired plants \n \n       \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nIncreased installed  Increased private sector  Statistics and  \u2022 The Project is \ncapacity of  participation in wind  information disclosed  completed in a timely \nrenewable energy   power projects by 10% in  by the regulator and  manner \n  Inner Mongolia by 2013  state government   \nIncreased private    agencies  \u2022 Offtaker\u2018s compliance  \nsector finance in  Increased commercial    with their purchase and \nPRC\u2019s renewable  banks\u2019 finance in wind  Joint venture reports  payment commitments \nenergy sector  power projects by 10% in      \n  Inner Mongolia by 2013    \u2022 Stable and consistent \n      regulatory policies for \nMitigation of  Project generates savings    the renewable energy \ngreenhouse gas  of about 140,000 tons of    sector and private \nemissions  CO2 annually during the  sector investment \n  first 25 years of operation   \n \n       \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \nInstallation and  Completion of  Joint venture reports  \u2022 Construction and O&M \noperation at  construction by October    contractors perform in a \ndesigned  2009  Statistics and  timely manner and in \nperformance level of    information  accordance with \n49.5 MW wind power  Sale of 133 GWh per year  disclosure by the  guaranteed \ngenerating facility    regulator and state  performance standards \nand associated    government  as per respective \ninfrastructure   agencies  contracts \n     \n ", "Appendix 1      11 \n \nData Sources \nPerformance \nand/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets and/or \nReporting  and Risks \nIndicators \nMechanisms \n   \n  Risks \n   \n  \u2022 Wind conditions are \ninsufficient in meeting \nprojected generation \nlevels \n\u2022 Grid availability is lower \nthan expected \n \n   \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.
