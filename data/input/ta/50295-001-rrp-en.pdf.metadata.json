THE PROJECT \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for the Public Financial Management Project.1 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) proposes to support the Government of the Marshall \nIslands through a project grant to strengthen overall public financial management (PFM). The \nproject will enhance the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to effectively \nimplement PFM and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms. \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Key challenges. The RMI faces natural disadvantages, exposure to shocks, and internal \nbottlenecks that limit growth prospects. It is classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation \nby ADB.2 The RMI depends heavily on external development assistance. A major challenge is \nachieving fiscal sustainability when grants under the Compact of Free Association with the United \nStates expire in 2023.3 Weak management of public finances and SOEs are critical factors \nconstraining the government\u2019s ability to strengthen its fiscal position, and improve financial \nplanning and resource allocation for sectoral priorities.4 However, the RMI lacks the institutional \ncapacity to effectively implement PFM and SOE reforms. \n \n4.  Weak public financial management framework. A 2012 public expenditure and financial \naccountability  (PEFA)  assessment  of    the  RMI\u2019s  PFM  framework  highlighted  significant \nweaknesses,5 including (i) budgets that are not executed as planned across line ministries, \nundermining strategic resource allocation; (ii) significant government spending that is not reflected \nin budget documents; (iii) weak links between planning and budgeting processes; (iv) frequent \nbudget reallocations that further delink policy priorities from sectoral allocations; (v) accounting \nand  reporting  limitations  that  hamper  budget  execution  monitoring;  (vi)  weaknesses  in  tax \nadministration and management; and (vii) the absence of effective external scrutiny and audit, \nand limited follow-up of audit findings. The absence of a dedicated MOF website makes it difficult \nto effectively communicate PFM reforms to stakeholders (including the public). \n \n5.  A  2016  assessment  further  found  that,  over  the  last  several  years,  the  MOF  has \nexperienced high turnover and loss of senior staff, and has received diminished support for 4Gov, \nthe  Marshall  Islands\u2019  financial  management  information  system  (FMIS). 6  The  report \nrecommended  that  technical  assistance  (TA)  be  mobilized  to  (i)  strengthen  professional \naccounting capacity;7 (ii) improve human resource development, training, and processes to \naddress staff turnover and vacancies, and low staff morale; and (iii) ensure an FMIS acquisition \nprocess to replace 4Gov that with an appropriate system software solution. \n                                                \n1  The project was prepared under Asian Development Bank. 2013.

However, budgetary grants total about a third of GDP; when grants are excluded the fiscal deficit \nover FY2012\u2013FY2016 was almost 31% of GDP. \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n5  Government of the Marshall Islands. 2012.

Majuro. \n7  The MOF relies on their external auditor to prepare annual financial statements. Although the financial statements \nhave received a clean opinion, they have not met audit completion deadlines since 2011. Questionable costs \nidentified by the auditors remain a concern. The most common observations are the lack of documentation and \noutstanding reconciliation among various records. ADB has supported the government to improve documentation. \n ", "2 \n6.  Public Financial Management Reform Roadmap. Based on the PEFA, the government \ndeveloped the PFM Reform Roadmap 2014\u20132016 consisting of 30 reform components.8 The \nRoadmap calls for a governance structure to guide reform implementation, and nonsystem \nmeasures  for  strengthening  coordination  and  oversight,  and  capacity  building.  Key  reform \ncomponents  include  enhancing  aid  coordination for  PFM  reforms,  improving the  budgeting \nframework, strengthening accounting systems and cash management, augmenting internal and \nexternal audit capacity, upgrading human resources (including payroll systems), promoting better \nfiscal  management,  and  monitoring  SOEs.  The  Roadmap  recognizes  the  importance  of \ncommunication and training in PFM reform for greater transparency and sustainability. \n \n7.  Public financial management reform implementation. In December 2015, following \ngeneral  elections,  the  Roadmap  was  endorsed  by  the  Cabinet.  A  PFM  Reform  Steering \nCommittee chaired by the chief secretary was established in March 2016 to provide high-level \nmanagement. The MOF leads efforts to implement the Roadmap. While the authorities are \ncommitted to reforms, the Roadmap lacks systematic prioritization. Together with high turnover \nof staff and insufficient capacity in the MOF, this has meant that the Roadmap remains a wish list, \nwith  limited  progress  in  implementation.  Senior  MOF  staff  are  overloaded  with  multiple \nresponsibilities.  Lower-level  MOF  staff  are  largely  either  high  school  graduates  or  college \ngraduates with liberal arts backgrounds, with inadequate knowledge of economics or accounting.9 \nUnderstanding of the FMIS is weak, except among staff trained in information technology\u2014\nalthough able to operate 4Gov, they often lack the nonsystems financial knowledge required to \ngenerate appropriate reports. \n \n8.  Insufficient capacity constrains the ability of the MOF to effectively coordinate Roadmap \nimplementation. Internal coordination on PFM issues among agencies such as the MOF, the \nEconomic Policy Planning and Statistics Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and line ministries \nis weak\u2014agencies outside the MOF have insufficient understanding of their financial reporting \nresponsibilities, and are often unable to comply with core financial regulations. There is also a \nneed for better development partner coordination. Key partners supporting PFM reforms include \nADB, the World Bank, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), the European \nUnion, and the governments of Australia and the United States.10 The MOF must establish an \neffective coordination mechanism among them to ensure that PFM reform efforts achieve timely \nresults, while avoiding duplication or contradictory advice. \n \n9.  Fiscal burden of state-owned enterprises. The RMI\u2019s SOE sector is one of the weakest \nperformers in the Pacific.11 There are 11 active SOEs involved in utilities, transport, banking, \ntelecommunication, and hotels. In FY2014, these SOEs represented 17%\u201320% of the total capital \nstock of the country, but contributed only 5.3% to gross domestic product (GDP).12 SOEs provide \na range of public services with non-commercial objectives, and receive significant government \ntransfers and access to discounted debt subsidized to fund their community service obligations \n(CSOs). Annual government transfers to SOEs during FY2004\u2013FY2015 averaged 4.1% of GDP, \nand the gap between commercial loan rates and the concessional rates SOEs paid on their debt \naveraged  more  than  7.7%.  The  negative  rates  of  return  and  high  ongoing  government \ncontributions  pose  a  fiscal  burden  that  diverts  money  from  much-needed  social  services. \n                                                \n8  Government of the Marshall Islands. 2014.

", "3 \nStemming the requirement for substantial fiscal transfers to SOEs is a critical part of overall PFM \nreforms. However, because the costs of delivering legitimate CSOs has not been estimated, the \ngovernment is unable to determine whether the subsidies to SOEs are funding CSOs or covering \ninefficiencies. The absence of a centralized monitoring unit for SOEs within the MOF diffuses \nresponsibility and makes it difficult to enforce fiscal discipline. \n \n10.  State-Owned Enterprises Act implementation. The RMI adopted the State-Owned \nEnterprises Act13 in October 2015 to strengthen corporate governance and monitoring of SOEs, \nwith support from ADB through its Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI).14 The SOE Act \nenables  the  commercialization  of  the  SOEs  and  contains  a  sound  corporate  governance \nframework, but has been weakened somewhat by a 2016 amendment that allows elected officials \nto remain on SOE boards. The PSDI TA is assisting in implementation of the SOE Act, including \nthrough  measures  for  greater  transparency,  accountability,  and  disclosure  among  SOEs.15 \nAlthough  the  MOF  is  responsible  for  implementing  the  SOE  Act,  capacity  limitations  and \ninsufficient understanding within the MOF of their SOE monitoring role have constrained effective \nimplementation. Line ministries and senior managers from SOEs are also often unable to meet \nthe reporting and accountability requirements under the SOE Act. \n \n11.  Proposed  solutions.  ADB  proposes  to  support  the  government  through  an  Asian \nDevelopment Fund project grant to address the low institutional capacity of the MOF to effectively \nimplement PFM and SOE reforms, as requested by the government in 2016. The project is aligned \nwith a crosscutting theme of the RMI National Strategic Plan 2015\u20132017, of ensuring and applying \ngood governance principles to achieve effective governance.16 PFM and SOE reforms are two \nstrategic areas under the Plan. The project is consistent with the ADB Pacific Approach 2016\u2013\n2020, which serves as the overall ADB country partnership strategy for the Marshall Islands, and \nsupports the following outcomes: (i) PFM improvements to achieve greater resilience to external \neconomic and financial shocks, and (ii) increased financial efficiency of SOEs to create a more \nconducive environment for business.17 ADB\u2019s approach towards engaging in fragile and conflict-\naffected situations, such as the RMI, recognizes the importance of institutional strengthening and \ncapacity building.18 The project grant is included in ADB\u2019s lending pipeline for 2017.19 The project \nhas been developed in coordination with other development partners (footnote 10). \n \n12.  ADB contributions and lessons. This project builds on prior ADB support to the RMI for \nPFM and SOE reforms. Through two subprograms under the Public Sector Program,20 ADB \nassisted the RMI to adopt and implement reform plans to improve the performance of selected \nSOEs, complete a workforce audit exercise for selected government agencies, and achieve \nvarious expenditure targets. ADB regional TA has helped the RMI improve governance within \nSOEs and develop SOE policy and legislation (para. 10). ADB has helped the government \ndevelop a financial management model, periodically clear its audit backlogs, and\u2014through the \n                                                \n13 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2015.

", "4 \nnational development coordination officer\u2014is providing ongoing technical accounting support to \nthe  MOF.  TA  has  also  been  provided  to  assess  ways  to  improve  aid  coordination.  ADB \nengagement has demonstrated the importance of taking into account the slow pace of reforms in \nthe RMI, having realistic targets in the design and monitoring framework, and providing on-the-\nground support for development partner coordination (footnote 10). Accordingly, the project has \nbeen designed to provide locally based support and allow flexibility in reform implementation. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The Asian Development Fund project grant will (i) help the MOF to prioritize and implement \nthe  RMI\u2019s  PFM  Reform  Roadmap,  and  (ii)  provide  operational  support  to  SOE  reforms, \ncomplementing the policy and legislative support being provided by the PSDI. The project is \naligned with the following impact: more effective governance achieved in the Marshall Islands, in \nline with the National Strategic Plan (para. 11). The project outcome will be improved PFM.21 \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The outputs will be (i) the MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement the PFM Reform \nRoadmap strengthened, and (ii) the MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement SOE reforms \nstrengthened. \n \n15.  Road map implementation. To achieve the first output, a reform coordination unit (RCU) \nwill be established, consisting of five long-term individual consultants reporting to the secretary \nfor finance. The RCU will be largely based in Majuro, to enable provision of on-the-ground support. \nThe RCU will strengthen MOF capacity to implement the PFM Reform Roadmap through advice, \ninputs, and training in close coordination with development partners.22 \n \n16.  The PFM Reform Roadmap consists of 30 reform components. A key reform is improving \ncoordination of development partner assistance (para. 6). Under the oversight of the secretary, \nthe RCU will prepare a sequenced action plan based on the Roadmap. The action plan will form \nthe basis for identifying the specific reform actions to be prioritized and implemented, around \nwhich development partner technical and financial assistance can be mobilized. The RCU will \nsupport the secretary to coordinate internally across government agencies, and externally among \npartners. Although the RCU will not directly support all 30 Roadmap reform components, it will \nadvise the MOF to channel development partner support appropriately.23 \n   \n17.  The RCU consultants will directly build MOF capacity to implement reforms under other \nkey Roadmap components described below, identified in consultation with development partners. \nThey will also help improve PFM data quality through process improvements. Because the reform \nsequence will depend on the action plan to be prepared and the timely availability of development \npartner assistance, in order to allow flexibility, details on the specific reform actions to be \nundertaken within various components will be worked out under the project. \n                                                \n21 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n22 The World Bank expects to provide a $5 million grant in 2018 that seeks to replace 4Gov, update related processes, \nand improve procurement systems. Australian Volunteers International will field a short-term consultant in 2017 to \nhelp develop a human resource upgradation plan for the MOF, and the World Bank expects to fund capacity building \ncourses and programs for MOF staff. PFTAC provides TA in selected areas (e.g., revenue forecasting, national \nincome calculations, and medium-term budgeting), although they have no long-term consultants based in Majuro. \n23 The RCU consultants will take the lead in coordinating reforms in their respective areas of expertise. It is not expected \nthat they will personally undertake all relevant Roadmap reforms, but will seek to achieve results through a mix of \ntheir own expertise, MOF expertise, and, where available, supplementary external expertise using development \npartner resources. ", "5 \n(i)  Budget framework. The RCU will support the MOF to introduce a medium-term \nbudgeting  framework,  and  improve  the  link  between  budget  documents  and \ncorporate  and  sector  planning  processes.  The  RCU  will  guide  the  MOF  in \npreparing  better  budget  analyses  and  documentation,  reviewing  existing \noperational  budgetary  processes,  identifying  gaps,  and  recommending  and \nimplementing improvements, thus improving quality of budgetary data. \n(ii)  Accounting  and  auditing.  The  RCU  will  help  improve  the  application  of \naccounting principles in routine government processes, work with the MOF and \nline ministries to improve cash and asset management, and build a system to \nperform a daily consolidation and reporting of the government\u2019s cash position, all \nof which will improve quality of financial management data. They will recommend \ncore PFM functionalities to serve as minimum requirements in a potential new \nFMIS,  and  advise  on  FMIS  guidelines  and  manuals.  They  will  help  the \ngovernment\u2019s  newly  appointed  internal  auditor  to  implement  audit \nrecommendations,  review  financial  reports,  and  make  recommendations  as \nnecessary.24 They will also support external audit.  \n(iii)  Human resources. The RCU will work with development partners to advise on a \nplan to upgrade the MOF\u2019s human resources, which is slated to be prepared by a \nAustralian Volunteers International (AVI) consultant. The RCU will ensure that the \nplan contains appropriate provisions for training, recruitment, and promotion of \nqualified  women.  The  RCU  will  work  to  implement  the  plan,  coordinate \ndevelopment partner support to prepare job descriptions, fund suitable training \nprograms and courses, and strengthen performance management. The RCU will \nadvise on payroll management, and the development and implementation of a new \nhuman resource management information system. \n \n18.  The RCU will organize at least three structured training sessions per year for MOF \nemployees to strengthen skills required to perform day-to-day PFM functions; the sessions will be \nidentified in the RCU\u2019s annual work plans (para. 25). The RCU will also work closely with the MOF \nand line ministries (through functional hands-on training) to build their capacity to undertake core \nPFM tasks under their areas of expertise. The RCU will support implementation of the human \nresources upgradation plan, and mobilize partner funding for formal training courses (footnote 9). \n \n19.  State-owned enterprise reform implementation. Under the second output, the MOF\u2019s \ncapacity to identify, assess the cost of, and monitor legitimate CSOs will be enhanced. The project \ngrant will support the appointment of two SOE reform experts, who will work closely with the PSDI \nand be part of the RCU for the duration of their recruitment. One expert will help identify legitimate \nCSOs and assess their costs, with a focus on those SOEs that receive the largest government \nsubsidies. 25 This will allow the government to evaluate whether subsidies are funding legitimate \nCSOs or SOE inefficiencies, which will be the first step towards reforming inefficient SOEs by \nstreamlining subsidies to match public service delivery costs. A second expert will help establish \nan SOE monitoring unit within the MOF, drawing on existing MOF staff. The expert will help build \ncapacity within the unit to monitor SOE performance and ensure the government gets value-for-\nmoney from its fiscal support to SOEs. Limiting SOE subsidies to CSOs will strengthen the \ndiscipline on SOEs, help equalize competition with commercially viable businesses, and improve \nthe environment for private sector growth.26 \n                                                \n24 The MOF has recruited an internal auditor in 2017. \n25 Five SOEs accounted for 83% of all government subsidies to SOEs during FY2004\u2013FY2015: the Kwajalein Atoll \nJoint Utility Resources, the Tobolar Copra Processing Authority, the Marshall Islands Shipping Corporation, Air \nMarshall Islands, and the Marshalls Energy Company. \n26 The International Monetary Fund has also highlighted that clarifying SOE CSOs and establishing a centralized ", "6 \nD.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $2.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project. The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of staff time, office space and supplies, taxes and duties, secretarial assistance, and \nother in-kind contributions estimated at $0.3 million (Table 2). The project will act to improve \ndevelopment  partner  coordination,  as  the  RCU  (once  established)  can  help  to  channel \ndevelopment funds towards appropriate PFM activities and coordinate with parallel financed \ninitiatives. Therefore, although there is no immediate partner cofinancing, parallel financing is \nexpected to be mobilized during project implementation (footnote 22). \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \n     Special Funds (Asian Development Fund) resources (grant)  2,000,000  87.0 \nGovernment of the Marshall Islands (in-kind contributions)  300,000  13.0 \nTotal  2,300,000  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.

", "7 \nmonths each as RCU team members to support capacity building and reforms in accounting and \nauditing.29 Two individual national consultants, preferably with government experience, will be \nrecruited for 33 person-months each as RCU members: one PFM specialist to work on budget \nframework  reforms  and  capacity  building,  and  one  human  resource  specialist  to  work  on \nupgrading  the  MOF\u2019s  human  resources  and  capacity.30 For  SOE  reforms,  the  project  is \nadditionally expected to mobilize 6 person-months each of two individual international consultants \n(para. 19). In the selection of consultants, preference will be given to qualified women. \n \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 27). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2017\u2013December 2020 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2020 \nEstimated grant closing date  30 June 2021 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Public Financial Management Reform Steering Committee \nChief Secretary (chair) \nSecretary for Finance (member) \nAuditor General (member) \nAttorney General (member) \nChair of the Public Service Commission (member) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii)  Implementing agency  Reform coordination unit \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Reform coordination unit, five staff (i) advisor, (ii) public finance specialist, (iii) two \nfinancial management specialists, and (iv) human resource specialist \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection  144 person-months  $1.756 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for consultants \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed following the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n25.  Based on the Roadmap action plan (para. 16), the RCU will prepare annual work plans \noutlining capacity-building measures, training sessions to be organized, and specific reform \nactions to be implemented. The RCU will be required to submit biannual progress reports \n(including on gender actions) against their work plans to the MOF for their performance review. \nEvaluation of their performance will also consider the findings of assessments by ADB and \ndevelopment partners.31 The RCU will provide biannual updates to the PFM Reform Steering \nCommittee on reform progress and outstanding issues requiring high-level intervention. \n \n26.  Capacity will be built within the government to implement Roadmap and SOE reforms, \nwhich will help to sustain reforms (para. 18). The two national RCU consultants can potentially be \nabsorbed within the MOF at the end of the project. However, given the shortage of qualified staff \nin the RMI, it is possible that further support in the form of an RCU will be needed. If the project \nis judged to be performing well, ADB will make efforts to involve development partners in funding \nthe RCU. Additional financing by ADB may also be considered. \n                                                \n29 The MOF requested two financial management specialists with expertise in accounting, as capacity in this field is \nparticularly weak. This is in line with external analysis (para. 5). The human resource assessment undertaken under \nproject preparatory TA confirmed that, of 78 MOF staff in position in June 2017, only 4 had university degrees in \naccounting. The MOF, unusually, often relies on external auditors to prepare annual financial statements. \n30 The remuneration of the national consultants will be benchmarked to the MOF salary scales, taking into account their \nexperience and qualifications.  \n31 This includes ADB\u2019s country performance assessments for the Marshall Islands and the next PEFA study. ", "8 \n27.  ADB will continue close coordination with development partners to ensure that respective \nreform efforts are complementary. The World Bank is also expected to provide support for RMI \nPFM activities, with an initial focus on the FMIS and reporting processes (footnote 22). Once \nestablished and functional, the RCU can provide advice and inputs on adoption of the most \nappropriate FMIS solution, and help to identify and implement the core nonsystems improvements \nneeded to ensure a timely, user-friendly replacement for 4Gov. PFTAC is also assisting the \ngovernment to develop a medium-term fiscal framework. The RCU can work with PFTAC to build \nthe MOF\u2019s capacity to undertake fiscal work, providing continuity to the intermittent PFTAC \nsupport from experts who visit Majuro periodically. The RCU human resource specialist will \ncoordinate with the AVI consultant to support the development and implementation of a plan to \nupgrade the MOF\u2019s human resources, and help mobilize partner support to fund formal training \nprograms to strengthen MOF capacity. \n \nII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n28.  The project is expected to generate substantial economic benefits.32 Direct benefits will \ncome from a reduction in SOE subsidies\u2014CSOs will be identified and their costs determined, and \nfinancing for SOE inefficiencies reduced. Scope exists to reduce the fiscal burden of SOE \nsubsidies, which totaled 6.4% of the RMI GDP in FY2015, significantly higher than in comparator \nNorth Pacific economies.33 Under a conservative scenario, if SOE subsidies in the RMI are \ngradually reduced to 5.9% of GDP by FY2020 and maintained until FY2022 through reforms, \nproject benefits can reach $5.1 million. The project-related benefit-to-cost ratio is estimated at \n2.2:1.0.  This  excludes  other  efficiency  gains  in  government  expenditure  through  PFM \nimprovements that are more difficult to quantify. The project is thus considered economically \nbeneficial, particularly given potentially large second-order effects on broader economic growth \nand social welfare from improvements in the quality and efficiency of public expenditure. Ensuring \nreforms are sustainable may require further development partner assistance after project closure \n(para. 26). \n \nB.  Governance \n29.  Financial management. A project financial management assessment was prepared for \nthe  MOF,  which  indicated  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  was \nsubstantial. Various weaknesses were identified that could affect project implementation (para. \n4). Once the RCU is established, qualified consultants will work closely with the MOF to implement \nPFM reforms and provide institutional support to the MOF, thus helping to mitigate inherent risks. \nTo mitigate control risks, ADB will generally pay international consultants using direct payment \nprocedures. The RCU will prepare invoices and withdrawal applications for MOF review prior to \nADB endorsement. An advance account will be set up, and administered by the MOF with RCU \nassistance. The advance account ceiling will not exceed $100,000, and will generally be used for \nsmall  payments  (e.g.,  training  materials,  workshops,  project  operational  expenses,  and \nremuneration of national consultants). The MOF will cause detailed consolidated project financial \nstatements to be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with \nInternational Standards on Auditing and the government\u2019s audit regulations. The audited project \nfinancial statements together with the auditors\u2019 opinion will be submitted to ADB within 6 months \nof the end of the fiscal year by the MOF. With these mitigation measures in place, the project \nfinancial management inherent and control risks are assessed to be moderate. \n                                                \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 SOE subsidies average only 0.4% of GDP in the Federated States of Micronesia, and 0.8% of GDP in Palau. ", "9 \n30.  Procurement. A procurement capacity assessment of the MOF was undertaken, and \nfound substantial overall pre-mitigation procurement risk. The following issues could affect project \nprocurement: (i) weak external aid coordination, (ii) inadequate prior experience with international \nprocurement  of  consultants,  (iii)  absence  of  reliable  data  on  procurement  contracts,  (iv) \ninsufficient capacity of staff to carry out procurement, and (v) inadequate documentation and \nmonitoring on procurement. To mitigate risks, consultant recruitment will be delegated to ADB by \nthe RMI authorities. Further, only individual consultants will be procured under the project, and \ncontracts  are  not  complex  or  high  value.  All  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). With these mitigation measures in place, the project financial \nmanagement inherent and control risks are assessed to be low. \n \n31.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto, and discussed with, the government. ADB will conduct integrity due diligence for consultants. \nAnticorruption issues will be built into the training sessions provided by the RCU, as appropriate. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n32.  The project will contribute to poverty reduction through (i) better PFM systems, which  will \nalign budget allocations with sectoral priorities, reduce fiscal deficits, and improve government \ncapacity to deal with external shocks; (ii) increased efficiency of SOEs, which will reduce the fiscal \nburden of transfers, and free resources for development; and (iii) more transparent identification \nand funding of CSOs, which will help the government minimize the costs of inefficiencies, adjust \nsubsidies, and contract out CSOs. Additional development resources will enable the government \nto meet the poverty- and access-related objectives in the National Strategic Plan, and improve \nthe quality of education and health care, which currently absorb about half the budget. Greater \nresilience to shocks will benefit the poor.34 \n \n33.  The project is classified as having some gender elements as it promotes women\u2019s \nempowerment through targets for women\u2019s participation in project training activities and in MOF \nmanagement positions. Of 78 staff working in the MOF as of June 2017, 39.7% are women. \nHowever, women are underrepresented in MOF management, with only 3 women (including the \nsecretary) among the 16 occupied management positions (secretary, assistant secretary, division \nand/or section head) in the Majuro and Ebeye finance offices. The RCU will work with the AVI \nconsultant on a plan to upgrade the MOF\u2019s human resources, and propose positive discrimination \nmeasures in recruitment and promotions to be discussed with the Public Services Commission \n(para. 17). The MOF is committed to raising the proportion of women in management above the \nbaseline, subject to qualifications. In the hiring of RCU consultants, the project will encourage the \nselection of qualified women. The RCU will be tasked with ensuring and monitoring that women \nmake up at least 35% of trainees in training sessions they organize for the MOF and relevant line \nministries and/or agencies (para. 18). Biannual progress reports prepared by the RCU will include \ngender-disaggregated data and report on gender actions. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory C for the environment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement, because the \nproject proposes only advisory inputs.35 No civil works are planned, and there is no potential for \n                                                \n34 The National Strategic Plan themes include empowering people and communities to reduce the incidence of \u201caccess \nrelated\u201d poverty through social, economic environment, governance, and infrastructure improvements, and provision \nof necessary services to outer island residents to enable all RMI citizens to enjoy a high quality of life. \n35 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. ", "10 \ninvoluntary land acquisition resulting in physical and economic displacement. The dominant \npopulation of the RMI is indigenous to the islands, and project activities are designed for the entire \neconomy, with no differentiation in benefits accruing to any group. In the absence of any civil \nworks, there will be no environmental impacts. \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n35.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.36 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nKey Processing Issues  Proposed Approaches and/or Mitigation Measures \nExternal shocks divert  The project supports the government to build fiscal resilience.

The government and the MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft grant agreement.  \n \nIV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$2,000,000 to the Republic of the Marshall Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the Public Financial Management Project, on terms and conditions that \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n21 September 2017 \n                                                \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
