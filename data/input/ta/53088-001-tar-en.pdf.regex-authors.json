INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Agricultural production and rural livelihoods have lagged behind industrial production and \nurban livelihoods in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). As a result, income inequality and \npoverty persist in rural areas of lesser-developed regions. The majority of rural wastewater and \nwastes are directly discharged to the environment without appropriate treatment and disposal. \nAgainst this backdrop, the Government of the PRC formulated the rural vitalization strategy for \n2018\u20132022 to promote poverty reduction, rural development, and green and inclusive growth.1 \nThe strategy focuses on agriculture modernization, rural wastewater and waste management, \nrural\u2013urban  integration,  ecosystem  services  protection,  rural  health  and  education  services \ndevelopment,  and  rural  governance  reform.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the \ngovernment have agreed to adopt a framework approach to strategically design ADB\u2019s lending \nand nonlending program to provide support for the PRC\u2019s rural vitalization initiatives. \n \n2.  This  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  specifically  support  the \npreparation of guidelines on rural sanitation, wastewater, and solid-waste management (SWM) in \nline with the priorities of the rural vitalization strategy, the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan of the PRC2 \nto achieve inclusive and sustainable growth by 2020; ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the \nPRC, 2016\u20132020;3 and ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u201320204 to expand knowledge work \nand increase efficiency of sanitation and wastewater management. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u201320215 and is aligned with key operational \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030,6 especially environmental sustainability.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The government has been promoting rural development with specific targets identified in \n \nthe Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 (footnote 2).In addition to helping alleviate poverty and \npromoting development of rural areas, rural vitalization focuses on building ecologically friendly \nand livable villages by improving the rural living environment and addressing rural environmental \ninfrastructure to reduce nonpoint source pollution. This is particularly important as poor sanitation \nand wastewater pollution control continues to be a key environmental issue in rural areas, and \nthe slow progress in addressing this problem is putting further pressure on rural ecological assets. \n \n4.  Since the enforcement of the reform and open policy, the PRC has experienced rapid \neconomic and social development in its rural areas. However, the economic conditions and the \nliving environment in rural towns and villages  lag behind those in urban areas. Thus, the \ngovernment identified rural vitalization as key to ensuring future economic development and \nenvironmental improvement in rural areas. The strategy requires efforts to solve outstanding \nenvironmental problems and actions to improve the rural environment. In particular, support to \nrural development necessitates suitable approaches to (i) improving access to rural sanitation, \nSWM, and wastewater management; (ii) improving rural infrastructure and capacity development; \n(iii) controlling pollution; (iv) improving rural financial services; and (v) modernizing agriculture. \n \n1  Government of the PRC. 2018.

In 2017, the PRC\u2019s rural population was approximately 590 million, while only about 25% \nof rural villagers access appropriate sanitation facilities.8 Simple pit latrines are widely used in \nrural areas. Most villagers face poor sanitation and hygiene conditions because of inadequate, \noutdated, and/or faulty sanitary facilities. In the southeastern provinces of the PRC, flush toilets \nare installed in households but wastewater is discharged into leaking septic tanks underneath \nhouses, putting both personal hygiene and public health under threat. In 2015, the government, \nin its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (footnote 2), mandated that by 2020 sanitation systems shall be \ninstalled in at least 70% of rural villages in the PRC. During 2014\u20132018, there has been rapid \ndevelopment of rural sanitation throughout the country. \n \n6.  International best practice has proven that rural sanitation facilities can be designed and \nmanaged in accordance with local criteria, including affordability, local people\u2019s operating and \nmanaging skills, influent flow and strength, local water self-purification capacity, effluent reuses, \nclimate conditions, and land constraints.9 The government has adopted rigorous provincial rural \nwastewater discharge standards and standardized technologies that may be inappropriate for \nlocal conditions, are heavily dependent on government subsidies, and lack the engagement of \nvillagers.  Consequently,  many  constructed  facilities  have  not  been  properly  operated  or \nmaintained, sewers and onsite treatment plants are poorly designed and constructed, there is \nweak regulatory enforcement on effluent quality control, and there are financial difficulties in \nmaintaining proper operation. It is estimated that more than two-thirds of rural wastewater \nsystems are not properly functioning. There are also no practical guidelines available in the PRC \nto assist local officials and planners with designing, building, and managing rural sanitation. \n \n7.  Shanxi province has a large rural population. The rural semiarid areas of the province \nhave problems with inadequate sanitation, SWM, and wastewater management systems. The \nnatural conditions, ecological background, living habits, and economic conditions of rural areas \nof  the  province  make  it  difficult  to  adopt  uniform  rural  sanitation,  SWM,  and  wastewater \nmanagement in different areas. Because of the scattered villages and difficult terrain, the logistics \nof transporting the large per capita wastewater and solid-waste output has long been a challenge. \nAn  effective  and  innovative  solution  is  the  Shanxi  province  focus  on  accelerating  poverty \nalleviation and rural vitalization through improving the living environment. \n \n8.  Henan province has serious rural sanitation, SWM, and wastewater management issues. \nBoth the financial capacity and farmers\u2019 environmental awareness are weak. As Henan has a \nlarge rural population, agricultural development and rural environmental management are crucial \ntasks.  Shortage  of  investments  and  absence  of  long-term  financing  mechanisms  are  key \nrestrictions  on  rural  sanitation,  SWM,  and  wastewater  management.  Moreover,  effective \nmanagement of rural sanitation, SWM, and wastewater management is inadequate. As a result \nof substantial funding gaps, the construction and operation and maintenance of such projects \nhave limited coverage. There is no effective fund-sharing mechanism among levels of government, \nor private participation. \n \n \n \n8  Appropriate sanitation facilities are sanitation systems where everybody benefits from adequate and inclusive \nsanitation service solutions, human waste is safely managed along the whole sanitation service chain, and effective \nresource recovery and reuse are considered. Appropriate sanitation systems, including for public use, whether \nsewered or nonsewered or centralized or decentralized, consider the most appropriate and innovative technology \nand service delivery method, which may include public\u2013private partnerships (countywide inclusive sanitation). \n9  In the United States, for instance, rural people still use septic systems or onsite treatment plants to treat sewage in \ntheir backyards. The state provides practical manuals, which detail design criteria for various soil conditions, \nlocations, flow projection, technologies, and technical specifications. Households are responsible for their sewage \ntreatment and compliance. At the rural level, the state subsidizes small-scale treatment plants. \n \n ", "3 \n9.  The National Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022 (footnote 1) has become a \nnational policy set out by the government to promote poverty reduction, rural development, and \ngreen and inclusive growth. The strategy has particularly specified the promotion of localized rural \nsanitation and wastewater management models, and provision of technical support and guidance \nto  practitioners.  In  August  2018,  ADB  and  the  government  reached  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding to support the rural vitalization strategy, which prioritizes rural sanitation and \nwastewater management to build ecologically friendly and livable rural villages.10 The TA is \naligned with the strategy of ADB and the government to (i) disseminate experiences in innovative, \ndemonstrative, and replicable pilot projects, and new cooperation modalities; and (ii) develop \nguidelines with online information for planning and management of rural sanitation. \n \n10.  Taking the management of sanitation and wastewater in rural areas as a priority, the TA \nwill provide policy advice and guidelines, capacity development, and knowledge exchange, which \nwill strengthen rural ecological and environmental management and systems. In line with local \ngovernment priorities and needs, the TA will also assist the National Development and Reform \nCommission (NDRC) to develop a set of issue-focused, high-quality projects to maximize ADB \nfunding support and knowledge. The pilot study in Shanxi province will help explore appropriate \nsuitable technology for the local conditions for rural sanitation and wastewater. The Henan \nprovince study will provide the financing and legislative reviews for effective sanitation, SWM, and \nwastewater  management.  It  will  explore  financing  mechanisms  and  raise  awareness  and \ninstitutional implementation of the rural vitalization strategy, which has major impacts on rural \nwastewater and sanitation. \nIII.
