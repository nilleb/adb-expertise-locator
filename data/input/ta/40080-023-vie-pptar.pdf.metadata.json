Justification \n1  This project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is needed to develop sustainable \nlow carbon urban transport programs and projects in Ha Noi. The objective of the PPTA is to \nensure integration of public transport occurs in six districts along Metro Line 3. The outcome of \nthe  PPTA  will  be  the  identification  of  energy  efficient  urban  transport  solutions  which,  in \nconjunction with the Ha Noi Metro line 3 project13, can lead to significant greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemission reductions for Ha Noi. The assistance will focus on identifying and developing a series \nof innovative and transformational interventions, which enhance the quality of public transport \nsystems and which can significantly increase the modal share of public transport in Ha Noi. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2  Overview of the PPTA: The PPTA will be conducted in two phases, firstly to evaluate \nand determine suitable measures, then secondly to design the agreed measures.  The first \nphase  will  evaluate  existing  urban  transport  developments  in  Ha  Noi,  determine  suitable \nmeasures that can be implemented along metro Line 3 and recommend an overall program for \nconsideration  by  government  and  ADB.    Proposed  measures  could  include  physical \ninfrastructure, further studies, capacity building and changes to relevant policies or regulations. \nThis will be the basis for agreement with the government for project definition under the loan at \nthe first tripartite meeting.  For the measures that are agreed by government and ADB, the \nsecond phase will further conceptualize and undertake necessary feasibility design to prepare \nthe project loan for ADB financing.  The final project loan scope will be agreed at the second \ntripartite meeting. \n \n3  The PPTA will focus on three key areas that are expected to ensure that Metro Line 3 is \nwell  integrated,  being  (i)  improved  accessibility  for  Metro  Line  3  stations,  (ii)  improved \nconnectivity for public transport serving the Metro line 3, and (iii) policy and regulatory changes \nto encourage public transport usage and discourage private vehicles. \n \n4  The PPTA will consist of the following two components under each focal area: \n \n\u2022  Component  1:  Assessment  and  definition  of  public  transport  measures  to  be \nimplemented under the Project in the three main areas including: \n(i)  Improved connectivity for Metro Line 3 stations: Assessment and development of \nmeasures,  including;  Metro  station  enhancements,  improved  pedestrian \ninfrastructure including pedestrian priorities and facilities to and from stations, \ntraffic management measures at junctions in proximity of stations, restricting \nparking on public pavements and commercial development opportunities \n(ii) Integrated and innovative public transport services and measures connecting to \nMetro line 3 stations: detailed plan to reorganize and improve the public transport \nnetwork  connected  to  Metro  Line  3,  including  (a)  a  plan  for  routing  and \nrationalization of public transport routes and franchising arrangements, (b) a \nprogram for public transport fleet renewal to promote low emission vehicles that \nare suitable to serve different levels of demand in various areas of the city, (c) \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2010.

The  PPTA  will  closely  coordinate  with  ongoing  technical  assistance \nprovided by the World Bank to Department of Transport (DOT) for bus sector improvements, \nwhich is expected to be undertaken from 2010 to 2015.  ADB proposes concurrent assistance to \ndevelop sustainable urban transport in Ho Chi Minh City for MRT line 2, and both projects\u2019 \npreparation and implementation will be closely coordinated, including between respective city \ngovernments.  Coordination of urban transport measures will be enhanced by holding both \ninformal and joint meetings between transport officials from Ha Noi and HCMC.  \n \n6  The government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project.
