The TA will also bolster capacity for \ncontract  management,  administration,  and  procurement.  Feasibility  studies  and  detailed \nengineering designs will be financed by the RBL and verified by TA consultants to ensure \ncompliance with technical standards. A methodology and framework for technical auditing will be \ndeveloped in the first year of RBL program implementation. The TA will also develop capacity of \nthe implementing agency to conduct climate change risk assessment for selection of WSS \ndevelopment. \n \n6.  Output 2: Monitoring and evaluation system for program indicators improved. This \noutput will support crucial program monitoring functions required for timely and effective program \nimplementation. The TA will develop the capacity of the DDWSSD and ARIS in tracking (i) the \nindicators in the program design and monitoring framework, and DLIs; (ii) the PAP; and (iii) \ncompliance with the RBL program agreement. Key activities include (i) the preparation of results-\nbased annual work plans and budget in line with the targets in the program results framework; (ii) \nthe preparation of annual performance and progress reports; (iii) conduct of annual fiduciary \nreviews and launch of timely actions, if needed; (iv) monitoring of the implementation of the \nfinancial management action plan; (v) review of financial management reports and audit reports \nwith  recommendations  for  corrective  action;  (vi)  assistance  to  the  DDWSSD  and  ARIS  in \nimproving their monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems, as recommended by the program M&E \nassessment (including institutional arrangements; sex-disaggregated data collection, analysis, \nand reporting; and generation of more efficient national and regional reports through an improved \nweb-based program performance management system); and (vii) related training. \n \nC.
