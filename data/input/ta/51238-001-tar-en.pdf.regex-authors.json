INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \nGovernment of Mongolia to reform business processes of tax administration and develop a quality \nbase design for a comprehensive tax administration information system (TAIS). The mission \nvisited Ulaanbaatar and met with officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Mongolian Tax \nAuthority (MTA) from 20 to 22 June 2017, during which an understanding was reached on the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The proposed TA is a continuation of support by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nstrengthening public financial management in Mongolia. The previous capacity development TA \nfor Transparency and Efficiency in Public Financial Management approved in 2014 provided \ninstitutional support, including capacity building and policy advisory assistance, to the MOF to \nimprove transparency and efficiency in public investment and taxation by using information and \ncommunication technology (ICT).1 The TA is closely aligned with the country partnership strategy \nand has been included in the country operations and business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Mongolia, as \nstrengthening public management is one of its cross-cutting themes, to be achieved by improving \nthe transparency and accountability of the management systems of the public sector for effective \nresource utilization.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  A stable and efficient taxation system is (i) fundamental in making the government more \nefficient  and  accountable,  and (ii)  needed to  support  national  economic  development  in a \nsustainable manner. Adoption of ICT for taxation is a promising approach to improve efficiency \nand transparency in tax administration. Successful e-tax administration is expected to increase \ntaxation  efficiency  by  reducing  administrative  costs,  enhancing  transparency,  providing \nconvenience  to  taxpayers,  and  increasing  tax  compliance.  The  TAIS  will  address  the \nadministrative needs of the MTA and the tax compliance requirements of taxpayers. Therefore, \nthe TAIS needs to incorporate various taxation functions\u2014for taxpayer registration, return filing, \nand tax payment\u2014and be an interactive system that supports various users (e.g., taxpayers, tax \nagency staff, and statutory auditors). Hence, establishing a comprehensive TAIS will require \nsubstantial investments and institutional capacities to maintain the system in a sustainable \nmanner. \n \n4.  The  MTA  is  comprised  of  the  General  Department  of  Taxation  of  the  MOF,  tax \ndepartments and offices of the capital city and provinces, tax units in districts, and state tax \ninspectors.  The  MTA  identified  ICT  as  a  key  enabler  in  addressing  the  complexities  and \nchallenges in the taxation environment in the country. The MTA began adopting ICT for taxation \nin the early 2000s. Since then, the MTA has implemented approximately 30 ICT systems for tax \nadministration and other support functions. Some of these systems have been discontinued, but \nsignificant portions of such systems are still in use and each system caters to a specific business \nfunction of the MTA. As of 2012, electronic tax returns accounted for about 77% of the total \ncollected value-added tax, 20% of the income tax, and 15% of the withholding tax. The MTA has \nalso been establishing an online data exchange system to link the taxation system with other \ngovernment agencies.  \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Transparency and Efficiency in Public Financial Management. \nManila.  \n2 ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u20132020. Manila; and ADB. 2017. Country Operations \nBusiness  Plan: Mongolia, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  While the various existing tax ICT systems in the MTA have delivered certain benefits to \nstakeholders, they have also resulted in creating stand-alone systems and islands of data, posing \nnew challenges to the MTA in terms of integrating these systems into effective compliance \nmanagement, revenue realization, and integrated service delivery to taxpayers. Maintenance of \nsuch a large number of systems can also be challenging for the MTA, which has constrained ICT \nresources.  Business  processes  and  procedures  related  to  tax  administration  (business \narchitecture) are complex, and the lack of a standard process is one of the most serious obstacles \na tax agency faces when it adopts ICT as part of its taxation system. Some of these systems in \nthe MTA were developed during 2002\u20132007 and may not follow international good practices \nbased on standard processes and procedures for tax administration. \n \n6.  During 2009\u20132015, the MTA also made an attempt to replace many of its existing ICT \napplications with a new and common ICT system for tax administration. The MTA procured an \noff-the-shelf e-tax application and made efforts to implement and operationalize the system. \nHowever, the lack of (i) adequate and sustained institutional support within the MTA, (ii) internal \nstaff capacities, and (iii) funding for maintenance impeded implementation of this new system and \nthe  General  Department  of  Taxation  eventually    shelved  efforts  to  implement  it.  Lack  of \ninstitutional structures, such as lack of a dedicated project management office to manage \nimplementation,  is  also  seen  as  a  critical factor that  has  impacted  efforts  to  implement  a \ncomprehensive tax ICT system in the MTA.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  government  is  now  planning  to  adopt  a  holistic  approach  for  planning  and \nimplementing the new TAIS application based on its experiences and has sought assistance from \nADB to support this initiative. It proposes to (i) implement the TAIS to replace existing information \ntechnology systems in the MTA, and (ii) integrate the TAIS with current e-services applications \nsuch as e-tax and the value-added tax promotion system. \n \n8.  The TA is a continuation of ADB support for strengthening fiscal management in Mongolia. \nIt will provide further assistance to support the MTA to establish an e-taxation system, with \nparticular attention to the support needed during the design and development of the TAIS, and \ntaking into consideration international good practices and lessons learned from previous attempts \nto implement an e-taxation system in Mongolia. The TA will deploy a team of international and \nnational experts with expertise in TAISs and applications design and implementation. In particular, \nthe TA will focus on (i) supporting the MTA in reviewing and reengineering its current business \nprocesses of tax administration in line with good practices and optimizing the processes prior to \ntheir automation; (ii) scoping and planning for TAIS implementation, including functional coverage \nof the TAIS, integration requirements, and ICT infrastructure needs for TAIS implementation; (iii) \nsupporting the MTA in reviewing and finalizing functional and system requirement specifications \nand architecture for the new TAIS; (iv) providing the necessary capacity building support; and (v) \nproviding technical oversight and support during the development stage of the TAIS. \n \n9.  The TA  is  aligned  with  the following  impact: public financial  resource  management \nenhanced (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: efficiency of tax administration \nsystems in Mongolia strengthened.3 \n                                                \n3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n10.  Output 1: Preliminary scoping and planning for tax administration information \nsystem  design  approved  by  the  Mongolian  Tax  Authority.  The  TA  will  (i)  review  and \nreengineer the MTA\u2019s current business processes in line with international good practices in tax \nadministration;  and  (ii)  provide  necessary  support  in  scoping  and  planning  for  TAIS \nimplementation, including functional coverage of the TAIS, integration requirements, and ICT \ninfrastructure needs for TAIS implementation. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Tax  administration  information  system  design  prepared,  including \nfunctional and system requirements definition prepared. Based on the preliminary scoping \nand planning for the TAIS, the TA will review and finalize functional and system requirement \nspecifications and architecture for the new TAIS. The final design will be presented to and \napproved by the executing agency (i.e., the MTA) and ADB.  During the development stage of the \nTAIS design, the consultant team will provide technical oversight and support, and produce \nperiodic reports on the progress of the system development based on the initial TAIS design. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Capacity  in  administering  and  managing  TAIS  improved.  A  capacity \ndevelopment plan for required skills and staff will be prepared, and technical training workshops \nand seminars will be arranged and conducted.   \n \n13.  Strategic fit. The TA will support the government to continue its reform efforts in public \nfinancial resource management by strengthening tax collection, administration, and management. \nThe design of the TA follows ADB\u2019s sector and thematic operational plan, and Financial Sector \nOperational Plan.4 The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia, \n2017\u201320205 and the Government Action Plan, 2016\u201320206 in sustaining inclusive economic \ngrowth, and improving the transparency and accountability of the management systems of the \npublic sector to help that the financial resources of both ADB and the government are used \nappropriately and effectively. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $450,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of data access, office space, \nlogistics support, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented from September 2017 to August 2019. The executing agency \nwill be the MTA, and the Information Technology Statistics Center under the MTA will be the \nimplementing agency. The advance payment facility procedure will be adopted following ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook (2010,  as  amended from time to time)  and \nestablished with the MOF to facilitate timely organization of training, seminar, and conference \nactivities.
