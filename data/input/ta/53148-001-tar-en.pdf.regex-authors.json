INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  regional  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive framework to promote tourism development and cooperation in \nthe  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  region,  including  through  the \nformulation of a CAREC tourism strategy leading to 2030 and a regional investment framework \nwith projects to be implemented from 2021 to 2025. The TA will also seek to enhance the capacity \nof government agencies to collect and analyze tourism statistics, undertake market research, and \npromote dialogue and information-sharing between public and private tourism stakeholders in the \nregion. \n \n2.  The TA supports the implementation of the CAREC 2030 strategy, as tourism is one of its \noperational priorities under cluster 2 (trade, tourism, and economic corridor development).1 The \nTA follows a comprehensive approach as it builds on and continues the work completed under \nTA for Enhancing Coordination of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program and \nImplementing the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation 2030 Strategy for Sustainable \nRegional Development.2 These TA projects have supported the initiation of the work of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the tourism sector in the CAREC region through the development of \na scoping study on promoting regional tourism cooperation under CAREC 2030, and the conduct \nof the first regional tourism workshop under the CAREC Program in 2018.3 The TA aligns well \nwith ADB Strategy 2030 as it supports two of its operational priorities\u2014operational priority 7 on \nfostering regional cooperation and integration, and operational priority 4 on making cities more \nlivable\u2014as well as the promotion of technological development and digital transformation in \nseveral ADB developing member countries.4 The TA is also aligned with the Operational Plan for \nRegional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020.5 Tourism development is included in the \nnational  strategies  of  CAREC  countries  as  a  means  to  achieve  sustainable  and  inclusive \neconomic growth.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Since  its  inception  in  2001,  the  CAREC  Program  has  strongly  supported  regional \nconnectivity  and  economic  corridor  development.7  As  CAREC  countries  become  more \ninterconnected, they also need to work together to maximize the economic opportunities resulting \nfrom greater transport connectivity. Tourism can create and deepen socioeconomic and cultural \nties across countries, improve connectivity, and foster better dialogue by bringing people and \nnations  closer  together.  Tourism  development  can  be  instrumental  in  promoting  economic \ndiversification and job creation, and can help improve the economic viability of undertaking \nregional connectivity and economic corridor investments. It can also promote gender equality \nthrough job and income-generation opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises and \nentrepreneurs, including women and other vulnerable groups. \n \n                                                \n1  CAREC Secretariat. 2017.

Manila. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 May 2019. \n7  The CAREC Program is a partnership of 11 member countries (Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and \ndevelopment partners, working to promote development through cooperation, leading to accelerated economic \ngrowth and shared prosperity. \n ", "2 \n4.  Since 2010, tourism has experienced continued growth. In 2018, the tourism sector \naccounted for 10.4% of global gross domestic product and supported 319 million jobs, or 1 in 10 \njobs globally. International tourist arrivals reached 1.4 billion in 2018, a 6% increase from 2017. \nAsia and the Pacific was the second most visited region after Europe, with 343 million international \narrivals. However, many CAREC countries lag behind other Asian economies when it comes to \ntourism development. In 2018, the aggregate volume of tourist arrivals amounted to almost 20 \nmillion  and  the  tourism  sector  supported  6.3 million  jobs  in  the  CAREC  region (excluding \nAfghanistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China and Turkmenistan).8 Taken in a global context, \nhowever, these figures represent less than 2% of global tourist arrivals and total employment in \nthe tourism sector. In 2018, tourism\u2019s direct contribution to CAREC member countries\u2019 gross \ndomestic product ranged from 10.1% (in Georgia) to 1.1% (in Uzbekistan). \n \n5.  Individually and collectively the CAREC countries have a wide range of natural and cultural \nresources to attract many segments of the international and domestic tourism markets. Many \nCAREC countries are making significant progress in developing and implementing national \ntourism strategies and policies, including in the area of visa liberalization. E-visa systems are now \noperational in seven CAREC countries;9 Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have granted visa-free \naccess to 45 countries starting from January 2017 and February 2019 respectively, and Pakistan \nhas launched a new e-visa scheme for 175 countries in March 2019. The Silk Road visa, a joint \ninitiative between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, is also underway. However, several factors still \nhinder tourism development in the region. \n \n(i)  Access to CAREC countries is still complex and time consuming because of limited air and \nland connectivity and cumbersome border control arrangements.10 \n(ii)  Tourism infrastructure and services are of inconsistent quality and do not follow international \nstandards. Intercity and public transport services are not regular, reliable, and inclusive; \nvisitor information centers and effective signage on tourist routes are lacking; and access to \nbasic utility services\u2014such as water supply and sanitation, waste management, and heating \nand cooling\u2014is limited, particularly in rural areas. In many CAREC countries, the regulatory \nframework for attracting tourism investments is also challenging. \n(iii)  Tourism planning, management, and promotion is ineffective because of (a) lack of national \nand regional coordination and dialogue between government agencies and private sector \noperators, (b) shortage of skilled hospitality workers and destination managers, and (c) low \ncapacity of tourism agencies to collect and analyze data and undertake market research. \nLocal  communities  have  little  involvement  in  tourism  planning  and  development, \nendangering preservation of the region\u2019s cultural and environmental heritage. Insufficient \nknowledge of the CAREC region\u2019s tourist assets among international consumers hampers \nefforts in regional tourism promotion and branding. \n \n6.  These barriers result in low volume of tourism flows and a weak image of the CAREC \nregion as a competitive tourism destination globally. Opportunities exist to overcome these \nshortcomings  through  collaboration  among  CAREC  countries.  The  CAREC  2030  strategy \nadvocates a regional approach to tourism development to help realize economies of scale from \ngreater specialization and more efficient use of resources. Tourists often do not recognize national \nboundaries  and  typically  combine  two  or  more  neighboring  countries  when  selecting  their \ndestinations.  Facilitating  travel  between  their  chosen  destination  countries  and  promoting \nmulticountry experiences can increase socioeconomic benefits for each country in the region. \n \n                                                \n8  World Travel and Tourism Council Data Gateway and UNWTO 2019.

In the People\u2019s Republic of China, tourist arrivals reached 63.5 million and the sector supported 82.4 \nmillion jobs in 2018. \n9  Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n10 Visa requirements and cost, passport control systems, and time for clearance. \n ", "3 \n7.  A scoping study conducted in 2018 identified the following potential areas for collaborative \ntourism  actions  (footnote  3):  (i)  simplification  of  visa  and  entry  procedures,  infrastructure \ndevelopment  on  cross-border  routes,  and  improvement  of  air  transport  connectivity;11  (ii) \ndevelopment  of  common  standards  and  certification  schemes  for  tourist  facilities;  (iii) \ndevelopment of tourism education and training courses with common curricula and qualifications; \n(iv) joint marketing and promotion activities under the Silk Road umbrella in collaboration with the \nWorld Tourism Organization Silk Road Programme; and (v) promotion of regulatory reforms and \ncreation of an enabling environment for tourism investments. The findings of the scoping study \nwere  discussed  at  the  first  CAREC  regional  tourism  consultation  workshop  in  Tashkent, \nUzbekistan, on 23\u201324 October 2018. During the workshop, tourism officials and private sector \nrepresentatives from the 11 CAREC countries emphasized the importance of establishing and \nmaintaining regular dialogue to advance tourism cooperation under CAREC. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: sustainable and more inclusive tourism \ndevelopment in the CAREC region (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: increased \ncooperation among CAREC countries to position the region as a globally attractive tourism \ndestination.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: CAREC tourism sector strategy 2030 developed. The TA will support the \ndevelopment of a tourism strategy, which will set out a vision and a road map toward 2030, in \nalignment  with  all  member  countries\u2019  tourism  priorities.  It  will  build  on  the  findings  and \nrecommendations of the tourism scoping study as well as past and ongoing trade and economic \ncorridor work in several CAREC countries,13 and other development partners\u2019 tourism initiatives.14 \nThe strategy will adopt a holistic approach by covering several areas: (i) travel facilitation and \nconnectivity; (ii) gender-inclusive human resources and skills development in hospitality; (iii) \ntourism infrastructure and services; (iv) tourism marketing and promotion; and (v) institutional \narrangements for tourism, including clearly defined roles for the public and private sectors.15 The \nstrategy will include a sound institutional coordination mechanism to effectively implement and \nmonitor tourism-related initiatives under CAREC. The TA will conduct demand analyses and asset \nmapping per country to identify priority subregional groupings and thematic-based clusters, (e.g. \nheritage tourism, adventure tourism, ecotourism, Islamic tourism, and urban tourism); and assess \ninfrastructure and urban services needs within the identified tourism clusters. The TA will consult \nand hold brainstorming sessions with regional, national, and provincial government agencies; the \nprivate sector; and local communities. \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2018. Aviation and the Role of CAREC: A Scoping Study. Manila. The recommendations of this scoping study \nwill be implemented to improve air transport connectivity. \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 This includes the joint tourism mountain cluster initiative currently being developed under the Almaty\u2013Bishkek \nEconomic Corridor; the trilateral economic corridor initiative among Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan; planned \ntourism-related interventions under the CAREC Integrated Trade Agenda 2030; and ongoing and planned ADB \ntourism projects in Georgia, Mongolia, and Tajikistan. \n14 This includes the European Union\u2019s Silk Roads Heritage Corridors project being implemented by the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). \n15 Cross-cutting themes will be mainstreamed across all strategy components, such as (i) gender equality, including \nimproving the readiness of women to access the benefits of tourism in the region; (ii) environmental and social \nsustainability, including assessing potential negative impacts resulting from \u201covertourism\u201d and proposed mitigation \nmeasures; and (iii) the use of information and communication technologies. A gender-inclusive strategy will take into \naccount social and gender issues relevant to tourism and will focus on bringing benefits (in terms of jobs, livelihoods, \nand safety) to the region for women, men, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. \n ", "4 \n \n10.  Output  2:  Regional  tourism  investment  framework  for  2021\u20132025  prepared.  A \nregional investment framework will complement the CAREC tourism sector strategy, with specific \nprojects to be implemented from 2021 to 2025 in all CAREC countries. It will comprise hard and \nsoft infrastructure interventions in the areas covered by the strategy. Project profiles will be \ndeveloped, including rationale; scope of the project; implementation period; indicative budget; and \npotential financing options, including public\u2013private partnerships. Special attention will be given \nto secondary cities along multicountry tourism circuits, economic corridors, high-demand tourism \nareas identified by the demand analyses, and gender-inclusive interventions. \n \n11.  Output 3: Institutional capacity of tourism authorities and exchange of information \nenhanced. The TA will support conducting workshops and training activities to enhance the \ncapacity of governments for tourism planning and policy making, including improving their ability \nto collect and analyze tourism statistics, undertake market research, and enhance tourism \nbranding and promotion. It will promote knowledge and experience sharing through twinning \narrangements, peer-to-peer learning events, study tours, and forums to foster public\u2013private \ndialogue. The TA will also develop a CAREC tourism virtual portal linked to the CAREC website \nto consolidate and disseminate tourism-related information, and will identify sustainable options \nfor maintaining and updating the web portal beyond the TA implementation period.16 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.0 million, of which (i) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6), and (ii) $1.5 million will be financed \non a grant basis by the United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity under the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.17 \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. The Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision and the Urban Development and Water Division of the Central and West Asia Department \nwill jointly implement the TA. They will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize \nconsultation workshops and seminars; and monitor TA implementation in close coordination with \nthe East Asia Department, resident missions, and other relevant operations and knowledge \ndepartments. The TA will be implemented from July 2019 to December 2021. \n \n14.  Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions. ADB will recruit a consulting firm using the fixed budget selection method for \nthe formulation of the CAREC tourism strategy 2030; the preparation of the regional investment \nframework 2021\u20132025; and the development of a CAREC tourism portal. In addition, ADB will \nengage up to 6 person-months of international and up to 10 person-months of national consultant \ninputs for capacity building and training events, and outreach activities. ADB will monitor and \n                                                \n16 The tourism portal will provide a single entry point to tourism-related information and services for tourists interested \nin visiting several CAREC countries. The specific content and services provided through this platform will be decided \nin close consultation with public and private stakeholders in CAREC countries. \n17 The TA will contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation targets through project concepts with high climate \nchange impact (e.g., ecotourism projects); and inclusion of environmental sustainability as a key cross-cutting theme \nof the strategy, including measures to mitigate potential negative environmental impacts from over-tourism. Hence, \nthe indicative contribution to adaptation and mitigation targets ($0.65 million) is equivalent to the cost estimated for \noutput 2 (project concepts produced under the regional investment framework). \n ", "5 \nevaluate the TA based on the implementation of activities and satisfactory delivery of outputs \nfollowing the agreed time line and budget.18 \n \n15.
