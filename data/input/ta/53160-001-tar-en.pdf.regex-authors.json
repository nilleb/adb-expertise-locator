INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and technical assistance (TA) will support the mandate of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to promote regional cooperation and integration (RCI) by updating and \nimproving ADB\u2019s Asia\u2013Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index (ARCII). The TA also \naims to use the ARCII to (i) provide evidence-based, in-depth analysis of the impact of RCI on \nsustainable development; and (ii) promote its use by ADB developing member countries (DMCs) \nand at ADB for RCI-related policy and investment planning.1 \n \n2.  Fostering RCI is one of the seven operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which \naims to achieve a more prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific.2 \nThe Operational Plan for RCI, 2016\u20132020 prioritizes the delivery of a sizable high-quality RCI \nportfolio to benefit DMCs and underpin ADB\u2019s acknowledged RCI leadership role in the region.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  RCI is a process by which national economies become more connected regionally. RCI \nnarrows development gaps between DMCs and plays a pivotal role in accelerating economic \ngrowth  within  DMCs,  reducing  poverty,  increasing  productivity  and  employment,  and \nstrengthening  institutions.  Deeper  regional  integration  expands  markets,  helps  maximize \nresource allocation efficiencies, and boosts productivity. It can also generate noneconomic \nbenefits, such as greater security and political stability.4 RCI has a commendable record in \ndevelopment strategies across the world, and the United Nations (UN) recognizes its importance \nin supporting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \n \n4.  RCI has made significant progress in Asia and the Pacific, driven by growing trade and \ninvestment networks linked to global supply chains. As more economies have entered into free \ntrade agreements, trade and investment liberalization has accelerated. However, RCI in Asia and \nthe Pacific has been bottom\u2013up and market-driven, and it has often lacked strong institutions and \ngovernance.5 Regional  organizations  and  multilateral  development  banks  have  introduced \nseveral initiatives to develop and strengthen regional institutions and accelerate RCI. \n \n5.  To properly monitor and evaluate the progress of RCI and ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for RCI, \n2016\u20132020, quantifiable measures and indicators of RCI are needed. To support this objective, \nADB\u2019s Asian Economic Integration Report 2017 unveiled the ARCII (footnote 4). The ARCII aims \nto assess the extent of each economy\u2019s integration into the region, identify strengths and \nweaknesses  among  multiple  RCI  drivers,  and  track  progress.  It  combines  26  indicators \ncategorized into six RCI dimensions: (i) trade and investment, (ii) money and finance, (iii) regional \nvalue chains, (iv) infrastructure and connectivity, (v) movement of people, and (vi) institutional \nand social integration.6 To improve the ARCII\u2019s ability to track progress and identify the main \ndrivers of regional integration, ADB undertook a time series analysis of the ARCII over 2006\u2013\n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 May 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Asia\u2013Pacific Regional Integration Index: Construction, Interpretation, \nand Comparison. Journal of Asian Economics. 54. pp. 22\u201338. \n \n ", "2 \n2016, which was presented in the Asian Economic Integration Report 2018.7 Analyses of the six \nconstituent subindexes showed that infrastructure and connectivity are the largest contributors to \nRCI, and the importance of trade and investment has been increasing. The report presented \nARCII data for each subregion and selected subregional programs in Asia and the Pacific. ADB \nalso used the panel ARCII data to investigate RCI as a development strategy. Empirical analysis \nshowed that RCI significantly boosts economic growth and poverty reduction.8 \n \n6.  While the ARCII is a significant step forward in RCI monitoring and evaluation, there is \nconsiderable room for improvement. First, lack of data limits the country coverage. Currently, the \noverall ARCII can be computed for only 23 of 48 economies in Asia and the Pacific.9 Second, the \n26 indicators and six dimensions may not fully capture the roles of RCI in achieving the aspirations \nof  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  and  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  Third,  the  ARCII  is  an \nincomplete measure of economic openness to the rest of the world. In addition, as a new index, \nit needs to gain credence. To this end, it is notable that UN agencies, including the Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific, have expressed interest in partnering with ADB to \nexpand and harmonize diverse indexes to provide internationally consistent measures of RCI. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Comprehensive, aggregated, and up-to-date \nmeasures of the progress of RCI in Asia and the Pacific available for RCI-related policy making \nand development projects. The TA will have the following outcome: Improved and updated ARCII \nestimates with expanded country coverage utilized in RCI-related research and referenced by \npolicy makers, researchers, the media, and the general public.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  To strengthen the ARCII as a tool for evaluating RCI progress, the TA will review and \nimprove the ARCII methodology and database in collaboration with international experts and UN \nagencies and other international organizations, provide support for ADB\u2019s RCI Thematic Group \nand RCI-related operations, and produce evidence-based research on RCI-related issues using \nthe ARCII. \n \n9.  Output 1: Asia\u2013Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index database and \nmethodology improved and maintained. The TA will improve the ARCII and its methodology \nby closing data gaps and evaluating other indicators for inclusion in the ARCII. The TA will \ncommission a study to review the existing ARCII methodology and identify RCI-related indicators \nthat could augment or replace existing ones. The TA team will coordinate with ADB\u2019s Strategy, \nPolicy and Partnerships Department (SPD) and Sustainable Development and Climate Change \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2018. Asian Economic Integration Report 2018. Manila. \n8  Cyn-Young Park, and Racquel Claveria. 2018. Does Regional Integration Matter for Inclusive Growth? Evidence \nfrom the Multidimensional Regional Integration Index. ADB Economics Working Paper Series. No. 559. Manila: ADB. \n9  The ARCII data cover all 48 ADB regional members. The 23 economies with data for all six dimensions are Australia; \nBangladesh; Cambodia; Georgia; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Japan; Kazakhstan; the Kyrgyz Republic; the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Mongolia; Nepal; New Zealand; Pakistan; the People's Republic of \nChina; the Philippines; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Thailand; and Viet Nam. The overall ARCII was \nnot estimated for Pacific DMCs as data for the money and finance dimension are not available. Subindexes for the \nfive other dimensions were computed using available data for at most 14 Pacific DMCs. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "3 \nDepartment (SDCC) to ensure that the new indicators are in line with the results framework of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 Operational Plan. To complement the ARCII, the TA will improve the global \nopenness index developed by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Division (ERCI) of ADB\u2019s \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department. The index is designed to measure \ncountries\u2019 degree of economic integration with the world. The TA team will consult with select \nDMCs\u2019 national statistical agencies, the national secretariats of subregional programs, ADB \nresident  missions  and  operations  departments,  and  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation Institute to explore proxy variables for the ARCII.11 The team will also collaborate \nwith  other  regional  and  international  organizations,  including  the  Economic  and  Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific, to develop and refine the ARCII estimates. If needed, the \nTA will purchase databases from third-party providers. \n \n10.  The TA will update annually the ARCII estimates and benchmark them against indexes \nfor comparable regions such as Africa, the European Union, and Latin America. To increase the \nexposure of the ARCII database, updated indexes will be published in ADB\u2019s annual Asian \nEconomic Integration Report and on ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) website.12 \nTo enlarge the user base, the TA will coordinate with the ARIC website team to improve the ARCII \ndatabase\u2019s online interface and analytical tools. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Support  for  ADB  regional  cooperation  and  integration  operations \nprovided. The TA will use the ARCII estimates to provide knowledge support catering to ADB\u2019s \nRCI operations and subregional cooperation programs, such as the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Program, the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program, \nand the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program. The TA team will coordinate \nclosely with ADB\u2019s operations departments, the RCI Thematic Group secretariat in SDCC, and \nSPD to test the applicability of the ARCII in monitoring RCI progress for reporting in ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 corporate results framework. The TA will also provide knowledge support and \nundertake capacity-building activities for research institutes and ADB\u2019s operations departments \nto encourage adoption of the ARCII in ADB-supported subregional initiatives. The TA team will \nproduce reports and analyses of these indexes in collaboration with relevant ADB departments \nand units. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Analytical  research  on  regional  cooperation  and  integration  as  a \ndevelopment strategy using Asia\u2013Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index \nproduced and disseminated. To provide solid empirical and analytical research on RCI, the TA \nwill commission three research papers using the ARCII data. ERCI will select research topics \nbased on consultation with DMC policy makers and ADB operations departments, including those \nleading the ADB-initiated subregional programs. The papers may be published as separate policy \nbriefs or working papers and will serve as inputs to an ARCII report on the improved estimates. \nADB will launch the ARCII report in coordination with a reputable regional research institute or \ninternational organization. The TA team will organize seminars to promote the ARCII, disseminate \nresearch findings, and gather comments to help refine and improve the study. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n11 The TA team may conduct surveys to gather data from government agencies, including national statistical offices. \n12 ADB.

ADB will administer the TA. ERCI will be responsible for TA administration and supervision, \nmanagement of consultants, procurement, and achieving the desired outputs. To deliver the TA \noutputs, the TA team will implement a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, coordinating with SPD, SDCC, the \nRCI Thematic Group, regional departments, and subregional programs to improve the ARCII \nmethodology and database and ensure that the ARCII estimates and related research are utilized \nfor ADB\u2019s RCI-related operations and to support policy making in the region. \n \n15.

ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.13 ADB will commission the international consultants to conduct research on the \nfurther improvement of the ARCII methodology and the estimation of a globalization openness \nindex; and prepare research papers utilizing ARCII estimates on topics or areas identified in \nconsultation with relevant ADB departments and units. National consultants will include an RCI \nindex specialist who will lead the estimation of the ARCII, implement improvements on the \nmethodology, and oversee and coordinate the preparation and publication of research papers \nand reports. Other national consultants include project analysts and an event organizer. ADB will \nengage distinguished international experts, which could include ADB staff, as resource persons \nto present or facilitate discussions at seminars and other events.

ADB will consider \nlump-sum payments, output-based contracts, and framework contracts for individual consulting services. Firm \nselection may also be considered depending on the specific research topics to be decided in consultation with ADB\u2019s \nregional and knowledge departments and subregional programs. \n \n ", "5 \nwill provide more benefits to ADB than engaging a firm because the experience and qualifications \nof  the  individual  consultants  who  will  undertake  the  ARCII  research  are  of  paramount \nimportance.14 It would also be difficult to find a firm that specializes in the wide range of RCI-\nrelated areas that the ARCII database and research will cover. \n \n17.  A team of ERCI staff comprising two international staff members (one acting as the project \nleader and the other as alternate project leader), one national officer, one operations coordinator, \nand one operations assistant will oversee and manage TA implementation. \n \n18.  Printed external publications. ADB will disseminate the ARCII report and research \npapers electronically, using digital platforms, especially ADB\u2019s official website, the ARIC website, \nblogs, infographics, and other online knowledge-sharing sites. ADB will print 200\u2013300 copies of \nthe ARCII report highlights as awareness-raising material for distribution during the report launch. \nADB departments and units will provide printed copies of the full report on demand to policy \nmakers and other audiences.  \n \n19.
