", "I.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare the second agriculture area development project (SAADP) \nto increase agricultural productivity and profitability in the southern regions of Batken, Jalal \nAbad, and Osh, similar to the ongoing Agriculture Area Development Project (AADP) in the Chui \noblast (region). The TA is included in the Government\u2019s program and ADB\u2019s country assistance \nstrategy and program for 2004. A Fact-Finding Mission visited the Kyrgyz Republic in August \n2004 to formulate the TA with the Government. The TA1 framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s current assistance to the agriculture sector includes AADP in Chui, and the \nassociated  TA,  Institutional  Strengthening  in  Planning  and  Management  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment.2 AADP was approved in December 1999, began implementation in June 2001, \nand is scheduled for completion in December 2007. The goal is to increase the incomes of \nfarmers in Chui. The immediate project objective is to increase farm productivity and profitability \nin  selected  areas.  The  Project  was  designed  to  address  constraints  in  farm  restructuring, \ndrainage and irrigation, input supply, machinery hire services, marketing, and finance. The aim \nwas to integrate ongoing and planned activities to maximize the impact of the Project and other \ndevelopment activities. The approach was to focus on the key constraints at the farm level and \nto coordinate the ongoing and planned investment projects, and related linkages between public \nsector investment and private sector initiatives to enhance their impact on farm productivity and \nprofitability.  There  are  four  components:  (i)  farm  development,  (ii) drainage  and  irrigation \nrehabilitation, (iii) development of private sector marketing and input supply services, and (iv) \nproject management.  \n \n3.  AADP is actively working with other projects and agencies including the World Bank On-\nFarm Irrigation Project for water user association development; three projects funded by United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development:  Legal  Infrastructure  for  a  Market  Economy, \nKyrgyz Land Reform Project, and Legal Assistance to Rural Citizens Project (with Helvetas) to \naddress  land  reform  issues;  and  the  Rural  Advisory  Service  and  Center  for  Training  and \nConsultancy for farmer training needs assessment and follow-up training and demonstrations. \n \n4.  Despite  the  initial  delays  in  loan  start-up  (18  months)  and  some  problems  in \nimplementation  (slow  implementation  progress,  procurement  delays,  limited  integration  of \nactivities  across  components  initially,  and  land  title  issues),  the  Project  is  progressing \nsatisfactorily. Seventeen farms, comprising 40,050 hectares (ha) of a targeted 55,000 ha, are \nunder various stages of farm development planning, and design and rehabilitation of irrigation \nsystems. Marketing and enterprise development has resulted in the establishment of about 40 \nfarmers groups in vegetables and milk, and business plans and technical assistance provided to \n30 agribusiness enterprises. Over 1,900 loans, amounting to about $3.2 million of a $10 million \ncredit  line,  have  been  provided  through  the  Kyrgyz  Agriculture  Finance  Corporation.  The \nMinistry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry (MAWRPI) considers the \nconcept and approach of AADP appropriate to address the needs of agricultural development. \nThe  concept  provides  an  alternative  to  the  broader  nationwide  projects  and  smaller  pilot \nactivities of most other aid agencies. The area focus of AADP has enabled a concentration of \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 April 2004. \n2\n ADB. 1999.

", "2  \nthe required activities from AADP and several aid projects to provide more holistic development \nsupport. MAWRPI has requested that AADP be adapted for implementation in Batken, Jalal \nAbad, and Osh, where the farm structure, opportunities, productivity, and profitability differ from \nthose in Chui. \n \n5.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  identified  the  following  lessons.  To  improve  project \nprocessing, more time is needed for effective participation and review and discussion of reports \nto increase the government agencies' and stakeholders' understanding and sense of ownership \nof  the  Project. Government participation at all levels should be strengthened. Lessons for \ndesign and implementation follow: (i) implementation arrangements should be specific and \ndetailed to facilitate start-up and implementation; (ii) activities across project components should \nbe better sequenced and integrated to ensure equal priority to farm and enterprise development \nactivities, and drainage and irrigation rehabilitation; (iii) farm selection should have a \"cluster\" \napproach to facilitate economies of scale and the development and expansion of agribusiness \nservices; (iv) a more diligent assessment of the financial, management, and skills capacity of \nexecuting,  implementing,  and  related  agencies  is  required  to  ensure  strong  management, \nfinancial,  and  procurement  capacity;  (v)  given  the  increasing  demand  for  design  and \nconstruction activities, a thorough assessment of the capacity of the industry is essential. The \nassessment should include a review of the cost base for tenders to reflect appropriate pricing \nand financial position of design and construction companies; (vi) the organizational structure \nshould be streamlined to facilitate decision making and implementation; (vii) ADB\u2019s procedures \nshould be more clearly detailed and streamlined; (viii) terms of reference for both international \nand domestic consultants should be more specific and task oriented; and (ix) an effective \nmonitoring and evaluation system should be established early in project implementation. \n  \n6.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  undertaken  a  comprehensive  reform  program  since \nindependence in 1992. The reforms have helped the economy to recover. The agriculture sector \nhas grown consistently since 1996 with an average annual growth rate of about 7.4% (1996\u2013\n2002) compared with 4.7% for the economy as a whole. The sector accounts for 35% of the \ngross domestic product, employs about 52% of the total workforce, and accounts for about 11% \nof exports (2002). \n \n7.  About 66% of the country\u2019s population live in the rural areas and depend on agriculture \nfor their livelihood. In 2003, 40.8% of the population were living in absolute poverty, a decline \nfrom 44.4% in 2002. Nutrition-based poverty declined from 17.8% in 2000 to 9.4% in 2003. \nPoverty  incidence  in  rural  areas  declined  over  1998\u20132003  largely  due  to  the  improved \nperformance of the agriculture sector and higher average real wages. However, rural poverty \ncontinues to be significantly higher than urban poverty\u2014with about three quarters of the poor \npeople  living  in  rural  areas\u2014because  of  the  transition  process  and  the  limited  economic \nopportunities in rural areas. There are significant regional differences in poverty and a large part \nof the population live very close to the margin between poor and non-poor, thus creating a \nsignificant degree (about 39% in 2001) of transient poverty. \n \n8.  The crop, livestock, and agro-industrial subsectors continue to experience substantial \nadjustments. Agriculture continues to underperform, as many of the farms and agro-processing \nfacilities are not operating efficiently and are not profitable, and some are not financially viable. \nAmong the main factors inhibiting more effective agriculture growth and development are the \nfollowing: (i) farm size, ownership structure, and farm management practices significantly differ ", "  3\nacross the regions;3 (ii) farm productivity is generally low because of limited use of fertilizers and \nquality  seeds,  increasing  land  degradation  (declining  soil  fertility,  increasing  salinity, \nwaterlogging,  etc.),  poor  farming  practices  (often  due  to  the  small  size  of  farms  and \ninexperience of some farmers), limited access to credit, limited access to machinery services, \nirrigation systems that require rehabilitation, inadequate or unaffordable extension services, and \ninadequate  marketing  and  processing  facilities;  (iii)  the  agricultural  research  system  and \nstatistical information services have not changed significantly to support agriculture in a market-\noriented economy; (iv) the vocational education system has not changed and does not offer the \nformal  and  informal  training  needed  by  farmers,  many  of  whom  have    limited  farming \nexperience; and (v) the privatization and transition process has dismantled the former support \nservices to agriculture. While a new system of services, based on private ownership and market \nprinciples, is emerging it has not adequately kept pace with the changing structure, ownership, \nand management of farms; and new institutions are slow to develop in the absence of an \nenabling business environment, available finance, farm profitability, and effective demand for \ninputs and services. With the prevailing situation, most farmers and enterprises continue to \nconduct transactions on a barter basis. \n \n9.  Assistance to agriculture and related areas is diverse in size, focus and scope, and \ngeographical location. A large number of aid-supported activities are focused in the southern \nregions. Projects also range from small pilot activities in selected districts to large nationwide \nprograms. These programs address all constraints, but to varying degrees and with varying \nlevels of coordination.  \n \n10.  The proposed SAADP will adapt the concept, approach, and lessons learned from AADP \nto provide a concentrated and coordinated focus on key constraints at local and farm level to \nbring together and enhance the impact of existing project activities, bridge the remaining gaps, \nand actively involve the private sector in providing key services. The TA will take a regional \napproach, where appropriate, to identify the key constraints from input supply to marketing and \nprocessing, identify and review current government and aid-funded activities, assess the needs, \nand formulate a project that addresses the needs and develops linkages with existing activities \nto enhance overall impact. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The TA will help the Government design an investment project to address constraints to \nagricultural productivity and profitability in the Batken, Jalal Abad, and Osh regions in the \nsouthern part of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n12.  The TA will be divided into two phases. The key output in phase 1 (3 months) will be an \nanalysis of the growth and development of agriculture in each region; an outline of the key \nissues,  constraints,  and  opportunities;  the  geographical  focus,  broad  scope,  and  potential \nlinkages with existing government, private sector institutions, and aid-funded activities identified; \nand alternative design approaches identified and initially assessed. Phase 2 will produce a \ndetailed  feasibility  study  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  reference,  including  possible \ncofinancing packages.  \n                                                 \n3\n  For example, 42% of farms are located in Jalal Abad and Osh and have an average size of 0.5 ha, compared with \n19% of farms located in the north with an average size of 1.4 ha. However, 85% of arable land is irrigated, with the \nmajority (60%) in the north, and 27% in Batken, Jalal Abad, and Osh. ", "4  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented with a participatory approach from the national to the village \nlevel and will involve the private sector (farmers, agribusiness enterprises, etc.), civil society, \nand  aid-funded  projects.  The  participatory  approach  will  be  implemented  through  the  TA \nsteering  committee,  regional  level  working  groups,  stakeholder  workshops,  focus  group \ninterviews, and the social analysis survey in each region.  \n \n14.  The activities in phase 1 will be (i) an assessment of progress and lessons learned in \nAADP; (ii) an update on the status of agriculture growth and development in each region; (iii) \nidentification  of  the  key  issues,  constraints,  and  opportunities  with  respect  to  furthering \nagricultural growth and development; (iv) a mapping of existing and planned aid-supported \nactivities against constraints and opportunities; (v) institutional and financial analyses of regional \nadministration and other levels of Government and other potential agencies as necessary; (vi) \nidentification  of  potential  links  with  private  sector  and  government  agencies;  (vii)  initial \nassessment of alternative design approaches for further assessment in phase 2; and (viii) \nagreement with the Government on the geographical focus and scope of the proposed project. \nPhase 2 (6 months) will prepare a detailed feasibility study that will include key investment \nactivities, institutional development activities, and clearly identified links to existing or planned \ninvestment activities of the Government, private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and aid \npartners. Special efforts will be made to ensure that implementation capacity exists among the \nrelevant agencies, particularly at local government level, for efficient and effective management \nof the SAADP. \n \n15.  The goal of the SAADP will be to increase the production and incomes of farmers in \nthree regions: Batken, Jalal Abad, and Osh. The immediate objective (purpose) is to increase \nthe productivity and profitability of farms and enterprises. \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.0 million equivalent, comprising $608,400 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $391,600  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance \n$800,000 equivalent consisting of the entire foreign exchange cost and $191,600 equivalent in \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $200,000 equivalent to cover the \nlocal  currency  cost  of  office  accommodation,  data  compilation,  logistical  support,  and \ncounterpart staff. These costs are in kind. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. The \nSAADP  is  expected  to  obtain  a  loan  of  up  to  $30  million  equivalent  over  six  years.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  MAWRPI will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  A project working group is proposed \nto be chaired by MAWRPI, with representatives from Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy \nand Trade, other relevant government agencies, the regional governments, and relevant aid \nagencies.  \n \n18.  The TA will be undertaken over 9 months in two phases and is expected to begin in \nDecember 2004 and be completed in September 2005.  About 73 person-months  of  consulting  ", "  5\nservices  (26  international and 47 domestic) will be required. The international experts will \ninclude  a  team  leader-economist-planner,  institutional  development  specialist,  agriculture \neconomist, rural engineer, environmentalist, sociologist, vocational education specialist, and \nothers  as  needed.  The  domestic  experts  will  include  an  economist-deputy  team  leader, \ninstitutional specialist, irrigation systems specialist, rural sociologist, agribusiness specialist, \nenvironmental  specialist-sustainable  land  management,  agriculture-livestock  specialist,  and \nothers as needed. Detailed terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The services of a firm will be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. A simplified technical \nproposal using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure will be adopted for recruiting the \nconsulting  firm.  The  consultants  will  procure  computer  equipment  in  accordance  with \narrangements  acceptable  to  ADB.  An  initial  poverty  and  social  impact  assessment  of  the \nproposed project is in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  Several participatory workshops will be held to strengthen the participatory approach. In \neach region, workshops will be held at the start of phase 1 to review the agriculture situation, \nassess alternative design approaches, and discuss the findings and recommendations of the \nconsultants. The project working group at the national level will meet at the start of phase 1 to \nguide the consultants, and at the end to agree on the findings and recommendations and \nproposed activities for phase 2. In phase 2, workshops at the regional level will continue while \nproject design is ongoing. More intensive workshops and focus groups meetings will be held \nwith districts and villages in the selected focus areas and with farmers, associations, private \nsector, and aid-financed projects to ensure a sense of ownership, and agreement to the detailed \ndesign and implementation arrangements. \n \n20.  The consultants will submit an inception, phase 1, interim, draft final, and final reports. \nTripartite  review  meetings  to  be  held  at  appropriate  times  will  discuss  the  findings  and \nrecommendations.  \n \n21.  The Government will provide (i) administrative assistance to the consultants in obtaining \nvisas, customs clearances, and other permits to perform their tasks in relation to the terms of \nreference; (ii) all documents and information available to agencies within the government that \nwill facilitate the work of the consultants; (iii) adequate office space for all consultants, with \nappropriate  furniture;  (iv)  local  communications  facilities  and  direct  access  to  international \ncommunication  facilities  (the  cost  of  international  communications  will  be  borne  by  the \nconsultants); and (v) counterpart staff to work with the consultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for preparing the Second Agriculture Area Development \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

In phase 1, a comprehensive review \nof the state of agriculture development in the oblast (region) will be made to identify major \nissues,  constraints,  and  opportunities  for  further  growth  and  development  of  agriculture. \nInstitutional and financial analyses of the region's administration and, where necessary, of \ndistricts,  villages,  farmer  organizations,  and  other  relevant  agencies  will  be  carried  out  to \ndetermine  their  capacity  and  the  strategic  needs  for  assistance.  Ongoing  and  planned \ndevelopment activities by Government, private sector, and funding agencies will be reviewed. \nAlternative approaches to addressing issues, constraints, and opportunities will be assessed. In \nphase  2,  the  project  will  be  designed,  taking  account  of  the  findings  in  phase  1,  the \nreassessment of the alternative approaches identified, and relevant policy, technical, economic, \nfinancial, social, environmental, and institutional aspects.  \n \nA.  Phase 1: Review of the Regions \n \n2.  The  review  of  the  regions  can  be  based  largely  on  existing  reports  and  project \ndocuments.1 Some farm-level rapid rural appraisal will be required.  \n \n  1.  Regional Growth and Development \n \n3.  The analysis of the overall growth and development of Batken, Jalal Abad, and Osh will \ncover the following:  \n \n(i)  growth and development of each region based on available national and regional \nstatistics; \n(ii)  progress of agricultural reforms in the region, and identification of any major \nconstraints to effective implementation and additional reforms to facilitate the \ntransition to a market-based agriculture sector; \n(iii)  achievements  of  regional  development  efforts  undertaken  by  the  local \ngovernment, private sector, and funding agencies; and \n(iv)  the  socioeconomic  situation  and  identification  of  major  economic  and  social \nissues  affecting  the  rural  population,  with  particular  attention  to  women  and \nvulnerable  groups,  and  the  effects  of  farm  restructuring,  reduction  of  social \nservices, and access to resources (including land) and infrastructure. \n \n2.  Assessment of Agriculture  \n \n4.  The assessment of development in agriculture will address the following aspects: \n \n(i)  Ownership  and  structure  of  farms  in  the  region  and  factors  influencing  the \nsuccess  of  private  farming.  Constraints  that  inhibit  the  improvement  of  farm \nproductivity and profitability will be identified using rapid rural appraisal to identify \nfarm  types,  farm  size,  ownership,  land,  labor  and  capital  availability,  output, \nproductivity,  and  net  income  disaggregated  by  farm  enterprise  and  where \napplicable, by gender. The Agricultural Census of 2002 will provide essential \nbase data. \n                                                 \n1\n Including broad-based reports on the agriculture sector undertaken by Government and funding agencies, and \nproject reports specific to or including each region. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(ii)  The  market  potential  for  the  region,  the  competitiveness  of  the  products \nproduced,  the  potential  for  increased  competitiveness,  and  constraints  to \nachieving  this  competitiveness.  A  comparative  advantage  analysis  of  the \nselected project area will be included. \n(iii)  Availability and farmers' access to input supplies, technology, finance, markets \nand marketing facilities and channels, extension and research, and transport and \ndistribution networks. Major constraints and opportunities will be identified. \n \n3.  Infrastructure  \n \n5.  The assessment of infrastructure will focus on \n \n(i)  the condition of off-farm and on-farm drainage and irrigation infrastructure, and \nresponsibilities for and financing of operation and maintenance; and \n(ii)  the condition of rural roads and the main constraints to effective repair and \nmaintenance. \n \n  4.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic: \n \nThe Government\u2019s Comprehensive Development Program and National Poverty Reduction Strategy recognize the \nimportance of agriculture and rural development as a key to poverty reduction. Agriculture development is to be \naddressed through several means: (i) development of the agro-industrial complex by reviving industrial agricultural \nproduction aimed at food security and sustainable development of the processing sector; (ii) rational use of natural \nresources by improving the efficiency of water resource use, promoting the rational use of land resources, and \npreserving  and  broadening  the  area  of  forest  cover  and  specifically  protected  territories;  and  (iii)  balanced \ndevelopment of the regions by stimulating local self-government. \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic has undertaken a comprehensive reform program since independence in 1992. Since 1996, \nthese reforms have helped the economy to recover. The agriculture sector has grown consistently since 1996 with an \naverage annual growth rate of about 7.4% (1996\u20132002) compared with 4.7% for the economy as a whole. The sector \naccounts for 35% of gross domestic product, employs about 52% of the total workforce, and accounts for about 11% of \nexports (2002).  \n \nAbout 66% of the country\u2019s population live in the rural areas and are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. In \n2002, 44% of the population were living in absolute poverty and 13.8% in extreme poverty. Poverty incidence in tge \nrural areas declined at an average rate of 8% per year over 1998\u20132001 largely due to the improved performance of the \nagriculture sector. Thus, agriculture has and will continue to play a significant part in further reducing the level of \npoverty. \n \nRural poverty continues to be significantly higher than urban poverty, with about 75% of the poor (2001) living in rural \nareas. There are significant regional differences in poverty: Naryn oblast (region) has the highest incidence followed by \nTalas; the three southern regions of Batken, Jalal-Abad, and Osh; and the northern region of Issyk-Kul. The least poor \narea is the Chui region. Another important observation is that most of the population live very close to the margin \nbetween poor and non-poor, thus creating a significant degree (about 39% in 2001) of transient poverty. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe TA will require poverty analysis that is disaggregated by region and by gender. The three southern regions\u2014 \nBatken, Jalal Abad, and Osh\u2014have relatively high levels of poverty, given the higher density of population and \nrelatively smaller farm size. The technical assistance (TA) will look at the incidence of poverty using existing data \nsources and supplementing it through a social survey of potential beneficiaries. Both income and nonincome poverty \nindices will be determined. The analysis will be carried out following the Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis and \nHandbook for Integrating Poverty Impact in Economic Analysis of Projects. Particular attention will be given to profiling \nthe beneficiaries, with gender-disaggregated demographic, economic, and social data, where possible, plus the \nincidence of poverty, vulnerable groups, ability and willingness to pay for cost recovery, and any adverse impacts \nanticipated from the project.  \n \n \n \nC.

Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nAs  part  of  the  social  assessment,  the  consultant  will  undertake  a  gender-disaggregated  analysis  of  potential \nbeneficiaries. In addition, activities to facilitate women\u2019s more active participation in the project will be identified and \nincorporated into the project design. \n \nIn addition to the project preparatory TA, a gender specialist is being funded by the Gender and Development Fund to \nanalyze the ongoing Agriculture Area Development Project (AADP). The objective is to assess the current level of \nwomen's participation in the activities of AADP and the benefits accruing to them. The success indicators will first be a \nreport on the findings and recommendations for enhancing women's participation in the Project and how the approach \nin the proposed project can be improved.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?
