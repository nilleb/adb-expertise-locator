INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support countries in the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) in transforming the GMS Program into a more effective regional \ncooperation platform that adds value to member countries\u2019 national development strategies and \nbenefits the local populations of member countries.1 The TA is aligned with the GMS Economic \nCooperation  Program  Strategic  Framework,  2012\u20132022;  and  ADB\u2019s  Operational  Plan  for \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration,  2016\u20132020. 2 GMS  countries  strongly  support  the \nproposed outputs and activities. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since 1992, ADB has provided financial support for high-priority subregional projects of \nthe GMS Program in a wide range of sectors.3 The ADB-supported projects have delivered \nconcrete  outputs.  From  1992  to  2016,  about  3,000  kilometers  of  power  transmission  and \ndistribution lines were constructed and more than 10,000 kilometers of expressways and national \nroads of GMS corridors were built.4 The GMS Program will celebrate its 25th year Anniversary in \n2017 at a time when Asia is going through sweeping transformations that have altered its \neconomic landscape in fundamental ways. \n \n3.  The GMS, however, still faces challenges. There are missing infrastructure links in GMS \neconomic corridors, especially in Myanmar. The feeder road network connecting the production \nand trade hubs among GMS countries is not yet fully developed. Transport and trade facilitation \nmeasures have not been fully implemented, including the implementation of the GMS Cross-\nBorder Transport Facilitation Agreement. Inequality within economies and across countries are \ngrowing. Climate change and the spread of contagious diseases present numerous obstacles to \ninclusive growth and sustainable development. Interregional linkages between the GMS and other \nsubregions are weak. Within this context, GMS countries have requested ADB  to continue to \nsupport the GMS Program. \n \n4.  The GMS strategic framework midterm review reaffirmed the strong ownership and \ncommitment of the member countries in the GMS Program5. It identified the following challenges \nthat need to be addressed to improve the effectiveness of the program: (i) weak coordination and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 12 September 2017. The GMS is \nmade up of Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China (specifically Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang \nAutonomous Region), the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  The GMS secretariat presented the TA concept paper at the GMS Senior Officials\u2019 meeting on 7 July 2017 in Bangkok. \nGMS senior officials are represented by GMS national coordinators. The mandate of GMS Senior Officials\u2019 meetings \nis to provide guidance on GMS cooperation and support the GMS ministers and leaders in approving important \npolicies for cooperation. ADB. 2011. The Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program Strategic \nFramework, 2012\u20132022. Manila; ADB. ADB. 2016. Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u2013\n2020: Promoting Connectivity, Competitiveness, Regional Public Goods, and Collective Action for Asia and the \nPacific. Manila. \n3  As of the end of 2016, ADB had extended loans totaling $7.3 billion for 84 investment projects, with a total project \ncost of about $19.1 billion. The GMS governments provided $4.9 billion and the development partners provided $6.9 \nbillion. \n4  The achievements of the previous TA project that supported the GMS Program are included in the \u201cAchievements of \nTA 7561-REG: Strengthening the Coordination of the GMS Program (2010-2017)\u201d accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 3. \n5  ADB. Forthcoming. Ha Noi Action Plan 2018-2022. Manila. \n ", "2 \ndecision-making mechanisms; (ii) inadequate mechanisms for project identification, resource \nmobilization, and results monitoring; and (iii) weak knowledge-based strategic planning.6  \n \n5.  Weak coordination and decision-making mechanisms. High staff turnover in GMS \nnational secretariats has resulted in low institutional memory and inexperience of staff. At the \nsubregional  level,  the  performance  of  working  groups  and  forums  (WGFs)  varies.  More \nimportantly, not all GMS WGFs have well-defined work plans and terms of reference.7 The GMS \nSummit and the GMS Ministerial Conference are still ceremonial rather than strategic. GMS \nministers, development partners, and the private sector need to have more productive and \ndynamic interactions. \n \n6.  Inadequate  mechanisms  for  project  identification,  resource  mobilization,  and \nresults  monitoring.  The  GMS  Regional  Investment  Framework  (RIF)  2013-2022  is  a \ncommendable effort by the GMS countries to develop a viable regional project pipeline.8 The RIF \noperationalizes the strategic priorities of the GMS Program under the GMS Strategic Framework, \n2012\u20132022. However, the RIF does not fully reflect the GMS countries\u2019 actual demand for project \nsupport. The subregional programming set forth in the RIF is not well aligned with individual \ncountries\u2019 programming. Despite a long list of projects, there is a lack of bankable projects in the \nRIF. \n  \n7.  The GMS  Program  has  also  been  challenged by  its  inability  to  mobilize  resources \ncommensurate with rising demand. The lack of bankable projects and weak marketing of the \nproject pipeline have limited the interest of development partners and the private sector in \ninvesting in the program. The program\u2019s monitoring and evaluation mechanism does not track the \nimplementation progress, outcomes, and outputs of the GMS initiatives and projects. \n \n8.  Weak knowledge-based strategic planning. Strategic planning plays a critical role in \nthe GMS Program given the increasingly complex issues that the program must deal with. \nEffective strategic planning depends on the quality of the analytical work, which should support (i) \nthe decision-making processes, (ii) the formulation of sector strategies, and (iii) the identification \nof potential subregional projects.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: regional cooperation and integration in the \nGMS sustained. The TA will have the following outcome: implementation of the GMS Program is \nmore effective. \n                                                \n6 A  midterm  review  of  the  GMS  Strategic  Framework  2012-2022  was  recently  completed.  The  findings  and \nrecommendations of the midterm review have served as basis of the action program for the remaining five years of \nimplementation of the GMS Strategic Framework (dubbed as the \u201cHa Noi Action Plan 2018-2022\u201d). The framework \nand forward directions of the action program were endorsed at the 22nd GMS Ministerial Conference last 20 \nSeptember 2017. The Ha Noi Action Plan will be finalized for adoption at the 6th GMS Summit in March 2018.   \n7  Ideally, the WGFs should exercise four main functions: (i) knowledge platform for information sharing; (ii) regional \npolicy exchange and dialogue, and occasionally formulation of regional agreements; (iii) project identification and \nprogramming, which is critical to the alignment of the GMS Regional Investment Framework (RIF) with national \npriorities, and with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies and country operations business plans; and (iv) monitoring \nof project implementation and agreed regional policies. Almost all WGFs focus only on (i), and have not effectively \nexercised the other functions. \n8 ADB.  2013.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n10.  Output 1: Coordination and decision-making mechanisms strengthened. First, for \nGMS national secretariats, the TA will enhance the capacity of staff through (i) participation in \nshort-term training courses, or specific task-based assignments; and (ii) provision of national \nconsultants. Second, for WGFs, the TA will focus on (i) revising or preparing the work plans of \nsome sector working groups;9 and (ii) supporting the organization of some WGFs\u2019 meetings.10 \nThird, the TA will continue to support the organization of the GMS Summit, the Economic \nCorridors Forum, and the GMS Ministerial Conference. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Project  identification,  resource  mobilization,  and  results  monitoring \nmechanisms improved. The TA will support the updating of the RIF. The RIF will provide initial \ninformation to support project identification at the country level. Spatial planning will help prioritize \nprojects to be included in the RIF. The GMS central and national secretariats, and sector WGFs \nwill regularly review and update the revised RIF to maintain its relevance and responsiveness as \na planning tool for project identification, and in the alignment of regional and national programming. \nThe TA will also support enhancements to (i) the GMS project database to allow the monitoring \nof both project progress and results, and (ii) the GMS website to support project monitoring and \nsharing of information. The GMS central and national secretariats will continue to support the \norganization  of  the  governors\u2019  forums,  development  partners\u2019  meetings,  and  the  regional \ninvestment forum to promote project identification and resource mobilization.11   \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge-based strategic planning enhanced.12 The TA will support the \npreparation of (i) sector and/or country and regional assessments to inform the preparation of \nsector strategies, country partnership strategies, and country operations business plans; (ii) \npromotional materials to disseminate GMS achievements;13 (iii) GMS statistical handbooks; (iv) \ncorridor performance assessments; (v) thematic seminars that will contribute to more substantive \ndiscussions at the GMS Summit and Ministerial Conference; and (vi) studies that support the \nGovernors\u2019 Forum. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.0 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6) and $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.14 The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n9 The GMS Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022 identifies the following priority sectors: agriculture, energy, environment \n(natural resource management, flood, and drought control), human resource development, health, information and \ncommunication technology, urban development, tourism, and transport and trade facilitation.  \n10 The Transport and Communications Division, Urban Development and Water Division, and other sector divisions of \nSERD will be responsible for overseeing the work of consultants who will be hired to (i) prepare their sector work \nplans, and (ii) take the lead in organizing the working group meetings. \n11 Development partners\u2019 meetings also aim to facilitate greater synergy in the GMS Program with other regional \ninitiatives such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; One Belt, One Road Initiative; and Lancang-Mekong \nRiver Initiative. \n12 The Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division will follow the staff instructions on TA to review and \ninput the planned knowledge products of the TA in K-Nexus. \n13 SERD will collaborate with knowledge departments such as the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department-Knowledge Sharing and Services Center, \nand the ADB Institute in preparing knowledge products, which can be disseminated for greater visibility through \nvarious channels, including the GMS website and the Development Asia website.  \n14 Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Japan.  \n \n ", "4 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision of the Southeast Asia Department (SERD) will implement the TA in consultation with \nSERD resident missions and sector divisions as well as the East Asia Department. It will select, \nsupervise,  and  evaluate  consultants.  The  project  team  will  monitor  TA  implementation  in \ncoordination with respective GMS national secretariats in member countries.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented from October 2017 to December 2019. A total of 223 person-\nmonths of consulting services will be required. Given the wide range of skills and sector expertise \nrequired by the TA (e.g., economics, statistics, agriculture, natural resource management, energy, \nurban development, trade, transport, web design, and programming) coupled with the importance \nof experts\u2019 familiarity with the GMS Program and GMS thrusts, the required expertise is unlikely \nto be available in a single firm. A core group of individual consultants specializing in regional \ncooperation,  economic  development,  and  coordination  will  provide  advisory,  technical,  and \nadministrative support services to assist in the overall management of the GMS Program. Another \ngroup of consultants will be tasked with improving and maintaining the GMS website, project \ndatabase, and statistics database. Individual consultants will also be engaged to write various \nknowledge products or act as resource persons for some of the high-level meetings. \n \n16.  In organizing meetings and workshops, ADB will procure goods and services (such as \nrental of equipment and meeting rooms) using the shopping method. ADB will engage individual \nconsultants and will procure all TA-financed goods in accordance with the ADB Procurement \nPolicy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017) and the associated project \nadministration instructions and TA staff instructions. Disbursements under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n17.  The expected outputs and outcome evaluation will be disseminated (i) internally through \nADB\u2019s in-house publications, activities of the Regional Cooperation and Integration Thematic \nGroup, and internal retreats and workshops; and (ii) externally via the ADB website, presentations \nin various forums, external publications, and feature articles in publications. \n \n18.  ADB, as the central secretariat of the GMS Program, will maintain the GMS website. \nTurning over the website to a single GMS government is not being considered given that none of \nthe GMS governments can take over the management of the website due to limited capacity. \nADB\u2019s guidelines on social media and the branding tool kit will be followed in developing and \nmanaging the website. The website will also be registered in the fixed asset registry in consultation \nwith ADB\u2019s Office of Administrative Services. \n \n19.  The TA will have various knowledge products. The publications will be disseminated \nthrough the GMS website and via ADB workshops and brown bag meetings, and printed for and \ndistributed to stakeholders, when necessary. A limited number of copies of the knowledge \nproducts  will  be  printed  to  (i)  facilitate  their  delivery  to  target  stakeholders  such  as  GMS \ngovernment officials, development partners, and the private sector; and (ii) promote the GMS \nProgram and ADB\u2019s support to the program during high-profile events.15  \n \n                                                \n15 About 150 copies of each report are expected to be printed for the GMS Economic Corridors Forum, Ministerial \nConference, and Summit. The average cost of printing and shipping each report is about $2,000. \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  October 2017\u2013December 2019 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  SERC will play the principal role in administering and supervising the knowledge and \nsupport TAa \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual selectionb  223 person-months  $1,144,000c \nProcurement  Procurement will be undertaken by ADB and will be conducted in accordance with \nADB Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017) \n  Shopping method  14 contracts  $271,000 \nPrinted external  Limited copies of important knowledge products will be printed for dissemination during \npublications  the GMS Summit, Ministerial Conference, and Economic Corridors Forum to promote \nthe program during these high-profile events.  \nSocial media and  ADB as the central secretariat of the GMS Program will develop and maintain the GMS \nwebsites  website.  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The RCIF will be utilized on a front-\nloaded basis. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; EARD = East Asia Department; GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion; RCIF = Regional \nCooperation and Integration Fund; SERC = Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division, SERD; SERD \n= Southeast Asia Department; SETC = Transport and Communications Division, SERD; SEUW = Urban Development \nand Water Division, SERD; TA = technical assistance.  \na  SETC will be responsible for organizing the GMS Subregional Transport Forum while SEUW will organize the GMS \nUrban Development working group meeting. SETC, SEUW, and other sector divisions of SERD will also supervise \nconsultants who may be engaged under the TA to prepare the work plans of the sector working groups. SERC will \ncoordinate with EARD especially with regard to the participation of EARD staff and officials from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China in GMS meetings. EARD staff will participate in or comment on the production of GMS knowledge \nproducts. \nb  The TA will require 29 individual consultant contracts (8 international and 21 national) and 7 resource person contracts. \nSERC has adequate staff capacity to manage the proposed individual contracts in this TA. \nc  Total budget for consultants includes resource persons for workshops and seminars. \nSource: ADB. \n \nIV.
