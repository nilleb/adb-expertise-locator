A  Reconnaissance  Mission  in  February  2003  and  a  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission in April 2003 received strong support for a market access \nand productivity initiative to enhance private sector responsiveness to changes in the world \nmarket  and  improve  productivity.  Strong  private  sector  interest  in  a  financing  facility  was \nforthcoming. Potentially large economic and social benefits come from increased private sector \ncompetitiveness.  Market  access  falls  under  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  The \nGovernment of Nepal asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help evaluate the feasibility \nof enhancing world market access and private sector productivity and, based on the feasibility, \nto prepare an investment project. The Fact-Finding Mission reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, costs, financing, implementation arrangements, and \nterms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  under  the  technical  assistance  (TA).1  The  TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  private  sector  could  play  a  critical  role  for  sustained  economic  growth  and \nemployment growth in Nepal. For more than a decade, ADB has had substantive involvement in \nthe development of the private sector potential in Nepal. In the public sector arena, a three-step \napproach is followed. First, ADB approved an Industrial Sector Program for Nepal in 1993. The \nProgram dealt with many macro issues like rationalizing the tariff structure, duty drawback \nsystem, easing import controls, liberalizing export regulations, streamlining customs procedures \nand industrial relations and incentives, and strengthening sector institutions. The Program was \ntoo ambitious in requirements for Government policy actions, and it did not delve deeply enough \ninto the microeconomic structure of Nepal\u2019s industry sector.2 Nepal is arguably the most open \neconomy  in  the  subregion.  Yet,  the  program  experience  confirms  that  macroeconomic \nadjustments, while necessary, are not sufficient to realize the potential for productivity growth in \nthe  private  sector.  Effective  macroeconomic  adjustments  have  not  automatically  induced \nmicroeconomic reallocation of resources. \n \n3.  Meanwhile, the shallow financial sector integration and financial sector reform issues are \ncomprehensively addressed in ADB\u2019s Corporate and Financial Governance Project (Nov 2000).3 \nThis Project includes rural and small-scale finance components, payments and information \ntechnology for financial services development, and institutional and legal reforms for the private \nsector.  The  Private  Sector  Department  (PSD)  is  preparing  a  Trade  Finance  Facilitation \nProgram, which includes Nepal as one of the candidate countries. In parallel, the World Bank \n(WB) is addressing the management issues of public sector commercial banks under two \nmanagement contracts.  \n \n4.  The TA for Private Sector Development is a logical continuation of ADB\u2019s involvement in \nthe sector, this time to help adjust the microeconomic structure and some of the missing meso \nstructure of Nepal\u2019s private sector to the new competitive environment. With a gradual move \ntoward World Trade Organization (WTO) membership, the economy faces the phaseout of Multi \nFibre Agreements (MFAs) at the same time as the big  neighbors, the People's Republic of \nChina and India, increase their global competitiveness with the phasing in of a new legal and \n                                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 11 March 2003. \n2  ADB. 2002.

", "2  \ninstitutional  environment  for  the  industry  and  the  services  sectors.  In  Nepal,  successful \nrechanneling  of  resources  should  result  in  substantial  productivity  increases,  as \nmacroliberalization has already taken place under ADB\u2019s Industry Sector Program. Yet Nepal\u2019s \nproductivity growth in the services and productive sectors stagnated in the late 1990s, a likely \nresult, among others, of severe supply constraints in the factor markets (e.g., skills shortage, \ninfrastructure shortage, etc.); information barriers and asymmetries between markets; severed \nmarket linkages preventing the private sector to avail of economies of scale, scope, networks \nand agglomeration; barriers to coordination and collective action among key private sector \nplayers, which prevents pooling of resources and organizational capabilities; and barriers to \ncompetition, linked possibly to adverse incentive regimes. The rechanneling of resources toward \nmost productive uses has been slow to take hold in Nepal and is unlikely to take hold unless the \nhurdles to market access and productivity growth are addressed and overcome. \n \n5.  Many firms do not employ modern management practices to improve productivity and \ncompetitiveness. Export products are likely to succeed in promising markets only when local \nexporters build up enough capabilities. In Nepal, the private sector lacks infrastructure for \ninformation  flows  and  transparent  interaction  with  providers  of  raw  materials  and  capital \nequipment,  transport  and  other  intermediaries,  marketing  establishments,  and  finally  the \nconsumer in target markets. Therefore market linkages are severed as Nepal\u2019s producers and \nservice providers are not linked to established market networks of key company names, and \nthey lack access to established networks of the international project market, be it in software, in \ndesign-oriented sectors, or in medical inputs (herbs) or services. Commercial service providers \n(e.g., business publication firms, credit rating and credit checking firms, export market research \nfirms, export insurance companies, marketing consultants, quality control firms, testing and \ncertification laboratories) can help Nepal\u2019s manufacturers and services firms to connect to \npromising export markets. They can facilitate connections by finding buyers and customers, \ncountertrade and buyback partners, agents, representatives, or distributors. \n \n6.  The private sector in Nepal is conscious of coordination challenges and collective action \nproblems. Firms within the sector are very heterogeneous in size, interests, technology, and \nlinkages and connections to particular domestic and foreign business and ethnic groups, and \nthus  experience  difficulties  in  pooling  resources  and  knowledge  for  market  access  and \nproductivity growth.  Firms that cannot coordinate actions and collectively bundle resources all \nend up in a worse position than those that can make binding agreements. Indeed,  when \nadjustment to markets is painful, domestic producers and narrowly focused groups often try to \nprocure some protective government intervention and thus hold on to the status quo, without \nconsidering coordinated responses to market challenges. The consequences for economic \nproductivity and growth in the future are negative. Under such circumstances, the public sector \nshould stimulate private sector development by removing barriers to coordination and collective \naction,  thus  facilitating  adjustment  to  emerging  comparative  advantage  by  enhancing  the \ncompetitive environment. \n \n7.  While  pervasive  globalization  connects  and  integrates  markets  and  thus  builds \ncomparative  advantage,  it  also  enables  greater  specialization,  decentralization,  and \nagglomeration of specialized services, production, and distribution. Specialization in a global \nchain  of  inputs  and  markets  leads  to  tremendous  gains,  with  economic  opportunities  for \nemployment and income growth in a subregion. Outsourcing to reduce the cost of production \nand services centers helps global firms improve their competitiveness, and at the same time \ninduces Nepal\u2019s firms to bring their strength to the table. Concentration of low-cost activities in \nlow-cost locations leads to agglomeration gains (so called \u201clocalization economies\u201d) and allows \nfirms to reap economies of scale. When many firms are located in proximity to others, benefits ", "  3\ninclude exchange of knowledge and local buyer-supplier networks. Employees with specific \nskills will be attracted to firm clusters giving access to a specialized labor pool. These gains can \nonly  be  realized  when  the  institutions  are  in  place  to  solve  coordination  and  information \nproblems.  \n \n8.  In  a  globally  connected  production  and  trading  system  where  specialization, \ndecentralization, and agglomeration economies are pervasive, the distribution of private versus \nsocial (public) benefits arising from development projects and investments needs to be carefully \ndifferentiated and weighed. Although there is ample scope for  private firms to participate as \nsuppliers and buyers, many of the benefits from institutional and coordination arrangements \nleading to improved market access are highly diffused across society, leading to a public good \ninvestment. Impact and direct and indirect poverty analysis becomes a crucial vehicle for \ndetermining public sector support needs for private sector development. The distribution of \nbenefits  enables  proper  identification  of  risk-bearing  capacity  and  related  propensity  for \ninvestments. \n \n9.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  subregional  integration,  specialization,  and \nagglomeration  in  a  globally  connected  economy,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal \nestablished the South Asia Growth Quadrangle. At the request of the participating countries, \nADB initiated a series of TAs to support development through ADB\u2019s South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation Program (SASEC). The proposed TA fits into the TA series, as trade \nand investment development with private sector involvement is one of the five SASEC priority \nsectors. The 2002 Nepal Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) includes a prospective \nPrivate Sector Development Loan for 2004 in the ADB lending program to facilitate private \nsector participation in the economy and to enhance the market environment for increased \ncompetition and productivity critical for higher economic growth and reduction of poverty. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The removal of macropolicy and legal and institutional constraints has not yet prompted \na strong private sector response. The private sector will effectively respond to such removal \nonly when it is able to acquire resources, such as a trained workforce, price and quality \ncompetitive factor inputs, finance, information and market access, and to readjust them to \nchanging domestic and international market opportunities. ADB\u2019s private sector intervention will \nimprove the private sector's capacity to respond to Nepal\u2019s emerging comparative advantage.  \n \n11.  The TA will (i) identify any further policy, legal, and institutional constraints that prevent \nthe  private  sector  from  responding  effectively  to  market  opportunities;  (ii)  analyze  recent \ndevelopments  in  the  competitiveness  of  Nepal\u2019s  industry  and  services  sectors,  and  the \nintegration of these sectors with key international markets; (iii) select the key factors behind the \npresent restrained response to emerging comparative advantage in market niches, such as \nsupply constraints in factor markets; information barriers and asymmetries between markets; \nsevered market linkages preventing the private sector to avail of economies of scale, scope, \nnetworks and agglomeration; barriers to coordination and collective action among key private \nsector players that prevent pooling of resources and organizational capabilities; and barriers to \ncompetition linked possibly to adverse incentive regimes; and (iv) develop and institute effective \nmechanisms to help the private sector respond to the identified issues and obstacles to sector \ndevelopment in the emerging market environment.  ", "4  \n \nB.  Methodology and key Activities \n12.  The TA will have four components, which will be implemented in sequence: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Identify policy, legal, and institutional constraints to the \nprivate  sector.  The  consultant  will,  among  others,  review  and  analyze  Nepal\u2019s \ncompetition policies, including those on foreign direct investment (FDI), and evaluate the \ninstitutional setup and capabilities for an open and competitive private sector economy. \nStart-up hurdles including property right issues, which prevent the private sector from \nobtaining a critical mass in market niches, require particular attention. Comparative \nexperiences of other countries with successful private sector development will be taken \ninto account. The consultants will outline terms of reference for a TA with a competition \nframework  under  a  possible  loan.  In  light  of  the  findings,  a  program  component \nspecifying  key  policy  conditionalities  may  be  proposed.  The  TA  and  program \ncomponents are related to a market access and matching fund, as illustrated in the \ndiagram (Appendix 4 for project implementation scenario). \n \n(ii)  Component 2: Analyze competitiveness and identify emerging comparative \nadvantage for Nepal\u2019s industry and services sectors. The consultant will review and \nanalyze  the  existing  studies  on  Nepal\u2019s  competitive  situation,  particularly  the  work \nundertaken  by  WB,  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  United \nNations  Industrial  Development  Organization  (UNIDO).  The  review  will  be \ncomplemented by analysis of trade volumes and values, degree of export diversification, \nand related trends among others. New export opportunities that may emerge from trends \nshould be linked to specific international market networks. Export opportunities should \nbe seen in view of WTO norms. This analysis will include the review of key factor \nmarkets, including the labor market in Nepal, and may identify a possible emerging \ncomparative advantage for Nepal\u2019s private sector. \n \n(iii)  Component  3:  Develop  a  market  access  mechanism  and  financing \nmechanism for private sector development. The consultants will survey the financing \nmechanisms  currently  available  to  or  lacking  in  businesses  operating  in  promising \nsectors (e.g., debt financing and terms, maturities, equity financing, insurance, credit \nenhancements, etc.). To fill any gaps, a financing mechanism will very likely be set up to \novercome identified obstacles to increased competitiveness for Nepal\u2019s private sector. \nConsultants will develop the institutional, management, market,  financing, legal, and \nregulatory  aspects  in  a  business  plan  for  the  market  access  and  matching  fund. \nConsultants will determine ADB\u2019s role in the financing mechanisms and help reach \nagreement  on  the  participation  of  stakeholders,  including  the  private  sector  and \ninternational technology and knowledge partners (see illustrative diagram for project \nimplementation scenario, Appendix 4). \n \n(iv)  Component  4:  Develop  project  concepts  in  response  to  private  sector \nconstraints. Based on the preceding analysis, the consultant will develop detailed \nconcepts for specific project components (including, for instance, a TA component) to be \nfinanced by ADB. Viable concepts have to be accompanied by economic impact analysis \n(including summary poverty, social, and environment impact assessment [Appendix 2]) \nthat clearly identifies and measures public goods emanating from public sector support \nof private sector development, due to, for instance, improved factor supplies, lowered \ninformation  barriers,  stronger  market  linkages,  and  private  sector  networks  (e.g., ", "  5\nimitation  of  successful  exporters,  improvements  of  product  quality,  and  spread  of \ntechnology spread in the economy).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $490,000 equivalent, comprising $330,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $160,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $400,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, financed by the Government of Japan, \nto cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $330,000 and $70,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The Government will provide the rest of the local currency cost in kind. Details of \nthe cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supply \n(MOICS). With MOICS, a business consultative group comprising representatives from the \nprivate sector and select Government Ministries will be set up.  Private sector representation \nfrom various areas is considered essential and could include representation from the Federation \nof Nepali Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI),  Computer Association of Nepal, \nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal, Foreign Investors of Nepal, and Nepal Tourism \nBoard (private sector representative). Owing to the need for coordination among various areas \nof the Government, representation from the Secretariat -- Prime Minister's Office, the National \nPlanning Commission, and the Ministry of Finance \u2013 would be appropriate, in addition to \nrepresentation from other relevant ministries, such as the Ministry of Science and Technology, \nMinistry of Information and Communication, Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, and Ministry \nof Labour and Transport. \n \n15.  An international consulting team in association with a domestic team will be engaged to \nimplement the TA. A biodata proposal is deemed sufficient for the selection. The consultants will \nbe selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The Quality and \nCost-Based Selection is applicable. The TA will require about 11 person-months of service from \ninternational  consultants  with  expertise  in  (i)  supply  chain  analysis,  with  a  background  in \nsubregional connectivity projects; (ii) international trade cum industrial organization economics; \n(iii) impact evaluation (including direct-indirect poverty, social aspects, environment) of private \nsector  development;  (iv)  competition  policy  and  institutions,  and  law/antitrust;  and  (v) \nmanagement/institutional  experts  in  finance  vehicles,  marketing  support,  and  international \nsupply  chain  and  market  access.  An  additional  14  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices will be required in the same disciplines. The consulting services will be carried out over \n7\u20138 months from end-August 2003 to March 2004. The outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 4.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for preparing the Market Access and Productivity Growth for the \nPrivate Sector Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

An international consultant will act as team leader and be responsible for the overall \nmanagement of the technical assistance (TA), timely delivery of the TA outputs, and the \nconsistency in quality of the outputs, whereas the team experts will ensure the quality of their \nrespective TA components.  The team leader should help develop and aggregate detailed \nconcepts  for  specific  project  components  and  programs  to  be  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and as identified by other experts on the team (for instance help the \nteam to develop the project framework). The team of consultants will include a supply chain \nexpert with a background in subregional projects, a trade cum industrial organization economist, \na specialist for impact evaluation (including direct-indirect poverty, social aspects, environment), \nlegal expert with  speciality in competition law/antitrust, management/institutional experts for \nestablishing finance vehicles, and marketing support and international supply chain and market \naccess expert. The international experts are supported by respective domestic consultants. \n \n2.  The team will prepare an inception report within 5 weeks of the start of consulting \nservices. This report will assess the investment feasibility, and then detail the field services \nrequired for assessing economic impact (including direct and indirect poverty impact). The \ninception report will also contain a first-cut business plan with operating budget for the planned \ninvestment facility. The inception report will be discussed at a stakeholders meeting, which will \nbe organized by the consultant team. An interim report will be submitted about 3 months after \nthe start of services. As a midterm report, it will contain a draft project framework. Any study tour \nwill be detailed and implemented by the team. The interim report will be peer-reviewed by ADB \nstaff, possibly in conjunction with a team leader visit to headquarters. A draft final report, to be \nsubmitted about 5 months into the consultancy, will coincide with another workshop, or a similar \nevent  as  necessary,  to  present  and  facilitate  the  dissemination  of  the  findings  and \nrecommendations of the TA to private sector interests and Government officials. Throughout the \nwork, the team will cooperatively and iteratively assess investment feasibility and detail the \nprospective project. A final report in both hard copy and electronic form will incorporate the \ncomments of the Government and ADB. As deemed necessary, the team leader will present key \nfindings at ADB headquarters in Manila at midterm or at the final stage of the TA.  \n \n3.  The  TA  will  comprise  four  components:  (i)  identify  any  further  policy,  legal,  and \ninstitutional constraints that restrain the private sector's ability to respond effectively to market \nopportunities; (ii) analyze recent developments in the competitiveness of Nepal\u2019s industry and \nservices sectors, and the integration of these sectors with key international markets; (iii) select \nthe key factors causing the present restrained response to emerging comparative advantage in \nmarket  niches,  such  as  supply  constraints  in  factor  markets;  information  barriers  and \nasymmetries between markets; severed market linkages preventing the private sector to avail of \neconomies of scale, scope, networks and agglomeration; barriers to coordination and collective \naction among key private sector players, which prevent pooling of resources and organizational \ncapabilities; and barriers to competition linked possibly to adverse incentive regimes; and (iv) \ndevelop and institute effective mechanisms to help the private sector respond to the identified \nissues and obstacles to sector development in the emerging market environment. Based on \nthese results, a project framework will be devised. The team will prepare the project in standard \nADB sector development project format. \n \nA.  Identify  Policy,  Legal,  and  Institutional  Constraints  to  the  private  sector \n(Component 1) \n4.  The  legal  consultants  (international  and  domestic,  1.0  and  3.0  person-months, \nrespectively) will, among others, review and analyze Nepal\u2019s competition policies, including ", "Appendi4x   11\nthose for foreign direct investment, and evaluate the institutional setup and capabilities for an\nopen and competitive private sector economy. This review will be complemented by the trade\nand industrial organization economists'  analysis of industry and service sector organizations\n(firm sizes, production, value added, employment, entry and exit dynamics, geographic location\nand sector networks, factor market analysis, risk mitigation mechanisms for the private sector).\nSpecific tasks of the consultants are as follows:\nList and review private sector development and regulation (regulatory bodies),\n(i)\nindustry sector and investment regulation in view of the ongoing Corporate and\nFinancial Sector Program.\nEstablish what antitrust legislation and capabilities should be in place. Examine\n(ii)\naccounting and disclosure, double taxation issues, build-operate-transfer policy,\netc.\nInvestigate the start-up hurdles, including property right issues, which prevent the\n(iii)\nprivate sector from obtaining a critical mass in promising market niches.\nDescribe  the  experiences  of  other  countries  with  successful  private  sector\n(iv)\ndevelopment.\n(v) Outline terms of reference for a TA   for a competition framework under a possible\nloan.\n(vi) Design a program component (key policy conditionalities) under the proposed\nADB intervention.\nAnalyze  Competitiveness  and  Identify  Emerging  Comparative  Advantage  for\nB.\nNepal's Industry and Services Sectors (Component 2)\n5.  The trade  cum industrial  organization  economists  (international and 2 domestic, 2.5\nand 7.0 person-months) will review and analyze the existing studies on Nepal's competitive\nsituation. This analysis will help identify a possible emerging comparative advantage for Nepal's\nprivate sector. The market access specialist will  ensure  that  comparative  advantage  is\ntranslated into market access for Nepal. The legal experts will support the identification and\nanalysis of  institutions that  promote or hinder the  development of factor  markets,  and will\nevaluate institutional capabilities.. The specific tasks of the consultants are as follows:\nBe familiar with the findings of the ongoing and completed World Bank, and other\n(i)\naid agencies' studies on Nepal's competitiveness.\nAnalyze, among others, trade volumes in value and quantity by target countries\n(ii)\nand markets, imports and exports, by sector.\nQuantify the overall export diversification of Nepal on a three/four-digit  (ISIC)\n(iii)\nsector level.\nCalculate unit export values over a period of time at a sufficient sector level,\n(iv)\nrelate to standards of international export competitiveness, and discern trends\nwith  the  purpose  of  identifying  Nepal's strengths  and  weaknesses  in  export\ndevelopment.\nWith the supply  chain  specialist,  and based on a focused  business survey,\n(v)\nanalyze and benchmark typical business transactio,ns and their transaction costs.\nView  export opportunitiesfr om the perspectiveof World Trade Organization\n(vi)\n(WTO) nOm1Sth at will come into force in Indiaand The People'sR  epublico f", "12 Appendix 4 \nChina in 2005.

In addition, market access specialists (international and domestic, 1.0 and 1.0 person-\nmonths) will undertake the following tasks: \n \n(xiv)  Link export opportunities to specific international market networks.  \n(xv)  Analyze key supplier-buyer relationships, and communication and information \nstructures.  \n(xvi)  Conduct an economic risk analysis and risk mitigation along the supply and value \nchains. \n(xvii)  Review  the  availability  of  modern  trade  finance  mechanisms  (bank  credit \ninstruments and their electronic transmission, and related payment risk transfer). \n \nC.  Develop a Market Access Mechanism and Financing Mechanism for Private Sector \nDevelopment (Component 3) \n \n7.  The management expert for finance vehicles (international and domestic, 2.5 and 1.0 \nperson-months) will design financing mechanisms to overcome identified private sector hurdles \non  the  way  to  increased  competitiveness.  The  consultant  will  develop  the  institutional, \nmanagement,  market,  financing,  legal  and  regulatory  aspects  in  a  business  plan  for  the \nmechanism.  The  legal experts  and  market  access  experts will  support  this  work.  The \nconsultants will undertake these tasks: \n \n(i)  Survey the financing mechanisms currently available (or lacking) for businesses \noperating in promising sectors (e.g., debt financing and terms, maturities, equity \nfinancing, insurance, credit enhancements, etc.).  \n(ii)  Consider appropriate funding sources and mechanisms (other than ADB and the \nGovernment).  Possible  sources  include  common  service  and  business ", "Appendix4   13\ninfrastructure levy on sectors that benefit from network and agglomeration\nimpacts,o  r mechanismst o accessf inancialm  arkets( both dollars and rupees).\n(iii) Developt he institutional,f inancing, legal, and regulatorya spects in the business\nplan  of  a  financing  mechanism to  finance  private  sector  development\ninvestmentsa long key trade and businessc orridorsa nd chains that exhibit public\ngoods aspects and therefore are not suitable for pure private sector financing\nand investment.\n(Iv) Taking a value chain/networkp erspective,a s determinedb y the market access\nspecialist.

Develop Project Concepts in Response to Private Sector Constraints (Component \n4) \n \n8.  Detailed concepts for specific project components and programs to be financed by ADB \nand as identified by other experts of the team (leading to, if applicable, to implementation \narrangements)  need  to  be  supported  by  impact  analysis.  Viable  concepts  have  to  be \naccompanied by economic impact analysis, which clearly identifies and measures public goods \nemanating from public sector support of private sector development, due to, for instance, \nimproved factor supplies, lowered information barriers,  stronger market linkages, and private \nsector networks, etc. An impact analysis consultant will primarily undertake impact analysis. \n \n9.  The supply chain experts (international and domestic, 2.5 and 2.0 person-months) will \nundertake these tasks: \n \n(i)  Assemble the data that traces enterprise linkages (hard, soft, and information), \nincluding,  among  others,  subregional  linkages  through  logistics  chains;  and \ncoordinate with ADB subregional-corridor study. \n(ii)  Build  a  logistics  model,  including  estimation  of  trade  impacts  from  logistics \nimprovements. \n(iii)  Analyze logistics chains to establish enterprise savings from chain improvements \nand potential investments. \n \n10.  The impact analysis consultant (international, 1.5 person-months) will undertake these \ntasks: \n \n(iv)  Do a geographic information system (GIS) analysis on the basis of an impact \nmodel, by utilizing existing image maps and data sets, and with the data inputs of \nthe supply chain experts.  \n(v)  Break down employment analysis by income levels and geographic location \n(poor, medium, rich persons/households). \n(vi)  In the light of identified project and program interventions, geographic analysis \nwith a model of economic activities and clusters, and their interrelationship and \ninteractions, assess gains from greater market specialization, decentralization \nalong a supply chain, and agglomeration of specialized services, production, and \ndistribution. \n(vii)  Undertake summary environment and social impact analysis (in conjunction with \npoverty  impact  analysis).  The  environmental  assessment  will  follow  ADB's \nGuidelines  on  Environmental  Assessment.  It  will  include  environmental \nsafeguards for any matching fund component and will review the environmental \nimplications of a policy matrix. \n(viii)  For impact analysis, take into account the ADB's Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects, and adhere to ADB's standards and procedures on social \nand environmental impact analysis. \n \n \n ", "Appendix4  15\nTeam Matrix\nIllustrative Project Scenario Based on International Case Studies\nGovernment\nInternational\nADe  Co  orate\nLocal\nFirm\nLink\nIn Supply\nLocal\n~5\n::\n'\"\n~..\n~c':\nco\".", "16 Appendix 4 \nThe Government, ADB, and corporations from identified target markets will establish a joint \nfacility that will manage and administer a debt-equity matching fund, aimed at local firms that \nestablish the key link between target international markets and the local supplier network. The \nlocal supplier network will comprise many small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The fund can \nalso be utilized for key broad-based private-sector-oriented institutions and infrastructure; for \ninstance,  management  training  outfits,  standard-setting  institutions,  or  common  storage \nfacilities. The TA may identify policy actions \u2013 for example \u2013 for a competition framework that \nthe Government can undertake, with ADB support in a program component. ADB can also \nsupport, through TA, a facilitator who brings in international best-practice know-how for similar \njoint facilities and matching funds. The facilitator will be of short duration, and his position will be \nphased out when the management and organizational capabilities of the joint facilities and fund \nhave reached a comfortable level. International corporations can also avail themselves of credit \nenhancements, for instance to cover their political risks, and to entice foreign engagement in \njoint  ventures  with  local  counterpart  firms  in  Nepal.  Second-tier  SME  suppliers  may  be \nsupported by strengthened local support institutions and by an ADB-funded TA revolving fund, \nwhich are market oriented.
