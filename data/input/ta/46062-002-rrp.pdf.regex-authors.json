THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Baiyin Integrated Urban Development \nProject.1  \n \n2.  The  project  will  support  inclusive  and  environmentally  sound  transformation  of  a \nresource-exhausted city in the western inland region of the PRC. The project will (i) construct \ncentralized water supply and wastewater treatment systems, and a road for a new industrial \npark;  (ii)  upgrade  skill training  courses  on technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \n(TVET) and a labor market database to support industrial transformation; (iii) install intelligent \ntransport systems (ITSs) for road safety and public bus services to improve livability of the city; \nand (iv) enhance environmental management of the industrial park.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The PRC is rapidly becoming urbanized. During 1992\u20132012, the urban population grew \nfrom 322 million to 712 million, representing a rise from 27% to 53% of the total population.3 \nAbout two-thirds of the urban population growth came from rural\u2013urban migration. Until the \n1980s, many provinces and autonomous regions in the west had the advantage of serving as \nnational mineral-based resource centers. A number of mining and resource-intensive heavy \nindustries  were  deployed  in  the  region.  In  the  1990s,  the  national  opening-up  policy  and \ncoordinated development strategy focused on the eastern region, which led to large flows of \nforeign capital into the coastal cities. Meanwhile, reduced production and depletion of mineral \nresources slowed socioeconomic development of some western inland provinces. The National \nStrategy for Development of the West launched in 1999 directly supported the western region to \nreduce  the  consequential  regional  imbalance.  However,  slow  development  of  cities  in  the \nwestern region, continuous outflow of migrant workers to cities in the eastern coastal region, \nand urban\u2013rural income disparities continue to be urban development challenges in the PRC.4 \n \n4.  Gansu province is one of the poor provinces targeted under the National Strategy for \nDevelopment of the West. Its per capita gross domestic product in 2013 was CNY24,438, the \nsecond  lowest  in  the  PRC  after  Guizhou  province.  Gansu  also  suffers  from  high  poverty \nincidence: 8.4% for urban households and 68.6% for rural households, much higher than the \nnational averages of 2.8% for urban households and 13.1% for rural households. Gansu\u2019s \nmineral resources production has gradually declined, and its economic transition from primary \nand  secondary  industries  to  high  value-adding  manufacturing  and  service-based  tertiary \nindustries has been slow. Baiyin, a medium-sized city close to the provincial capital of Lanzhou, \nis a typical case. In the 1950s, the city was originally established as a national copper mining \nbase.  The  city\u2019s  development  was  fueled  by  strong  growth  of  mining  and  metallurgical \nindustries. However, since 1985, its socioeconomic development has suffered major setbacks \nafter continuous copper exploitation and depletion, and associated environmental degradation. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2013. Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Gansu Baiyin Urban Development II Project. Manila \n(TA 8381-PRC). \n3  National Bureau of Statistics. 2013. China Statistical Yearbook 2013. Beijing: Government of the PRC. \n4  In 2012, average gross domestic product per capita of the 12 western inland municipality, provinces, and \nautonomous regions was 75% of the national average, and only 58% of that of the eastern coastal region. ", "2 \nIn 2008, Baiyin was officially listed as one of the first resource-exhausted cities in transition and \nbecame a recipient of special funding support from the Government of the PRC.5 Baiyin was \nalso  designated  as  a  resource-exhausted  city  transformation  demonstration  area  in  2011. \nFurther, Gansu launched the Lanzhou\u2013Baiyin Economic Zone in 2011 to boost its regional \neconomic development by integrating cities and industrial bases.6 \n \n5.  Although Baiyin\u2019s industrial output grew by 13.5% annually in 2008\u20132013, its per capita \ngross domestic product is only 64% of the national average. The city continues to struggle to \ndiversify its economy and transform its industrial base. In 2012, Baiyin still relied on nonferrous \nmetal, chemical, and coal-based energy industries, similar to the situation in 1985.7 Baiyin also \nhas difficulty attracting more people. The total population increased by 0.1% per annum during \n2000\u20132012, while the urban population grew by 2.4%. Urban unemployment rates remained \nhigh at about 20%. For Baiyin to accelerate its transformation from a resource-exhausted mining \ncity into an inclusive and green city, the city needs to (i) accelerate its industrial transformation \nand build a resilient foundation for economic development, (ii) reverse the trend of layoffs and \nstop talent outflow by strengthening the provision of human resource development for local and \nemerging  industries,  (iii)  demonstrate  its  commitment  to  environmentally  sound  and  green \nindustrial city development, and (iv) raise the city\u2019s livability and quality of life to attract people \nfrom surrounding areas to support its industrial transformation. \n \n6.  Project  preparation  identified  that  the  transformation  cannot  be  achieved  through \ninfrastructure development alone. The value addition of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \nits  comprehensive  approach  covering  infrastructure,  human  resources,  and  environmental \ncapacity development. As a model city, Baiyin\u2019s successful transformation approach can be \nreplicated by other resource-exhausted cities. The project also incorporates lessons from a \nprevious ADB project in Baiyin and other urban, education, and transport sector projects in the \nPRC.8 These include (i) setting aspirational but realistic targets with measurable performance \nindicators, (ii) comprehensive due diligence on land acquisition and resettlement including past \nresettlement activities, (iii) strong start-up procurement support by an experienced tendering \nagency, and (iv) advance engagement of key consulting services and preparation of equipment \ncontracts for early disbursement. The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2011\u20132015 for the PRC for inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth.9 The project is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  operational  plan  as  it  demonstrates  competitive,  inclusive,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable city transformation in a poor region.10 The project also supports the \nPRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  by  supporting  the  rebalancing  of  its  regional \ndevelopment, which is expected to continue during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan period. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be inclusive and environmentally sustainable development in Baiyin. The \noutcome will be accelerated industrial transformation and economic diversification of Baiyin. \n                                                \n5  In 2008, Baiyin was listed as one of 18 national resource-exhausted cities which received special support for \neconomic transformation under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. \n6  In 2012, the zone has 21% of the provincial population and produces 35% of provincial gross regional product. \n7  The composition of sector industries has been unchanged in 2000\u20132012: primary 11%\u201316%, secondary 52%\u201357%, \nand tertiary 31%\u201333%. Output shares of different industries in the secondary sector remain almost the same, \nexcept for a slight decline in the nonferrous metal industry and some increases in the coal-based energy industry \nand chemical industry during 1985\u20132012. \n8  ADB. 2008.

Output 1: Liuchuan Industrial Park infrastructure development. Liuchuan Industrial \nPark (LIP) is one of three important national and provincial industrial parks expected to lead \nBaiyin\u2019s industrial transformation and economic diversification. In June 2014, 41% of the total \narea of 23 square kilometers was committed for industries. Based on its access to rare-earth \nmaterials, the LIP offers unique opportunities for high value-adding manufacturing industries \nsuch as batteries for renewable energy equipment and green vehicles, computer appliances \nand light-emitting diode products. The project will assist the LIP itself to be developed as a \ngreen  industrial  park.  For  the  first  time  in  Baiyin,  the  project  will  finance  both  water  and \nwastewater systems dedicated for an industrial park and its residential areas. To optimize water \nuse efficiency, the treated wastewater will be reused for landscape irrigation and industrial \nprocesses. The water supply system includes a plant with a supply capacity of 60,000 cubic \nmeters  per  day,  a  14.4  kilometer  (km)  water  transmission  pipeline,  and  a  14.0  km  water \ndistribution  pipeline  network  and  other  related  facilities.  The  project-financed  wastewater \nsystem,  including  a  plant  with  treatment  capacity  of  35,000 cubic  meters  per  day,  sludge \ntreatment facilities, and a 46.0 km wastewater collection pipeline network, will enable the LIP to \nmeet the highest effluent standard in the PRC. A project-financed 6.0 km main artery road will \nhave  energy-saving  streetlights  installed.  The  output  will  demonstrate  green  industrial \ndevelopment to support the city\u2019s economy and social welfare for providing job opportunities. \n \n9.  Output 2: Technical and vocational education and training enhancement. As a \nresult of prolonged economic recession and closure of traditional mining industries, Baiyin \nbecame a source of nonskilled migrant workers for cities outside of Baiyin and further in the \neastern coastal region. The existing TVET provision only gives people general skills. Labor \ninformation  is  not  collected  and  managed  efficiently  to  match  the  demand  and  supply  for \nworkers. The output will provide holistic TVET support to secondary and adult skill education \nand  employment  services,  ensuring  inclusive  industrial  transformation.  For  Baiyin\u2019s  TVET \nsystem  to  actively  support  the  city\u2019s  transformation,  the  project  will  introduce  the  first \ncompetency-based  curriculum  for  3-year  long-term  courses  and  short-term  courses  in  the \nJingyuan County Secondary Vocational School and public employment training centers. The \ncourses will be designed to respond to existing and changing skills demands of LIP industries. \nThe project-financed teacher training will enhance the institutional capacity of TVET service \nproviders and ensure skilled workers are locally available. Under the project, public training \ncenter and school facilities will be upgraded, and training equipment will be purchased for LIP \nindustries  and  supporting  service  industries  including  electronics,  mechanical  machine \noperation, business accounting, and restaurant services. Project support will also be provided \nfor labor employment in Baiyin by strengthening a labor market information system including \ninformation and communication technology equipment, computer software, and staff training for \npublic employment services. \n \n10.  Output 3: Intelligent transport systems installation. The output will promote green \ncity development and enhance city livability in Baiyin, thereby attracting more people to support \nits  industrial  transformation.  Although  Baiyin  central  district  had  sufficient  road  capacity  to \naccommodate the number of registered vehicles in 2012, a gradual increase in the urban \npopulation and registered vehicles started to cause traffic congestion in the central area at peak \ntimes. Moreover, violation of traffic rules and road accidents are increasing sharply. The public \nbus service is expected to offer an alternative and preferred choice of mobility for people, but \nthe obsolete bus control and monitoring system only achieved a 60% punctuality rate in 2012 \nand therefore the service failed to increase its modal share. The project will finance two ITSs by \ninstalling (i) a traffic police ITS with a traffic operation center, signal control equipment, video \n ", "4 \nmonitoring, violation recording and traffic guidance equipment, and operational software; and (ii) \na public transport ITS with a bus operation center, bus onboard equipment, stop and depot \nequipment, and operational software. \n \n11.  Output 4: Enhanced environmental management and capacity development. The \noutput will develop an environmental management system (EMS) for the LIP. This ensures that \nBaiyin\u2019s industrial transformation will not be at the expense of the environment. A team of \nexperts  will  help  the  Liuchuan  Industrial  Park  Management  Committee  (LMC),  one  of  the \nimplementing  agencies,  to  establish  an  ISO  14001-certified  EMS  for  the  LIP  and  pursue \naccreditation of an eco-industrial park under the PRC national standard by 2025.11 Through this, \nthe project aims for the LIP to be the first accredited eco-industrial park in Gansu and the \nwestern inland region of the PRC. The output will also strengthen institutional capacities for \nproject management and operation by providing expert support on project management, and \ndesign and implementation of the TVET subproject. The consulting services will support public \nawareness  activities  on  road  safety  and  provide  capacity  development  activities  on  public \nfinancial management. Training on innovative infrastructure financing will emphasize public\u2013\nprivate partnership so as to create an enabling environment in Baiyin to encourage participation \nof the private sector in the city\u2019s industrial transformation. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $212.7 million (Table 1), of which 69% of the base cost \nwill finance civil works, 16% for mechanical and equipment, and 1% for consultants. \n \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

The government has requested a loan of $100.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  a  straight-line  repayment  option;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; the interest during construction to be capitalized in the \nloan; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 15.3 years and the maturity premium payable to \nADB is 0.1% per annum. The ADB loan will also finance taxes and duties for eligible ADB-\nfinanced expenditures and transportation and insurance costs included in the base cost for \nensuring smooth project implementation. The loan will finance 47.0% of the project cost. The \ngovernment  will  finance  $112.7  million,  including  $79.9  million  from  the  Baiyin  municipal \ngovernment (BMG) and $32.8 million through borrowing from local banks (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \n  Ordinary capital resources (loan)  100.0  47.0 \nBaiyin municipal government  79.9  37.6 \nOthers (domestic banks)  32.8  15.4 \nTotal  212.7   100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n16.  The project is technically feasible as a result of detailed examinations of compatibility \nwith the PRC\u2019s engineering guidelines, projections of traffic demand, water supply demand and \nwastewater generation, required treated effluent quality, industrial skills development needs, \nand  needs  of  traffic  safety  and  public  transportation  management.  Development  of  other \ninfrastructure in the LIP is ongoing and everything needed by industries to move to the LIP will \nbe completed before project completion. Analysis of alternative technical options confirmed \noperational feasibility of the water and wastewater treatment systems, and ensured road cross-\nsection design considering road safety for operation of heavy industrial vehicles. The project will \nprovide capacity development training to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) \nof project facilities. Vocational skills training, enhanced course contents, information technology \nequipment, and teacher training will overcome the weaknesses of limited (i) TVET service \nprovision and quality, (ii) partnerships between TVET providers and industries, and (iii) capacity \nto handle labor market information. The BMG and LMC committed under a loan assurance to \nlead the coordination between LIP industries and local TVET providers. ITS designs considered \ntraffic projection for the next 5\u201310 years and identified the most appropriate scale of investment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n17.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis evaluated technical options and confirmed \nthat the project adopted least-cost ways to support Baiyin\u2019s transformation. Economic internal \nrates of return were computed at 14.9% for the overall project, 14.2% for the LIP infrastructure \ndevelopment subproject, 20.0% for the TVET subproject, and 19.9% for the ITS subproject. All \nexceeded  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12.0%.  The  project\u2019s  quantifiable \neconomic benefits include (i) time saving by construction of the LIP\u2019s main artery road, (ii) \nwillingness to pay for improved water supply and sanitation services, (iii) increased wages after \nskills  training  at  secondary  level  and  adult  education,  (iv)  avoided  road  accidents  and \nassociated loss, and (v) time saving from more punctual public bus operation. The economic \ncosts comprise capital costs, including physical contingencies, and O&M costs.13 \n                                                \n13 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n18.  Financial  analysis.  A  financial  evaluation  was  conducted  of  the  water  supply  and \nwastewater  treatment  systems,  which  have  a  cost-recovery  objective.  A  single  operator  is \nenvisaged and, therefore, the analysis combined cost and revenue for water and wastewater \ntreatment services. The analysis indicated that the financial internal rate of return is 3.4%, which \nexceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 2.5%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the \nproject is most sensitive to decreases in revenue by 10%, where the financial internal rate of \nreturn  is  marginally  lower  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  at  2.0%.  Water  and \nwastewater  treatment  tariffs  are  expected  to  increase  by  10%  every  3  years,  which  is \nconsidered realistic because users of water and wastewater services are primarily industries, \nand the current level of tariffs are lower than in the other two national and provincial industrial \nparks in Baiyin. \n \n19.  Financial impact assessment was carried out to ensure fiscal sustainability during project \nimplementation and operation. Financial capacities of the BMG, Jingyuan county government \n(JCG),  and  LMC  were  assessed  against  annual  counterpart  funds  required  for  capital \nexpenditures (BMG), local bank loans debt service (JCG and LMC), and debt service for the \nADB loan (BMG). The assessment also concluded that the BMG, JCG, LMC, and Baiyin Public \nTransportation Company have sufficient financial capacities to finance O&M during operation. \nAnnual  counterpart  funds  and  interest  during  construction  will  be  0.5%  of  projected  fiscal \nrevenues of the BMG, and ADB debt service during operation will be 0.1%. The combined \nfinancial impact of debt service and O&M on the LMC were projected to be high because the \nLIP will not be in full operation until 2020. Since the LMC\u2019s fiscal revenue relies solely on the \nJCG, additional due diligence analysis was conducted against the JCG on debt service and \nO&M cost. The fiscal impact of domestic bank debt service and O&M cost on the JCG\u2019s fiscal \nbudget were estimated at 0.2%\u20131.5% in 2015\u20132019 and less than 0.1% from 2020 onwards, \nindicating that the JCG has enough financial capacity. The fiscal risk of the LMC is mitigated by \na loan assurance providing comprehensive fiscal support from the JCG to ensure smooth start-\nup of the LIP development. O&M costs of other subprojects will range from less than 0.1% to \n1.3% of projected revenues of operational entities in the first year of operation.14 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  The  BMG  handled  the  first  ADB  urban  sector  project  in  Gansu.  Procurement  and \nfinancial management capacity assessments concluded that the BMG has strong capacity to \nconduct procurement activities and financial management in accordance with ADB guidelines. \nThe  project  financial  management  arrangements  are  adequate.  Though  new  to  handling \nprojects  financed  by  international  financial  institutions,  all  implementing  agencies  are \nexperienced in managing construction and/or procuring goods for similar domestic projects. \nMoreover,  the  agencies  are gaining  adequate capacity for  both  procurement  and financial \nmanagement  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures  and  the  PRC\u2019s  national \nprocurement laws and regulations. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \nAccountability Mechanism Policy (2012) were explained to and discussed with the BMG and the \nfour  implementing  agencies.  The  BMG  and  its  project  management  office  are  transferring \nknowledge  and  experience  on  procurement,  public financial management,  and governance \nissues to the four implementing agencies through daily operations. A project management and \nprocurement specialist will be mobilized through advance contracting. An international tendering \nagency will be engaged before any advance procurement action. The project implementation \nconsulting service includes a contract management and procurement engineer and a financial \nspecialist to support the implementation. \n                                                \n14 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n21.  Gender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A \nsurvey and focus group discussions revealed that female respondents support the project as it \nwill generate job opportunities locally for them and for family members who are currently migrant \nworkers. Focus group discussions also found that women are interested in gaining skills through \ntraining  that  will  provide  them  with  better  nonfarming  employment  opportunities,  and  they \nconsidered improvements in traffic safety and access to better public transport service as \nimportant benefits that will enhance their quality of life. A gender action plan includes specific \ntargets for women in employment, vocational training, and participation that have been assured \nby the government. Women will be provided with (i) job opportunities during and after project \nimplementation; (ii) at least one dedicated TVET short-term training course; (iii) training or \neducation on labor law, labor protection, and labor security program; and (iv) opportunities to \nparticipate in community management and decision-making processes.15 \n \n22.  The enterprises attracted to the LIP will generate about 77,000 job opportunities and \n8,300 jobs will be created in the services sector; 30% of these jobs will be made available to the \npoor.16 The LIP infrastructure development subproject will directly benefit people who will live \nand work in the LIP. About 87,000 rural people and 6,000 urban people of Jingyuan county are \nexpected  to  benefit  from  the  TVET  subproject  through  increased  access  to  training  and \nemployment opportunities in various sectors. The TVET subproject will also improve livelihoods \nof  communities  impacted  by  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  as  a  result  of  the  LIP \ndevelopment. In addition, the ITS subproject will directly benefit 276,500 people who live in the \narea covered by the system by providing safe and better public transport services. A social \ndevelopment  action  plan  was  prepared  and  will  be  implemented  in  collaboration  with  key \nstakeholders during project implementation. A resettlement and social development specialist \nunder the project management consulting service will monitor and report the progress of the \nsocial development action plan and gender action plan, and results will be verified by the \nexternal monitor.17 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n23.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  including \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), was prepared based on three domestic environmental \nimpact assessments prepared for the infrastructure components, and a planning environmental \nimpact  assessment  prepared  for  the  LIP.  The  IEE  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) and was disclosed on the ADB website.18 It confirms that construction-phase \nimpacts will be localized and short term and can be effectively mitigated through application of \ngood construction practices and implementation of health and safety risk management plans \ndefined in the EMP. Significant earthworks, which will disturb surface soils and could affect \nsurface water in the project area, can be mitigated by adherence to the measures defined in the \nwater and soil conservation plan. Dust and noise control will address the concerns of nearby \nresidents during project implementation and operational phases. The sustainability of water \nextraction from regional water resources was confirmed through regional water balance analysis \nof the Yellow River and its water allocation plan. The effluent from the wastewater treatment \n                                                \n15  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  As of June 2013, seven industries had moved into the LIP. The LMC had also signed with four additional \nindustries. \n17  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nThe social development action plan is included in the project administration manual. \n18  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nplant will be reused for landscape irrigation and industrial processes, contributing to increased \nresilience to climate variability and future climate change. The ISO 14001-certified EMS will \nensure  the  environmental  management  and  emergency  response  capacity  of  the  LIP  and \nminimize environmental risks within the LIP during the operational phase. The BMG will be \nresponsible for the overall implementation and compliance with the EMP, including inspection, \nmonitoring,  reporting,  and  corrective  actions  or  measures.  Environmental  management  is \nsupported  by  loan  assurances  and  capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening \nactivities  under  the  project.  The  BMG  conducted  meaningful  consultation  with  potentially \naffected  people  and  project  beneficiaries.  Environmental  complaints  will  be  handled  in \naccordance with the grievance redress mechanism developed for the project. The project\u2019s \noutstanding environmental feature is the development of the EMS for the LIP, which is attached \nto the IEE. It will ensure a sustainable environmental path for LIP development. \n \n24.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will occupy 1,158.3 mu of state-\nowned  land,  acquire  397.7  mu  of  collectively  owned  land,  and  demolish  houses  of  35 \nhouseholds with 156 people.19 Sixty-seven rural households and 337 people will be significantly \naffected by the land acquisition and house relocation. Temporary land occupation of 155 mu will \naffect 46 rural households and 243 people. A resettlement plan was prepared in line with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, approved by ADB, disclosed to the affected people, and uploaded \nto the ADB website on 16 June 2014. The resettlement plan will be finalized in line with detailed \nengineering  design  and  detailed  measurement  survey,  disclosed  to  affected  people,  and \nsubmitted to ADB for approval. Compensation for lost assets and resettlement allowances will \nbe paid to affected people, and livelihood rehabilitation will be arranged in accordance with the \nresettlement plan. A due diligence report, prepared as an appendix of the resettlement plan, \nreviewed the collective land acquisition for the project completed in August 2012 and November \n2013. Implementation of the resettlement plan will be monitored and evaluated internally and \nexternally. Reflecting the first ADB project experience, the BMG will have, and cause the LMC \nto have, full-time staff members responsible for land acquisition and resettlement who will \nensure  compliance  with  ADB safeguards  requirements  and  regularly report  implementation \nprogress  through  periodic  progress  reports  to  ADB.  The  external  monitor  will  review  the \nprogress and general welfare of affected people to assess whether they have fully regained \ntheir standard of living. Monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared semiannually during \nimplementation and annually for 2 years after resettlement has been completed. They will be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  and  publicly  disclosed.  The  project  has  also  established  a  transparent \ngrievance redress mechanism that will provide meaningful consultation and trigger remedial \naction. \n \n25.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project has no negative effect on the ethnic \nminority  as  there  is  no  concentrated  area  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area.  Ethnic \nminorities are scattered in all residential quarters and 1.8% of the total municipal population is \nethnic minorities, primarily Hui minority. They will enjoy the benefits created by the project the \nsame way as the Han people. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n19   A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.7 square meters). \n20  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLate appropriation of  The BMG caused the JCG and LMC to agree with their banks to issue \ndomestic bank loan may  commitment letters of the domestic bank loan for counterpart funds. \ndelay project  The domestic bank loan will not be allocated for resettlement and land \nimplementation  acquisition costs to avoid any start-up delay of the project. \nThe PMC will conduct financial management training for the BMG and JCG. \nFour implementing  The BMG will engage a start-up project management and procurement \nagencies lack  specialist.

ASSURANCES \n \n27.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. The government has also agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n28.
