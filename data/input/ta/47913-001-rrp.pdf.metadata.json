I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan of up to $50 million, (ii) a proposed equity investment of up to $20 million, (iii) a proposed  \nB  loan  of  up  to  $30  million,  and  (iv)  a  proposed  political  risk  guarantee  (PRG)  of  up  to  \n$20 million for the Yangon Urban Renewal and District Cooling Project in Myanmar.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Myanmar is currently experiencing dynamic economic growth as it implements ongoing \npolitical and economic reforms in its transition to a more democratic system and liberalized \neconomy. It is also experiencing a rapid influx of business and tourism as the country opens as \nan appealing new destination for investment and attractions. However, the steady increase of \ninternational visitors is currently overwhelming Yangon, the country\u2019s largest commercial city \nand transit hub, due to the surge in demand for basic tourism and business infrastructure such \nas  hotel  rooms,  long-term  accommodation,  and  office  space.  Chronic  underinvestment  in \ntourism and business infrastructure has left the city with an inadequate and insufficient supply of \nworking and living spaces. The severe shortage of basic infrastructure in Yangon is a growing \nimpediment to economic growth, job creation, and foreign investment. The country requires an \nestimated $146 billion in urban infrastructure investment for its large cities during 2010\u20132030; of \nthis, almost 60% is required for residential housing ($87 billion) and more than 10% ($17 billion) \nfor commercial space.2 \n \n3.  The  project  comprises  the  revitalization  of  an  emerging  central  business  district, \nincluding hotel, retail, office, and residential space; and a district cooling plant and network to \nserve the locality. The overall development will also restore and preserve a prominent heritage \nbuilding that will become a significant feature of the project site.3 The project will be the first \nproject finance transaction under the new Foreign Investment Law, and is identified by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) as a priority to help \nreduce the acute supply shortage in Yangon, stimulate business and tourism activity, and set a \nprecedent for international standards in the sector. The commercial lending market in Myanmar \nis at a nascent stage as local and international banks are unable to finance large and complex \nprojects without multilateral assistance. This project places ADB and IFC at the forefront of \nundertaking  the  first  international  project  financing  in  Myanmar  under  the  new  foreign \ninvestment law. The project\u2019s demonstration effects will help commercial banks gain confidence \nin the Myanmar market and set a blueprint for financiers to replicate and advance similar \ndevelopments. Because Yangon is a crucial engine for generating economic growth and jobs, \nthe  development  of  a  competitive,  equitable,  and  environmentally  sustainable  city  through \nprojects such as this one is a strategic priority for the country.  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  McKinsey Global Institute. 2013. Myanmar\u2019s Moment: Unique Opportunities, Major Challenges. New York.  \n3  Cultural and historic heritage sites are often at risk during rapid and unplanned economic expansion. Yangon\u2019s \ninvaluable heritage buildings are at risk from long decades of neglect and, more pressingly, now from a new wave \nof commercial development that threatens century-old buildings in the downtown area that are being demolished \nwith  alarming  speed.  The  overall  development  includes  the  restoration  and  adaptive  reuse  of  the  former \nheadquarters of the British Burma Railway Company, a Victorian building built in 1877 that is currently in a \ndilapidated state. While the restoration will not be part of the ADB and IFC investment and financing, it will be an \nintegral part of the project site and an important element through shared infrastructure and synergies with the \nproject.  ", "2 \n \n4.  The  concentration  of  business  and  tourism  activity  in  Yangon  will  put  increasing \npressure on public utilities and the environment. Yangon has a hot tropical monsoon climate in \nwhich daytime temperatures hover around 30\u00b0C. Accordingly, air conditioning is an expensive \nnecessity for businesses and tourism, and accounts for a significant percentage of electricity \nconsumption, especially during peak periods. The project will include the country\u2019s first district \ncooling plant, which will provide sustainable, efficient, reliable, and essential cooling services. \nThe plant will use state-of-the-art technology to significantly reduce electricity consumption for \ncooling compared with conventional air conditioning. The plant will help reduce the strain on \nYangon\u2019s electrical grid, reduce power plant fuel consumption, provide cost savings to end-\nusers, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n2.  The Borrower and Sponsor \n5.  Mee Ya Hta International Hotel (MIHL) will be the counterparty under the master lease \nwith  MRT.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n21.  The project is classified as category B for environment. The borrower has prepared an \ninitial environmental examination to cover all aspects of the project following the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The initial environmental examination includes an environmental and \nsocial  management  plan  to  adequately  address  potential  impacts  during  construction  and \noperation, such as noise, dust, water quality and quantity, solid and liquid waste, hazardous \nwaste, exposure of workers to occupational health and safety hazards, and cultural heritage \nconservation. The borrower is developing internal risk management procedures and assigning a \ndirector of risk management and compliance to be responsible for overall environmental and \nsocial  risk  management.  To  minimize  and  mitigate  potential  impacts,  the  project  will  be \ndesigned, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements, the World Bank Group\u2019s general environmental, health, and safety \nguidelines, and national environment laws and regulations. \n  \n22.  The  project  is classified  as  category  C for  involuntary  resettlement and  indigenous \npeoples. The 3.9-hectare project site is located in the city core of Yangon on land belonging to \nMRT. The site has been leased to the borrower since 1993, and the project is not expected to \nhave involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples impacts. The due diligence confirms that \n(i)  no  informal  settlers  or  vendors  use  the  project  area,  and  (ii)  the  project  area  and \nsurroundings  have  no  record  of  settlements  of  ethnic  groups  or  indigenous  peoples.  The \nexisting structures on the site are (i) Myanmar Railway Building, (ii) FMI Centre, (iii) Grand Mee \nYa Hta Executive Residence, (iv) Zawygyi House, and (v) two abandoned residential buildings. \nWith the exception of Myanmar Railway Building, which will be architecturally restored and \nconverted to a boutique hotel, the other buildings will be demolished. Grand Mee Ya Hta ", "  5 \nExecutive  Residence  was  vacated  in  October  2013.  FMI  Centre  (office  and  commercial \ncomplex) and Zawygyi House (restaurant) will be vacated in early 2016, after providing at least \n6-month notice to existing tenants. The borrower engaged stakeholders in the surrounding \ncommunities  during the  project  design.  A grievance  redress mechanism to  address  public \ncomplaints is in place. Consultations carried out as part of the initial environmental examination \ndid not identify any outstanding grievances.  \n \n23.  During construction, civil work contractors are expected to provide work opportunities for \n2,500 local community residents. During operation, significant employment opportunities will be \ncreated for local residents in the offices and commercial establishments. In addition, about 900 \nstaff, expected to be mostly local, will be employed in the hotels and serviced apartments. The \nproject  is  classified  as  having  some  gender  elements,  and  the  borrower  will  work  toward \nincorporating the following measures in the project: (i) prioritize hiring of women for 40% of the \njobs created in hospitality and retail, and (ii) impart skill training programs to locally hired staff in \nhospitality areas with at least 40% participation of women. The borrower (and its contractors) \ncommits to comply with the ADB Social Protection Strategy (2001) covering the internationally \nrecognized core labor standards and national labor laws.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n24.  Myanmar  is  a  jurisdiction  with  strategic  anti-money  laundering  and  combating  the \nfinancing  of  terrorism  deficiencies,  and  therefore  the  borrower  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s \nAntiCorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), and policy relating to the Combating of \nMoney Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003).  Consistent with its commitment to \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  that  the  borrower  institute, \nmaintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice \nstandards for the purpose of preventing corruption and money-laundering activities and the \nfinancing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. \n \nC.
