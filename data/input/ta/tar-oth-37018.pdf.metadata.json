The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Natural Gas Project envisages the construction \nof a natural-gas transmission pipeline of about 1,700 kilometers to transport about 30 billion \ncubic meters of gas annually from the Dauletabad gas fields in southeast Turkmenistan to \nconsumers in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and, possibly, India. The cost of the project is estimated at \nabout $3.3 billion. Project implementation will take about 5 years, after the cooperating countries \nand  other  partners  finally  agree  on  project  design,  operating  parameters,  and  contractual \nagreements. The heads of state of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan met in Islamabad \non 29\u201330 May 2002, and decided to cooperate on project implementation. A steering committee \nconsisting of the oil and gas ministers from the three countries was established to follow up and \nsupervise project development. \n \n2.  At its first meeting on 9\u201310 July 2002 at Ashgabat, the steering committee requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to be a development partner and to grant a regional technical \nassistance (TA) for various project-related studies. ADB agreed to finance a techno-economic \nfeasibility  study  to  cover  pipeline  routing,  preliminary  design,  cost  estimates,  and  rapid \nenvironmental impact assessment, and to assess volume-price sensitivity.1 ADB also agreed to \ncarry out a market study on demand for natural gas in Pakistan and northern India, and a risk \nanalysis and risk mitigation study on concerns of gas-consuming countries and of consumers in \ncase gas supply is disrupted along its route.2  \n \n3.  The  proposed  TA 3  is  a  follow-up  of  the  recommendations  of  the  latter  study. \nUnderground reservoirs are proposed to be built in Pakistan to store sufficient quantities of \nnatural gas to meet unforeseen disruptions and shortages. Fact-finding was carried out on 16 \u2013\n17 September. A number of activities still need to be carried out to complete the project study. \nThe three countries have to finalize the draft model host government agreement (HGA), gas \nsale and purchase agreement (GSPA), and transportation agreement. Bids will be solicited from \nprivate companies interested in joining the consortium that will build and operate the pipeline. \nSolicitation will be done through advertising in international oil and gas and other trade journals. \nRoad shows and seminars will disseminate information about the project among international oil \nand gas and major pipeline companies. Legal advice will also be required to formalize the \nvarious agreements between the governments and consortium. \n \n4.  The project could significantly boost the economies of the countries involved, and \nenhance stability and improve living standards in Central and South Asia. The project is a \npioneering  effort  to  link  the  gas-rich  Central  Asian  economies  with  the  energy-deficient \neconomies of South Asia. The project is also the first attempt to find an outlet for natural gas \nfrom Central Asia to new markets in East. However, project realization faces significant political \nand technical challenges. The steering committee has met six times, and the participating \ncountries have exhibited a strong spirit of cooperation and determination to advance the project. \nThe  TA  reflects  the  essence  of  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  regional  cooperation.  As  an  active \ndevelopment partner, ADB will help mobilize technical expertise and financial resources. \n \n                                                 \n1  The consultants have submitted the draft feasibility report for TA 6066-REG (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance fo \nthe Feasibility Studies of the Turkmenistan \u2013 Afghanistan \u2013 Pakistan Naturla Gas Pipeline Project. Manila). The \ndraft report is being reviewed by ADB and the three governments. The study indicates that even if Pakistan were \nthe only buyer of the gas, the project would still be financially and economically viable.  \n2  The studies were approved at the fourth and fifth steering committee meetings in February and April 2003. \n3  The TA was listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 September 2003. ", "2 \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  If relations between the countries deteriorate, a country upstream of the pipeline system \nmight deliberately disrupt gas supply to downstream countries, causing major economic losses.  \n \n6.  The  pipeline  will  pass  through  the  southeastern  part  of  Turkmenistan  to  southern \nAfghanistan (Herat-Kandahar) to Quetta and on to Multan and Pakpattan in Pakistan. The \nburied pipeline or other pipeline infrastructure facilities could be sabotaged by unlawful elements \nin Afghanistan or on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The Government of Pakistan, therefore, \nneeds assurance that gas supply will not be disrupted in such an event. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s risk mitigation study suggested the following measures to counter deliberate \nsupply disruptions: \n \n(i)  A  contractual  provision  in  the  gas  sales  and  purchase  agreement  could  bind \nTurkmenistan  and  the  pipeline  consortium  to  suspend  deliveries  to  Afghanistan \nand/or Pakistan in case of supply disruption until the damaged facilities have been \nrepaired. \n(ii)  The countries could have cross-holdings in subsidiary pipeline companies as well as \nend-user companies in each other\u2019s territories.   \n(iii)  Standby storage facilities of natural gas could be arranged in Pakistan to continue \ngas supply for, say, about two weeks,  thus allowing the disruptive issue to be \nresolved or alternate fuel supplies to be arranged. \n \n8.  Gas  demand  in  Pakistan,  particularly  in  the  north,  is  subject  to  major  seasonal \nvariations. During the winter (for about three months), gas supply for power generation and \nindustrial use is severely curtailed because of increased demand for domestic space heating. \nThe situation is further aggravated by reduced hydropower generation. Underground storage \nwould help mitigate such shortages. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  Depleted and partly depleted reservoirs, typically sandstone and limestone, may be \nsuitable for storage of natural gas as in the United States and Europe. Gas stored in this \nmanner is normally used for peak shaving operations and as a buffer in case of interruption of \ngas production and/or of the transmission system upstream from the gas storage facilities. \n  \n10.  The TA will consist of (i) part A\u2014a study on gas storage in Pakistan, and (ii) part B\u2014\nadvisory services to finalize the various project agreements and disseminate project information \namong major oil and gas and gas transportation companies. \n \n11.  Under part A, a techno-economic feasibility study will identify reservoirs (depleted oil and \ngas fields and salt caverns) in Pakistan most suitable for storing natural gas to cater to seasonal \ndemand fluctuations and for emergency use in case project pipeline supply is disrupted. The TA \nwill be implemented in two stages. In the first, possible reservoirs will be selected to limit the \nnumber of reservoirs to be studied in greater detail during the second stage. In the second \nstage, a study will be conducted of reservoir characteristics, injection and/or extraction facilities, \nrequired  gas  injection/production  facilities,  connection  to  existing  and  proposed  gas \ninfrastructure (including the project pipeline system), and estimated cost and time to ready these ", "    3 \nreservoirs. The scope of work for stage 2 will depend on the results of  stage 1. Two or three of \nthe most promising reservoirs will be compared. The feasibility study will also examine the \npossibility of using a combination of smaller reservoirs, in different locations, for their optimum \nintegration with existing and planned gas infrastructure.  \n \n12.  Under part B, the three draft agreements (para. 2) will be reviewed, discussed in detail \nwith the three governments, and finalized. Bids will be solicited from major oil and gas/pipeline \ncompanies, and the most suitable will be selected to lead the consortium.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Part A: Gas Storage Study \n \n13.  Stage 1 of part A will focus on assessing the following reservoir characteristics: \n \n(i)  Size. The reservoir needs to be uniform and large enough to hold the required \nworking volume of cushion gas. \n(ii)  Containment. This is the reservoir\u2019s ability to store gas without incurring losses \nor causing contamination of the gas. \n(iii)  Well productivity.  The required volume of gas should be produced from the \nreservoir using existing facilities. \n(iv)  Location and distance.  The technical feasibility and financial and economic \nviability of the reservoir for gas storage should be determined vis-\u00e0-vis the \nlocation of the gas transmission system and other gas infrastructure facilities \n(including the project pipeline system). \n \n14.  Stage 2 of part A will entail detailed evaluation of short-listed reservoirs, using the \nfollowing  criteria:  geology  and  size,  lithology  and  reservoir  characterization,  porosity, \npermeability, gas initially in place, gas water contact (if any), well productivity, historic reservoir \nperformance, reservoir pressure development, and reserves. Gas compression facilities, and \nother ancillary systems/facilities required to integrate the selected reservoirs with the gas \ninfrastructure,  will  also  be  evaluated.  Cost  estimates  and  an  implementation  schedule  to \ndevelop and integrate these reservoirs will be prepared. Environmental issues associated with \nthe reservoirs will be identified and assessed. \n \n2.  Part B: Advisory Services \n \n15.  Lawyers will be engaged to help the three governments finalize the HGA and the GSPA. \nTo facilitate bid solicitation and disseminate information and relevant details of the project, it will \nbe advertised in international magazines and promoted in road shows.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total TA cost is estimated at $825,000. ADB will cover the foreign exchange costs of \n$690,000 and local currency costs of $10,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  will  provide  $125,000 \nequivalent for office accommodation, transport, support services, and counterpart staff for part \nA. TA cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n ", "4 \n17.  Any computer programs, databases, and other information developed by the consultants \nwill  be  provided  to  the  steering  committee,  Government  of  Pakistan,  and  ADB  upon  TA \ncompletion. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the TA Executing Agency for the TA. Under ADB\u2019s supervision, Pakistan\u2019s \nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural Resources will be the Implementing Agency for part A, and \nthe steering committee for part B. \n \n19.  The TA will require 12 person-months of input for part A by a firm of international \nconsultants to be selected using the simplified technical proposal procedure and quality- and \ncost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe consultant will have expertise in reservoir studies and geology, and conceptual and front-\nend engineering design for gas storage using depleted oil/gas reservoirs; and experience in \nfunctionality  regarding  working  volumes,  deliverability,  injectivity  in  oil/gas  fields  and  salt \ncaverns, and reservoir/petroleum engineering, notably field development and management of \nhigh-pressure gas pipeline and gas treatment facilities. Three person-months of individual \ninternational  consultancy  will  be  required  to  coordinate  the  work  among  all  stakeholders, \nincluding the three governments and their various agencies, particularly with respect to Pakistan \nand its gas sector agencies. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  To help the three governments finalize the model HGA, GSPA, and transportation \nagreement  under  part  B,  an  international  firm  of  lawyers  with  expertise  in  large  natural \ngas/pipeline projects will be engaged in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel.  \n \n21.  The HGA will grant and guarantee the pipeline consortium the rights and concessions it \nneeds to implement the project, in return for which the government will receive a transit fee. \nUnder the GSPA the gas off-taker will agree to buy, and the supplier agree to supply, the gas, \nwhich  is  to  pass  through  the  pipeline.  Under  the  transportation  agreement  the  pipeline \nconsortium  will  agree  to  transport  gas  for  the  buyer  (or  the  seller),  which  will  receive  a \ntransportation fee (or tariff) in return.  \n \n22.  The TA is expected to begin in March 2004 and be completed by October 2004. For part \nA, the international consultant will submit an inception report in one month after appointment. A \ndraft final report will be submitted for review of all stakeholders and ADB within 6 months of the \ninception mission. The final report will be submitted within a month of receipt of comments and \nafter taking into account the comments on the draft final report. All the reports will be presented \nto the steering committee. Ten copies each in Russian and Dari will be prepared separately for \nthe use of Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. Under part B, the law firm will finalize and present to \nthe steering committee a set of final agreements (HGA, GSPA, and transportation agreement) \nby June 2004.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Natural Gas Pipeline Project (Phase II), and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n       \n(i)  Encourage  Ensured availability  Reports by the project   \nstorage of  of natural gas for 10\u2013 consortium and reports \nnatural gas to  15 days in case of  by gas companies \nsecure its  disruption to pipeline   \nsupply and     \nmitigate the risk  Increased supply of   \nof supply  gas during winter   Reports by the project \ndisruption or  consortium and reports \nshortages when  by gas companies \ndemand peaks   \n \nPurpose       \n       \nIdentify the most  Appropriate size,  TA study as confirmed  Availability of adequate \nsuitable reservoirs  containment well,  by the steering  data \nproductivity, and  committee and Asian   \nlocation  Development Bank  Existence of suitable \n  (ADB) review missions  reservoirs \n \nOutputs       \n       \nStudy and locate  Techno-economic  ADB review missions  Continued commitment of \nsuitable reservoirs to  feasibility study    the Government of \nstore natural gas in two  acceptable to all  Consultants\u2019 periodic  Pakistan to provide all \nphases:  partners  reports  data/assistance for the \n(i) Prepare a long-list      study \nof all available       \nreservoirs        \n(ii) Short-list the most       \nsuitable reservoirs       \nfor the study       \n       \nAgreements finalized  Acceptance by all  Review by staff  Agreement between the \nbetween the  governments of the    governments \ngovernments,  agreements      \nconsortium, and gas     \nsellers and buyers      \n     \nExpressions of interest  Expressions of  Review by staff \nreceived from private  interest received    \nsector     \n     \n     \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nProject information  Number of road  Review by staff \ndisseminated  shows and seminars \n  held \n \nActivities       \n       \nLocate the reservoirs  Arrangements to  ADB review missions  Continued commitment of \n  make the reservoir    the GOP to provide all \nDetermine the most  functional in the  Consultants\u2019 periodic  data/assistance for the \nefficient ways to use  shortest time  reports  study \nthe reservoirs  possible     \n       \nEstimate time and  Establishment of     \ncosts  economic and     \n  financial rates of     \n  return     \n       \nEngage the  Finalization of  As above  Adequate interest from \ngovernments to finalize  agreements    governments and \nthe agreements      investors \n     \nIssue advertisements  Publishing of   \nto solicit interest  advertisements   \n     \nConduct road shows  Holding of road   \nand seminars  shows   \n   \nInputs       \n       \nConsulting services  International  ADB review missions,  Capable consultants \n  consulting services  periodic reports, review   \n  for 15 person-months  meetings   \n     \n     \nCosts  Estimated total cost   \n  $825,000 equivalent,   \n  including $135,000 in   \n  local currency   \n    Availability of counterpart \nFinancing  ADB financing of  funds \n$700,000 and \nGovernment of \nPakistan contribution \nof $125,000 ", "  Appendix 2  7 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ \u2018000) \n \n \nForeign  Local  Total \nItem \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Part A: Gas Storage Study \n \n1.  The study will be conducted by an international consulting company, which will provide \n12 person-months of services. It will carry out all investigations to estimate costs, feasibility, \nwork  over,  new  facilities,  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  for  the  Pakistan \nunderground gas storage (UGS) project based on depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. \n \n1.  Scope of Work under Stage 1 \n2.  Endorsed  by  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources,  the  most  suitable \nreservoirs will be selected and used for the Pakistan UGS. Field selection will depend on the \npipeline route through Afghanistan (north or south) selected to build the pipeline. The consultant \nwill do the following: \n \n(i)  Review the reservoirs available, list all the reservoirs examined, and short-list \nthem, ranking them according to suitability for UGS functionality, using as criteria \ncontainment,  reservoir  size,  well  productivity,  and  distance  to  project \ninfrastructure.  \n(ii)  Investigate how existing and planned infrastructure can be best used in relation \nto UGS and market location. \n(iii)  Define the magnitude and timing of the winter service gas load in the medium \nterm to meet peak shaving and security requirements. \n(iv)  Review the extent to which interruptible gas contracts may induce industrial fuel \nusers to shift from gas to other fuels during supply interruptions and peak load \nseason. \n(v)  Report on the selection of reservoirs most suitable for UGS and examine the \nfeasibility of connecting them to the project pipeline systems. Two or three of the \nmost promising candidate fields will be compared. Alternatively, the potential and \ncomparative advantages of developing two smaller reservoirs for gas storage \nmay be investigated. The objective is to develop an optimum proposal for UGS. \n \n2.  Scope of Work under Stage 2 \n3.  The consultant will prepare a feasibility report on conversion to UGS of the selected \nfields and estimate its cost. The feasibility study will cover (i) reservoir aspects, (ii) injection \nand/or  extraction  facilities,  (iii)  connections  to  the  project  and  national  gas  transmission \nsystems,  (iv)  environmental  aspects  of  the  reservoirs  and  their  related  facilities,  (v) \nimplementation schedule, and (vi) cost estimates. \n \na.  Reservoir Aspects \n4.  The suitability of fields selected will be based on UGS functionality requirements, using \nanalysis of geological, geophysical, and petro-physical data; well data; production and test data; \nexisting reservoir reports; and field studies. \n \n5.  The  reservoir  aspects  to  be  addressed  include  (i)  reservoir  geometry  and  size, \n(ii) containment and leakage risks, (iii) lithology and reservoir characterization, (iv) porosity,  \n(v) permeability, (vi) fluid contacts, (vii) compartmentalization, (viii) gas initially in place, (ix) well ", "  Appendix 3  9 \nproductivity,  (x)  historic  reservoir  performance,  (xi)  reservoir  pressure  development,  and \n(xii) material balance. \n \n6.  Containment is critical to determine the suitability of a depleted gas field for UGS. \nContainment is the reservoir\u2019s ability to store and handle gas with little loss or harm to public \nhealth  and  safety  and  the  environment.  Although  the  gas  fields  have  a  proven  retention \ncapability, their long- term containment integrity for UGS will have to be critically reviewed. \n \n7.  For each selected reservoir the study will establish a likely optimum configuration for \nUGS duty based on defined UGS functionality, including number and type of wells (horizontal \nand/or vertical or tubing diameter); amount of cushion gas required; maximum permissible \npressure;  and  minimum  operating  pressure.  Associated  risks  and  uncertainties  will  be \nhighlighted. \n \nb.   Injection and Extraction Facilities \n8.  The consultant will investigate how many existing wells are suitable for UGS. For new \nwells the optimum type (tubing diameter, horizontal and/or vertical) will be identified. \n \n9.  Gas Compression into Storage. A compressor station at the UGS will be derived and \nsized  to  compress  gas  from  project  pipeline  pressure  to  storage  injection  pressure.  The \ncompressor station will be modular so that its throughput can be increased in line with gas off-\ntake from the project. \n \n10.  Gas Conditioning Out of Storage. Gas extracted from storage will be saturated with \nwater and possible heavier hydrocarbons under UGS reservoir conditions. It will also need to \nhave its pressure reduced suitably for pipeline operation and conditioned to depress the water \nand hydrocarbon dew points and reduce impurities. Any requirement for gas compression from \nstorage into the transmission system will be assessed. \n \n11.  Gas Metering. Gas to storage will be subject to fiscal metering at the off-take from the \nproject and at the output points from storage, either into the Pakistan gas distribution system or \nback into the project for onward transmission to India, or both. \n \n12.  Gas consumption associated with UGS operation will also be metered for internal \naccounting purposes. \n \nc.  Ancillary Systems \n13.  UGS will be supported by its own operating infrastructure and will be connected to the \ncontrol center for the project pipeline, the Sui control center, and the center to be developed to \nmeet Indian gas demand. \n \nd.  Connection of the Gas Transmission System \n14.  UGS will be connected to the project pipeline on its alignment along the selected route \nwith important cities that are in reasonably close through spur lines. The spur line will be sized \nto transport gas at the maximum flow rate determined for input into storage. \n \n15.  The Sui Southern Gas Company has a hydraulic model of the Sui southern and the \nnorthern gas pipeline network in Pipeline Studio\u2019s bureau package program, TGNET. The gas \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \ncompany will make the updated model, including planned network developments up to 2020, \navailable to the consultant. The consultant will use the model to assess its capacity to transport \noutput gas flows from UGS to the Pakistan gas market. An optimum solution for UGS output gas \nconnections to the existing network will be derived and sized with all de-bottlenecking, facilities, \nreversal of flow, etc. \n \n16.  Depending  on  the  characteristics  of  the  Pakistan  gas  distribution  system  and  its \nenhancements, the study will look into the possibility of reconnecting output gas to India. \nTherefore, the spur line will be sized for the maximum outflow of gas from storage.  \n \ne.  System Construction \n \n17.  The consultant will assess the engineering and equipment requirements to accommodate \nrequired injection and withdrawal rates. The consultant will assess these rates for the selected \nreservoirs.  \n \n3.  Project Management \n \n18.  Proper project management is imperative for efficient construction and operation of the \nPakistan  UGS.  The  international  consultant  will  develop  a  detailed  project  implementation \nschedule, estimate costs, and identify bid packages for the entire system. The work schedule will \nbe of level-1 (\u00b1 30%) network type and be in sufficient detail to permit monitoring of individual \nactivities. The overall cost estimate will have an accuracy of \u00b1 30%. From his or her design, the \ninternational consultant will tabulate material and construction costs for the following facilities: \n \n(i)  construction  costs\u2014wells  (worked  over  and  new),  compressor  stations,  gas \nconditioning plant, meter stations, pipelines, control system, and other facilities \nas required; and  \n(ii)  operating costs\u2014labor, transportation, maintenance and spare parts, fuel gas, \ninsurance, and management costs. \n \n  4.  Environmental Analysis \n \n19.  The consultant will undertake the following: \n \n(i)  Identify and assess environmental issues associated with the natural gas storage \nreservoirs. \n(ii)  Prepare an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and summary EIA or initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) and summary IEE report based on ADB\u2019s 2003 \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines as appropriate. \n \n5.  Economic Analysis \n \n20.  The consultant will undertake the following: \n \n(i)  Estimate  the  financial  capital  and  operating  costs  and  carry  out  least-cost, \nviability, and distributional analysis of the project, including sensitivity analysis \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects using a net \npresent value approach based on a discounted cash-flow analysis to assess the \ncomparative economic advantage of the project. ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n(ii)  Undertake economic benefit-cost analysis to confirm the overall viability of the \nproject in terms of economic internal rates of return as per ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects. \n(iii)  Assess the uncertainties and risks facing the project, and carry out sensitivity \nanalyses to check its viability under adverse conditions. \n(iv)  Evaluate the project\u2019s direct and indirect environmental impacts and carry out an \neconomic analysis of these impacts in terms of net present value and internal \nrates of return in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Economic Evaluation of \nEnvironmental Impacts.  \n \n6.  Financial Analysis \n \n21.   The international consultant will undertake the following: \n \n(i)  Prepare detailed project design cost estimates in ADB format based on 2004 \nprices  expressed  in  foreign  exchange,  including  appropriate  provisions  for \nphysical contingency, price escalation, and interest during construction. \n(ii)  Assess  the  financial  feasibility  and  performance  of  the  project,  prepare \nappropriate financial statements in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for the \nPreparation and Presentation of Financial Analysis, and undertake benefit-cost \nanalysis to compute the financial internal rate of return for individual investment \ncomponents. \n(iii)  Undertake sensitivity analyses for the financial evaluation of all components, \nconsidering key factors that could affect their viability. \n \n7.  Project Viability \n \n22.
