Key Development Issues to be addressed:  \nIndonesia has witnessed robust economic growth above 4.5% p.a. over the decade since 2002 and expects a \ncontinued strong growth trajectory in the coming years. Associated with this growth the Government of Indonesia \n(GOI) estimates a surge in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from an annual 362 million tons carbon dioxide \nequivalent (MtCO e) in 2006 to 980 MtCO e in 2020 in a business as usual scenario.3 This surge may be contained \n2 2\nby up to 270 MtCO e p.a. by 2020 if advanced power generation technology and energy efficiency measures are \n2\napplied. In 2009 Indonesia announced a plan to reduce GHGs by 41% in 2020, of which 26% would be stemmed \nthrough own efforts and 15% through international support. The CTF Investment Plan (IP) for Indonesia, endorsed \nin March 2010, forms part of the international effort. Under the IP, ADB has an investment allocation of US$ 50 \nmillion from the CTF to be co-invested with ADB in supporting financial sector investments in energy efficiency (EE) \nand renewable energy (RE).   \nThe CTF IP prioritizes investments in: (i) RE power generation through geothermal, biomass, small hydropower, \nsolar, and wind resources; (ii) improving EE especially in heavy industries including cogeneration and cleaner \nproduction, and (iii) improved EE in existing and new commercial and residential buildings.  \nWhile in-depth discussion with private companies confirmed the large potential4 for EE improvements in industries \nand buildings as well as RE investments in biomass and small hydropower, the Indonesian banking sector5 has so \nfar not undertaken a systematic effort in developing products and solutions for facilitating such investment. Banks in \nIndonesia de facto follow opportunities identified by their corporate clients rather than leading the way. Indonesia \nhas the lowest retail electricity prices in South East Asia which lowers the attractiveness of EE investments through \nlonger payback periods. Availability of long term domestic currency capital is short in supply and foreign currency \ncapital is associated with substantial foreign exchange rate volatility risks. While some efforts are ongoing to build \ncapacity of banks and financial institutions the Indonesian financial sector as a whole has yet to recognize the \npotential of EE and RE investments as a business line.  \nIn the absence of direct banking and other financial sector intermediary initiatives supporting small and medium \nsized  EE  and  RE  investments  in  Indonesia,  ADB  has  started  identifying  private  firms  that  are  suitable  as \naggregators for such investments in Indonesia consistent with their core business orientation. Such firms include (a) \nproperty investors and managers of commercial and residential buildings seeking to build and retrofit EE through \nbuilding insulation and electrical management; and (b) engineering companies that work with (i) heavy industries in \nEE process reengineering, (ii) industrial producers and operators of RE power plants both for captive power \ngeneration and selling electricity to utilities which in include biomass, hydro and solar power generation. Despite low \nelectricity  tariffs  and  inefficiencies  of  power  utilities,  these  firms  have  emphasized  strong  demand  for  EE \ninvestments facilitating substantial energy cost savings and ensuring RE production on sites that may not have \naccess to Indonesia\u2019s electricity grid or currently rely entirely on fossil energy supplies. Local banks are more likely \nto identify EE and RE investment projects through such aggregators given their track record, relatively good credit \nrating,  and  the  economies  of  scale  involved  in  the  aggregation  process,  rather  than  directly  sourcing  such \ninvestments. \nThe Program aims to establish FI business lines through aggregators of private sector EE and RE investments by \nproviding critical assistance in the identification and structuring of such investments. Monetizing energy savings and \navoiding incremental energy costs would represent significant improvements to the current practice. Establishing \nand scaling up such business would provide a key contribution to Indonesia\u2019s transition into a low carbon economy. \nLacking direct initiatives by financial institutions, ADB has considered existing alternative funding structures that are \nexpected to be more efficient than executing individual transactions, or creating separate financing structures. \nADB identified the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF) a debt fund mandated to support the reduction of GHG \nemissions in developing countries through RE and EE investments. Core investors include KfW of Germany, the \nInternational Finance Corporation and Deutsche Bank, who also represents the investment manager. GCPF was \nincorporated in 2010 as a Luxembourg Investment Company with Variable Capital (SICAV) and is operating under \nthe supervision of the Luxemburg financial sector regulator (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). \n                                                 \n3  Business as usual means that no mitigation measures are utilized to contain the growth of emissions.  \n4  Various assessments estimate the potential EE and RE market at up to $10 billion in total investments. \n5  The state owned Indonesia Exim Bank is a notable exception. ADB currently supports an EE program linked to trade finance.  ", "GCPF  has  established  contractual  frameworks  for  investors  offering  investment  into  four  funding  tranches, \nsegregated by risk bearing capacity, as illustrated below. GCPF has an investment policy and risk management and \ngovernance  framework  approved  by  the  Luxembourg  regulator.  GCPF  has  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) in place that is consistent with IFC performance standards. It monitors environmental \nand social risks and mitigants and also monitors GHG emission impacts through a model developed by Deutsche \nBank. The ESMS is consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009. \n Source: Global Climate Partnership Fund \nIn addition to  KfW and IFC (who are invested in the mezzanine and senior tranches)  GCPF has obtained \ninvestments of the Danish and German Governments into the Junior (equity) Tranche. Deutsche Bank,6 the \nInvestment Manager has invested in the Mezzanine Tranche). GCPF is seeking other investors from private and \ninternational financial institutions and governments. GCPF has currently obtained commitments of USD 250 million \nand is targeting an overall fund size of USD 500 million.   \nWhile GCPF operates globally, the CTF funding can only be deployed in Indonesia. To ensure that the CTF funding \nwill be ring-fenced, the TA will conduct deal analysis, and establish funding structures and operational procedures \nthrough an Indonesia-specific business plan and related investment structures. ADB will consider an investment \ninto (i) GCPF or (ii) parallel to GCPF. A viable structure will be identified and developed through the TA.7  \n8.  TA Description: \na.  The TA will support the preparation and pipeline development that precede the investment by ADB and \nCTF with GCPF. This includes:   \n(i)  Part A - identification and evaluation of EE and RE investments in line with ADB\u2019s policies and CTF\u2019s \neligibility criteria and other requirements; and  \n(ii)  Part B \u2013 financial structuring of the CTF and ADB investment vehicle in or alongside GCPF. \nb.

The purpose of the TA is to develop a program of small to medium-sized private sector led \ninvestments, either directly or through financial institutions, in Indonesia that reduce greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions by at least 2.2 million tons of CO2e per annum by 2020 (compared with a \nbusiness  as  usual  scenario).  The  reduction  of  GHG  emissions  is  anchored  in  Indonesia\u2019s \ndevelopment plans and supported by the Clean Technology Fund\u2019s (CTF) Investment Plan for \nIndonesia approved in April 2010.1  \n2.  ADB intends to propose financing of (i) up to US$ 50 million from the ADB CTF2 and (ii) up \nto US$ 50 million of own resources3 into an Asia or Indonesia specific window of the Global Climate \nPartnership Fund  SICAV (GCPF)4  incorporated in Luxembourg  (The Program).  GCPF  itself  is \nanticipated to invest and additional up to US$ 50m for the Indonesia program. The outcome of the \nTA will be an investment proposal and related documentation for submission to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors. \nB.  Consulting Services5 \n3.  The scope of the consulting services will include:  \nPart A: Investment Identification and Structuring \n(i)  in  collaboration  with  GCPF  investment  manager,  identify  a  pipeline  of  small  to \nmedium-sized EE and RE projects (e.g., industry process improvements (waste heat \nrecovery), building retrofits and biomass cogeneration, hydro, wind, and solar power \ngeneration,) either through local financial institutions or directly. This should include \nestimating the quantum of GHG reductions and other development impacts that \ncould be achieved through the projects.   \n(ii)   identify  appropriate  financing  modalities  under  existing  market  conditions  for \nproviding support to local FIs or directly to investors for the identified project pipeline, \n(iii)  assess potential financing from other sources, including other local banks, bilateral \nagencies, other multilaterals, etc. \n(iv)  recommend  monitoring  and  reporting  mechanisms  for  GHG  emission  reductions \nthrough the program. \nPart B: Investment Finance Vehicle Structuring \n(i)  analyze GCPF\u2019s existing investment policies and guidelines6 and establish their fit for \nthe Program. Analyze ability of other identified FI vehicles (if any) that could be used \nfor the Program and compare with GCPF.  \n                                                 \n1   See: www.climatefundsupdate.org/listing/clean-technology-fund \n2  in the form of long-term debt and/or equity instruments \n3  in the form of long-term debt instruments \n4  See www://gcpf.lu/home.html \n5  The scope and terms of reference will be flexible to avoid duplication of ongoing efforts between GCPF, Deutsche  \nBank, and ADB.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe GCPF Indonesia Investment Program will promote the use of renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) \ninvestments to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Although not targeted to poverty reduction the anticipated private \ninvestments will indirectly contribute to reduce adverse impacts of global warming to the poor. Also the private energy \nsavings and renewable energy investments will reduce pressure to the Government to finance such investment \nthrough public budget sources. End-use energy savings and efficiency improvements will provide financial and \neconomic benefits to consumers. Additional fiscal space may as a result be available for targeted poverty inventions.  \nB.     Targeting Classification \nGeneral Intervention  Individual or Household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.)   See A. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1. If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n    Not applicable \n2. What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? Not applicable \n3. If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)?   \nThe main focus of the investment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through new technology. The nature of \nthese investments do not provide opportunities for a pro-poor design since GHG emissions from the poor are limited \nmainly to the agriculture sector which is explicitly not supported by the Clean Technology Fund.  \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \n1. Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project?  \nThe overall goal of reducing GHG emissions will benefit the poor and socially excluded equally as all other people \nliving in Indonesia through reduction in air pollution and reduced health risk. Primary beneficiaries are industrial \nestates, agribusinesses using biomass power generation and owners and users of office and commercial buildings. \nBenefits will largely accrue to direct employees and users of the facilities which are unlikely to represent the poor. \nAlso the private investments will substitute public investments and generate energy savings that may provide \nadditional fiscal space for targeted poverty programs.   \n2. What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nThe investments are not known at this stage. However the GCPF has an established Social and Environmental \nManagement System to identify and address such constraints and potential adverse impacts. The private investors \nwill normally undertake marketing efforts to promote the understanding of the EE and RE investments for \nbeneficiaries \n3. What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? See 2 above \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.   \nAssociations of agribusiness producers, green building council, building owners, property management companies, \nheavy industries and banks   \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing The fund \nmanager will inform and consult in the course of its due diligence meetings with relevant above mentioned ", "Appendix 4 \nstakeholders. Some stakeholders such as the green building council may act as aggregators for investments. \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared during the project design for project implementation?    Yes          No     \nThe activity is part of the normal due diligence  process.  It will be reflected in the investment proposals submitted in \nthe investment plans. \nC.  Gender and Development       Proposed Gender Mainstreaming Category _No significant gender benefits \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? The \ninvestments are not known at this stage but adverse impact is unlikely. In any case GCPF\u2019s Social and Environmental \nManagement System to identify and address adverse impacts.  The private investors will normally promote the \nunderstanding of the EE and RE investments for beneficiaries including female users as appropriate. \n \n2. Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nby improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?   Yes         No    Please explain.  The focus of the program is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nthrough effective technologies. Households in residential buildings may benefit from  the EE measures irrespective of \ngender.  \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n       Yes          No    Please explain The investments are not known at this stage but adverse impact is unlikely. In \nany case GCPF\u2019s Social and Environmental Management System to identify and address adverse impacts.  \nIII.
