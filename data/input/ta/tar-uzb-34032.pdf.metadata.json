INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Uzbekistan requested the assistance of the ADB to rationalize and \nstrengthen the policy, legal and regulatory framework for the corporate sector and restructure \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) and enterprises with state ownership. A Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited  Tashkent  during  4- 12  November  2002  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, cost, financing, and implementation arrangements for the \ntechnical assistance (TA).1 The TA logical framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Macroeconomic Environment. Uzbekistan performed better economically than most \nformer Soviet Union republics in the mid-1990s due to favorable prices for its major export \ncommodities such as cotton and gold. However, slow progress in economic liberalization and \nvarious negative external shocks such as declining cotton and gold prices and the Russian \nfinancial crisis in 1998 have generated difficulties for the Uzbek economy. The Government \nagreed to undergo an  International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff-monitored program (SMP) in \nDecember 2001, which envisaged implementing some key economic reform policies, including \nreforming the agricultural sector, enhancing market competition, and narrowing the gap between \nthe  over-the-counter  (OTC)  exchange  rate  and  the  parallel  market  rate.  Progress  in \nimplementing the SMP has been mixed. While the gap between the exchange rates was \nbrought down from 110% at the beginning of 2002 to less than 30% in early November 2002, \nthrough ad hoc monetary interventions, the formal and informal controls on foreign exchange \naccess have prevented further closing the gap to 20%, a June 2002 target agreed upon by IMF \nand the Government.  \n \n3.  The fast depreciation of the exchange rate over the past year has had a significant \nimpact on consumer prices, the profitability and debt servicing of certain enterprises, and on the \nbanking system. The share of external debt to gross domestic product (GDP) rose to 41% at the \nofficial exchange rate in 2001. It is likely that the debt ratios will further rise sharply. The impact \non the budget is also serious as the debt service cost of Government borrowing will increase \nand Government guarantees issued for SOE borrowings will likely be called. IMF estimates the \nbudget deficit to increase from 2.5% of GDP in 2001 to about 3.5% in 2002 with the financing \ngap close to 0.5% of GDP, or about $70 million. \n \n4.  The  Enterprise  Sector.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  corporate  sector  which  comprises  110,000 \nregistered enterprises of various types and sizes is a major claimant of financial and human \nresources.  About  52,000  SOEs  have  gone  through  the  first  round  of  corporatization  and \nprivatization through the stock exchange, auctions or tenders. Most have been corporatized \neither as joint-stock companies (JSCs)2 or limited-liability companies. At present, the State holds \nshares in over 3,600 enterprises, including 168 strategic enterprises in which it holds more than \n25% of the shares. The industry sector value-added is relatively small at 14% of GDP by the \nend of 2001. There are 26 large production and trade associations (PTAs) that control 1,608 \nmember enterprises and  29 national holding companies (NHCs) that formed as JSCs. Five \nmajor strategic enterprises with state ownership are not formed as JSCs. In the year 2000, 43% \nof the unprofitable enterprises had state shareholdings and accounted for 86.3% of the total \nlosses of the enterprise sector. In 2001, the situation worsened when the same ratios climbed to \n71.4% and 94.7%, respectively. The labor productivity of private enterprises is about 2-3 times \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in October 2002. \n2  JSCs with more than 50 shareholders are classified as open JSCs and are required to be closely monitored for \nfinancial disclosure and transparency. Those with less than 50 shareholders are classified as closed JSCs. \n ", "2    \nhigher and incidence of insolvency lower than that in state-owned and partially state-owned \nenterprises.  \n \n5.  Bankruptcy and Enterprise Restructuring. Bankruptcies have risen in recent years \ndue to unfavorable economic conditions and the sharp depreciation of the official exchange \nrate.3 However, reorganization after bankruptcy has not always been successful in enhancing \nthe viability of the enterprise sector. Moreover, progress in restructuring has been slow because \nof several weaknesses in the legal and regulatory framework and concerns over the likely social \nimpact. The Government has adopted a program of modifying, restructuring, and liquidating of \nover 400 medium and large enterprises and established the State Committee for Economic \nInsolvency of Enterprises (CEIE) to provide leadership in policy and regulatory oversight. CEIE \nis currently analyzing enterprise data and preparing plans for restructuring of enterprises. It has \nsubmitted a draft bill amending the Bankruptcy Law. The Government is considering a proposal \nto  separate  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  from  commercial  banks  and  establish  an  asset-\nrestructuring agency to arrange for NPLs restructuring or liquidating. \n \n6.  Privatization.  The  State  Property  Committee  (GKI)  is  responsible  for  facilitating \nprivatization and managing the assets and shares of strategic and large SOEs and JSCs. GKI \nimplements a privatization program that the Parliament periodically reviews and approves. The \nprivatization program for 2003-2005 targets an additional 4,000 SOEs and JSCs. Special \nprograms  have  been  drawn  up  for  the  sale  of  telecommunications,  energy,  and  financial \nenterprises. Despite recent progress,4 privatization is still slow and incoherent because of (i) \ninvestors' concerns over current account convertibility, (ii) Government's unwillingness to cede \nmajority  ownership  to  foreign  investors,  (iii)  continued  State  interference  with  investment \ndecisions, (iv) insufficient capacity for evaluating and structuring privatization transactions, (v) \nweak capital markets, and (vi) legal and regulatory impediments to investments. As a result, \nstrategic investors, both domestic and foreign, are reluctant to commit to long-term equity \ninvestment in Uzbekistan. \n \n7.  Corporate Governance. In addition to adverse economic conditions, enterprises in \nUzbekistan suffer from poor corporate governance due to (i) \"upstream\" issues related to weak \nand sometimes adverse external policy and legal environment for corporate governance, (ii) \n\u201cdownstream\u201d issues related to inadequate corporate legal structure and enterprises\u2019 inability to \ncomply with legal norms, and (iii) underdeveloped supporting infrastructure such as financial \nmanagement system and capital markets for better corporate governance. \n \n8.  Currently, existing barriers to entry and exit of enterprises in key economic sectors are \nconsiderable  due  to  the  inadequate  legal  and  operational  framework  for  insolvency,  and \nrestrictions on market competition. While the Government has committed to IMF to reform the \nforeign exchange regime, it has not addressed the issue of SOE subsidies, which operate \nthrough dual exchange rates and credit guarantees. Despite attempts to streamline the tax \nsystem, the tax burden on enterprises is still high and the system of tax administration causes \nundue difficulties for enterprises. No credible, independent mechanism for third-party resolution \nof disputes between enterprises exists and the legal framework for pledges needs improvement. \nThe Central Bank of Uzbekistan expects that a decree on nonjudicial foreclosure of collateral \nwill be made effective once amendments to Civil Code are adopted.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Many enterprises obtained loans denominated in foreign currency with Government guarantees at the official \nexchange rate of SUM100-200/dollar a few years ago. The current official exchange rate is SUM800-900/dollar. \n4  Sale of 723 SOEs generated SUM23.2 billion in 2001 (about 0.5% of GDP), representing an increase of 60% over \nthe previous year. Over January-March 2002, sale proceeds amounted to SUM8.3 billion, up 50% year-on-year. ", "      3 \n9.  A critical downstream issue is the inadequacy of information and protection for minority \nshareholders.  For  instance,  the  Government  enjoys  disproportionate  rights  and  frequently \nissues new shares based on arbitrary revaluations. As a result the share capital of the minority \nshareholders is diluted. The supervisory councils in many JSCs lack independence and clearly \ndefined fiduciary roles. The state trustees and trustee managers enjoy undue and preferential \npowers. PTAs and NHCs de facto play the role of the line ministries and are involved in policy \nmaking and regulatory functions as well as operational oversight. The convoluted ownership \nand cross-shareholding structures among many JSCs and PTAs5 result in inefficiencies through \ncross-subsidization and financial leveraging.  \n \n10.  As  for  the  environment  for  corporate  governance,  the  Government's  prescribed \naccounting and auditing norms have yet to meet international standards. Currently, the capital \nmarkets  regulator  is  a  division  of  GKI  and  therefore  lacks  both  legal  and  functional \nindependence. The Securities Law is not well-integrated with other legislation on companies, \nand  the  institutional  capability  and  enforcement  authority  under  the  existing  regulatory \nframework are weak. The stock exchange does not have self-regulatory capability and capital \nmarkets  participants  such  as  securities  firms,  brokers,  and  institutional  investors  lack \ninstitutional  capacity.  Lastly,  there  are  no  significant  institutional  investors  on  the  capital \nmarkets. The privatization investment funds (PIFs) created in 1996 are widely perceived to be \nineffective and they own only about 0.15% of shares issued by JSCs. \n \n11.  Legal and Regulatory Framework. The legal and regulatory framework on enterprises \nincludes  laws  on  JSCs  and  shareholder  protection,  banks  and  banking activity, securities \nmarket and the stock exchange, competition and antimonopoly, and bankruptcy. These laws are \nimplemented under the main umbrella of the Civil Code. In addition, the Cabinet of Ministers \n(COM) and the President have issued a large  number of resolutions and decrees to give \nspecific  directives  or  additional  powers  not  granted  in  the  legislation.  Considerable \ninconsistencies  appear  within  and  across  laws,  resolutions,  and  decrees.  The  Supreme \nEconomic  Court  is  understaffed  and  lacks  adequate  institutional  capability  and  coherent \nprocedures to enforce economic laws. The capacity to enforce court decisions is inadequate. \n \n12.  Social Protection. Uzbekistan faces a serious challenge in providing social protection \nas part of the economic restructuring process. Although the registered unemployment rate is \nless than 1% in recent years, the actual, unregistered unemployment rate, or underemployment \nrate,  is  estimated  to  be  4-6%.  Restructuring  the  agriculture  enterprises  since  1998  has \nretrenched more than 400,000 farm employees in rural areas. The Ministry of Labor estimates \nthat every year, an additional 60,000 persons will lose their jobs due to bankruptcy and 55,000 \ndue to restructuring in urban areas in the coming years, and the number of people receiving \nunemployment assistance will double. The pension system is a pay-as-you-go scheme and \nthere is no plan yet to convert it into a funded scheme. The magnitude of outstanding social \nsecurity liabilities stemming from enterprise restructuring, which can pose significant risks to the \nGovernment\u2019s financial position is still not clear. \n \n13.  Operations and Strategy of the ADB and Other Sources. ADB has provided TA \nsupport to review the institutional and internal control structures within PTAs, and  enhance \nawareness of corporate governance.6 The TA has recommended that the Government gradually \ndismantle  the  PTA  structures.  The  Government  has  requested  further  ADB  assistance  to \nfacilitate initiatives for restructuring and liquidating the targeted enterprises that are operationally \n                                                 \n5  For example, Uzbekneftgas, the PTA controlling the petroleum and gas sector, has 8 directly held entities and 80 \nindirectly held entities. Some PTAs and NHCs have a network of as many as 150 large JSCs.  \n6  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Uzbekistan for Corporate Governance Reform Program. Manila. \n ", "4    \nor financially weak within the broader framework of a loan for corporate governance and \nenterprise restructuring program (CGERP), which will be developed in 2003. The World Bank, \nthrough its TA loan on enterprise institutional building, has established the Case-by-Case \nPrivatization Bureau for large SOEs and the Enterprise Institutional Building Bureau for small \nenterprises.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The TA will facilitate Uzbekistan\u2019s economic transition of the enterprise sector. The TA \nwill  (i)  support  the  formulation  of  a  strategy  for  corporate  governance  and  restructuring \nenterprises; (ii) launch restructuring initiatives in the state enterprise sector; (iii) rationalize and \nstrengthen the enabling policy, legal, and regulatory framework within which the corporate \nsector operates, and (iv) enhance the capacity for regulatory oversight of enterprises in a \nmarket-based environment. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA has two components. Component A for sector policy and enterprise restructuring \nwill cover three areas: \n \n(i)  Industrial policy and regulatory assessment. Evaluate fiscal vulnerability due \nto operational and financial weaknesses in enterprises; assess the adequacy of \nindustry  sector  policies;  evaluate  the  tax  regime;  assess  the  role  of  capital \nmarkets; recommend regulatory and institutional reforms; assist in developing \neffective mechanisms for involving commercial banks in financial restructuring of \nenterprises; and develop institutional mechanisms to enhance capacity in all \nthese areas.  \n \n(ii)  Enterprise  restructuring  and  development  of  a  social  safety  net \nmechanism. Select a sample of nonviable  enterprises with State shares and \nhelp  initiate  their  closure,  liquidation,  and  restructuring;  review and identify \nconstraints  on  debt  restructuring  and  transfer  of  ownership;  estimate  the \nrestructuring  costs;  evaluate  the  impact  of  enterprise  restructuring  on  the \nworkforce, develop detailed labor restructuring options, and design adjustment \nprograms to mitigate any adverse effects; and start formulating strategies leading \nfor establishing a multi-pillar pension system. \n \n(iii)  Legal  and  judicial  assessment  to  support  enterprise  restructuring  and \nprivate sector development. Strengthen the legal and judicial framework to \nsupport  enterprise  restructuring,  execution  of  pledges,  and  resolution  of \ncommercial disputes; simplify the legal and regulatory framework to facilitate \npostprivatization  and  private  sector  development;  identify  impediments  in \nenforcing commercial legislation and judicial decisions; and design mechanisms \nto strengthen the role of legal and judicial institutions in this regard. \n \n16.  Component B will evaluate the need for establishing an enterprise restructuring equity \nfund that could take up strategic long-term equity investments to effectively reduce Government \nownership and attract private investments. \n ", "      5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.45 million equivalent, including foreign \nexchange cost of $835,000 and local currency cost of $615,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the \nforeign exchange cost of $835,000 and the local currency cost of $165,000 equivalent on a \ngrant basis, from its TA funding program. The Government will contribute $450,000 in kind for \noffice space, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services. Appendix 2 presents detailed \ncost estimates. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  CEIE will be the Executing Agency (EA) for both components. An interagency working \ngroup will be established, under the leadership of the chairperson of CEIE, comprising members \nfrom GKI, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Justice, Center on Control and Coordination of the \nSecurities Market, Central Bank of Uzbekistan, and the Supreme Economic Court. The working \ngroup  will  coordinate  the  TA  and  give  effective  counterpart  support  for  the  respective \ncomponents.  CEIE  will  provide  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  transportation,  and  logistic \nsupport to the consultants.  \n \n19.  The TA will engage 10 international consultants for a total of 30 person-months. The \nconsultants (28 person-months) for Component A will be an  industry policy and regulatory \nspecialist (6) as the team leader, three enterprise restructuring and privatization specialists (4 \neach), a social safety net specialist (2), a taxation specialist (2), a capital markets specialist (2), \nand two  legal experts (2 each). Component B will engage a private equity investment fund \nspecialist (2). Ten domestic consultants will provide 30 person-months of inputs in the same \nareas. The terms of reference and reporting arrangements are in Appendix 3. Component A will \nbe tendered to an international firm based on a simplified technical proposal, using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method. Consultants for component B will be recruited individually. All \nthe consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. The TA will begin in February 2003 and will be completed in December 2003. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Uzbekistan for Enterprise Restructuring and Corporate Governance, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6   Appendix 1   \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nMonitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets \nMechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \nSupport the economic  Formulation of corporate governance  Progress reports by  Effective Government \ntransition from central  and enterprise restructuring strategy,  consultants and the  support for continued \nplanning to a market based  and   executing agencies  reform \none  (EAs) \nLaunching the restructuring of the state \nenterprise sector  Supervision by Asian \nDevelopment Bank \n(ADB) review missions \nPurpose       \nRationalize the policy  Industrial policy and macro and  Progress reports by  Close coordination \nframework  regulatory assessment  consultants and EA  between Committee \nfor Economic \nStrengthen the legal and  Development of social safety net  Supervision by ADB \nInsolvency of \nregulatory framework to  mechanism  review missions and \nEnterprises (CEIE) \nsupport postprivatization,  government \nLegal and judicial sector assessment  and other relevant \nenterprise restructuring, and  interagency committee \nprivate sector development  Establishing an enterprise restructuring  Government agencies  \nand private equity fund \nOrganize and conduct \nenterprise restructuring  Capacity building for efficient \nsupervision and regulation of \nenterprises \nOutputs       \nEvaluate fiscal vulnerability  Assessment of the commercial banks'  Progress reports by  High qualify \ndue to weak enterprise sector  exposure  consultants and EAs  preparatory work by \nthe EAs \nQuickly assess the industrial  Estimation of the outstanding arrears to  Supervision by ADB \nsector policies  national pension  review missions and  Quality of TA \ngovernment  implementation by the \nReview and evaluate the tax  Quantification of distortion brought by \ninteragency committee  EAs \nregime and the role of capital  foreign exchange controls;
