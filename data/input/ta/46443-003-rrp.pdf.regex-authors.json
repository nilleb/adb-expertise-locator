THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan funded by the Special Funds resources (the A-loan) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), and (ii) a proposed loan funded through the participation of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Infrastructure Fund (the B-loan), both to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR) for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns Development \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  support  the  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  in  enhancing  the \ncompetitiveness of two towns, Houayxay and Luang Namtha, which are located along the \nNorth\u2013South Economic Corridor (NSEC), one of the three main economic corridors in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS).2 The project will result in improved urban services in the two \ntowns through solid waste management improvement, urban roads and drainage upgrades, \nriverbank protection, river port upgrades, urban renewal, and urban recreation provision. The \nproject  will  enhance  climate  resilience  and  will  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  \u201c3Es\u201d  of  economy, \nenvironment, and equity, as outlined in its Urban Operational Plan.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The six GMS countries form a geographically contiguous region and an important cluster \nof economic activity.4 Despite wide divergence in their current level of economic development, \nthe GMS countries are following increasingly similar urban development trajectories. Key drivers \nof urban development and regional integration include the anticipation of the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity  by  December  2015,  increased  domestic  and  international  migration  within  the \nregion, the economic rise of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), significant improvements in \nroad networks and connectivity, increasingly ubiquitous and improving cell phone and internet \ncoverage, and a great potential and growing demand for tourism and related activities. The \nthree economic corridors defined under the GMS framework form a network of important routes \nthat connect some of the GMS' largest cities, including Bangkok, Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, \nKunming, Nanning, and Phnom Penh.5 \n \n4.  This  project  in  the  Lao  PDR,  together  with  projects  in  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam, \nrepresent the second phase of the GMS Corridor Towns Development Project in these countries, \nwhich supports urban development along the East\u2013West Economic Corridor and the Southern \nEconomic Corridor.6 The focus on developing towns along economic corridors aims to maximize \nthe benefits of increased trade and traffic flows to strengthen their competitiveness and catalyze \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \nDevelopment Project (TA 8425-REG).  \n3  ADB. 2012. Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20122020. Manila. \n4  The GMS countries are Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (PRC) (specifically Yunnan Province and \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region), the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n5  The three economic corridors are the NSEC, the East\u2013West Economic Corridor, and the Southern Economic \nCorridor.

The development of environmental infrastructure will \npromote green growth and climate resilience of these towns in the future. The project supports \nthe first four strategic thrusts of the GMS Strategic Framework 2012\u20122022: (i) strengthening \ninfrastructure links; (ii) facilitating cross-border trade, investment, and tourism; (iii) enhancing \nprivate sector participation and competitiveness; and (iv) developing human resources.7 \n \n5.  Towns along (i) the Southern Economic Corridor, which links Thailand to southern Viet \nNam through Cambodia; and (ii) the NSEC, with one branch that links the Lao PDR to the PRC, \nThailand, and Myanmar, and another branch that links Ha Noi to Kunming and Nanning in the \nPRC, are well positioned to serve as dynamic centers of investment and economic growth.8 The \nstrategic location of the corridor towns provides the stimulus for increased trade and investment. \nAccess to markets will provide many incentives for local economies in the hinterlands of the \ncorridor towns. Given these development opportunities, and with the rapid growth of the urban \npopulation and expansion of urban areas, several corridor towns are now facing demands for \nurban infrastructure and essential support services, including Houayxay and Luang Namtha in \nthe Lao PDR along the NSEC. \n \n6.  Houayxay is a medium-sized town and the administrative capital of Bokeo Province in \nthe northwestern part of the Lao PDR; it is close to the country\u2019s border with Myanmar and \nThailand. With a population of about 68,000 in 2013, the town has been growing steadily as a \ncenter for commercial activities in the province, with an expanding economy where growth is \nlinked to cross-border activities, tourism, logistics, and small-scale industries. The town serves \nas a river port and transfer point for tourists and goods traveling to the northern uplands of the \nLao PDR and to Thailand. \n \n7.  Luang Namtha town is the administrative capital of Luang Namtha Province in the \nnorthwestern part of the Lao PDR bordering the PRC and Myanmar. Luang Namtha town, with a \npopulation of about 55,000 in 2013, is strategically located near the border with the PRC. \nLocated in one of the poorest provinces in the Lao PDR, the local economy continues to rely \nlargely on the agriculture sector. The town continues to see growth in the tourism sector due to \nits proximity to the Nam Ha Biodiversity Conservation Area and the upgrading of its airport in \n2008. Continued growth is expected in ecotourism, small-scale industries, and agroprocessing. \n \n8.  Lessons learned. Among the key lessons learned from completed or ongoing ADB-\nfinanced projects in urban development, including the first phase of the GMS Corridor Towns \nDevelopment  Project  in  the  Lao  PDR,  are:  (i)  civic  participation  and  demand-driven \ndevelopment activities enhance the sense of local ownership; (ii) capacity building requires \nproper planning, adequate targeting, and up-front implementation; (iii) institutional and policy \nreform should be based on realistic assessments of timing, resource requirements, and political \nwill; (iv) financial cost recovery is critical to project sustainability; (v) streamlined approaches to \nprocurement and contract packaging secure effective project implementation; and (vi) strong \nexecuting agency leadership, adequate selection of project staff with clearly defined roles and \nresponsibilities, and capacity and training on ADB procedures and required submissions are \ncrucial for effective implementation. These lessons are closely aligned with the project, which \nhas a strong capacity development component, optimizes the value of community involvement, \nand adopts a business plan approach to revenue collection and operation and maintenance \n(O&M). Executing agencies will also receive start-up support on ADB procedures upon project \ncommencement. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2011.

Related policies and strategies. The project conforms with government policies and \nstrategies, including the Seventh Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan and \nother relevant national policies and strategies.9 In particular, the project is set within the context \nof a policy framework where the provincial and municipal authorities will incrementally assume \nthe main role for planning and implementation. \n \n10.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for the Lao \nPDR; ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, which encourages economic competiveness of cities, \ngreen development, and inclusive growth (footnote 3); the GrEEEn Cities Approach, which has \nbeen piloted in several cities in Indonesia, Malaysia,  Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam; ADB\u2019s \nWater Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020; the GMS Strategic Framework (footnote 7); the GMS \nUrban  Development  Strategic  Framework  2015\u20132022,  and  the  GMS  Regional  Investment \nFramework Implementation Plan, 2014\u20132018.10 The towns under this project were selected and \nprioritized under the GMS Regional Investment Framework as towns that (i) are localized within \nthe GMS economic corridors, and (ii) directly contribute to economic and urban development. \nAs part of project preparation, strategic local economic development plans (SLEDPs), which \npresent the medium-term strategy, planning, and investment plan for each town, have been \nprepared. The SLEDPs are based on assessments of potential investments in four dimensions \n(economic  development,  environment,  equity,  and  good  governance),  and  extensive \nconsultations and discussions. The SLEDPs, which enhance existing provincial master plans \nand anchor these to the regional context of the GMS, will be refined and endorsed as part of the \nproject. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n11.  The  impacts  will  be  aligned  with  the  Seventh  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132015  targets  of  maintaining  economic  growth,  achieving  poverty \nreduction  targets,  ensuring  sustainable  development,  and  supporting  regional  integration \n(footnote 9). The outcome will be improved urban services in Houayxay and Luang Namtha. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The outputs of the project are (i) SLEDPs developed, (ii) priority urban infrastructure \ninvestments  implemented,  (iii)  institutional  capacities  for  managing  public  investments \nstrengthened,  and  (iv)  community  awareness  on  project  activities  and  environmental \nsustainability improved. The infrastructure investments in each town are based on local demand \nand match the priorities selected by the government.  \n \n13.  In  Houayxay,  the  project  will  finance  solid  waste  management,  urban  roads  and \ndrainage, riverbank protection, a riverside road and walkway, river port rehabilitation, and an \necological park and recreation area. This will include (i) construction of a 2-kilometer (km) \nriverside walkway to provide enhanced access from the main urban area to the south of the \ntown; (ii) construction of a 1-km riverside embankment for enhanced protection of the town \n                                                \n9  Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2010.

Incremental \nadministration costs for project administration, including annual audits, will also be financed. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $52 million (Table 1). \n \n17.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR26,382,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (A-loan)  and  a  loan  of  $10,000,000 \nthrough the participation of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (B-loan) to help finance the project. \nThe A-loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter (the interest and other \ncharges  during  construction  to  be  capitalized  in  the  A-loan),  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The B-loan will have a 20-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility11 and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan agreement. Financing from both loans will be provided on a pro rata basis. \n \n   \n                                                \n11 The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The subprojects were selected for the provision of basic environmental services. This \nwill  be  achieved  through  improved  solid  waste  management,  urban  roads  and  drainage \nupgrades,  and  urban  recreation  opportunities  (Houayxay  and  Luang  Namtha);  riverbank \nprotection, a riverside road and walkway and river port rehabilitation (Houayxay); urban village \nupgrade, and construction of a bridge (Luang Namtha). The subprojects are technically feasible \nand use optimum design solutions and standards, where the technology for undertaking the civil \nworks and O&M can be managed by the provincial and municipal authorities. Climate resilient \ndesign has been ensured including, for example, through designing the Houayxay riverbank \nprotection upgrade, and riverside road and walkway, with an extra height; and by designing \ndrainage in both Houayxay and Luang Namtha to account for future rainfall increases due to \nclimate change. Appropriate levels of capacity building and training are assured in the project \nloan.  \n \n21.  The project recognizes the weak institutional capacity of the provincial and municipal \nauthorities  to  plan  and  manage  urban  sector  development,  implement  and  operate  urban \ninfrastructure, and deliver essential urban services. This will be addressed through targeted \ntraining and institutional capacity building. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  An economic analysis was undertaken for all subprojects to determine their viability, \nusing the computation of economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as the indicator. The base case \nresults indicate all components are economically viable with an estimated EIRR exceeding the \nassumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The EIRR results range from 16% to \n33% for Houayxay and 14% to 19% for Luang Namtha. All subprojects were generally also \nviable under adverse scenarios in which costs were higher or benefits lower by 10% compared \nto the base case.13 These scenarios included a 10% increase in capital cost, 10% increase in \nO&M cost, 10% reduction in benefits, and a 1-year delay in the realization of benefits. \n \n23.  A financial analysis was conducted for both the revenue- and the nonrevenue-generating \nsubprojects  of  each  town  to  confirm  the  sustainability  of  the  investment.  The  analysis \nestablished that, for both towns, sufficient counterpart funds for their investment components \nwill be available. None of the public entities involved in the operation of the respective project \ncomponents is corporatized. They are all general government sector units, and their accounts \nare not ring-fenced. Therefore, a financial internal rate of return has not been calculated. The \ntariffs  collected  for  the  revenue-generating  components  (e.g.,  solid  waste  management) \ncurrently do not fully cover the cost for O&M, but will be adjusted over time to meet these \nrequirements. Any funding gap for meeting the full O&M cost will be covered by the provincial \ngovernments, a commitment that has been covenanted in the loan agreement. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Assessment  shows  that  the  executing  agency  has  experience  with  the  financial \nmanagement and fund disbursement systems applicable to ADB projects. It has developed the \ninstitutional capacity to undertake international and national competitive bidding for civil works \nand goods. The project financial management risk is considered high, primarily in the provinces \nand municipalities. Capacity development and training assistance will be provided to the PCU \nand PIUs on financial and procurement management and fund disbursement. \n                                                \n13 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MPWT.14 The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  From the poverty and social analysis conducted, the project is classified as general \nintervention.15 The overall project social impacts are expected to be positive, with expected \nimprovements to the quality of life for people in both towns. The project will result in improved \nclimate-resilient infrastructure for the participating towns, benefiting all social strata, including \nthe urban poor and other vulnerable groups in each town. Proposed tariffs for solid waste \nmanagement  have  been  assessed  as  affordable  for  low-income  groups.  Specifically,  the \nsubproject component proposals for improving urban drainage will improve flood protection for \nthe project-affected people, their homes, and their property. Poor and vulnerable households \nlocated  in  low-lying  flood-prone  areas  and  who  experience  insufficient  and/or  lack  basic \nenvironmental sanitation services stand to benefit the most. \n \n27.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. The gender  analysis \nconcluded that women in the subproject areas  might not fully realize project benefits and \nopportunities  if  gender  issues  concerning  women\u2019s  employment  opportunities  and  sector \nrepresentation in decision making are not mainstreamed in project activities. Accordingly, a \ngender action plan has been prepared with the aim of (i) promoting the mainstreaming of gender \nissues in project planning and implementation, (ii) addressing specific impacts and risks that \nmay affect women differently or disproportionately compared with men, and (iii) enhancing \nparticipation of women in project benefits. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  Social  safeguards.  The  safeguard  category  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  B.  Two \nresettlement  plans,  one  per  town,  will  be  prepared  for  components  that  will  trigger  land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts. For both the subprojects, a total area of 29.11 \nhectares of land will be acquired, affecting 55 affected households (351 affected persons), \nincluding 32 severely affected households (177 affected persons). In addition to partial loss of \nland, other impacts include loss of crops, trees, and aquaculture. The total LAR cost, estimated \nat $440,000 (including contingencies), will be provided through counterpart financing.16 \n \n29.  All  affected  households  are  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation  assistance. \nSeverely affected and vulnerable households will be provided income restoration through cash \nassistance and skills training, and receive priority for employment in project-related construction \nworks.  A  cutoff  date  will  be  established  following  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  and \nparticipation. Project information has been disclosed to affected persons throughout project \npreparation, and a project information booklet will be updated and distributed during a detailed \nmeasurement survey during project implementation. There will be effective internal monitoring \nduring all stages of the subprojects\u2019 implementation. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information \ndisclosure and consultation requirements, the safeguard documents will be posted on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2010.

Indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples safeguards are not triggered by any project \ncomponent in Houayxay or Luang Namtha, and the safeguard category for indigenous peoples \nis C in accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n31.  Environment safeguards. The project is classified as category B for environment in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. One initial environmental examination \n(IEE) report and two environmental management plans (EMPs) (one per town) have been \nprepared. 17  The  proposed  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  cause  irreversible  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Mitigation measures for identified impacts have been incorporated in the \nEMPs. In addition, potential impacts of climate change and natural hazards (e.g., flooding and \nearthquake) on the project have been recommended for integration into the detailed design stage \nas part of the IEE assessment whenever appropriate.  \n \n32.  The  final  EMPs  will  form  part  of  the  contract  bidding  documents.  Environmental \nconsiderations  during  design,  and  allocation  of  sufficient  budget for O&M,  will  help  mitigate \npotential adverse impacts during operation. Effective environmental monitoring at all stages of \nsubproject implementation will be supported by including budget and institutional arrangements \nfor EMP implementation and monitoring. Specifically, EMP implementation will be supported by a \ndesignated environment officer in the respective PIUs of the executing agency (footnote 17). \n \n33.  Climate change projections and climate change impacts on the project are discussed in \nthe climate vulnerability and risk assessment section of the IEE. Costs that may be attributed to \nclimate change adaptation are estimated at $1 million, representing about 2% of the total loan \namount.  \n \n34.  Resettlement and environment documents have been prepared in consultation with local \ncommunities and are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the laws and \nregulations of the Lao PDR. The documents have been endorsed, approved, and posted on the \nADB  website. The  project towns  have  demonstrated  a  high  level  of commitment to  social \n \nsafeguards, and have allocated their own resources for LAR. Implementation arrangements \ninclude designated responsibilities for safeguards monitoring. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  The integrated benefits and impacts from the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \nThe overall risk is assessed as medium. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of capacity for project  Support and training provided by project implementation and capacity \nimplementation and management  development consultants. \nIrregularities in procurement and  Provisions included in loan agreement and bidding documents.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n36.  The government and the MPWT have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and MPWT have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants  and  disbursement  conditions  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreements (A-loan agreement and B-loan agreement). \n \n37.
