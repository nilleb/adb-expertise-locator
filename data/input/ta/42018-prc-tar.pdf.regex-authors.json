INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the Country Programming Midterm Review Mission of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 2007, the Government confirmed its \nrequest  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  preparation  of  the  Anhui  Road  Network \nDevelopment Project.1 A fact-finding mission visited the project area in June 2008. This report is \nbased on the understanding reached with the Government regarding the impact and outcome, \nmethodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA, as well as the mission\u2019s observations. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Anhui is a landlocked province in central PRC with a land area of 139,400 square \nkilometers (km2). The province has a population of 66 million, 63% of which is rural\u2014higher than \nthe national average of 56%. The population density, at 470 persons per km2, is significantly \nhigher than the national average of 138 and the central region\u2019s 355. Anhui is one of the \nleast-developed provinces, with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranked 28th among \nall the provinces, ahead of only Guizhou, Gansu, and Yunnan. GDP per capita in 2006 was \nabout 63% of the national average. Poverty and urban-rural disparity are the two major issues. \nOf  the  province\u2019s  61  counties,  26  are  officially  designated  poverty  counties.  In  2006,  the \naverage  annual  per  capita  disposable  income  in  the  province  was  CNY9,771  for  urban \nhouseholds, while the average annual per capita net income was only CNY2,969 for rural \nhouseholds. Of the 61 counties, 51 had a GDP per capita lower than the provincial average, and \nonly 1 county reached the national average. The Government launched the New Countryside \nInitiative in 2005 in a bid to promote the development of its vast rural areas, where most of the \npoor  live.  The  accessibility  and  mobility  of  the  population  is  an  important  aspect  of  the \nsocioeconomic development of the rural regions in the project area, and it must be tackled \nunder the proposed project to ensure sustainable rural development. \n \n3.  Inadequate road infrastructure has been a major obstacle to economic development and \npoverty reduction in Anhui. The province had 148,320 kilometers (km) of roads at the end of \n2007. Expressways and high-standard highways (class I and class II) amounted to 2,568 km, or \n8.4%  of  the  provincial  total\u2014lower  than  the  national  average  of  10.6%\u2014and  class  IV  or \nunclassified roads made up more than 82%. Compared with the six surrounding provinces (see \nmap), Anhui has an above-average network density (km per 100 km2), but a lower percentage \nof paved roads (as a proxy for the quality of the infrastructure). The major issues regarding the \ncurrent  road  network are:  (i)  lower-class  road  connections  on  the eastward  corridors;  and \n(ii) poor quality of pavement, low accessibility in the south mountainous region, and weak \nresistance against disasters. \n \n4.  Developing a comprehensive transportation system under the Rising Central Region \nStrategy is a key theme of the 11th Five-Year Plan of the central Government. The strategy \nproposes to transform the six provinces in the central region\u2014Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, \nJiangxi, and Shanxi\u2014into a key transport hub linking east and west, and north and south. Road \nsector development, as a way to promote economic growth and poverty reduction in the region, \nis  a  high  priority.  Anhui  Province  is  particularly  well  positioned  to  benefit  from  the  growth \n\u201cspillover\u201d  effects  from  neighboring  Jiangsu  Province  through  the  development  of  transport \ncorridors linking the coastal growth zone with central and western PRC. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 June 2008. The ensuring \ninvestment project is estimated to be $200 million. \n ", "2   \n5.  The proposed project will support the strategy by building a 134 km expressway from \nMingguang in the north to the Jiangsu border (toward Xuzhou). This proposed expressway will \nbe part of the Xuzhou\u2013Nanjing corridor, a high-priority corridor in the Rising Central Region \nTransport Plan (2005\u20132015), and a vital link in routes from the coastal area via Nanjing\u2013Xuzhou \nand onward to Jinan (Shandong Province), Hebei, Shanxi, and the west. Traffic growth in the \ncorridor is expected to be robust, with substantial proportions of heavy commercial freight vehicles \nand long-distance bus services. The project expressway, 40 km shorter than the present route \nfrom the Jiangsu border to Mingguang on National Highway 104, will cut the travel time by car \nfrom 3 hours to 2. It will benefit 2.8 million people in three counties (Linbi, Sixian, and Wuhe), \ntwo  of  which  (Linbi  and  Sixian)  are  officially  designated  poverty  counties,  and  one  city \n(Mingguang). \n \n6.  The Anhui Provincial Communications Investment Group Company (ACIG) was set up \nby the government in May 2001 to develop and operate higways in Anhui. It will build and \noperate the proposed expressway, and is actively seeking private sector participation. Although \nthe proposed expressway is being planned in the public sector, various options for involving the \nprivate  sector  in  its  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  (through  non-sovereign  loan \nfinancing, outsourcing, or the sale of operating rights, among others) will be explored under the \nTA, with the aim of evaluating and setting new standards for corporate governance. \n \n7.  To improve services and connections on the overall road network, the Anhui Provincial \nCommunications Department (APCD) plans to improve about 5,700 km of national and provincial \nroads. Part of the proposed project will be the rehabilitation and upgrading of 10 sections of the \nlocal road network totaling 552 km (see map). These comprise three sections in northeastern \nAnhui that are directly related to the proposed expressway; three in the poor and mountainous \nsouthwestern  quadrant  of  the  province;  two  sections  of  key  roads  leading  south  to  Jiangxi \nProvince; a key connector east to Yangzhou City in Jiangsu Province; and a strategic local link \nbetween Hefei and the neighboring city of Chaohu. The road upgrading will improve (i) the sharing \nof benefits from the expressway and nonfarm development potential in the northeast of the \nprovince,  (ii) road  safety  and  environment  in  the  mountainous  region,  (iii) integration  with \nneighboring provinces, and (iv) the rural population\u2019s access to outside markets. \n \n8.  Road  safety  standards  throughout  the  PRC  are  recognized  to  be  poor,  with \nunacceptably high accident and fatality rates. In 2007, there were 9,240 road accidents in Anhui, \nresulting in almost 3,000 deaths and more than 12,000 injuries. The poor road conditions increase \nthe risk and severity of accidents. During the TA Fact-Finding Mission, ADB and APCD agreed to \ndevelop and implement a focused program of accident countermeasures, initially on the project \nroads but later throughout the province. Specific attention will be paid to urban sections, where \nthrough  traffic  and  local  needs  vie  for  access,  and  to  mountain  sections  with  substandard \nalignments. These measures will be accompanied by a targeted program of enforcement and \npublicity. A study under the TA will assist in identifying and evaluating the requirements of the \nproposed road safety enhancement program to be financed under the ensuing ADB loan. \n \n9.  Despite good progress in providing rural transport services connecting townships with \ncounties,  some  3,800  administrative  villages  still  have  no  formal  bus  services.  Transport \ndemand  is  usually  met  by  various  informal  transport  services.  Under  the  Promote  Rural \nTransport Service Plan of APCD for organized bus services to rural areas, 1,100 township bus \nstations will be built in the province. The proposed project will support the construction of \n50 class V  or class VI  township  bus  stations,  mostly  by  improving  the  existing  township \ntransport management stations. The upgraded bus stations will (i) conform to the APCD plan, \n(ii) contribute to an integrated solution to the need for accessibility, (iii) help improve access to \n ", "    3 \npoorer villages and townships in the province, and (iv) serve as a focus for bus services \nbetween  townships  and  surrounding  villages.  Combining  the  bus  and  township  transport \nmanagement  stations  will  afford  greater  convenience  for  passengers  and  minimize  land \nacquisition. \n \n10.  APCD will implement a system of regional route licensing to give bus operators more \nflexibility in customizing bus routes, schedules, and services to suit passenger needs, and allow \nthem to use their vehicles and drivers more efficiently. The licensing system, to be implemented \nbetween townships and nearby villages in three pilot counties, to start with, is expected to \nincrease productivity and lower unit costs. Ultimately, the lower costs should lead to lower fares \nand better service. A study under the TA will assist with the implementation of the proposed rural \ntransport reform demonstration project. Experience from the demonstration project will be used in \nreplicating the reform in other areas of the province. \n \n11.  The proposed project is consistent with the 11th Five-Year Plan and ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  which  is  concerned  with  managing  the  environment, \ncatalyzing investment, and improving knowledge products, among others.2 It conforms to ADB\u2019s \nroad sector assistance strategy in PRC. The strategy aims to provide financing and policy \nadvice in the PRC to (i) support the construction of roads that connect major growth centers, \ntogether with the subsidiary local roads; (ii) develop and improve urban transport and rural \nroads; (iii) promote road safety, cut vehicle emissions, and raise energy efficiency; (iv) improve \nthe commercial orientation and efficiency of expressway organizations; (v) strengthen regional \ncooperation in transport; (vi) promote public\u2013private partnership; and (vii) establish resource \nefficient transport. ADB road sector assistance targets the less-developed central and western \nprovinces, where most of the poor live. Recent reviews of the transport sector assistance \nprogram3 concluded that ADB\u2019s support for the PRC road sector in 1997\u20132005 was a success, \nbut suggested giving more attention to value addition in ADB-financed road projects. That \nrecommendation will be taken into account in the preparation of the proposed project. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The proposed project will improve the road transport network in Anhui Province and \nmake it more efficient, safe, and environment-friendly. The outcome of the TA will be an agreed \nproject design and implementation arrangements suitable for ADB financing. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Three subprojects namely (i) the expressway construction, (ii) local road rehabilitation \nincluding  traffic  safety  improvement,  and  (iii)  the  rural  transport  services  improvement \ndemonstration will be prepared under the TA. The consultants will (i) review the economic and \nenvironmental development strategies, priorities, and investment plan; (ii) identify the problems \nrelating to road infrastructure; services, environment, and safety issues and the urgency of \nmitigating the identified needs; (iii) assess the potential impact of the subprojects on the basis of \ntechnical, institutional, environmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant factors; \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "4   \n(iv) formulate balanced road network development and management strategies with measures \nto strengthen local road safety and promote environmental protection while improving rural \ntransport  services;  (v)  review  and  update  the relevant  studies,  analyses,  and  data  on  the \nfeasibility of the three subprojects; (vi) assist the APCD in preparing and strengthening the \nenvironmental impact assessments, resettlement plans, and social development action plan \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines,  and  in  conducting  public  consultations  and \ndisclosing relevant information; (vii) develop a project design and monitoring framework and \nrefine  it  through  a  stakeholder  workshop;  and  (viii) prepare  a  project  loan  proposal  for \nconsideration  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n14.  The consultants will prepare short best-practices or policy notes linked to the following \nareas, where high-level policy dialogue with key decision makers is envisaged: (i) local road \ndevelopment strategy, (ii) local road maintenance financing and prioritization, (iii) local road \nsafety, (iv) rural transport services, (v) axle load enforcement, (vi) vehicle emission reduction, \n(vii) private sector financing, (viii) institutional development road map and action plans for ACIG, \nand (ix) capacity-building program for APCD. \n \n15.  Major risks to the successful implementation of the TA are: (i) inadequate counterpart \nsupport and performance, (ii) inadequate or unavailable data, (iii) delayed submission of the \nrequired studies, (iv) delayed recruitment and mobilization of consultants and design institutes, \nand (v) inadequate performance of the consultants and design institutes. To mitigate these risks, \nthe recruitment and performance of the consultants and design institutes will be monitored \nclosely. The Government has also agreed to provide adequate counterpart support and all the \nnecessary data according to an agreed timetable. Close coordination among the consultants, \nthe executing and implementing agencies, and ADB will further reduce the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000. At the request of the Government, \nADB will finance $600,000 of that amount with a grant from its TA funding program. The \nGovernment will finance the rest of the local currency cost, equivalent to $150,000, by providing \ncounterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  other  support  services.  The  Government  has  been \ninformed that the approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The \n \ndetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  APCD will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The implementing agencies (IAs) will be \nACIG for the expressway construction, the Anhui Highway Administration Bureau for the local \nroad  rehabilitation  and  traffic  safety  improvement  on  local  road  network,  and  the  Anhui \nTransport  Administration  Bureau  (ATAB)  for  the  rural  transport  services  improvement \ndemonstration. APCD has set up a project management office (PMO) to give overall guidance \nand support to the proposed project.4 The PMO will ensure the study team has access to \nrelevant information and data, coordinate with ADB and related departments and bureaus in \nAPCD in TA implementation, and facilitate the required socioeconomic, poverty, and other \nsurveys. The PMO is led by a director and has at least three experienced professional staff, \nincluding a translator, who will work full-time with the consultants. \n \n                                                 \n4  The PMO was established in APCD in 1997 to implement World Bank\u2013financed projects. \n ", "    5 \n18.  The TA will have three parts, to be implemented over 10 months, from December 2008 \nto September 2009. Part A will involve the overall project preparation and best-practices or \npolicy  notes  preparation  (see  para.  2  of  appendix  4).  It  will  require  21  person-months  of \nconsulting services (8 international and 13 national). The international consultants will provide \nexpertise  in  (i) highway  engineering  and  road  safety,  (ii) transport  economics,  (iii)  financial \nanalysis and private sector development, and (iv) transport services. The national consultants \nwill  have  expertise  in  (i)  highway  engineering,  (ii) economic  and  financial  analysis, \n(iii) environmental impact assessment, (iv) resettlement planning, and (v) social (poverty and \ngender) impact analysis. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  A consulting firm will be hired for part A according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB will select and hire the consultants \nthrough simplified technical proposal procedures according to the quality of their technical \nproposal (90%) and the cost (10%) of the services to be provided (quality- and cost-based \nselection). The 90:10 weighting is considered appropriate because the proposed project is a \ncomplex, multidisciplinary assignment that requires innovation and creativity, and the quality of \nthe consulting services will have a high impact on the ensuing loan. The consultants will prepare \nall their reports in English and Chinese, and will maintain close working relations and discuss \nprogress and findings with ADB, the PMO, and the three IAs. Tripartite meetings among ADB \nstaff, the consultants, the PMO, and the three IAs will be held in Hefei, to guide the consultants \nand to review their reports. \n \n20.  Part B will be concerned with local road rehabilitation and traffic safety improvement on \nlocal road network, and part C with the preparation of a rural transport services improvement \ndemonstration project in Anhui as recommended by the Sustainable Rural Transport Services \nTA.5 Parts B and C will each require 12 person-months of consulting services to be undertaken \nby national consulting firms. Given the very small value of the contracts and the intensive \nrelevant experience of the two national firms6 recommended by APCD for the studies, ADB will \nhire  the  firms  through  single-source  selection  according  to  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. The two teams will work closely with the study team for part A. The terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n21.  APCD will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access; \ncity transport for the consultants; materials, maps, data, and documents required for the TA; and \nthe cost of utilities for the use of the consultants, counterpart professional staff, and support staff. \nThe  TA  equipment  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and transferred to APCD after the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Anhui Road Network \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy \nof the partner country. \n  A key part of the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) is the Rising Central Region Strategy, whose aim \nis to develop the six poor provinces in the central region of the PRC (Anhui, Henan, Hubei, and Hunan, Jiangxi, and \nShanxi). Of the six, Anhui is the least developed. However, it has locational advantages, in particular, its proximity to \nthe dynamic development pole around the Yangtze River Delta. Underdeveloped roads and the associated high \ntransportation costs are major barriers to the reduction of poverty in Anhui. Better roads would contribute directly to \npoverty reduction by improving access to markets, employment opportunities, and social services, and indirectly by \nstimulating economic development. \n  The proposed expressway is in northeastern Anhui, where the major agricultural products are wheat, corn, animal \nhusbandry  products,  peanut,  soybean,  and  vegetables.  National  Highway  104  (classes II\u2013III)  provides  good \ntransport access to the region, but its capacity is limited. Further, the local road network is poorly developed because \nof slow economic development. The proposed project will comprise the construction of an expressway and the \nimprovement of local roads and transport services, to promote and facilitate the social and economic development of \nthe region. \n \nB.   Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs \n  (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \nExplain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe proposed project will contribute indirectly to poverty reduction in the project area by generating economic and \nemployment opportunities through improved access to the Yangtze River Delta, the most vibrant development area in the \nPRC. It will substantially improve transport infrastructure and services and will facilitate economic development, thus \nproviding more employment and income opportunities for local people. The proposed project will also improve access to \nsocial services in the county centers and towns. \n \nAnhui is the fourth-poorest province in the country, in terms of GDP per capita (63% of the national average in 2006). Of \nthe 61 counties in the province, 18 were officially designated national poor counties in 2006, and 8, provincial poor \ncounties. In 2006, the average annual disposable income was CNY9,771 for urban residents, but only CNY2,969 for rural \nresidents. The proposed main road (expressway) will affect the four counties of Anhui\u2014Mingguang City in Chuzhou, \nWuhe County in Bengbu, and Lingbi and Sixian counties in Suzhou. These four counties are less developed than the \nprovincial average. In 2006, GDP per capita in these counties was CNY4,652 in Lingbi, CNY 5,640 in Sixian, CNY7,335 \nin Wuhe, and CNY6,277 in Mingguang. Lingbi and Sixian Counties are provincially designated poor counties. In 2006, the \nrural net income per capita was CNY2,367 in Lingbi and CNY2,520 in Sixian County, compared with the provincial \naverage of CNY2,969. The incidence of rural poor (net income below the average level) was 55.2% in Minguang, 41.7% \nin Wuhe, 74.0% in Lingbi, and 52.6% in Sixian County.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.   If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe proposed project could contribute directly to poverty reduction in the project area by generating construction \nemployment opportunities in the short term and improving access to markets for specialty cash crops, such as animal \nhusbandry products and vegetables. It will include the improvement of 552 km of local roads and 50 rural bus stations, in \naddition to the main road. It will also promote rural transport services and enhance local road traffic safety. \n \nA detailed poverty analysis will be carried out to assess poverty incidence in the project area and demonstrate how the \nproposed project will help reduce poverty through specific measures included in its scope. The analysis will be  based  on \nADB\u2019s Poverty Handbook (2006), Handbook on Social Analysis (November 2007), and Handbook for Integrating Poverty \nImpact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects (2001). \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \n  Based on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project? \n \nThe primary beneficiaries of the proposed project will be the people and businesses in cities, towns, and villages along \nthe project roads. With more convenient transport, agricultural products can reach market at lower cost, high-value cash \ncrops will replace common agricultural products, investments from the Yangtze River Delta will come into the project \narea, and employment opportunities will increase greatly.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nPeople in the project area now suffer from poor transport, which makes it difficult for them to benefit from the economic \ndevelopments  on  the  east  coast.  They  look  forward  to  the  improved  market  and  employment  opportunities  in \nnonagricultural occupations that the proposed project will bring about. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nThe main potential constraint is the poor condition of local roads. Hence, the improvement of the local road network will \nbe given great importance in the proposed project. During the TA, the possibility of providing a drying yard for peasants \nwhile local roads are being rebuilt and upgraded will also be studied. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders:  \n \nStakeholder analysis: Major stakeholders are APCD, ACIG, local governments, transport companies, local businesses, \nand local residents.  \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nConsultations began during the preparation of the preliminary feasibility study, which looked into three major alternatives \nfor the main road routing. The ADB TA fact-finding mission conducted an initial stakeholder consultation in the affected \ncounties. Further consultations will be carried out for the EIA, resettlement planning, and poverty and social analyses \nduring the TA. Stakeholder workshops will be conducted at the inception, midterm, and final tripartite meetings. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nLocal people (i) will be consulted during the feasibility study, TA implementation, and preliminary design to fix the main \nroad alignment; (ii) will participate in the preparation and implementation of village rehabilitation plans; and (iii) will be \nhired for the construction of the project roads. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or \nprogram? \nThe proposed project will improve access to markets and employment opportunities for the local community including \nwomen. The TA will investigate opportunities to enhance the benefits to women (e.g., better access to education, health \ncare, and markets through improvements in public transport service and local roads). The RP will also include special \nmeasures to mitigate the adverse impact and improve the conditions for women, including training and project-related \nemployment. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nby improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \nDuring the TA, all potential measures will be identified through consultation and participation, and a social development \naction plan (SDAP) with special measures to improve the conditions for women will be prepared. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \n3.   Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n       Yes          No    Please explain \nThe proposed project will have adverse impact from land acquisition and resettlement (to be addressed in the RP) and \nfrom increased risk of communicable diseases (to be addressed in the SDAP). Livelihood opportunities and training \nrequirements will be included in the RP. \nIII.
