THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Wuhan Urban Environmental Improvement \nProject.  \n \n2.  Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, ranks fifth among PRC cities for its size and its \neconomic production. In 2008, the municipality had a population of about 8.7 million. Some \n3.5 million people reside in its dense inner urban core. Wuhan\u2019s urban area is divided into three \nparts (Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang areas) by the Yangtze and Han rivers. The proposed \nproject is a key urban environmental initiative of Wuhan municipal government (WMG) with \nnationwide demonstration potential. The project will help WMG to (i) design and implement \nsustainable  solutions  for  the  management  of  wastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP)  sludge, \nincluding its energy recovery and reuse of biosolids; (ii) improve water quality in urban lakes and \nwater channels; (iii) reestablish water circulation and improve resilience to floods; (iv) improve \nthe  environment,  living  conditions,  and  public  health  standards;  and  (v)  enhance  public \nawareness of urban environmental and related public health issues. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  project  has  a  strong  rationale  both  in  terms  of  urban  development  and \nenvironmental improvement. It follows and complements two previous Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  loans,1 which  have  the  objective  of  building  the  necessary  wastewater  treatment \ninfrastructure in Wuhan. The project supports the PRC\u2019s country partnership strategy (2008\u2013\n2010):2 promoting efficient infrastructure, strengthening environmental management, supporting \ninclusive  growth,  and  balanced  development.  The  project  is  part  of  Wuhan\u2019s  master  plan \npriorities on sanitation, environment improvements, and urban development and will contribute \nto establishing Wuhan City as a model for sustainable development in the PRC. \n \n4.  The current sludge treatment and disposal arrangements are not sustainable in the \nPRC. The Government of the PRC is actively looking for potential solutions for the country\u2019s \nrapidly increasing volume of sewage sludge. By the end of 2008, 80% of Wuhan Municipality\u2019s \nwastewater was being treated. The initial success of the wastewater treatment investment, \nsupported by two prior ADB loans, has created an associated environmental challenge of \neffectively  managing  657  tons  of sewage  sludge  generated  daily  by  the  existing  WWTPs, \ncreating a serious environmental threat. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive solution \nfor sludge treatment and utilization; and to release the pressure on landfills, which are currently \nthe primary means of disposal. \n \n5.  The  project  is  the  first  ADB-assisted  project  to  pursue  comprehensive  sludge \nmanagement while fully attending to environmental concerns such as circular economy and \nclimate change mitigation. The policy discussion between the executing agency and the project \nteam introduced a decentralized and integrated approach for the sludge facilities\u2014based on \nsludge digestion and drying for beneficial reuse through land application\u2014fully complying with \nADB policies and recognized by the PRC as the best practice to support the 3Rs policy of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Manila (Loan 1996-PRC); and ADB. \n2006.

By doing so, the project has also guided and reoriented the long-\nterm  original  sludge  master  plan  of  the  city  based  on  centralized  treatment  and  solo \nincineration,3 which is controversial in terms of compliance with ADB\u2019s climate change agenda.  \n \n6.  The project will provide facilities to treat sludge from five of Wuhan\u2019s WWTPs and handle \nabout half (or 350 tons/day [t/d]) of Wuhan\u2019s total sludge production. Three of these WWTPs \nwere built under the earlier ADB-funded loans (footnote 1). Each of the three proposed sludge \ntreatment plants will be built on site and will take advantage of the urban master plan advocating \nfor an integrated, practical, and sustainable concept of urban environmental development. The \nproject promotes environmentally friendly sludge digestion by (i) capturing and using clean \nbiogas of an existing sludge facility financed by ADB, and (ii) using the steam of an existing \nthermal power plant to dry sludge at the sludge treatment plant. Both approaches reduce \nreliance on external energy sources required for the drying process. Subject to proper analysis \nmonitoring and environmental safeguards, treated sludge will be used as soil conditioner, as \nconstruction material, and for rehabilitating damaged urban land.4 \n \n7.  While comprehensive sludge solutions have not been fully recognized and benchmarked \nby the PRC authorities, the project has a potential of setting national policy decision making on \nsludge management. The beneficiary use of sludge promoted by the project will provide a model \nof  managing  WWTP  sludge,  extend  the  operational  life  of  landfills,  reduce  the  sludge \ntransportation  cost,  and  achieve  greenhouse  gas  reductions,  among  other  environmental \nbenefits.5 The project will contribute as a pilot project to the development of a nationwide \nframework for sludge management by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, \nsupported by an ADB ongoing advisory technical assistance study\u2014Urban Wastewater Reuse \nand Sludge Utilization Policy Study.6 \n \n8.  The project will also pioneer the optimization of WWTPs\u2019 performance. This task will be \ncarried out for the whole of Wuhan. It will improve the performance of infrastructure financed by \ntwo previous ADB projects (Wuhan Wastewater Management Project and Wuhan Wastewater \nand Stormwater Management Project [WWSMP]) in Wuhan. The core task will be to ensure the \nsteady performance of the WWTPs, to achieve design effluent parameters, as well as improve \nsludge quality for its beneficial disposal. \n \n9.  Lakes and rivers represent 25% of Wuhan\u2019s urban area. They are part of a complex \nwater system within the vast Jianghan flood plain, naturally connected to the Han and the \nYangtze rivers. This water system and its natural water circulation sustain the healthy condition \nof  lakes.  In  recent  years,  however,  agricultural  activity,  urban  construction  boom,  and \nenvironmental neglect altered the area. These caused the disappearance of many lakes, the \nblocking of connection channels, and restricting of hydraulic circulation. Of the nearly 100 lakes \nexisting in Wuhan City in the middle of the 20th century, only 38 remain. The pollution impact of \nhuge amounts of wastewater previously discharged on the aquatic environment was amplified \n                                                 \n3  Incineration greatly reduces the volume of wastewater sludge and can take advantage of the calorific content in \nthese materials. However, it requires large capital investments in infrastructure and high operational costs, and \nrequires additional fuel\u2014usually fossil fuel\u2014to create the burn. Incinerators in more developed countries are \nsubject to increasingly strict air pollution control standards, which require increased complexity and costs. \n4  See Tang Mountain rehabilitation subcomponent (para. 14). \n5  The main benefits can be quantified as follows: (i) reduction of the annual landfill space capacity by 78,629 cubic \nmeters (m3) per year; (ii) prolongation of the existing landfill service life of 16 years for the Cangshankou landfill \nsite;  and  (iii)  saving  the  transportation  cost  of  CNY2.15  million  per  year  and  the  landfill  disposal  cost  of \nCNY2.36 million per year. \n6  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Urban Wastewater Reuse and Sludge \nUtilization Policy Study. Manila (TA 7083-PRC). ", "3 \nbecause of water stagnation. The result is a degraded urban environment as well as reduced \nassimilative and hydraulic capacity of surface water to handle pollution and flood events. The \npollution has reached 56% of the local rivers and 89% of the lakes. Wuhan lakes\u2019 water quality \nis currently measured at classes IV\u2013V or worse. \n \n10.  The  project  will  address  key  ecological  and  social  needs  to  restore  the  ecological \ncapacity, the natural hydraulic circulation, and water quality in urban surface water systems. It \nwill increase water system resilience and promote integrated surface water management to \nimprove the urban environment and reduce the risk of flooding. The project will unblock the \nchannels connecting the lakes, and support the construction of wetlands to increase water \nregeneration and flood retention capacities in the Hanyang and Wuchang areas. In parallel, it \nwill promote point source and nonpoint source pollution control, raise community environmental \nawareness, and conduct institutional strengthening. The creation of healthy and well-managed \nwater systems in Wuhan will allow urban expansion in flood-safe and environmentally clean \nareas to support the city\u2019s sustainable development. The Yangtze flood plain area where Wuhan \nCity is located is significantly vulnerable to climate change. The project will allow the restoration \nof the retention capacity of lake areas to mitigate climate change impacts and increase the \nresilience of the city to natural hazards, such as floods and drought, associated with climate \nchange. \n \n11.  The project, which builds on experience of lake rehabilitation in the PRC,7 will be a \nmodel for lake rehabilitation and integrated surface water management in Wuhan and for the \nentire country. In addition, the project will support the development of a water quality model that \nwill assist in long-term planning, water quality assurance and forecast, promoting water balance \nand emergency response.8 \n \n12.  The  project  will  enhance  environmental  awareness  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure  investments  and  to  maximize  long-term  social  benefits.  The  environmental \nawareness program will focus on three stakeholders who generate and are affected by point \nand nonpoint source pollution: (i) small businesses operating adjacent to the lake system, \n(ii) communities living in the project area, and (iii) schoolchildren in the project area. This \nprogram will help ensure that regulatory practices are well understood and that necessary \nbehavior  changes  regarding  nonpoint  source  pollution  are  addressed.  A  capacity  building \nsubcomponent will support further tariff reforms and will conduct a willingness-to-pay survey for \nsludge tariff setting in selected focus group and communities. These initiatives will assist WMG \nto achieve full cost recovery of both wastewater and sludge management services over the \nmedium term (2018). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  impact  of  the  project  is  improved  urban  environment,  public  health,  and  living \nconditions in Wuhan Municipality. The outcome of the project is integrated urban water resource \nmanagement, and wastewater sludge treatment and disposal in Wuhan Municipality. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004.

Outputs \n14.  Component 1: Integrated sludge treatment and disposal component will provide facilities \nable  to  treat  sludge  produced  by  six  of  Wuhan\u2019s  WWTPs.  The  Sanjintan  WWTP  Biogas \nUtilization and Sludge Drying Plant will support biogas utilization from the Sanjintan WWTP \nsludge digestion to dry its own sludge and the sludge of other WWTPs. The dried sludge will be \nsent to the nearby fertilizer plant for reuse as soil conditioner. The existing WWTP9 units include \nthe anaerobic digestion facility commissioned in August 2009. The sludge design treatment \ncapacity is 100 t/d. The Tangxunhu WWTP Sludge Drying Plant will support the sludge drying \nfacility of 200 t/d capacity for two WWTPs. After the extension of the nearby Baoxie WWTP, its \nraw sludge will also be treated by the sludge facility. The sludge will be disposed of as fill-in \nconstruction material, for soil remediation, and as soil conditioner. The steam for sludge drying \nwill be supplied by the nearby Gaoxin Heat Power Plant. The Nantaizihu WWTP Sludge Lime \nStabilization Plant will support the sludge lime stabilization facility with the treatment capacity of \n50 t/d. The stabilized sludge will be utilized for the Tang Mountain soil remediation10 or as \nbuilding  material.  The project  will modify  and  improve  existing  sludge  treatment  in  related \nWWTPs to meet project needs and the respective requirements of the drainage company. The \nproject will also provide sludge transportation trucks and laboratory instruments to monitor and \nanalyze the quality of dried sludge. \n \n15.

The proposed implementing agency is already responsible for implementation of the \nWWSMP. Upon completion, project facilities will be handed over to the relevant government \ndepartment or public utility that will act as operational unit for facilities responsible for operation \nand maintenance.12 Both Wuhan Project Management Office and Wuhan Urban Construction \nFunds Management Office are involved in implementation of the ongoing WWSMP; financial \nassessments have previously been performed on both organizations and they have been found \nto be satisfactory. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n23.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  over  3  million  urban  residents  by  improving  living \nconditions, public health standards, and the urban environment of Wuhan municipality resulting \nfrom  (i)  proper  treatment  and  disposal  of  sludge  from  WWTPs,  (ii)  reduced  pollution  and \nimproved management of surface water bodies in two newly developed areas, and (iii) improved \nprotection from flooding and associated hazards. The project will have a high impact on climate \nchange adaptation and mitigation. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n24.  A  financial  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  of  the  revenue-generating  sludge  treatment  and \ndisposal component confirmed financial viability by concluding that the component\u2019s financial \ninternal rate of return (7.4%) exceeded the weighted average cost of capital (3.3%). A sensitivity \nand risk analysis revealed that the component\u2019s financial internal rate of return is most sensitive \nto revenue variations\u2014hence, timely tariff adjustments and/or the availability of government \nsubsidies,  as  proposed,  will  be  crucial.  A  financial  analysis  of  Wuhan  Urban  Drainage \nDevelopment Company (WUDDC) evaluated existing tariff and cost-recovery arrangements, \nand concluded that the proposed WMG subsidies to WUDDC will be required in the short- to \nmedium-term  as  full  cost  recovery  is  unrealistic  in  the  short  term.  WMG  will  contribute \ncounterpart  funding,  service  loans,  and  shoulder  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  the \nnonrevenue-generating components. A fiscal analysis indicated that WMG\u2019s annual contribution \nthrough its Wuhan Urban Development Fund will not exceed 7.6% of annual revenues, over the \nprojection  period  (2010-2019).  Therefore,  the  nonrevenue-generating  components  are \nconsidered both financially sustainable and affordable. A financial management assessment \nconcluded  that  Wuhan  Project  Management  Office  and  the  implementing  agency  are \nexperienced  in  managing  ADB  projects  and  are  prepared  for  project  implementation.  The \nfinancial management assessment identified several issues that will be addressed, including the \nneed for financial management training for new staff.13 \n \n25.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that  project \ncomponents are the least-cost options in support of Wuhan\u2019s long-term development plans. The \nproject economic internal rate of return is computed at 20.48%, which exceeds the economic \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%. The result is robust relative to the normal range of sensitivity \nanalyses.  Quantifiable  economic  benefits  identified  for  the  sludge  component  are  (i)  land \nsavings from prolonged landfill life, (ii) incremental landfill operation cost savings, (iii) fertilizer \nsavings from applying sludge as a soil conditioner, and (iv) fuel savings from using biogas. \nQuantifiable economic benefits of the lakes and channels rehabilitation components include \n                                                 \n12  There are three operating units: (i) Wuhan Urban Drainage Development Company (WUDDC) for the sludge \ntreatment and disposal component, (ii) Hanyang District Water Bureau for the Wuhan New Zone lakes/channels \nrehabilitation and pumping stations, and (iii) Yangchun Lake New District Water Bureau for the Yangchun lake \nsecondary urban center lakes/channels rehabilitation. \n13  A summary financial analysis and financial management assessment is in Appendix 2 (Financial Analysis and \nFinancial Management Assessment). \n ", "8   \n(i) increased land and real estate values, (ii) health benefits, (iii) recreation and pedagogical \nvalue of wetland parks, and (iv) flood risk reductions.14  \n \nB.  Governance \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and WMG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The project area of Hanyang, Hongshan, and Wuchang districts covers 698.5 square \nkilometers  (km2).  In  2007,  701,300  households  and  a  population  of  2,618,000\u2014including \n27,483 poor  households  (3.92%)\u2014inhabited  the  area.  The  average  income  per  capita  per \nmonth was CNY1,196.5 and the unemployment rate was 4.2%.15 \n \n28.  Health impacts. Potential health hazards from improper disposal of WWTP sludge will \nbe greatly reduced. A health impact assessment was conducted during project preparation. \nBenefits  from  a  reduction  of  morbidity  and  mortality  from  waterborne  carcinogenic  and \nnoncarcinogenic diseases for local residents will also accrue under the lakes and channels \nrehabilitation components. Public health indicators will be monitored during implementation. \n \n29.  Employment impacts. The project will directly generate about 3,245 full-time positions16 \n(38,935 person-months) during construction (3 years) and 144 full-time positions17 during the \noperations  phase.  It  will  indirectly  generate  about  1,841  positions18 per  year.  Employment \ntargets for local unskilled workers, women, and vulnerable groups and core labor standards \nhave been included in the social action plan and gender action plan (Appendix 2) and will be \nmonitored. HIV, AIDS and sexually transmitted infection awareness training will be included in \ncontractor bidding documents and monitored during implementation. \n \n30.  Gender impacts. The project has been designed as effective gender mainstreaming. \nWomen focus group discussions found that environmental improvements are anticipated to \nhave a significant gender impact, with reduced time burdens and costs for healthcare and \nenvironmental cleanup. Women are usually in charge of household budgets for utilities and \nexpressed greater knowledge about fees. A total of 94.8% expressed willingness to participate \nin environmental and health awareness projects in addition to tariff programs planned by the \nproject.19 \n \n31.  Public  awareness  impacts.  Two  public  awareness  programs\u2014environmental  and \nhealth  awareness  and  public  consultation  for  tariff  increases\u2014will  be  supported  under  the \ncapacity building component. These will help sustain the positive impacts of infrastructure and \nrehabilitation.  The  environmental  and  health  awareness  program  will  focus  on  three \nstakeholders that generate and are affected by point and nonpoint source pollution: (i) small \nbusinesses  adjacent  to  the  lake  system,  (ii)  communities  living  in  the  project  area,  and \n                                                 \n14  A summary economic analysis is in Appendix 2 (Economic Analysis). \n15  The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n16  Providing total gross income of CNY143 million. \n17  Providing total gross annual income of CNY7.722 million. \n18  Totaling CNY77.335 million gross annual income. \n19 The gender action plan ensures (i) women\u2019s employment in the project; (ii) participation and gender-sensitive \ntraining in environmental awareness and public health programs, and outreach for public participation in the tariff \nreform program; and (iii) appropriate gender targets, indicators, and sex-disaggregated data for project monitoring \nand evaluation.  ", "9 \n(iii) schoolchildren in the project area. This program will help to ensure that regulatory practices \nare well understood and that necessary behaviour changes regarding nonpoint source pollution \nare  addressed.  The  program  will  be  coordinated  with  existing  environmental  awareness \nprograms run by the Environmental Protection Bureau, local nongovernmental organizations, \nand community-based associations and schools. \n \n32.  Stakeholder  consultation.  During  project  preparation,  local  government  and  line \nagencies, villagers, enterprises, local groups, and other people likely to be directly affected by \nthe project were consulted. A total of 504 households and 100 businesses were surveyed during \nproject preparation. Consultations indicate that the project has a high level of public support. A \nconsultation and participation plan for the project has been prepared.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n33.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  impact.  The  land \nacquisition and resettlement impact for the project will be significant. Only components 2 and 3 \nof the project will entail land acquisition and resettlement impacts. Hongshan and Hanyang \ndistricts  will  be  directly  affected  by  the  project,  involving  three  street  committees  and  16 \nadministrative villages. In total, about 3,423.55 mu20 of land will be permanently acquired and \n555.60 mu will be occupied temporarily. There will be demolition of 126,536 square meters (m2) \nof residential houses and 31,957 m2 of nonresidential houses. In total, 376 households with \n1,365 persons will be affected directly by land acquisition and house demolition. Another 22 \naffected  enterprises,  institutions  involving  33 employees,  and  14  shops  will  also  suffer \ndemolition impacts. The current resettlement budget for the project is CNY1.5 billion, including \nland acquisition, relocation compensation, and all other associated costs. The resettlement \nplans  were  disclosed  in  local  language  to  affected  districts  and  villages,  and  resettlement \ninformation  booklets  were  distributed  to  the  affected  persons.21 The  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement costs will be financed by WMG and the loan from the Agricultural Bank of China. \nOn the impact on indigenous peoples, the project is classified as category C. \n \n34.  Environmental aspects. The project is classified category A in ADB\u2019s environmental \ncategorization. Four environmental impact assessments (EIAs) were prepared, one for each of \nthe three main structural components, together with the EIA for Sixin pumping station. Extensive \npublic consultation involving surveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions \nwas undertaken during the preparation of each EIA. The EIAs are based on national laws, \nregulations, and standards applicable in the PRC. \n \n35.  The summary EIA is based on four PRC EIA reports prepared by an accredited local \nenvironmental research institute, and complies with the PRC\u2019s environmental policy, and ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  It  concludes  that  the  project  will  have  substantial  positive \nenvironmental and socioeconomic benefits resulting from (i) proper treatment and disposal \ntechnologies  and  facilities  for  sludge  from  the  existing  WWTPs  and  effectively  prevented \nsecondary pollution from the sludge; (ii) unblocked silted lakes and channels, enhanced water \ncirculation and self-purification, restored ecosystems, and the biological diversity of the water \nbodies; (iii) increased real estate values; and (iv) reduced greenhouse gases emission by \nsludge  anaerobic  digestion  and  biogas  generation  and  use.  By  facilitating  economic \ndevelopment, the project will provide lasting benefits to assist in poverty reduction. The specific \nenvironmental concerns of the project include odor and secondary pollution from the WWTP \n                                                 \n20  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n21  Two full resettlement plans have been prepared and the involuntary resettlement assessment and measures is in \nAppendix 2. \n ", "10   \nsludge and dredged sediments, and water quality deterioration of the Yangtze River and project \nlakes and channels. Such concerns have been fully addressed in the tables of potential impacts \nand  mitigation  measures  and  the  environmental  monitoring  program.  A  detailed  training \nprogram for capacity building has been developed in the environmental management plan to \nensure the borrower\u2019s institutional capacity in managing environmental impacts and risks. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The  project  has  no  unusual  technical  risks.  The  river  and  channel  rehabilitation \ncomponents will be implemented using well-established technologies and methods. Sludge \ndrying technology is relatively new in the PRC but well proven internationally, with several \ninternational equipment providers active in the PRC. The sludge component equipment will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  and  consultants  will  support  the \nimplementing agency and the design institute in equipment specification, commissioning, and \noperational capacity building. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nResistance by some stakeholders to resettlement  Adherence to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and \nSafeguards Policy Statement (2009), which provides for full and \nearly consultation with affected persons \nImproved lake water circulation leads to additional  Capacity building initiatives funded from the loan to (i) improve \npollution entering the Yangtze river  surface water management systems by utilizing water quality \n  modeling; and (ii) enhance public awareness, environmental \nContinued dumping of waste by local residents and  monitoring, and the development of strategies for pollution source \nfailure to enforce all applicable environmental laws  control \nFailure of WMG to increase tariffs to meet cost  Assurances from WMG in conducting regular tariff reviews and \nrecovery targets for wastewater services  adjustments \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WMG = Wuhan municipal government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n37.  The government and WMG  have  assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n38.  The government and WMG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Wuhan  Urban  Environmental \nImprovement Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n8 June 2010 ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact    Environmental monitoring  Assumptions \nImproved urban  Water quality of project lakes and  data of Wuhan EPB   Wuhan master plan and \nenvironment, public  channels is improved to at least class    sector master plans for \nhealth, and living  IV, and the biological diversity within  Environmental monitoring  infrastructure are \nconditions in Wuhan  the project lakes, including the aquatic  data of Wuhan EPB and  effectively implemented  \nMunicipality  vegetation, is rehabilitated by 2020  public health   \n    organizations   All applicable local and \nIncidence of waterborne infectious    national environmental \ndiseases reduced 30% from 2009  Wuhan Health Bureau  laws in the PRC are \nlevel by 2020  and Wuhan Center for  effectively enforced. \n  Disease Control   \nIncreased investment and business    Risks \nopportunities with increased gross  Monitoring from public  River water quality \ndomestic product rising annually by  awareness program on  monitoring data does not \n15% from 2015 in the project area  tariff reform  provide sufficient \n    information to detect \nWuhan Statistical  trends. \nYearbook   \nWeak enforcement of the \nrelevant national and \nlocal environmental laws \nand regulations \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIntegrated wastewater  More than 50% of urban WWTP  Sludge quality and  Infrastructure assets are \nsludge treatment and  sludge will be treated and disposed of  quantity monitoring data,  properly maintained. \ndisposal, and urban  in an economically and  and sludge reduction and   \nwater resource  environmentally sustainable way by  reuse data  Adequate enforcement of \nmanagement in Wuhan  2015, extending landfill life.    nonresidential connection \nMunicipality    Environmental monitoring  and pretreatment \nReduction of the annual landfill space  reports and periodic  requirements \ncapacity by 78,629 m3 per year, and  review of sludge disposal   \nprolonging the existing landfill service    Proper control of nonpoint \nlife of 16 years for the Changshankou  Statistical data from  and point source pollution \nlandfill site  Wuhan Municipal    \n  Management Bureau and  Government support for \nImprovement of operation and  Wuhan Sanitation Bureau  tariff increase \nmaintenance performance of WWTPs     \nwill decrease inorganic matter in the  Day-to-day operation and  WWB acquires the \nsludge by 25% by 2015.  maintenance report  resources and \n    responsibility to monitor \nThe overall wastewater service,  Periodic tariff reviews   local flooding. \ninclusive of sludge treatment,     \nachieves full cost recovery by 2018  Wuhan EPB monitoring  EPB enforces \n    environmental monitoring \nThe frequency of disruption and  WWB statistics  standards. \ndamage caused by local storm water     \nflooding is reduced by more than 50%  WWB statistics on flood  Customers are willing to \nin Wuhan New Zone by 2015.  frequency and damage   pay increased tariffs. \n     \n  Environment monitoring  Risks \nreports  Lack of effective \ncoordination and \nmonitoring mechanisms \nof relevant agencies on \nenvironmental protection \nand management \n \n \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImproved lake water \ncirculation leads to \nadditional pollution \nentering the Yangtze. \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
