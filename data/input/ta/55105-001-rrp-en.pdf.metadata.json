THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Build Universal Health Care Program, and (ii) a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the Build Universal Health Care \nProgram.1 The report also describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to \nbe provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Supporting Building Up Universal Health \nCare, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed program is designed to help improve equitable access to quality health \nservices. It is aligned with the country\u2019s development objectives of (i) health outcomes for all \nimproved, (ii) health care for all Filipinos at all life stages guaranteed, (iii) a responsive and \nresilient health system ensured, and (iv) equitable health financing sustained.2 The program \ncomprises two subprograms with three key reform areas: (i) sustainable financing and strategic \npurchasing for universal health care (UHC), (ii) integrated delivery of quality health services, and \n(iii)  information  management  and  performance  accountability  for  UHC.3 The  programmatic \napproach will help ensure UHC policy reforms at the national and local levels implemented in a \nwell-sequenced and harmonized manner. The program is included in the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) country operations business plan for the Philippines, 2021\u20132023.4 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Economic and development performance. After averaging annual growth of 6.4% from \n2010\u20132019,  the  Philippine  economy  was  hit  hard  by  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic and contracted by 9.6% in 2020. The economic contraction persisted in the first quarter \nof 2021, with the economy declining by 4.2%. Unemployment soared to a record high of 17.6% \nin April 2020 before easing to 8.7% in October 2020. As of May 2021, unemployment declined \nfurther to 7.7%.5 General macroeconomic conditions and policies are still considered satisfactory, \nwith the economy projected to recover to 4.5% growth in 2021 with modest fiscal expansion.6 \nInfrastructure spending and social assistance are expected to drive this growth, supported by \nrising  COVID-19  vaccination  coverage  and  global  economic  recovery.  Inflation  has  been \nmanaged, averaging 3.0% from 2010\u20132019 and kept at 2.6% in 2020. The Philippines entered \nthe pandemic in a strong fiscal position. Tax reform had increased the ratio of tax to gross \n \n1  The Philippines\u2019 universal health care (UHC) program envisions every Filipino citizen being automatically opted into \nthe National Health Insurance Program (NHIP), financed by the government, NHIP, or private health insurance, with \nimmediate eligibility and access to preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative care for medical, \ndental, mental, and emergency health services. \n2  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2021.

The \nprogram was originally envisaged as a sector development program, but the government requested a programmatic \napproach and policy-based loans comprised of subprogram 1 in 2021 and subprogram 2 in 2023, reflecting the higher \nfinancing need, the importance of sequencing reforms, and the need for sustained support. ADB will also separately \nconsider an investment loan supporting UHC in 2023. \n5  Government of the Philippines, Philippine Statistics Authority. 2021.

The fiscal deficit averaged at a \nmanageable 2.4% in 2015\u20132019, and the ratio of government debt to GDP fell to a record low of \n39.6% in 2019. Government debt rose to equal 54.6% of GDP at the end of 2020 on higher \nborrowing. Average debt maturity has lengthened to reduce refinancing risks, and high-interest \ndebt securities were retired to lower debt servicing. Locally sourced financing accounts for three-\nfourths of the borrowing mix, reducing exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. \n \n4.  Health performance. Life expectancy at birth increased from 63.7 years in 1980 to \n71.2 years in 2019, and infant mortality per 1,000 live births decreased from 52.9 in 1980 to 21.6 \nin 2019.7 The share of deliveries at health facilities increased from 28% in 1993 to 78% in 2017, \nand the share of total births attended by skilled health providers rose to 84%.8 However, maternal \nmortality remained high at 121 per 100,000 live births in 2017 compared with Malaysia (29), \nThailand (37), and Viet Nam (43) (footnote 7). In addition, noncommunicable diseases accounted \nfor 68% of all deaths, at an estimated economic cost of \u20b1756.5 billion per year.9 \n \n5.  Development constraints. From a broader development perspective, the core problem \nin the health sector is inequitable access, geographically and financially, to high-quality and \nneeded  health  services.  Major  constraints  include  insufficient  government  financing  and \nuncoordinated health purchasing, inadequate and fragmented provision of health services, and \nweak health system information management and performance accountability at both the national \nand local government levels. The pandemic highlighted these constraints through insufficient \nhospital treatment capacity, poor contact tracing, and high hospital user fees.10 \n \n6.  Insufficient  and  nonstrategic  government  health  financing.  Current  health \nexpenditure (CHE)11 remained low at 4.1% of GDP in 2019 compared with the 2018 global \naverage of 9.8% and the middle-income country average of 5.1%.12 Although general government \nhealth expenditure\u2014comprising expenditure by the national and local governments and national \nhealth insurance\u2014increased as a percentage of CHE from 36.4% in 2014 to 42.0% in 2019, this \nis still lower than the 2018 global average of 59.5%. Increased government spending has been \npartly driven by allocating part of the excise tax revenues from tobacco and alcohol products to \nhealth, and by increasing the population coverage and raising the premium rates of the Philippine \nHealth Insurance Corporation (PHIC). However, local government spending on health remained \nlow at 8.4% of CHE in 2019, leading to a persistently high out-of-pocket expenditure (OPE) share \nof  47.9%  of  CHE.  High  OPE  has  contributed  to  catastrophic  and  impoverishing  health \nexpenditures and inequity.13 While, in the past, high OPE generally constrained health-seeking \nbehavior, it has led to inappropriate treatment of severe COVID-19 cases, with patients refraining \nfrom accessing care because of apprehension about costs and health care providers withholding \nmore intensive treatment.14 \n \n7.

Inadequate and fragmented provision of health services. Government and private \nhealth facilities are concentrated in urban areas. Limited access to well-equipped government \nhealth facilities forces many patients to use and pay for private health facilities, adding to their \nhigh individual OPE. Women consistently experience a higher OPE burden than men because of \nnoncoverage or limits on coverage of sexual and reproductive health  (SRH) services.17 In \naddition, many people forego medications because of high costs (footnote 13). About 47.2% of \nbarangays nationwide lacked health stations in 2019.18 Only 12 out of the total 81 provinces meet \nthe standard of one rural health unit for every 20,000 residents, and about 51.6% of all rural and \ncity health units need to be rehabilitated and equipped. Hospital capacity is limited, with only \n105,000 hospital beds nationwide and a bed density of 1.2 per 1,000 people, similar to the levels \nin low-income countries.19 The lack of primary care providers prevents many poor Filipinos from \naccessing health care services and has affected the ability of many local government units (LGUs) \nto conduct contact tracing of potential COVID-19 cases. \n \n9.  With devolution of health care services, the varying capacities and priorities of LGUs have \nresulted in different levels of investment in health. Weak health sector management capacities, \ninadequate  referral  systems,  and  a  lack  of  coordination  between  the  national  and  local \ngovernments and among LGUs have (i) negatively impacted health service delivery in many \nLGUs; and (ii) limited access to basic health services in many LGUs, particularly in geographically \nisolated and disadvantaged areas. With the Mandanas ruling, which expanded the resource base \nof revenue allotments to LGUs, the LGUs will have more resources to implement measures that \nwould improve the quality of local public service delivery, including health services delivery.20  \n \n10.  Weak  information  management  and  accountability  in  the  health  sector.  The \ngovernment has not fully applied information technology solutions to improve health systems and \noperations, compounding its inability to set up effective COVID-19 contact tracing and contributing \nto its delayed scale up of COVID-19 vaccination. Inadequate data sharing and lack of digital health \ninteroperability have contributed to weak accountability and performance management systems. \nAs a result, the performance and outputs of the Department of Health (DOH), the PHIC, LGUs, \nand hospitals are difficult to measure, monitor, and evaluate. Little information is available on the \ntypes of services available in different regions or on the distribution of health professionals. Health \n \n15 D.A. Watkins et al. 2018.

The Mandanas ruling mandates that the base national \ngovernment revenues against which the mandated 40% internal revenue allotments to LGUs are determined is not \nlimited to national internal revenue taxes collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue but includes all national taxes, \nincluding tariffs; customs duties; and other taxes, fees, and charges collected by agents of the national government, \nincluding the Bureau of Customs. As a result, the total national tax allotment to LGUs is expected to increase by \nabout 27.6% starting in 2022. \n \n ", "4 \ncontributions and adverse health impacts of health-sensitive projects and non-health projects in \nhealth-sensitive areas are also difficult to determine.21 \n \n11.  Strategic alignment. The government enacted the UHC Act on 20 February 2019 to \nensure equitable access to quality health services and financial risk protection for all Filipinos, \nenvisaging the implementation of a series of reforms over at least 6 years.22 The proposed \nprogram supports the implementation of reforms on health financing, health service delivery, and \nperformance monitoring needed to achieve UHC. It is also consistent with the development \nobjectives of the Updated Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022 (footnote 2). In addition, \nsupport for UHC aligns with the government\u2019s COVID-19 response, particularly in strengthening \ntreatment capacities and reducing uncertainty in paying for COVID-19 treatment. The program \nsupports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Philippines, 2018\u20132023\u2014specifically pillar 3 \non investing in people and its focus on social investments that will support human development \nand social protection.23 It is aligned with the following ADB Strategy 2030 operational priorities: \n(i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by supporting reforms to improve the \nquality and coverage of government and private health care services; (ii) accelerating progress in \ngender equality by promoting gender responsiveness in the health system; (iii) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability by \nsupporting climate- and disaster-resilient health services; and (iv) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity by increasing the implementation capacities of the DOH, the PHIC, and \nLGUs.24 The program will also support Sustainable Development Goals 1, 3, 5, 10, and 13.25 \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n12.  Government\u2019s reform strategy. The government aims to address the development \nconstraints in the health sector through the UHC Act, by strengthening health service delivery, \nhealth financing, and the performance accountability of population- and individual-based health \nservice providers in the national and local governments.26 It will strengthen LGU health systems \nby enhancing the coordination of LGU financing and health services delivery, with health care \nprovider networks and pooling of LGU health funds. The reform strategy has (i) mobilized \nincreased financing for health care and opted all Filipinos automatically into the National Health \nInsurance System, making primary care services accessible to every Filipino; (ii) organized \nnetworks of adequately financed and well-staffed government and private health care providers \nto efficiently deliver needed health services to all Filipinos, without financially overburdening \npatients; (iii) envisioned an interoperable national health information system that would inform \nhealth policies, decision-making, and implementation in the health sector; (iv) created a system \nof  accountability  by  the  DOH,  the  PHIC,  LGUs,  and  health  care  providers  for  efficient \nmanagement, quality care, and improved health outcomes; and (v) committed to a whole-of-\n \n21 Health-sensitive projects refer to projects whose raw materials, by-products, intermediate and finished products, and \nprocesses during construction, operation, and decommissioning pose significant health risks.

Individual-based health services are provided to individuals in health facilities or remotely. \n \n ", "5 \ngovernment approach led by the DOH and the PHIC with support from the Department of Finance \n(DOF) and other national agencies,27 LGUs, and the private sector. \n \n13.  The DOH calculated three cost scenarios to implement UHC based on the institutional \narrangement and the extent of UHC rollout. On average, the budgetary requirement for the DOH \nand the PHIC to implement UHC is about $7.40 billion for 2022, nearly double the combined 2021 \nbudget of the DOH and the PHIC of $3.95 billion.28 Using the UHC Act and the costing scenarios \nas the basis, the DOH and the PHIC have proposed a 2022 budget of $5.5 billion to accelerate \nUHC implementation. Although this is less than the budgetary estimates, the financing for 2022 \nis 40% higher than 2021, and this increase is expected to help accelerate the implementation of \nthe UHC reforms. In addition, LGUs are expected to increase their health financing to complement \nthe higher national financing. \n \n14.  Program  policy  reforms.  The  program  comprises  two  subprograms  covering  the \nfollowing reform areas: (i) sustainable financing and strategic purchasing for UHC, (ii) integrated \ndelivery  of  quality  health  services,  and  (iii)  information  management  and  performance \naccountability for UHC (Appendix 1). Subprogram 1 supported the initial set of UHC reforms that \nwill lead to universal population coverage and increased financing for UHC. It supported actions \nthat will begin addressing service delivery capacity gaps, promote service delivery networks, and \ninitiate the prioritization of primary care and health promotion. It also supported the strengthening \nof UHC-related information management and accountability mechanisms. All prior actions for \nsubprogram 1 have been completed. Subprogram 2 will support subsequent UHC reforms that \nwill ensure sustained universal population coverage and further increase financing for UHC. It will \nalso support expanding primary care and health promotion and enhancing the quantity and quality \nof  health  facilities  and  workers.  Furthermore,  it  will  support  nationwide  implementation  of \nintegrated interoperable health information systems, annual monitoring of UHC outputs and \noutcomes, and performance incentives for UHC-related performance of LGUs. \n \n15.  Reform area 1: Sustainable financing and strategic purchasing for universal health \ncare. This reform area ensures universal population coverage, increased financing for UHC, and \nthe implementation of strategic purchasing of health services focused on primary care services.29 \nThe reform measures are expected to reduce OPE for health and increase the health spending \nof national agencies, LGUs, and the PHIC, with significantly increased spending for primary care \nand  health  promotion.  Pooling  LGU-managed  funds  into  special  health  funds  and  gaining \nefficiencies by administering fewer funds are also expected to reduce cost wastage in the sector. \n \n16.  Under subprogram 1, the government has ensured universal population coverage by \nmandating the automatic inclusion and immediate eligibility of every Filipino in the National Health \nInsurance Program (NHIP). It increased sustainable financing for UHC by (i) increasing excise \ntaxes on alcohol and tobacco products and the revenues earmarked for UHC, (ii) imposing excise \ntaxes on heated tobacco and vapor products and earmarking them for UHC, and (iii) increasing \n \n27 These other national agencies include the Department of Budget and Management, Department of Information and \nCommunications Technology, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Social Welfare and \nDevelopment, Insurance Commission, National Economic and Development Authority, Philippine Amusement and \nGaming Corporation, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, and Philippine Statistics Authority. \n28 Government of the Philippines, DOH. 2020. Universal Health Care Medium Term Expenditure Program, 2020\u20132023. \nManila. \n29 Strategic purchasing of health services refers to how institutions, such as health ministries or departments, health \ninsurance agencies, and LGUs, that control pooled funds allocate the funds to health care providers, using \ninformation on health care providers and population\u2019s health needs, to maximize health outcomes. \n \n ", "6 \nthe funds earmarked for UHC from the excise taxes on sweetened beverages.30 This is expected \nto increase taxes earmarked for UHC from \u20b193 billion in 2020 to \u20b1137.07 billion in 2022 and \n\u20b1217.03 billion in 2023 (footnote 28). It strengthened strategic health purchasing by pooling local \nfunds into special health funds, which will finance the remuneration of additional health workers \nand incentives for all health workers, most of whom are women. The pooled local funds may \ninclude LGU health budgets, PHIC payments to LGU-managed health care providers, and LGU \nincome from other health services. Subprogram 1 expanded access to primary care services by \n(i) making Konsulta, the PHIC primary care benefit package that includes screening for cervical \nand breast cancer, available to all Filipinos; (ii) expanding the health services and medicines \ncovered by Konsulta; and (iii) including private health care providers as Konsulta providers. \nAdditional coverage under Konsulta includes medicines for ischemic heart disease, asthma, and \na number of infections; and tests for diabetes, and gastrointestinal and kidney diseases. \n \n17.  Subprogram 2 will ensure universal coverage of all Filipinos by sharing all UHC-related \ndata among the DOH, the Department of Social Welfare and Development, the Philippine \nStatistics Authority, and the PHIC. An updated health financing strategy prepared by the DOH \nand the PHIC will guide the sustained mobilization of financing for UHC and strengthen the \nexpenditure management of UHC spending by the DOH, the PHIC, LGUs, and other national \nagencies (footnote 27). Increased financing for UHC will come from the mandated transfer to the \nnational health insurance fund managed by the PHIC of (i) 50% of the national government\u2019s \nshare of the gaming income of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, and (ii) 40% \nof the charity fund of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). This transfer is projected \nto be around \u20b112.40 billion in 2022 and \u20b113.98 billion in 2023 (footnote 28). In addition, the DOH \nand the PHIC, in consultation with the Insurance Commission, will initiate the complementation of \nthe benefits of private health insurance providers with those of the PHIC. This will ensure that \n10.1% of CHE flowing through private health insurance supports the objectives of the UHC Act. \nFinally, rolling out the initial comprehensive PHIC outpatient benefit package with improved \nKonsulta and other outpatient benefits, and enabling diagnosis-related groups to pay for inpatient \ncare31 will strengthen strategic purchasing of health services. \n \n18.  Reform  area  2: Integrated  delivery  of  quality  health  services.  This  reform  area \nensures a responsive and resilient health system, including climate-smart, disaster-resilient, \nenvironmentally  sustainable,  and  gender-sensitive  health  facilities;  improves  coordination \nbetween public and private health care providers; increases the supply of health care workers, \nparticularly primary care workers; and broadens the delivery of health promotion services. The \nreform policies will contribute to increased supply of health facilities, including hospital beds and \nhealth workers; increase collaboration between health care providers and reduce redundancies \nin service delivery; and increase access to critical primary care services, including maternity care; \nand help reduce unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking. \n \n19.  Under subprogram 1, the government approved the implementation of the Philippine \nHealth Facility Development Plan (PHFDP) and rolled out its Health Care Waste Management \nManual.32 The PHFDP (footnote 19) institutionalized having at least one nurse or midwife per \nhealth station and birthing facility, recognizing the importance of each barangay\u2019s access to \n \n30 Republic Act No. 11346 approved on 25 July 2019 (An Act Increasing the Excise Tax on Tobacco Products, Imposing \nExcise Tax on Heated Tobacco Products and Vapor Products and Earmarking a Portion of the Total Excise Tax \nCollection for Universal Health Care, as amended by Republic Act No. 11467). \n31 Diagnosis-related groups pay fixed amounts for hospital care, based on costed payment categories and regardless \nof the actual costs incurred. \n32 Government of the Philippines, DOH. 2020. Health Care Waste Management Manual. Manila. \n \n ", "7 \nmaternal and child health care.33 The government issued guidelines and tools to support and \nfacilitate forming health care provider networks among LGUs and the private sector.34 It issued \nlicensing and accreditation rules for primary care providers and rules on providing telemedicine \nservices. These rules are expected to help expand primary care services, including family \nplanning services and women and child protection services. The government also institutionalized \nthe Health Promotion Framework Strategy, including SRH, safety, and inclusivity, consistent with \nthe UHC Act\u2019s vision of healthy living, schooling, and working environments. It enacted the Doktor \nPara  sa  Bayan  Act,  2020,  providing  scholarships  for  medical  students  and  return  service \nobligations.35 It institutionalized the deployment of the DOH-funded health human resources, \nprioritizing  support  for  underserved,  economically  underdeveloped,  conflict-affected,  and \ngeographically isolated and disadvantaged municipalities and provinces, including those with \nindigenous peoples\u2019 communities. With the focus on primary care and health promotion, provider \nnetworks, and a systematic approach to expanding health facilities and health workers, these \npolicy actions contribute to improving the coverage and quality of health services provided to all \nFilipinos. \n \n20.  Subprogram 2 will include policies to increase investments in climate-smart, disaster-\nresilient, environmentally sustainable, and gender-sensitive private and local government health \nfacilities. The DOH will incorporate, in the hospital and health facility licensing rules, compliance \nwith laws and guidelines such as the Climate Change Act of 2009,36 the Energy Efficiency and \nConservation Act of 2019,37 the Health Care Waste Management Manual, the PHFDP, climate \naction plans, and other related laws and policies. To increase the supply of primary care workers, \na primary care focus will be incorporated in all health degree and training programs of the DOH \nand the Commission on Higher Education, and primary care topics will be included in health \nprofessional licensure exams conducted by the Professional Regulation Commission. The DOH \nand the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) will take the lead on these \nchanges,  complemented  by  strengthened  training  programs  for  barangay  health  workers \ndeveloped by the DOH with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority. The DOH \nand DILG will also promote healthy cities, workplaces, and schools as they implement the Health \nPromotion Framework Strategy beyond the health sector. \n \n21.  Reform  area  3:  Information  management  and  performance  accountability  for \nuniversal  health  care.  This  reform  area  enables  interoperable  national  health  information \nsystems to inform health policies and decision-making processes; increases the accountability of \nkey UHC implementors; and strengthens the performance monitoring of policy implementation in \nthe health sector. The reform policies will increase the use of digital tools in the sector, contributing \nto timely performance monitoring and information-driven implementation of UHC interventions by \nthe DOH, the PHIC, LGUs, other government agencies, and the private sector. \n \n22.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government,  through  the  DOH  and  the  PHIC,  mandated \ngovernment and private entities with health information systems to comply with the national health \ndata standards for interoperability, which will lead to an integrated health information system, and \n \n33 The PHFDP also mandates barangay health stations and birthing facilities providing services for family visits. \nPolyclinics serving as intermediate care between primary care facilities and hospitals must contain outpatient \nspecialty care, including obstetrics-gynecology services. \n34 Health care provider networks are groups of primary to tertiary care providers (whether public, private, or mixed) \noffering comprehensive care in an integrated and coordinated manner. \n35 Republic Act No. 11509 approved on 23 December 2020 (Act Establishing a Medical Scholarship and Return \nService).  \n36 Republic Act No. 9729 approved on 23 October 2009 (Climate Change Act of 2009). \n37 Republic Act No. 11285 approved on 12 April 2019 (Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act). \n \n ", "8 \nto submit health and health-related data. The government improved technical and gender parity \nin supervising the PHIC by adding, as new PHIC board members, three experts for public health \nmanagement, finance, and health economics and requiring that at least one of these three experts \nand at least two of the five sector board members be female (para. 38).38 Finally, the DOH and \nDILG conducted health impact assessments of development projects to evaluate their health \nimpacts on different economic sectors before, during, and after implementation. These impacts \nrange from positive to negative and may affect different segments of the population, including the \nelderly, pregnant and lactating women, children, people with disability, and indigenous peoples. \n \n23.  In subprogram 2, the government will implement gender-sensitive annual household \nsurveys and reviews of UHC, conduct burden of disease and health expenditure studies, and \nmake health and UHC data public.39 The DOH and DILG will also implement improved UHC-\nrelated performance metrics for LGUs from the LGU Health Scorecard and Seal of Good Local \nGovernance with performance-based incentives to LGUs. This will include gender-related UHC \nindicators in the LGU Health Scorecard, such as the modern contraceptive prevalence rate and \nadolescent birth rate, to be reported by municipalities, highly urbanized cities, and provinces. In \naddition, the DOH, the Department of Information and Communications Technology, and the \nPHIC will validate conformance and interoperability standards. \n \nBox: Key Accomplishments of Subprogram 1 \n \nBy the end of May 2021, \n\u2022  The Philippines achieved universal population coverage by automatically including all \nFilipinos for immediate coverage under the National Health Insurance Program, with around \n95 million already registered in the database of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation \n(PHIC).   \n\u2022  Fifty eight local government units (LGUs) or groups of LGUs have begun organizing health \ncare provider networks and special health funds. \n\u2022  LGUs are allocating financial and other resources for health promotion including for child \nvaccination (Chikiting Ligtas) and COVID-19 response (Resbakuna program to encourage \nfull vaccination and BIDA Solution to promote the active role of individuals and practices to \nprevent infection). \n\u2022  Around 26,000 Department of Health-funded human resources for health are deployed to \naugment primary care delivery of LGUs.  \n\u2022  There are 9,350 hospitals, primary care facilities and other health facilities submitting health \nand health-related data to the PHIC, with 135 PHIC-accredited primary care providers \nimplementing electronic medical records.   \n \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Department of Health, PHIC. \n \n24.  Sustainability of reforms. The program will support the government in achieving and \nsustaining increased levels of financing for UHC, expanding the supply and integration of health \ncare providers, and enhancing health system efficiency with strategic and coordinated health \nspending.  It  will  also  enhance  the  use  of  digital  tools  in  the  health  sector,  improve  the \nimplementation capacity of the DOH and the PHIC, and strengthen collaboration with other \n \n38 Each of the five sector board members represents a stakeholder or a sector: (i) indirect contributors, (ii) direct \ncontributors, (iii) employers, (iv) health care providers, and (v) local chief executives. \n39 The annual household surveys will incorporate a gender-sensitive lens in the survey instrument. Among others, the \nindicators will consider the different roles, responsibilities, and access to resources of the respondents; recognize \ntheir different health-related needs depending on their biological functions and lifestyle; disaggregate data by sex, \nage, and other variables; and identify households headed by women. \n \n ", "9 \ngovernment agencies and the private sector. Support for local UHC reforms will help sustain these \nreforms in LGUs. The whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches are expected to \nensure these policy reforms are sustained after the end of the program.40 Institutionalizing UHC-\nrelated performance monitoring of national agencies and LGUs in subprogram 2 will also help \nsustain the policy reforms. \n \n25.  ADB value addition. ADB has been engaged in sustained policy dialogue with the \ngovernment in formulating and guiding the reform agenda throughout. Through the provision of \nTA,  ADB  supported  the  development  of  the  updated  PHFDP;  health  impact  assessment \nguidelines;  and  policy  reforms  in  health  service  delivery,  health  financing,  and  information \nmanagement (Figure). The TAs supported the DOH and PHIC in accelerating policy reforms in \nhealth promotion, interoperability of health information systems, primary care, and strategic \npurchasing.41 ADB brings its experience in supporting other developing member countries to \ndesign and implement health financing, health service delivery, and digital health innovations.42 \nThe COVID-19 response projects;43 the contingent disaster financing project, which includes \nhealth emergencies as a trigger;44 planned health projects, including a project strengthening \nhealth service delivery in tourism sites;45 and ongoing and planned TA,46 including the attached \nTA (para. 33), complement the support for UHC reforms by directly or indirectly financing \ninvestments in health service delivery and providing technical inputs for improving health systems. \n \n26.  ADB sector experience and lessons learned. ADB\u2019s TA support (footnote 41) and the \nCOVID-19 response grant and loan projects (footnote 43) marked the return of ADB support for \nthe health sector in the country after ADB\u2019s last health project in 2009. These TA and loan projects \nsignal the start of ADB\u2019s long-term support for the sector, consistent with Strategy 2030 priorities. \nThe program design has incorporated insights from the implementation of these new health \nprojects and lessons from previous ADB projects in the sector47 with respect to achieving a \nbalance  between  decentralized  health  systems  and  a  whole-of-government  approach  to \nimplement reforms, such as UHC.48 The design of the proposed program incorporates the lessons \nlearned by engaging several national agencies, LGUs, and the private sector to achieve UHC. \n \n40 The government\u2019s UHC policy reforms involve several national agencies and LGUs, the private health sector, the \nacademe, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders. \n41 ADB.

Development partner coordination. ADB coordinates closely, both in health sector \nsupport and in specific UHC policy actions, with the World Health Organization, the United States \nAgency for International Development, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and other \ndevelopment partners providing technical support to the DOH and the PHIC. Development partner \ncoordination is led by the DOH\u2019s Bureau of International Health Cooperation and the PHIC\u2019s \nInternational and Local Engagement Department. ADB will support the planned Philippine Health \nDevelopment Cooperation mechanism, which will guide the collaboration and partnership with \ninternational health partners to align development assistance with the health sector\u2019s thrusts, \ndirections, and processes, particularly UHC implementation. In addition, ADB is coordinating with \nthe International Monetary Fund with respect to macroeconomic and fiscal assessments. \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n28.  The program is aligned with the country\u2019s development objectives: (i) health outcomes for \nall improved, (ii) health care for all Filipinos at all life stages guaranteed, (iii) responsive and \nresilient health system ensured, and (iv) equitable health financing sustained (footnote 2). The \nprogram outcome will be equitable access to quality health services improved. Key measures of \nthis outcome include reduced OPE for health, increased availability of health care providers, and \nwidespread use of digital tools and information-driven UHC implementation.49 \n \n29.  The universal population coverage in the NHIP, strategic health purchasing, increased \nsupply of health facilities and workers, and related UHC reforms are expected to increase access \nto health services and improve health outcomes. Comprehensive UHC reforms in Turkey and \nThailand, which adopted universal population coverage coupled with supply-side reforms, led to \n \n49 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "11 \na significant reduction in mortality among vulnerable populations.50 Universal NHIP population \ncoverage with improved health insurance benefits is expected to reduce OPE for health. A \nmultiple regression analysis of Philippine survey data suggests that expanding health insurance \namong the poor could reduce their hospital spending by 50%.51 Experiences from countries that \nadopted integrated care and primary care as part of their UHC reforms have also shown a large \nreduction in health care spending. A systematic review of available literature suggests that \nprimary care and integrated care could reduce the health care costs of several diseases by as \nmuch as 20%.52 The proposed program will support coordination among the various national \nagencies with their respective UHC-related efforts and assist the national government to engage \nLGUs and the private sector in UHC implementation. It will also help finalize and deepen UHC \nreforms by tracking the completion of the policy actions and their continued implementation. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n30.  The concept paper for the program envisaged a loan of $400 million for subprogram 1. \nThe government has requested for a loan of $600 million to support the implementation of \nsubprogram 1, reflecting the significant development financing needs, the development impact \narising from the policy reform package, and the comprehensiveness of the policy actions. It is \nfurther justified by the fiscal requirements for achieving UHC, the impact of the UHC reforms in \nimproving health outcomes and addressing health system constraints, and the substantial efforts \nthat government agencies are exerting in implementing the reforms. The indicative amount for \nsubprogram 2 will be $400 million (footnote 4). For 2021, the government\u2019s total gross borrowing \nrequirement is estimated to reach $62.3 billion, a significant increase from $20.1 billion in 2019. \nIncreased borrowing is needed to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 and to help finance \nthe fiscal deficit, equivalent to 9.3% of GDP.\u202fThe government plans to raise about $53.3 billion \nfrom the issuance of treasury bills and bonds, $3.2 billion from official development assistance, \nand $5.8 billion from external bonds. ADB\u2019s share of the development financing will be $1.4 billion. \n \n31.  The regular loan of $600 million will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an \nannual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity repayment method, the \naverage maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.  The DOF will be the executing agency, with the DOH and the PHIC as the primary \nimplementing agencies. A steering committee co-chaired by the DOF and the DOH, with members \nfrom the different government agencies supporting UHC (footnote 27), will provide oversight. The \nimplementation period is January 2019\u2013May 2021 for subprogram 1 and June 2021\u2013May 2023 \nfor subprogram 2. Subprogram 1 will have a single tranche disbursement of loan proceeds. The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n50 R. Cesur et al. 2017.

The  program  will  be  supported  by  an  attached  TA,  which  has  two  key  objectives: \n(i) supporting the local implementation of policy reforms achieved under subprogram 1, and \n(ii) providing policy advisory and technical assistance to define and finalize substantive and logical \npolicy measures for the subsequent set of UHC-related reforms under subprogram 2. The TA \noutputs are (i) increased financing and strategic purchasing for UHC strengthened, (ii) the quantity \nand quality of health facilities and workers increased, and (iii) access to primary care and health \npromotion services expanded. The TA will build on government efforts to advance UHC at the \nDOH\u2019s UHC Integration Sites, which are LGUs or groups of LGUs that have agreed with the DOH \nand the PHIC to adopt and implement UHC reforms as soon as possible.53 The TA is estimated \nto cost $2,050,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, office accommodation and supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions.54 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n34.  Poverty and social. The three reform areas complement each other in achieving the \noverall UHC goal. The reforms are expected to yield enormous societal benefits with (i) increased \naccess to essential health care services; (ii) improved financial protection, especially among the \npoor; and (iii) enhanced efficiency and cost savings in providing health care. Overwhelming \nempirical evidence demonstrates the positive impact of health insurance expansion (as part of \nany UHC reform) on health care access, particularly among the poor.55 An analysis shows the \npotential increase in outpatient care visits and skilled birth attendant rates. The percentage of \nhealth professional-attended births is expected to increase by 5 percentage points by 2024, with \na higher impact among the poor. Broader access to essential health care will greatly improve the \noverall health status of Filipinos. Experiences from other countries show the positive impact of \nhealth insurance expansion in reducing OPE. This reduction will help lower the number of Filipinos \nwho become impoverished because of excessive OPE for health services. \n \n35.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples \nsafeguards. The program is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguard impacts \nas described in the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).56 Subprogram 1 will generate significant \nenvironmental benefits. The updated PHFDP will make health facilities greener and safer. The \nissuance of the fourth edition of the Health Care Waste Management Manual, the establishment \nof health provider networks across provinces and cities, and the licensing of rural health units will \nhelp further improve infection prevention and control, emergency preparedness and response, \nand health care waste management practices. Institutionalizing health impact assessments for \nLGU development projects will help systematically identify, address, and minimize potential \nnegative impacts of development projects on public health and safety. The program will benefit \nindigenous people\u2019s communities especially under policy actions related to health care access. \n \n \n53 DOH. 2020.

Recognizing the vulnerability of the Philippines to natural hazards and \nclimate change, the government, through the DOF and the DOH, is committed to enhancing the \nclimate resilience and low-carbon development of the health sector. This aligns with the National \nClimate  Change  Action  Plan,  2011\u20132028;57 the Climate  Change  Act;  the  Paris  Agreement \ncommitments in the nationally determined contributions; LGUs\u2019 climate change action plans; and \nthe climate budget tagging systems of the Department of Budget and Management. The DOF and \nthe DOH consider subprogram 1 a continuing effort to enhance the country\u2019s low-carbon and \nclimate-resilient development. Of the 12 policy actions under subprogram 1, 11 have climate \nadaptation benefits, and one has climate mitigation benefits. Climate resilience and low-carbon \ndevelopment have been fully streamlined in the updated PHFDP. Subprogram 1 also enhances \nthe adaptive capacity of climate-vulnerable individuals and communities, especially those living \nin urban and geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas. Climate mitigation is estimated to \ncost $5 million, and climate adaptation is estimated to cost $105 million. ADB will finance 100% \nof mitigation and adaptation costs.58 \n \n37.  Gender. While the Philippines has significantly improved its health status since the 1980s, \nits maternal mortality ratio (para. 4) remained high, and the adolescent fertility rate (55%) was the \nhighest in Southeast Asia as of 2018.59 Among women aged 15\u201319, 9% had begun childbearing, \n7% had a live birth, and 2% were pregnant with their first child. Women make up a large portion \nof the informal sector and are usually employed in more insecure forms of work, which often lack \nsocial protection and access to health insurance.60 High health care OPE affects poor women the \nmost in both urban and rural areas.61 In addition, COVID-19 has adversely impacted women\u2019s \nvulnerabilities to gender-based violence, magnified the incidence of adolescent and unplanned \npregnancies, and increased the lack of availability of and access to SRH care services caused by \nquarantines  and  lockdowns.62 Quarantines  and  lockdowns  also  increased  the  workload  of \nbarangay health workers, who are 97% women, and highlighted the lack of consistent benefits \nand support because of their status as volunteers. \n \n38.  Subprogram 1 is classified effective gender mainstreaming. It will ensure that (i) primary \ncare benefits and access to health care providers are expanded to include the availability of and \naccess to services, such as screening for cervical and breast cancers; (ii) the DOH\u2019s updated \nPHFDP includes institutionalizing at least one nurse or midwife per health station and birthing \nfacility, recognizing the importance of providing every barangay access to maternal and child \nhealth care services; and mandating polyclinics serving as intermediate care between primary \ncare facilities and hospitals to provide outpatient specialty care, including obstetrics-gynecology \nservices; (iii) essential health services, such as SRH to women and adolescents, are provided \ncontinuously,  especially  during  pandemics  and  emergencies;  (iv)  the  Health  Promotion \nFramework Strategy is adopted, focusing on seven priority areas, including SRH and safety and \ninclusivity,  consistent  with  the  UHC  Act\u2019s  vision  of  healthy  living,  schooling,  and  working \nenvironments; and (v) the gender parity of the PHIC board is strengthened by requiring at least \none of the three technical experts and two of the five sector board members to be female. \n \n \n57 Government of the Philippines. 2011.

Governance. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment in 2016 noted \nimprovements to public financial management (PFM) and fiduciary arrangements, especially \npolicy-based budgeting, transparency, and asset\u2013liability management.65 The government used \nthese findings to improve PFM.

The cash-based budgeting system is based on annual cash payments \nfor contractual obligations in a fiscal year; and aims to incentivize government agencies to be \nmore  proactive  with  budget  planning,  costing,  and  the  timeliness  of  procurement  and \nimplementation.

It also encourages hospitals to be mother-baby friendly and mandates them \nto have rooming\u2013in and breastfeeding areas.   \nj  Health care provider networks are groups of primary to tertiary care providers (whether public, private, or mixed) offering comprehensive care in an integrated and \ncoordinated manner. \nk  Primary care services include services addressing the sexual and reproductive health needs of men and women including family planning services and women \nand child protection services.

Prior to \nthe UHC Act, all law governing the PHIC board did not provide for gender parity in board membership and composition. \nt    Each of the five sectoral board members represents a stakeholder or a sector: (i) indirect contributors, (ii) direct contributors, (iii) employers, (iv) healthcare \nproviders, and (v) local chief executives. \nu  The DOH-DILG Joint Administrative Order 2021-0001 on the guidelines for the operationalization of the health impact assessment review process for development \nprojects defines health impact assessment as a \u201cmeans of assessing the health impacts of policies, programs, and projects in diverse economic sectors before, \nduring, and after implementation.\u201d These impacts range from positive to negative and may affect different segments of the population, including the elderly, \npregnant and lactating women, children, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, and others. \nv  The National Health Data Standards for interoperability will be updated based on globally accepted updates and new and emerging best practices. Compliance \nwith the updates will be required as part of the mandatory adoption. \nw  The administrative registers or records and/or annual household surveys will incorporate gender-sensitive lens in the administrative/survey instrument. The \nindicators will consider, among others, the different roles, responsibilities, and access to resources of the respondents; recognize their different health-related \nneeds depending on their biological functions and lifestyle; disaggregate data by sex, age, and other variables; and identify female-headed households. \nx  The indicators in the scorecards recognize the different needs and experiences of males and females, such as the inclusion of indicators on access to primary \nsexual and reproductive health services. The LGU Health Scorecard specifically includes indicators on modern contraceptive prevalence rate and adolescent birth \nrate to be reported at the levels of municipals, highly urbanized cities, and provinces. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n ", "Appendix 2  23 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=55105-001-3 \n \n1.
