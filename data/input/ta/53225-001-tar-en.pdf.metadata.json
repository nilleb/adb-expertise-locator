THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  India grew at an average rate of more than 7% since fiscal year (FY) 2012, which placed \nit among the world\u2019s fastest growing large economies, and resulted in the rise of India\u2019s share in \nglobal gross domestic product  from 2.4% in 2013 to 3.0% in 2016.1 However, challenges remain, \nsuch as resolving infrastructure bottlenecks particularly for emerging urban growth centers as an \nengine of economic growth and center of commercial activities, and closing the widening gap \nbetween advanced and lagging regions where most of the poor are concentrated.  \n \n2.  The government\u2019s Strategy for New India @ 75 on surface transport aims to increase \nconnectivity and internal and external trade by expanding the road network through completing \n24,800 kilometers (km) by 2021\u20132022 including 2,000 km of coastal and port connectivity roads \nand doubling the length of national highways to 200,000 km by 2022\u20132023 from the existing \n122,000 km.2 Furthermore, to ease congestion in major urban areas, the strategy also aims to put \na metro network in place in all major urban areas under local governments. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provides support to India in developing the transport \nsector as a core infrastructure operation for inclusive economic growth. ADB interventions are \nfocused in lagging states with weak capacity in order to support the government\u2019s efforts to narrow \ninterstate and regional disparities, and have also increasingly shifted towards metro projects \nwhich are efficient in moving large numbers of people thus decongesting densely populated cities. \nSmaller and comparatively weaker states have lesser financial and technical capacity to prepare \nand implement projects. Many ongoing ADB-financed transport projects in India experience \ndelays that are mostly attributable to (i) project selection based on unclear parameters and \ndeficiency of capacity for carrying out financial sustainability and economic analyses; (ii) limited \nenvironmental and social safeguard considerations in selecting and preparing projects; and \n(iii) the gap  between  the feasibility  and  construction  phases  in  terms  of  project  readiness, \nincluding procurement. \n \n4.  Generally, in ADB-financed transport projects, the executing or implementing agencies \nprepare detailed project reports that are the basis for project appraisal, advance actions, and \napproval.  The  executing  and/or  implementing  agencies  and  its  consultants  have  adequate \ncapacity for preparing designs, drawings, specifications, and costing. In many cases, however, \nthe detailed project reports are deficient in various aspects\u2014financial and/or economic analysis, \nsocial and environmental safeguards, and procurement. The varying deficiencies often lead to \ndelay in project approval, low readiness, and deferred benefits to the targeted project users. \nDuring implementation, the ability to monitor results is also often found to be weak. \n \n5.  Enhancing and supplementing skills and competencies of executing and/or implementing \nagencies  is  needed  to  improve  project  preparation,  implementation,  and  overall  portfolio \nperformance. The proposed technical assistance (TA) facility will support government agencies \nto build upon the strengths gained from earlier TA resources to design, prepare and implement \nspecific transport infrastructure projects. The TA supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, by (i) addressing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

New \nDelhi. \n \n ", "2   \nremaining poverty and reducing inequality by providing connectivity and access to quality jobs, \neducation, training, health and social services; (ii) tackling climate change, building climate \nresilience and enhancing environmental sustainability; and (iii) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity by assessment of economic viability and financial sustainability of projects.3 \nThe TA facility is listed in the country operations business plan for India, 2019\u20132021, with the title \nPreparing Transport Sector Projects. 4 \n \n6.  The TA facility will support project preparation and increase project readiness of pipeline \nprojects including those identified in the country operations business plan. Initially, the TA facility \nwill support: \n(i)  Assam Road Network Improvement Project; \n(ii)  Bengaluru Metro Rail Project; \n(iii)  Bihar State Highways IV Project; \n(iv)  Chennai Metro Rail Project;  \n(v)  Indore Metro Rail Project;  \n(vi)  Maharashtra State Roads Improvement Project; \n(vii)  Second Uttarakhand State Highways Project;  \n(viii)  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  Highways  Project, \nPhase II; and \n(ix)  SASEC Road Connectivity Program (Tranche 3). \n \n7.  These projects, being in the transport sector, have similar due diligence requirements. The \nTA facility approach is suitable as it will (i) enhance project preparation efficiency and improve \nreadiness for projects that have limited processing resources; (ii) reap important synergies from \nworking with the same team of consultants; and (iii) strengthen coordination. Overall, this TA \nfacility will reduce transaction costs through minimizing the resources for stand-alone transaction \nTAs. \n \n8.  The TA facility  will  also  support  ongoing  projects  as  required  and  agreed  with  the \nrespective project\u2019s implementing agency. There are instances during project implementation \nwhere unanticipated scope and impacts are realized, hence, resources for additional assessment \nand  mitigation  are  deemed  necessary.  Ongoing  projects  that  suffer  from  weak  project \nimplementation capacity require similar technical support to ensure project sustainability and \nimprove transfer of capacity through specific training and skills building activities. Ongoing \nprojects that will be supported under the TA will be identified in consultation with the specific \nproject\u2019s implementing agency. Initially, the TA facility will support: \n(i)  Chhattisgarh Road Connectivity Project; \n(ii)  Karnataka State Highways Improvement III Project;  \n(iii)  Promoting Public\u2013Private Partnership in Madhya Pradesh Road Sector Project \n(after approval); and \n(iv)  SASEC Road Connectivity Program (Tranche 2). \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Procurement, financial and economic assessments completed. Technical \nexpertise  to  support  the  assessment  of  procurement  risk,  financial  management,  financial \nanalysis, and economic will be provided to prepare selected investment projects for potential ADB \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2018.

In addition, \nnecessary due diligence will be undertaken to identify enhancement measures for strengthening \npublic  consultations,  information  disclosure,  grievance  redress,  and  effective  institutional \narrangement. \n \n11.  Output 3: Capacity of implementing agencies for safeguards implementation and \nmonitoring improved. On a case by case basis, technical expertise and capacity building will be \nprovided to selected implementing agencies with ongoing or ensuing projects to enhance overall \nimplementation and sustainability of transport investments. Support will be provided through \nconsultants  with  focus  on  enhancing  quality  of  safeguard  implementation  and  monitoring, \nincluding support for additional surveys and/or studies, seminars, workshops and on-the-job \ntraining activities that will benefit implementing agency staff across multiple projects. \n \n12.  Output 4: Capacity of implementing agencies strengthened for preparation and \nimplementation of projects with finance-plus, high technology and innovative features. On \na case by case basis, technical expertise and capacity building will be provided to selected \nimplementing agencies with ongoing or ensuing projects to enhance finance-plus elements such \nas  road  safety,  asset  management,  operations  institutions  (for  metros),  transit-oriented \ndevelopment,  land-value  capture,  public-private  partnership,  high-technology,  and  other \ninnovative features of project design, implementation, and sustainability. Support will be provided \nthrough consultants by supporting additional surveys/studies, seminars, and workshops. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $2,750,000, of which $2,500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The value of the \ngovernment contribution is estimated to account for 10% (approximately $250,000) of the TA \nfacility cost, in the form of assigning counterpart staff, providing office accommodation, workshops \nand training facilities, and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. The TA facility scope is expected to be expanded to cover other additional activities, \nconsistent with the TA\u2019s outputs and outcome, and financial resources be replenished from time \nto time as funds are required and identified.  \n \n14.  The government agencies responsible for each project will provide counterpart support in \nthe  form  of  counterpart  staff  (including  their  renumeration,  per  diem  and  transport);  office \naccommodation; meeting, workshop and training facilities; project-related information; and other \nin-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, Government of India, will \nbe the executing agency of the TA facility. The government department or agency responsible for \neach project will be the implementing agency for the TA, subject to the approvals of DEA and \nADB. After the initial approval of DEA, ADB will work directly with the state line agencies of the \nprojects for all routine activities connected with the TA, such as but not limited to finalization of \nterms of reference, recruitment of consultants specific to the projects and preparation of reports. \nADB will administer the TA. The South Asia Transport and Communications Division will select \nand supervise the consultants and will closely coordinate with the executing and implementing \nagencies. \n \n16.  The  TA  facility  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  from  July  2019  to  June  2022. \nDisbursements under the TA facility will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  July 2019\u2013June 2022 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance \nImplementing agencies   Implementing agencies are the agencies that are preparing or implementing \ntransport projects. For practical purposes, the technical assistance (TA) will be \nmanaged by Asian Development Bank (ADB) in close coordination with the \nimplementing agencies. \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by implementing agency and ADB \n  Individual consultant selection  (56.5 person-months)  $ 1,050,000 \n(international) \n  Individual consultant selection  (71.5 person-months)  $ 350,000 \n(national) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or  None \ndisposal arrangement \nupon TA completion \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.  Consulting services. The TA facility will provide an initial 128.0 person-months of \nconsulting services (56.5 person-months international and 71.5 person-months national) in the \nfields of procurement, financial management, financial analysis, economic analysis, road safety, \nmetro,  bridge,  environmental  safeguards,  climate  change  assessment,  social  development \n(involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, gender and poverty assessment), specialized \nsupport for innovation and high-technology, and quality assurance.5 It is expected that the \nconsultants will be recruited using individual consultant selection method and deployed based on \nthe requirements of each project being prepared or implemented. ADB will engage the consultants \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions. Individual consultant selection is \nappropriate in this instance because the TA facility involves multiple activities that are not \nnecessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of expertise and services.  \n                                                \n5  TA facility savings may be utilized for additional consultant inputs, as may be necessary. \n ", "5 \n \nE.  Governance \n \n19.  Since ADB will administer the TA facility, the financial management, procurement capacity \nand integrity risks during TA facility implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough \nrisk assessments for procurement, financial management, and integrity for ensuing investment \nprojects will be conducted under the TA facility.  \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,500,000 on a grant basis to \nIndia for Strengthening Capacity to Design and Implement Transport Infrastructure Projects and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
