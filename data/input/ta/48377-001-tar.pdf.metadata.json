INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) capacity development technical assistance (TA) for the financing of \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs).  Following  fact-finding  in  October  2014,  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  reached  an  understanding  on  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, costs, and terms of reference.1 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Even as one of the world\u2019s fastest growing and largest economies by gross domestic \nproduct,2 the PRC faces many challenges in terms of equitable growth between its urban and \nrural  areas.  In  response,  it  has  undertaken  several  reforms  to  rebalance  growth  between \nregions and increase the availability of basic services to people. The needs are vast and involve \nnot just capital for building infrastructure but also skills to manage and operate efficient systems. \nPPPs can offer useful modalities to address some of these issues, and have been used in the \nPRC since the early 1990s to provide transport and communication services, energy, clean \nwater, wastewater treatment, and some social services.3 However, many \u2018build-transfer\u2019 projects \nwere  mistakenly  considered  as  \u2018PPPs\u2019,  and  many  PPPs  were  without  proper  concession \nagreements and value for money considerations. The \u2018private participants\u2019 were often state-\nowned and engaged without competitive bidding or negotiation process.  \n   \n3.  ADB has been a longstanding partner and helped develop the enabling environment for \nPPPs in the PRC. It has also been an active financier of the PRC\u2019s infrastructure PPPs. For its \npart, the PRC\u2019s commitment to improving PPPs continues to be reflected in recent policy \nstatements.  In November 2013, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee adopted the \nDecisions on Important Issues Concerning Comprehensive and Far-Reaching Reform, which \ncalled on the market to play a decisive role  in the PRC\u2019s development.4 PPPs provide a \nperformance-based  management  framework,  mobilize  additional  financial  resources  and \nexpertise from the private sector, and were endorsed as a way of extending the participation of \nthe private sector in the delivery of public services, improving the quality of public services, and \nhelping build a modern fiscal system to ensure fiscal sustainability and enhance transparency.5 \n \n4.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) released a landmark notice on PPPs in September 2014, \nrefining the approach to PPPs,6 and introduced many good international practices that will close \ngaps in the PRC\u2019s operational framework for PPPs. One aspect of PPPs that has, however, \nreceived less attention is the financing of PPP projects, in particular the facilitating role that \ngovernments may need to play. The notice favors projects that generate enough user revenue \nto fully meet project costs, but many potential PPPs cannot do so. Tariffs, fees, and tolls are \noften kept below full cost recovery for economic development or social reasons (e.g., waste \nwater and heating). In some cases the benefits of public services (e.g., environmental benefits \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 November 2014. \n2  The PRC\u2019s gross domestic product grew by 7.7% in 2013 and is expected to grow by 7.5% in 2014.

For such PPPs, governments may need to meet some project \ncosts through viability gap finance or availability payments. In some cases, achieving bankability \nrequires government to share some project risk via a guarantee or other form of financial \nsupport.  Consistent  with  the  experience  of  other  countries,  the  September  2014  notice \nacknowledges the potential need for government financial support for PPPs. But the notice does \nnot explain how this can be delivered. \n \n5.  Government specialized funds and guarantee schemes are used in many countries to \nprovide tailored support for PPPs which cannot be met through annual budget allocations. For \nexample, viability gap funds are used in Asia (e.g., in India and Pakistan) to provide an initial \ncapital contribution from the government. India Infrastructure Finance Limited and Indonesia \nInfrastructure Finance, provide loans to private partners to PPPs to facilitate the participation of \nprivate finance. Further, fiscal support on a project-by-project basis can delay project approvals \nand create uncertainty among potential private partners. Government agencies typically lack the \ncommercial  experience  and  specialized  skills  required  to  engage  effectively  in  PPPs  and \nspecialized  funds  and  guarantee  schemes  (the  latter  typically  provided  through  financial \nintermediaries) allows governments to access such specialized skills.  \n \n6.  ADB support for PPPs in the PRC follows the country partnership strategy and ADB\u2019s \nPPP operational plan.7 Under the country partnership strategy, ADB aims to strengthen the \nenabling environment for private sector development by financing infrastructure, supporting \npolicy  and  regulatory  reforms,  and  improving  access  to  finance.  ADB  experience  in  other \ndeveloping member countries provides a foundation that the PRC can draw upon. 8 With regard \nto pillars 1 and 2 of ADB\u2019s PPP operational plan, ADB\u2019s recent sovereign assistance in the PRC \nhas focused on supporting advocacy and capacity development9 and preparation of a national \nPPP law, PPP procedures, and guidance on PPP agreements.10 Good progress has been made \nand there has been a strong pickup in project activities at the local government level following \nadoption of decisions. This has led to demand for ADB sovereign support to transition to project \ndevelopment and project financing; pillars 3 and 4 of ADB\u2019s PPP operational plan.11 \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2012.

ADB has supported the development of different approaches \nto providing government financial support for PPPs (e.g., in India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet \nNam). Reviews of this support highlight the need to address the underlying structural constraints to private sector \nparticipation, and to strengthen systems used to prepare PPP projects, to ensure a good pipeline of projects. \nReviews also emphasize the need for workable designs, and to ensure that sufficient budget funds are available for \neffective implementation. \n8  For example, Independent Evaluation Department. 2009.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be an improved operational framework for the government to provide \nfinancial support to PPPs. Performance will be measured by the use of funds for providing \nfinancial support to PPPs (by the end of 2018).12 The outcome will be the consideration by \ndecision-makers of new tools for government to provide financial support to PPPs. Performance \nwill be measured by the presentation to MOF or local finance bureaus of a proposal for a fund to \nprovide financial support to PPPs (by the end of 2016). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will provide five outputs that will be delivered sequentially. It will build on the \nexperience of other countries to help the PRC prepare for the launch of a fund for providing \ngovernment financial support to PPPs. Proposals developed under the TA will be suitable for \napplication for the central or local governments. MOF\u2019s Public\u2013Private Partnership Centre, \nwhich was established in July 2014 under the China Clean Development Mechanism Fund \n(CCDMF), will lead the TA activities. \n \n9.  Output  1:  Assessment  of  the  international  experience  with  funds  providing \ngovernment financial support to PPPs. This will cover the relevant international experience, \nincluding viability gap funds and publicly supported infrastructure funds that provide quasi-\nequity, loans, and guarantees.13 The assessment will evaluate performance and identify lessons \nrelevant for the PRC. The output will focus on recent developments to identify new approaches \ntriggered by the global economic and financial crisis. Close attention will be paid to the (i) United \nKingdom\u2019s support for government guarantees and equity participation under the new approach \nto PPPs, the Private Finance 2; (ii) evolution of financial products offered by India Infrastructure \nFinance  Company;  and  (iii)  experience  of  Indonesia  Infrastructure  Finance,  Europe\u2019s  Joint \nEuropean Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas Program, the Building Canada \nFund, and other infrastructure and viability gap funds operating in South Asia. Facilities that \nhave an indirect role for government, such as India\u2019s infrastructure debt funds, will also be \nconsidered. If first-hand exposure to actual operations proves to be essential, a modest study \ntour will be undertaken to highly relevant countries. \n \n10.  Output 2: Options analysis of funds for providing government financial support to \nPPPs. The output will draw on the experience of other countries and an analysis of local \nconditions to formulate initial proposals tailored to the needs of the PRC. The options analysis \nwill identify the types of projects, sectors, or regions that are likely to require government \ncontributions (if any), verify that government intervention via a PPP fund is necessary to ensure \nsupply  of  the  proposed  financial  product(s),  and  identify  the  likely  demand  and  how  the \nproposed financial product(s) could best be provided. If a need for a PPP fund(s) to deliver \ngovernment contributions is established, the output will prepare concept notes for the most \nfeasible options for central and local governments for inclusion in an options paper. The options \npaper will be subject to peer review through a workshop(s) supported by the TA. The output will \ndraw on consultations with relevant government agencies, regulators, academics, and leading \nPRC  financial  institutions  and  other  key  stakeholders,  who  will  continue  to  be  consulted \nthroughout the TA. \n                                                \n12 Fund is used in a broad sense and includes guarantee schemes and programs providing financial support. \n13 The TA will avoid any duplication of existing funds and will not cover funds designed to attract private investors for \ncommercial investments in PPP, such as private equity funds. \n ", "  4\n \n11.  MOF\u2019s PPP Centre will agree on the options to be explored and define the required \ndetail of the concept notes. The option analysis will help the PPP Centre quickly appraise the \nrelevance of various approaches to the PRC, identify key issues and lessons that should \nreceive close attention, and subsequently guide design work to be undertaken by the TA \nconsultants. The options analysis will reconfirm the likely demand for a PPP fund and interest of \nthe central and/or local governments before proceeding to output 3. \n \n12.  Output 3: Design and operating procedures of a fund for providing government \nfinancial support to PPPs. Matters to be addressed by the design will include rationale, \nobjectives, legal and organizational structure, statement of financial products, outline of terms \nand  conditions,  governance  arrangements,  and  reporting  and  performance  assessment \narrangements,  which  will  be  consistent  with  other  audit  and  performance-measuring \narrangement for projects delivered in a conventional manner. The operating procedures will \ninclude application and processing procedures, and an accompanying staff manual. The design \nwill ensure compatibility with policy announcements and operating guidance provided by MOF \nand other government agencies. \n \n13.  The design and operating procedures will make use of successful examples. This will \noffer benefits in terms of quality and minimize the cost of preparation. Accordingly, the TA will \ndraw on the design and operating procedures developed by other countries, with an emphasis \non those developed in Asia with ADB support, as well as relevant initiatives in the PRC such as \nthe CCDMF. Consideration will be given to the needs of a range of potential investors and \ninternational financial institutions, notably with respect to social and environmental safeguards, \nand the potential need to integrate a project development facility. The design will identify the \nimplications of implementation through either an existing platform, such as the CCDMF, or a \nnew platform that would need to be established by a local government. The required detail of \nthe design will be specified at the commencement of output 3 taking into account the likely \nneeds of potential fund owners and the remaining TA resources. Additional design work is \nanticipated following the TA, particularly from a legal perspective, for potential fund owners. \n \n14.  Output 4: Comparison of a PPP fund with direct budget support to PPPs. This will \nexplore the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed PPP fund with the funding of \nfinancial  support  directly  from  the  budget  of  the  central  or  local  government.  Substantial \nfinancial support and a range of financial products are likely to be required by the PRC\u2019s \nexpanding PPP program; government financial support is expected to need both approaches. \nOutput 4 will inform the decision by the central and local governments of when one approach \nshould be chosen over the other. Key considerations are expected to be the setup costs, legal \nfeasibility, capacity constraints within government, demand, impacts on project bankability, and \nattractiveness of PPP to potential private partners and investors. \n \n15.  Output 5: Widely accessible publication on PPP funds. At least one publication will \nbe produced in English and Chinese targeted at senior decision-makers. This may be part of \nADB\u2019s  observations  and  suggestions  series.  The  publication  will  draw  on  outputs  1\u20134  to \ndisseminate the key TA findings and foster support for implementation. The TA will make \nmaximum use of earlier ADB TA and knowledge products, taking care to add value and avoid \nduplication, and coordinate with ongoing TA from ADB and other development partners. \n \n \n \n ", "5  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart staff, other services to \nconsultants, assistance in arranging meetings with  counterpart agencies, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from 12 December 2014 to 31 December 2016. MOF\u2019s PPP \nCentre will be the executing and implementing agency. As the TA will consider the needs of \nboth the central and local governments, a representative sample of local governments will be \nconsulted during implementation and participate in key workshops and other dialogue events. \nThe PPP Centre will coordinate with central and local government agencies, key financial \ninstitutions, and other stakeholders; and assign counterpart staff to assist the consultants. The \nPPP Centre will supervise the day-to-day work of the consultants and take overall responsibility \nfor workshops, other dialogue events, and the international study tour. A substantial input is \nexpected from ADB staff\u2014from the East Asia Department, other regional departments, and the \nPPP  office\u2014during TA implementation. In  particular,  ADB  staff  will  actively  engage  in  the \nconduct of the options analysis and the design of facilities for providing financial support, with an \nemphasis on sharing ADB experience elsewhere in Asia. \n \n18.  The  TA  will  engage  two  international  consultants\u2015a  financial  advisor  and  a  PPP \nadvisor\u2015for a total of 2.5 person-months, and six national consultants\u2015a team leader, a PPP \nadvisor, two financial advisors, a legal advisor, and a coordinator\u2015for a total of 15 person-\nmonths. Given the need for early commencement of implementation, and because no single \nfirm can be expected to provide well-qualified consultants for the full range of diverse and \nspecialized technical skills and country experience required for the TA, the consultants will be \nhired individually. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The detailed work \nplan of the consultant team will be updated and agreed upon by the PPP Centre and ADB as \nthe team is mobilized.14 \n \n19.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs, following the agreed timeline and budget. To support monitoring \nand evaluation, the team leader will submit an inception report, a midterm report, a draft final \nreport, and a final report to the government and ADB. TA review missions will provide the main \nmechanism to monitor and assess the TA. The publication(s) created by the TA will be provided \nto the government and ADB for dissemination. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Financing Public\u2013Private Partnerships, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 ADB will engage the international and national consultants, as well as resource persons, in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). An advance payment facility will be \nestablished to facilitate workshops and the study tour. All procurement will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n ", "Appendix 1  6 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n      Data Sources   \n  Performance Targets and  and Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and \nRisks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved  Funds for providing financial support  Government  Governments have the \noperational  to PPPs are in use by the end of  websites  fiscal capacity and \nframework for the  2018 (2013 baseline: zero)  World Bank  commitment to provide \ngovernment to  private  financial support \nprovide financial  participation in  The private sector and \nsupport to PPPs  infrastructure  financiers are open to \ndatabase  engagement in PPPs \nRisk \nStrengthening of the \nenabling environment \nand capacity is too slow \nOutcome      Assumption \nConsideration by  A proposed fund for providing  Consultation  Agencies cooperate on \ndecision-makers of  financial support to PPPs presented  with MOF, the  PPPs \nnew tools for  to MOF or local finance bureaus by  PPP Centre, and  Risk \ngovernment to  the end of 2016  local finance  Competing policy \nprovide financial  (2013 baseline: zero)  bureaus  priorities displace PPP \nsupport to PPPs  Official websites \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
