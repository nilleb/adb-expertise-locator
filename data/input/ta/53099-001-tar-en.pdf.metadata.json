INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support Thailand\u2019s efforts to  \n(i) recover from the socio-economic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic; \n(ii) reduce poverty, income inequality, and vulnerability to climate change, and (iii) enhance \nresilience of highland communities and their ecosystems. To enhance post-COVID-19 recovery \nefforts and to promote dissemination and use of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) knowledge, the \nTA will build technical and institutional capacities to assess vulnerabilities, demonstrate CSA \npractices  and  digital  technologies  for  traceability  of  agri-food  products,  and  support  local \ngovernments to integrate climate change concerns in agricultural planning.1 It will help enhance \nfood security in Nan province, while reviving and benefiting from local wisdom on climate \nresilience, indigenous stress-tolerant crop varieties, and value addition. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  Thailand.2 It  is  fully  aligned  with  Thailand\u2019s  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives Strategy, 2017\u20132036; Organic Agriculture Strategy, 2017\u20132021; Food Security \nStrategic Framework, 2017\u20132021; Digital Agriculture Strategy, 2017\u20132021; and Climate Change \nin Agriculture Strategy, 2017\u20132021, in terms of (i) enhancing production of high-value food that \ncan meet safety and quality demands and standards of domestic consumers and external markets; \nand (ii) deploying technologies focusing on effective, sustainable, and environment-friendly use \nof agricultural resources.3 The TA is aligned with the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Hanoi \nAction Plan, 2018\u20132022 and the strategy for promoting safe and environment-friendly agro-based \nvalue chains in the GMS.4 It is strongly aligned with six operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030: (i) promoting rural development and food security; (ii) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing  environmental  sustainability;  (iv)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality; \n(v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity; and (vi) fostering regional cooperation \nand  integration.5 The  TA  will  support  Thailand  in  its  efforts  to  achieve  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 1, SDG 2, and SDG 13, and Thailand\u2019s nationally \ndetermined contributions under the Paris agreement on climate change.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Agriculture remains crucial to Thailand\u2019s economy. More than 48% of the Thai \npopulation live in rural areas; over 30% are employed in agriculture; females constitute 41% of \nlabor in agriculture; about 40% farm households do not own land; and only 26% of agricultural \nhouseholds can access irrigation.7 In the highlands of northern Thailand, monocropping with \n \n1  Climate-smart agriculture is an approach to sustainably increase productivity, enhance climate resilience, reduce or \nremove greenhouse gases (mitigation), and enhance achievement of food security and development goals. \n2  ADB. 2019.

Bangkok. \n ", "2 \nmaize became a dominant economic activity after large tracts of forests were converted into \nfarmland. Unsustainable farming practices and natural resource degradation led to low crop \nproductivity,  unsafe  products,  and  unstable  incomes.  Household  debt  in  northern  Thailand \nprovinces, such as Nan, that border the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has risen by 22.4% \nbetween 2000 and 2015.8 Such high debt levels are likely to increase further due to COVID-19. \n \n4.  Soil and water-related challenges. Key issues facing highland agriculture include: \n(i) severe soil erosion caused by cultivation on sloping lands without proper soil conservation \nmeasures, (ii) high soil degradation from monoculture, (iii) high soil and water pollution because \nof inappropriate use of pesticides and fertilizers, (iv) severe water scarcity and sedimentation in \nwater bodies, and (v) lack of land ownership or user rights. Highland villages adversely impact \nwater quality in downhill areas because chemicals from agricultural runoff applied upstream enter \nthe  water  supply.  Limited  extension  support,  inappropriate  use  of  technologies,  and  weak \nincentives  for  behavioral  changes  that  support  soil  and  water  conservation  measures  are \nexacerbating these problems. \n \n5.  Climate change. Adverse impacts of climate change, manifested through intense and \nfrequent extreme events, such as droughts, floods, and rising temperatures, are already evident. \nAnnual economic losses from drought, for example, varied from $3.2 million to $89.8 million during \n2007\u20132016. A 2016 study on changes in climate extremes over northern Thailand showed that \ntemperature extremes rose significantly during 1960\u20132010.9 The study projected that the trend in \nrising temperature would increase significantly with an increase in summer days and tropical \nnights between 2020 and 2099. The study also projected a notable decline in the number of cool \ndays and nights, an increase in the number of warm days and nights, and an increase in annual \nrainfall of 9.65% compared with 1960\u20132010. \n \n6.  Regional and rural\u2013urban income disparities. Poverty in Thailand is concentrated in \nthe northern and northeast regions. The mean household income in the northern region, for \nexample, is less than half of that in the Greater Bangkok region.10 Poverty is expected to decline \nat a slower rate in rural areas than in urban areas. Economic growth is expected to become less \ninclusive, with the rural poor adversely affected unless agricultural productivity increases. Rural \nhouseholds are also aging rapidly as younger generations continue to migrate to urban areas.11 \nSupply  chain  disruptions  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  further  exacerbate  such  income \ndisparities. Job creation for, and upgrading agribusiness skills of, returning migrants from urban \nto highland areas due to COVID-19 will be critical to reduce income disparities.     \n \n7.  Limited private sector investment. Owing to the mountainous and remote terrains, high \ncost of logistics, and limited capacity of farmers to grow safe and quality agri-food products, \nprivate sector investments in highland agriculture in northern provinces have been limited. \nAdditional support to enhance the enabling environment for climate-friendly agribusinesses, \nidentify opportunities for value addition of agri-food products, and improve market connectivity \ncan promote private sector investments and support post-pandemic response and economic \nrecovery efforts. Likewise, increasing water and energy use efficiency and sustainable waste \nmanagement in post-harvest operations may help engage the private sector.  \n \n \n8  Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. 2015.

Lessons.  Local  governments,  in  cooperation  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives (MOAC) and civil society organizations implemented a few projects such as the \n\u201cone rai of an organic farm\u201d project, organic fertilizer formula project, Doi Tung development \nproject, Nan reforestation project, and \u201cNan Sandbox\u201d project to help sustain yields in highlands.12 \nThe TA will build on lessons from these projects and other ongoing projects on CSA in other GMS \ncountries.  Lessons  from  these  projects  call  for  (i)  improving  soil  and  water  conservation, \n(ii) promoting  crop  diversification  and  value  addition,  (iii)  enhancing  climate  resilience, \n(iv) engaging the private sector, and (v) strengthening capacities to integrate climate change in \nlocal development plans. These lessons are central to the post-pandemic recovery efforts as well. \n \n9.  Regional  cooperation,  integration,  and  knowledge  sharing.  In  2018,  the  GMS \ncountries envisioned the subregion as a leading supplier of safe and climate-friendly agri-food \nproducts (footnote 4). Among the GMS countries, Thailand is perhaps more suitable than others \nto address the complicated, multifaceted problems of highland agriculture because of its sound \nenabling environment, which includes good electricity coverage, 4G/5G internet connectivity, and \na thriving private sector. The lessons could be replicated in similar agroecosystems of other GMS \ncountries, thus offering several opportunities to promote regional cooperation and integration and \ncross-country knowledge sharing. For example, Nan province is part of the GMS northern heritage \ntrail, together with provinces in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. The TA \noffers new opportunities for developing more sustainable community-based ecotourism and better \nlinks between farmers and the private sector. It also offers opportunities to share knowledge on \nCSA practices, value addition opportunities, and alternate livelihood options with other GMS \ncountries. Such knowledge sharing can help enhance subregion\u2019s resilience to pandemics.  \n \n10.  Value addition. The TA will introduce innovative features such as (i) demonstrations on \nCSA and digital technologies for traceability of crop products; (ii) approaches for mainstreaming \nclimate change concerns in agricultural planning; (iii) trust-building between highland farmers and \nthe private sector through promoting organic certification, value addition, and alternative livelihood \noptions such as ecotourism, traditional homestays, medicinal plants, and honey collection and \nprocessing; and (iv) targeted capacity building and policy support to stakeholders along the value \nchain  to  enable  smallholders\u2019  transition  from  subsistence  to  commercial  agriculture.  By \nconducting targeted demonstrations, strengthening institutional and technical capacities, and \nproviding policy, advisory, and knowledge support for enhancing product value, safety, and quality, \nthe TA will help prepare a road map for a sovereign or nonsovereign pipeline of investments \nfocusing on CSA, agribusiness, and horticulture value chains. \n \n \n12 V.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: agricultural competitiveness in highlands \nimproved (footnote 3).13 The TA will have the following outcome: enabling environment for \nadoption of CSA in project areas enhanced.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Capacity to assess climate change vulnerability of highland agriculture \nimproved. This output will strengthen the capacity of local governments to assess vulnerability \nto,  and  impacts  of,  climate  change  in  priority  sectors,  using  the  latest methodologies  and \napproaches recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.15 Key activities \nwill (i) determine factors contributing to climate change vulnerability based on consultations with \nall relevant stakeholders, including ethnic communities;16 (ii) analyze existing baseline data and \nidentify capacity needs and gaps on vulnerability in different agriculture subsectors; (iii) strengthen \nthe capacity of local government staff to collect data and assess climate change vulnerability; \n(iv) assess climate change vulnerability and impacts under current and future climate scenarios; \nand (v) prepare a guidance manual on assessing climate change vulnerability in highlands.17 \n \n13.  Output 2: Gender-responsive, climate-smart agriculture practices prioritized and \ndemonstrated.18 This output will (i) prepare an inventory of gender and COVID-19-responsive \nCSA practices for highlands and conduct a multi-criteria assessment with stakeholders including \nfemale and male farmers, the private sector, and government staff to prioritize CSA practices;  \n(ii) conduct cost\u2013benefit analysis of at least three priority CSA practices; (iii) demonstrate at least \ntwo CSA practices in the target area (Bua Yai sub-district of Na Noi district in Nan province); \n(iv) build the capacity of stakeholders on CSA and prepare a road map for an inclusive climate-\nfriendly agribusiness investment project for Nan province in collaboration with the private sector; \nand (v) prepare knowledge products on CSA demonstration process and the most appropriate \nCSA practices vital for post-pandemic economic recovery of highlands. The selection criteria for \nthe target area included (i) relatively high levels of poverty and ethnic communities, (ii) severe soil \nerosion and water pollution due to indiscriminate use of pesticides, (iii) poor market connectivity, \n \n13 Impact of the TA is aligned with four out of five strategies of Thailand\u2019s 20-year agriculture and cooperatives strategy \n(2017\u20132036): (i) strengthening capacity of farmers and farmers\u2019 institutions, (ii) enhancing production efficiency and \nvalue addition of products, (iii) promoting the utilization of innovative technologies, and (iv) balanced and sustainable \nmanagement of agricultural resources and the environment. \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the United Nations body with 195 member countries for the \nassessment of climate change, including the physical science of climate; impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability; and \nmitigation of climate change. It was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the \nWorld Meteorological Organization to provide the world with comprehensive scientific assessments on climate \n \nchange, its implications, and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options.\n16 Mountainous highland communities (Mien, Hmong, Thai L\u00fc, Mabri, Htin, and Khamu) in Na Noi district of Nan \nprovince will be the primary beneficiaries. The criteria to select target households include (i) communities allowed to \nlive and farm within the head watershed of mountainous (sloping) areas; (ii) farmers practicing slash-and-burn \nsubsistence farming with limited and unreliable cash income from other farming activities; (iii) farmers with strong \ninterest to learn and try innovations and are committed to fully cooperate and contribute some resources (e.g., labor, \ntime) for project implementation; and (iv) villagers who exhibit a positive attitude toward working together as a group, \nfollow the community rules that are established and agreed upon by the group members, and cooperate with local \ngovernments. \n17 This manual would reference the social, economic, and environmental aspects of highland climate vulnerability. \n18 Gender-responsive agricultural practices will acknowledge and respond to the different needs, experiences, and \nopportunities of men and women who are practicing agriculture in the project areas. \n ", "5 \n(iv) willingness of the local government and communities to test and replicate CSA practices, and \n(v) support from the provincial governor and MOAC. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Agricultural  product  quality,  value  addition,  and  market  linkages \nenhanced. This output will focus on enhancing competitiveness and resource efficiency of post-\nharvest operations in highland agriculture, using modern technologies. The output will (i) identify \npriority highland agri-food products for quality and safety improvement and value addition by the \nprivate  sector,  including  processing,  packaging,  and  branding;  (ii) build  capacity  of  local \ncommunities,  in  an  inclusive  manner,  on  grower  certification  schemes  (e.g.,  participatory \nguarantee system), organic farming, and good agricultural practices; (iii) train local communities \n(encouraging the equitable participation of female and male farmers) and the private sector on \nagri-food quality and safety improvement and value addition, while encouraging the equitable \nparticipation of female and male farmers; (iv) demonstrate the application of digital technologies \nfor traceability of agri-food products; and (v) develop knowledge products on grower certification \nschemes, quality and safety enhancement, and value addition. All these activities are critical in \nenhancing economic recovery efforts post COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n15.  Output 4: Capacity of local governments and communities to address climate \nchange strengthened. This output will (i) train staff of local governments on integrating climate \nchange concerns in agricultural and development plans at district and provincial levels; (ii) raise \nawareness among female and male farmers, youth, nongovernment organizations, and the \nprivate sector on agricultural adaptation and mitigation measures, and alternative livelihood \noptions (e.g., ecotourism, non-timber forest products such as medicinal plants, honey processing, \nand handicrafts) vital for post COVID-19 economic recovery; (iii) conduct field visits to promote \n\u201cfarmer-to-farmer\u201d learning from demonstration sites; (iv) prepare knowledge products on CSA \ndemonstrations and alternative livelihood options; and (v) organize an international workshop on \nCSA to disseminate the TA findings. Farmers from other highland provinces, such as Chiang Rai \nand Chiang Mai, will visit demonstration sites. Local government staff and village heads will attend \nrelevant CSA events of the GMS and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to help \ndisseminate lessons and knowledge from the TA. The TA will target mid-career local government \nstaff and policy makers for training activities, so that capacity built through the TA is retained for \nlong term, thereby ensuring institutional sustainability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.2 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The following are ineligible expenditures under the \n2018 JFPR policy guidelines and are not included in the TA\u2019s cost estimates and financing plan \n(Appendix  2):  (i)  purchase  of  vehicles,  (ii)  salaries  for  civil  servants,  (iii)  foreign  travel, \n(iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering design, (vi) civil works and other \nrelated expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and \nProhibited Investment Activities List.
