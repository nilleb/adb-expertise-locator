Key Development Issues to be addressed:  \n \nKey Development Issues: Access to quality education is widely acknowledged as the primary driver of broad-\nbased socio-economic development. Unfortunately, as reflected by the key basic education indicators, Pakistan\u201fs \nscorecard in the education sector has been very poor. Literacy rates - an indicator of a minimal level of education \nattainment - stands at 57%, staying stagnant over the last 5 years and \nfalling well short of the 88% UNDP\u201fs Millennium Development Goals target \nfor 2015. Net Enrolment at the primary level is showing similar trend, with \na gain of only 5% during the last 4 years. At the current pace, full primary \nenrolment may not be achieved before 2050. The primary completion rate, \na measure of education quality, stood at 54.6% in 2008/09, for public \ninstitutions. The number has dropped sharply since 2005/06 and has gone \nflat for the last 3 years. This indicator signifies poor quality of the public \nschool system, which lacks teachers, has substandard quality of teaching \nand inadequate infrastructure. Even in comparison to similar economies of \nthe  region,  Pakistan\u201fs  performance  in  education  is  unsatisfactory; \nPakistan\u201fs  EDI  (Education  for  All  Development  Index)  is  0.640  in \ncomparison to 0.797 for India and 0.759 for Bangladesh2.  \n \nThe technical education and vocational training (TEVT) segment performance is equally disappointing. In 2008/09, \nenrolment stood at 264,712 trainees, spread over 3,159 TEVT Institutes, i.e. an increase of only 11% the 3 year \nperiod.  Despite  the  presence  of  training  colleges  and  centers,  the  existing  TEVT  curriculum  and  quality  of \ninstruction has not kept pace with the present day job market. The requirements increasingly demand a much \nhigher competency level, development of soft skills, and use of modern technology, etc. to attain relevant livelihood \nand employable skills.  \n \nAnalysis of the basic and technical education segments points towards low access, poor  quality  and weak \nrelevance. Over the last 10 years, multiple initiatives have been launched to address these issues. An estimated \nUS$3 billion of development assistance has been given for long-term programs, including education sector reforms, \nteacher education, assessment upgradation and education data management. In parallel, Rs 1,215 Billion (or \nroughly $17 billion) have been invested in education by Government of Pakistan, from 2005/06 to 2009/10. Despite \nthese investments and interventions, the vital education indicators show no significant improvement. \n \nThe Way Forward: The present situation calls for change in focus and strategy driven by technology and \ninnovation. Conventional approach of simple physical school expansion to increase enrollment has to evolve into \nmore innovative modes of increasing access to education. The improvement in Information and Communication \nTechnology (ICT) in Pakistan in recent years provides an unprecedented opportunity for Pakistan to significantly \nimprove access to quality education by connecting students through ICT to the educational resources.  \n \nEnabling Environment in Place: A lot of ingredients (in the IT and Education sectors) are already in place to \ndeploy ICT for improved quality of education. \n \n(i)  Policy: Pakistan\u201fs first National IT Policy was launched in 2000, with a revision due in 2012. The revised \npolicy  draft  talks  about  \u201ceEducation\u201d,  covering  ICT-centric  capacity  building,  IT  infrastructure  (including \ncomputer and internet footprint), content development, outreach programs; necessary enablers to ensure ICT \nintegration into education. The ICT infrastructure component is covered more elaborately under the Telecom \nAct of 1994. This Act has been followed up by sub-sectoral policies, i.e. broadband policy and the mobile \npolicy, defining the long-term goals in these areas.  \n \n(ii)  Infrastructure: Pakistan\u201fs ICT infrastructure has experienced pervasive expansion and upgrade in the last \ndecade in terms of mobile, internet and PC penetration. As of June 2011, Pakistan\u201fs teledensity stands at 69%, \nwith almost all of it attributed to 109 million mobile subscribers3. The country has 1.39 million broadband \n                                                \n2 EDI is a composite index based on primary enrollment, adult literacy, gender and survival rate indicators. \n \n3 www.pta.gov.pk ", "    3 \nconnections and an internet user base of around 20 million. Pakistan\u201fs ICT Development Index Score \u2013 a \nmeasure of country\u201fs progress towards becoming an information society - improved from 1.56 to 1.83, from \n2008 to 2010, posting 17% change as compared to the 14.4% average for the developing countries4.  \n \nInternet access is now available in over 3,000 cities and towns of Pakistan including semi-urban and rural areas. \nBroadband internet footprint is expanding fast, especially through wireless connectivity. There are 7 wireless \nbroadband service providers in Pakistan, with a subscriber base of approx 700,000 using WiMAX and CDMA \ntechnologies5. Mobile internet using EDGE  is being offered by  all five mobile operators in Pakistan.  GPRS \n(supporting low speed internet) and SMS services are available to 100% of mobile subscribers and used frequently. \nPC penetration in Pakistan is 13% of Households in 2010, up from 9.8% in 20086. It is showing a strong growth, \nespecially in comparison to similar economies and the developing countries (India\u201fs PC penetration is 6.1% HH in \n2010). The other major point of access is the Netcafe. Pakistan has a well grounded community based internet \naccess through netcafes and telecenters, thereby connecting a large number of internet users who can\u201ft afford a \nPC at home. \n \n(iii) Technology: Pakistan market has a strong and vibrant PC and mobile vendor community. The country is \nhome to roughly 110 million mobile phones. From brand names to compatibles, all type of hardware is available \nin Pakistan. It also has a strong maintenance and support capability resource pool present in urban and semi-\nurban areas. The country also has a significant used hardware market, which helps bridge the affordability gap \nfor majority of the users. Smartphones and tablets are also making a notable entry into the market. The \ndeclining price curve at the global level is helping the spread of these handheld devices in developing \ncountries. \n \n(iv) Content  Development:  Pakistan  has  a  rich  and  talented  pool  of  IT  and  software  companies  with \nspecialization  in  content  development.  Game  and  interactive  applications  for  mobile  devices  is  a  hot \ndevelopment niche in Pakistan. There are several ongoing initiatives for creating education centric digital and \ninteractive content; these include creation of animated and game based learning content, educational videos, \nlocalization of international content, conversion of existing content into electronic form, etc.  \n \n(v)  Institutional Support: Teacher education curriculum has undergone significant transformation in recent \nyears. One notable development is the induction of ICT track in the new curriculum for the Bachelors and \nAssociate Degrees in Education, for elementary/secondary school teachers. Emphasis is on computer literacy \nfor teachers and using ICT as an instructional aid in the classroom. As part of the Government of Punjab IT \nLabs  program,  teachers  were  trained  in  IT  skills  before  placement  in  schools.  Public  sector  training \norganizations like Directorate of Staff Development have now included basic IT trainings as part of in-service \nteacher training program.  \n \n(vi) Financing: GoP sponsored Universal Service Fund (USF) under its various broadband initiatives has \nalready signed contracts worth $195 Million for provision of telecom and broadband services in under-served \nareas of the country7. National ICT Research and Development Fund is another source of funding available for \nproliferation of ICT enabled services in the country. Its vision is to transform Pakistan\u201fs economy into a \nknowledge based economy by promoting efficient, sustainable and effective ICT initiatives through synergistic \ndevelopment of industrial and academic resources. One of their focus areas for R&D is to leverage ICT to \ndevelop scalable and sustainable solutions to deliver international quality education. In the development sector \nDFID is about to launch Development Innovation Fund for education sector in Pakistan. USAID\u201fs \u201eImproving the \nQuality of Reading Activity\u201f is a 5-year, $30 Million program which aims to improve the quality of reading and \nnumeracy skills in 500,000 students in Sindh. \n \nRelevant Regional Initiatives confirm High Potential: There are many regional experiences that reinforce the \npositive impact of ICT for education, in terms of deeper outreach, unlimited access and transformation of teaching-\nlearning process. Teachers Resource Centers in Maldives have been equipped with virtual learning environment for \n                                                \n4  www.itu.int/wsis \n5  www.pta.gov.pk \n6  www.pta.gov.pk \n7  www.usf.org.pk \n ", "4   \nonline teacher education across various islands. Multi-purpose Community Telecenters have also been established \nfor providing ICT-enabled services. In India, Educomp is transforming the way teachers teach and students learn in \nschools. Under the Edureach program, Educomp has partnered with fourteen (14) State Governments covering \nover 14,500 government schools and benefiting 7.9 million students. Indian government has also launched a \nsatellite EDUSAT exclusively to serve the needs of interactive satellite-based distance education system in the \ncountry. The pan African e-Network project, now in its 2nd phase, is assisting African countries in capacity building \nby way of imparting quality education to 10,000 students in Africa over a 5-year period in various disciplines from \nsome of the best Indian Universities/Educational Institutions. In Bangladesh, Village Communications and Internet \nProject by Grameen Communications aims to provide rural communities with ICT enabled educational facilities. RI-\nSol in collaboration with Intel has established 47 Internet Learning Centers in 10 districts of Bangladesh providing \nonline communication tools to be used by teachers and students. Open University of Sri Lanka, and Indira Gandhi \nNational Open University India are also actively providing open distance learning services. Reviewing these \nregional initiatives and evidence of increasingly widespread use of ICTs in education initiatives around the world, \nendorses the case for the effective integration of ICT for education in Pakistan. \n  \n8.  TA Description:  \n \nGiven the key  development issues  highlighted above, there is  an  urgency to meet the country\u201fs  education \nobligations. The most plausible approach, promising the deepest and quickest impact is to integrate ICT assisted \nadvanced learning technologies into the present Education system. ICT for Education\u201fs potential to deliver has \nbeen validated within the region. The purpose of this TA is to explore and design strategies for effective and \nbroad-based integration of ICT in basic education and TVET, based on latest trends and experiences. \n \nThis TA can be best implemented by partnering with an organization that is already pursuing similar goals and \ncurrently poised at early stages of planning large scale deployment. This approach would ensure expedited project \ninitiation followed up with an effective implementation. TeleTaleem (T2) one of the very few companies - with a \nproven track record -active in the ICT education sector has been identified as the Implementing Partner for this TA. \n \nTeleTaleem is an eLearning service that connects learners and teachers to quality learning sources. T2 provides \nan ICT platform to enable the users to access learning resources, unrestricted by geographical, social, institutional \nand time boundaries. It is a cross cutting initiative able to serve all educational segments \u2013 from primary to tertiary \nand from teacher education to technical and vocational education. Using T2, a teacher or a master trainer is able to \nreach out to the learner through ICT without travelling to remote and inaccessible areas, saving time and money. In \naddition, the learner has unlimited access to a rich repository of learning and training materials of T2. T2 is \nexpected to be self sustaining from the revenues generated for the fees charged for its services.  \n \nT2 platform comprises three sub-systems; Learning Management System, Content Management System and \nVirtual Classroom. The Learning Management System comprises of a course creation & management module, \nintegrated scheduler management, assignment submission tracking and assessment, forums and groups. The \nVirtual Classroom includes access to live class with full audio/video interactivity, unlimited number of white boards, \nonline chat, screen and document sharing with annotation/markup features. The Content Management System \ncomes with recording and playback options, repository for storing learning collateral and storage of content \ndeveloped over time. All lectures that are delivered through T2 are recorded and stored in the repository and can \nbe accessed later through a variety of access devices both in/outside the class. The supported content types \ninclude plain textual content in the form of books, powerpoint slides, animated interactive content, game based \nlearning  content,  lesson  plans,  training  videos,  activity  based  projects,  etc.  Development  of  an  integrated \nassessment module is also in its initial stages. \n \nT2 development, starting in mid-2009, is a collaborative effort based on the inputs of leading specialists and \npractitioners in Education and Technology. Since inception, T2 has engaged with a broad and comprehensive mix \nof stake holders and user groups. Starting 2010, T2 service has undergone an extended validation cycle with a \nwide variety of user cases. T2 has connected with a broad category of institutions, educators and education \nauthorities, ranging from schools to teacher education to training institutions, from public, private and non-profit \nsectors.  \n \nT2 service is backed up by a technology driven business group, Comcept, with exposure in ICT products, services ", "    5 \ndesign and delivery. Setup in 1992, Comcept has been involved in various technology related ventures \u2013 It set up \nWorldCall, a telecom services provider, which was eventually sold to OmanTel; it also started Burraq Telecom (later \nWi-Tribe) \u2013 one of Pakistan\u201fs largest long distance international (LDI), wireless local loop (WLL) and Wi-Max \noperator \u2013 later acquired by Qatar Telecom. Comcept recently  deployed the TeleSehat8 platform at Shifa \u2013 \nPakistan\u201fs leading hospital  - to deliver  healthcare  services in Northern Pakistan through remote tele-clinics. \n*CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED* \n \nSpecifically, T2 will deliver (once fully operational): \n \nA. Basic Education: Pervasive and unlimited access to quality teaching and learning environment, focused on \nneed-based teacher education and continuous development. For a teacher, T2 will provide web-based portal \nto access quality training material, master trainers and mentor teachers on a 24x7 basis devoid of any \ngeographic dependency. The access availability will be in close proximity of workplace, via on-premises \nschool computer labs or off-premises T2 Centers, T2 mobile units, and even handheld devices (i.e. mobile \nphones). T2 will also have self assessment modules to ensure that the teacher training has achieved the \ndesired results. The same platform later will be used by teachers to teach students in remote locations where \nthere are general (and subject specific) teacher shortages. \n \nB. Technical Education and Vocational Training: Market-driven-employable skills will be delivered through \nquality instructors based on upgraded curriculum. T2 in partnership with international training institutes (like \nCity & Guild UK), will offer accredited training programs based on current market requirements. These \ntrainings would lead to globally recognized certifications thereby improving candidates\u201f chances of placement. \nT2 will also offer linkages to web-based jobsites and career counseling organizations and consultants. In \naddition to providing access to the right training opportunity, T2 will connect the junior trainers to master \ntrainers located anywhere in Pakistan or abroad. \n \nC. Tutorial Education: Introduce quality subject-specific-tutoring with broad-based access. T2 will provide short-\nterm, non-degree based tutorial services, connecting quality tutors with prospective learners from anywhere to \nanywhere. The idea is to give access to demand and need based quality tutoring services through T2-enabled \nfranchised learning centers. The learner can also avail the T2 service from his/her home as well using internet. \nT2 will also host collaborative assignments, peer-to-peer interactions and access to relevant supplementary \nresources. \n \nTA Funds Usage: TeleTaleem is at an early inception stage with major development work to be undertaken. The \nTA funds would be utilized to conduct situation and gap analysis, market analysis, business planning, preparation \nof a feasibility report, and a detailed program design & implementation template. Key activities proposed to be \nundertaken through TA include: \n \n  Research & Situation Analysis \nAfter the initial project startup activities, a detailed research and situation analysis will be conducted with the \nhelp of a consulting firm. Research and analysis of this phase will have two key components. Firstly, an \nunderstanding and analysis of all stakeholders that may either benefit or be affected by the availability of \nadvanced learning solutions. Secondly the initial stakeholder analysis will be followed by an in-depth gap \nanalysis that will focus on the identified target population whose needs will be further examined through \nworkshops, meeting with leading experts and focused group discussions. A nationwide survey will also be \nconducted to validate and probe gaps identified. Independent consultants will prepare a best practices and \ntechnology roadmap report after conducting studies on latest trends in innovative/blended learning pedagogy, \nICT4E advances, standards, ICT infrastructure and web services. \n \n  System Design \nBased on the inputs of the previous phase, detailed design will be carried out to ensure that technological, \neducational, learning, institutional, gender and content related considerations are met. Based on the design \nrequirements, service framework and system architecture will be developed. \n                                                \n8 Sehat is the Urdu word for health \n ", "6   \n \n  Content Provisioning \nExisting learning content and repositories shall be identified and arrangements will be put in place so as to \nleverage the already available content using ICT. Learning Technologists & Content Specialists will work \ntogether to outline the interface requirements of the selected repositories for integration in the overall service \nframework. \n \n  Business Planning \nResearch and situation analysis  will also lead to  a comprehensive business planning  exercise covering \ncustomer analysis, competitor analysis, market analysis, market sizing and segmentation, feasibility, etc. The \nfeasibility study will include pricing analysis and preparation of a financial model for the T2\u201fs program and \nservices. \n \n  Partner Network Development \nThis  will  be  an  on-going  activity  aimed  at  developing  the  partner  network  with  relevant  subject \nspecialists/master trainers/institutions. Partnerships will also be cultivated for provisioning content and ICT \ninfrastructure and technology. Potential partners will be identified, shortlisted and selected. \n \n  Program validation \nThe designed program will be validated in the pilot phase. Multiple small scale pilots may be conducted which \nwill include setup of the infrastructure and service in target areas and connecting learners and teachers as per \nthe designed teaching-learning scenarios..  \n \n  Program design review \nProgram design review workshops will be held to assess the pilots and the program will be tweaked based on \nthe feedback received. \n \n  TA final report \nThe project will complete with the preparation of the TA final report which will contain a validated program \ndesign and an implementation template. \n \na.  Link to Country Partnership Strategy/Regional Cooperation Strategy: \nThe proposed assistance to the Project is consistent with: a) Strategy 2020, which emphasizes support for the \neducation sector (especially access to education for all) and private sector development, and b) the Pakistan \nCPS with its emphasis on economic infrastructure and private sector development. The project also remains \nsynergic with the Education 2020: A Sector Operations Plan, which identifies ICT for Education as a key priority \narea. \n \nb.  Impact  \nThe impact of the TA will be improved access to higher quality learning  resources for students and \nteachers using ICT. \n \nc.

Assumptions and risks  \n \nAssumptions \n1. Effective participation by stakeholders (students, learners, teachers, institutions) \n2. Access to quality education remains a constraint in various parts of the country  \n \n       Risks \n1.  Slow adoption of advanced learning technologies by teachers and learners \n2.  Resistance to change in adopting new methods and technologies from potential users at the grassroots \nlevel \n3.  Security conditions in the country restrict travel, movement and field activities of consultant teams \n \n10. Implementation Arrangements \n \na.  Proposed executing/implementing agency (EA/IA)   \n \nADB will be the executing agency of the TA.  PSIF1 or PRM (as deemed appropriate from an implementation \nstandpoint) will be responsible for consultant recruitment, oversight, monitoring and evaluation. This will be carried \nout in close coordination with T2\u201fs CEO as client\u201fs focal point. The consultants engaged under the TA will deliver \nthe key outputs of the TA. The duration of specific individual consultants\u201f assignments will vary in line with their \nrequired output levels. The 18 month TA is expected to be implemented in three phases: a) Situation/Gap Analysis \n(approx. 8 months), technical and financial feasibility (approx. 6 months), program design and validation (approx. 7 \nmonths). There will be some overlapping between the three phases. The procurement and deployment of the \nconsultants is provided in the following implementation schedule.  \n \nImplementation Schedule\nM1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9 M10 M11 M12 M13 M14 M15 M16 M17 M18\nINDIVIDUAL CONSULTANTS\nHiring of all Independent Consultants\nEducation Policy Advisor\nTeam Lead - Education\nLearning Technologies Specialist \nTeam Lead - Systems (1)\nMedia & Communication Specialist\nPACKAGE 1: RESEARCH, DESIGN & MANAGEMENT\nProcurement Of Services\nImplementation\nPACKAGE 2: SYSTEMS\nProcurement Of Services\nImplementation\nPACKAGE 3: LEARNING\nProcurement Of Services\nImplementation \nPACKAGE 4: CONTENT\nProcurement Of Services\nImplementation \nPACKAGE 5: BUSINESS PLANNING & MARKETING\nProcurement Of Services\nImplementation \nIntermittent Full Time Consultants' Recrutiment  \n \nb.

ADB inputs \n \n ", "8   \nADB fund will provide (i) consultancy support, (ii) support for training, workshops, seminars and conferences, (iii) \nsurveys, and (iv) other related costs. See Appendix 2 for outline terms of references for consultants, firms and \nindividuals, who will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement (April 2010 and as \namended from time to time) and ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2010 and as amended from time \nto time). ADB\u201fs support will include 186.7 person months of international (5.7) and national consultants\u201f (181.0) \ninput.  This  includes  150.5  person  months  of  consulting  firms\u201f  input  and  36.2  person  months  of  individual \nconsultants.  \n \nConsulting firm assignments are divided into five packages covering areas of Design, Management and Research, \nSystems  Development,  Learning  and  Content  Development,  and  Business  Planning  and  Marketing.  Design, \nmanagement and research package requires extensive field work covering the provinces of Punjab, Khyber-\nPakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan; given the security situation, language requirements, local context, and presence \nof local consulting firms with sufficient international capacity - or local subsidiary of an international firms (such as  \nGallup, Development Alternatives International, Crown Agents, Coffey International etc.) - this package would be \nrestricted to domestic as deemed appropriate. Systems, Learning and Content Development packages would be \nalso open to international firms, however to be price competitive these firms would be expected to work through \nnational consultants (associate firms/individuals) as sufficient in-country capacity is available in education and ICT \nin public and private sectors in Pakistan.  It is considered prudent to engage national experts who not only have the \nexperience of working and understanding the local situation, infrastructure and industry but will also identify the \ngaps and design a system.  \n \nIn considering national consultants, experts who have experience of working with international organizations will be \npreferred. Recruiting national experts also ensures sustained capacities in scaling-up of the program in medium to \nlong term.   \n \nThe implementation of PPTA will be done by dividing the various discrete work streams into distinct packages to be \nconducted by consulting firms and individual consultants.  The individual consultants apart from their own distinct \nresponsibility will also in some cases be responsible for supervision of the consulting firms. Please see Appendix 2 \nfor outline of the TORs.  The consultants will be hired using Qualification and Cost Based Selection Method. In the \nevent request for expression of interest does not attract participation of suitable international firms or international \nconsultants, ADB will proceed with selection of national firms and national consultants.    Advance procurement \nactions will be undertaken before the TA effectivity as deemed appropriate. Given that the content, duration of \nservices, and consultants\u201f outputs are clearly defined, the Lump Sum contracting method is proposed. During the \npreparation of RFPs and detail terms of reference, the payments to the consultants will be quantified and linked to \nthe outputs.

To \nachieve outcomes under the Education component, Government of Pakistan has committed to, inter alia, increased financing \nfor the sector, enhancing governance for greater accountability of education service providers to the community, and \nimproving  utilization  of  resources  by  educational  institutions  including  IT  leveraging.  The  recently  concluded  country \npartnership  strategy  consultations  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  (GoP)  and  ADB  highlighted  the  demand  for \ninfrastructure development in the sector and emphasized improvement in quality of service delivery. ADB consultations with \nother potential donors to GoP also highlighted the need for improving fiscal and financial management to create greater fiscal \nspace for enhanced spending by provincial governments in the social sectors including education.  \n \nThe Project will be instrumental in improving the performance of learners by increasing enrolment and completion rates (basic \neducation and tutoring segment) and making them more marketable/employable (for technical education and vocational \ntraining segment). \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);   Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nTA focus is on increasing accessibility to quality basic education (including primary education, which is one of the key MDG \nGoals [Goal 2]) \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? N/A \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? None \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)?   \nProject design may be enhanced by adding pro-poor features such as providing scholarship or subsidies to qualified poor \ngirls/women students and other individuals who are part of marginalized groups. It is expected, however, that T2 services will \nallow for access to better quality education and improved employment chances after course or module completion.    \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject?   \nPrimary beneficiaries are students, teachers, trainees and instructors. The TA is intended to explore pragmatic strategies that \nwill help connect these beneficiaries, inclusively and equitably, located in geographically and socially disadvantaged areas. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project?   \nPotential needs of the beneficiaries are easy and cost-efficient access to content, resources and specialists, in both basic and \ntechnical education, from anywhere and anytime. These needs are more pronounced for potential beneficiaries located in \nsemi-urban  and  remote  locations  and  for  girls/women,  who  are  socially  constrained  in  terms  of  travel  from  their \nhomes/villages. Capacity building for teachers and education tutors  that will be adopting and using ICT for educational \npurposes, readiness of students/learners in using the technology as an alternative mode in gaining knowledge, readiness in \nthe part of service provider to design the technology which best suits the needs of the learners and their environment. \n   \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem?   \n ", "Appendix 4  23 \nThe potential constraints are identified as: \n(a) Lack of physical infrastructure in terms of school buildings, technical training centers and essential facilities. \n(b) Weak and outdated curriculum, teaching material and teaching aids. \n(c) Lack of well qualified, adequately trained teachers and instructors \n(d) Institutional readiness and resistance in adapting new methods and technologies \n(e) Slow adoption of information communication technology by teachers and learners \u2013 affecting quality of teaching on \nthe side of the teachers/tutors and absorption rate (students/learners) \n(f) Insufficient fund availability to meet existing requirements based on conventional remedial actions \n(g)  Affordability of accessing education via eLearning \n \nThe TA will explore and define an ICT enabled solution strategy that will transcend the afore-mentioned infrastructure, social \nand fiscal constraints to reach out to all students, teachers, trainees and trainers with appropriate educational and training \ninterventions. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \nInitial potential stakeholders include teachers, teacher educators, principals, school management committee members (from \nthe community), education managers and education policy makers. Specifically, these are \n  Comcept (Pvt.) Limited \u2013 the lead in T2 technology development for the proposed Project and other service providers \n  T2 Teachers \u2013 master trainers, teacher mentors, teachers that will be trained (primary education teachers, teachers \ninvolved in technical education and vocational training (informal education tutors) \n  Potential T2 students/subscribers \u2013 individuals who will avail of eLearning education \n  T2 eLearning partners: (a) participating schools for primary and secondary eLearning activities, (b) for vocational and \ntechnical training \u2013 local and International Training Institutes,  (c) institutions involved in short-term, non degree \nbased tutorial services (for long distance education) \n  Government  institutions  (  Ministry  of  Education,  Ministry  of  Information  Technology,  Provincial  Governments) \nwhereas the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development, accreditation and some financing of \nresearch) \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)?   \nThe TA\u201fs success is tied-in to effective consultative process with relevant stakeholders and user group. The TA will cover a \nmulti-stage series of workshops to do gap analysis/need assessment at provincial & district level, design review and program \ndissemination. The TA also involves meeting with leading experts and specialists and focused group discussions at district \nlevel.  \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?   Yes          No    Please explain. \nC&P plan will be one of the outcomes under component 1 of consulting services.  \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program?   \nIn case of basic education the gender bias affects both girl students and female teachers. Social issues and lack of girls \nelementary schools (nearby) lead to low girl enrolment beyond primary. Similarly, female teachers avail limited in-service \ntrainings because out-station travel is severely restricted due to social and cultural constraints. Similar trends exist on the \nTechnical Education front as well. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u201fs empowerment by \nimproving women\u201fs access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?        Yes         No    Please explain. \nThe project will identify strategies to leverage ICT integration and advanced learning platforms to provide alternative means of \nteaching-learning practices well suited to girl students and female teachers, in close proximity to their home/workplace. \nAdditionally, female teachers will have access to best training opportunities and online teacher educators without the need to \ntravel outside their homes/villages.  \nThis draft is for consultation purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the views of ADB\u201fs \n \nManagement, Board of Directors, or the Government of [country]. Comments may be submitted to [e-\n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?      \nmail address] by [deadline].  \n          Yes          No    Please explain.   \nThe Project has no adverse potential impact to widen the gap. In general, access to education is a problem both for males and \nfemales in Pakistan. \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nIII.
