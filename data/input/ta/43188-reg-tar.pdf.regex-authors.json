INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported agriculture and natural resources \nresearch (ANRR) by the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research and other \ninternational agriculture research centers since the adoption of the ADB's ANRR policy paper1 in \n1995. To date, 13 regional technical assistance (RETA) grants have been provided. A special \nevaluation study of the ANRR policy2 noted the high economic returns on investments of the \nANRR RETA grants and recommended that ADB continue to support ANRR.  \n2.  The Thirteenth Agriculture and Natural Resources Research at International Agricultural \nResearch Centers (ANRR RETA 13) was a response to the 2008 global food crisis.3 ANRR \nRETA 13 is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020 as it addresses food security as an underlying \nelement of the inclusive growth strategy.4 One of its components was designed to increase rice \nproduction by reducing pest and disease outbreaks and by supporting appropriate postharvest \ntechnologies.  The  adoption  and  adaptation  of  appropriate  pre-  and  postharvest  rice \ntechnologies and practices will take at least 5 years before having a visible impact on the rice \nmarket. Acknowledging the length of this gestation period for technology development and \ndissemination, the RETA included a provision that \"ADB may provide additional subsequent \nfunding support \u2026 subject to its initial success and the availability of funds.\" \n3.   The  proposed  research  and  development  TA5 will  continue  and  build  on  the  work \ninitiated in ANRR RETA 13, specifically on the adoption and adaptation of pre- and postharvest \ntechnologies and practices.   \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Food prices rose sharply in 2007 and 2008 and the rise in the export price of rice more \nthan tripled between November 2007 and March 2008. Rice stocks dropped to below the \ninternationally accepted threshold of 20% of global production. These developments, coupled \nwith the world financial recession, adversely affected Asia\u2019s poor, who spend as much as \n30%\u221240% of their income on rice. In Asia, more than 480 million people (nearly 70% of its poor) \nare rice producers and consumers of rice as a staple. Ensuring stable prices and enhanced \nproductivity and profitability of rice are thus integral to reducing poverty.   \n5.  The immediate challenge for 2010\u20132015 is how to increase the global rice supply to \nmeet rising demand and replenish existing rice stocks. Increasing rice production is a major \nchallenge as the effects of climate change in Asia (including the potential for plant hopper \noutbreaks induced by rising temperatures) intensify.6 Intensive cropping systems are likely to be \nparticularly affected as plant hopper outbreaks are also associated with overuse of fertilizers \nand  pesticides.  In  2009,  such  outbreaks  increased  significantly,  with  citings  reported  from \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1995.  Policy on Agriculture and Natural Resources.

Approved in September 2008, the ANRR RETA 13 has two components: \nthe first dealt with reducing preventable pre- and postharvest losses in Asia with IRRI as its implementing agency ; \nand the second looked at agricultural policies that can ensure both short- and long-term food security with the \nInternational Food Policy Research Institute as its implementing agency. The TA's closing date is October 2010. \n4  ADB. 2008.Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n5 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 26 October 2009.  \n6 ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n  ", "2   \nBangladesh,  Cambodia,  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  India,  Republic  of  Korea, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  These outbreaks may have implications for \nrice production and food security, since India, Thailand, and Viet Nam are major global suppliers \nof rice. \n6.  Rice supplies can be increased in the short term by closing the yield gaps of 1 to 2 tons \nper hectare that can be found in most irrigated rice farm fields in Asia.7 This gap can be closed \nthrough measures to prevent pre- and postharvest losses, such as ecologically based crop \nmanagement practices that prevent pests (such as plant hoppers) during the pre-harvest stage. \nThese practices involve increasing the diversity of the predators and parasitoids that regulate \npests and reducing the use of fertilizers and insecticides by more than 50%.8  \n7.  Rice supply can also be increased by reducing grain losses at the postharvest stage. \nAbout 5%\u20136% of rice is lost due to poor cutting, handling, threshing, and cleaning. Another 5%\u2013\n21% is lost because of inadequate drying, storage, milling, and processing facilities. The total \nestimated losses are 10%\u201337% of all rice grown. If rice farmers can reduce their postharvest \nlosses, their incomes will increase as the quantity and quality of their marketed rice improve. \nRice consumers will also benefit as the rice they consume improves in quality and prices drop.  \n8.  As a response to the global food crisis in 2008, the International Rice Research Institute \n(IRRI)  developed  a  5-year  pre-  and  postharvest  program  with  the  aim  of  increasing  rice \navailability by 5% from 2008 levels by 2015 in selected Asian countries.9 ADB supported the \nprogram's start-up costs through ANRR RETA 13, and may provide additional support if the \nprogram is successful and funds are available.  \n9.  The  semiannual  progress  report  from  IRRI  on  the  status  of  its  first  year  pre-  and \npostharvest activities under ANRR RETA 13 documented the initial achievements. Some 92 \nnational  agriculture  research  and  extension  systems  (NARES)  conducting  ecological, \ntoxicological and sociological research are involved in the collection and analysis of baseline \ndata that will be used to develop new seeds that are resistant to pests and virus outbreaks. \nStandardized research methods in ecology, toxicology and sociology have been established \nand  the  protocols  are  available  online  in  the  blog  developed  under  ANRR  RETA  13 \n(http://Ricehoppers.net). The blog, which has attracted more than 14,000 visitors from all over \nthe world, provides a platform for sharing information and analysis. A database for effective \nmonitoring and impact assessments has also been set up. Initial results show that some farmers \nin the PRC and Viet Nam whose lands are adjacent to the pilot fields have tried out these \necological engineering crop management practices.   \n10.  IRRI, in partnership with farmers, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the private \nsector, has developed a suite of technology prototypes that are designed to reduce the losses \nand  improve  the  quantity  of  grains.  In  2009,  needs  assessments  and  participatory  impact \npathway  analyses  were  conducted  in  participating  developing  member  countries  (DMCs), \ninvolving various stakeholders. National learning alliances, which will help to build partnerships \nwith many stakeholders, have already been set up. The development of business models and \ntechnology-specific extension approaches has already started in Cambodia and Viet Nam. \nSome private local manufacturers, in partnership with farmers' groups in these countries, have \n                                                 \n7 IRRI. 2008.

The proposed technical assistance will continue the activities planned for and initiated in \nthe pre- and postharvest component of the ongoing ANRR RETA 13. It will provide support to \nensure that better pest management practices and postharvest technologies and management \noptions are pilot tested, validated, and tailored to particular socioeconomic and agronomic \nconditions. It will ensure that many stakeholders (and rural women in particular) are engaged \nbefore pilots are scaled up.  \n12.  As in ANRR RETA 13, the design of the proposed technical assistance incorporates the \nlessons learned from previous ADB-funded RETA projects on ANRR, including the need to  \n(i) strengthen the capacity of national agriculture research systems; (ii) improve links among \nresearchers, practitioners, and policy makers to improve the dissemination of research findings; \nand  (iii)  strengthen  ADB's  capacity  to  coordinate,  supervise,  monitor,  and  evaluate  ANRR \nactivities. The proposed TA will also increase the participation of women in pre- and postharvest \nactivities because of their critical role in implementing and disseminating agriculture innovations \nand practices.   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be increased rice availability in the project sites of Cambodia, the PRC, \nthe  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  Appendix  1  contains  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework. The expected outcome will be an increase in rice farmers' capacity to reduce pre-\nharvest and postharvest losses in the project sites of participating DMCs.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  For the subproject on reducing pre-harvest losses, the key outputs will be: (i) a new field \nresistance screening method and germplasm with durable field resistance to plant hoppers and \nviruses  developed  and  disseminated;  (ii)  strategies  to  manage  virus  spreads  in  rice  fields \ndeveloped  and  implemented  in  project  sites;  (iii)  ecologically  based  management  of  pest \noutbreaks implemented  on  a  pilot  basis;  (iv)  country-specific  strategies  to  manage  viruses \nimplemented; and (v) research and extension capacities of NARES partners improved. To \nachieve these outputs, the key activities will be: disseminating genetic stock information and \nplant hopper screening procedures to all NARES partners; conducting analysis of gender roles \nin the use of ecological engineering methods for non-rice habitats; implementing ecologically \nbased management of pest outbreaks in project sites; training NARES scientists and other \ntechnical staff on ecological engineering, and biodiversity and ecosystems services analysis;  \nand engaging in policy dialogues in support of gender-sensitive ecological based management.  \n15.  For  the  subproject  on  reducing  postharvest  losses,  the  key  outputs  will  be:  \n(i) appropriate postharvest technologies and management options developed, locally produced, \nand distributed; (ii) agricultural extension and/or advisory services for postharvest technology \nand  practices  suitable  for  local  environments  prepared;  (iii)  business  models  for  improved \npostharvest technologies developed and verified on a pilot basis; and (iv) a national postharvest \nnetwork involving many stakeholders strengthened. The key activities will include: carrying out \nadaptive research on postharvest technologies; piloting and developing business models on \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  on  postharvest  extension  services;  building  on  modalities  for \n ", "4   \nsustainable  learning  alliances  (including  networks  of  women)  on  postharvest  technologies; \ntraining of men and women farmer intermediaries on extension systems; promoting market \nawareness; and enhancing technology transfer.  \n16.  A participatory process involving many stakeholders will be employed in the pre- and \npostharvest subprojects. The process will engage the NARES, local and national governments, \nthe private sector, farmers' groups, and NGOs in facilitating the adoption and adaptation of \ntechnologies and practices, identifying capacity building and policy gaps, participating in training \nand policy dialogue, and monitoring and providing feedback on project activities and outputs.   \n17.  The key assumptions are that (i) local and national governments in DMCs will support \nthe scaling up of pre- and post harvest technologies and practices, (ii) trained NARES staff will \nnot shift careers, and (iii) IRRI is able to mobilize additional funds for the remaining activities of \nits  pre-  and  postharvest  program.  The  risks  include:  (i)  local  elites  capture  postharvest \ntechnologies, (ii) farmers are unable to adopt the technologies, and (iii) regulatory measures \ndiscourage the adoption of the technologies. The TA will address these concerns through policy \nreforms  and  communication  mechanisms  that  (i)  advocate  for  increased  and  sustained \ngovernment budgets for agriculture research; (ii) remove restrictive measures that hamper the \nuse of pre- and postharvest technologies and practices; and (iii) disseminate these technologies \nand practices widely. Before the end of the project, IRRI and ADB will assess and explore \noptions for funding the pre- and postharvest program, including a supplementary TA.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.0 million equivalent, and will be financed on a grant basis \nfrom ADB's TA Special Fund (TASF IV and TASF-other sources). Detailed cost estimates and a \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nIV.  IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n19.  The TA is expected to be implemented from January 2010 to December 2011. ADB \nthrough  its  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (Agriculture,  Rural \nDevelopment, and Food Security Unit) will be the executing agency. The unit will oversee the \nimplementation of the TA. It will regularly monitor the TA progress in achieving the desired \nimpact, outcome, outputs, and activities in a timely manner. The funding and implementation of \nthe TA are subject to receipt of no-objection letters from the participating DMCs:  Cambodia, the \nPRC, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n20.  The TA will be implemented by IRRI, which will be engaged through single-source \nselection  in  accordance  with  the  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Single-source  selection  is  justified  because  IRRI  is  uniquely \nqualified to develop pre- and postharvest measures that can help reduce the rice yield gap in \nrice-growing  Asian  economies.  IRRI  is  recognized  globally  as  the  leading  center  for  rice \nresearch and extension. It has about 50 years of experience in cutting-edge research on rice-\nrelated knowledge and technology, has extensive regional rice-based research infrastructure, \nhas a critical mass of scientists and can easily access appropriate experts with multidisciplinary \nknowledge on key rice-based agro-ecosystems, and has global and regional research networks \nwith established links to the NARES.  \n21.  IRRI will implement the TA under the supervision of ADB. It will be responsible for (i)  the \ntimely delivery of quality outputs of the experts; (ii) the conduct of training, seminars and \n ", "  5\nconferences; (iii) undertaking the surveys and regular monitoring and evaluation of the TA's \nactivities in achieving the TA's outputs, outcome, and impact; and (iv) for the reports and other \ncommunication related TA activities. It will hold an inception workshop within 2 months of the \nTA's approval to confirm the activities and milestones for each intended output of the pre- and \npostharvest subprojects. The midterm and final workshops will be held within 12 months and 21 \nmonths of TA approval, respectively. IRRI will submit the following reports to ADB: (i) an \ninception report; (ii) two semiannual progress reports, (iii) a midterm progress report; (iv) a final \ncompletion  report;  (v)  semiannual  financial  statements;  and  (vi)  audited  annual  financial \nstatements.    \n22.  IRRI will provide about 59 person-months of international experts and 74 person-months \nof national experts in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time).. The expert needs are: an insect ecologist and team leader for the \npre-harvest  subproject,  a  postharvest  systems  expert  and  team  leader  for  the postharvest \nsubproject, a virologist, an international and a national insect toxicologist, a taxonomist, a \ntraining specialist, a local postharvest systems expert, an international and a national impact \npathways and innovations systems expert, an international and a national communications \nscientist, a policy expert, a value chain and business model specialist, and a production and \nagro-industrial supply chain expert. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n23.  IRRI will procure laboratory equipment for the pre-harvest activities and goods and \nrelated services for the construction of postharvest technology prototypes in accordance with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). At the end of the project, \nequipment procured and constructed under the TA will be turned over to the NARES partners.  \n24.  Disbursement under the TA will be undertaken in accordance with ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook 10 \n25.  IRRI will disseminate the outputs and feedback on the progress made in achieving the \nproject outcome and impact through websites, the media, periodic meetings with concerned \nstakeholders, rice-related networks, and publications.  \nV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n26.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis for Addressing the Pre- and \nPostharvest Challenges of the Rice Supply Chain.  \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2008.
