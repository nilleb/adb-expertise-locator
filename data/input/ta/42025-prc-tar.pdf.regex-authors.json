During the 2007 Country Programming Midterm Review Mission, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  prepare  a  drought  management  strategy.1 In  July  2008,  a  \nfact-finding mission visited the PRC and reached an understanding with the Government on the \nTA\u2019s impact, outcome, output, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, \nand  the  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Droughts have seriously affected daily lives and socioeconomic activities in the PRC, \nparticularly in poorer areas and have caused about 48% of the country\u2019s total direct economic \nlosses. From 1950 to 2006, droughts triggered water shortages to about 29 million people and \nreduced annual grain production by about 15 million tons. About 61 million people experienced \ndrinking water shortages during a severe drought between 2000\u20132001, which affected more \nthan 620 cities and towns in 18 provinces. Moreover, particularly in large cities such as Dalian, \nTianjin, Weihai, and Yantai, water supplies were under dangerously low levels. The 2-year \ndrought also caused a reduction of about 115 million tons of grains, creating concerns about \nfood security in the PRC. In 2006, the country again suffered a severe drought, which resulted \nin water shortages to about 36 million people and a reduction of about 42 million tons of grains. \nThe worst-hit area was in the southwest\u2014one of the poorest regions that includes Chongqing \nMunicipality and Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces\u2014where about 20 million people \n(9.9% of the region\u2019s population) experienced serious water shortages. \n \n3.  Generally, droughts have affected the PRC\u2019s environment. Many northern wetlands and \nlakes\u2014such  as  Baiyangdian  Lake  in  Hebei  Province,  Nansi  Lake  in  Shandong  Province, \nXianghai Wetland in Jilin Province, and Zhalong Wetland in Heilongjiang Province\u2014suffer from \nwater shortages or dry out during prolonged droughts. In the north, people tend to use more \ngroundwater during droughts, resulting in widespread groundwater and land subsidence in both \nurban  and  rural  areas.  About  6,670  square  kilometers  of  arable  land  and  23,500  square \nkilometers of pastureland have been desertified due to consistent water shortages, and many \nfarmers have become \u201cecological refugees\u201d, and are forced to migrate long distances in search \nof arable land. During drought years, dust storms also occur more frequently. \n \n4.  Since  the  1950s,  drought  management  policies  were  mostly  prepared  to  mitigate \ndrought  impact  on  agriculture.  However,  currently,  there  is  no  law  to  regulate  drought \nmanagement in the PRC. In recent years, national, provincial, and local governments have \nestablished drought management plans and guidelines, such as a national flood control and \ndrought relief emergency plan, provincial-level drought relief guidelines and emergency plans, \nand city-level drought preparedness plans. In addition, many other rules or regulations have \nbeen established for drought relief management, such as methods to assess losses caused by \ndroughts and benefits brought by drought relief actions, subsidies for drought management \nactions, drought reporting systems, and drought severity indices. The major shortcomings of \nthese existing plans, guidelines, rules, and regulations are (i) drought-relief actions are generally \npassive in response to crises caused by droughts; (ii) no long-term strategic plans for adaptation \nto drought; (iii) drought-relief policies are government-centered, and  participation of the private \nsector and nongovernment organizations are not given due attention; (iv) responsibilities of \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 29 October 2008. \n ", "2   \ndifferent agencies are not well defined, and interagency coordination is not effective; (v) lack of \ninformation gathering and sharing mechanisms for early drought warning; (vi) subsidies for \ndrought  management  are  usually  minimal  in  comparison  with  losses  actually  caused  by \ndroughts;  (vii)  lack  of  commercial  insurance  to  share  drought  risk  through  domestic  and \ninternational insurance markets; and (viii) the current policies lack adequate attention to the \nprotection of the ecosystems and environment.  \n \n5.  Although the PRC has made remarkable achievements in coping with droughts using \nstructural measures such as the construction of water conservation structures and irrigation \nsystems, this approach could produce negative impacts on water cycles, ecosystems, and the \nenvironment. Generally, as drought impacts have become more severe, the traditional approach \nof  using  structural  measures  is  no  longer  practical  nor  economically  feasible.  Structural \nmeasures  cannot  meet  all  requirements  for  drought  management,  and  nonstructural \nmeasures\u2014such as drought monitoring, forecasting and warning, drought insurance, and water \nsaving technologies\u2014have yet to be well developed. \n \n6.  The PRC has yet to initiate systematic and comprehensive drought management studies. \nSuch studies in the United States have found that droughts cannot be avoided, but their impacts \ncan be alleviated through good management. As a result, the United States is shifting from \ncrisis management to risk management to minimize drought impacts by establishing drought \npreparedness  plans,  policies  and  regulations  for  mitigation,  and  advance  forecasting.  \nInternational lessons learned and experiences will be useful for creating a long-term national \ndrought management strategy in the PRC.  \n \n7.  ADB has been increasingly involved in water resources management in the PRC, such \nas the Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project,2 the Hunan Flood Management Sector \nProject,3 the  Flood  Management  Strategy  Study,4 and  in  Implementing  the  National  Flood \nManagement  Strategy.5 The  proposed  TA  will  support  the  Government  in  establishing  the \nnational drought management strategy and is in line with the priorities of ADB\u2019s water policy6 in \npromoting a national focus on water sector reform and fostering integrated management of \nwater resources. It is also in line with the PRC Country Partnership Strategy (2008\u20132010)7 in \npromoting  resource  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability  and  in  improving  natural \nresources and ecosystem management, and supports the Government\u2019s objectives in the water \nsector. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA is improved and sustainable drought management in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). The outcome of the TA is the adoption of an integrated drought \nmanagement strategy throughout the PRC.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, to be conducted over a \nperiod of 4 months, consultants will (i) review geography, meteorology, and hydrology in the \nPRC; (ii) review historical drought situations including social, economic, and environmental  \nimpacts, exploring key problems and changing drought patterns; (iii) review existing strategies, \npolicies, and regulations for drought management in the PRC; (iv) review existing strategies, \npolicies, and regulations for flood and water resources management, and investigate their links \nto drought management in the PRC; (v) review institutional structures at the national, river basin \ncommission, provincial, and local government levels, as well as decision-making processes in \nall levels of government for routine, emergency, and proactive drought management; (vi) review \nstructural and nonstructural drought management measures that have been conducted in the \nPRC  to  date;  (vii)  select  several  drought-prone  provinces  with  different  climatic  and \nsocioeconomic characteristics as case study areas, and conduct detailed case studies; (viii) \ninvestigate international technologies and practices for drought management; (ix) conduct an \ninternational study tour for Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) staff to study international  \ntechnologies and practices for drought management; and (x) hold an international workshop \ninviting internationally renowned experts to discuss drought management concepts; drought \nmonitoring and forecasting; drought assessment and risk analysis; and drought management \nstrategies, policies, regulations, measures, and technologies. \n \n10.  In the second phase, to be conducted over a period of 8 months, consultants will (i) \nconduct pilot tests of successful international drought management practices\u2014identified during \nthe first phase\u2014in the selected provinces, and assess the feasibility of adopting these practices \nin the PRC; (ii) identify key issues for future drought management in the PRC; explore ways to \nlessen serious drought impacts; identify options for drought management; and formulate a \nnational drought management strategy framework and action plan to provide a general basis for \ndesigning and guiding integrated provincial-level drought management programs, taking into \nconsideration  diverse  natural  and  socioeconomic  conditions,  balanced  structural  and \nnonstructural  measures,  and  links  to  flood  and  water  resources  management;  (iii)  hold  a \nworkshop for wider dissemination of study findings and awareness building; and (iv) publish a \nhandbook on the drought management framework and action plan for decision makers and local \ngovernment officials, as well as a policy brief for wider dissemination of study findings and policy \ndialogue with higher-level decision makers.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $820,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance \n$400,000 equivalent from its TA  funding program. The  Multi-Donor Trust Fund8 under the  \nWater Financing Partnership Facility will provide cofinancing of $230,000 equivalent on a grant \nbasis, to be administered by ADB. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund will be used for specific activities \nshown  in  Appendix  2.  The  Government  will  provide  $190,000  equivalent  to  cover  in-kind \n                                                 \n8 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n ", "4   \ncounterpart  costs  and  services,  including  the  provision  of  necessary  data,  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, site transport, training and conferences, and other administrative support. \nDetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  MWR will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MWR is responsible for the overall \nadministration  of  water  resources throughout the  PRC  and  has shown  strong capacity  for \nexecuting externally-assisted projects (footnotes 2, 3, 4, and 5). A steering committee will be \nestablished  under  MWR  to  provide  overall  guidance  for  TA  implementation.  The  steering \ncommittee members will be senior representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of \nFinance, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, MWR, National Development and \nReform Commission, and other ministries and provincial governments as necessary. A technical \nassistance management office (TMO) will be established in MWR to act as the secretariat of the \nsteering  committee,  administer  day-to-day  project  activities,  and  coordinate  with  ADB  and \nrelevant provinces. MWR will assign an experienced full-time MWR staff member to serve as \nthe director of the TMO and counterpart staff to work closely with the TA consultants. MWR will \nalso provide office space, access to communications and copiers, and logistical support for TA \nimplementation. The TMO director will manage and liquidate funds provided by ADB and the \nGovernment for training, seminars, and conferences. \n \n13.  A panel of technical experts will be established as required to review the work of the TA \nconsultants and the TMO. The panel members will be experts from relevant sectors. The panel \nwill collaborate with the TMO in organizing at least three 1-day panel meetings during TA \nimplementation at inception, midterm, and final phases. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, starting in June 2009 and ending in June \n2010. Substantial time will be devoted to survey, fieldwork, and workshops. It is expected that \ntwo workshops at the central level and a workshop in each selected province will be undertaken. \nThe consultants will submit an inception report within the first 4 weeks of the start of the TA and \nan interim report 4 months after the TA starts. A draft final report will be submitted 10 months \nafter TA commencement, and a final report at TA conclusion. The inception, interim, and draft \nfinal reports will be subject to review by the Government and ADB. All reports should be written \nin English and translated into Mandarin. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n15.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants engaged through a firm. A total of 11 \nperson-months of international consulting services and 24 person-months of national consulting \nservices will be required. The consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsulting firm will be selected by (i) inviting simplified technical proposals; and (ii) using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost weighting ratio of 80:20. The office \nequipment provided under the TA for the consultants will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will be handed over to MWR \nupon  TA  completion.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  undertaken  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.9 Advance payment procedures will be adopted \nto facilitate timely implementation of activities related to seminars and conferences. ADB funds \nfor training, seminars, and conferences will be transferred to an existing MWR bank account \nand managed and liquidated by the TMO director. ADB will undertake intensive review and \nsupervision by fielding missions at critical stages of TA implementation\u2014particularly at inception, \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008.
