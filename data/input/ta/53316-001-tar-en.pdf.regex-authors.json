INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  International \nPublic Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) work program for 2019\u20132021 to improve \npublic financial reporting and management capacities in developing member countries of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), with a positive impact on governance, accountability, and \ntransparency.1 \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its developmental agenda on good \ngovernance, anticorruption, and enhanced public financial management (PFM).2 This TA has \nbeen included in the ADB Management-approved annual work program of the Controller\u2019s \nDepartment. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  IPSASB  is  a  standards-setting  body  that  operates  under  the  International \nFederation of Accountants (IFAC).3 The principal activity of the IPSASB is to develop financial \nreporting standards for public sector entities, with the aim of moving toward accrual-based \nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) for both developed and developing \ncountries. The IPSASB plays a critical role in enhancing the quality and transparency of public \nsector financial reporting and promoting the adoption of the IPSAS. \n \n4.  A key challenge for public sector financial reporting is that many governments still use \ncash-based  accounting  and,  therefore,  provide  minimal  disclosures  compared  with  what \nstakeholders  generally  expect  from  the  private  sector.4 Cash-based  financial  reporting  has \nlimitations as it does not provide accurate and complete information on all financial transactions, \nassets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. The IPSASB encourages public sector \nentities  to  adopt  accrual-based  accounting,  which  reflects  the  full  economic  reality  of \ntransactions and provides a comprehensive picture of the financial performance and position of \npublic entities.5 This addresses a fundamental aspect of strengthening PFM and enhancing \naccountability and decision-making in the public sector. The IPSASB also believes that a strong \noutreach  program  is  important  to  raise  awareness  of the  IPSAS  and  the  benefits  of their \nadoption. It highlights the importance of capacity building in the public sector as a prerequisite \nfor the effective implementation of accrual-based IPSAS. \n \n5.  The pace and scale of IPSAS adoption and implementation have increased significantly \nin recent years. This is a trend that is likely to continue, with the number of governments around \nthe world adopting accrual-based accounting estimated to increase from 25% in 2018 to 65% by \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 September 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  Established in 1973, IFAC is the global organization for the accountancy profession dedicated to serving the   \npublic  interest  by  strengthening  the  profession  and  contributing  to  the  development  of  strong  international \neconomies. \n4  Cash-based accounting is a method of accounting where transactions are recorded when cash receipts and cash \npayments occur. Thus, revenue is recorded when cash is received from customers, and expenses are recorded \nwhen cash is paid to suppliers and employees. \n5  Under accrual-based accounting, transactions and economic events are recorded when they occur, regardless of \nwhen cash receipts and payments happen. \n ", "2 \nthe end of 2023.6 Therefore, standards and guidance increasingly will need to meet the practical \nrequirements of a significantly expanding user group. \n \n6.  ADB has been providing TA for the IPSASB\u2019s work program since 1997 (in six phases), \nwith extensive activities carried out in all the prior phases.7 As of 31 December 2018, there had \nbeen 42 accrual IPSAS and three recommended practice guidelines issued for the use of public \nsector  entities.  During  phase  six,  10  IPSAS  or  amendments  to  IPSAS  and  other  major \npublications  were  approved  and  issued.  To  date,  the  IPSASB  has  dedicated  significant \nresources to outreach activities; it intends to continue these efforts. \n \n7.  The IPSASB recently conducted a comprehensive review of its broad strategic direction, \nincluding a public consultation on its strategy and work program during 2019\u20132023. Based on \nthe feedback obtained through the public consultation and many outreach events, the IPSASB \nhas confirmed that it should continue to focus its work on developing and maintaining the IPSAS \nand other high-quality financial reporting guidance for the public sector. In addition, the IPSASB \nwill  continue  to  raise  awareness  of  the  IPSAS  and  the  benefits  of  accrual  adoption  in \nstrengthening PFM. \n \n8.  Recognizing that the development of a high-quality financial reporting standard is a long-\nterm process, various development partners continue to support the IPSASB, including IFAC, \nwhich remains the largest fund provider. With the progress made in the first six phases, the \nIPSASB is now seeking support through further TA for 2019\u20132021. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  public  sector  financial  reporting  and \nmanagement globally strengthened through increasing adoption of accrual-based IPSAS. The \nTA will have the following outcome: decision-making and accountability of public sector entities \nimproved and global fiscal stability and sustainability enhanced.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n10.  Output  1:  High-quality  financial  reporting  guidance  for  the  public  sector \ndeveloped and maintained. Application of the IPSAS enhances the quality and transparency \nof public sector financial reporting by providing better information for PFM. It has the potential to \nimprove decision-making in the public sector, to help governments to be more accountable to \ntheir  citizens,  and  to  enhance  global  fiscal  stability  and  sustainability.  As  the  international \nstandards-setter for the public sector, the IPSASB\u2019s role is to provide governments and other \n \n6  IFAC and The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. 2018.

By developing accrual-based IPSAS, the IPSASB will be assisting \ngovernments in providing a more comprehensive view of financial position, thereby enhancing \nthe credibility and transparency of their financial reporting, which plays an important role in \nimproving decision-making in the public sector. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Programs  to  raise  awareness  of  the  International  Public  Sector \nAccounting  Standards  and  the  benefits  of  accrual  adoption  in  strengthening  public \nfinancial management designed. The IPSASB plans to achieve this output in various ways, \nsuch  as  working  with  global  and  regional  bodies  to  raise  the  profile  of  the  IPSAS  with \ngovernment officials, financial regulators, and ratings agencies and markets\u2014all of which are \nkey advocates needed as consistent supporters of adopting, implementing, and monitoring \ncompliance with the IPSAS. The programs will focus on persuading governments to prepare \naccrual-based financial reports using the IPSAS and encouraging users of government financial \nreports to demand better information from governments\u2014information that would be available by \nreporting in accordance with the IPSAS. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the IPSASB work program for 2019\u20132021 is estimated at $7,698,000, of \nwhich $330,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. Other donors providing parallel \ncofinancing to IFAC on a grant basis totaling $1,125,000 are (i) the Government of Canada \n($460,000), (ii) the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada ($460,000), and (iii) the \nGovernment of New Zealand ($205,000). IFAC will provide the remaining funding requirement \nof $6,243,000. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will not engage consultants for this TA. For the previous six phases of the TA, the \nprocurement arrangements were such that all goods and services to be financed out of ADB \nfunds should be procured in accordance with the standard procedures of IFAC and acceptable \nto ADB (i.e., produced and supplied from ADB member countries). These arrangements have \nworked well in the last six phases of the TA, and the same arrangements will be implemented in \nthis seventh phase. IFAC will implement this TA through the IPSASB, which will ensure that the \nexpected outputs are disseminated to the public sector through the publication of new and \nrevised IPSAS and outreach activities to engage with stakeholders. \n \n14.  TA implementation will begin in December 2019 and is expected to be completed in \nDecember 2021. ADB funds will be released in three installments, each totaling $110,000. The \nfirst installment will be released upon receipt by ADB of the TA letter agreement countersigned \nby IFAC. The two subsequent installments will be released based on the submission of (i) a \nfinancial statement of accounts, showing the use of grant funds from various funding agencies; \n(ii) audited financial statements of IFAC, with supplementary information on IPSASB projects; \nand (iii) an annual progress report on the project activities supported by the TA. IFAC will \nmaintain separate records of ADB financing and provide the following to ADB within 6 months of \nthe fiscal year in which the funds are utilized: an annual progress report and audited financial \nstatements. \n \n15.

Governance \n16.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  staff \ninstructions on business processes for TA, as the TA involves the transfer of funds from ADB to \nIFAC, a not-for-profit association. The transfer of funds involves delegated use of a lump sum of \nthe TA resources by IFAC, which will administer, procure, and disburse funds for the TA \nactivities. The instrument used for the assessment of the TA project\u2019s executing agency was \nADB\u2019s Financial Management Assessment Questionnaire for Knowledge Partnerships, which \nhelps  assess  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  executing  agency,  funds  flow \narrangements, accounting policies and procedures, internal and/or external audits, reporting \nand  monitoring,  information  systems,  and  budgeting.  Para.  17  summarizes  the  financial \nmanagement  assessment  of  IFAC.  In  addition,  integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted.  No \nsignificant integrity risks were identified. \n \n17.  IFAC has no contribution in shares of stocks and has no private sector components in its \nownership structure. IFAC\u2019s legal status, annual audited reports, organizational structure, and \ngovernance are available on the IFAC website. IFAC has an accounting system that allows for \nthe proper recording of project financial transactions, and controls are in place concerning the \npreparation and approval of transactions, ensuring that all transactions are correctly made and \nadequately explained. Financial statements are prepared in accordance with the IPSAS and are \naudited by an independent external auditor, which is overseen by the audit committee of IFAC. \nIFAC uses Sage Intacct, a cloud-based software, for its accounting and reporting. IFAC has an \nannual budgeting and rolling forecast process that starts in April every year. The budget is \napproved by the IFAC board annually, and forecasts are presented to the board quarterly. There \nwere no significant issues noted from the financial management assessment. \n \n18.  The TA categorization is complex because of the information presented in para. 16. \nHowever, no major technical project risks have been identified, as the IPSASB is competent in \nthe subject area. ADB is one of the five donors that will finance the IPSASB budget to carry out \nthe work program of the seventh phase. IFAC remains the largest financier of the IPSASB, \nfunding about 80% of the total estimated costs. A cofinancing risk of donors failing to commit \ntheir funding is mitigated as the IPSASB, the largest contributor funding about 80% of the total \nestimated costs, has sound governance and internal controls in place as mentioned in para 17. \nThe  remaining  funding  of  20%  will  be  provided  by  four  other  donors  including  ADB,  and \ncofinancing risk for each donor is considered minimal.\u00a0\n \n ", "5 \n19.  ADB will maintain observer status in IPSASB meetings and membership in the IPSASB \nConsultative Advisory Group. ADB\u2019s Controller\u2019s Department will monitor and oversee the TA \nactivities, and provide, as needed, direct input to the work of the IPSASB by reviewing the \nconsultation papers and exposure drafts and ensuring that ADB member countries\u2019 comments \nare addressed before the final standards and guidelines are issued. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $330,000 on a grant basis for \nPublic Sector Accounting Standards (Seventh Phase), and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \n \nPublic sector financial reporting and management globally strengthened through increasing adoption of \naccrual-based IPSASa \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nDecision-making  a.
