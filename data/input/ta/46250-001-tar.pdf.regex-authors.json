INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strategy 2020 identifies infrastructure and environment as two of the five core areas of \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  operations;  three  of  the  five  drivers  of  change  are  good \ngovernance and capacity development, knowledge solutions, and partnerships.1 In line with \nStrategy 2020, in March 2013 ADB approved Environmental Operational Directions, 2013\u2013\n2020.2 Consistent with the directions, ADB seeks to continually improve the management of \nenvironmental issues including helping Asian cities improve institutional capacity for air quality \nmanagement (AQM).   \n2.  The technical assistance (TA), with its crosscutting infrastructure and environment focus, \nfits  well  with  ADB  policy.  The  TA  links  with  the  country  partnership  strategies  of  several \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) that identify worsening air pollution as a key challenge.3  \nThe regional cooperation and integration strategy supports ADB's overarching goal of poverty \nreduction through regional collective actions, and emphasizes ADB's active role as catalyst, \ncoordinator, and knowledge leader of regional cooperation and integration in Asia and the \nPacific.4 The strategy is anchored on four pillars; one is cooperation in regional public goods \n(RPGs), i.e., the promotion of RPGs through coordinated actions to supply RPGs, such as clean \nair, control of communicable diseases, and management of natural disasters. The TA addresses \nclean air and health. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5   \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Seven  out  of  10  cities  in  developing  Asian  countries  have  unhealthy  levels  of  air \npollution, given annual measures of particulate matter (not greater than 10 microns). Recent \nestimates from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease identify outdoor air pollution as a much more \nsignificant public health risk than previously known\u2014contributing to 2.1 million premature deaths \nannually in Asia. Of primary concern is exposure to particulate matter and nitrogen oxide from \nolder  diesel  engines.  Diesel  emissions  include  black  carbon,  which  contributes  to  global \nwarming. More than 50% of the Asia and Pacific population now lives in cities, where exposure \nto roadside air pollution is high. Over the next 30 years, another 1.1 billion people are expected \nto be living in cities. A systematic and integrated AQM approach is necessary to address the \ngrowing air pollution problems. Unfortunately, the status of AQM in Asian cities varies widely \nand cities have not developed quickly enough to respond to the changing urban landscape and \nevolving challenges in reducing air pollution. \n \n4.  Challenges of AQM in Asian cities include  \n(i)  the need for support in identifying and prioritizing effective AQM measures;  \n(ii)  poor reliability of air quality monitoring data for several cities because of lack of \ntechnical capacity and support to sustain air quality monitoring systems; and  \n(iii)  the need for TA and guidance in conducting emission inventories and source \napportionment, both important inputs to effective AQM.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact will be enhanced capacity of the beneficiary cities to manage urban air \npollution. The outcome will be increased application of knowledge and understanding of AQM \nby beneficiary city governments.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.   The TA is designed to address these issues and aims to promote evidence-based long-\nterm planning in AQM and selection of appropriate strategies for implementation through south\u2013\nsouth twinning. The DMCs in Asia are all at a similar stage of development and face similar \nchallenges in AQM. Effective AQM practices implemented by one country and/or city are likely \nto be relevant and applicable to others. The TA will assess the current status of AQM in 10 \nAsian cities with varying population size, and will set up south\u2013south twinning arrangements \namong three pairs of cities. The TA will identify up to four countries facing significant air quality \nchallenges  and  provide  a  platform  for  exchange  of  AQM  experience  and  knowledge.  The \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has initiated concerted efforts to develop a long-term AQM \nstrategy and a suitable policy framework for its implementation. It will participate in the TA along \nwith India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n \n7.   In January 2014, ADB and the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) signed \na memorandum of understanding on ADB support for the PRC government to improve the \nnational AQM framework.  Building on existing and past ADB support, the TA will review AQM \ninitiatives in the PRC and provide recommendations on a long-term strategy and improvements \nin key policy instruments for their effective implementation. This in-depth interaction with the \nPRC  will  be  helpful  for  effective  sharing  of  the  PRC\u2019s  learning  in  AQM  with  other  DMCs \nparticipating in south\u2013south twinning.  \n \n8.  The TA will provide opportunities to promote sharing of experience and knowledge in \nAQM among up to four countries in the region through workshops and working sessions. The \nparticipating countries and beneficiary cities will be encouraged to develop and disseminate \npolicy and project interventions to improve air quality. The TA will make use of the clean air \nscorecard tool (CAST) to assess the status of AQM and recommend actions for improvement. \n \n9.  The TA has six outputs. \n  \n10.  Output 1: Selection criteria for participating cities and countries developed and \napplied. CAST will be the primary tool used to develop and apply the criteria for selection of \nparticipating cities and countries. The CAST air pollution and health index will be applied to the \nCitiesACT  air  quality  database,  including  a  time  series  of  air  quality  data  for  more  than  \n400 Asian cities, to prepare a shortlist of 50 cities.6 Draft criteria will be developed to select \n                                                 \n6 The CAST is an Excel-based tool incorporating three indexes: (i) air pollution and health, (ii) clean air management \ncapacity, and (iii) clean air policies and actions. The air pollution and health index assesses air pollution of cities \nusing World Health Organization guideline values and interim targets. The clean air management capacity index \nassesses a city\u2019s capacity to (i) determine sources of emissions and their contribution; (ii) assess the status of \nAQM (includes monitoring, modeling, data analysis, and reporting); (iii) estimate impacts on health, environment, \nand economy; and (iv) reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions through an institutional and policy \nframework and financing. The clean air policies and actions index assesses the existence and enforcement of \n ", "       3\ncities  with  small,  medium-sized,  and  large  populations  to  participate  as  mentoring  and \nbeneficiary cities in the south\u2013south twinning. Selection criteria may include (i) population size, \n(ii) recognition of air quality problems by the national environment ministry, (iii) city government \ncommitment, (iv) demonstrable experience in developing and implementing AQM plans, and  \n(v) planned or ongoing ADB projects under the Sustainable Transport Initiative or Clean Energy \nInitiative. Separate criteria will be developed for national twinning based on advancements in air \npollution  control  policies  and  their  implementation.  The  draft  criteria  will  be  presented  for \nrefinement at the Better Air Quality 2014 Conference to be held during 19\u201321 November 2014 in \nColombo, Sri Lanka. \n \n11.  The city criteria, including the CAST score on AQM capacity, policies, actions, and \nindexes (assessed based on secondary data), will be used to reduce the shortlist of 50 cities to \n10. The 10 cities will comprise (i) two small-sized cities (with population below 1 million), (ii) two \nmedium-sized cities (with population of 1 million to 5 million), (iii) three large-sized cities (with \npopulation of 5 million and above), and (iv) up to three mentor cities. The country selection \ncriteria will be applied to select up to four countries for south\u2013south twinning; a commitment for \ntheir participation in the twinning will be secured. A report will be prepared to document the \nfindings of this activity. \n \n12.  Output 2: Recommendations for the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s National Action \nPlan on Air Pollution Prevention and Control developed. As part of support to the PRC on \nAQM, ADB and MEP jointly organized a workshop in July 2014 to recommend measures for air \nquality improvement. The workshop made five recommendations that could have a far-reaching \npositive impact on air quality in the PRC. The TA will (i) prioritize implementation of the AQM \nworkshop recommendation in consultation with MEP, (ii) review the PRC\u2019s existing legislation \nand  plans  for  air  pollution  prevention  and  control  to  assess  its  comprehensiveness,  \n(iii) recommend key actions for inclusion in the PRC\u2019s National Action Plan on Air Pollution \nPrevention and Control for implementing the priority AQM recommendations, and (iv) propose \ncommensurate  steps  for  revising  the  Law  on  Air  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control.  The \noutcomes will be documented in a draft report to be finalized in consultation with MEP. \n \n13.  Output 3: Cities identified for twinning by applying the clean air scorecard tool for \n10  Asian  cities.  The  CAST  will  be  applied  to  the  identified  10  cities  to  rank  7  potential \nbeneficiary cities using population categories and to benchmark the CAST score for three \nmentor cities. Primary data on components of clean air management capacity and clean air \npolicies and actions indexes of the CAST for the 10 identified cities will be collected. The mentor \ncities will have a high rating of good or excellent in CAST\u2019s air pollution and health index and a \nminimum rating of good for clean air management capacity and clean air policy and action \nindexes. The beneficiary cities should have a minimum rating of average for these two indexes. \nCommitment from the higher ranked cities will be obtained to participate in city twinning as \nmentor cities. The aim will be to have up to three mentor cities, one each representing small, \nmedium-sized, and large cities to assist similar-sized cities in assessing and addressing their air \nquality challenges. While identifying beneficiary cities, priority will be given to cities with planned \nor ongoing ADB projects under the Sustainable Transport Initiative or Clean Energy Initiative.  \n \n14.  Output 4: South\u2013south city twinning arrangements established and air quality \nmanagement experiences and good practices shared by twinned Asian cities. South\u2013\nsouth twinning arrangements between six selected cities (three pairs, one mentor and one \n                                                                                                                                                          \nnational and local policies and actions to address air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions from mobile, \nstationary, and area sources. \n ", "4   \nbeneficiary each from a large, a medium-sized, and a small city) will be established. A letter of \nagreement  or  similar  agreements  between  the  cities  may  be  drafted  to  formalize  their \ncooperation. This will include commitment to provide resources (e.g., resource persons, hosting \nvisits) to participate in the twinning. The twinning activities will include (i) a visit from the \nrespective mentor city to the beneficiary city (within their population group) to assess the local \nAQM challenges, and share experiences to overcome similar challenges; and (ii) a workshop \nwithin each city population group (i.e., small, medium-sized, and large cities) to discuss potential \nsolutions and support the cities in developing strategies to achieve better air quality. A report on \nthe city twinning will be prepared and used to provide inputs for national policy and planning \nexchange under output 5.  \n \n15.  Output  5.  South\u2013south  national  twinning  arrangements  established,  and  air \nquality  management  experiences  and  good  practices  shared  among  participating \ncountries. The national twinning will aim to provide a platform to share progress and challenges \nwith AQM, and benefit from this knowledge exchange to enhance national AQM plans and \npolicies. Up to four Asian countries with serious air pollution challenges will be covered. Key \nactivities include (i) review status of AQM in the participating countries, including AQM policies \nand plans; and identify pertinent challenges in reducing air pollution; and (ii) prepare draft \nrecommendations for addressing country AQM issues. Interviews with various stakeholders may \nbe conducted to further understanding of national issues. The recommendations will include a \npotential  role  for  multilateral  development  banks,  such  as  ADB,  in  supporting  participating \ncountries in addressing their AQM agenda. \n \n16.   Two workshops will be organized for the four participating countries to discuss draft \nrecommendations (preparatory and finalizing workshops) and build upon countries\u2019 experience \nwith  successful  AQM  efforts.  The  country  twinning  will  identify  infrastructure  and  capacity \ndevelopment initiatives for air quality improvement that could be included in country partnership \nstrategies for possible funding by multilateral agencies such as ADB.  \n \n17.  Output 6. Study findings summarized in two knowledge products. Key findings will \nbe summarized as two separate knowledge products (outputs 1 and 2, and outputs 3\u20135) and \ndisseminated through green bag seminars, the ADB website, and participation in international \nforums such as Better Air Quality 2016.  \n \n18.  Major  assumptions  to  achieve  the  TA  impact  and  outcomes  are  that  the  city \ngovernments  remain  committed  and  allocate  adequate  financial  resources  to  implement \nrelevant recommendations, and that key individuals from the selected cities who participate in \ntwinning remain engaged in AQM. Major assumptions to achieve the TA outputs are that the \nparticipating cities and countries support making data and/or information available to complete \nthe CAST assessment and analysis of policy and plans for AQM; and governments, local \nauthorities, and other key stakeholders buy in and participate. The TA is subject to the risk of \nnot receiving the concurrence of countries selected for twinning in time for the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). No in-kind counterpart contribution is \nenvisaged under the TA. \n \n \n \n ", "       5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented by the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department, in coordination with other departments and offices and \nthe environment and urban development community of practice. The TA will be implemented \nover 2 years. A resource person from a renowned organization with international experience in \nthe  management  of  urban  air  quality  will  be  engaged  to  peer  review  the  TA  reports  and \nknowledge products. The TA will involve the United States Environmental Protection Agency to \nbenefit from their international experience in AQM. \n \n22.  The assignments will be divided into two components, i.e., phase 1 to be implemented \nby a firm engaged through single-source selection and phase 2 to be implemented by a firm \nengaged through competitive bidding. Phase 1 will require 4 person-months of international and \n10 person-months of national consultant inputs; and phase 2 will require 5.5 person-months \ninternational and 16.0 person-months of national consultant inputs. All disbursements under the \nTA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will engage Clean Air Asia, a Philippine-based \nnongovernment organization using single-source selection for outputs 1 and 2 under phase 1. It \nwill engage a consultancy firm selected using quality- and cost-based selection to achieve \noutputs 3, 4, 5, and 6 under phase 2. ADB will engage all consultants in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  The project officer will monitor the TA, and the environment community of practice and \ntransport community of practice will provide peer review. Good practices and lessons will be \ndisseminated through the TA workshop, postings on the ADB website, and at forums such as \nthe Better Air Quality Conference. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nMainstreaming Air Quality in Urban Development through South\u2013South Twinning, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources \nPerformance Targets and  and Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2019:    Assumption \nEnhanced capacity of  CAST AQM capacity index  CAST  City governments \nthe beneficiary cities to  improved by at least 20% on  assessment  remain committed and \nmanage urban air  average in the beneficiary cities  reports   allocate adequate \npollution   (2015 baseline: as assessed during  financial resources to \nphase 1)  implement relevant \nrecommendations of \nthe knowledge \nproducts.  \nOutcome  By 2016:    Assumption \nIncreased application  At least 50% of beneficiary cities  Event reports,  Key individuals from \nof knowledge and  indicate willingness to develop and  city government  the selected cities \nunderstanding of  adopt a city action plan for AQM   websites   participating in \nAQM by beneficiary  twinning remain \ncity governments   engaged in AQM.  \nOutputs  By 2015:    Assumptions \n1.
