INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support capacity building of \nthe  Government  of  Maldives  on  the  management  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nportfolio in Maldives. The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for \nMaldives.1 The TA will facilitate the delivery of analytical studies for country programming and \nfor identification of programs to address development issues.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Maldives\u2019 high-end tourism has propelled the economy\u2019s strong expansion over recent \ndecades. This has helped the country gain middle-income status, with the highest per capita \nincome in South Asia. During 2010\u20132016, the economy grew at an average annual rate of \n5.9%.3 The contribution of the tourism sector to the economy is expected to remain significant, \nas tourist arrivals are projected to increase (8.0% increase in 2017) with the opening of several \nresorts, the government\u2019s intensive marketing campaign, and the start of operations of four \nmajor  airlines  from  Europe  and  Asia.4 Capital  spending  and  construction  arising  from  the \ngovernment\u2019s planned expansionary investment program and private sector-led developments \nare expected to underpin economic growth. However, key development challenges remain and \ncould undermine future growth. \n \n3.  Geographic  and  demographic  dispersion  remains  a  big  development  hurdle,  as \ninvestments in key public infrastructure are costly for the government and less attractive to the \nprivate sector. Without a more effective transport infrastructure, private investment will not \nflourish because of the high cost of doing business, which lowers returns on investment and \nholds back employment growth. At the same time, poor connectivity between outer islands and \neconomic centers hinders access to basic social services. The widely dispersed population in \nthe islands similarly aggravates the uneven distribution of income and hampers the efficient \ndelivery of social services. \n \n4.  Maldives\u2019  narrow  economic  base  (tourism,  fisheries,  and  construction)  makes  it \nvulnerable to external shocks in the global economy. The limited access to finance restricts the \ngrowth of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The poor quality of and unequal access \nto higher secondary, tertiary, and vocational and technical education limits opportunities for \nproductive and decent employment, particularly across atolls. Vulnerability to climate change is \ninevitable because of Maldives\u2019 geographic features.  \n \n5.  ADB has supported the government in public sector management, energy, transport, \nand education. Concerns have arisen, however, that the impacts of ADB-supported projects \nmay be less than desired because of the government\u2019s weak capacity in country programming \nand project management. Contributing to this weakness are the lack of a national development \nstrategy, lack of capacity building training for government staff, and high turnover of government \nstaff. These result in delays in the disbursement of ongoing projects and imbalanced sector \nallocation, which further impede the achievement of desired outcomes. \n \n6.  ADB assessments of Maldives\u2019 country partnership strategies have consistently noted \nthe government\u2019s capacity weakness in project implementation, affecting the achievement of \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Lessons  point  to  the  need  for  continued  support  in  increasing  the  capacity  of \ngovernment counterparts to address this weakness.5  \n \n7.  In 2012, ADB approved  Strengthening Capacity for Operations Management, which \naimed to contribute to strengthening government capacity for operations management.6 The TA \nprovided various capacity building activities for government agencies in portfolio management \nand project implementation. It also supported the conduct of relevant analytical studies that \nhelped address some of the challenges mentioned earlier (paras. 3 and 4). These included (i) a \ndevelopment  study  on  the  Greater  Male  Region,  which  analyzed  the  overarching  concept \ndesign and investment plan for the region, as well as a proposed institutional framework and \nways to improve coordination among key state agencies; (ii) an assessment of the technical \nviability of various infrastructures; and (iii) the establishment of an information management \nsystem aimed at improving organization efficiency, advancing project portfolio performance, and \ncommunicating with development partners.   \n \n8.  An important contribution of this earlier TA was support to country programming and \ntripartite portfolio reviews, which served as venues for discussions on relevant programming \nand implementation issues. These discussions facilitated decision making and implementation, \nwhich helped compensate for the absence of a resident mission in Maldives. \n \n9.  With the closure of this TA in December 2017, ADB needs a mechanism to continue its \ncapacity building support to the Government of Maldives in analytical research and strategy \nplanning. This current TA builds on the achievements of the previous TA and ensures that best \npractices  are  considered  in  designing  capacity  building  activities  and  that  knowledge  is \nembedded as a value addition in project designs.7   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: sustainable investments across sectors \nenhanced.8 The TA will have the following outcome: portfolio performance improved.9  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n11.  Output 1: Sustainable development strategies, programs, and projects formulated. \nThe TA will build on the analytical study conducted under the previous TA on the development \nof the Greater Male Region (para. 7). The next phase of the study is the preparation of a \ncomprehensive  master  plan  for  the  Greater  Male  Region,  which  will  include  development \nphasing,  an  infrastructure  plan,  financing  modalities,  and  a  governance  structure  for  the \nmanagement of the Greater Male Region. The master plan will identify sector development \nstrategies that would generate economic activities and create jobs for the urban population, \n                                                \n5  Independent Evaluation Department (IED). 2015.

It will also take into consideration location-specific \nclimate change and disaster risks. \n \n12.  The TA will support preparatory studies for the next country partnership strategy for \nMaldives and other analytical studies to identify appropriate programs to address development \nissues. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Capacity  for  country  programming  and  project  implementation \nimproved. The TA will support the conduct of country programming missions, tripartite portfolio \nreview meetings, and consultation workshops on the master plan for developing the Greater \nMale  Region.  These  consultation  meetings  serve  as  venues  for  discussion  on  project \nidentification, implementation, and monitoring. The results of the discussions also feed into the \nannual  country  operations  business  plan.  The  TA  will  provide  capacity  building  activities \nincluding  workshops,  seminars,  and  study  visits  to  resident  missions  in  South  Asia. \nConsultations with various government agencies will be conducted to identify relevant trainings \nneeded by staff in the fields of project administration and management, and monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $558,250, of which $550,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u20136). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2.  \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodations, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury will be the executing agency and the Resource \nMobilization  and  Debt  Management  Division  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  ADB  will \nadminister the TA. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize workshops; \nand provide resource persons in the workshops. \n \n17.
