During  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  programming  mission  to  the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) in July 2003, the Government of the PRC requested advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) to support advancement of national food safety.  It was subsequently \nagreed in discussions with the Government that the TA should assist the State Food and Drug \nAdministration (SFDA)\u2014reconstituted in March 2003 from the State Drug Administration. The \nTA will assist SFDA with the addition of food safety under its purview, in formulating and \nproposing policy and regulatory changes, broad strategies, and plans for implementation.  This \nsupport  will  be  critical  to  help  SFDA  carry  out  its  mandate  of  providing  comprehensive \nsupervision, interagency coordination, and execution of key national food safety work.  \n \n2.  During the Fact-finding Mission on 1-10 March 2004, discussions with representatives \nfrom SFDA and other relevant national and international organizations confirmed the timeliness \nof  ADB  TA  to  strengthen  overall  food  safety  strategy  and  regulatory  bases,  as  well  as \nmanagement  coordination,  planning,  and  implementation  mechanisms  and  capacities.  \nUnderstandings  were  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  goal,  objective,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost and financing, and outline consultant terms of reference.1  \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Sustained social and economic development in the PRC have brought rapid shifts in \ndietary patterns of the population along with improving overall nutrition status. Agriculture and \nfood  production,  processing,  and  service  industries  have  also  changed,  with  advances  in  \ndomestic and export-oriented subsectors.  At the same time, persistent challenges remain, while \nboth  demand-  and  supply-side  shifts  pose  new  challenges  for  policy,  regulation  and \nenforcement, and food safety assurance systems.   \n \n4.  Existing challenges for national food safety in the PRC have far-reaching implications.  \nUnsafe  food  remains  a  serious  threat  to  public  health.  Weaknesses  in  monitoring  and \nclassification systems for food-related illness and food poisoning preclude accurate estimation, \nbut it is clear that these impose a substantial burden:2 recent events, such as the food-related \noutbreak of Hepatitis A in the PRC in 1988 (with over 310,000 cases), the outbreak of avian \ninfluenza in early 2004, and the poisoning of roughly 200 infants from tainted powdered milk in \nApril 2004 are among the most publicized examples.  Food-borne diseases impose sizeable \ncosts to society in terms of health expenditures and lost productivity.  The poor are most \nvulnerable to such costs, moreover, unsafe and low quality food exert a longer-term impact by \ncompounding child malnutrition (including via diarrheal illness), thereby depressing physical and \ncognitive development.  Additionally, particularly after the PRC's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization, there is an urgent need to bring PRC's food safety capacities and practices in line \nwith protocols linked to the international benchmark Codex Alimentarius food standards. Trade \nbarriers depress demand for the PRC's agricultural products and thus particularly affect its rural \neconomy. Finally, it is imperative to (i) rationalize food safety policies and eliminate gaps and \nareas of overlap in regulations, standards, and food safety control systems and mechanisms; \nand (ii) improve coordination, as food safety management roles and implementation are often \nhighly fractured across agencies and administrative levels.         \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 19 February 2004. \n2  Data from industrialized countries show an upward trend in salmonellosis and other food-borne diseases; unsafe \nfood is a key cause of diarrhea, shigellosis, cholera, and other diseases in developing countries.    ", "2 \n \n5.  Recognizing the need to address these challenges, the Government places high priority \non  improving  national  food  safety,  including  prerequisite  institutional  strengthening.  This  is \nreflected in heightened food safety efforts within line ministries and other agencies responsible \nfor key links in the food safety chain, most notably the (i) Ministry of Agriculture, charged with \ndrafting and enforcing regulations on food safety on-farm and in slaughtering processes; (ii) \nMinistry of Health, responsible for food-borne disease-related issues and food safety policy and \nfood  control  in  the  domestic  market;  and  (iii)  State  Administration  for  Quality  Supervision, \nInspection, and Quarantine, tasked with issues related to export and import, and ensuring food \nsafety  during  the  production  stage.  The  Government  has  also  taken  steps  to  enhance \ncoordination, including the PRC State Council's convening of a series of ad hoc multi-agency \nmeetings starting in late 2001 to promote dialogue on national food safety.  Subsequently, in \n2003, the Tenth National People's Congress authorized the establishment of SFDA as a central \ncoordinating  agency  for  food  safety  issues,  reporting  directly  to  the  State  Council.  The \nGovernment has called for proposals from SFDA and other national agencies, and sought \nadvice from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other external partners on (i) reforms \nneeded  to  strengthen  and  better  integrate  related  legislation,3  eliminate  gaps  and  mutual \ninconsistencies, and enhance enforcement; and (ii) enhanced mechanisms to educate the food \nindustry (ranging from agricultural producers to food handlers) and consumers on food safety \nissues.    \n \n6.  Food safety and quality are likely to attract increased Government and public attention in \nthe wake of the recent outbreak of avian influenza.  More broadly, the March 2004 session of \nthe Tenth National People's Congress has placed a greater emphasis on social development, \nas reflected in ADB-Government dialogue. The TA also links to and builds on ADB's ongoing \nsupport in the area of public nutrition.4 Fact-finding discussions confirmed strong interest among \nkey  international  organizations  in  maintaining  dialogue  during  the  TA,  to  ensure \ncomplementarity in efforts to support food safety in the PRC. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n7.  The goal of the TA is to protect public health and promote economic development in the \nPRC  through  the  implementation  of  a  coordinated,  comprehensive,  science-based,  and \nsustainable  national  system  covering  food  safety  at  all  stages  of  the  cycle  from  primary \nproduction to consumption. The objective of the TA is to formulate and build consensus on a \ncomprehensive framework covering food safety policies, laws and regulations, and standards, \nas well as cross-agency coordination to ensure their effective implementation. Specifically, \nbased  on  dialogue  among  all  key  responsible  agencies,  international  models  and  lessons \nlearned, and thorough analysis of the current food safety context in the PRC, the TA will: \n \n(i)  develop viable recommendations for (a) legislative revisions to address key flaws \nidentified in existing policies, laws and regulations, and standards; and (b) establish \na clearer articulation of roles across key agencies and improved mechanisms for \ninteragency coordination;  \n                                                 \n3  Relevant existing legislation includes the Food Sanitation Law, the Product Quality Law, the Agriculture Law, and \nordinances on animal epidemic prevention, pesticide supervision, and genetically modified foods.   \n4  Following the PRC's participation in three regional TAs on nutrition, ADB is assisting PRC, in close collaboration \nwith the United Nations Children's Fund. ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for \nStrengthening National Public Nutrition Planning. Manila.   \n  ", "    3 \n(ii)  formulate a unified food safety strategy framework5 for improving (a) supervision \nand inspection; (b) certification; (c) food safety assurance, including risk analysis \nand  hazard  analysis  control;  (d)  information  collection  and  management  and \nemergency response; and (e) education and advocacy for the Government, industry, \nand the general public, including improved mechanisms for public participation; and \n(iii)  identify priority improvements in technical capacities needed in these areas, and \nconduct focused capacity building within SFDA and partner agencies. \n \n8.  To achieve these objectives, TA outputs will include the following three studies: \n  \n(i)  a preparatory study (a) outlining the current situation and institutional context of food \nsafety  in  the  PRC,  and  (b)  reviewing  and  analyzing  comparative  international \nexperience under a range of national food safety models; and a summary report that \nwill be circulated to stakeholders, and will serve as an input to subsequent cross-\nagency discussion and research under the TA; \n(ii)  a published report outlining a comprehensive national food safety regulatory and \nstrategic framework for strengthening legislative and policy foundations and guiding \ncoordinated  implementation  by  relevant  agencies;  this  will  be  formulated  in \nconsultation  with  Government  decision-makers,  key  international  partners,  and \nrepresentatives of industry and consumer groups, and broadly circulated to these \nstakeholders; and \n(iii)  a  report  submitted  to  the  State  Council  providing  focused  recommendations  to \nimprove resourcing for food safety (in terms of both levels and allocative efficiency) \nand strengthen technical capacities, to implement key elements of the Framework.  \n \n9.   The TA's fourth deliverable will be strengthened analytical skills and a focused set of \nessential capacities built among key staff of SFDA and relevant agencies, based on identified \nneeds.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Under the TA's research and analytical studies component, consultants will work with \nSFDA to conduct research leading to the three main studies noted above. This work will build on \nresearch by the Development Research Center of the State Council and other relevant analysis, \nand will involve close dialogue with other organizations. Following drafting of the preparatory \nstudy report on legislative and institutional aspects, research for the more major second report \nand framework will include a broad gap analysis to identify key challenges obstructing adoption \nof science-based approaches, including the hazard analysis and critical control points system.  \nThe framework will also include strategies for (i) public education, to protect consumers, and \ncreate demand-side forces behind food safety improvement; and (ii) related advocacy and \ncapacity building for the PRC food industry.  Based on this work, the supplementary report will \nbe finalized after joint review by relevant agencies, then submitted to the State Council. The \nthree studies are sequential in terms of both logical ordering (each building on the foundation of \ncumulative work) and increasing ownership by SFDA and its partners. Preparation of the studies \nwill  emphasize  dialogue  across  relevant  organizations,  since  collaboration  and  information \nsharing will be vital to building consensus and ensuring the viability of final recommendations.   \n \n11.  The studies will feed into and complement the development and implementation of a \ntargeted capacity-building program tailored to address priority identified needs within SFDA and \n                                                 \n5  This will focus on achieving gains in the medium-term (5-10 years). ", "4 \nrelated  agencies.  Subject  to  adjustment  at  the  midterm  review,  this  will  include  in-country \ntraining  activities  targeting  roughly  50  key  central  and  provincial  officials  and  a  small \ninternational study tour for 4 officials.  \n \n12.  Workshops and seminars will be linked to research\u2014supporting information sharing, \nconsensus-building, and refinement of draft research outputs\u2014and capacity building, facilitated \nby the consultants along with supplementary resource persons where other specific expertise is \nneeded. This dialogue will be critical to mitigating the potential risks of (i) weak information \nsharing, (ii) poor coordination of national and internationally assisted efforts, and (iii) interagency \ndisagreement on directions and respective roles. Consultation of food industry representatives \nand  dissemination  of  key  findings  to  the  public  will  help  encourage  producers  and  other \nsegments of the food industry to assume lead responsibility for food safety in the longer term.  \n    \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $515,000 equivalent, of which $215,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $300,000 equivalent is the local currency cost.  The Government has \nrequested that ADB finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$185,000 equivalent of the local currency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $115,000, through the provision of office \naccommodation  and  venues  for  training  and  meetings,  counterpart  staff  and  allowances, \nmiscellaneous  administration  expenses,  and  support  for  capacity  building.  Detailed  cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented from June 2004 to August 2005. SFDA will be the TA \nExecuting Agency, with the Department of Food Safety Coordination (DFSC) overseeing day-to-\nday implementation. This will include organization of workshops (including proposal of qualified \nresource persons) and other activities, subject to agreement by ADB. To ensure timely provision \nof related goods and services, an advance payment facility will be established, in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants, and subject to terms \nlaid out in the letter establishing the facility.      \n  \n15.  A  coordinating  group  will  be  established  to  facilitate  interagency  coordination  and \nprovide guidance on TA implementation, and to help ensure the accuracy and relevance of TA \nfindings while building broad support across key agencies for final recommendations on policy \nand strategy and their actualization. The group will be chaired by the director-general of DFSC, \nand  will  (tentatively)  consist  of  representatives  of  SFDA,  Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, State Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine, Ministry of \nFinance, Ministry of Science and Technology, and Development Research Center of the State \nCouncil.6  Dialogue on strategic and technical issues will also be facilitated through workshops, \nseminars,  and  informal  meetings.    Broad  stakeholder  ownership  of  the  process  is  vital  to \nensuring that the TA promotes SFDA's ability to deliver on its mandate to provide overarching \ncoordination  on  food  safety  issues  and  responses,  while  dialogue  with  international \norganizations involved in the PRC\u2019s food safety efforts will help to ensure consistency and \ncomplementarity across related efforts.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Group constituency and structure will be finalized during the inception mission.  \n  ", "    5 \n16.  ADB will directly select the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office to mobilize needed \nconsultant services, with direct support and supervision to be provided by the WHO office in the \nPRC. The engagement of WHO will follow ADB Guidelines on Use of Consultants. A team of \nconsultants will provide expert inputs, including research and analysis, policy and institutional \nadvice, and a needs-tailored capacity building program for SFDA and related agencies.  An \ninternational expert on national food safety strategy and systems (6 person-months) will provide \noversight to four domestic consultants (totaling 18 person-months) covering (i) food safety \npolicy, statutes, and standards; (ii) food safety administration and enforcement; (iii) food safety \nsurveillance and inspection; and (iv) food production chain analysis. Outline terms of reference \nfor the consultant team are in Appendix 3. ADB may consider recruiting supplementary, short-\nterm domestic consultants if needed to provide focused expert inputs, following ADB procedures \nfor the selection and engagement of consultants. \n     \n17.  WHO, which has recently conducted in-depth situation analysis on food safety in the \nPRC, is uniquely qualified for this role in view of its (i) sustained relationship with SFDA and its \npredecessor;  (ii)  strong  on-the-ground  presence  in  the  PRC  and  linkages  with  other  key \nagencies  covering  various  facets  of  food  safety  (further  strengthened  by  avian  influenza \nresponse  efforts),  as  well  as  the  international  community;7  and  (iii)  specialized  technical \nexpertise spanning food safety fields and unique ability to draw on models from a wide range of \ncountries. WHO's specialized expertise will be key in addressing sensitive issues of inter-\nagency role delineation under the TA, and will ensure that TA findings enter directly into high-\nlevel  national  policy  dialogue.  This  partnership  will  also  build  on  successful  ADB-WHO \ncollaboration under related TA in Viet Nam8 and partnership in efforts to combat severe acute \nrespiratory syndrome in the PRC9 and other parts of Asia,10 and WHO has indicated it will seek \nto leverage additional resources for follow-on support on food safety in the PRC. \n \n18.  The final draft of the supplementary report will be submitted to the State Council. Study \nreports will be produced in English and Chinese, and distributed widely to key stakeholders to \nmaximize their impact.    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENTS DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by Japan Special Fund for the \nNational Food Safety Regulatory and Strategic Framework, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n                                                 \n7  This includes dialogue with bilateral agencies, and WHO has already agreed on common principals for addressing \nPRC  food  safety  with  the  United  Nations  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization,  United  Nations  Industrial \nDevelopment Organization, and World Bank. \n8   WHO provided consultancy inputs under TA 3483-VIE: Capacity Building for Prevention of Food Borne Diseases  \n(approved in August 2000 in the amount of $500,000 equivalent; JSF-funded). \n9  ADB. 2003.

Implementation of Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  National  Food  Safety  Regulatory  and  Strategic \nFramework will require the services of a consultant team.1 The team will be mobilized and \ncoordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The team will consist of 1 international \nand 4 domestic consultants, subject to adjustment as may be agreed by ADB. The consultants \nwill be responsible for carrying out the duties outlined in the following paragraphs, as well as \nany specific tasks that may be reasonably requested by the ADB, in dialogue with the State \nFood and Drug Administration (SFDA, the TA Executing Agency). Work will be based on a \nthorough review of institutional aspects of food safety in the PRC and existing and planned \npolicies and initiatives, as well as continued dialogue with relevant national and international to \navoid duplication and ensure consistency and complementarity across efforts.2  Background \nstudy will also assess key obstacles to adoption of science-based approaches (e.g., the Hazard \nAnalysis  and  Critical  Control  Points  system),  and  systematic  gaps  vis-\u00e0-vis  international \nstandards and practices.  \n   \n2.  In addition to providing ongoing guidance to SFDA as needed, the consultants will work \nclosely with SFDA in carrying out the three major studies. The consultants will (i) take the lead \nrole in identifying gaps and areas of overlap in the PRC, and proposing solutions in view of \ninternational models and experience; (ii) provide principal analytical inputs to guide the strategic \nand regulatory framework aimed at resolving identified weaknesses; and (iii) provide focused \nfollow-up during the third study, as a support to SFDA in proposing specific action for priority \nimplementation, developed in dialogue with other agencies. The studies will thus be sequential, \nbuilding on the foundation of cumulative work and in terms of increasing ownership by SFDA \nand its partners.  Study reports will be produced in English and Chinese, for wide distribution.  \nUnless otherwise agreed by ADB, WHO will formulate and organize and/or directly implement \ncapacity-building activities: (i) one or more international study visits; and (ii) a tailored in-country \nprogram, based on identified needs.  Plans for these activities\u2014including objectives, venue(s), \nand participant selection\u2014will be approved by ADB. \n \nA.  International Consultants \n \n3.
