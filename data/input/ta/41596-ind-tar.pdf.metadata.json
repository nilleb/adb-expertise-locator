The State Government of Assam (GOA) has been promoting the use of information and \ncommunications technology (ICT) for implementing governance, fiscal and financial management \nreforms  under  an  integrated  management  information  system  (MIS).  However,  one  of  the \nprerequisites of an integrated MIS is the availability of a reliable, robust and cost-effective network \nconnecting  all  GOA  offices  and  departments.  The  financial  sustainability  of  a  network  for  e-\ngovernance in Assam has been a major issue for the GOA, as the investment requires long \npayback because of high infrastructure costs and low rates of return. The GOA is therefore looking \nfor a cost-efficient technology which can help establish the infrastructure for last-mile connectivity \nand expand the ICT network across Assam, despite the limited financial resources available. \n \n2.  The major components will include: (i) development of an investment plan to expand the ICT \ninfrastructure for a wider e-governance network, and to improve ICT accessibility in remote rural \nareas;  (ii)  development  of  a  broad  regulatory  and  institutional  framework,  including  capacity \ndevelopment plan which facilitates the expansion of ICT accessibility and provides the platform for \nimplementing  e-governance  applications  over  the  long-term;  (iii)  a  feasibility  study  for  a  cost- \nefficient  technology  for  expanding  the  Assam  State  Wide  Area  Network  (ASWAN)1 through \nprovision of last-mile connectivity solution; and (iv) assistance to the GOA to enable it to implement \na pilot project in designated areas based on findings of the feasibility study. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program update for India, 2006\u2013\n2008 included support for governance and public resource management reforms in the state of \nAssam.2 A fact-finding mission visited Assam in July 2007 and reached an understanding with the \nGOA on the purpose and output of the TA and on its methodology, key activities, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  Digital Divide in Assam \n \n4.  Although Assam is rich in natural resources, particularly petroleum, coal, and forests, and \nhas good potential for agricultural development, its economic performance has lagged behind that \nof the rest of India.3  The literacy rate of its 26.6 million people at 64.3% is considerably lower than \nthe national average of 74.8%. About 35% of Assam\u2019s population (slightly higher than the national \naverage) falls below the poverty line of Rs400 per capita per month. The state\u2019s remote location in \nthe northeast of India, poor infrastructure, as well as an inability to limit crop damage from frequent \nfloods, have contributed to its low economic growth.  \n \n                                                 \n1  A good communications network is the backbone of any e-governance initiative and efficient e-governance should have \ninfrastructure in place for the citizens to access government websites for interaction and transactions. ASWAN, a \nproject under the National e-Governance Plan, is being implemented in two phases to cover all designated 304 \nnumbers of major points of presence to access government websites across Assam. Given the magnitude of the project, \nphased implementation is envisaged for a smooth roll-out of the various services to be provided by the proposed \nnetwork. The work started in February 2007. \n2  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update: India 2006\u20132008. Manila. The TA first appeared in ADB Business \nOpportunities on 30 August 2007. \n3  Government of Assam. Economic Survey Assam (2004\u20132005), Report on the Twelfth Finance Commission (2005\u2013\n2010).  \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Assam, which accounts for 2.6% of India\u2019s population, has only 500,000 landline telephone \nconnections (1.26% of the national total) and about 3 million mobile connections (2.01% of the total). \nThis also translates to low internet connectivity. For example, only 15% of 3,000 government-\nfunded schools are connected to the internet. A low level of urbanization is often matched by a \nlarge digital divide and this is certainly the case in Assam. The 13% of the people living in urban \nareas account for 65% of landline and 83% of mobile telephone connections, the remainder being \nin the state\u2019s 26,247 villages. Government-funded schools in the cities are five times more likely to \nbe connected to the internet than their rural counterparts\u201422% versus 4%. The wage earning \npotential of a rural resident is considerably lower than that of an urban worker, at least in part \nbecause of a lack of access to information on the internet. Most children in rural schools\u2014Assam\u2019s \nnext generation\u2014face a similar disadvantage.  \n \nB.  Background and Linkage to Country Strategy  \n6.  Good governance requires that all systems, procedures and policies of governments be \ntransparent,  accountable  and  effective.  For  this  to  happen,  it  needs  efficient  interfaces  to \ncommunicate with the public, and all citizens must have better access to information. India\u2019s Right \nto Information Act gives each citizen the power to demand information on any matter of public \ninterest. E-governance is a very powerful tool for this purpose, and if used properly, it can also \nreduce costs, enhance revenues, and improve the delivery of all public services. The National e-\nGovernance Plan (NeGP) for 2003\u20132007 seeks to lay the foundation and provide the impetus for \nlong-term growth of e-governance in India. The plan seeks to create the right governance and \ninstitutional mechanisms, and set up the core infrastructure and policies to enhance a citizen-centric \nand business-centric environment for governance.  \n7.  The Government of India\u2019s NeGP has proposed that all state governments take the lead in \nbuilding a broad framework to expedite the implementation of mission mode projects (MMPs) \ncovering agriculture, land records, transport, Gram Panchayats,4 municipalities, registration, police \nand employment exchange, commercial taxes, health and family welfare, forest, and treasuries. \nHowever, neither e-governance nor e-commerce is possible without network infrastructure. Lack of \ncheap and easy access to the internet is particularly important in rural areas. Private sector internet \nservice providers are confined largely to urban regions, where an infrastructure backbone already \nexists, there is a higher density of paying customers, and traditional technologies are profitable. \nConnecting remote and sparsely populated rural areas has not been attractive to the private sector, \nwhich believes that returns would not justify the large initial investment and requires longer payback \nperiod than more commercially viable investment projects.  \n \n8.  Despite these obstacles, rural areas in Assam and throughout India need ICT to provide  \n(i) information on markets, prices, and business opportunities in agribusiness; (ii) information on \nemployment opportunities and entrepreneurship; (iii) delivery of formal and informal education and \nskills training; and (iv) e-governance public services. This availability of internet access and the \nconsequent e-governance and e-commerce services would enhance the life of many in the rural \narea in Assam and allow them to tap finance, market information and services.  \n \n9.  The GOA has promoted the use of ICT for governance, fiscal and financial management, \nand  capacity  development.  It  is  modernizing  its  financial  management  system,  enhancing \ngovernance,  and  strengthening  transparency  and  accountability.  The  Assam  Governance  and \n                                                 \n4   It means e-governance initiative for rural development in a state government.   \n ", "  3\nPublic Resource Management (AGPRM) Project Loan5 provides the foundation for developing and \nimplementing an integrated government financial management information system (IGFMIS) across \nthe GOA. A prerequisite of the IGFMIS is the establishment of a reliable, robust, and cost-effective \nnetwork to connect all government departments and agencies and then to link the government to its \nconstituents through the proposed MMPs. \n \n10.  The expansion of public sector e-governance and e-rural development projects in Assam \nface serious problems of financial sustainability. The GOA will need particularly large investments to \nprovide last-mile connectivity between end-users and the ASWAN, a backbone network proposed \nunder the NeGP to connect all districts and the provinces in Assam. The GOA is, therefore, eager \nto find cost-efficient technology options that can provide internet services to end-users at a low cost. \nCost-efficient technologies, including broadband and wireless access networks, will be reviewed \nunder the TA to assess what solution is the most appropriate approach for Assam to meet its e-\ngovernance and e-rural development needs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be to help the GOA to (i) reduce the digital divide by expanding the \nASWAN  for  e-governance  delivery  in  rural  areas,  improve  ICT  accessibility,  and  develop  e-\ngovernance  applications  to  be  identified  by  the  NeGP;  (ii)  improve  the  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional framework for e-governance, and ICT accessibility and expansion; and (iii) enhance \ninstitutional capacity and human resources for operating e-governance applications and managing \nICT infrastructure.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The  TA  will  include  the  following  outputs:  (i)  an  investment  plan  for  improving  ICT \naccessibility in remote rural areas and for expanding ICT infrastructure for an e-governance network; \n(ii) a regulatory and institutional framework, including a human resource development plan to \nexpand ICT accessibility and provide the platform for implementing e-governance applications; (iii) \na feasibility study of cost efficient technology for last-mile connectivity in the expansion of the \nASWAN; and (iv) a pilot project based on the results of the feasibility study.  \n \n13.  Component One: Development of an Investment Plan to Improve ICT Accessibility in \nRemote Rural Areas and to Expand ICT Infrastructure for Expanded e-Governance Network. \nThe TA will examine the deficiencies in the ICT sector that have prevented greater penetration of \ninternet and telephone services in Assam. The GOA\u2019s initiatives to widen its e-governance network \nwill also be assessed. The investment plan will include a business model for a sustainable network \nbased on the kind of financial viability and profitability that would attract public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP). The business strategy in this model will contain an indicative budget for the first 3 years, \nrecommend the PPP approach, suggest potential PPP investors and prepare the PPP related \ndocuments. The TA will ensure that PPP plays a central part in building public sector ICT capability \nand in the management of this network over the long term.  \n \n                                                 \n5  $25 million has been assigned for the Project Loan (2005\u20132009) under the AGPRM to build institutional capacity of the \npublic financial management institutions and support implementation of an integrate government financial management \ninformation system.  \n ", "4 \n \n14.  Component  Two:  Development  of  a  Regulatory  and  Institutional  Framework \n(including a Human Resource Development Plan) to Expand ICT Accessibility and Provide \nthe Platform for Implementing e-Governance Applications Over the Long-Term. The TA will \nassess the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework of e-governance and identify areas for \nimprovement.  It  will  assess  what  institutional  and  human  capacity  development  programs  are \nneeded to improve ICT accessibility in remote rural areas and to expand the e-governance network \nand  sustain  the  network  over  the  long-term,  and  recommend  a  strategy  to  enhance  the \norganizational and management capacity of the key GOA departments. To enhance assistance for \nPPP  undertakings,  it  will  propose  capacity  development  for  PPP  cells  in  key  ministries  to \ncomplement ongoing assistance to PPP at state level, enhance knowledge transfer and public \nawareness of international best practices, and assist vendor development and design of a project \ndevelopment framework.  \n \n15.  Component Three: A Feasibility Study for Cost Efficient Technology for Expanding \nthe ASWAN Network through the Provision of Last-Mile Connectivity. The TA will prepare a \nbroad framework for implementing a robust, reliable, and cost efficient technology option for last-\nmile internet connectivity within the ASWAN. It will review the feasibility of adopting this low-cost \ntechnology in the designated urban and rural areas of Assam. Based on Assam\u2019s geographic, \ndemographic, and business demand, the study will advise the GOA on the most appropriate site for \ntesting the technology in the initial pilot project and a later expansion plan. The TA will also conduct \na comprehensive study of the existing technology, which will be taken into consideration in the \ndeployment of the innovative and cost efficient technology. Other related conditions for effective \nand efficient network design and technology will be addressed in the feasibility study.  \n \n16.  Component Four: Assisting the GOA to Implement a Pilot Project in Designated Areas \nBased on Findings of the Feasibility Study. Based on the feasibility study for low cost technology, \nthe TA will identify pilot sites equipped with computers, modems, and other facilities to demonstrate \nthe benefits and feasibility of the suggested last-mile internet connectivity option. The pilot project \nwill  include  three  typical  user  groups\u2014commercial,  residential,  and  government.  The  last-mile \nconnectivity technology will need to be: (i) cost-effective; (ii) easy for end-users to install, maintain, \nand access; (iii)  flexible and scalable so that the network can be readily expanded to support more \nnodes or users; (iv) capable of supporting functions such as intelligent (automatic and dynamic) \nrouting or repeating for reliable and stable network connectivity, while at the same time providing \nsufficient network coverage to remote and sparsely populated rural areas; and (v) compatible with \nenhanced network security measures to prevent outside interference, which is a prerequisite for \nmany e-governance applications. The detailed list of equipment and technology will be determined \nin consultation with Assam Electronics Development Corporation Ltd. (AMTRON), a state-owned \nenterprise involved in the creation of the ASWAN. The TA will help the GOA select an appropriate \nvendor  for  a  pilot  project  through  the  provision  of  bidding  documents,  including  technical \nspecifications and piloting requirements, the evaluation of bidders, and the contract negotiations. \nAfter installation and testing, the TA will help the GOA evaluate the outputs and advise it on how \nbest to achieve its goals. \n \n17.  Testing of the innovative and cost efficient last-mile technology may best be done in a \nsuburban or urban area, where more network connections are available. Once a technology works \nin the pilot project, it can be replicated for wider coverage in the remote rural areas.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $625,000 of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  administered  by  ADB.  The \n ", "  5\nGovernment of India will provide $125,000 equivalent in-kind support to finance counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, transport, and other expenses, including the facilitation of in-country studies \nand workshops. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Finance Department of the GOA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. AMTRON, a \npublic  sector  agency  under  the  GOA\u2019s  Information  Technology  Department,  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency. AMTRON will provide facilitation support for the project implementation in \nconsultation with the Information Technology Department. For this purpose, the GOA will provide \noffice  space,  furniture,  equipment,  and  counterpart  staff  for  TA  consultants  who  will  receive \noperational advice and guidance from the AMTRON Project Director. All procurement of equipment \nwill be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and all equipment will be handed over to the GOA upon completion of the TA. AMTRON \nwill be responsible for procuring all equipment.   \n \n20.  ADB will engage a team of consultants to execute the TA, comprising national consultants \nfor  52  person-months,  and  a  national  supporting  consultant  for  10  person-months.  A  firm  of \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). To select a consulting firm, simplified technical \nproposal and quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) will be used. The consultants\u2019 outlined terms \nof reference are in Appendix 3. The consultants will prepare an inception report, an interim report, a \ndraft final report, and a final report, and establish a fully equipped demonstration site. The TA\u2019s \ndeliverables will also include an investment plan, a report on the evaluation of expressions of \ninterests (EOIs) and requests for proposals, a bid package, report on evaluation of bidders and bids \nreceived, reports on evaluation of the pilot project and its outputs, and PPP-related loan documents. \nThe inception report, including a time-bound work plan for TA implementation, will be submitted \nwithin 8 weeks of the start of consulting services. An interim report will be submitted within 4 \nmonths of the start of consulting services. A draft final report will be submitted 8 weeks before the \nend of consulting services, to be discussed at a meeting of the consultants, the GOA, and ADB \nbefore finalization. The final report will contain all the necessary information and analysis. The TA \nwill be implemented in 11 months. It is expected to start in February 2008 and be completed by \nDecember 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.
