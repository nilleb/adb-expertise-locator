INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Uzbekistan asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare the Djizzak and Surkhandarya Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project. The TA is included in the 2006\u20132008 country strategy and program update.1 \nFact-finding was undertaken in January 2006 and an understanding was reached with the \nGovernment  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact  and  outcome,  scope,  cost  and  financing,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference2. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Uzbekistan  suffers  from  poor  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  services  and  a \nshortage  of  safe  drinking  water,  especially  in  rural  areas.  This  has  many  undesirable \nconsequences. Consumers incur significant time, costs, and inconvenience in coping with poor \nservices  and  many  collect  water  from  rivers,  irrigation  channels,  and  wells.  Unsafe  WSS \nservices are responsible for deteriorating public health and increasing expenditure on health, \nwith  the  poor  being  affected  most.  Inadequate  WSS  systems  result from  deficient  design, \ninferior construction materials and methods, damaged water supply equipment, the collapse of \ninstitutional  arrangements  during  the  country\u2019s  economic  transition,  and  insufficient \nmaintenance and rehabilitation. Given the lack of funds and the poor state of repair of facilities, \nthe quality of WSS services will continue to deteriorate. The capacity of the drinking water \nconsumers  unions  (DWCUs)  and  local  governments  to  implement  projects  and  undertake \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of constructed facilities needs to be enhanced. There are \nplans to expand water supply coverage from the current 65% of the rural population to 90% by \n2010.  \n \n3.  Since independence in 1991, Uzbekistan has been making a difficult transition to a \nmarket-based economy. The social and economic costs of the transition have been sharp and \nimmediate. Closing of facilities, privatization of public enterprises, and a falling budget for social \nsectors have resulted in service disruption and major price increases for these services. Social \nspending,  including  social  assistance  and  provision  of  social  services  including  WSS,  has \ndeclined sharply. A sharp decline in output since independence has contributed significantly to \nan increase in poverty. The economic transition has been accompanied by increasing inequality \nin incomes and in access to services such as safe and reliable water supply. Health and \ndemographic indicators show greater human deprivation in rural areas.   \n \n4.  The Government is conscious of the urgent need to improve rural WSS services through \npolicy and institutional reforms and the repair and upgrading of existing infrastructure. It has \nprepared a national plan for the WSS sector, including specific targets, actions, and a medium-\nterm sector investment program. The sector strategy includes (i) improving the capacity of \nDWCUs  and  local  governments  in  administration,  financial  management,  and  O&M;  (ii) \nintegrating  water  supply  development  with  improvements  to  sanitation  facilities;  and  (iii) \nincreasing access to safe and reliable WSS services. In consultation with partner organizations, \nthe Government has adopted a community management approach to the delivery of rural WSS \nservices to ensure they are sustainable. \n \n5.  The project area will cover two oblasts (provinces): Djizzak and Surkhandarya. These \nwere selected because of an urgent need to improve the poor condition of their basic rural WSS \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

The Project will link with ongoing ADB assistance in both Djizzak (the Urban Water \nSupply Project3) and in Surkhandarya (the Amu Zhang Irrigation Project4). In these two oblasts, \nabout 300 of a total of 1,400 villages are without safe and reliable WSS services. Of the 300 \nvillages, about half have water supply systems in need of rehabilitation and the other half need \nnew systems. The proposed project is expected to cover about 200 of the poorest and most in \nneed villages, with populations ranging from 300 to 8,000 people. In total, the Project will cover \nabout 250,000 persons. About half of the villages will be covered by individual groundwater \nsupply systems serving up to 20 villages. The other half will be linked to group water pipelines \nor interregional trunk mains. \n \n6.  ADB will help the Government to improve WSS services in the rural areas. This will \ninclude helping to implement the national WSS sector plan, strengthen the local institutional \ncapacity for the sustainable management of sector facilities, improve the quality and efficiency \nof  safe  WSS  services,  and  rehabilitate  and  develop  rural  WSS  facilities.  The  Project  will \nenhance rural WSS coverage, and contribute to improving living and health conditions, as well \nas  the  institutional  capabilities  of  DWCUs  and  local  governments.  Improving  the  health \nconditions of the poorest, in addition to addressing poverty reduction directly, will lessen the \nfiscal burden on local and central governments in the future, and thus contribute to a better \nallocation of resources in the economy. The TA is needed to prepare the Project and a program \nof capacity building for DWCUs and local governments. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will (i) review the sector WSS investment program, the national WSS sector \nplan,  and  the  capacity  of  institutional  arrangements;  (ii)  prepare  four  representative  core \nsubprojects for upgrading of WSS facilities; and (iii) prepare a sector project that will increase \nWSS service coverage in the two selected oblasts to 90% by 2012, thereby improving the health \nand quality of life of their residents.  \n \n8.  The Project will fulfill the immediate demand for potable WSS services in the project \narea.  It  will  cover  (i)  rehabilitation  and  extension  of  piped  water  supply  services;  and  (ii) \nsanitation, including improvements to public bathhouses and school latrines. The stakeholders \nand  beneficiaries  will  participate  in  designing  the  Project  through  consultations  and \nsocioeconomic  surveys  that  will  be  undertaken  for  all  subprojects.  During  project  design, \nconsultation  with  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries  will  include  women\u2019s  groups  and  poor \ncommunities in the project area. The Project will address poverty reduction, social aspects, and \ngender issues. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will consist of two parts (i) a review of the WSS sector road map, plan, sector \ninvestment program, and capacity of institutions; and (ii) preparation of the sector project. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001.

Part  A:  National  WSS  Sector  Plan,  Investment  Program,  and  Capacity  of \nInstitutions.  Consultants will carry out a review of the WSS sector road map, plan, and \ninvestment program. The review will include an assessment of physical, institutional, and human \nresources and a description of current facilities, planned future coverage, cost recovery, O&M \narrangements, private sector involvement, and related policies. The review will pay particular \nattention to integrated water resources management and environmental concerns to ensure \nwater resources are protected at regional and local levels. \n \n11.

Consultants will prepare the sector project, including four core \nrepresentative subprojects (two in each oblast) and appropriate capacity-building measures. \nThe subproject feasibility studies will cover (i) the technical, economic, and financial feasibility of \nthe  subproject  components;  (ii)  cost  estimates;  (iii)  an  implementation  schedule  for  each \ncomponent; (iv) resettlement, poverty, social, and gender analysis (the initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2); (v) community participation; and (vi) environmental considerations. \nThe Project has an indicative total estimated cost of about $35 million. The Government has \nasked ADB to consider a loan for $25 million for the construction of new WSS systems and \nrehabilitation of existing systems in the two oblasts. The remaining cost of about $10 million will \nbe financed by the central and local governments. \n \n12.  The Project will be based on consultations with stakeholders and beneficiaries (including \nhousehold surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions); the estimated demand for WSS \nservices in the project area; and the service delivery capacity of the participating DWCUs and \nlocal governments. Project formulation, with attention to financing aspects (local and central), \nwill  include  analysis  of  cost  recovery;  community  ownership;  private  sector  participation; \nfinancing options; fiscal impact; and sustainability (technical, financial, and institutional) for all \nsubprojects. Analysis of the Project\u2019s impact on poverty reduction will also be undertaken. The \nconsultants will undertake project framework analysis, including problem and solution analysis, \nto assist in the design of the Project and the selection of indicators for monitoring during \nimplementation. The TA consultants will coordinate their work with three ongoing ADB-financed \nloan projects\u2014Urban Water Supply Project (footnote 2), Amu Zhang Irrigation Project (footnote \n3), Western Uzbekistan Rural Water Supply Project,5 and Kashkadarya and Navoi Rural WSS \nSector Project.6 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $930,000 equivalent. The Government has asked ADB to \nfinance $400,000 equivalent. This portion of the TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government has also asked the \nEuropean Union (EU) through EuropeAid to cofinance the TA through parallel financing of \n$250,000 equivalent. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency costs, \nequivalent to $280,000, by providing counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative \nsupport services, and logistics. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.
