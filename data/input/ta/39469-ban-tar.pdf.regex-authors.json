INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bangladesh has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Strengthening  Results-Based  Monitoring  and \nEvaluation Project for possible ADB financing. From 20 to 30 August 2006 the Fact-Finding \nMission from the Bangladesh Resident Mission (BRM) of ADB held discussions with senior \nofficials  of  the  agencies  concerned,  including  the  Economics  Relation  Division  (ERD),  the \nImplementation,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  (IMED),  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor \nGeneral of Bangladesh (CAG), and the Foreign-Aided Projects Audit Directorate (FAPAD). This \nTA is based on the understanding reached during the Mission. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Government  attaches  high  importance  to  effective  project  implementation  and \neffective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of projects and sectors. In support, ADB financed the \nTA for Strengthening Project Portfolio Performance (SPPP),2 which was implemented from 12 \nDecember 1999 to 31 August 2006. The SPPP addressed the implementation weaknesses in  \nIMED and FAPAD, specifically of ADB\u2019s portfolio of projects in Bangladesh. Executed by  IMED \nof the Ministry of Planning, the SPPP focused on three critical areas (i) streamlining managerial \nand  technical  capacities  in  IMED,  (ii)  establishing  an  operational  portfolio  performance \nmonitoring system through a management information system (MIS), and (iii) strengthening the \nproject accounts management system and audit capacity of FAPAD.  \n3.  IMED and FAPAD have requested a follow-on to the SPPP to (i) review the M&E \npractices under all Government-implemented development projects, regardless of their funding \nsources, and strengthen the capacity of IMED and line agencies to implement results-based \nM&E; and (ii) strengthen FAPAD\u2019s audit management, audit systems, and implement personal \ncomputer-based audit formats. IMED is particularly seeking assistance to address the new \nchallenges arising from its important role in monitoring attainment of the sectoral targets of \nBangladesh\u2019s poverty reduction strategy (PRS)3 to assess progress made toward achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the year 2015. \n4.     M&E under current IMED operations is largely focused on indicator calculation and \ninformation collection from executing agencies (EAs). However, the PRS requires that IMED\u2019s \nrole be elevated to assess the impact of the Government\u2019s Annual Development Program on \nachieving program and sectoral results and targets. Therefore, line ministries must take on \nresponsibility for M&E at the project level, for which IMED, following project completion, will \nprovide network capacity development support. Furthermore, IMED\u2019s enhanced responsibilities \nunder the PRS at the sector level will be carried out in close coordination with the General \nEconomic Division (GED) of the Planning Commission, whose role is to monitor achievement of \nthe broader PRS outcomes and objectives at a macrolevel, and assess their impact on progress \ntoward MDGs.   \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 September 2006. \n2  ADB. 1999.

The PRS focuses on \ngenerating employment; improving nutritional status; improving primary, secondary and vocational education; \nestablishing good governance; improving maternal health, sanitation and drinking water; combating terrorism; and \nmonitoring. \n ", "2   \n5.  Consequently,  IMED\u2019s  mandate,  role,  and  functions  within  the  Government\u2019s \ndevelopment planning and M&E system require a systematic review in light of the expanding \ndemands  being  placed  upon  the  organization.  The  review  must  involve  participatory \nconsultations  with  all  key  stakeholders,  through  which  the  institutional  structure,  reporting \nrelationships,  and  human  resource  requirements  would  be  proposed  and  a  strategic  plan \nprepared so as to achieve an effective and sustainable M&E capacity needed to achieve the \ndesired outcomes of the PRS. The TA will develop and implement a reform agenda that builds \neffective and sustainable capacity, and support IMED in applying results-based management \n(RBM) concepts, in conformance with the understanding between development partners (DPs) \nand  developing  countries,  including  Bangladesh,  at  the  Paris  High-Level  Forum  on \nHarmonization and Aid Effectiveness (2005). \n6.  FAPAD was established in the early 1980s as an office of the CAG to audit all foreign- \naided projects in the public sector. The constitutional provisions of Bangladesh provide for audit \nof all funds under the Consolidated Fund, including aid funds, by the office of the CAG. Each \nyear FAPAD conducts audits of about 400 loan and TA projects financed by DPs and submits \nreports to the respective DPs as well as to the Government and EAs. ADB, like other DPs, has \nbeen relying mainly on FAPAD audit reports for assurance on the proper use of development \nfunds and to determine if any actions are needed on reported misuse or impropriety in financial \ntransactions under projects. Due to the enormous volume of work, and inherent capacity and \npersonnel constraints, FAPAD is not always able to ensure (i) quality in its audit reports, and (ii) \nthat loan and TA agreements are followed by the EAs.   \n7.     An interdepartmental workshop4 organized by IMED in January 2006 to assess the \nSPPP  recommendations  highlighted  that  a  number  of  reform  and  capacity  development \ninitiatives were preconditions to the effectiveness of IMED, as well as for RBM to be fully \ngrounded in the Government\u2019s monitoring mechanisms. The workshop specifically emphasized \nthe  need  for  (i)  enhancing  M&E  knowledge,  techniques,  and  skills  development;  (ii) \noperationalizing and expanding the IMED MIS; and (iii) a comprehensive study on capacity \ndevelopment with linkages to the absorptive capacity of IMED.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The outcome of the TA is to strengthen the organizational capacity of IMED and FAPAD \nthrough qualitative changes in their structure, functions, reporting relationships, M&E and audit \ncapacity based on the principles of RBM. This outcome will enable the organizations to support \nmonitoring of the implementation of the PRS and achievement of the MDGs at the sectoral \nlevel, in partnership with line ministries and GED. The impact of the TA will be improved \naccountability and enhanced performance in delivering development programs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  five  outputs  below  will  (i)  provide  IMED  with  a  strategic  plan,  support  its \nimplementation through capacity development and training, and enhance its MIS to support \nresults-based M&E; and (ii) provide FAPAD with enhanced audit management tools.  \n                                                 \n4  IMED, Planning Ministry, Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. 31 January 2006.
