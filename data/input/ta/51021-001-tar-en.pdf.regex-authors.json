INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide an in-depth review of \ninternational experience in reforming personal income tax and social security contribution systems \nin areas relevant to the reform agenda of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The TA is part \nof a broader initiative by the government to reform the tax and social security contribution systems \nand bring them into line with the PRC\u2019s current level of economic and social development. In 2013 \nthe Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called for reform \nof the tax and social security contribution systems to increase the share of direct taxes in overall \ntax revenues and improve income distribution. These objectives were further developed in the \nplan for deepening fiscal and taxation reforms approved by the Politburo in June 2014, and the \nThirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020)1 approved by the National People\u2019s Congress in March \n2016. \n \n2.  The TA will draw on the experience of selected member countries of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that have demonstrated good practice in this \narea. Specifically, the TA aims to explore how reform of the personal income tax and social \nsecurity contribution systems can (i) increase the contribution of personal income tax to tax \nrevenue; (ii) have a greater impact on reducing income inequality; and (iii) address distortions in \nthe personal income tax and social security contribution systems, notably those that affect the \nsystems\u2019 progressivity and give rise to inequality and labor market segmentation. The TA is \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for the PRC.2 \n \n3.  An agreement was reached with the government during a fact-finding mission on the TA \nproject\u2019s main features including the impact, outcome, outputs, activities, financing plan, terms of \nreference for consulting services, and implementation arrangements.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Since the outset of economic reforms in 1978, the PRC has devoted significant effort to \nestablishing an efficient, stable, and sustainable fiscal and taxation system. During 1996\u20132014, \nthe growth of tax revenues exceeded that of nominal gross domestic product (GDP), resulting in \nan increase in the tax ratio, from 9.6% of GDP to 18.6% of GDP. However, changes in the PRC\u2019s \neconomy since 2014 have reversed this trend, and the tax ratio declined to 17.5% of GDP in 2016. \nThis is significantly below the OECD average of 25.1% of GDP in 2014.4  Meanwhile, fiscal \nexpenditure needs are continuing to rise, resulting in growing deficits in place of the former fiscal \nsurpluses, and raising concerns about fiscal sustainability. \n \n5.  One reason for the decline in the tax ratio is that direct taxes contribute relatively little to \ntax revenues\u2014instead, the PRC\u2019s current tax system relies heavily on indirect taxes on goods \nand services, the growth of which has slowed significantly since 2016 following reforms of the \nvalue-added tax that sought to lower the tax burden on enterprises. The current tax structure in \nthe PRC contrasts with international experience, which suggests that as income levels increase, \ncountries tend to move away from indirect taxes toward direct taxes on income and property. In \n                                                \n1  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016. The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social \nDevelopment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2016-2020). Beijing. \n2  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2017-2019. Manila. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section \nof ADB\u2019s website on 2 August 2017. \n4  Data on tax revenue (excluding social security) in all OECD countries is only available until 2014. OECD. 2016. Tax \nLevels and Tax Structures, 1965\u20132015. In OECD. 2016. Revenue Statistics. Paris.  \n ", "2 \nthe PRC direct taxes\u2014such as personal and corporate income taxes\u2014contributed relatively little \nto tax revenue, amounting to 4.9% of GDP in 2014, much less than the OECD average of 11.2% \nof GDP in 2014.5 This is mainly because collections from personal income tax (1.1% of GDP) are \nmuch lower than the OECD average (8.4% of GDP). Therefore, one area that the TA will explore \nis how other countries have increased revenue from taxation of personal income. Improving the \nrevenue  performance  of  the  personal  income  tax  would  make  a  direct  contribution  to \nstrengthening the revenue base of the budget. It could also potentially provide local governments \nwith a robust independent source of revenue, if reforms are introduced empowering them to \nimpose personal income tax surcharges.    \n \n6.  The redistributive effect of taxes and transfers is still relatively limited in the PRC. Income \ninequality in the PRC, as measured by the Gini coefficient, remains relatively high. Estimates from \nvarious sources indicate the Gini coefficient was low in the mid-1980s (below 0.30) but rose to \n0.49 in 2008 and remained around 0.46 since 2015.6 Fiscal policy appears to do relatively little to \nnarrow inequality, as reflected in the difference between Gini coefficients before and after taxes \nand transfers. Therefore, another area that the TA will explore is how personal income tax and \nsocial security contribution systems in other countries have been designed to increase their \ncontribution to narrowing income inequality. It will also explore the steps taken to ensure that the \npersonal income tax and social security contribution systems do not generate distortions in the \nlabor market, including those stemming from high effective tax rates on wage income.  \n \n7.  A preliminary literature review suggests that there are two features of the personal income \ntax and social security contribution systems in the PRC that the TA study could focus on:  \n \n(i)  The base for collecting personal income tax in the PRC is very small, relative to \nOECD economies. A number of factors appear to contribute to this. First, the \nhighest marginal tax rate for personal income (45%) starts at the very top of the \nincome distribution (about 35 times the national average wage) and consequently \napplies to few income earners; in contrast, the top marginal tax rates in OECD \ncountries are imposed at around 4 times the national average wage. Second, the \npersonal income tax has a relatively high basic allowance (CNY42,000 or twice the \naverage national wage); in comparison, the average basic personal allowance in \nOECD countries is about one-quarter of the average national wage. As a result, \nless than 20% of workers are liable to pay personal income tax\u2014individuals paying \npersonal income tax in the PRC accounted for just 3% of the total population in \n2016.7 \n(ii)  The effective contribution rate under the social security contribution system is \nhighly regressive in the PRC. Employers and employees contribute to pension, \nmedical  insurance,  and  unemployment  insurance  systems.  Contributions  are \nwithheld from wages and remitted directly by employers. Although  employee \ncontributions are raised via a flat, ad valorem rate on earnings, the contributions \nare subject to both a floor and a ceiling. The minimum employee contribution is \nbased on an imputed earning set at 60% of the previous year\u2019s average wage in \nthe locality. The ceiling is based on an imputed earning set at three times that \naverage wage. It is estimated that around 30% of the urban labor force earns below \nthe 60% threshold in several large cities. The current combination of a floor and a \n                                                \n5  OECD. 2016. Revenue Statistics. Paris. \n6  J. Zhuang and S. Li. 2016.

Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund. \n ", "3 \nceiling on contributions therefore implies an effective contribution rate schedule \nthat is highly regressive. This is detrimental to income equality, and may also \ncontribute to the high degree of labor market segmentation present in the PRC.  \n \n8.  The proposed TA provides an opportunity for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nengage on a policy issue that is central to the government\u2019s economic reform agenda. As noted \n(para. 1), this policy issue was an important component of the Third Plenum reform agenda and \nits priority was subsequently reaffirmed at the highest level in government. Support for the \ngovernment as it seeks to make reforms in key policy areas that are essential for the PRC to \nachieve high income status constitutes part of institutional and governance reform, which is one \nof the five priorities identified in the ADB country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC.8     \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: the enhanced sustainability of the taxation \nsystem and equitable income distribution. The TA is expected to contribute to the following \noutcome: reform of the personal income tax and social security contribution systems accelerated \nin the PRC.   \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n10.  Output 1: Research studies on personal income tax and social security contribution \nsystem reforms undertaken. A main final report will identify key lessons from international \nexperience that will help the PRC reform its personal income tax and social security contribution \nsystems and align them better with the PRC\u2019s current stage of development. The report will draw \non relevant theory and international experience in designing and implementing personal income \ntax and social security contribution systems. More specifically, it will draw on case studies of six \nselected OECD countries that have managed to substantially increase revenues from direct taxes \nand successfully reformed their personal income tax and social security contribution systems.  \n \n11.  Six subreports will analyze the experience of the target countries in designing and \nimplementing relevant reforms of personal income tax, social security contributions, and other \ntaxes (where appropriate). They will focus on the following key issues the PRC government faces \nin implementing its personal income tax and social security contribution system reform agenda: \nhow to (i) raise more revenue from direct taxes, (ii) ensure that the personal income tax and social \nsecurity contribution systems make a greater contribution to reducing income inequality, and (iii) \nreduce distortions stemming from the severely regressive wage income taxation in the PRC. The \nlatter will need to be achieved while also ensuring that the PRC\u2019s social security contribution \nsystem meets the needs of a rapidly ageing society with increasing labor mobility. The studies \nwill identify key issues, challenges, and solutions encountered in the target countries during the \nreform process. The selection and design of the studies will take into account the different stages \nof social and economic development in the countries under study, and thus the relevance of their \nexperience to the PRC.9  \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2016.

The selection will be finalized at the inception stage of the TA. \n ", "4 \n12.  During TA implementation, two briefing notes will be prepared and submitted to high-level \ngovernment officials in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and other relevant ministries. \n \n13.  Output 2: Enhanced awareness and knowledge of personal income tax and social \nsecurity contribution system reforms. Supported by the ADB Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department, an overseas training seminar will be held to enhance the knowledge \nand skills of MOF staff regarding the personal income tax and social security contribution systems. \nThe seminar will also provide an opportunity for MOF staff members to exchange views with \ngovernment officials from other countries. A domestic training workshop on the international \nexperience  in  personal income tax  and  social security  contribution  system reforms  will  be \nconducted for selected participants.  \n \n14.  Other activities contributing to the output include (i) organizing a consultation seminar with \ngovernment officials, think tanks, and scholars to discuss preliminary findings; (ii) undertaking a \nworkshop to discuss the midterm reports of the TA project with government officials, experts, and \nscholars; and (iii) conducting a press conference to disseminate key findings to the public. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $375,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. The ADB will provide additional support in the form of ADB staff time. \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of meeting space, staff time, \nservices to the consultants, assistance in arranging meetings with counterpart agencies, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Economics Unit in the ADB PRC Resident Mission will administer and coordinate TA \nimplementation  through  a  One  ADB  approach,  (i)  in  close  cooperation  with  the  Public \nManagement, Financial Sector, and Regional Cooperation Division of the East Asia Department; \nand  (ii)  supported  by  a  public  management  specialist  (taxation)  from  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department and an economist from the Economic Research \nand Regional Cooperation Department. This ADB team will be supported by a team of consultants \nas described below. \n \n18.  The MOF Tax Policy Department will be the executing and implementing agency for the \nTA. The Tax Policy Department will be responsible for establishing a TA steering committee; \narranging meetings between the technical assistance team and relevant government agencies; \nreviewing  midterm  and  final  reports;  disseminating  TA  findings;  and  helping  to  organize \nworkshops, as needed.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from 1 November 2017 to 30 April 2019.
