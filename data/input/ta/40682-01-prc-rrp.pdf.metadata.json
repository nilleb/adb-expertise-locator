Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) were undertaken for \nAssessment  core  subprojects;  and  a  summary  IEE  was  prepared,  including \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures to guide the assessment \nof remaining subprojects. \n   \nProject Description  The project will improve the performance of the biogas subsector through \nthe demonstration of an integrated renewable biomass energy system in \nthe  poor  rural  areas  of  Heilongjiang,  Henan,  Jiangxi,  and  Shandong \nprovinces, where the densities of livestock are almost triple the national \naverage  and  the  pollution  problems  from  livestock  farms  and  agro-\nenterprises are severe. There are 66 national poverty counties and 131 \nprovincial poverty counties in the four participating provinces, with a poor \npopulation of about 9 million. About 43% of the project\u2019s subprojects are \nlocated in these poor counties.  \nThe project consists of four components: (i) sustainable development and \ndemonstration of commercial practices of medium- and large-scale biogas \nplants (MLBGPs), (ii) effective utilization of biogas sludge in eco-farming, \n(iii) capacity development for improved sector performance, and (iv) project \nimplementation support.  \nThe project will assist about 118 medium-sized and large livestock farms \nand agro-enterprises in constructing biogas plants, and introduce a new \ntechnical specification to the plant design. The new specification involves \nthe installation of high-temperature flares in the MLBGPs to minimize the \nmethane  gas  emissions  during  maintenance  and  emergency\u2014this  has \nbeen a common standard in developed countries but not yet in the PRC. \nThe project will also demonstrate business models of centralized biogas \nplant  systems  to  improve  their  cost-effectiveness,  and  technical  and \nenvironmental  performances;  and  assist  25  subprojects  to  overcome \nbarriers to connect to local power grids to maximize the benefits of biogas \npower  generation.  The  project  will  also  support  subprojects  in \nmanufacturing of bio-fertilizers from the biogas sludge and in eco-farming to \nachieve the government\u2019s goal of \u201ccircular economy,\u201d which is to reuse and \nrecycle organic waste in rural areas, and improve livelihoods in the project \narea.  \n ", "ii   \nCapacity  development  activities  will  be  carried  out  to  (i)  strengthen \ntechnical service systems and human resources for biogas plant design, \noperation, and maintenance in the participating provinces; (ii) demonstrate \nbest  design  and  operational  practices  of  MLBGPs;  and  (iii)  develop  a \nperformance monitoring system to improve the subsector performance. The \nproject will also support the MLBGPs in connecting and selling electricity to \nthe local power grids. The revenue of the power sale will help improve the \nfinancial viability of the MLBGPs. \nThe  project  will  provide  consulting  services  to  assist  in  the  review  of \nsubproject preparation and implementation to ensure timely and effective \nproject implementation. \n   \nRationale  With increasing industrialization and improving living standards, the PRC\u2019s \noverall demand for energy has risen rapidly, posing severe concerns about \nenergy supply and environmental protection. Rural energy consumption is \nincreasing at a rate of 2.6% annually. Meanwhile, livestock breeding and \nagro-industries have been developing rapidly and are gradually changing \nfrom small household farms into medium-sized and large commercialized \nfarms. The number of medium-sized and large livestock farms reached \nmore than 19,740 in 2007, but only about 43% were equipped with waste \ntreatment facilities. It was estimated that livestock waste will reach about \n5.21 billion tons by 2010, and 6.76 billion tons by 2020. Because of the high \nconcentration of organic materials in the waste, anaerobic digestion is an \neffective  technology  to  manage  the  livestock  waste,  while  generating \nsubstantial renewable energy to help relieve energy shortage. According to \nthe  2007  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Development  Plan  for  Renewable \nEnergy in China of the National Development and Reform Commission \n(NDRC), about 10,000 large-scale biogas plants will be set up on large \nlivestock farms by 2020, and the annual biogas yield from MLBGPs will be \nas  high  as  14 billion  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  year.  As  of  2007,  it  was \nestimated that about 1,646 large-scale and 6,930 medium-scale biogas \nplants  had  been  constructed;  and  the  annual  biogas  production  was \nreaching 800 million m3. \nThe  government  has  established  a  comprehensive  policy  and  strategic \nframework on renewable energy development, and has been promoting the \nconstruction  of  biogas  plants  since  the  early  1990s  to  (i)  tackle  the \nenvironmental pollution problems of the livestock farms and agro-industries, \n(ii)  use  biogas  as  an  alternative  fuel  to  replace  fossil  fuel  and  reduce \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in rural areas, and (iii) reuse the sludge \nand effluent from the biogas plants in eco-farming to accomplish a circular \neconomy. The project will adopt a sector loan approach to supporting the \ngovernment and the four provinces in the expansion of the rural biomass \nrenewable energy system. The project also complements the government\u2019s \nstimulus package on biogas plant development to boost the construction of \nbiogas plants, provide training to biogas engineers and technicians, and \nincrease jobs to maintain social stability in rural areas. \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the project will be improved rural environmental management \nOutcome  and access to biogas energy. The outcome of the project will be improved \nefficiency of the rural biomass renewable energy system and rural social \nbenefits.  \n ", "iii \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $152.54  million \nPlan   equivalent, including taxes and duties of $4.18 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $66,080,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per year on undisbursed funds, and such other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the loan and project agreements. The Multi-Donor Clean \nEnergy  Fund  under  the  CEFPF  will  provide  a  grant  of  $3.0  million \nequivalent to be administered by ADB; the grant will finance part of the cost \nof the high-temperature flares and capacity development activities. GEF will \nprovide a grant of $9.2 million equivalent to be administered by ADB; the \ngrant will meet part of the cost of the construction of centralized biogas \nplants  and  capacity  development  components.

The provinces will make the entire \nproceeds of the loan available to the county and municipal finance bureaus \nat the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan for making subloans to \nthe enterprise beneficiaries, which will carry a repayment period including a \ngrace period not exceeding those for the loan, commitment charge identical \nto that of the loan, and an interest at a rate identical to that applied to the \nloan, and, as applicable, an additional interest spread on the subloans not \nexceeding 0.2%. The beneficiary enterprises will bear all commitment and \ninterest charges, and foreign exchange variation risk associated with the \nsubloans. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2016 \n ", "iv   \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date  31 December 2015 \n   \nExecuting Agency   Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) \n   \nImplementation  MOA will be the executing agency for the project, and the departments of \nArrangements  agriculture  of  the  four  participating  provinces  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies. MOA has set up a leading group comprising senior officials from \nMOA\u2019s  departments  of  planning;  and  of  science,  education,  and  rural \nenvironment; and the Foreign Economic Cooperation Center; the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF); and NDRC to provide policy guidance and support to the \nproject  implementation.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be \nestablished  in  MOA,  which  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nmanagement, coordination, training, recruitment of consultants, and other \nimplementation and monitoring activities. Each implementing agency will \nalso set up a provincial leading group comprising senior officials from the \ndepartments of agriculture, audit, environmental protection, and finance to \nguide project implementation. A project implementation office (PIO) will be \nestablished in each implementing agency to manage and oversee project \nimplementation  activities,  including  the  subproject  review  and  approval \nprocess. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nEach subborrower will engage the services of a qualified tendering agency \nto carry out the procurement under the supervision and guidance of the \nrespective PIO. Contracts for goods estimated to exceed $1 million and \ncontracts for works estimated to exceed $10 million will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods estimated \nto cost more than $100,000 and for works estimated to cost more than \n$200,000, but less than the international competitive bidding values will be \nprocured  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  in \naccordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to \nmodifications  agreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  for \nindividual subprojects where the goods estimated to cost $1 million or less \nand the combined cost of goods and works equal to or below $10 million \nwill be procured as turnkey contracts using the NCB procedures. Contracts \nfor goods estimated to cost $100,000 or less, and for works estimated to \ncost $200,000 or less will be procured using shopping procedures. Works \nvalued at $200,000 or less for the construction and upgrading of the bio-\ndigesters and eco-farming may be carried out through force account. In \nusing force account, ADB must be satisfied that the government\u2019s or the \nbeneficiary enterprises\u2019 facilities are efficient, and that the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  or  the  beneficiary  enterprises  are  capable  of \nundertaking the works on time and at the required quality at reasonable \ncost.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and \ncontracts. \n   \nConsulting Services  The PMO will engage an international consultant to support detailed design \nand  supervise  activities,  and  selected  PIOs  will  engage  individual \nconsultants to carry out specific activities, under the Multi-Donor Clean \n ", "v \nEnergy Fund. Firms will be engaged by the PMO and PIOs to support the \nactivities of the GEF grants. The consultants will be recruited in line with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto  time).  The  Multi-Donor  Clean  Energy  Fund-financed  consultants  will \nconduct  a  survey  on  the  performance  of  MLBGPs  in  the  participating \nprovinces,  and  develop  and  implement  a  performance  monitoring \nmechanism  for  MLBGPs.  The  GEF-financed  consultants  will  assist  in \ncapacity  development  and  project  management  for  the  design, \nconstruction, and operation of the centralized biogas plants, and special \nstudies.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  project  will  help  about  118  livestock  farms  and  agro-enterprises \nBeneficiaries  improve their waste treatment to meet national standards. In addition, about \n65,200 households, of which about 4,500 are poor households, will benefit \nfrom improved environmental and health conditions. About 7.0 million tons \nof waste will be treated, and about 92 million kilowatt-hours of electricity \nand an equivalent amount of heat energy will be produced and used each \nyear,  which  will  save  about  76,000  tons  of  coal.  About  1,500  poor \nhouseholds will have access to cheaper electricity. The project will also \ncontribute to the reduction of methane gas, a GHG, by about 1 million tons \nof carbon dioxide equivalent each year. About 4,900 temporary jobs will be \ncreated during construction, increasing people\u2019s income by CNY4,000 on \naverage; and over 1,400 new jobs will be generated during biogas plant \noperation, with a per capita income of about CNY13,000. About 9,000 poor \nhouseholds  will  use  the  organic  fertilizers  from  the  biogas  plants  and \nbenefit from savings on chemical fertilizers and incremental revenue from \nthe  sales  of  organic  products  from  eco-farming.  The  agro-enterprises\u2019 \nproduction capacity is also expected to expand after the completion of the \nbiogas plants and will benefit over 27,000 new contract farmers from the \nsales  of  livestock  to  these  enterprises.  Each  contract  farmer\u2019s  annual \nhousehold  income  could  be  as  high  as  CNY44,200,  compared  with \nbreeding farmers\u2019 average household income of CNY16,500. The project \nwill also provide clean energy to about 41,000 households and improve \ntheir energy consumption by replacing straw, wood, or coal, which will \nprotect the environment and reduce women\u2019s workload and health hazards. \nSome  enterprises  plan  to  supply  low-priced  electricity  and  gas  to \nneighboring villagers, which will improve farmers\u2019 access to energy.  \n   \nRisks and  The participating provincial and county governments, livestock farms, and \nAssumptions  agro-enterprises will share the repayment risk. The local governments have \nguaranteed the repayment of disbursed loan funds. In case of repayment \ndefault, the provincial governments agreed that MOF deduct amounts due \nfrom the public budgets of the county governments.  \nThe financial risk associated with lending to the subborrowers has been \nsubstantially mitigated through the stringent selection of subborrowers. The \nhistoric  and  future  financial  management  assessments  and  other  due \ndiligence reviews complement risk mitigation efforts. Market and demand \nanalyses were conducted, and all the subborrowers were found to have \nwell-established markets. Measures, such as capacity development, have \nbeen  designed  to  strengthen  the  financial  management  capacity  and \nmitigate performance risks.  \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) proposed administration of a grant from the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund1 under the \nClean Energy Financing Partnership Facility (CEFPF), and (iii) proposed administration of a \ngrant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for \nthe Integrated Renewable Biomass Energy Development Sector Project. \n  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In  July  2007,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) to formulate the project,2 which supports medium-sized and large \nlivestock farms in participating provinces3 in constructing medium- and large-scale biogas plants \n(MLBGPs) and improving the subsector performance. This report is based on the findings of the \nproject preparatory TA, government feasibility study reports, findings of ADB missions, and \ndiscussions with government officials and stakeholders. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  With increasing industrialization and improving living standards, the PRC\u2019s demand for \nenergy  is  growing  rapidly,  placing  severe  pressure  on  energy  supply  and  environmental \nprotection. Rural energy consumption alone is increasing at a rate of 2.6% annually. Pollution \nfrom livestock breeding and agro-industries is one of the most serious environmental problems \nin  the  PRC.  Because  of  the  high  concentration  of  organic  materials  in  livestock  and \nagroprocessing waste, anaerobic digestion is an effective technology to manage such waste, \nwhile generating substantial quantities of renewable energy to help relieve the energy shortage. \nAfter  the  ratification  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  2002,  the  government  has  been  voluntarily \ncontributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, and expects to convert 10% of its energy \nstructure to renewable energy during 2005\u20132010.4 \n \n4.  The livestock industry in the PRC has been developing rapidly over the last 20 years \nbecause of growing demand for meat and dairy products. In 2007, gross production of meat, \neggs, and milk reached CNY1.6 trillion, an increase of about 34.6% compared to the 2006 \nproduction level. In 2007, about 565 million pigs were raised, representing growth of about 8.9% \nfrom a year earlier.5 The number of commercialized livestock farms6 has also risen rapidly from \nabout 2.4 million in 2002 to about 4.3 million in 2007, out of which more than 19,740 were \nmedium-sized and large livestock farms.7 However, only 8,576 of these farms, or about 43%, \nwere  equipped  with  waste  treatment  facilities.  The  fast  growing  medium-sized  and  large \n                                                 \n1  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.  \n2  ADB. 2007.

Beijing.  \n6  Commercialized livestock farms are defined as those with an annual slaughter of over 50 pigs, 2,000 broilers, or \n10 cows; or an annual inventory of more than 500 layers or 5 dairy cows. \n7  Medium-sized livestock farms are those with an annual slaughter of 3,000\u201310,000 pigs, or 100,000\u2013400,000 \nbroilers, or 500\u20131,200 beef cattle; or an annual inventory of 50,000\u2013200,000 layers or 200\u2013600 dairy cattle. Large \nlivestock farms are those with more animals than the upper thresholds of the medium-sized farms. \n ", "2   \nlivestock farms has raised national concern over environmental issues associated with livestock \nwaste.  According  to  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  (MEP),  total  animal  waste \nexceeded 2.7 billion tons in 2006, which was 3.4 times that of industrial solid waste. The waste \nvolume is expected to increase as the country becomes the world\u2019s top meat and egg producer \nand tries to address the shortage of dairy products. It was projected that livestock waste would \nreach about 5.21 billion tons by 2010, and about 6.76 billion tons by 2020.8 \n \n5.  In  addition  to  the  increasing  livestock  waste,  agro-enterprises  such  as  ethanol \nproduction, vegetable processing, and livestock slaughter have become important sources of \nbiomass waste and pollution problems. The number of agro-enterprises in the PRC has been \ngrowing  rapidly  in  recent  years,  and  the  trend  is  expected  to  continue  as  urbanization \nprogresses. In 2006, there were over 16,000 agro-enterprises, with an average output of CNY79 \nmillion per enterprise. The amount of agro-industrial waste was estimated to be over 51 million \ntons in 2006.9 \n  \n6.  The government has been promoting the \u201cenergy-ecological type\u201d10 of biogas plants \nsince the early 1990s to (i) help solve the environmental pollution problems of livestock farms \nand agro-industries; (ii) use biogas as an alternative fuel to replace fossil fuel, improve rural \nrenewable energy uses, and reduce GHG emissions; and (iii) reuse the sludge and slurry from \nthe biogas plants in eco-farming11 to achieve the goal of a \u201ccircular economy.\u201d As of 2007, it was \nestimated  that  about  1,646  large-scale  and  6,930  medium-scale  biogas  plants  had  been \nconstructed; and annual biogas production was reaching 800 million cubic meters (m3). It is \nprojected that the large-scale biogas plants will increase to more than 10,000 units by 2020, and \nbiogas production is projected to reach about 14 billion m3 per year. Details of the sector \nanalysis are in Appendix 2. \n \n7.  The participating provinces are nationally important agricultural provinces and produce \nabout 30% of the nation\u2019s livestock and agricultural outputs. According to the respective 11th \nfive-year development plans (2006\u20132010) of the provinces, the planned annual growth rates for \nlivestock  products  range  from  1.5%  to  22.7%  for  2006\u20132010.  Livestock  densities  in  these \nprovinces almost tripled the national average. The commercialized livestock farms in these \nprovinces increased from about 1.0 million in 2002 to 1.2 million in 2006, which accounted for \nmore than 28% of the commercialized livestock farms in the PRC. In 2007, there were 1,732 \nMLBGPs in the four participating provinces, about 20% of the nation\u2019s total.12 The pollution from \nlivestock farms accounts for more than 60% of the total pollution in these provinces. More than \n95% of the livestock waste is discharged without treatment. Geographically, these provinces \nrepresent different climate zones where the design, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nbiogas plants need different considerations. They range from the colder Heilongjiang province in \nthe north to the warmer subtropical Jiangxi province in the south. The geographic differences of \nthese  provinces  provide  the  project  an  opportunity  to  demonstrate  the  best  design  and \noperational practices of MLBGPs under different climatic conditions, which will be critical to the \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2009.

Among the four \nparticipating provinces, the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of Shandong province is \nhigher than the national average. However, there are poor rural areas in Shandong province as \nwell as in the other three provinces, where job opportunities are few, and the living environment \nis deteriorating because of pollution from agricultural waste. The quality of power supply in \nthese impoverished counties is still poor, where the electricity cost is comparatively high to poor \nrural households. Many poor households are still using straw, wood, or coal for cooking and \nheating. There are 66 national and 131 provincial poverty counties in the project area, with a \npoor population of about 9 million. About 43% of the project\u2019s farms and agro-enterprises are \nlocated in these poor counties. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n8.  The  waste  produced  by  the  livestock  farms  and  agro-enterprises  contains  high \nconcentration of pollutants, such as chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, \nammonia nitrogen, and phosphorous, and is usually discharged without treatment\u2014resulting in \nserious nonpoint source pollution problems, and affecting agricultural productivity. An ADB \nstudy points out that the PRC\u2019s agriculture sector is the leading nonpoint source of pollution in \nrural areas such as Henan and Shandong provinces.13 The economic loss caused by rural \nnonpoint source pollution is estimated at about 1% of the GDP. Livestock waste also results in \nsignificant emissions of GHGs and increases global warming. In 2006, the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations estimated that the livestock industry produced more GHGs \nthan the transport sector. In the PRC, the 2004 National Communication on Climate Change \nestimated that the agriculture sector accounted for 17% of total GHG emissions, accounting for \n50% of national emissions of methane and 92% of nitrogen oxide emissions. It is thus crucial for \nthe government to manage livestock waste to achieve the goal of GHG reduction as committed \nunder the Kyoto Protocol. \n \n9.  On the other hand, the rich organic waste from the livestock farms can be converted to \nmethane through anaerobic digestion, which is an alternate energy to fossil fuel. A pig farm of \n10,000 pigs could produce about 500 m3 of biogas per day in a biogas plant, which can be used \nby 300\u2013500 rural households for cooking and heating. The biogas could also be used to \ngenerate electricity to power the livestock farm and neighboring households. Sludge produced \nfrom the biogas plants can be used as bio-fertilizer to replace chemical fertilizers by surrounding \nfarms  to  increase  crop  production.  It  is  estimated  that  the  removal  rate  of  pollutants  by \nanaerobic digestion could be as high as 90%.14 \n \n10.  Performance  of  the  existing  biogas  plants.  Anaerobic  digestion  is  a  mature \ntechnology that has been adopted widely to treat wastewater of high concentration of organic \nmaterials from households, livestock farms, and agro-industries. However, most of the MLBGPs \nin the PRC are not designed and maintained properly. The design and operation of the MLBGPs \nneed specific knowledge and skills to make the plants\u2019 O&M successful. There were about \n19,740 large and medium-sized livestock farms in 2007, but only 8,576 farms, or 43% of the \nfarms, were equipped with waste treatment facilities despite the government\u2019s environmental \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2005.

The design and operation of the existing MLBGPs are also unsatisfactory, \nlargely because (i) there has been no monitoring and compliance review of the performance of \nthe existing biogas plants\u2014once a biogas plant is constructed, there are no requirements for the \nowner to report to authorities the plant\u2019s waste treatment performance, gas generation and \nutilization  rates,  and  the  uses  of  biogas  sludge;  (ii) unlike  in  developed  countries,  the \ngovernment\u2019s technical guidelines for biogas plants do not consider the capturing of fugitive \nmethane emissions, which affects the effectiveness of GHG reduction of biogas plants in the \nPRC; (iii) the operations of the biogas plants are usually not cost-effective owing to the lack of \neconomies  of  scale;  (iv)  the  conventional  concept  of  running  the  biogas  plants  as  waste \ntreatment facilities does not realize the additional benefits of renewable energy; (v) technical \nand financial barriers discourage biogas plants to generate power and connect to local power \ngrids, which affects the biogas plants\u2019 contribution to GHG emission reduction; and (vi) there is \nlack of knowledge of and access to carbon credit as an additional revenue to improve the \nfinancial sustainability of the biogas plants. \n \n11.  Eco-farming. Intensive farming activities have degraded over 50% of the arable land in \nthe PRC, and are causing extensive soil erosion and desertification problems. One of the \nunsustainable practices is the extensive use of nitrogenous fertilizer in the PRC, which is three \ntimes the world average. The government has been promoting eco-farming to (i) recycle and \nreuse organic waste in farming activities; and (ii) reduce the use of chemical fertilizers by \nalternative organic fertilizers, such as the slurry and sludge from biogas plants. \n  \n12.  It is estimated that about 5.09 million tons of organic fertilizers are produced each year \nfrom biogas plants and used in eco-farming. Livestock farms usually provide raw waste, such as \ndung and slurry, free to neighboring farmers for farming purposes. Processed livestock waste \ncould be sold in the market at as high as CNY600 per ton. Up to 2006, there had been \n102 national and 300 provincial eco-farming demonstration counties in the PRC. The Ministry of \nAgriculture  (MOA)  has  developed  10  eco-farming  models,  and  demonstration  sites  have \nexpanded to about 6.7 million hectares. By the end of 2006, the number of \u201cgreen\u201d food \nenterprises reached about 4,615 with 12,686 products, an annual output of about 72 million \ntons, and annual sales of about CNY150 billion. Studies have shown that the use of biogas \nslurry in eco-farming could reduce the use of pesticides by 25% and fertilizers by 56%, and \nincrease agricultural production by 150%.16 The quality of agricultural produce has also been \nimproved. The application of the sludge in farms would also increase the content of humus \nmaterials in the soil and help sequestrate carbon and mitigate climate change. However, the \ndefinition and standards of eco-farming are inconsistent across the PRC. The government will \nneed to issue standards on eco-farming and establish a performance monitoring system to \npromote eco-farming and \u201cgreen\u201d produce, and realize the environmental and economic benefits \nof eco-farming. \n \n13.  There are 66 national and 131 provincial poverty counties in the four provinces. The total \npoor population in the project area is about 9 million, or about 3% of the total population in the \nproject area. The socioeconomic study shows that most of the poverty has been caused by a \n                                                 \n15 Wu Weixiang. 2007. Animal Waste a Heavy Burden for Environment.

Prevalent poverty and low income levels were \ndue to low farm productivity and lack of employment opportunities and sufficient knowledge and \nskills  to  secure  good  jobs.  The  investment  in  MLBGPs  and  their  associated  eco-farming \nactivities would provide employment and business opportunities, and help alleviate poverty in \nthe project area. A problem tree analysis for the project is in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  Government\u2019s policies and plans.  The  Agricultural  Law  of  2002  stipulates  that \ngovernments at various levels should develop their respective plans for rural renewable energy \ndevelopment.17 The Renewable Energy Law of 2006 encourages and supports the use of \nrenewable energy, including biogas. The law also requires county governments and above to \nprovide financial support to renewable energy use in rural areas. MOA\u2019s National Rural Biogas \nDevelopment  Plan,  2006\u20132010  supports  commercial  livestock  farms  to  build  about \n4,000 MLBGPs by 2010. The 2007 Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable \nEnergy in China18 of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) also supports \nthe  construction  of  biogas  plants  and  gas  power  generation  systems  at  commercialized \nlivestock farms, industrial organic wastewater treatment plants, and municipal sewage treatment \nplants. The NDRC sets up targets that by 2020, about 10,000 large-scale biogas plants will be \nconstructed  at  large  livestock  farms,  and  about  6,000  biogas  plants  at  industrial  organic \nwastewater treatment plants, with an annual biogas yield of about 14 billion m3 and installed \ncapacity of about 3 million kilowatts. As the concept of MLBGPs is just emerging in the PRC, the \nknowledge and technology of biogas plant design and operation are evolving. The government \nwill need financial and technical support in not only constructing the biogas plants but also in \nmonitoring their O&M to meet performance standards and the targets of renewable energy \ndevelopment. The proposed project will contribute to the targets of large-scale biogas plants\u2019 \nconstruction and uses of biogas renewable energy. \n \n15.  In the four participating provinces, biomass energy development is one of the key priority \ntopics  in  the  provincial  11th  five-year  development  plans,  2006\u20132010.  Each  province  has \nformulated its own rural energy development plan, with targets for MLBGPs\u2019 construction and \nestablishment of technical services. Henan and Jiangxi provinces also have their respective \nprovincial  rural  environmental  improvement  plans,  which  promote  biogas  and  eco-farming \ndevelopment as part of the \u201ccircular economy\u201d activities. \n \n16.  The national environmental protection planning in the 11th Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010 \nalso supports the construction of rural biogas plants and methane gas emission control. It \npromotes  the  conservation  and  comprehensive  uses  of  agricultural  resources  to  achieve \n\u201ccircular  economy\u201d  in  rural  areas.  The  Circular  Economy  Promotion  Law,  which  became \neffective on 1 January 2009, encourages the use of agricultural waste in eco-farming to replace \nchemical fertilizers, and to produce \u201cgreen\u201d energy. \n \n17.  MOA\u2019s 2006 Design Criteria for Biogas Plants in Large-Scale Livestock Farms provides \ntechnical  guidance  for  biogas  plant  to  promote  the  \u201ccircular  economy.\u201d  MEP\u2019s  discharge \nstandards further regulate that the sludge and slurry to be used for eco-farming must consider \nthe absorption capacity of the farmland and comply with hygiene standards.19 The Water \nPollution Control Law (amended in 2008) demonstrates the government\u2019s commitment to water \n                                                 \n17 Government of the People's Republic of China, MOA. 2002.

The law strengthens the environmental \nprotection responsibility of local governments, imposes much tougher fines and penalties for \npollution violations, tightens control of major pollutants, and establishes a waste discharge \npermit system. Commercialized livestock farms and agro-enterprises are thereby facing more \nstringent environmental requirements for their waste management. \n \n18.  Existing  PRC  regulations  allow  a  preferential  tariff  for  biomass  energy  projects  of \nCNY0.25 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) over that for coal-based power plants.20 Furthermore, the \ngovernment has been providing budgetary support for the subsector development. In recent \nyears, MOA has been allocating about CNY30 million\u2013CNY40 million each year to subsidize the \ndesign  and  construction  of  biogas  plants.  The  government\u2019s  financial  support  reached \nCNY180 million in 2008, when MOA recognized the great need for medium-sized and large \nlivestock farms to develop MLBGPs to comply with environmental standards and to use the \nlarge quantity of agricultural biomass as an alternative energy source for rural areas. The \ngovernment\u2019s 2008 stimulus plan provided CNY3 billion to subsidize the construction of biogas \nplants and the training of engineers and technicians. \n  \n19.  Development  coordination. Multilateral and bilateral organizations have helped the \ngovernment develop and implement its strategies on renewable biomass energy development. \nSince the early 1990s, ADB has been assisting the government in building up capacity for \nenvironmental management, environmental legislation, nonpoint source pollution control, and \nrural biomass energy. Major projects supported by development partners and their coordination \nare summarized in Appendix 4. \n \n20.  Lessons. Anaerobic digestion is a mature technology that has been adopted widely for \nthe treatment of wastewater with higher concentration of organic materials from households, \nlivestock farms, and agro-industries. Major lessons from the domestic experience and external \nassistance are summarized as follows: (i) as the rural areas become modernized, the medium-\nsized to large livestock farms will be the primary sources of biogas production in the near future, \nand  the  government  would  need  support  in  the  development  of  MLBGPs  to  sustain  rural \ndevelopment; (ii) the cost-effectiveness of the MLBGPs in the PRC is usually low compared with \nadvanced countries, as most of the investment plans focus on pollution treatment and lack the \nconcept of commercial practices; (iii) currently, the technical performance of MLBGPs is not \nmonitored  and  evaluated,  which  makes  the  biogas  plants\u2019  development  and  associated \nenvironmental benefits unsustainable;21 (iv) best practices for the design and O&M of MLBGPs \nand performance monitoring guidelines for eco-farming are yet to be in place to maximize the \nenvironmental  and  economic  benefits  of  MLBGPs  and  avoid  secondary  impacts  on \nenvironment; (v) without effective control measures for rural nonpoint source pollution, the \noverall pollution levels in the PRC will more than double by 2020; (vi) the institutional and \ncommercial modalities for biogas plants to connect to local power grid systems are needed to \nprovide incentives to encourage grid connections; and (vii) the treatment of livestock waste \nusing anaerobic digestion could be eligible for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) financing. \nBecause  CDM  is  a  performance-based  mechanism;  the  application  of  CDM  will  not  only \ngenerate carbon revenue but also enhance the success and sustainability of the project. \n  \n                                                 \n20 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, NDRC. 2006.

During the implementation of ADB\u2019s loans and TA \nprojects  on  biomass  renewable  energy  development,  ADB  missions  discussed  with  the \ngovernment the lessons from various biomass renewable energy projects and opportunities to \nfoster the sector performance. A major problem that the government is facing in implementing \nits biomass renewable energy policy is that the government needs not only to encourage \nlivestock farms to construct biogas plants to solve rural pollution and environmental problems, \nbut also to ensure that these biogas plants will perform to reasonable standards, and deliver \nand use the biogas energy to avoid secondary emissions of GHG. The project will (i) introduce \nthe state-of-the-art technical specifications, (ii) demonstrate business models for sustainable \nand cost-effective biogas plants, and (iii) prepare a performance monitoring mechanism to \nenhance  the  viability  and  efficiency  of  the  project\u2019s  biogas  plants  and  improve  the  sector \nperformance. The government will transfer the project\u2019s knowledge and experiences through a \ndissemination plan to various stakeholders to maximize the project\u2019s impact on the biogas \nsubsector in the country. ADB will also provide advisory support to the project\u2019s subborrowers \nthrough its technical support facility under the Carbon Market Initiative in accessing carbon \ncredit during project implementation, which will introduce additional financial incentives and \nrevenue to subborrowers and enhance the global environmental benefits of the project. \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Sector Investment Approach \n22.  The government has satisfied the eligibility criteria of ADB\u2019s policy for sector lending, \nincluding  a  well-formulated  sector  policy  and  strategy  framework  on  biomass  energy \ndevelopment, and sector institutions in central and provincial governments. The project adopts a \nsector  investment  approach  and  help  to  strengthen  the  enforcement  of  the  sector  policy \nframework and institutional capacity, specifically on the development of MLBGPs (Appendix 2). \nThe project supports the government\u2019s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol in reducing GHG \nemissions, and its sector policies including the Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for \nRenewable Energy in China (footnote 18); the Energy Development Plan in the 11th Five-Year \nPlan,  2006\u20132010;  the  National  Rural  Biogas  Development  Plan,  2006\u20132010;  and  the  four \nparticipating provinces\u2019 rural energy development action plans. The project is also in line with \nADB\u2019s core area of operations on climate change in ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u2013\n2020 (Strategy 2020)22 and the country partnership strategy, 2008\u20132010 for the PRC,23 which \naims to help the government improve rural environmental quality, increase access to energy, \nand  reduce  reliance  on  imported  energy  sources  through  development  and  utilization  of \nbiomass renewable energy. The project also supports the government in improving technical \nstandards, strengthening the cost-effectiveness of biogas plants, and fostering performance \nmonitoring of the sector development. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The impact of the project will be improved rural environmental management and access \nto  biogas  energy.  The  project  will  support  the  government\u2019s  implementation  of  renewable \nenergy development policies and strategies by increasing the number of large-scale biogas \nplants, enhancing technical services, and strengthening the biogas subsector performance. The \noutcome of the project will be improved efficiency of the rural biomass renewable energy system \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2008.

The project will introduce a new technical standard, business models \nfor MLBGPs, and a performance monitoring system to improve the environmental quality in rural \nareas, enhance the efficiency of biogas plants, and increase the productivity of the associated \neco-farming practices. There are about 118 subborrowers in the project, including 65 large and \n53 medium-sized farms. Four subprojects are state-owned enterprises, and the remaining are \nprivate enterprises. The project farms are leading enterprises in their respective counties and \nusually contract local small farms as their breeding bases. The social and economic analyses of \nthe  project  show  that  a  large  farm  could  contract  as  many  as  1,900 poor  households  as \nbreeding bases. The improved waste treatment of these large farms will improve the health of \nthe farms\u2019 operations; create opportunities for new jobs and expansion of the contract farming, \nwhich  will  generate  more  income  stream  for  neighboring  communities;  and  stabilize  rural \nemployment. The improved eco-farming practices will also increase poor farmers\u2019 productivity \nand the value of their outputs. \n  \nC.  Outputs \n24.  Output 1: Sustainable development and demonstration of commercial practices of \nMLBGPs. To maximize the use of biogas and ensure the sustainability of the project\u2019s biogas \nplants, the project will (i) support 118 livestock farms and agro-enterprises in constructing  \nMLBGPs,  and  introduce  a  new  technical  standard  of  high-temperature  flares  to  prevent \nmethane gas from emitting to the atmosphere during maintenance or emergency; (ii) support \nthe above-mentioned MLBGP owners and about 41,000 households in using biogas as an \nalternative energy source for electricity, heating, and cooking; (iii) support up to 25 biogas plants \nto connect to local power grids to maximize the benefits of biogas electricity; and (iv) pilot test \nand  establish  business  models  for  10  centralized  biogas  plants  to  improve  their  cost-\neffectiveness, and technical and environmental performances.24 The proposed 118 MLBGPs \nwill treat about 7.0 million tons of livestock and agro-industrial waste each year. The 118 farms \nand enterprises include 72 pig farms, 14 dairy farms, 7 cattle farms, 7 chicken farms, 8 duck \nfarms, and 10 agroprocessing factories. A summary of the candidate subprojects is in Appendix \n5. The details of the candidate subprojects are in Supplementary Appendix A. It is estimated \nthat the project will generate about 70 million m3 of biogas each year, of which about 8 million \nm3 will be fed to village gas grids for household uses, about 2 million m3 for heating, and the \nremaining 60 million m3 for electricity generation of 92 million kWh by the farms and the \nfactories. The installed generation capacity will be about 14 megawatts. It is estimated that the \nproject would reduce about 1 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) equivalent of GHG each year \n2\nafter the full operation of the project. \n  \n25.  In areas where smaller-sized livestock farms do not possess waste treatment capacity \nand facilities, centralized biogas plant systems and business models will be introduced and \ndemonstrated, whereby an enterprise or a larger farm can collect biomass waste from the \nsmaller farms and treat them efficiently and effectively. Especially in areas where smaller farms \nare  geographically  clustered,  establishing  centralized  biogas  plant  systems  will  be  more \neconomical and efficient than installing small-scale bio-digesters in individual farms. Moreover, \ninvestment and O&M costs would be lower as they can take advantage of economies of scale. \nThese centralized biogas plant systems are expected to generate enough electricity to be \nconnected to grids in a cost-effective way to further reduce CO  emissions from coal-fired power \n2\nplants. The concept of centralized and commercialized biogas plants is just emerging in the \nPRC. The project will help design proper contractual arrangements for waste collection and \ntreatment, pricing structures of waste treatment and biogas supply, and ownership options of \n                                                 \n24 Subcomponents (iii) and (iv), and their related capacity development activities will be financed by the GEF.  \n ", "9 \ncentralized  systems  to  demonstrate  improved  management  and  cost-effectiveness  of \ncentralized biogas plants. It will also support larger agro-enterprises in overcoming technical \nand institutional barriers to enable MLBGPs that have surplus electricity to sell to the local \npower grids. Two of the 118 subprojects will be borrowing for centralized biogas plants. The \nproject will provide further technical support through the GEF grant financing to build up to 10 \ncentralized  systems  and  introduce  capacity  development  support  in  demonstration  of  their \ndesign and operation. \n  \n26.  Output  2:  Effective  utilization  of  biogas  sludge  in  eco-farming.  Most  of  the \nsubproject farms have large orchards or farmlands to accommodate a sizable quantity of sludge \nfrom biogas plants for eco-farming. In line with the government\u2019s policy, the project will support \nsubborrowers to purchase (i) blending and mixing machines to produce bio-fertilizers from the \nsludge of the biogas plants, (ii) vehicles and equipment to transport and distribute the bio-\nfertilizers in farms, and (iii) seeds, seedlings, and other materials for farm production. It is \nestimated that about 5.09 million tons of bio-fertilizers will be produced and used for eco-farming \neach year, of which the subproject farms will use about 15% on their own farmlands; and the \nremaining 85% will be sold to the farmers in local communities. About 10% of the subprojects \nwill process the sludge with additives to produce a higher quality of fertilizers to be sold in \nmarkets. With the eco-farming practices, about 9,000 poor households in the project area will \nbenefit from about 50% savings on chemical fertilizers and increased productivity and improved \nproduct quality. \n  \n27.  Output 3: Capacity development for improved sector performance. This component \nwill complement the construction of the biogas plants with a range of capacity development \nactivities, including support to extension services. The project will provide consulting services to \nstrengthen the capacity of the extension service centers and provide advisory assistance to the \noperation  of  the  biogas  plants.  The  extension  service  centers  are  expected  to  sustain \nthemselves through collecting training fees from participants on a cost-recovery basis after the \nproject completion. About 400 local technicians will receive training to pass national tests and \nqualify for technical licenses to operate and maintain biogas plants. The project will also provide \nconsulting  services  to  remove  the  strategic  and  technical  barriers  to  the  grid  connection, \ndevelop guidelines for the government to promote the centralized biogas plants, and establish a \nperformance monitoring mechanism to improve the design and operation of MLBGPs and the \nsector performance. The outcome of the performance monitoring will include recommendations \nto the government on the monitoring procedures and associated institutional arrangements, \nperformance standards of biogas plants, and eco-farming definition and standards. The eco-\nfarming standards will include volumes and frequencies of the uses of bio-fertilizers, chemical \nfertilizers, and pesticides; and the limits of residue chemicals and coliforms in products. Training \non the O&M of MLBGPs will be extended to both the project biogas plants and existing biogas \nplants in nonparticipating provinces, such as Qinghai and Shanxi provinces, to enhance the \nproject impacts. \n \n28.  Output 4: Project implementation support. The project will provide technical support \nin  project  implementation  through  consulting  services.  The  technical  support  activities  will \n(i) assist in reviewing the tendering and procurement for subprojects, (ii) provide operational \ntraining, and (iii) assist in supervision of the construction and operation of the centralized biogas \nplants.  The  implementing  agencies  will  also  be  supported  to  ensure  proper  coordination, \nmonitoring, and evaluation in the provinces. \n \n \n \n ", "10  \nD.  Special Features \n29.  Introduction  of  a  new  technical  specification  and  a  performance  monitoring \nmechanism. The project requires the subprojects to install high-temperature flares to minimize \nfugitive  methane  gas  emissions  during  operation  and  emergency  maintenance.  Such \nrequirement is common in developed countries, but not yet in the PRC. It is expected that the \nadoption of this technical standard will reduce fugitive methane gas emissions, supporting the \ngovernment  in  fulfilling  its  commitment  to  GHG  reductions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol. \nFurthermore, the project will support the target of biogas generation and utilization as set up in \nthe Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy in China, and sharpen \nthe implementation tool of the Renewable Energy Law and related polices by introducing an \nenhanced performance monitoring mechanism. The mechanism will contain a set of indicators \nand performance requirements, and institutional arrangements for the monitoring of the design \nand operations of MLBGPs and of their financial and technical performance. \n  \n30.  Pilot testing commercial models to improve the cost-effectiveness and operational \nefficiency of MLBGPs. High capital cost is one of the obstacles to installing an anaerobic \ndigester. For small farms, it may be more desirable for two or more farms to share the costs of a \ncentralized or community digester. Centralized biogas plants could have better economies of \nscale  and  be  more  cost-effective.  The  small  farms  could  then  be  released  from  the \nresponsibilities of O&M of biogas plants.25  Most of the existing biogas plants in the PRC lack \neconomies of scale, which also increases the uncertainty of their operational performance. The \npiloting of commercial models of biogas plants under the project is expected to introduce a new \napproach to improving the cost-effectiveness of biogas plants, and enhancing their treatment \nefficiency and gas generation rate, which will largely help realize the benefits of renewable \nbiomass energy from biogas plants in the PRC. \n \n31.  Assisting subprojects in accessing carbon market to strengthen the profitability \nof MLBGPs. The CDM allows net global GHG emissions reduction at a much lower cost by \nfinancing emission reduction projects in developing countries. Introducing the CDM into the \nproject will bring benefits that can be replicated by other projects, such as (i) improving the cost-\neffectiveness of biogas plants with the revenue of certified emission reduction (CER) sales; and \n(ii) introducing advanced technology, and improving the skills and competencies of the CDM \nproject  owners.  Two  selected  agro-enterprises  are  preparing  CDM  project  development \ndocuments  with  ADB\u2019s  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  technical  support  facility  in  the  Regional  and \nSustainable  Development  Department  will  provide  parallel  technical  support  during  project \nimplementation to assist CDM-eligible subprojects in preparing project development documents \nand in identifying potential CER buyers, such as the Future Carbon Fund or the Asia Pacific \nCarbon Fund, to avail of CERs as extra revenue to their investments. Several European buyers \nhave contacted some subproject owners and are interested in purchasing their CERs. \n \n32.  Integration of the project into the government\u2019s stimulus package. In November \n2008, the government announced an economic stimulus package of CNY4 trillion, of which \nCNY3 billion is budgeted to boost the construction of biogas plants and train technicians to \nenhance  rural  and  livestock  sector  development.  Following  the  stimulus  package,  the \nparticipating provinces have included the project\u2019s subprojects in their priority list to receive \nadditional financial support from their respective packages. The project will (i) enhance the \n                                                 \n25 E. Ghafoori and P. Flynn. 2006. Optimum Sizing for Anaerobic Digestion.

Price contingencies were computed based on ADB-prescribed (international and \nnational) price escalation factors, and include provisions for potential foreign exchange rate fluctuations \nunder  the  assumption  of  a  purchasing  power  parity  exchange  rate.  Physical  contingencies  were \ncomputed at 5% for civil works and equipment for biogas plants. \nd   Include interest during construction computed at 5-year fixed swap rate, with a spread of 0.2%; and \ncommitment charges computed at 0.15% per year on undisbursed funds.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n34.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $66,080,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined following ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year on undisbursed funds, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan and project agreements. The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n  \n35.  In addition to the loan from ADB, the government has also requested GEF to provide \ngrant cofinancing of $9.2 million equivalent to finance the project activities. A grant agreement \nwill be entered into between the government and ADB on the implementation of the GEF-\nfinanced activities after the GEF Council\u2019s approval of the provision of the grant. The GEF grant \n ", "12  \nwill support the construction of the centralized biogas plants to demonstrate the feasibility of \ncommercial operations of the biogas plants and develop business models regarding the grid \nconnections for power generation at the biogas plants. The Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund \nunder the CEFPF will provide a grant of $3.0 million equivalent, of which up to $1.8 million will \nsubsidize the purchase of gas flares for selected subprojects to minimize the methane gas \nemissions during maintenance of the MLBGPs and emergency incidents. The objectives of the \nsubsidies for gas flares are to (i) demonstrate the global environmental benefits of the control of \nfugitive emission of methane gas, and (ii) encourage the government to gradually develop such \ntechnical requirement. The remaining funds of the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund grant will \nsupport the establishment of the best design and operational practices of MLBGPs and a \nperformance monitoring mechanism. German development cooperation through GTZ has also \nprovided a TA grant of $4.6 million equivalent to support the project management and capacity \ndevelopment activities of the project. The participating provincial governments will provide grant \nsupport of $10.78 million equivalent to the participating enterprises in the MLBGPs construction, \nand  in  project  implementation  and  capacity  development  activities.

The proceeds of the ADB loan will be made \navailable to the four participating provinces in the following respective amounts: Heilongjiang, \n$3.41 million; Henan, $22.0 million; Jiangxi, $20.0 million; and Shandong, $20.67 million. The \nterms and conditions of the loan proceeds made available to the participating provinces will be \nthe  same  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan,  with  the  participating  provinces  bearing  the  foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation risks of the portion of the ADB loan made available to each \nof them. The participating provinces will make the full amount of the loan proceeds respectively \nto the county and municipal finance bureaus at the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan, \nwith  the  concerned  county  and  municipal  governments  bearing  the  foreign  exchange  and \ninterest rate variation risks of the portion of the ADB loan made available to each of them. The \nconcerned  county  and  municipal  finance  bureaus  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  to  the \nenterprises  through  subloans,  and  such  subloan  will  be  made  in  local  currency  with  (i)  a \nrepayment period, including a grace period not exceeding those for the loan; (ii) commitment \ncharge identical to that of the loan; (iii) interest at a rate identical to that applied to the loan and, \nas applicable, an additional interest spread on the subloans not exceeding 0.2% to cover the \ncost of the delay in repayment and/or possible loss; and (iv) the beneficiary enterprises bearing \nall commitment and interest charges and foreign exchange variation risk associated with each \nsubloan. The beneficiary enterprises will repay the loan, interest, and commitment charges to \n ", "13 \nthe county and municipal finance bureaus for onward repayment to ADB, through the provincial \ngovernments  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  The  beneficiary  enterprises  will  bear  all \ninterest  charges  and  foreign  exchange  variation  risk  on  the  subloan.  The  onlending \narrangements and indicative funds flow are shown in Appendix 7. \n  \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n37.  MOA is the executing agency, and the departments of agriculture of the four participating \nprovinces are the implementing agencies. The project implementation arrangements are set out \nin  Appendix  8.  MOA  has  set  up  a  lead  group  comprising  senior  officials  from  MOA\u2019s \ndepartments of planning; and of science, education, and rural environment; and the Foreign \nEconomic Cooperation Center (FECC); MOF; and NDRC, which will provide policy guidance \nand support to project implementation. A project management office (PMO) has also been \nestablished in MOA, which will be responsible for overall project management, coordination, \ntraining, recruitment of consultants, and other implementation and monitoring activities. The \nPMO will be headed by a director appointed by the Department of Science, Education, and \nRural  Environment  of  MOA,  who  will  be  responsible  for  overall  guidance  on  project \nimplementation,  preparation  of  annual  workplans,  and  policy  coordination  with  relevant \ngovernment  agencies.  The  FECC  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  management \nactivities. The PMO will be supported by four professional staff from existing FECC staff. The \nPMO staff will be full-time employees. \n \n38.  Each implementing agency has set up a provincial lead group, comprising senior officials \nfrom the departments of agriculture, audit, environmental protection, and finance to guide in \nproject  implementation.  Depending  on  provincial  organization,  each  project  implementation \noffice (PIO) will be based in the Provincial Rural Energy Office or the Agricultural Foreign \nCapital Project Office within its provincial Department of Agriculture to manage and oversee the \nproject  implementation  activities.  Each  PIO  will  be  headed  by  a  senior  official  from  the \nimplementing agency as director and staffed with 7\u201310 trained and qualified technical, financial, \nand project management personnel. \n \n39.  Each concerned city or county government in the participating provinces will set up a \nleading group and establish a project implementation unit for field-level project activities. The \nunits will be located at the Bureau of Agriculture in the governments of the concerned cities and \ncounties and supported by the bureaus of finance and livestock, renewable energy offices, \npoverty alleviation offices, and other relevant technical agencies of the governments of the \nconcerned cities and counties. The units will work closely with the township governments and \nvillage  committees;  nongovernment  organizations,  such  as  women  associations;  research \ninstitutes; and universities. \n \n2.  Subproject Review and Approval Process \n40.  The  subproject  review  and  approval  process  is  in  Appendix  9.  Feasibility  studies, \nfinancial assessments, and environmental safeguard reports for 11 core subprojects have been \nprepared and reviewed with the support of the project preparatory TA consultants during loan \npreparation. Guidelines for technical specification and performance of MLBGPs were prepared \nto guide the design and operation of the subprojects (Supplementary Appendix B). The core \nsubprojects  will  proceed  with  implementation  in  the  initial  stages  of  the  project.  For  the \nremaining subprojects, preliminary feasibility studies and national environmental assessment \n ", "14  \nreports have been prepared following the subproject selection criteria (Appendix 10) to establish \nthe initial portfolio of candidate subprojects for the loan. \n  \n41.  Each  PIO  will  conduct  due  diligence  on  (i)  financial  and  economic  viability,  (ii) \ncompliance of the technical design with relevant standards, (iii) safeguard compliance, and (iv) \nprocurement plan and other implementation arrangements for subprojects. Each implementing \nagency will supervise the concerned PIO and finance bureaus of the concerned municipalities \nand counties in the selection and approval of the subloan applications following the subproject \nreview and approval process. \n  \n42.  For the subsequent review and approval of noncore subprojects, each PIO shall submit \nto ADB the feasibility study report and initial environmental examination (IEE) of the first one \nnoncore subproject in its province for review and approval prior to the execution of the subloan \nagreements and implementation of the selected subproject. Each implementing agency will \napprove, without ADB\u2019s prior review, the remaining subprojects in the respective province.26 \n  \n43.  Each  implementing  agency  will  also  be  responsible  for  obtaining  the  necessary \nclearances prior to starting the bidding process of each subproject, including environmental \nsafeguard clearance by the respective provincial environmental protection bureau (EPB). Each \nnoncore subproject will receive the same level of environmental safeguard review as described \nin the environmental assessment and review procedure (EARP) of the project\u2019s summary IEE. \nThe EARP complies with both the PRC and ADB regulatory and policy requirements. When \nADB and the PRC requirements differ, the more stringent will be applied. The concerned \nprovincial EPBs will approve the environmental assessment reports for the noncore subprojects. \nUpon approval, the reports will be posted on the local government\u2019s website or billboard and \nprovided to ADB for disclosure. \n  \n44.  Each participating province will cause the finance bureaus of the concerned municipality \nand county to maintain the records of reviewing, selecting, and approving the subloans for \nADB\u2019s  review.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  refuse  provision  of  funding  for  those  noncore \nsubprojects that fail to meet the subloan terms, subborrowers\u2019 and subprojects\u2019 eligibility criteria, \nand  national  technical  requirements,  in  which  case  the  finance  bureaus  of  the  concerned \nmunicipalities and counties will refund the proceeds of the loan to ADB. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n45.  The project will be implemented over a 6-year period from 2010 to 2015. The project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n  \n4.  Procurement \n46.  Following ADB procedures, an assessment was made of the procurement capacity of \nthe  executing  and  implementing  agencies  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The  assessment \nconcluded that Henan, Jiangxi, and Shandong PIOs had adequate procurement experience in \ndomestic- and ADB-financed projects. The executing agency and PIOs\u2019 staff in Heilongjiang \nprovince are experienced with domestic procedures but less experienced in ADB procurement \nprocedures. It is necessary to provide training to the executing and implementing agencies, with \nparticular support to Heilongjiang PIO, to ensure compliance with ADB procurement guidelines. \n                                                 \n26  The  project  completed  its  Management  Review  Meeting  on  4  June  2009.  Following  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), the project is subject to the application of ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Policy \non Indigenous Peoples (1998), and Environment Policy (2002).  \n ", "15 \nThe  executing  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  staff  attended  ADB-sponsored  training  on \nprocurement  and  project  implementation  during  project  preparation,  and  will  participate  in \nseminars  and  workshops  during  project  implementation  to  strengthen  their  procurement \ncapacity further. \n \n47.  All procurement of goods and works will be carried out following ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Each subborrower will engage the services of \na qualified tendering agency to carry out the procurement under the supervision and guidance \nof the respective PIO. Contracts for goods estimated to exceed $1 million and contracts for \nworks estimated to exceed $10 million will be procured using international competitive bidding \nprocedures. Contracts for goods estimated to cost more than $100,000 and for works estimated \nto cost more than $200,000, but less than the international competitive bidding values will be \nprocured through national competitive bidding procedures following the PRC\u2019s 1999 Tendering \nand Bidding Law subject to modifications agreed with ADB. Contracts for goods and works for \nindividual  subprojects  where  the  goods  are  estimated  to  cost  $1  million  or  less  and  the \ncombined cost of goods and works is equal to or below $10 million will be procured as turnkey \ncontracts using national competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods estimated to cost \n$100,000 or less, and for works estimated to cost $200,000 or less will be procured using \nshopping procedures. Works valued at $200,000 or less for the construction and upgrading of \nthe bio-digesters and eco-farming may be carried out through force account. In using force \naccount,  ADB  must  be  satisfied  that  the  government\u2019s  facilities  are  efficient,  and  that  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies are capable of undertaking the works on time and at the \nrequired quality at reasonable cost. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and  contracts.  A \nprocurement plan for the project is in Appendix 12. \n  \n5.  Consulting Services \n48.  An international consultant will be engaged by the PMO to support detailed design and \nto supervise activities, and selected PIOs will engage individual consultants to carry out specific \nactivities under the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund. Firms will be engaged by the PMO and \nPIOs to support the activities of GEF grants. The consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Multi-Donor \nClean Energy Fund-financed consultants will review the installation of high-temperature flares, \nconduct a survey on the performance of MLBGPs in the participating provinces, and develop \nand  implement  a  performance  monitoring  mechanism  for  MLBGPs.  The  GEF-financed \nconsultants  will  assist  in  capacity  development  and  project  management  for  the  design, \nconstruction, and operation of the centralized biogas plants, and special studies. The consulting \nfirms will be recruited through the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost \nratio of 80:20, using the simplified technical proposals following the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for Multi-Donor \nClean Energy Fund- and GEF-financed consulting services are in Appendix 13. In addition, \nGerman development cooperation through GTZ will finance and recruit consultants to assist in \nproject  implementation  management,  supervision  of  subproject  construction,  and  capacity \ndevelopment on MLBGP design and operation. GTZ will prepare the terms of reference for \nthese consulting services in consultation with ADB. \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n49.  The government has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for the \nprocurement  of  goods and  civil  works,  and  construction to  accelerate  project  start-up  and \n ", "16  \nfacilitate implementation of the subprojects. Many of the subproject livestock farms have been \nrequired to construct waste treatment facilities to comply with environmental requirements. \nThere are also seasonal constraints in construction activities in some project areas, such as in \nHeilongjiang and Henan provinces. The government\u2019s economic stimulus package has made \nfunds easily available for livestock farms to construct biogas plants; timely procurement would \nmake ADB financing more relevant to the farms\u2019 needs. Based on the conclusions of the \nprocurement  capacity  assessment  and  following  the  procurement  training  provided  to  the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  during  project  preparation,  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies have sufficient capacity to carry out the actions needed for advance \ncontracting. ADB has advised the government that retroactive financing can only apply to up to \n20% of the ADB loan with respect to expenditures incurred before effectiveness, but not earlier \nthan 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. All contracts for advance action will \nbe undertaken following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and the Procurement \nGuidelines. The government has been advised that approval of the advance contracting and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n7.  Anticorruption Policy  \n50.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the executing and implementing agencies. Consistent with its commitment \nto good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing and \nimplementing agencies, the PIOs, the PMO, all bio-digester beneficiaries, and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the project. The project \ndesign  and  implementation  arrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corruption  risks.  Risks \nassociated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated \nby (i) engaging consultants to advise and assist in the procurement of goods and services; (ii) \nintroducing a dual-signing system in which the civil works contractor awarded the contract will \nalso sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) periodical inspection by the PMO \nof the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. In furtherance of the \nprinciples of transparency and accountability, MOA will cause the PMO to set and develop a \nproject website that describes the project to provide the public with information on the project, \nincluding setting out (i) a summary of the audited financial statements of the project; and (ii) \ntracking of contract awards following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. MOA will ensure that the \nPMO  establishes  financial  control  and  management  arrangements  compatible  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects 27   and  the  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n51.  The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed following with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. To facilitate project implementation and adequacy of funds to meet the requirements \nof implementation, four imprest accounts for the loan (one for each participating province) will \nbe established by the respective provincial finance departments (PFDs) in commercial banks \nacceptable  to  ADB  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  managed  and \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "17 \nmonitored by the provinces. The initial advances to the imprest accounts will not exceed either \nthe projected expenditures covering the first 6 months of implementation or 10% of the loan \namount allocated to each province, whichever is lower. Disbursements from the provincial \nimprest  accounts  will  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  applications  and  required \ndocumentation. The direct payment procedures will apply for large contracts. If the government \ninitially funds eligible expenditures from its own resources, the reimbursement procedure will be \nused. To simplify the documentation requirements and expedite the disbursement process, the \nstatement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest \naccounts and reimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 per individual payment \nfrom beneficiary enterprises to suppliers or contractors under civil works and goods contracts. \nThe payments made in excess of the SOE ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished \nbased on the full supporting documentation process. The municipal and county finance bureaus \nwill disburse to beneficiary enterprises on a needs basis, which will be determined in relation to \nthe enterprises\u2019 approved workplans. The beneficiary enterprises, through the municipal and \ncounty finance bureaus, will be responsible for repayment to provincial governments. A financial \nmanagement  assessment  of  MOA  and  the  implementing  agencies  was  undertaken  during \nfeasibility study and concluded that they satisfy ADB\u2019s financial management requirements for \nthe executing and implementing agencies; and, as government offices in the hierarchy under \nMOF, they have satisfactory financial management capability. \n  \n52.  For the disbursement of the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund and GEF grants, a separate \nimprest account will be set up for the respective funds by MOF in a commercial bank acceptable \nto ADB upon grant effectiveness. Disbursement of funds by MOF to a beneficiary enterprise will \nbe made through one-time release or annual installments based on the enterprise\u2019s workplan, \nas approved by the concerned PIO and the PMO. The SOE procedure will be used to disburse \nfunds from the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund and GEF imprest accounts for expenditures not \nexceeding  $20,000  per  individual  payment.  Disbursements  exceeding  this  amount  will  be \nsupported by appropriate documentation. The initial amount to be deposited to the imprest \naccounts will not exceed the estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of implementation or \n10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. \n \n53.  Each province will, through its PFD, be responsible for management of the finances for \nthe part of the project in its own province. The proceeds of the loan will be released from the \nPFD  to  the  municipal  and/or  prefecture  and  county  finance  bureaus,  on  the  basis  of  the \nrecommendations of the PIOs, and in turn disbursed to the subborrowers. The disbursement, \nrepayment, and other financial activities will be channeled through the relevant finance bureaus \nand/or offices for the subprojects undertaken by the enterprise subborrowers. Each province \nwill, through its PFD, process loan withdrawal applications, following preparation by the PIO and \nupon certification by the PIO that the works or procurement have been carried out to an \nacceptable standard. Each province, through its PFD, will authorize the release of funds to the \ntownship finance offices, where they can be withdrawn by the subborrowers. The proceeds of \nthe loan advanced to the imprest accounts may be reimbursed under ADB\u2019s SOE procedure. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n54.  The PMO and PIOs will maintain records and accounts that identify goods and services \nfrom the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred, and use of local \nfunds. These accounts will be established and maintained following sound accounting principles \nand internationally accepted accounting standards. The PMO will review each PIO\u2019s accounts \nand consolidate them with the PMO accounts to produce the overall project accounts. The PMO \nand PIO accounts, as well as the overall accounts, will be audited annually following sound \n ", "18  \naccounting  practices  by  the  sovereign  audit  agency  of  the  government  or  other  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The audit reports will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds \ndisbursed by ADB were used for which they were provided, as well as the auditor\u2019s opinion on \nthe use of the imprest accounts and SOE procedures. Copies of the audited accounts and \nauditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial year. \nThe Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund and GEF accounts will be audited annually, and one \nconsolidated report for each fund covering the four participating provinces will be prepared and \nsubmitted to ADB for each year of implementation. \n \n55.  The PMO will prepare consolidated quarterly project reports indicating progress made, \nproblems encountered during the period, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the \nproposed program of activities, and progress expected for the next quarter. Based on the \nquarterly reports, the PMO will also prepare annual reports summarizing the progress made, \nproblems and remedies during the year, and the proposed workplan for the following year, \nincluding the planned activities of each PIO. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nproject, the PMO will submit to ADB a completion report that describes the achievements in \nrelation to the project\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n56.  To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the planned outcome and outputs, \nthe PMO will establish and maintain a project performance monitoring system (PPMS). The \nPPMS, which will be implemented by both the PMO and PIOs, will be designed to permit \nadequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedules, activities, and \ndevelopment impacts. The PPMS will include the following indicators but may be modified to \ninclude additional indicators identified during its detailed formulation: (i) physical progress of \nsubproject construction and implementation; (ii) physical progress of eco-farming and technical \nservices support; (iii) results of capacity development programs; (iv) operational efficiency of \nMLBGPs, including generation and utilization of biogas; (v) environmental improvements in \nsubproject areas; (vi) uses of biogas; and (vii) household income. At project inception, the PMO \nwill prepare comprehensive PPMS procedures to systematically generate data on inputs and \noutputs  of  the  project  activities;  and  a  set  of  socioeconomic,  health,  and  environmental \nindicators to measure project impacts. The socioeconomic monitoring will be based on sex-\ndisaggregated data and gender indicators, such as women\u2019s employment and training. \n \n57.  With the assistance of the project implementation consultants, the PMO will refine the \nPPMS framework; confirm achievable targets, monitoring and recording arrangements; and \nestablish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after project implementation begins. \nBaseline and progress data will be collected by the PIOs; and consolidated and reported at the \nrequisite  time  intervals  by  the  PMO,  including  annual  reporting  on  the  environmental \nmanagement plan. The PMO will be responsible for consolidating and analyzing the PIOs\u2019 data \nthrough its management information system, and reporting outcomes to ADB through quarterly \nprogress reports. The PMO will also prepare a dissemination plan to systematically share the \nknowledge and experience gained from the project with nonparticipating provinces and national \nstakeholders. The executing agency will also organize an international conference on PRC's \nbiomass energy development to share its knowledge and experience with developing countries \nin  the  region.  The  dissemination  plan  will  include  activities  such  as  website  postings, \nworkshops, conferences, and publications. \n \n \n \n ", "19 \n11.  Project Review \n58.  In addition to regular monitoring, project performance will be reviewed at least once a \nyear  jointly  by  ADB  and  the  executing  agency.  The  review  will  assess  implementation \nperformance  and  achievement  of  progress  toward  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  financial \nprogress, and issues and constraints affecting implementation; and work out a time-bound \naction plan for their resolution. ADB and the executing agency will undertake a midterm review \nto assess implementation status and take appropriate measures, including modification of scope \nand implementation arrangements; and reallocation of loan proceeds, as appropriate, to achieve \nthe project\u2019s impact and outcome. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n59.  The project will directly benefit about 118 large livestock farms and agro-enterprises \nthrough the construction and operation of biogas plants. In addition, surrounding communities \nand farmers will benefit from improved health conditions and environmental quality, increased \nemployment opportunities during the construction and operation of the biogas plants, as well as \nincreased business opportunities for contract breeding and eco-farming. In addition, GEF will \ncofinance 10 out of the 118 subprojects to establish centralized MLBGPs, each of which will \nbenefit neighboring livestock farms by avoiding investment in waste treatment facilities, while \nmeeting solid waste treatment requirements. \n \n60.  Financial analysis of MLBGPs. Financial analysis was undertaken to (i) evaluate the \nfinancial  management  capacity  of  the  core  subproject  enterprises,  including  their  financial \nsituation; (ii) assess their capacity to finance the counterpart contributions during construction; \n(iii) assess loan repayment capacity; and (iv) analyze the financial viability of the investment \nwith and without payment for CERs. The financial management capacity of the core subprojects \nwas assessed and found to be acceptable based on the financial management assessment \nquestionnaire. However, enterprise staff lack experience with ADB-financed projects and will \nrequire training to ensure success. The counterpart contributions come from both government \ngrants and enterprises. The capacity to finance counterpart contributions was assessed by \nexamining the governments\u2019 fiscal revenues and enterprises\u2019 annual profit levels. The analysis \nindicated  that  both  governments  and  enterprises  have  sufficient  capacity  to  finance  the \ncounterpart  contributions.  For  loan  repayment  capacity,  the  analysis  indicated  that  all \nenterprises can be expected to generate sufficient income from biogas and/or electricity, sale of \norganic fertilizers, and carbon credits to repay the subloans. Based on a weighted average cost \nof capital (WACC) of 5.2%, all core subprojects are financially viable with the financial internal \nrates of return (FIRRs) greater than the WACC. The FIRRs of these subprojects range from \n6.0% to 11.3%. If income from the sale of CERs is included, the FIRRs are increased, ranging \nfrom 8.3% to 16.8% and indicating the value to be derived from the CDM. \n  \n61.  Economic  benefits.  In  the  economic  analysis,  the  environmental  benefits  were \nassumed to be reflected by the economic value of the CERs; and these benefits were assumed \nto be generated for the full project life. In addition to the CERs, the main economic benefits \nincluded energy savings from the use of biogas, and electricity and fertilizer savings from the \nuse  of  biogas  slurry  and  organic  fertilizer.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  and \neconomic net present values (ENPVs) were estimated using a discount rate of 12%. All core \nsubprojects have EIRRs in excess of 12% and positive ENPVs. The EIRRs range from 12.2% to \n23.6%. The analysis of the distribution of benefits indicates that households and farmers in the \n ", "20  \nproject  area  will  receive  substantial  benefits.  The  financial  and  economic  analyses  are \nsummarized in Appendix 14. Details of the financial and economic analyses of core subprojects \nare in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n62.  Social benefits and impacts. Among the subprojects, 22 are located in national poverty \ncounties, accounting for 14.3% of total subprojects; and 44 are in provincial poverty counties, \naccounting for 29% of total subprojects. The project will directly benefit farmers, including poor \nhouseholds, in three ways: (i) about 4,900 temporary jobs will be created at biogas plants during \nconstruction, increasing people\u2019s incomes by CNY4,000 on average over of 3\u20134 months; and \nabout 1,400 new jobs will be generated during biogas plant operation, with per capita incomes \nof about CNY13,000; (ii) about 9,000 poor households will use the organic fertilizers from the \nbiogas  plants,  benefiting  from  enhanced  productivity,  savings  on  chemical  fertilizers,  and \nincremental revenues from the sales of organic products; and (iii) about 27,000 contract farmers \nwill benefit from the sales of livestock to participating enterprises. Each contract farmer\u2019s annual \nhousehold income will total CNY44,200, which is considerably higher than the average income \nof CNY19,067 in the project area. There are also many indirect benefits. The project will provide \nclean energy to about 41,000 households and improve their energy consumption by replacing \nstraw, wood, or coal, which will protect the environment. Some enterprises plan to supply low-\npriced  electricity  to  neighboring  villagers.  About  1,500  poor  households  will  benefit  from \nimproved access to cheaper electricity. It is estimated that about 65,200 households, including \n4,500 poor households, will benefit from improved environmental and health conditions. There \nare tangible benefits for the poor, such as new employment opportunities and increased income \nopportunities through expanded contract farming and eco-farming. Women will generally and \nequally benefit from the project\u2019s positive impacts on livelihoods. A specific gender impact will \nbe the reduction of time and workload for fuel and firewood collection by women because of the \nincreased  use  of  biogas  in  households.  Women\u2019s  health  condition  will  also  be  improved \nsignificantly due to the improvement of indoor air quality subsequent to the replacement of fuel \nand firewood by cleaner gas fuel. In addition, the project will give training priority to women to \nhelp improve their agricultural skills, and generate job opportunities for women in construction \nand operation of biogas plants at agro-enterprises. The project will also involve women in \nraising community awareness of environmental pollution and health issues. \n  \n63.  All subprojects will take place within the existing land owned by the agro-enterprises. \nHence, no land acquisition and resettlement is required. No subproject is located in a minority \nautonomous area, and no ethnic minorities were identified in the subproject sites. Therefore, no \nrisks are envisaged to indigenous people. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 15. The details of social and poverty analysis are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n64.  Environmental benefits and impacts. The project is categorized environment B. The \nIEEs of the five core subprojects were reviewed by ADB, and a summary IEE was prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix F). The project is expected to produce environmental benefits. Each \nyear, the project will treat about 7.0 million tons of livestock and agroprocessing waste; and \nproduce about 70 million m3 of biogas, which can be used for electricity, cooking, and heating; \nand replace fossil fuel or firewood. The subprojects will also produce about 5.09 million tons of \norganic fertilizers for eco-farming each year to help sequestrate carbon in the soil humus and \nimprove soil fertility. The project is estimated to result in an annual GHG reduction of 1 million \ntons of CO  equivalent because of the reduction of methane emissions from livestock farms and \n2\nreplacement of fossil fuel by methane gas. \n  \n65.  Only minor construction and operational impacts are expected, which are temporary and \nlocalized  and  can  be  mitigated  or  prevented  to  acceptable  levels  by  applying  adequate \n ", "21 \nconstruction  and  maintenance  practices.  Mitigation  measures,  institutional  arrangements, \nenvironmental monitoring and management mechanisms, capacity development, and public \nconsultations have been proposed. The adverse environmental impacts are assessed to be \ninsignificant, and an environmental impact assessment is not suggested. The environmental \nanalysis is in Appendix 16. \n  \nB.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n66.  The  participating  provincial  and  county  governments,  livestock  farms,  and  agro-\nenterprises  will  share  the  repayment  risk.  The  local  governments  have  guaranteed  the \nrepayment of disbursed loan funds. In case of repayment default, the provincial governments \nagree that MOF deduct amounts due from the public budgets of the county governments. The \nfinancial risk associated with lending to the participating livestock farms and agro-enterprises \nhas been substantially mitigated through the stringent selection of subborrowers. The historic \nand future financial management assessments and other due diligence reviews complement \nrisk mitigation efforts. Market and demand analyses were conducted, and all the subborrowers \nwere found to have well-established markets. \n \n67.  The project does not have any unusual technical risks, which minimizes the risk of \nunforeseen construction conditions. The following potential market and institutional risks could \naffect the performance and the expected benefits of the project, including (i) epidemic animal \ndisease prevalence, destroying livestock or agro-industry market; (ii) downturn of livestock or \nagro-industry  market;  (iii)  subborrowers\u2019  lack  of  resources  for  and  appropriate  capacity  of \noperating and maintaining the biogas plants; (iv) subborrowers\u2019 lack of interest in participating in \ncapacity development training; (v) limited demand for biogas and organic fertilizers; and (vi) the \ngovernment\u2019s failure to provide timely and sufficient counterpart funds. \n \n68.  Mitigation measures have been taken or designed to minimize the institutional and \nfinancial risks: (i) stringent selection of the subborrowers via thorough assessments and due \ndiligence reviews of each subborrower\u2019s historic and future financial management capacity; \n(ii) extensive market and demand analyses; (iii) continuous policy dialogue with the government \non the improvement of the performance of the subsector during project implementation; and (iv) \ncovenanted assurance requesting the participating provincial governments to provide timely and \nsufficient counterpart funds. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n69.  Specific  assurances.  In  addition  to  standard  assurances,  the  government,  the \nexecuting agency, and the implementing agencies have given the following assurances, which \nhave been incorporated into the loan and project agreements. \n \n(i)  Counterpart  financing.  The  government  will  cause  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies to ensure that (a) all domestic financing necessary for the \nproject be timely provided, and (b) additional counterpart financing be provided in \nthe event of any shortfall of funds or cost overruns to complete the project.  \n(ii)  Land acquisition and resettlement. Each implementing agency will ensure that \n(a) no land acquisition be required for any subproject, and (b) no resettlement be \nrequired for any subproject. \n(iii)  Environment. Each implementing agency will ensure that the project facilities \nare constructed, maintained, and operated in strict conformity to (a) all applicable \nnational  and  local  government  technical  guidelines,  environmental  laws, \n ", "22  \nregulations,  and  procedures;  (b)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nguidelines; and (c) the environmental mitigation and monitoring measures set out \nin the respective environmental assessment reports. In case that any subproject \nis cited for a violation of any law, regulation, standard, or ordinance related to \nenvironmental  protection  within  the  reporting  period,  a  certification  from  the \nenvironmental authorities concerned will be included in the reports showing that \nthe violation has been corrected or a corrective action plan has been accepted or \napproved. \n(iv)  Environmental  review  of  noncore  subprojects.  The executing agency will \nensure  that  all  implementing  agencies  will  apply  environmental  safeguard \nscreening  procedures  of  noncore  subprojects  in  compliance  with  the  EARP, \nwhich  requires  adequate  consultations  and  the  establishment  of  an \nenvironmental management plan for each subproject. \n(v)  Project  performance  management  system.  Within  12  months  of  the  loan \neffective date, the executing agency and each implementing agency will establish \na suitably staffed PPMS unit within the PMO and PIOs. Each will monitor and \nevaluate project impacts and effects through the PPMS to ensure that the project \nfacilities are managed effectively and the benefits are maximized. Each province \nwill cause the concerned PIOs to conduct routine results monitoring evaluations \nand socioeconomic surveys; and transmit the results to PMO, which will in turn \nconsolidate and report the results to ADB, GEF, and MOF together with the \nsemiannual progress reports. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n70.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n(i)  the loan of $66,080,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Integrated \nRenewable Biomass Energy Development Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  following  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially following with those set forth in the loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board; \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Integrated Renewable Biomass Energy \nDevelopment Sector Project to be provided by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy \nFund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility; and  \n(iii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $9,200,000 \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Integrated Renewable Biomass Energy \nDevelopment Sector Project to be provided by the Global Environment Facility.  \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda  \nPresident \n__ March 2010 \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  23 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and/or  Data Sources and/or \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2020,  Government\u2019s policy or  Assumptions  \nImproved rural  strategy on MLBGPs  Environmental standards \nAbout 10,000 large-scale biogas \nenvironmental  are enforced. \nplants on livestock farms are  Provincial statistics in \nmanagement and \nconstructed and operated  Heilongjiang, Henan,   The government\u2019s policy on \naccess to biogas \nefficiently.

The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is at a crucial stage in its social and economic \ndevelopment. With increasing industrialization and improving living standards, the PRC\u2019s overall \ndemand  for  energy  is  growing  rapidly,  placing  severe  problems  on  energy  supply  and \nenvironmental protection. Rural energy consumption is increasing at a rate of 2.6% annually. \nLivestock  breeding  and  agro-industries  in  the  PRC  have  been  developing  rapidly  and  are \ngradually changing from scattered small farms into professional medium-sized and large farms. \nThe organic waste produced from livestock production and agroprocessing are also increasing \nsignificantly, resulting in serious environmental pollution and public health problems. Because of \nthe  high  concentration  of  organic  materials  in  the  livestock  and  agroprocessing  waste, \nanaerobic  digestion  technology  is  one  of  the  most  effective  ways  to  solve  such  pollution \nproblems, which could also convert the biomass waste into biogas to relieve energy shortage in \nrural areas. \n  \n2.  Government policies and programs. The PRC has millions of small-scale biogas units \nin rural areas. With the fast growth of medium-sized and large livestock farms, the government \nhas  shifted  its  focus  of  biogas  development  to  medium-  and  large-scale  biogas  plants \n(MLBGPs) to address the environmental pollution and energy problems in rural areas. The \ngovernment\u2019s policies and regulations on the development of MLBGPs are comprehensive\u2014\ncovering renewable energy development,1 rural energy development,2 rural biogas plants,3 \npollution  abatement,4  climate  protection,5  enterprise  income  tax  laws,  and  the  \u201ccircular \neconomy.\u201d6 The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has been providing budgetary support to the \ndevelopment of biogas plants, starting from an average of CNY30 million\u2013CNY40 million in early \nyears  to  CNY180  million  in  2008.  The  government\u2019s  2008  stimulus  package  provided \nCNY3 billion  to  subsidize  the  construction  of  biogas  plants  and  training  of  engineers  and \ntechnicians. \n  \n3.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law  of  2006  encourages  and  supports  renewable  energy \nutilization, including the biogas system; and sets a goal of 24 billion cubic meters (m3) of biogas \nproduction  by  2020  from  various  sources,  including  waste  from  livestock  farms  and \nagroprocessing plants. The law also encourages biogas producers to generate power from \nbiogas and sell extra electricity to local power grids. According to the Pilot Rules on Tariff and \nCost Sharing of Renewable Energy Power Generation of 2006, the electricity sales by biogas \nplants could receive an extra CNY0.25 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) on top of the provincial grid feed-\nin electricity price from coal power plants. \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). 2007. \nMedium- and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy in China.

The Circular Economy Law, which became effective on 1 January 2009, regulates, \namong  others,  waste  reduction,  reuse,  and  recycling  during  agricultural  production, \ntransportation, and consumption. The objectives of the law are to promote waste recycling, \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  resources  utilization,  protect  the  environment,  and  facilitate  an \neconomic growth pattern of zero-discharge. Eco-farming is one of the measures identified in the \nlaw to strengthen the \u201ccircular economy,\u201d including recycling the sludge from biogas plants and \nreusing it on farms to save the use of chemical fertilizers and help rehabilitate soil quality and \nimprove crop quality. \n  \n5.  Provincial policies and institutional arrangements. In the participating provinces,7 \nbiomass energy development is one of the key priority topics in their respective 11th five-year \ndevelopment  plans  (2006\u20132010).  Each  province  has  formulated  its  own  rural  energy \ndevelopment plan, in which targets are set for the construction of MLBGPs and establishment of \nextension services. Each province also has rural energy offices in the provinces and counties to \nimplement its rural energy development plan. Henan and Jiangxi provinces also have provincial \nrural environmental improvement plans, which promote biogas and eco-farming development as \npart of the \u201ccircular economy\u201d activities. While the provinces have rural energy offices in the \nprovinces  and  counties,  the  existing  extension  services  can  provide  only  limited  technical \nsupport and services in MLBGP design and operation because of their limited number in rural \nareas.  Furthermore,  most  of  the  engineers  and  technicians  obtain  their  experience  from \nindustrial wastewater treatment processes and do not have sufficient knowledge of the design \nand operation of biogas power plants. The weakness in providing qualified technical services \nresults in a bottleneck to the development of biogas projects and may lead to poor maintenance \nand performance of biogas plants. \n  \nB.  Livestock and Agro-Industrial Waste Management   \n1.  Development of Livestock Industry and Waste Management \n6.  The development of the livestock industry is entering a new stage where commercial \nproduction is rapidly replacing traditional backyard production to meet the increasing demand \nfor livestock products, such as pork, beef, and lamb; and more recently, dairy products.8 The \nnumber of large commercialized livestock farms has been increasing steadily, and the critical \nissue of the management of the large volume of livestock waste has emerged. These livestock \nwastes have been largely untreated or only partially treated and have polluted the surrounding \nsoil, water, and air environment. \n  \n7.  The number of commercialized livestock farms9 in the PRC has increased from about \n2.4 million in 2002 to 4.3 million in 2007, out of which more than 19,740 were medium-sized and \nlarge  livestock  farms.10  However,  only  8,576  of  these  farms,  including  1,646  large  and \n                                                 \n7  The participating provinces are Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangxi, and Shandong provinces. \n8  Ma, H.; Rae, A.; Huang, J.; and Rozelle, S. 2004. Chinese Agriculture Product Consumption in the late 1990s, The \nAustralian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 44:4, pp. 569\u2013590; Gale, F. and Huang, K. 2007. \nDemand for Food Quantity and Quality in China, Economic Research Report No. 32, Economic Research Service, \nUSDA. \n9  Commercialized livestock farms are defined as those with an annual slaughter of over 50 pigs, 2,000 broilers, or 10 \nbeef cattle, or an annual inventory of more than 500 layers or 5 dairy cattle. Large livestock farms are defined as \nthose with an annual slaughter of more than 3,000 pigs, 100,000 broilers, or 500 beef cattle, or an annual inventory \nof more than 50,000 layers or 200 dairy cattle. \n10  Medium-sized  livestock  farms  are  those  with  an  annual  slaughter  of  3,000\u201310,000  pigs,  or                           \n100,000\u2013400,000  broilers,  or  500\u20131,200  beef  cattle;  or  an  annual  inventory  of  50,000\u2013200,000  layers  or            \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n6,930 medium-sized farms, or about 43%, were equipped with waste treatment facilities. The \nfast-growing number of medium-sized and large livestock farms has raised national concern \nover  environmental  issues  associated  with  livestock  waste.  According  to  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental Protection (MEP), total animal waste exceeded 2.7 billion tons in 2006, which \nwas 3.4 times that of industrial solid waste. The waste volume is expected to increase as the \ncountry becomes the world\u2019s top meat and egg producer and tries to address the shortage of \ndairy products. It has been estimated that livestock waste will reach about 5.21 billion tons by \n2010, and about 6.76 billion tons by 2020.11 \n \n2.  Development of Agro-Industry and Waste Management \n8.  The number of agro-enterprises in the PRC has been growing rapidly in recent years in \nline with the development of the economy and the growing urban market. There were over \n16,000  agro-enterprises  in  2005,  and  each  enterprise  produced  an  average  output  of \nCNY79 million.  It  was  estimated  that  the  amount  of  agro-industrial  waste  was  more  than \n51 million tons in 2006, which did not include waste from meat, vegetable, and fruit processing \nindustries.12 The agro-industrial wastewater is usually high in organic content, which can be \ntreated efficiently by anaerobic digestion. The biogas generated can be used as an alternative \nenergy by the industry itself, the sludge produced can be used as organic fertilizer, and the \ntreated wastewater can be reused for irrigation or discharged into natural water bodies. \n  \n3.  Livestock  and  Agro-Industry  Development  and  Waste  Management  in \nParticipating Provinces  \n9.  The four participating provinces are nationally important agricultural provinces and yield \nmore than 30% of the national livestock and agroproduction output. According to the respective \n11th five-year development plans (2006\u20132010), the planned annual growth rates for livestock \nproducts range from 1.5% to 22.7% over 2006\u20132010. The livestock densities in these provinces \nare almost triple the national average. The commercialized livestock farms in these provinces \nincreased from about 1.0 million in 2002 to 1.2 million in 2006, which accounted for more than \n28% of the commercialized livestock farms in the PRC. Such growth trends continued in 2007. \nThe MLBGPs in these provinces reached 1,732 in 2007, which is about 20% of the nation\u2019s \ntotal.13 \n  \n10.  The pollution contribution of livestock farms in these provinces varies, accounting for \nmore than 60% of the total pollution on average. More than 95% of the livestock waste is \ndischarged without treatment. Geographically, these provinces represent different climate zones \nwhere the design, operation, and maintenance of biogas plants need different considerations. \nThey range from colder Heilongjiang province in the north to the warmer subtropical Jiangxi \nprovince  in  the  south.  The  geographic  differences  of  these  provinces  give  the  project  an \nopportunity to demonstrate the best design and operational practices of MLBGPs in different \nclimate conditions, which is critical to the replication success of the operations of MLBGPs in \ndifferent regions of the PRC. \n                                                                                                                                                          \n200\u2013600 dairy cattle. Large livestock farms are those with animals more than the upper thresholds of the medium-\nsized farms. \n11 ADB. 2009. Preparing the Integrated Renewable Biomass Energy Development Project.

Livestock and Agro-Industrial Waste Treatment Technology and Models \n11.  The government has been promoting the following two models of biogas plants for \nlivestock and agro-industrial waste management: (i) the \u201cenergy-ecological type\u201d of biogas plant, \ncapable of treating organic waste of high concentration and converting the waste into biogas for \nenergy uses, and the slurry and sludge from the biogas plant for use on farmlands, feed for fish \nponds, and fertilizer; and (ii) the \u201cenergy-environmental type\u201d of biogas plant, which treats the \neffluent by aerobic and physical-chemical treatments to meet national emission liquid discharge \nstandards. 14 Up to 2006, about 4,000 MLBGPs were developed on livestock farms in the PRC; \nand this number was increased to 8,576 in 2007 (Table A2.1). In 2005, MLBGPs supplied about \n138.37 million m3 of biogas to local households, and generated 40 million kWh of power. In the \n2007  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Development  Plan  for  Renewable  Energy  in  China  of  the \nNational Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the government expects that by 2020, \nabout 10,000 biogas plants will be established by the large livestock farms; and about 6,000 \nbiogas plants by the industrial organic wastewater treatment plants, with a biogas yield of about \n14 billion m3 (footnote 1). \n \nTable A2.1: Number of Medium- and Large-Scale Biogas Plants in the PRC  \nBiogas  Power \nSupply to  Generation \nNumber of  Waste Treated Biogas Yield Households  (million kWh)\n   Year  Projects  (million tons)  (million m3)  (million m3)  \n2003  2,355  58.01  183.92  \u2014  \u2014 \n2004  2,671  71.90  176.19  \u2014  \u2014 \n2005  3,764  122.82  341.14  138.37  40 \n2006  4,000  130.00  362.50  \u2014  \u2014 \n2007  8,576a  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n2020  10,000b  \u2014  1,000.00  \u2014  \u2014 \n\u2014 = data not available, ADB = Asian Development Bank, kWh = kilowatt-hour, m3 = cubic meter, \nNDRC = National Development and Reform Commission, PRC = People's Republic of China, TA = \ntechnical assistance. \na Including 1,646 large-scale and 6,930 medium-scale biogas plants. \nb NDRC\u2019s planning figure for large-scale biogas plants at livestock farms.  \nSource: ADB. 2009.

These include a \nmaximum of 150 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of biochemical oxygen demand, 400 mg/l of chemical \noxygen demand, 200 mg/l of suspended solids, 80 mg/l of ammonia-nitrogen, 80 mg/l of total \nphosphorus, 1,000 feces coliform per 1,000 milliliters, and 2 ascarid ovum per liter. For the \nenergy-ecological type of biogas plants, the effluent to be used for eco-farming will meet the \nstandards of feces coliform and ascarid ovum. \n  \n13.  MOA issued design criteria for biogas plants in large livestock farms in 2006, which \nfocus mainly on engineering design factors and fire safety aspects. The criteria fall behind some \nadvanced countries\u2019 standards, such as the European Union, which require the consideration of \nbiogas production efficiency, greenhouse gas emission reduction, power generation, and high \noperational performance. \n                                                 \n14 China National Standard. 2006.

It is estimated that about 5.09 million tons of organic fertilizers are produced each year \nfrom biogas plants and used in eco-farming. The use of organic fertilizers in eco-farming helps \nprotect groundwater and surface water from contamination by chemical fertilizers, improves soil \nquality, increases productivity and quality, saves mineral fertilizers and pesticides, and fosters \nfood  safety.  Livestock  farms  usually  provide  raw  waste,  such  as  dung  and  slurry,  free  to \nneighboring farmers for farming purposes. However, processed livestock waste can be sold in \nthe market for as high as CNY600 per ton (footnote 11). \n  \n15.  By the end of 2006, the number of \u201cgreen\u201d food enterprises reached about 4,615, which \nproduced about 72 million tons of products and annual sales of about CNY150 billion. The price \nof eco-farming produce is usually higher than ordinary produce, which provides an opportunity \nfor farmers to improve productivity, increase household income, and improve livelihood quality. \nThe definition of eco-farming in the PRC remains descriptive and lacks strict standards. The \nmain  principles  are  (i)  chemical  fertilizer  input  is  below  225  kilogram  per  hectare  (kg/ha); \n(ii) pesticides are reduced by more than 40% compared with average application; (iii) nitrogen \nfertilizer input is reduced by more than 30%, i.e., nitrogen use for crops drops to 180 kg/ha, and \nfor vegetables to 600 kg/ha; and use of phosphorus fertilizer is less than 300 kg/ha; and (iv) \norganic fertilizer accounts for at least two-thirds of total fertilizer applied. \n \n16.  Table A2.2 shows the growth trend of eco-farming in the participating provinces. Eco-\nfarming development in the participating provinces has experienced significant growth during \n2000\u20132006. Average annual growth has registered 65.5% for the cultivated area, 103.0% for \noutput value, and 122.0% for certified enterprises.  \n \nTable A2.2: Development Trend of Eco-Farming in the Project Area \nCultivated Area  Output  Output Value Certified  Certified \nProvince  Year  (hectare)  (ton)  (CNY million)  Enterprises   Products  \nHeilongjiang  2000  800,000  1,905,000  12,400  93  228 \n  2006  3,120,000  7,430,000  52,500  425  1054 \nHenan  2000  26,700  80,000  400  33  33 \n  2006  488,000  14,550,000a  10,650  230  527 \nJiangxi  2000  38,100  240,000a  1,200  36  38 \n  2006  342,000  2,200,000a  10,800  230  751 \nShandong  2000  120,000  220,000  1,450  69  136 \n  2006  1,033,000  10,700,000  21,030  1,093  2,188 \nTotal  2000  1,091,800  3,645,000  17,450  321  582 \n  2006  5,383,000  39,680,000  124,980  2,674  10,504 \nAverage growth \n  65.5  165.0  103.0  122.0  284.0 \nrate (%) \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CNY = yuan, PRC = People's Republic of China, TA = technical assistance. \na  Represents the estimated or adjusted data. \nSource: ADB. 2009.

Anaerobic  digestion  is  a  mature  technology  that  has  been  widely  adopted  to  treat \nwastewater that contains a high concentration of organic materials from households, livestock \nfarms,  and  agro-industries.

Multilateral  and  bilateral  organizations  have  been  assisting  the  Government  of  the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  to  develop  and  implement  its  strategies  on  renewable \nbiomass energy development. Since the early 1990s, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nbeen  assisting  the  government  in  building  up  capacity  for  environmental  management, \nenvironmental  legislation,  nonpoint  source  pollution  control,  and  rural  biomass  energy \ndevelopment. ADB has provided technical assistance (TA) and loan projects related to policy \nstudies, demonstration, and infrastructure development of biogas technology and eco-farming, \nincluding the preparation of the Ministry of Agriculture\u2019s National Strategy for Rural Biomass \nRenewable Energy Development.1 ADB has also provided TA and loan projects to Heilongjiang, \nHenan, and Shandong provinces to solve water pollution problems, including nonpoint source \npollution,  in  major  watersheds  and  wetlands.  The  project  would  continue  ADB\u2019s  efforts  in \nhelping these provinces reduce nonpoint source pollution effectively. The ongoing ADB loan for \nthe Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project supports four provinces in constructing \nhousehold bio-digesters; using biogas for cooking, heating, and lighting; and applying bio-\nsludge in eco-farming to improve rural livelihoods.2  \n \n2.  The World Bank\u2019s support to the sector has focused mainly on the development of \nhousehold  bio-digesters  and  eco-farming  systems.  The  governments  of  Australia  and  the \nNetherlands,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  and  the  Food  and  Agriculture \nOrganization  have  supported  capacity  development  activities,  piloted  commercialization  of \nrenewable energy projects, and constructed pilot biogas plants to solve livestock waste and \nrural energy problems in Gansu and Jiangsu provinces. The government is also a partner in the \nMethane to Markets Partnership, which helped shape the PRC\u2019s 2005 Renewable Energy Law. \nMajor projects supported by external assistance are summarized in Table A4. \n \nTable A4: Major Development Partners \n \nSector and  Development  Amount \nThemes  Partner  Project Name  Year  ($ million) \nMultisector  ADB  Legislative Reform for Protecting Environment  1994   0.50  \nand Natural Resources \nEnvironmental    Rural Energy Development Study  1994  0.50 \nSustainability    Study of Control and Management of Rural  2002  0.60 \nNonpoint Source Pollution \nEconomic    Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project  2002  33.12 \nGrowth    Renewable Energy for Poverty Reduction  2003  0.60 \n    Gansu Clean Energy Development Project  2003   35.00 \n    Support for Environmental Legislation  2004  0.40 \n         \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \n3.  The government coordinates all external assistance from development partners through \nthe National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and through ministries appointed \nas \"window agencies\" to work with each organization. The Ministry of Finance serves ADB and \nthe  World  Bank.  The  NDRC  and  window  agencies  work  together  to  ensure  that  external \nassistance supports the 11th Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010 serves the PRC's needs, and suits the \ninterests and expertise of each organization. \n \n4.  ADB  has  been  supporting  the  government  in  organizing  several  international \nconferences on policy and strategies on biomass renewable energy development, which serve \nas platforms for ADB and the government to coordinate donors' efforts and share knowledge \nand  experience  with  development  partners  and  developing  countries.  During  project \npreparation, the project team consulted major international development partners working in the \n ", "36  Appendix 4  \nsector, including GTZ, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World Bank. \nKey lessons from past agriculture and natural resource programs of ADB and related evaluation \nreports, and other donors' relevant programs have been incorporated in the project design.  \n \nC.  Achievements and Issues  \n5.  All  the  international  development  partners  working  in  the  PRC  support  the  Paris \nDeclaration and are committed to aligning their work with the government's development plan. \nThe  strategies  and  operations  are  similar  across  organizations  because  of  the  common \nalignment with the 11th Five-Year Plan, and because all organizations recognize the same \nchallenges facing the country. The regional focus of these organizations is clearly aligned with \nthe government's 11th Five-Year Plan. Most organizations focus on the western provinces, with \na few concentrating on the central and northeastern ones.   \n \n6.  Through  coordination,  ADB  and  other  development  partners  are  able  to  improve \ndevelopment  synergies  by  introducing  and  scaling  up  new  technology,  knowledge,  and \nmanagement experience. ADB has also successfully mobilized concessional funds from some \ndevelopment partners such as the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and the Global \nEnvironment Facility, in introducing capacity development and other innovations in the projects. \nEfforts are still needed to integrate external and domestic funding sources to maximize the \neffectiveness and efficacy of rural biomass renewable energy development.   \n \nD.  Recommendations  \n7.  Anaerobic  digestion  is  a  mature  technology  that  has  been  adopted  widely  for  the \ntreatment  of  wastewater  with  higher  concentration  of  organic  materials  from  households, \nlivestock farms, and agro-industries. The owners and operators of the medium- and large-scale \nbiogas plants (MLBGPs) in the PRC still need to improve their knowledge of the design and \noperational  procedures  to  maximize  the  environmental  and  energy  benefits  of  MLBGPs. \nFurthermore, the treatment of livestock and agroprocessing waste using anaerobic digestion \ncould be eligible for the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) financing since it can generate \ncertified emission reductions. However, up to 2008, only four out of 1,630 CDM projects in the \nPRC were livestock CDM projects.3 ADB and other international development partners may \nneed to continue their support in assisting the subsector in pursuing carbon financing to improve \nthe sustainability of the development of MLBGPs. \n \n \n                                                 \n3  Fei Xie. 2008.

Introduction \n1.  Financial and economic analyses were undertaken for each core subproject.1 The core \nsubprojects represent the range of physical, social, and economic conditions of the candidate \nsubprojects. Smaller subprojects were included in the initially selected core subprojects, but \nwithdrew for various reasons. Rapid analysis conducted on some smaller subprojects during \nloan processing indicated that they are financially and economically viable. A summary of the \nanalyses is presented below, together with the results. The overall goal of the proposed project \nis to develop a market environment for anaerobic digesters as a cost-effective way of treating \nlivestock manure in large and medium-sized livestock farms as well as the waste of agro-\nenterprises, so as to reduce rural point and nonpoint source pollution problems and rural energy \ngaps.  The  project  will  also  support  strengthening  of  institutional  capacity  to  improve  the \nsustainability of medium- and large-scale biogas plants (MLBGPs), promotion of centralized \nMLBGPs for treatment of waste from several farms, and integrated eco-farming to realize a \nrecycling  economy  with  increased  biomass  use  and  improvement  of  rural  livelihoods.  The \noverall  benefits  of  the  project include  (i)  replacement  of  fossil  fuel energy  with  renewable \nbiomass energy in rural areas to achieve a low-carbon economy; (ii) reduction of the impact of \nthe  country\u2019s  economic  growth  on  global  warming  by  collecting  and  using  methane  gas \ngenerated from the animal waste of livestock farms, and (iii) improved sustainability of the \nrecycling economy by promotion of eco-farming systems and practices.  \n \n2.  Each subproject is assumed to have a life of 20 years following completion of the \ninvestment, with a major replacement of equipment during year 11. Replacement of other \nequipment with a shorter life is included in the operation and maintenance costs. Assuming \nregular and major maintenance is undertaken, this subproject life appears to be reasonable. \nBenefits  from  production  of  biogas  and  generation  of  electricity  are  assumed  to  be  fully \nachieved with the full operation of the biogas plants, while those from organic fertilizer and \nbiogas slurry are assumed to build up gradually over 6 years, reflecting the gradual buildup of \nexperience by the beneficiaries. The buildup of economic benefits is assumed to progress faster \nthan that of financial benefits. Benefits from reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have \nbeen assessed in terms of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), with their value based \non the estimated value of certified emission reductions (CERs). For the financial analysis, the \nvalue of CERs is included for only 10 years. For the economic analysis, this is extended to the \nfull subproject life\u2014reflecting the continued economic value of these environmental benefits. For \nthe economic analysis, economic costs and benefits have been valued at the world price level \nnumeraire. The financial prices of nontraded goods are converted to economic values using a \nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.93.2  The  shadow  wage  rate  factor  for  surplus  labor  was \nestimated at 0.90 of the prevailing wage rate, and the shadow wage rate for scarce labor was \nestimated at 1.0. These were adjusted by the standard conversion factor to derive economic \nvalues. All traded inputs and outputs were valued at their market prices. Financial investment \n                                                 \n1  The financial and economic analyses were carried out for six provinces\u2014Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, \nShandong, and Shanxi\u2014during project preparation. Shanxi and Jiangsu provinces withdrew from the project after \nthe loan fact-finding mission. The analytical results and conclusions are valid for the project. \n2  The standard conversion factor of 0.93 was based on the economic analyses in recent Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) reports and recommendations of the President, e.g., (i) ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region Environment Improvement Project. Manila; and (ii) ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Integrated \nEcosystem and Water Resources Management in the Baiyangdian Basin Project. Manila. \n ", "56   Appendix 14 \n \ncosts have been converted to economic values by deducting taxes and duties; and applying \nrelevant conversion factors to the various investment components including foreign exchange \ncosts,  local  currency  costs,  unskilled  labor,  and  skilled  labor.  The  financial  analysis  was \nconducted based on a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 5.2%, which reflects the \nprevailing commercial bank interest rate for similar loans (6.12%) adjusted by the average \nproportion  of  funds  that  will  be  provided  through  provincial  government  grants.  Economic \nanalysis was based on an opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The economic analysis was \nconducted  following  the  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank.3   \n \nB.  Demand Analysis \n3.  The livestock industry has achieved rapid growth over the past 20 years, with the total \nproduction value estimated at CNY1.3 trillion in 2006. Large and medium-sized livestock farms \ncurrently account for 2% of commercial livestock farms and about 12.5% of the total livestock \nand  poultry  volume  in  the  country.  Within  the  six  participating  provinces,  there  are  about \n3,530 medium-sized  and  large  livestock  farms,  all  of  which  are  suitable  for  bio-digester \nconstruction.   \n \n4.  The main physical outputs of the bio-digesters are (i) energy in the form of biogas or \nelectricity  generated  from  biogas,  and  (ii)  organic  fertilizer  comprising  the  effluent  from \nanaerobic digestion as either liquid sludge or dehydrated solid residue. The volume of output \nfrom either any individual subproject or from the overall project will be insufficient to have any \nsignificant impact, either locally or nationally, on supply; and hence, on market price. CERs \nunder the CDM are another potential project output. In terms of effective thermal energy for \ncooking, 1.0 cubic meters (m3) of biogas can substitute 0.5 kilograms of liquefied petroleum gas, \nwhich sells in the local market for CNY2.50\u2013CNY3.00 per m3. However, coal is the main rural \nhousehold fuel, complemented in some areas by wood and other plant material; and the price of \nthese fuels affects the local willingness to pay for biogas. Local surveys and investigations of \nvillages near the core subproject enterprises confirmed households\u2019 willingness to pay about \nCNY40\u2013CNY50 per month for biogas to be used as the fuel for cooking. Based on data from the \nMinistry of Agriculture, consumption of biogas for cooking in rural households ranges from \n0.8 m3 to 1.2 m3 per day\u2014indicating a willingness to pay of about CNY1.50 per m3.   \n \n5.  Biogas can be converted into electricity by gas engine and electricity generator, and this \nis the main use of biogas in the proposed subprojects. Unlike biogas, which currently has no \nmarket price in the People\u2019s Republic of China, electricity is the main form of commercial energy \ndelivered by the public power grid and consumed by villagers, livestock farms, and township \nenterprises for many years. Although the price of electricity in rural areas of each province may \nvary, historical prices have remained stable. The electricity price in the core subproject areas in \n2008 ranged from CNY0.50 to CNY0.60 per kilowatt-hour. There is a potential market for \norganic fertilizers to produce agricultural products, such as green and organic food. The main \nissue with organic fertilizers is farmers\u2019 willingness to pay. According to the subproject feasibility \nstudy reports (FSRs), farmers in most of the subproject areas currently purchase untreated \nmanure from the livestock farms at a price ranging from about CNY5\u2013CNY25 per ton. When the \nsubprojects are implemented, it is anticipated that farmers will be willing to pay at least the \nsame price for solid organic fertilizer. The situation for slurry, where there is no history of \npayment, is less clear.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \n6.  CERs under the CDM are a significant output of many of the subprojects. Application for \nCDM funding will have to be bundled or will be limited to larger agro-enterprises that can claim \nsufficient CERs and are able to meet the technical standards. Determination of subproject CERs \nmust  follow  standard  procedures  as  set  out  by  the  issuing  agency,  the  United  Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, for developing the project design document. During \ndevelopment of the document, CER estimates can be made for each subproject using approved \nand/or proposed methodologies and with reference to other approved projects.   \n \nC.  Least-Cost Analysis \n7.  Identification of the least-cost option must take into account the environmental benefits \nassociated with the subprojects and the appropriateness of the alternative treatment options. \nThe simplest option would be to do nothing, but the existing livestock and agro-industrial waste \npollutes  the  environment  and  presents  a  major  health  risk  to  farm  livestock.  In  addition, \nsurrounding human settlements are continuously affected by the strong odor as well as health \nimpacts. The \u201cwithout-project\u201d option would clearly further exacerbate the situation and should, \ntherefore,  be  rejected.  During  the  subproject  feasibility  studies,  alternatives  have  been \nconsidered  for  the  bio-digester  technology  focusing  on  selection  of  the  one  that  is  most \nappropriate for the type of feedstock and that will generate biogas in the most efficient manner. \nGiven the range of feedstock envisaged, the least-cost solution will vary between subprojects.   \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Benefit Analysis \n1.  Financial Analysis \n8.  Financial costs. Subproject costs were obtained from the provincial FSRs. The data \nwere entered into COSTAB for overall project cost estimates as well as core subproject cost \nestimates. The main cost categories include civil works; equipment installation; equipment; \nvehicles; and survey, design, and supervision. The total base cost of the core subprojects is \nabout  CNY171.8  million,  including  CNY44.8  million  for  civil  works;  CNY78.1  million  for \nequipment;  CNY9.2  million  for  installation  and  testing;  CNY3.5  million  for  vehicles;  and \nCNY36.2 million for survey, design, and supervision. Other than for the Weiwei subproject, the \nexpenditure on vehicles for handling of organic fertilizer is negligible. The costs of operation and \nmaintenance were based on the costs estimated in each subproject feasibility study and range \nfrom 5.0% to 7.5% of base costs.  \n \n9.  Financial benefits. The main direct benefits of the subprojects are (i) recovered gas \n(predominantly methane) from the anaerobic digesters that will be used either as fuel gas for \nhousehold cooking or converted into electricity for direct use by the livestock farms, sale to local \nconsumers through a special purpose grid, or sale to the public grid; (ii) recovered effluent from \nanaerobic digestion that can be used directly as an organic fertilizer; and (iii) reduced GHG \nemissions that can be sold as CERs. For some subprojects, there are also financial benefits in \nterms of pollution levy reductions and reduced wastewater treatment costs. \n \n10.  Financial internal rate of return. The financial analysis was conducted both with and \nwithout the income from CERs to assess their importance to the individual subprojects. The \nresults are summarized in Table A14.1. Excluding income from CERs, all core subprojects are \nassessed as financially viable, having financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) in excess of the \nWACC of 5.20%. The FIRRs of these subprojects range from 6.0% to 11.9%. If income from \nsale of CERs is included, the FIRRs are increased to 8.3%\u201316.8% indicating the value to be \nderived from the CDM.  \n ", "58   Appendix 14 \n \nTable A14.1: Estimated Financial Indicators by Core Subproject \nExcluding CERs  Including CERs \nFIRR  FNPVa  FIRR  FNPVa \nProvince  Subproject  (%)  (CNY million)  (%)  (CNY million) \nHeilongjiang  Hexie  9.5  4.19  11.7  6.07 \nHeilongjiang  Jinli  8.0  1.49  11.6  3.20 \nHenan    Haoyun  11.9  4.04  16.4  6.42 \nHenan    Huimin  10.0  5.05  16.4  10.99 \nJiangsu   Weiwei  6.5  4.75  8.3  11.03 \nJiangxi   Jinmu  11.3  1.85  16.8  3.20 \nJiangxi   Lulin  7.9  1.16  12.4  2.95 \nShandong  Lvyuan  6.9  4.55  8.9  9.67 \nShandong  Zhongkang  9.9  11.27  10.7  12.79 \nShanxi   Wantong  6.0  1.33  9.4  6.40 \nCER = certified emission reduction, CNY = yuan, FIRR = financial internal rate of return; FNPV = financial net \npresent value. \na  The discount rate used for estimating the FNPV is the weighted average cost of capital.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  2.  Economic Analysis \n11.  The economic analysis of the core subprojects was conducted, treating the biogas plants \nas the unit of analysis independent of the livestock farms and assuming the sustainability of \nmanure supply. This was based on the conclusion of the sector analysis that the animal industry \nwill continue to develop and that large livestock farms will continue to be financially sustainable. \n \n12.  Economic costs. The financial costs of the subproject were converted into economic \nvalues by deducting the cost of taxes and adjusting the foreign exchange costs by the shadow \nexchange rate factor. All costs incurred prior to loan appraisal are treated as sunk costs. \n  \n13.  Economic benefits. The economic value of electricity is assumed to be the market price \nof electricity as reported to be paid by the beneficiary. Since electricity is also proposed to be \nsold to the surrounding community, and this sale will be at a subsidized price, the subsidy has \nbeen removed from the price, with the result that the economic price for electricity is the same \nregardless of consumer. The economic price for organic fertilizer should ideally be estimated \nbased on its economic value to the crops on which it is applied. As such, it should reflect the \neconomic value of inputs saved as a result of the use of organic fertilizer, reported to be a \nsaving in the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, together with the economic value of \nincreased and improved crop output. While there are qualitative statements about all of these \nbenefits, there are not sufficient data for adequate quantification. Therefore, an alternative \napproach was adopted in which the economic value was assumed to be equal to the expected \nmarket price at full subproject development after 6 years. A gradual buildup was assumed over \nthis period. Since CERs are purchased on the international market, they are treated as traded \ngoods and the economic value estimated accordingly. Moreover, the economic benefit from \nCERs is assumed to be received for the full subproject life since, even if they cannot be sold, \nthe plant is expected to remain operational and the environmental benefit to continue. Pollution \nlevies are treated as a transfer payment, so they are not included as an economic benefit. \n \n14.  Economic internal rate of return. The estimated economic internal rates of return \n(EIRRs) of the core subprojects are shown in Table A14.2. For the economic analysis, only the \nEIRRs including CERs were shown since these economic values are considered to be received \nwhether or not the subproject receives financial payment for CERs. The economic analysis \n ", "  Appendix 14  59 \nindicates that all core subprojects included are economically viable, with EIRRs ranging from \n12.2% to 23.6%. Similarly, all subprojects have positive economic net present values.  \n \nTable A14.2: Estimated Economic Indicators by Core Subproject \nIncluding CERs \nEIRR  ENPVa \nProvince  Subproject  (%)  (CNY million) \nHeilongjiang  Hexie  14.8  1.81 \nHeilongjiang  Jinli  16.5  1.53 \nHenan    Haoyun  19.9  3.01 \nHenan    Huimin  20.0  5.92 \nJiangsu   Weiwei  14.0  4.59 \nJiangxi   Jinmu  23.6  2.11 \nJiangxi   Lulin  16.0  1.19 \nShandong  Lvyuan  12.2  0.34 \nShandong  Zhongkang  14.3  3.05 \nShanxi   Wantong  14.0  2.10 \nCER = certified emission reduction, CNY = yuan, EIRR = economic internal rate of \nreturn, ENPV = economic net present value \na  The discount rate used for estimating the ENPV is the opportunity cost of capital, \nwhich is 12%. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Risk and Sensitivity Analysis \n15.  Sensitivity analyses have been undertaken for both the financial and economic analyses, \nin the former case both with and without payment for CERs. The sensitivity tests assessed the \nimpact of increased costs, reduced benefits, and lag in generation of benefits as well as more \nspecific  tests  relating  to  the  reduced  income  from  CERs,  reduced  generation  of  biogas \nassociated with reduced benefits from CERs, and a lag in the receipt of CER benefits. From a \nfinancial perspective, the results indicate that the subprojects are sensitive to cost increases, \nbenefit decreases, and benefit lags if the CER income is excluded. If this income is included, the \nsubprojects are more robust. From an economic perspective, the subprojects are reasonably \nrobust. In general, the subprojects are all sufficiently robust with respect to changes in CER \nvalues or lag in CER benefits.  \n \nF.  Distribution Analysis \n16.  Distribution  analysis  involves  the  allocation  of  net  economic  benefits  between  the \nvarious project beneficiaries as well as between the poor and the nonpoor both within the \ndirectly benefiting area of the subproject and the overall subproject province. The benefits to the \npoor in the provinces arise as a direct result of the project benefits accrued by the provincial \ngovernments. Since the main direct beneficiaries of the subprojects are the large livestock farms \nand agro-industries that are implementing the subprojects, the economic benefits to surrounding \ncommunities in which the poor are located are relatively small. Estimated poverty impact ratios \nof the core subprojects range from 0.00 for Weiwei and Lvyuan to 0.10 for Wantong.   \n \nG.  Financial Affordability and Sustainability Analysis \n17.  Financial affordability analysis compared the enterprise\u2019s annual profit before tax with \nthe counterpart contribution expected to be financed by the enterprise, excluding provincial \ngovernment grants. To be considered affordable, enterprises were expected to be capable of \n ", "60   Appendix 14 \n \ngenerating 50% of the required counterpart funds from 1 year of profits. Based on this criterion, \neight of the 10 core subprojects have sufficient capacity to finance the counterpart contribution. \nThe two that fail to satisfy this criterion are Jinli (48%) and Huimin (27%). However, based on \nthe soundness of these commercial enterprises, it is considered that they will be able to finance \nthe investment from other sources. Sustainability analysis indicates that all enterprises will be \nable to generate sufficient income from biogas and/or electricity and sale of organic fertilizer to \nrepay the loan.  \n ", "Appendix 15  61 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry and Project Title:  People\u2019s Republic of China          \n        Integrated Renewable Biomass Energy Development Sector Project \nLending/Financing  Sector  Department/  East Asia Department \nModality:  Loan  Division:  Agriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources Division \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nAfter  30  years  of  poverty  alleviation  efforts,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  achieved \nsignificant progress. With an average annual growth rate of 9.7% since the 1970s, the population living \nunder a dollar per day has decreased by 246 million between 1990 and 2004. Yet poverty remains, \nincreasingly concentrated in more vulnerable, remote, and isolated mountain areas in the rural central \nand western regions. This has led the government to prioritize the reduction of rural\u2013urban, interior\u2013\ncoastal income inequality and improvement of rural livelihoods. Sustaining growth is vital for poverty \nreduction, but this will not be possible without addressing environmental degradation and the strain on \nnatural resources. Consequently in its 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010, the government is committed to \nbuilding  a  harmonious  society  and  a  socialist  market  economy  that  is  energy-efficient  and \nenvironmentally friendly.a In October 2007, the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of China pledged \nto continue and extend reforms along these lines, setting the aim to eliminate poverty by 2020. The \nNational Poverty Alleviation Program (2001\u20132010) lays out concrete interventions for poverty reduction, \nwhich include development of environmentally sustainable crop and animal production; increase in \nagricultural productivity; investments in economic infrastructure, promotion of agricultural industrialization, \nand  promotion  of  economic  cooperatives.  More  technically,  the  decision  on  new  countryside \ndevelopment, promulgated in February 2006, highlights biogas system development in rural areas as an \nimportant element of improved rural livelihoods. The Ministry of Agriculture also issued the Development \nPlan  on  Agricultural  Biomass  Industry  (2007\u20132015)  in  July  2007.  The  plan  calls  for  an  ambitious \ndevelopment of renewable energy from biogas utilizing agricultural waste to improve the environment and \nrural livelihoods.  \nFollowing the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan and other national strategies, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB) country partnership strategy for the PRC (2008\u20132010) emphasizes inclusive growth through \nbalanced development and environmental sustainability.b More focus will be given to poorer provinces \nand promotion of integrated rural development while helping to strengthen environmental management. \nADB will pay greater attention to poverty reduction, management of natural resources and ecosystems, \nincreasing its investment in natural resources management, agriculture, and rural development. \nThe proposed Integrated Renewable Biomass Energy Development Sector Project supports both the \nPRC\u2019s and ADB\u2019s strategic priorities by contributing to a better environment and rural livelihoods through \nbiogas development, primarily in the central provinces. The project aims to develop a market environment \nfor medium- and large-scale biogas plants as a basis for biomass energy development while ensuring an \nintegrated approach for eco-farming to realize a sustainable circular economy and improve the rural \nlivelihood in participating provinces, including Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangxi, and Shandong. The overall \nbenefits of the project include (i) replacement of fossil fuel by renewable biomass energy in rural areas to \nachieve a low-carbon economy, (ii) reduction of the adverse impacts of the country\u2019s economic growth on \nglobal warming by collecting and using methane gas emissions generated from animal biomass waste of \nlivestock farms and agroprocessing plants, and (iii) ensured sustainability of the circular economy by \ndeveloping eco-farming systems and emission reduction practices. The poverty and social analysis \nshows that the project will contribute to (i) an improved environment because of replacement of fossil \nfuels, (ii) better livelihoods through provision of heat and electricity generated from biogas, (iii) increased \nemployment opportunities and income generation activities from temporary job creation during the bio-\ndigesters\u2019 construction and permanent job creation during operation, (iv) increased farmers\u2019 income \nthrough greater demand for animal husbandry and crop plantation from expanded agro-enterprises, \n(v) increased income through promotion of eco-farming, and (vi) improved health and sanitary conditions \nthrough the use of clean energy and appropriate agricultural waste management. \n ", "62   Appendix 15 \n \nB. Poverty Analysis                             Targeting Classification: General \n1. Key Issues  \nThe participating provinces occupy an important position in the national economy. The gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) of these provinces totaled CNY8.5 trillion in 2007, accounting for 34% of the national \nGDP. The total grain production equaled 37% of the national total. The economic growth rate was 14.2% \non average among the participating provinces, 3.1% higher than the national average. The annual per \ncapita GDP in project areas in 2007 was CNY22,410, which is CNY3,476 higher than the national \naverage of CNY18,934. This does not mean, however, that all six provinces are well off. The project \nareas\u2019 average was higher because of the relatively well-off provinces\u2014Jiangsu and Shandong.  \nThe per capita GDPs of Heilongjiang, Henan, and Jiangxi are all lower than the national average. The \nlowest is in Jiangxi (CNY12,633). Since 2009, the PRC has adopted the new \u201clow-income poverty line\u201d of \nCNY1,067 per capita per year as the general poverty line. According to this new poverty line in early \n2009, about 43.2 million rural poor remain in the PRC accounting for 4.2% of the rural population. \nHowever, each province has set its own poverty standards. In Shandong and Jiangsu, an income of \nCNY1,000 per capita per year is poor; under CNY1,500 is considered \u201clow-income.\u201d The absolute poverty \nline is set at annual per capita income of CNY360 in Henan and Jiangxi, and CNY800 in Shandong. \nAccording to national standards used in 2008 (CNY683 for absolute poverty, CNY944 for low-income \npoverty), the project areas account for 1.13 million poor, of which 424,600 are absolute poor and 709,000 \nare low-income people. They account for 3% of the total population in the project areas. \nThe participating provinces still face persistent poverty, more pronounced in Henan and Jiangxi. There \nare 101 national poverty counties and 148 provincial poverty counties in the six provinces. The total poor \npopulation in the project area is 11.3 million, of which 4.2 million live in absolute poverty and 7.1 million \nare categorized low-income families.  \nAmong the 142 subprojects to be financed by the project, 22 are located in national poverty counties \naccounting for 14.3% of total subprojects; and 44 are in provincial poverty counties accounting for 29% of \ntotal  subprojects.  Jiangxi  has  the  largest  amount  of  subprojects  in  poverty  counties,  40  in  total, \naccounting for 26% of total subprojects. Among the 11 core subprojects, there are three core subprojects \nlocated in poverty counties\u2014one in Henan national poverty county and two in Jiangxi provincial poverty \ncounties. \nThe socioeconomic study shows that most of the poverty in the project areas was caused by lack of \nproductive  labor  force  in  the  household  and  illness.  Low  income  was  due  to  lack  of employment \nopportunities and lack of sufficient knowledge or skills to secure good jobs. \n2. Design Features \nThe project will benefit farmers in three aspects. First, eco-farming, which is promoted under the project, \nwill bring greater economic benefits to the poor by reducing the expenses on chemical fertilizer and \nincreasing the price of their agricultural products. It is estimated that about 11,000 poor households will \nbenefit from eco-farming, with income increased on average by CNY527 per household. Second, farmers \nwill benefit from more secure access to market, better selling prices in some cases, provision of improved \nseeds, and latest skills through contract farming with agro-enterprises that would expand their production \ncapacity under the project. Third, a fraction of poor households will benefit from new employment \nopportunities created under the project. It is estimated that biogas plant construction will provide about \n6,000 temporary job opportunities to the poor, increasing their income by a total of CNY4,000 on average \nover  about  3  months.  During  operation,  about  1,700  poor  farmers  will  receive  relatively  stable \nemployment  opportunities  such  as  supplying  agricultural  products  (animal  husbandry)  to  agro-\nenterprises. Their annual income is expected to rise to about CNY13,000 per person. To expand the \nbenefit, the project encourages local governments, agro-enterprises, the Ministry of Labor and Social \nSecurity, and the All China Women\u2019s Federation to cooperate and provide unskilled jobs (such as 20%) to \nvulnerable groups such as the poor and women. In addition, the project aims to provide agricultural skills \nand biogas management skills training for the vulnerable. \n ", "Appendix 15  63 \nThere are other indirect benefits. First, the project will improve poor farmers\u2019 energy situation and \necological environment. The main source of energy for the poor is coal, wood, and straw. In some poor \nareas, they use trees for fuel. There are 15 subprojects, which plan to supply biogas to neighboring \nfarmers. Through these subprojects, it is estimated that about 11,000 poor households will benefit from \nbiogas energy. Second, the project will improve the poor\u2019s living environment. Biogas projects promote \nbetter livestock and poultry manure management, which in turn improves the air, water, and soil quality in \nthe vicinity. Further, health risks will be reduced. It is estimated that 5,200 poor households will benefit \nfrom improved environment. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \nA poverty and social analysis was undertaken in line with ADB guidelines to collect detailed social \ninformation  necessary  to  inform  project  design,  identify  poverty  reduction  and  social  development \nimpacts, and mitigate any negative socioeconomic impacts. \nDirect social benefits for the entire rural population, including the poor farmers, are as follows:  \n(i)  Creation  of  new  job  opportunities  for  biogas  plant  construction  and  operation. It  is \nestimated that all subproject construction will provide about 6,000 temporary jobs (5,251 for \nfarmers), bringing income worth CNY4,000 on average over 3 months. For biogas plant operation \n(including the Clean Development Mechanism), it is estimated that over 1,700 new long-term job \nopportunities will be generated. Jobs include biogas plant maintenance, crop planting and animal \nbreeding, and cleaning. It is expected that these jobs will increase the per capita income to above \nCNY13,000.  \n(ii)  Benefits from eco-farming. It is estimated that the total contribution of all subprojects through \neco-farming will be CNY158 million. This will raise the average income by CNY558 per year per \nhousehold.  \n(iii)  Expansion of agro-enterprises. Over 33,500 farmers are expected to benefit from sales of \nlivestock to these agro-enterprises. Contract farmers\u2019 annual household income will total on \naverage CNY44,200. Even non-contract farmers will have opportunities to sell their livestock to \nand get service from agro-enterprises, and it is estimated that their annual household income will \nincrease up to CNY16,533. \nIn addition, the project brings the following social benefits: First, the project provides clean energy for \nfarmers and improves their energy consumption. It is estimated that about 49,800 farmer households can \nuse biogas to replace straw, wood, or coal; this protects the environment and reduces women\u2019s workload. \nSome enterprises plan to supply farmers with low-priced electricity, which improves farmers\u2019 access to \nenergy. Second, by promoting proper waste management, an estimated 76,930 households will benefit \nfrom improved environment and health.  \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nStakeholder meetings and focus group discussions were the primary means of consultation. Participants \nincluded representatives of provincial and county governments, core subprojects representatives (agro-\nenterprises), and farmers. Fourteen meetings and nine focus group meetings with 37 farmers were \nconducted to (i) introduce the project components, (ii) solicit their views of the project, (iii) understand \nfarmers\u2019 views and expectations for the project, and (iv) identify potential social risks of the project.  \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring? \n   Information sharing    Consultation    Collaborative decision making    Empowerment  \nPublic consultation and participation, which have been key elements of the project design, will continue \nduring  the  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  Through  continued  consultation  and \nparticipation, the project aims to (i) meet the evolving needs and expectations of the beneficiaries, (ii) \nincrease  the  awareness  of  the  public  about  the  benefits  of  the  project,  (iii)  encourage  the  active \ninvolvement of local communities to maximize their support for the project, and (iv) raise the social \nacceptance of the project. \n \n ", "64   Appendix 15 \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?    Yes    No  \n  If a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan \n(including budget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nMaximizing the social impacts need full cooperation between the agro-enterprises and farmers. It is \nimportant to set up a channel for information sharing and communication. Given the close relationship \nbetween agro-enterprises and farmers and no negative safeguard issues or any other negative social \nimpacts arising from the project, there is no need to set up a C&P plan. The existing village committee will \nbe  responsible  for  public  participation.  The  project  management  office  will  ensure  that  enterprise \nmanagement agencies closely cooperate with village committees. \nC. Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues \nAs more men migrate to urban centers, it is primarily the women who bear the bulk of agricultural \nproduction. Moreover, women have the primary responsibility of cooking and fetching firewood. The \nproject aims to tackle these issues by (i) giving training opportunities to women to help them improve their \nagricultural skills, (ii) generating employment opportunities during construction and in operation of biogas \nat agro-enterprises, (iii) increasing income by providing more opportunities of contract farming as agro-\nenterprises expand their capacity, (iv) reducing women\u2019s workload of fetching firewood by replacing it with \nbiogas, and (v) improving the living condition by reducing livestock waste pollution and supplying biogas \nto improve indoor air quality. \n2.  Key  actions.

The  Integrated  Renewable  Biomass  Energy  Development  Sector  Project  aims  to \nestablish a market environment for biomass energy development for large and medium-sized \nlivestock farms and agro-enterprises, and develop an integrated eco-farming system to ensure \nthe fulfillment of the government\u2019s policies on rural biogas energy, reuse of agricultural waste, \nand improvement of rural livelihoods. The project will be implemented following a sector loan \nmodality. The project covers six provinces\u2014Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, \nand Shanxi\u2014covering 142 subproject sites.1 The total capacity of the farms and agroprocessing \noperations  are  about  1,365,350  hogs;  58,180  dairy  cows;  40,100  beef  cattle;  2,466,600 \nchickens; 4,960,000 ducks; and 2,493,465 tons of agroprocessing waste. The total biogas \ngeneration capacity is estimated at 100 million cubic meters (m3) per year and the fertilizer \ngeneration capacity is estimated at 0.9 million tons per year.   \n \n2.  Specific objectives of the project are to reduce pollution from animal waste through \nanaerobic digestion in the subproject farms or agroprocessing plants. The project will build \nbiogas generation facilities and biogas-fed electric generation facilities in the 142 subproject \nsites. The project will improve ecological agriculture, promote renewable energy, and address \nthe overarching goals of poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. The project is \nclassified  as  category B  project, according to  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); and sector loan procedures will be applied. An initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) was prepared for each of six sample subprojects. A summary IEE report was \nprepared summarizing the findings of six IEEs.   \n \nB.  Environmental Benefits and Impacts \n3.  The project is expected to mainly achieve environmental benefits, reduced water and air \npollution, public health improvement, eco-farming expansion, and reduction in greenhouse gas \n(GHG)  emissions.  The  project  will  use  the  solid  and  liquid  waste  from  these  animal  and \nagroprocessing operations, totaling 9.38 million tons per year, as feedstock to produce about \n100 million m3 per year of biogas with anaerobic fermentation technologies. Each year, about \n14 million m3 of the biogas will be transmitted to the local village gas grids, 2 million m3 for \nheating, and the remaining 84 million m3 will be used to generate 120 million kilowatt-hours of \nelectric power. The subprojects will also produce 4.3 million tons of liquid organic fertilizers and \n0.9 million tons of solid organic fertilizers for eco-farming. The project is estimated to result in an \nestimated annual GHG reduction of 1.21 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Subprojects \nthat qualify for the Clean Development Mechanism will be assisted to secure carbon emission \nreduction revenues.  \n \n4.  The  findings  from  the  IEEs  of  the  sample  subprojects  indicate  that  only  minor \nconstruction and operational impacts are expected, but these can be mitigated to acceptable \nlevels by applying adequate construction practices. Other issues that were looked at as part of \nthe environmental assessment included safety issues regarding the production of biogas and \ndisposal  of  possible  waste  products.  Possible  adverse  environmental  impacts  during \nconstruction and operation of subproject facilities include soil erosion, surface runoff and foul \n                                                 \n1  The environmental analysis was carried out for six provinces\u2014Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, \nand Shanxi\u2014during project preparation. Shanxi and Jiangsu provinces withdrew from the project after the loan \nfact-finding mission. The analytical results and conclusions are valid for the project. \n ", "Appendix 16  67 \nodor  from  application  of  biogas  residues,  noise,  and  fire  hazards.  Mitigation  measures, \ninstitutional  arrangements,  environmental  monitoring  and  adjustment  mechanisms,  capacity \ndevelopment for the executing agency and six implementing agencies, and public consultations \nhave  been  proposed.  The  residual  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  assessed  to  be \ninsignificant.   \n \nC.  Environmental Assessment and Review Procedure \n5.  A due diligence review has been carried out to assess the quality and completeness of \n12 People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) environmental assessment reports and to document \nexperiences regarding the process to be applied for the remaining subproject. It was concluded \nthat the project as a whole and the subprojects will fully meet ADB\u2019s environmental and social \nsafeguard  policy  requirements.  The  applied  PRC  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA) \nsystem complies with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy in many aspects, including the preparation of a \nsimplified  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  the  environmental  audit  upon  project \ncompletion, and regular quarterly compliance monitoring.  \n \n6.  For each subproject, key government stakeholders and environmental experts have \nbeen consulted throughout the national EIA process. A questionnaire survey of 50\u2014200 local \nresidents was carried out by each EIA institute. The comments and suggestions received from \nthe survey covered odor prevention and control, water pollution prevention and control, safety \nand sanitation, implementation of mitigation measures and operational supervision by a local \nenvironmental protection bureau (EPB), and employment opportunities for local communities. \nThe stakeholder comments and suggestions have been incorporated into the EIA reports. The \nstakeholder consultation exercises will continue during project implementation following ADB\u2019s \nand the PRC\u2019s procedures and guidelines. The results of the consultations will be included in \nthe semiannual progress reports to be prepared by the executing agency, with assistance from \nthe implementation consultants, and submitted to ADB and the government.  \n \n7.  The EIA and review process complies with the 2003 Environmental Impact Assessment \nLaw, which requires all construction projects to undergo EIA, review, and approval before the \nproposed projects can proceed. Following the PRC\u2019s EIA law, the environmental assessment \nreport required for the subprojects under the project is a tabular environmental impact report \nthat can be prepared by an EIA institute with a class B certificate; and the responsible authority \nfor approval and review of the EIA report for the project is the provincial EPB, as the project \ncovers six provinces and is administered by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). An overview of \nthe other relevant key important laws, regulations, guidelines, and standards governing EIA, and \nthe siting and waste management of livestock breeding operations are included in the summary \nIEE. The authorities and responsibilities for the environmental assessment and review of the \nsubprojects are also identified in the summary IEE.  \n \n8.  The environmental assessment and review procedure, attached to the summary IEE, \nprovides  a  procedural  framework  for  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  of  the \nsubprojects. The PRC regulations do not have provisions for public participation for a project for \nwhich a tabular environmental impact report is required. This gap has been filled for the sample \nsubprojects  by  requiring  additional  public  consultations  to  be  conducted.  All  remaining \nsubprojects will also be required to conduct public consultations. Furthermore, the guidelines for \ntechnical specification and performance of medium- and large-scale biogas plants have been \n ", "68   Appendix 16 \n \nprepared, which include a list of environmental criteria for the selection of subprojects.2 The \nenvironmental  criteria  have  been  developed  and  used  for  the  subproject  screening  and \nselection throughout project preparation. They will be used for further subproject screening and \nselection.   \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements and Monitoring Procedures \n9.  MOA as the executing agency will have the overall accountability for all subprojects for \nensuring  compliance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  as  well  as  the \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Each implementing agency \nwill be responsible for implementing the specific mitigation measures as contained in the EMP \nof  the  particular  subproject.  Within  the  implementing  agency,  a  safety  and  environment \nprotection section will recruit three environmental staff; and they will be responsible for ensuring \nimplementation of the mitigation measures in the EMP and corrective actions, and coordinating \nfor environmental audit and monitoring. \n \n10.  For  each  subproject,  the  provincial  EPB  has  been  involved  in  planning  and  is  the \nresponsible agency for reviewing and approving the domestic EIA report following the PRC\u2019s \nEIA Law of 2003 and relevant regulations. Following the PRC regulatory requirements,3 the \nEPB  will  conduct  an  audit  of  the  environmental  protection  facilities  upon  completion  of \nconstruction; and will issue an approval certificate, if the environmental facilities meet the design \ncriteria, or else issue an order for corrective action. Regular compliance monitoring will be \nconducted  by  the  municipal  environmental  monitoring  center  under  the  delegation  of  the \nmunicipal EPB. \n \n11.  As a sector loan, the project has an evolving scope. It is anticipated that the number of \nsubprojects may be revised, as the subproject preparation moves along and during project \nimplementation.  A  list  of  environmental  criteria  for  the  selection  of  subprojects  has  been \nprepared and already applied for the core subprojects. The environmental criteria to be used for \nfurther subproject screening and selection include regulatory restrictions, safe distance from \nsensitive  objects,  sensitivity  of  local  environment,  carrying  capacity  of  local  farmland,  and \nenvironmental commitment of the enterprise. The executing and implementing agencies will be \nresponsible for using the criteria to screen and select subprojects.  \n \nE.  Staffing Requirements and Budget \n12.  The  total  estimated  budget  for  environmental  monitoring  is  $122,000  for  the  entire \nduration of the project. The estimates of staffing requirements and budget by agro-enterprises to \nensure compliance with both the PRC\u2019s regulations and ADB's policies are presented in the \nsummary IEE. Coordination, technical analysis, and monitoring will be necessary for completing \nthe environmental assessments, including the preparation of EIA reports, public consultations, \nenvironmental  audit  upon  completion,  regular  environmental  monitoring,  reporting,  and \ncoordination and management.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2009.
