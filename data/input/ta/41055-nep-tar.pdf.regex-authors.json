INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  discussions  for  the  Country  Operations  Business  Plan  2007\u20132009,  the \nGovernment  of  Nepal  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s equity investment in the West Seti Hydroelectric Project (WSHP) to promote \npublic-private partnership in the power sector. The WHSP, which is being developed by a \nprivate sponsor, will have joint assistance from ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department \nand  South  Asia  Department  (SARD).  ADB  conducted  a  Fact-Finding  Mission  on  21\u201326 \nSeptember 2007 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, scope, \ncost estimates, financing, implementing arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference \nfor the technical assistance (TA).  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    The ADB country strategy for Nepal addresses poverty reduction through sustainable \neconomic  growth,  social  development,  good  governance,  environmental  management,  and \nprivate sector development. Development of hydropower for export will play a vital role in \nachieving ADB\u2019s goals to generate employment and support income growth, human resource \ndevelopment, capacity building, and sustainable management of natural resources. \n \n3.    Because  of  its  natural  resources  and  physical  location,  Nepal  is  well-positioned  to \ndevelop  hydroelectric  energy  as  a  major  source  of  growth  and  it  is  entering  a  period  of \neconomic  growth  that  will  depend  on  effective  management  of  one  of  its  main  natural \nresources\u2015river water. The revenue generated from hydropower projects will facilitate the \nimplementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  initiatives  and  ensure  long-term \nsustainable development. Nepal also needs to consider harnessing its vast hydroelectric power \npotential in a socially and environmentally sustainable way. The WSHP will give Nepal the \nopportunity to earn foreign exchange from electricity export to India. Such export will provide the \nGovernment with a major increase in fiscal revenue, which is needed to fund service delivery \nand basic infrastructure in the fields of health, education, and other social sectors. Therefore, \nthe WSHP is an integral part of the Government\u2019s development framework, which aims to \nachieve the country\u2019s medium- and-long-term economic growth and poverty reduction objectives.  \n \n4.    An energy development study for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \ncountries  recommended  the  implementation  of  priority  subregional  hydropower  projects  to \nfacilitate the expansion of cross-border power trade. The WSHP will utilize Nepal\u2019s natural \nresources and export power to meet India\u2019s increasing power demand. Therefore, the WSHP \nwill bring institutional investor confidence in developing hydropower projects in Nepal and set a \ngood example for regional cooperation and private-public partnerships. \n \n5.       The WSHP involves the construction and operation of a 750-megawatt (MW) storage-\ntype hydroelectric power generation facility on the Seti River in the far western region of Nepal, \none of the most underdeveloped areas in the country, on a build-own-operate-transfer basis. \nThe West Seti Hydro Limited (WSHL), which is promoted by a private sector project sponsor, \nsigned  a  project  agreement  (PA)  with  the  Government  in  June  1997.  Under  the  PA,  the \nGovernment  assured  to  grant  all  licenses  to  WSHL  for  the  development,  construction, \nownership, and operation of the WSHP, including generation and transmission licenses for a \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 October 2007. \n \n ", "2   \nperiod of 30 years from the date of issue of the license. The electricity generated will be \nexported to India. Other project and financial arrangements including the financing structure are \nbeing finalized between the project sponsors and the various stakeholders with support from \nPSOD. \n \n6.    The project sponsors have conducted a detailed feasibility study that covered technical \nand financial viability and the social and environmental safeguards. ADB constituted a team \ncomprising  members  from  PSOD,  SARD,  and  Regional  and  Sustainable  Environment  and \nSocial Safeguards Division (RSES). The team is working together with consultants financed by \nthe project sponsors on the environmental and social areas to ensure they are in line with ADB \npolicies and procedures, and a summary environmental impact assessment report has been \ndisclosed  on  the  ADB  website  since  21  August  2007.  Further  supplementing  studies  with \nrespect to financial governance and support for community development are required to prepare \nthe Government\u2019s equity investment in the WSHP. The challenge for the Government is to \nensure that the social and environmental impact of the WSHP is fully addressed by way of a \ndetailed program of mitigation, compensation, and offsetting measures. ADB\u2019s involvement in \nthe WSHP will ensure that the social and environmental inputs are addressed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s environmental and social policies and procedures. The Government is developing a \ncomprehensive policy framework to ensure that the revenue benefits of the WSHP are properly \nchanneled to the priority areas of the economy that have strong links to its poverty reduction \nstrategy. The Government needs assistance to ensure that its plans are carried out in line with \ncurrent international best practices.  \n \n7.  ADB is of the opinion that the best approach for successfully implementing the WSHP is \npublic-private partnership, which includes financial participation of the Government in the WSHP. \nIn this regard, ADB will assist the Government by providing funding from ADB\u2019s public sector \nwindow for the Government\u2019s equity participation in the WSHP. ADB\u2019s private sector window is \nalso preparing a combination of equity, loan, and guarantee for the WSHP.  ADB\u2019s involvement \nin the WSHP through its public sector window will ensure that (i) social and environmental \nimpacts  have  been  properly  identified  and  mitigated  in  line  with  good  practice  and  ADB \nsafeguard policies; and (ii) sufficient project revenues are allocated and properly channeled to \npoverty reduction initiatives. ADB\u2019s involvement will also support the WSHP in obtaining broad \nsupport from international funding agencies and civil society for Nepal\u2019s development strategy \nand, more specifically, the development of the hydropower projects.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.     The TA will assist the Government to participate in a project to develop its large \nhydropower  resources  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  responsible  manner \nthrough public-private partnership.  \n \nB.  Output \n9.     Specifically,  the  TA  will  help  the  Government  prepare  a  framework  for  managing \nrevenues generated from the export of power from the WSHP to neighboring countries to \ncomply with the highest standards of governance and accountability and for the proceeds to be \nproperly used for poverty reduction programs, including improved delivery of social services. \nThe TA will also identify the needs of the communities in the project area in terms of area \ndevelopment and livelihood programs. \n ", "                      3\n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.     The  TA  will  conduct  the  assessments,  identify  and  design  appropriate  fiscal \ngovernance measures, carry out economic and financial due diligence for the Project, and \nprepare a local area development program to be implemented by the Government and to \ndovetail with the social development programs undertaken by WSHL. \n \n11.           Key activities include:  \n \n(i)  assessing the macroeconomic impacts of the proposed WSHP, including external    \nbalances, fiscal, and monetary effects; \n(ii)  assessing the impact of borrowing and investing in the WSHP on the Government\u2019s \nfinancial plans and budget; \n(iii)  conducting  public  finance  and  budget  analysis  to  design    a  comprehensive \nframework of governance measures and monitoring mechanisms for the handling of \nrevenues and expenditures from the  WSHP in line with best practices; \n(iv)  analyzing the potential for economic growth and social development through benefits \nfrom projects; \n(v)  performing  project-related  financial,  economic,  social,  poverty  reduction,  and \ninstitutional analyses; and  \n(vi)  preparing a small-scale local area development program for the project-affected area. \n \n12.          No major risks are associated with the TA, and the Government has expressed its \nstrong support for it. Appendix 2 summarizes the initial poverty and social analysis of the Project. \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $300,000 \nfrom the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund. The Government will finance $100,000 in \nthe form of in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates are presented in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which will \nappoint a senior staff member as the project director. The TA will finance the services of \ninternational and national consultants who will be engaged individually by ADB in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nInternational consultants will be engaged for 8 person-months, and national consultants, for \nanother 4 person-months. The TA will start in December 2007 and will be completed by the end \nof June 2008. A project management office (PMO) will be established in MOF. The PMO will be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the TA and will coordinate with all government \nand non government stakeholders of the proposed TA. The PMO will also oversee consultants\u2019 \nactivities and facilitate all ADB activities for TA administration and loan project processing \nactivities.  \n \n15.  The following experts will be recruited as consultants: (i) a macroeconomist, (ii) a public \nfinancial management specialist, (iii) a power sector economist and financial analyst, and (iv) a \n ", "4   \nsocial development specialist. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix \n4. \n \n16.  The consultants will submit an inception report 2 weeks after the TA starts and a draft \nfinal report 3 months later. The team leader will be responsible for the submission of these \nreports. The Government and ADB will provide comments after the discussion of the draft final \nreport at a tripartite meeting. At the end of 4 months, the consultants will submit the final report \nincorporating Government and ADB comments on the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government \nof Nepal to be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund \nunder the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility for preparing the \nWest Seti Hydroelectric Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n ", "                      Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact        \n(for the ensuing project)       \nEconomic development in  Higher economic growth, and  Gross domestic data    \nNepal  improved quality of life and     \n  environment in Nepal     \n       \n(for the TA)       \nIncreased production and  \u2022  Construction of a hydroelectric  Review missions  Assumption \nuse of affordable clean  power plant with 750  Progress reports   The Government and \nenergy in a financially  megawatts (MW)  generation    private entities are \nsustainable manner  capacity including dam,    willing to form a \nthrough hydropower  associated tunnels,    successful public-\ngeneration.   underground power station,    private partnership \n  associated civil works,    that will construct and \nGenerate revenue for the  switchyard and transmission    operate the required \nGovernment of Nepal  line to the Indian border    hydropower facilities \nthrough revenue share,    Audit reports   \nroyalties, taxes, and  \u2022  Production of 3,300 gigawatts  Electricity data from  Risk \ndividends from the  (GW) of electricity: 2,970 GW  utilities  Project preparation \nProject for its poverty  to be exported to India and    and construction are \nreduction programs  330 GW to provide electricity    delayed.. \n  to Nepal consumers by 2012     \n  Annual budgets and \n\u2022  Revenue share clearly  financial statements \nreflected in annual budget \nallocations for poverty \nreduction programs \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n(for the ensuing project)       The Government and \n      private entities are \nIncreased production and  \u2022  Construction of a hydroelectric  Review missions  willing to form a \nuse of affordable clean  power plant with 750 MW   Progress reports  successful public-\nenergy in a financially  generation capacity, including    private partnership \nsustainable manner  dam, associated tunnels,    that will construct and \nthrough hydropower  underground power station,    operate the required \ngeneration   associated civil works,   \nhydropower facilities.. \n  switchyard and transmission   \n \nGenerate revenue for the  line to the Indian border   \nRisk \nGovernment of Nepal     \nProject preparation \nthrough revenue share,  \u2022  Production of 3,300 GW of  Audit reports  and construction are \nroyalties, taxes, and  electricity: 2,970 GW to be   Electricity data from  delayed. \ndividends from the project  exported to India and 330 GW  utilities   \nfor its poverty reduction  to provide  electricity to Nepal     \nprograms  consumers by 2012     \n     \n  \u2022  Revenue share clearly  Annual budgets and \n  reflected in annual budget  financial statements \n  allocations for poverty \n  reduction programs \n ", "6  Appendix 1     \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \n   \n \n \nTA Outcome \nWell-defined investment \nproject for hydropower \ngeneration facility and \ntransmission line. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n(TA)       The EA will obtain \n      required government \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nDespite significant progress in reducing poverty from 42% to 31%, Nepal with a per capita income of $292 per \nannum continues to be one of the poorest countries in the world. The country\u2019s economic growth of 2% barely \nexceeded the population growth rate of 1.9% in 2003.  Nepal ranks 106th out of 177 countries, with a human \ndevelopment index value of 0.53, which is lower than the weighted average for South Asia. While 39.8% of the \npopulation have a connection to electricity, there are marked regional and urban/rural disparities with the mid and far \nwest having the lowest electrification rates at 25.4% and 23.2%, respectively,  severely impeding those regions\u2019 \nability to stimulate rural economic activities.  \n \nThe Government aims to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving extreme poverty and \nhunger by 2015, and to speed the rate of broad-based economic growth to an average 6.2% per annum. \n \nThe project is envisaged to benefit the development of the West Seti Region, which is one of the poorest in the \ncountry. Benefits are expected to come from royalties, levies, duties and taxes, part of which the Government will \nspend locally in directly affected areas. \n \nIn addition, the project will design ad hoc interventions to address the needs of the affected people. \n \nFinally, the project is also expected to create jobs both directly, employing unskilled and semi-skilled workers for \nthe civil works, and indirectly through the economic impulse created by incoming workers. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  Although particular attention will be given to poverty reduction in the \naffected areas, the project will not have poverty reduction as its primary focus. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? A social development specialist, a macro economist and a rural \ndevelopment specialist. \n \n3.  If general intervention, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, \npro-poor governance, and pro-poor growth)? Absolute poverty continues to be high in Nepal with about 8 million \npeople living below the poverty line, and inequality between different income groups, ethnic groups, and \ngeographical regions have widened in the past decade. About 88% of the population live in rural areas, \nwhere the incidence of poverty is more acute (44%) than it is in urban areas, estimated at 23% (UNDP \n2002).  Large segments of the poor are hard-core poor. They barely eke out a living in fragile, vulnerable \necosystems, where large areas lack even the most basic infrastructure as reflected by low socioeconomic \nindicators  at  the  district  level.    The  project  will  support  schemes  on  the  basis  of  Nepal\u2019s  composite \ndevelopment rank comprising indicators such as infrastructure, health, gender, education, employment, \nurban/rural, agriculture, among others; access to electricity; ethnic composition (% of ethnic minorities, \ndisadvantaged castes); and income. The technical assistance (TA) will also design rural development \ninterventions to be implemented during the implementation of the project. \n \n ", "                      Appendix 2  9\n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? Consultations with the affected communities identified a list of interventions that will be designed to improve the \nstandards of life of the communities in the affected areas and increase income opportunities. Moreover, the project is \nexpected to have positive effects on income: work opportunities for unskilled labor and commercial opportunities for \nrestaurants, guest houses, and shops. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? Most of the needs are related to \nresettlement. Nonetheless, the affected communities have specifically asked for improvements in the health centers and \neducation infrastructure, training programs, water, and irrigation. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? Constraints, if any, will be identified and minimized during the PPTA.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the TA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based  organizations,  etc.)? \nResettlement plans (RPs) were prepared during the past 10 years with extended consultations with local communities. It \nis envisaged that the RPs will be implemented in close consultation with the concerned communities and affected \npersons (APs).  There is provision to include APs in (i) the Compensation Fixation Committee, (ii) community meetings \nfor proper dissemination of project information, (iii) capacity-building activities for APs and vulnerable groups to ensure \ntheir effective participation in preparing, managing, and implementing RPs. The project\u2019s RP includes a community \nparticipation  and  implementation  framework  with  a  time-bound  schedule  of  RP  activities  and  delineation  of \nresponsibilities. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  The first part of the consultations was already \ncarried out in the past 10 years. The participatory strategy during the implementation of the project is embedded in the \nRP. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making?  \n  Yes          No    Please explain. Women's control over financial resources is severely limited as shown by the \nlow land (10%) and home ownership rates (6%) for women and these impacts negatively on their decision \nmaking role in strategic areas related to development. The country\u2019s gender development index of 0.51 has \nimproved vis-\u00e0-vis the human development index of 0.53. However, the magnitude of gender inequality in HDI \nindicators is acute in the rural areas. Gender analysis conducted in conjunction with project preparation shows \nthat (i) the majority of the women are illiterate, (ii) women have a higher level of food vulnerability, (iii) incomes \nfor female heads of households were on average 30% those of male heads, (iv) women\u2019s daily wage rate was \n70% that of men, and (v) none of the households with female heads had grid electricity. The lack of female \nfield staff and the lack of awareness among staff of the Executing Agency about gender-differentiated roles \nhave resulted in limited outreach to women. Increased population mobility in search of employment has \ncorrespondingly increased the risk to women of both trafficking and HIV/AIDS. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?         \n          Yes          No    Please explain. Women are more likely to be exposed to HIV/AIDS. The team is preparing an ad hoc \nproject to address the issue. \n ", "10  Appendix 2     \nIII.
