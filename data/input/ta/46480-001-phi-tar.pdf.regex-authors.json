INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In 2011, the Department of Tourism (DOT) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor technical assistance (TA) to improve competitiveness in tourism through interventions to \nsupport a regulatory review, raise service standards, and develop skills. In response, ADB \nconducted consultation missions in 2011. During a November 2011 fact-finding mission, DOT \nagreed  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference as presented in the approved concept paper. Subsequent \nmeetings with DOT, industry, employee groups, and technical and vocational education and \ntraining schools provided additional background information that confirmed the need for TA. The \nTA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for the Philippines.1 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  government  identifies  the  competitiveness  of  industry  and  services  as  a  core \ncomponent of the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016. 3 Its agenda includes creating a \nbetter business environment.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016 is consistent and \naligned  with  the  Philippine  Development  Plan,4 and  identifies  increased  investment  as  an \noutcome indicator. ADB has extensive experience in assisting with improving the investment \nclimate in the Philippines, including assistance to the energy sector, capital market development, \nroad infrastructure, and the business climate.  \n \n3.  In response to private sector demands for structural reforms to specific sectors that hold \npromise for increasing economic growth, the government prioritizes support for several sectors \nin the development plan. The government and the private sector identified tourism for longer-\nterm development based on recent sector growth performance, job creation possibilities across \nthe  archipelago,  and  positive  externalities  to  other  sectors.  Tourism  directly  and  indirectly \nemploys more than 3.7 million; many of these jobs are outside the main urban centers of Manila \nand Cebu.5 Employment through community-based tourism projects has also been growing \nrapidly. Employment and incomes generated through tourism help families escape poverty. \n \n4.  When comparing tourism growth on a regional basis, the Philippines has lagged its \nneighbors. In 2010, about 3.5 million foreign tourists arrived in the Philippines compared with \nmore 20.0 million for Malaysia, 16.0 million for Thailand, and 5.0 million for Indonesia. The \nPhilippines also performs poorly in global surveys of tourism competitiveness. The 2011 World \nEconomic Forum travel and tourism competitiveness index ranks the Philippines 94th of 139 \ncountries due to its poor regulatory framework, business environment, tourism infrastructure, \nand poor service standards (Table 1). These factors have contributed to lower international \ntourist arrivals and tourism revenues relative to regional neighbors. \n \n5.  DOT  and  tourism  providers  are  especially  concerned  about  relatively  lower  service \nstandards and employers complain about the skills mismatch of many school leavers entering \nthe industry. Currently, the hotel and resorts quality assurance rating system is based on \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2012.

Many young people entering the tourism \nindustry  are  not  considered  to  be  adequately  trained.  Vocational  training  curriculums  of \noccupations in the industry are not frequently updated to meet changing international standards \nand practices, and skills development in tourism is underfunded.  \n \nTable 1: Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Subindexes 2011 for \nSelected ASEAN countries \n \nBusiness  Human, Cultural, \nRegulatory  Environment and  and Natural \n  Framework  Infrastructure  Resources \nCountry/Economy   Rank  Score  Rank  Score  Rank  Score \nSingapore  6  5.72  4  5.39  23  4.59 \nMalaysia  60  4.71  40  4.35  18  4.72 \nThailand  77  4.45  43  4.32  21  4.64 \nBrunei Darussalam  96  4.20  50  4.14  63  3.87 \nIndonesia  94  4.21  86  3.33  40  4.35 \nViet Nam  89  4.28  89  3.31  46  4.12 \nPhilippines  98  4.18  95  3.18  75  3.69 \nASEAN =  Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \nSource: World Economic Forum. Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report. Geneva.. \n \n6.  The  government  is  aware  of  these  structural  and  policy  constraints  on  longer-term \ngrowth in tourism. In 2012, DOT endorsed the National Tourism Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 \n(footnote 5). The new plan shifts away from the traditional approach of public provisioning of \nservices to the industry to greater private sector participation. Features of the plan include  \n(i)  adoption  of  a  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  framework  for  hotel  and  resort  quality \nassurance and accreditation; (ii) a PPP in tourism industry skills development and funding; (iii) a \nregulatory review of the tourism industry; and (iv) promotion of  PPPs in infrastructure. \n \n7.  DOT is coordinating development partner support for the National Tourism Development \nPlan.6 Through  this  government-led  coordination,  ADB  is  assisting  DOT  in  implementing \nselected components of its plan through both a programmatic approach and TA (including this \nTA).7 Under subprogram 1 of the Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program \n(ICIG), the government set out the foundations for tourism reforms including an \u201copen skies\u201d \naviation policy and drafted new rating standards for hotels and resorts.8 Subprogram 2 of ICIG \nsets out prior expected actions (or policy triggers) with the central focus on operationalizing \nreforms  to  improve  service  standards  through  pilot  projects.  These  prior  expected  actions \ninclude implementing a regulatory review of the tourism industry, piloting a new hotel and resort \nquality assurance and accreditation system with an international third party assessor engaged \nto assist with the pilot system, and piloting an industry-led skills development program and grant \nscheme. Subprogram 2 is expected to be submitted to the ADB Board of Directors in 2014. The \n                                                \n6 DOT organized the first development coordination meeting on 21 November 2012.

Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be increased employment in the tourism industry as one critical channel \nfor achieving inclusive growth. This will be measured by an increase in employment above the \nlong-term average growth rate (about 3.5% per annum in 2000\u20132010). The outcome will be \nimproved competitiveness of Philippine tourism. This will be measured by an improvement in \nthe ranking of the World Economic Forum\u2019s travel and tourism competitiveness index by at least \n15 places from its 2011 baseline ranking of 94th in the world.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The key activities are divided into three main outputs. \n \n10.  Output  1:  Regulatory  impact  assessment.  DOT  has  started  a  regulatory  impact \nassessment  (RIA)  program  that  will  be  expanded  under  the  TA  to  include  regulatory  and \nlicensing reviews by local government units (LGUs) in four pilot regions: Bohol, Cebu, Davao \nand Palawan. The focus will be on improving regulations to reduce regulatory compliance costs \nof businesses operating in the tourism industry. Output 1 will include the following activities: (i) \nsupport DOT in developing its RIA work plans for 2013\u20132016; (ii) help DOT\u2019s RIA unit and staff \nimplement  the  work  plans  including  support  for  drafting  regulatory  impact  statements  with \nrecommendations for regulatory reforms; and (iii) help DOT staff and selected LGUs design and \nimplement a licensing review program for LGUs.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Hotel and resort quality assurance and accreditation system. The new \nsystem is designed to better signal hotel and resort service standards to visitors and act as a \nmarket-based incentive to lift service standards and promote staff skills development over time. \nOutput 2 will include the following activities: (i) strengthen institutional arrangements for the \nhotel and resort quality assurance and accreditation system to be implemented by DOT;10 (ii) \nprovide capacity development assistance to develop a large pool of independent assessors, and \nto  DOT  staff  engaged  in  the  accreditation  and  certification  service  at  DOT;  and  (iii)  pilot \naccreditation of at least 100 hotels to the new standards in 2013\u20132015. The new system will be \npiloted in the four regions (para. 10). These regions are selected as they are main tourist \ndestinations with a sufficient number of hotels for rating under the new system. An international \nthird party assessor will be engaged to undertake this activity.  \n \n12.  Output  3:  Tourism  industry  skills  development  program.  Output  3  will  include \nupgrading vocational skills and competency in the industry; and provisioning of a skills grant \nscheme for industry, LGUs, and civil society organizations to access training grants. Output 3 \nwill include the following activities: (i) support DOT for industry analysis and planning, (ii) in \n                                                \n9 ADB has provided separate TA supporting PPP in infrastructure, of which PPP projects in tourism are in the \ngovernment\u2019s investment pipeline for 2013.

Manila. \n10 Including: (i) developing a costed medium-term action plan for implementing new standards in the tourism industry \nwith measurable milestones; (ii) assessing feasible options for industry financing of the system; and (iii) developing \nbusiness processes for accreditation and the governance framework covering the duties and responsibilities of the \ncertification committee, assessors, and internal audit. ", "4 \nconsultation  with  industry  stakeholders,  review  and  suggest  revisions  to  the  quality  and \nmanagement  of  tourism  industry  training;11 (iii)  assist  DOT  in  strengthening  industry  and \ninstitutional links; (iv) support DOT in developing a human resource development plan that can \nbe updated annually; and (v) establish the financial management system, operations manual, \nand grant agreements with recipients; and administer the pilot skills grant scheme.  \n \n13.  The skills grant scheme will provide two windows through which industry partnered with \naccredited training providers can access grants for skills development initiatives. The scheme \naims to provide employers and training providers with resources to improve skills and services. \nThe first window will be the private sector window for tourism employers in hotels, resorts, tour \nagencies, and other tourism providers. The second window will be for LGUs and civil society \ngroups. Funding to LGUs will relate to tourism planning, LGU support services, and regulatory \nreview programs. Funding to civil society groups will relate to training workers and informal \nworkers in community-based tourism projects, and youth life skills programs.  \n \n14.  The skills grants will be allocated on a competitive basis, based on project proposals to \nbe  evaluated  using  agreed  indicators  and  criteria.  The  indicators,  criteria,  and  application \nprocess  are  detailed  in  the  draft  standard  operating  procedures  attached  to  the  TA \nadministration manual.12 The ADB-engaged contractor will administer the skills grant scheme \nincluding grant agreements with recipients for delivery of skills training under the scheme. \nAdministration of 50% of the grants under the scheme may be delegated to DOT in a phased-in \napproach starting about halfway through TA implementation (para. 19).  \n \n15.  DOT will establish a national skills tourism project committee to oversee implementation \nof the skills development program and selection of grant recipients. The skills development \nprogram will be piloted in Bohol, Cebu, Davao, and Palawan. In each pilot, a regional tourism \nskills project committee will be established, comprising staff from DOT offices in the localities \nand industry representatives to champion skills development in the pilot regions. The skills \ncommittees will also participate in the evaluations of grant proposals (footnote 11).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $7,116,900 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Canada and administered by ADB.13 The Government of the \nPhilippines will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  DOT will be the executing agency. It will provide office space with furniture and support \nservices for the consultants, while the TA will finance office computers and supplies. ADB will \nrecruit a team of eight international consultants (total of 114 person-months) and ten national \nconsultants (total of 269 person-months) through one contractor to implement all activities under \noutputs  1\u20133  and  manage  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time. An international \n                                                \n11  The review will include completing a gap analysis to identify industry skills that are not currently supported by \nquality training provision. A comprehensive industry skills survey will support the gap analysis. \n12 TA Administration Manual (Supplementary Appendix, available on request).  \n13 CIDA grant of $ 7,000,000 Canadian dollars is equivalent to $ 7,116,900 using exchange rate as of 15 January \n2013. ", "5 \nRIA strategy expert (6 person-months) will be engaged by ADB through individual contract \nservices to develop and support implementation of a national RIA strategy.  Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment procured under the TA will follow \nthe Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and the assets will be \nhanded over to DOT upon TA completion. The team leader, the international finance expert, the \nnational finance expert, the national project coordinator, and the national communications and \nmedia relations expert engaged through the contractor will be attached to the PIU.  Consultant \ndeliverables are included in the terms of references in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The PIU will be established at DOT and funded by the TA. The PIU will be responsible \nfor: (i) coordinating TA activities; (ii) undertaking the overall administrative and supervisory tasks, \ncommunication, financial transactions with ADB, annual auditing, and project monitoring; and  \n(iii) providing administrative support to the project steering committee (PSC) and the national \nand four regional tourism skills project committees. The PSC, chaired by DOT, will oversee TA \nimplementation. Three entities will report to the PSC: (i) DOT\u2019s regulatory impact assessment \nsteering committee, which will be responsible for implementing the regulatory review and reform \nprogram under output 1; (ii) DOT\u2019s Division of Accreditation and Regulation, which will be \nresponsible for implementing the hotel and resort accreditation pilot program under output 2; \nand (iii) the national tourism skills project committee, which will be responsible for implementing \nthe skills development program and skills grant scheme. The skills committee will promote \nawareness and champion skills development in the local tourism industry, promote the skills \ngrant scheme, and select grant recipients under the scheme. The TA may delegate to DOT the \nadministration of up to 50% of the matching grants scheme. An advance payment facility based \non cost estimates of the scheme will be provided to DOT for this purpose (footnote 11). \n \n19.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  4  years,  to  commence  in  March  2013  and  be \ncompleted in February 2017. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n20.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $7,116,900 to the Government of the Philippines to \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Government of Canada for Improving Competitiveness in \nTourism.
