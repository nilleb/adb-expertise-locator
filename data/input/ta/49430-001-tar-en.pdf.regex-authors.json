THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed investment program is a multitranche financing facility which aims to \nimprove basic urban services and promote the local economy in priority aimag (province) capitals \nand soum (subunit of an aimag) centers of Mongolia.1 The geographically targeted and integrated \napproach of the program will focus on priority regional urban clusters (RUCs) that have the \npotential to promote a more resilient and diversified economy to deliver inclusive and sustainable \ngrowth.2 The program will be aligned with the following impact: more sustainable development in \nMongolia driven by multisector economy and ecological balance achieved. The outcome is \npopulation and private sector in targeted RUCs benefitted from improved urban and economic \nfacilities and services. The outputs of the program are (i) municipal infrastructure and urban \nservices in targeted areas improved, (ii) economic infrastructure and facilities in targeted areas \nimproved, (iii) road linkages within targeted urban regions increased, and (iv) capacity in program \nand institutional management strengthened. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the Government of Mongolia to prepare \nthe investment program, which is a complex and multisector undertaking that requires full scale \ndue  diligence  in  technical,  economic,  financial,  social,  resettlement,  environmental,  and \ninstitutional aspects, including in-depth local urban and socioeconomic assessments.3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n \n3.  The preparatory work for the investment program and feasibility study are summarized \nbelow. \n \n4.  Output  1:  Economic  and  urban  development  strategy  formulated  and  project \ncomponents identified. \n(i)   Urban  development  law.  This  suboutput  will  (a)  review  the  current  urban \ndevelopment law and other relevant laws together with the urban development \nsecondary regulations, norms, and codes; (b) provide technical and urban inputs \non the current draft law, urban development secondary regulations, and the city \n                                                \n1  The proposed TA and program with original title of \u201cMongolia Secondary Cities and Soum Centers Development \nInvestment Program,\u201d is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, \n2017\u20132019. Manila. The title was revised to better reflect the objectives and content of the program. The tentative \ntotal cost of the program is estimated at $700 million. The maximum financing amount available under the \nmultitranche financing facility is expected to be $600 million. The ADB financing from ordinary capital resources and \nconcessional ordinary capital resources is expected to reach $360 million (51.4%). ADB-administered cofinancing \nfrom ADB trust funds and development partners is expected to reach $240 million (34.3%). Cofinancing may be \nprovided as loans or grants, and may be parallel or joint. The government will finance $100 million (14.3%) of the \ntotal cost. The total cost of Tranche 1 is estimated at $200 million. \n2 As discussed in the approved concept paper, the National Urban Assessment for Mongolia has identified priority RUC \nsystems as key assets to catalyze local urban economic growth. Upgrading infrastructure and creating synergies \nbetween economic and urban development in the RUCs will increase economies of agglomeration and critical mass, \nmaking RUCs a powerful engine of socioeconomic improvement. Tranche 1 will target RUCs with high potential for \ngrowth and high concentration of manufacturing enterprises while still lagging in terms of investment: (i) west RUC, \nconsisting of Olgii, Hovd, and Ulanngom aimag capitals and surrounding soums; and (ii)  east RUC consisting of \nChoibalsan and surrounding soums. Also, investing in these two RUCs that are located beside the western and \neastern country borders will promote regional integration and improve connectivity and access to external markets. \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 November 2017. \n ", "2 \nand town planning and development norm BNBD 30-01-01; (c) provide relevant \ninputs  on  the  2030  Ulaanbaatar  master  plan  that  is  related  to  the  law; \n(d) recommend ease of doing business and other governance-related indicators to \npromote  local  employment  and  entrepreneurships;  and  (e)  support  the \ndevelopment of final legal document and relevant norms, codes, and regulations.  \n \n(ii)   Regional urban development plan. In the selected RUCs, the following will be \nundertaken: (a) assess human settlement development and migratory dynamics; \n(b) analyze the urban and rural linkage and integration challenges; (c) assess the \ncurrent  urban  infrastructure  shortages  (including  operation  and  maintenance \nchallenges) and their impact on the environment and urban growth; (d) develop \nurban development scenarios, trends, and service demands; (e) study local natural \nresources available to sustain urban growth for each key human settlements; \n(f) formulate an urban cluster and corridor development strategy; and (g) agree on \nthe urban development scenario and develop an urban development plan including \nvision, strategic objectives, and targets and indicators in accordance with the \neconomic development plan. \n  \n(iii)   Regional economic and business development plan. Specific activities in the \nselected RUCs include: (a) undertake a sound analysis of the economic and \nindustrial situation; (b) review the local situation in national and international \ncontexts;  (c) identify  the  main  economic  actors  and  assess  the  business \ndevelopment trends and potential; (d) assess the environmental impacts of existing \nindustries and enterprises; (e) formulate a regional business development plan and \na  job  creation  plan  using  clear  vision,  strategic  objectives,  and  targets  and \nindicators; (f) identify current physical bottlenecks and policy issues to develop \nstrategic objectives, identify physical (urban and economic infrastructure, services, \nfacilities) and non-physical actions (policies, regulation, capacity, institutional) \nnecessary to achieve the plan (especially identified main rules and regulations that \nsupport or impede business creation and small- and medium-sized enterprise \ndevelopment); and (g) synchronize and synergize the economic and business plan \nwith the urban development plan.  \n \n(iv)   Local development plan and priority components. Combining both urban and \neconomic development plans, this suboutput will (a) produce a local development \nplan with specific focus on green development and poverty reduction and social \ndevelopment, (b) select priority aimag capitals and soum centers for investment, \n(c) formulate a model for comprehensive and integrated development for aimag \ncapitals and soum centers, (d) develop a regional and cluster approach to share \nand optimize both urban and economic infrastructure, (e) identify local urban-rural \neconomic potential synergies and linkages, and (f) identify priority components to \nbe financed to meet the economic and urban development strategic objectives and \nvision. Local development plans (a) will also assess the risks associated with \nextreme weather events (especially dzuds)4 and consequences for rural-urban \nmigration, and find ways to mitigate them, and (b) should be in line with the \nNational Program on Reduction of Air and Environment Pollution, 2017\u20132025 and \n                                                \n4 Dzud is a Mongolian term for a severe winter in which large number of livestock die, primarily due to starvation caused \nby lack of grass pasture, and in other cases, directly from the cold. \n ", "3 \nthe  proposed  policy-based  loan  on  Ulaanbaatar  Air  Quality  Improvement \nProgram.5 \n \n5.
