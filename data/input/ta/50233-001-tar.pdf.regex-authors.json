INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  International  Comparison  Program  (ICP),  the  world's  largest  global  statistical \ninitiative implemented under the guidance of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC), \naims to compute measures of gross domestic product (GDP) and its components (household \nconsumption expenditure, government consumption expenditure, consumption expenditure of \nnonprofit institutions serving households, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), and imports and \nexports) based on purchasing power parity (PPP). These measures allow more meaningful \ncross-country comparisons, as they correct for distortions induced by differences in the price \nlevels between countries. \n \n2.  The  PPP-based  estimates  of  GDP  and  its  components  allow  direct  cross-country \ncomparisons of indicators of well-being, such as GDP per capita; or health, education, and \nhousing expenditures per capita. Similarly, PPPs for household consumption have been the \nmain inputs for deriving the international poverty lines (such as $1.25 per day in 2005 PPP, or \n$1.90  per  day  in  2011  PPP)  used  for  computing  internationally  comparable  estimates  of \nextreme  poverty.  In  particular,  the  PPPs  for  household  consumption  from  the  last  three \nbenchmark ICPs have been used to derive the international poverty line and update global \npoverty headcounts.  \n \n3.  From a small research project in 1968 at the University of Pennsylvania, the ICP has \ngrown into a global statistical operation; 146 economies participated in the 2005 ICP and 199 \neconomies participated in the 2011 ICP. The World Bank functions as the global coordinator of \nthe ICP while the Asian Development Bank (ADB) served as the regional implementing agency \n(RIA) of the ICP in Asia and the Pacific since the 2005 ICP, with financing provided through \nADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA) program.1 The impact, outcome, outputs, and activities under \nthe TA are provided in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Until now, the ICP has been implemented for irregular benchmark years, with the last \nthree rounds conducted in 1993, 2005, and 2011. Extrapolation techniques were used for \nestimating  the  PPPs  for  non-benchmark  years.  However,  extrapolating  PPPs  has  been \nproblematic when benchmark years are spaced far apart, as the approach implicitly assumes \nthat internationally comparable price indexes evolve identically to the national price indexes \nused  for  extrapolation.  Comparability  problems  also  arise  on  account  of  methodological \nchanges in computing PPPs across ICP benchmark years. Tackling these issues requires more \nfrequent ICP benchmark rounds and a relatively consistent methodology for generating PPPs. \n \n5.  In response to increasing demand from stakeholders to make PPPs available in a more \nfrequent, timely, and consistent manner, the UNSC endorsed the ICP global comparison to \nbecome a permanent element of the global statistical work program during its 47th session held \nin March 2016. The UNSC also endorsed a shortened interval between ICP benchmark rounds \nas recommended by the Friends of the Chair group on the evaluation of the 2011 round of the \n                                                \n1  For the 2005 and 2011 benchmark ICP, the following agencies were the regional coordinating agencies: the \nAfrican Development Bank for Africa, ADB for Asia and the Pacific, the Interstate Statistical Committee of the \nCommonwealth of Independent States for the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Economic Commission \nfor Latin America and the Caribbean for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Economic Commission for West \nAsia for West Asia. The Statistical Office of the European Communities is responsible for the ICP activities in \nEuropean  countries,  and  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  for  non-European \ncountries of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries. They will remain as \ncoordinating agencies for the ICP 2017 round as well.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 August 2016. \n ", "2 \nICP.  In  particular,  the  next  benchmark  round  is  proposed  to  be  conducted  in  2017,  with \nsubsequent  benchmark  rounds  to  be  conducted  every  3  years.3 These  improvements  are \nexpected to address the main issues encountered in the previous ICP benchmark rounds. \n \n6.  The  expanded  geographic  coverage  (from  146  to  199  countries),  methodological \nimprovements,  and  strengthened  capacity  of  national  statistical  systems  in  compiling  price \nstatistics and national accounts brought higher acceptability of the 2011 ICP round among \ncountries compared with earlier benchmark rounds. However, outstanding methodological and \nadministrative issues still remain as challenges to be addressed in future ICP rounds. \n \n7.  Addressing  methodological  challenges  will  remain  an  integral  part  of  the  research \nagenda of future ICP rounds. Examples of these challenges include country-specific limitations \nof housing expenditures (rental) and government compensation data, comparison of prices of \ncomparison-resistant  services  (such  as  education  and  health),  expansion  of  the  overlap \nbetween the ICP and consumer price index baskets in order to reduce the burden on countries \nto collect price data, and the need for a more consistent and reliable breakdown of GDP \nexpenditure for basic headings under household and non-household sectors. Resolving these \nchallenges will require greater alignment of ICP activities with national statistical programs and \nthe statistics capacity building efforts of RIAs of the ICP, including ADB. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the 2017 ICP for Asia and the Pacific will be the enhanced utilization of \ncomparable macroeconomic statistics in policy making and research. The outcome will be \nimproved comparability of macroeconomic aggregates for the economies in Asia and the Pacific. \nPotential performance targets include (i) the collection of prices for at least 30% of the ICP items \nwithin each basic heading by each participating economy, and (ii) the availability of a PPP and \nGDP expenditure database for 2017 for all participating economies.4 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  This  TA  intends  to  support  the  next  round  of  the  ICP  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  by \ncoordinating all activities related to the collection of prices and the calculation of PPPs and \nrelated  aggregates  for  participating  economies.  It  is  expected  that  22  developing  member \neconomies (DMEs) that were part of ICP 2011 will also be part of the next ICP round in 2017.5 \nTo estimate the PPPs, the ICP requires undertaking (i) price collection surveys of a large \nnumber  of  household  and  non-household  items  that  are  comparable  based  on  structured \nproduct descriptions across participating economies, and (ii) a breakdown of the national GDP \n                                                \n3  United Nations, Economic and Social Council. 2016. Statistical Commission: Report on the Forty-Seventh Session \n(8\u201311 March 2016). http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/47th-session/documents/Report-on-the-47th-session-of-the-\nstatistical-commission-E.pdf. \n4  Basic headings are the lowest level of aggregation of items in the GDP breakdown for which expenditure data are \navailable. For example, prices will be collected for about 21 varieties of rice, and the expenditures across all rice \nvarieties will be aggregated under the basic heading \u201crice.\u201d \n5  There were 23 participating economies in ICP 2011: Bangladesh; Bhutan; Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; Fiji; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; \nMacau, China; Malaysia; the Maldives; Mongolia; Myanmar; Nepal; Pakistan; the Philippines; Singapore; Sri \nLanka; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam. An informal communication was sent to the chief statisticians of \nthese economies to seek their expressions of interest in participating in the TA. Nineteen economies have already \nexpressed their interest in participating in the 2017 ICP round, while Macau, China (the only non-member \neconomy) has expressed inability to join the 2017 ICP round. Assistance to Brunei Darussalam; Hong Kong, \nChina; Singapore; and Taipei,China will be provided on a reimbursable basis. \n ", "3 \ninto 155 basic headings as per the ICP classification of goods and services. The TA outputs are \n(i) ICP survey tools are produced, (ii) ICP knowledge products delivered, and (iii) statistical \ncapacity  of  participating  staff  of  national  statistics  offices  on  prices  and  national  accounts \nstatistics is further strengthened. \n \n10.  The UNSC also recommended gradually adopting a flexible rolling benchmark approach \nfor estimating the PPPs, with price collection surveys of household products spread over a cycle \nof 3 years. However, the rolling survey approach will require good quality and comparable \ndisaggregated  price  indexes  for  extrapolation.  Therefore,  for  regions  with  less  scope  for \nextrapolation, flexibility has been provided to implement the 2017 ICP as a regular benchmark \nround. Asia and the Pacific and most other developing regions will be implementing the 2017 \nICP as a regular benchmark survey. The UNSC has also recommended aligning the ICP and \nconsumer price index surveys more closely to (i) reduce the burden on countries, and (ii) link \nthe ICP activities to enhance statistical capacity for monitoring the Sustainable Development \nGoals. \n \n11.  To achieve the desired outcome, the TA will follow three major activities: (i) setup of the \ngovernance framework; (ii) pre-survey preparations; and (iii) data collection and validation, PPP \ncomputation, and output dissemination. \n \n12.  Setup of the governance framework. Based on the successful governance framework \nof the 2011 ICP round, the following arrangements will be made: \n(i)  Partnership with the participating DMEs. ADB will continue its partnership with DMEs by \noutlining the roles of both the national statistics offices (as NIAs) and ADB (as RIA and \nmember of the interagency coordination group) through the framework of partnership with \nthe NIAs, as was done in the 2011 ICP round. \n(ii) Regional Advisory Board. ADB will establish a Regional Advisory Board (RAB) comprising \nselected  heads  of  NIAs  and  development  partners.  As  the  policy  making  body  for \nimplementing  the  ICP  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  RAB  would  regularly  review  the \nimplementation  of  the  TA  in  participating  DMEs  and  provide  advice  for  improving  TA \nprocesses and outputs. \n(iii) Global ICP Unit. ADB will collaborate with the Global ICP Unit at the World Bank for (a) \ncoherent and integrated implementation of work related to the ICP across Asia and the \nPacific, and (b) conformity of the standard concepts and methods of this global exercise. \n(iv) Governing board and interagency coordination group. At the global level, a governing \nboard comprising 11 selected countries (including 2 countries from Asia and the Pacific) and \n5 development partners will be established by the United Nations Statistics Division, which \nfunctions as the Secretariat to the UNSC. The governing board will be a strategic body that \ntackles strategy, funding, political support, and outreach issues, and also endorses the \npolicies and protocols to which regional and global PPP calculation will adhere. ADB will be \na member of the ICP governing board on a rotating basis. ADB will also be a member of the \ninteragency  coordination  group  comprising  all  RIAs  that  will  be  jointly  responsible  for \ndetermining  data  collection,  validation,  calculation  and  dissemination  work  plans,  and \ncapacity building activities. \n \n13.  Pre-survey preparations. These cover (i) updating of the ICP product catalogs, (ii) the \nformulation of ICP guidelines and operations materials, and (iii) the conduct of regional inception \nand preparatory workshops. \n \n14.  Product catalogs will be developed for household and non-household sectors through \nthe collective efforts of participating economies, ADB, and the Global ICP Unit. Asia and the \nPacific  product  catalogs  will  include  (i)  regional  lists  reflecting  the  intercountry  diversity  of \n ", "4 \nconsumption patterns within Asia and the Pacific, and (ii) the global core lists of household and \nnon-household products that will be used to link the regional PPPs with the other regions. \nAppropriate  sampling  designs  necessary  to  collect  nationally  representative  data  will  be \nprepared and finalized by each economy in close consultation with ADB prior to price collection. \n \n15.  Data collection and validation, PPP computation, and output dissemination. DMEs \nwill conduct price surveys in accordance with the NIAs\u2019 approved sampling design and price \ncollection methods. DMEs in Asia and the Pacific will be required to submit pre-validated prices, \nincluding quality parameters like coefficients of variation of prices and the number of price \nquotations every quarter to ADB. They will also be required to submit GDP expenditures for the \n155 basic headings. Participating economies will use the ICP Asia and the Pacific Software \nSuite\u2013a tool for data entry, data validation, and data submission. While the participating DMEs \nhave experience in implementing ICP activities, the lack of timely implementation of the survey \nschedule or turnover of trained staff may affect the TA project\u2019s schedule of activities.6 \n \n16.  Intra and intercountry data review and validation will be conducted periodically to ensure \ncomparability and reliability of information. Workshops will be conducted to develop and sustain \neach NIA\u2019s technical knowledge of the ICP concepts, methods, and tools. GDP expenditures will \nbe  validated  following  international  standards of  national  accounts  statistics. The  validated \nprices  and  GDP  expenditure  data  will  be  used  to  calculate  PPPs  for  GDP  and  its  major \naggregates and the required levels of aggregation. Regional PPP calculations will follow, to the \nextent possible, the recommended methodology across regions and in consultation with the \nGlobal ICP Unit at the World Bank. Preliminary and final PPPs and PPP-based indicators \nestimated by ADB will be analyzed and discussed with the NIAs, World Bank experts, and RAB \nmembers, as deemed necessary. Preliminary and final regional PPPs, and other information \nagreed to be shared for the estimation of the global PPPs will be submitted to the Global ICP \nUnit of the World Bank for the preparation of the 2017 ICP global report. \n \n17.  The TA will use several avenues to disseminate good practices and lessons: (i) regional \nworkshops where DMEs share experiences and discuss issues related to data validation and \nquality, (ii) articles in the ICP newsletter regularly published by the World Bank, (iii) regional \ncoordinators' meetings organized by the World Bank, (iv) working papers, and (v) the ICP web \npage on the ADB website. \n \n18.  The regional results for Asia and the Pacific will be presented in a concluding workshop. \nThe final regional report, which will be titled \u201c2017 International Comparison Program for Asia \nand  the  Pacific:  Purchasing  Power  Parities  and  Real  Expenditures,\u201d will  be  produced  and \ndisseminated in print and online on ADB\u2019s website, and on the websites of other regional and \ninternational organizations.7 Advocacy work and related research on ICP will be conducted to \nadvance  the  participating  DMEs\u2019  capacities  and  enhance the  usefulness  and relevance  of \nproject outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). Appendix 2 presents the cost estimates \nand financing plan. \n \n                                                \n6  The GDP expenditure breakdown includes a component on gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) summarized by \ntype of assets. To improve the accuracy of GFCF estimates, the participating economies will be encouraged to \nprovide GFCF estimates by type of assets for the following groups: general government, public corporations, \nprivate corporations, and households. A set of technical guidelines on GFCF estimation will be prepared. \n7  Appendix 4 provides the outline of the final report.  \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency and will serve as the implementing agency of the ICP \nprogram in Asia and the Pacific. ADB\u2019s Development Economics and Indicators Division of the \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department will be responsible for the overall \nmanagement of regional data collection, data validation, data analysis, calculation of PPPs, and \nmaintenance of ICP data and the ICP web page on ADB\u2019s website.  \n \n21.  As in the previous ICP rounds, the national statistics offices in the DMEs will be the NIAs \nto implement the ICP at the national level, conduct price surveys and data collection, undertake \nintra-country  price  data  validations  and quality  assessment,  and  prepare GDP  expenditure \nvalues and participate in data validation workshops for finalizing the data for estimating the \nregional PPPs. DME governments will sign letters of no objection to confirm their participation in \nthe 2017 ICP round.  \n \n22.  Each participating economy will be required to identify a national coordinator, a deputy \nnational  coordinator,  and  an  ICP  country  team  that  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nactivities  identified  in  the  regional  program.  Periodic  reviews  of  survey  progress  will  be \nundertaken by the ADB project team, and necessary interventions in the form of technical and \noperational  advice  will  be  provided  to  the  participating  economies  on  an  ongoing  basis. \nQuarterly regional data review and validation workshops with project staff of all NIAs will be \nundertaken to review data collection and validation issues. These implementation arrangements \nwere used in the 2005 and 2011 ICP benchmark rounds and resulted in improved data quality \nand  comparability.  The  participating  economies  have  also  gained  sufficient  experience  in \ncarrying out data collection surveys and compiling other data needed for calculation of the PPPs. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented from November 2016 to December 2019  and finance 41 \nperson-months of consulting services comprising 4 person-months of international consultant \ninputs (in areas of sampling design, PPP methodology, national accounts statistics, and report \nwriting), and 37 person-months of national consultant inputs (as a statistician or economist, data \nspecialist, and manuscript editor). All consultants will be selected on an individual basis and \nengaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Lump-sum  payments  and  output-based  contracts  will  be \nconsidered for consulting services in line with Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 Action Plan Nos. \n2.9.2  and  2.10.2,  where  applicable8 The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3. The procurement of equipment and the handover of procured computer software \nand hardware to the governments of participating DMEs upon completion of the TA will follow \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Equipment purchased \nwill comply with ADB guidelines on accountability of assets purchased under the TA, and \ndisposal  will  follow  the  procedures  as  per  relevant  project  administration  instructions. \nDisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor the 2017 International Comparison Program for Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.
