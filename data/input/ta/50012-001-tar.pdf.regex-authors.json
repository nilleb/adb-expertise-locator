INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming mission in February 2016, the Government of Mongolia \nasked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide capacity building technical assistance (TA) \nto address issues related to the conservation of forest genetic resources (FGRs). The TA is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2016  for  Mongolia.1 ADB  fielded  a \nreconnaissance mission to Ulaanbaatar on 21 April 2016 and held a discussion with the Forest \nPolicy and Coordination Department of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), the \nexecuting agency, on the TA project\u2019s expected impact, outcome, outputs, scope, rationale, cost \nestimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements.2 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The TA project will support the government in implementing its forest laws and policies, \nparticularly the implementation of the Law on Forest,3 as well as the State Policy on Forest.4 \nIncreasing the forest cover to preserve the natural landscape and biodiversity in a sustainable \nway is a key objective of the State Policy on Forest. The Law on Forest stipulates to use only \nFGRs from officially approved sources in appropriate forest seed zones for artificial regeneration. \nThis requires developing legal frameworks for access to and certification of FGRs. The TA \nproject will support the government in developing FGR-related decrees and building capacity in \nFGR management. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Mongolia has a unique natural landscape and biodiversity with valuable FGRs. FGRs \nare the heritable materials maintained within and among tree species that are of economic, \nenvironmental, scientific, or societal value. They are crucial to the adaptation and protection of \nMongolia\u2019s ecosystems, landscapes, and production systems, yet are subject to increasing \npressures  and  unsustainable  use.  Climate  change  and  other  anthropogenic  factors  are \ndecreasing forest cover. Climate models indicate that temperatures will continue to rise, and \nmore than 80% of the country\u2019s territory is defined as highly vulnerable to climate extremes.5 \nClimate-related  disasters  with  high  social  and  economic  costs,  including  droughts,  severe \nstorms, and flash floods, have doubled in frequency since 1997. In forest ecosystems, the main \nclimate change impact is decreasing forest cover due to the expansion of the steppe and the \ndesert. \n \n4.  A  lack  of  FGR  conservation  strategies,  especially  a  forest  seed  selection  and \nconservation strategy, has resulted in FGR degradation in Mongolia. National and subnational \nstrategies are critical missing pieces for Mongolia\u2019s conservation of FGRs and their sustainable \nuse. Strategies for the development of a forest seed conservation business plan is needed to \nsupport the conservation of key FGRs and their evolutionary abilities for the future. Defining and \nimplementing conservation strategies provides a good justification for coordinating, collaborating, \nand making cost-effective investments in conserving forest seeds. The TA project will develop \nnational and subnational strategies, policy tools, and standards for the conservation of forest \nseeds and their sustainable use. \n \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2016.

Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n ", "2     \n5.  Sustainable forest regeneration depends on the appropriate selection and use of high-\nquality seeds for different forest vegetation regions. Mongolia can be divided into three forest \nvegetation regions: Central Asia, mountain range, and south. Since 2012, forest management \nline agencies (forest units) have established permanent forest seed collection sites with funding \nsupport from the government. The purpose of these sites is to prepare high-quality forest seeds \nfor forestation. Due to funding and human resources capacity constraints, the government has \nnot been able to take the required steps for the development of a forest seed development \nbusiness model. The TA project will identify sustainable forest seed plantations (forest seed \nstands) to supply high-quality forest seeds for forest regeneration purposes and strengthen \nforest staff capacity in required forest seed selection techniques. \n \n6.  Increasing the forest-covered area through forest restoration and afforestation requires an \nincreasing  quantity  and  quality  of  selected  FGRs  for  seedling  preparation.  Selection  and \ncertification  of  FGRs  in  registered  forest  seed  stands  is  an  important  means  for  in  situ \nconservation and propagation of adapted and resilient forest seeds for forest seedling preparation \nand plantation. \n \n7.  The lack of trained personnel is a major impediment to developing and implementing \nFGR strategies and projects. Capacity building is crucial to  providing the skills needed  to \nmanage FGRs. The projects of two other development partners, the Government of the Czech \nRepublic 6  and  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit, also contribute to the development of FGRs by providing a \nrelated  policy  and  legal-administrative  framework.7 The  TA  project  can  therefore  build  on \nachievements in this area and will implement complementary activities. \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be an increase in the resilience of forest ecosystems to climate change. \nThe outcome will be the improved management of forest seed stands. The TA project will \nassess and identify forest seed stands in natural forests and develop proposals for necessary \ngovernment decrees for the establishment of forest seed stands. The TA project will focus on \ncapacity-building activities with concerned stakeholders on all aspects of forest seed stand \nmanagement. A key TA performance indicator is the implementation of a national registry on \nforest seed stands by the MET (Appendix 1). The national registry on forest seed stands will \ndefine the required data for seed stands, selection criteria for approval, and process of approval \nof seed sources. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA project will deliver three main outputs: (i) identification of forest seed stands \nwithin forest regions of Mongolia, (ii) development of national registry on forest seed stands, and \n(iii) establishment and strengthening of educational and research capacities on FGRs. Potential \nrisks involved in delivering the outputs of this TA include the following: (i) natural disasters may \ndestroy forest seed stands or seeds in storage, and (ii) public and private stakeholders lack \nincentives and understanding of the capacity-building needs on forest genetic resources. \n                                                \n6  Government of the Czech Republic. 2015.

This \noutput  focuses  on  the  identification  of  high-quality  seed  stands  for  the  purpose  of  forest \nregeneration. To achieve this output, the following key activities are anticipated: (i) develop a \nwork plan for the rapid assessment of forest seed stands in the forest areas of Mongolia; (ii) \nassess and identify high-quality forest seed stands, including for their resilience to climate \nchange, for conifer trees and broad-leaved trees in three forest vegetation regions; (iii) analyze \nforest seed stands data and prepare a scientific publication of the findings on forest seed \nregions; (iv) register and publish seed stand site locations for conservation; (v) assess seed \nyields and the quality of identified seed stands; (vi) develop a framework and guidelines to \nassess forest yields for an MET booklet; (vii) review and update forest seed collection criteria; \n(viii) review and update instructions on seed tree climbing for seed collection; (ix) develop a \nmanual on tree seed management based on an updated forest seed collection criteria and seed \ntree climbing instructions; and (x) develop a manual on tree nursery management based on an \nassessment of tree nursery practices (seedling processing, storage, and outplanting) in three \naimags (provinces) in Mongolia: Khentii, Khuvsgul, and Selenge.8 \n \n11.  Output 2: National registry on forest seed stands developed. This output focuses on \ndeveloping proposals for government decrees and guidelines on the improved management of \nforest seed stands. Activities to achieve this output include the following: (i) conduct a field study \nin three aimags (Khentii, Khuvsgul, and Selenge) to identify constraints, opportunities, and \ncapacity gaps for the conservation of forest seeds; (ii) review and update a proposal for a \nnational registry on forest seed stands; (iii) review and update a proposal for a national standard \nfor  the  establishment  of  permanent  and  impermanent  forest  seed  stands;  (iv)  register \npermanent forest seed collection sites and collection seeds; and (v) develop a program for the \nconservation of forest seed genetic resources in seed storage facilities. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Educational  and  research  capacities  on  forest  genetic  resources \nestablished and strengthened. This output will provide capacity building to provide adequate \ntechnical support to forest seed conservation programs. Training activities will target poverty-\nstricken local forest user groups. This will support project sustainability by providing poor and \nunemployed forest user group members with income-generation activities stemming from the \ncollection and selling of seeds. The following key activities will be conducted: (i) develop training \ncurricula and teaching materials for (a) seed passport certificate elaboration; (b) seed collection, \nincluding by seed tree climbing; (c) seed treatment, testing, and storage; (d) seed treatment for \nsowing; (e) tree nursery activities for different tree species and seedling production targets (e.g., \nage, dimensions); and (f) site-adapted use of forest seedlings within afforestation, reforestation, \nand enrichment plantation activities; (ii) develop, in consultation with the MET at the central and \naimag levels, training modules, training agendas, and a list of targeted participants for specific \ntraining programs; and (iii) conduct training in three aimags (Khentii, Khuvsgul, and Selenge) for \naimag  and  soum  (district)  forest  unit  employees,  rangers,  private  tree  nursery  company \nemployees,  and  forest  user  groups  on  (a)  seed  passport  certificate  elaboration;  (b)  seed \ncollection, including by seed tree climbing; (c) seed treatment, testing, and storage; (d) seed \ntreatment for sowing; (e) tree nursery activities for different tree species and seedling production \ntargets (e.g., age, dimensions); and (f) site-adapted use of forest seedlings within afforestation, \nreforestation, and enrichment plantation activities. \n \n                                                \n8 Planned submission of scientific publication to Forest Ecology and Management, a journal published by Elsevier. \n ", "4     \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, office supplies and \nequipment,  administrative  support, and  other  in-kind  contributions. The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.   The  Forest  Policy  and  Coordination  Department  of  the  MET  will  be  the  executing \nagency.  A  TA  management  office  will  be  established  to  coordinate  with  ADB,  providing \nguidance on TA implementation issues and ensuring intra- and interdepartmental coordination. \nThe MET will initiate the establishment of an interministerial project steering committee. The TA \nmanagement  office  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  operational  matters  among  ADB, \nconsultants, and government agencies. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented for 24 months from 1 December 2016 to 30 November 2018. \nThe  TA  will  require  6  person-months  of  international  and  60  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services and 10 person-days of international resource person inputs. For the national \nconsulting services, a consulting firm will be engaged using a simplified technical proposal and \nthe quality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Interest from \ninternational firms to provide only one international consultant to be associated with a national \nfirm is expected to be low. Therefore, the international consultant will be recruited through the \nindividual  consultant  selection  procedure.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).9 It is \nanticipated that the consultants will be mobilized during the first quarter of 2017. Appendix 3 \nprovides the outline terms of reference of consultants. TA funds will be disbursed following the \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  follow  the  standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB-\nadministered TA projects. ADB will carry out monitoring and review missions at the TA inception, \ninterim, and final phases. During these missions, ADB, the executing agency, the consultants, \nand stakeholders will review the TA technical progress and provide feedback to improve the TA. \nProgress will be measured against the targets and indicators in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference, and reported in TA progress \nreports. ADB and local experts will review the progress reports to provide additional feedback \nand guidance. All TA reports will be made available on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the \nConservation of Forest Genetic Resources, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n9  Lump-sum payments and/or output-based contracts will be considered under the TA in line with the Midterm \nReview action plan Nos. 2.9.2 and 2.10.2.
