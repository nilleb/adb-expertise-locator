THE PROPOSAL  \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Health \nSystem Enhancement Project. \n \n2.  The  project  will  contribute  to  the government\u2019s  development  objective  to  ensure  a \nhealthier nation by supporting the development of a more responsive and comprehensive primary \nhealth care (PHC) system in Sri Lanka. It will enhance planning and delivering of essential PHC \nto  geographically  and  socioeconomically  deprived  populations  of  Central,  North  Central, \nSabaragamuwa, and Uva provinces. The project will (i) help operationalize the government\u2019s \nPHC reform initiatives, (ii) improve underserved communities\u2019 access to primary health services, \nand (iii) address selected gaps in core public health capacities in line with the International Health \nRegulations (IHR).1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sri Lanka has made impressive gains in ensuring access and quality to health services \nfor all. Life expectancy at birth increased to 75 years in 2015 from 70 in 1990.2 Maternal mortality \nreduced from 75 to 30 per 100,000 live births and infant mortality from 17.9 to 8.0 per 1,000 live \nbirths during the same period.3 Sri Lanka has achieved these efficiently with low overall health \nspending at 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).4 Most vaccine preventable diseases are at \nnear elimination stage with immunization coverage at more than 99%.5 Sri Lanka has been polio-\nfree since 1994, and malaria- and filariasis-free since 2016.     \n \n4.  Although  Sri  Lanka  made  significant  improvements  in  health  outcomes  during  the \nMillennium Development Goals period (1990 to 2015), it is now facing new health challenges \nrelated to population aging, changing disease pattern, economic and social changes, and \nchanging lifestyles. These dynamics have resulted in a dramatic increase in noncommunicable \ndiseases (NCDs), which are causing a surge in demand for health services and an increase in \nhealth care costs while reemerging and emerging communicable diseases remain a threat. \nDisparities in health outcomes, health-seeking behavior, life expectancy, and disease burden \nremain in lagging geographic areas especially in rural and estate sector populations, e.g., \nmalnutrition in mothers and children is a persistent health issue and more acutely seen in the \n                                                \n1  World Health Organization (WHO). 2005.

WHO Global Health Expenditure Database. Government health spending is also low at 1.9% of GDP, \nwith most of the out-of-pocket spending borne by the higher wealth quintiles and partly because of strong preventive \nservices available universally. \n5  Government of Sri Lanka; Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine (MOHNIM); Medical Statistics Unit. \n2015. Annual Health Bulletin 2015. Colombo. \n \n \n ", "2   \nestate  sector.6  The  country  is  now  more  exposed  to  communicable  diseases  because  of \nincreased labor mobility and connectivity. Sustaining control of vaccine preventable diseases, \nmalaria  elimination  efforts,  and  containment  of  global  diseases  will  require  continuous \ninvestments in the prevention and control of communicable diseases and disease surveillance in \nSri Lanka.  \n \n5.  Primary health care delivery system. The public PHC system in Sri Lanka has been \ninstrumental in providing universal comprehensive care at no cost to the population at the point \nof service delivery. One of the most characteristic features of the system is preventive health \ncare services focusing on communicable diseases control and maternal and child care. The \npreventive health system covers 341 geographic areas, each with a population of about 60,000. \nEach area is managed by a medical officer of health and served by 5\u201310 field health centers with \nmidwives, public health inspectors, and preventive health care staff. In parallel, there is an \nextensive network of curative services in three tiers of care (955 PHC hospitals and dispensaries, \nand 149 secondary and tertiary health care hospitals). The government health sector provides \nas much as 90% of inpatient care, nearly 100% of preventive care, and 50% of outpatient care \n(footnote 5). At present, the health system planning, policy, and stewardship functions are \ncentrally managed while management of primary and most secondary health care services is \ndecentralized to provincial governments.7  \n \n6.  Constraints. Since 1990, changing health challenges and population aging have led to \nprioritized  investments  for  secondary  and  tertiary  health  care  services  at  the  expense  of \ninvestments for primary curative and preventive care services. Deterioration of PHC facilities led \nto bypassing of primary curative care services for secondary and tertiary care for most health \nproblems faced by the population. For example, secondary and tertiary health care today \nmanage as much as 93% of childbirths, 75% of NCD patients, and 50% of outpatient services \n(footnote 5). On the preventive side, the medical officers of health continue to provide antenatal \ncare, nutrition, and immunization services. However, the quality of services decreased because \nof lower investments (about 4.5% of public health spending), inadequate staffing, and other \nresource constraints. Expanded outreach and interventions for populations living in vulnerable \nand lagging areas are also hampered. Preventive health care services are limited to mothers and \nchildren and village environments. There is a need to expand the target group to include the total \npopulation (children, youth, adult men and women, and elderly) and expand coverage of NCDs.8    \n \n7.  Government initiatives. The Government of Sri Lanka is reprioritizing PHC in line with \nits national health policy and strategic master plan.9 Sector reforms aim to establish a more \nresponsive, patient-centered, and person-focused health care system. The system will enable \nhealth seekers to access a comprehensive package of essential health services including \nfinancial  risk  protection.  The  government\u2019s  most  recent  policy  on  health  care  delivery  for \nuniversal health coverage provides the guiding framework to reform the existing PHC system.10 \n \n8.  The government is committed to develop a more comprehensive, accessible, and higher-\nquality PHC package to strengthen PHC services, reduce bypassing, and reach vulnerable \n                                                \n6  The estate sector consists of all plantations, such as for tea, rubber, and coconut, which are 20 acres or more and \nwith 10 or more resident laborers under a single administration. \n7  The line ministry directly manages selected base hospitals, teaching hospitals, and specialized tertiary care hospitals. \n8  NCDs and their risk factors (diet, high blood pressure, smoking, physical inactivity) are reaching 76% of the total \ndisease burden. \n9  Government of Sri Lanka, MOHNIM. 2016.

It  is  also  committed  to  implement  e-health  to  strengthen  evidence-based  health \nservices.11 This includes scaling up the introduction of a patient e-health card, connecting health \nservices for referral and better patient care, and improving information on diseases and health-\nseeking behavior using a geographic information system (GIS). The system will be linked to \ndisease  surveillance  for  national  health  security.  To  comply  with  international  standards \n(footnote 1),  the  government  aims  to  strengthen  the  health  assessment  of  migrants  and \nquarantine services at ports of entry (POEs). In support of efforts to strengthen PHC and the \ndigital health information system, policy developments  are in preparation for the  essential \nservices  package,  health  human  resources,  family  medicine,  facility  norms,  and  testing \ninnovative  approaches  to  strengthen  PHC.  Capacity  building  will  also  be  implemented  in \nmanagement,  e-health,  quarantine  and  health  security,  procurement,  accounting,  gender, \nnutrition, and health care waste management.  \n \n9.  Value added by ADB assistance.12 Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance brings \nvalue by (i) supporting equity-focused health care delivery reform especially in rural areas and \nthe  estate  sector  which  are  lagging  in  socioeconomic  and  health  indicators;  (ii)  adopting \nevidence-based planning based on GIS mapping13 and vulnerability index14 to identify and target \nunderserved districts and populations; (iii) enhancing infrastructure design to address climate \nchange and disaster risk resilience; (iv) scaling up e-health card and its integration with the \ngovernment\u2019s web-based health information system to improve continuity of care and disease \nsurveillance; (v) supporting GIS units in central and district planning departments to improve \ndisease surveillance and monitor health-seeking behavior; (vi) institutionalizing distance learning \nfor training PHC staff; and (vii) helping districts develop and implement innovative solutions to \nintegrate and improve PHC services.  \n \n10.  Link to national development strategy and ADB sector priority. The project aligns \nwith the government\u2019s priorities identified in the Public Investment Programme, 2017\u20132020 and \nVision 2025, and with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 on universal health \ncoverage.15 The project is in line with the objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Sri \nLanka to promote inclusiveness.16 \n \n11.  ADB experience and lessons learned. The project is ADB\u2019s reentry to the health sector \nin Sri Lanka after a gap of about 20 years. ADB\u2019s previous projects in the health sector were in \ngeneral successfully implemented.17 These past experiences and the project preparation process \nindicate  strong  commitment  by  the  government  at  the  national  and  regional  levels.

Development coordination. MOHNIM convened the donor coordination committee to \nensure collaboration with and among development partners. The World Health Organization \n(WHO) has a leading role in policy development and sector coordination. The project will \ncollaborate with WHO in terms of technical assistance to support selected areas related to the \nessential services package, health system strengthening, human resource development, and \nhealth security. The project also intends to work with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF) and the World Food Programme on nutrition, as well as the International Organization \nfor Migration on migrant issues. ADB\u2019s support will be coordinated with the World Bank program \nsupport to strengthen PHC, and regular discussions are held to prevent duplication of efforts and \nto synergize on the results and outcomes. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  Sri Lanka\u2019s overarching development objective is a healthier nation that contributes to its \neconomic, social, mental, and spiritual development.18 The project is aligned with the following \nimpact: a healthier nation is ensured with a more comprehensive PHC system. The project will \nhave  the  following  outcome:  efficiency,  equity,  and  responsiveness  of  the  PHC  system \nimproved.19   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The  project  has  three  outputs:  (i)  PHC  enhanced  in  Central,  North  Central, \nSabaragamuwa, and Uva provinces; (ii) health information system and disease surveillance \ncapacity strengthened; and (iii) policy development, capacity building, and project management \nsupported.  \n \n15.  Output 1: Primary health care enhanced in Central, North Central, Sabaragamuwa, \nand Uva provinces.20 Output 1 covers four sets of activities: (i) upgraded curative services, \n(ii) improved preventive services, (iii) public awareness to use PHC, and (iv) tested models for \nimproving PHC.21   \n \n16.  First, the project will upgrade and rehabilitate 135 curative PHC facilities (primary medical \ncare units and divisional hospitals) in the four provinces, supporting equipment for improving \nlaboratory, emergency treatment, dental, and NCD-related clinical services. Second, the project \nwill (i) renovate and refurbish one field health center for preventive health for each of the 127 \nmedical officers of health in the four provinces, (ii) provide medical equipment for these centers, \n(iii) conduct staff training in nutrition counseling, and (iv) design community health and nutrition \npromotion. Third, the project will improve health-seeking behavior to use PHC by developing a \ncommunication strategy and implementing a communication campaign, which will include staff \ntraining, health promotion materials, and outreach activities. The campaign will inform and \nencourage the community, adult men, and other groups to seek preventive and curative care at \n                                                \n18 Government of Sri Lanka, MOHNIM.

Finally, the project will support testing models whereby provincial and \nregional health staff propose and implement strategies to improve PHC under a PHC innovation \nfund. In the final years of project implementation, successful initiatives will be incorporated as \nnational reforms to improve PHC services in Sri Lanka.  \n \n17.  Output  2:  Health  information  system  and  disease  surveillance  capacity \nstrengthened. Output 2 covers two sets of activities: (i) health information technology for better \ncontinuity of care and disease surveillance, and (ii) implementation of IHR recommendations for \nPOEs and inbound health assessment services.  \n \n18.  First, the project will strengthen the medical information system to provide real-time \nsharing of health information vertically and horizontally across health facilities and across \ndifferent episodes of patient care. This will help enhance the referral system and quality of patient \ncare, and establish a system of continuity of care for health seekers. The enhanced information \nsystem will include disease surveillance and GIS mapping functionalities for timely reporting of \nthe 28 notifiable diseases of Sri Lanka to enhance health security. To improve PHC, overall \nsector efficiency, and reduce duplications in service delivery, the medical information system will \nlink primary-level curative facilities to higher-level hospitals to track and refer patients. Second, \nthe project will implement IHR recommendations to strengthen core capacities for POEs and \ninbound health assessment by (i) providing equipment required to meet core capacity levels at \nall eight POEs, (ii) enhancing the mobility of the quarantine unit at two designated ports in Sri \nLanka, (iii) strengthening the web-based surveillance system for notifiable diseases managed by \nthe quarantine unit, (iv) providing support for training health personnel on using the quarantine \nmanual, surveillance, and vector control; and (v) supporting the review and development of \ninbound assessment guidelines for the new inbound migrant screening facility. \n \n19.  Output  3:  Policy  development,  capacity  building,  and  project  management \nsupported. Output 3 will support policy and strategy development for comprehensive PHC and \ncontinuum of care, especially for vulnerable groups living in plantations, and with priority to \nnutrition. The project will provide  strategic support in the form of consulting services and \nworkshops for policy initiatives of MOHNIM, including (i) the development of essential health \nservices package for NCDs and emergency services, (ii) the development of clusters to explore \nstrategies  for  strengthening  PHC  using  funding  under  the  PHC  innovation  fund,  and \n(iii) personnel workforce planning. Output 3 will also support MOHNIM with capacity building for \nnutrition and health promotion, cluster planning and management, and training in procurement \nand  financial  management.  The  project  will  also  support  central  and  provincial  project \nmanagement and coordination, operating the project management unit (PMU) and project \nimplementation units (PIUs), implementing the gender action plan, monitoring environmental and \nsocial safeguards, establishing a project planning and results monitoring system, and conducting \nbaseline and endline surveys.   \n \nD.

Procurement (including consulting \nservices) to be financed by ADB will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 December 2018\u201330 November 2023 \nEstimated completion date   30 November 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 May 2024 \nManagement  \n(i) Oversight body  National project steering committee chaired by the MOHNIM secretary \n(ii) Executing agency  MOHNIM  \n(iii) Key implementing  Provincial councils of Central, North Central, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva \nagencies  provinces \n(iii) Implementation units   PMU under MOHNIM and PIUs under the four provincial councils  \nProcurement   OCB (civil works)  19 contracts  $16.95 million \nRFQ (civil works)  2 contracts  $4.77 million \nOCB (medical equipment,  14 contracts  $12.28 million \ncomputers, furniture, vehicles) \nRFQ (office equipment,  9 contracts  $0.59 million \nmedical equipment, \ncomputers, furniture) \nConsulting services   OCB (QCBS/CQS)  5 contracts   $3.07 million \nICS (14 persons)  349 person-months   $0.42 million \nRetroactive financing and  MOHNIM has requested advance contracting to (i) recruit PMU and PIU staff; \nadvance contracting   (ii) recruit a procurement expert; (iii) procure equipment; and (iv) procure \nvehicles, office equipment, and furniture.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  Economic analysis. Overall, the project is economically viable with an estimated internal \nrate of return of 14% and a net present value of $42.9 million. The economic benefits include \n(i) the direct benefit for project beneficiaries in health care cost savings, and (ii) productivity gains \nin terms of disability-adjusted life years averted. The main economic costs include (i) investment \ncosts, such as construction and upgrading of health facilities and purchase of equipment; \n(ii) indirect project-related costs, such as maintaining and replacing capital investments; and \n(iii) operational costs, such as wages and utilities required to run health facilities. Additionally, \neconomic benefits of health interventions accrue overtime; improved population health can lead \nto increased productivity and GDP growth in the long run.  ", "8   \n26.  Financial sustainability. Financial sustainability of the project depends on the ability of \nMOHNIM to allocate sufficient budget overtime and efficiency gains in the health sector. While \nthe government is undergoing macroeconomic reforms because of its sizeable public debt, it is \nexpected to continue its commitment to the health sector as indicated under Vision 2025 \n(footnote 15) and to prioritize the health sector through adequate budget support. The project \nannual commitment over 5 years is only 0.8% of the total health sector budget (MOHNIM and \nprovinces) for 2018 and to extend the project 1 year beyond the project period would require only \n0.3% of total health sector budget for 2018. As provided in the draft loan agreement, the \ngovernment will ensure adequate funds towards operations and maintenance of project facilities \nwill be provided to MOHNIM during and after project implementation. MOHNIM\u2019s budget has also \nbeen increasing in absolute terms since 2014 and is expected to continue its upward trend; the \nhealth budget increased by 26.5% from 2014 to 2015 and by 34.2% from 2015 to 2016. \nMOHNIM\u2019s recurrent budget (69.6%) is also higher than the capital budget (30.4%) in 2016, \nindicating government financial commitment to maintain capital investments. Efficiency gains are \nexpected across the sector because of PHC reform initiatives, which will shift management of \nexpensive NCDs from secondary to primary levels and encourage long-term cost containment. \nThis will increase the fiscal space for health in the long run and encourage more efficient and \noptimal use of existing resources in the health sector. \n \nB.  Governance  \n \n27.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  conducted  for  the \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement risk is substantial. The key risks identified are (i) delay in release of fund from \ndifferent fund sources, (ii) MOHNIM not familiar with ADB procedures, and (iii) limited resource \nin  internal  audit.  To  mitigate  these  risks:  (i)  cost-sharing  arrangements  will  be  avoided, \n(ii) capacity building support will be provided to PMU and PIU accounting staff, and (iii) internal \nauditor will be recruited. The borrower, executing agency, and implementing agencies have \nagreed to implement the risk mitigating measures identified in the financial management action \nplan of the PAM so that the overall financial management risk of the project will become moderate \n(footnote 22).  \n \n28.  Procurement. Procurement capacity and management risks at the central and provincial \nlevels are assessed as moderate. The common finding was that while the executing and \nimplementing agencies are well-versed with the national procurement guidelines and have \nexperience in implementing development partner-funded projects, they have limited experience \nwith ADB procurement practices. To mitigate this risk, the project will implement systematic \nprocurement training to augment staff capacity in procurement and compliance monitoring. The \nproject will also improve procurement transparency by setting up a project-specific webpage on \nthe MOHNIM website wherein contract information as well as information relating to procurement \nprocesses will be uploaded.  \n \n29.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and MOHNIM. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 22).  \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender  \n \n30.  Poverty in Sri Lanka is more relative than absolute; 4.1% of the country\u2019s population are \ndeemed to be below the national poverty line while the selected four provinces show higher \npoverty rates: Central (5.4%), Sabaragamuwa (6.7%), and Uva (6.5%)\u2014with North Central ", "9 \n \n \n(3.3%)  being  an  exception.25  Despite  following  a  path  of  inclusive  development,  regional \ndisparities remain, and are particularly evident in access, utilization, and service provision related \nto PHC. The country\u2019s changing epidemiological profile has presented a unique challenge to the \nexisting system of non-fee-based universal health care. Capitalizing on the country\u2019s extensive \nPHC network, the project will support poverty reduction and strengthen human capital through \nimprovements in both curative and preventive health care.  \n \n31.  The project has been classified effective gender mainstreaming because the project \noutputs are designed to advance both women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to health services and \ninfrastructure, which in turn will help promote gender equality. Some interventions include \ngender-responsive construction features (separate toilets, private examination and changing \nrooms); gender-responsive and inclusive essential service package; sex-disaggregated data in \nhealth information systems; and training for medical officers and PHC staff on gender sensitivity, \ngender-related policies, and interventions.  \n \nD.  Safeguards  \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. 26 \n \n33.  Environment (category B). The project will support minor renovations and expansion of \nPHC facilities as well as small repairs to field health centers. It is not expected to have any \nsignificant or irreversible adverse environmental impacts during either construction or operation. \nAny  environmental  risks  can  be  effectively  mitigated  through  the  adoption  of  appropriate \nmitigation measures specified in the environmental assessment and review framework. An initial \nenvironmental examination and an environment assessment and review framework have been \nprepared covering 45 primary medical care units and both documents were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 31 July 2018. The executing agency has adequate institutional capacity to carry out \nenvironmental safeguards and compliance measures, along with capacity development activities \nto manage related risks. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Civil works are limited to reconstruction and \nrefurbishment  of  existing  government  health  facilities,  which  does  not  necessitate  land \nacquisition and resettlement. No temporary involuntary resettlement impacts are anticipated. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Physical parameters of the project are confined to \nexisting health care facilities and do not include habitats and territories with indigenous peoples. \nProject activities will not affect traditional and sociocultural beliefs of indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan  \n \n36.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk mitigation plan.27  \n \n                                                \n25 Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics. 2017.
