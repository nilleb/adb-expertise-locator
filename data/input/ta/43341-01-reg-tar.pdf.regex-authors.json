INTRODUCTION \n1.  Promoting and sustaining mutual trade and economic cooperation is a key objective in \nSouth Asia. Since the signing of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement in 2004, \nsome progress in regional trade integration has been made in South Asia, such as an enhanced \nSAFTA, accelerated trade liberalization, and ongoing discussions for expansion of SAFTA to \nservices. Despite gradual economic reforms and preferential liberalization, intraregional trade in \nSouth Asia remains at 4.3% (2008)\u2014making it one of the world\u2019s least integrated regions. \nFurthermore, free trade agreement (FTA) activity is at an early stage, with little participation of \nleast-developed countries (LDCs). To bolster regional integration there is a need to move \nbeyond trade liberalization to identify specific behind-the-border impediments to integration in \nSouth Asia led by the private sector and improve the capacity of the private sector to facilitate \nsuch integration. \n \n2.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  support  capacity  building  for  implementing \nintegration in South Asia led by the private sector. The TA and its components have been \ndeveloped based on a series of consultations with several South Asian chambers of commerce \nand governments during 2008\u20132009.1 South Asian chambers of commerce have expressed the \nneed for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners to further support \nintegration in South Asia led by the private sector. A high-level conference was convened in \nNew Delhi on 17\u201318 November 2009 on Harnessing Business Opportunities for South Asian \nEconomic Integration.2 As a follow-up to this, it was also agreed that an ADB\u2013Federation of \nIndian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) working group would be formed to assist in \nthe implementation of this TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The private sector plays a crucial role in globalization through the vertical integration of \nproduction networks across countries, particularly in East Asia. Furthermore, private sector \nparticipation  has  catalyzed  integration  and  the  formation  of  economic  corridors  (e.g.,  the \nBusiness Forum for the Greater Mekong Subregion program). In South Asia, the private sector \nhas  also  begun  to  support  the  integration  process  within  the  South  Asian  Association  for \nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) and other initiatives for institutional cooperation. In 1994, the \nSAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established to promote private sector and \nregional trade and investment in the region by bringing together the national chambers of \ncommerce and industry of SAARC countries under one umbrella organization. These chambers \nof commerce are involved in policy dialogues with their respective governments and at the \nregional  level  through  the  SAARC  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry.  Chambers  of \ncommerce in South Asia (and particularly the FICCI) could play an important role in enhancing \nregional integration through, among other things, their ability to influence government policy \nmaking, particularly policies that will help improve the investment climate in the region.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Including ADB Office of Regional Economic Integration missions on 16\u201317 October 2008 and 23 March 2009, both \nin Colombo, Sri Lanka, and 13\u201316 May 2009 in Singapore.   \n2  Co-organized  by  the  Federation  of  Indian  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (FICCI),  the  South  Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Secretariat, Government of India Ministry of External Affairs, and \nADB, the conference brought together over 130 participants including several high-level government officials and \nprivate sector representatives from SAARC countries. The Indian external affairs minister, ADB\u2019s managing \ndirector general, and the SAARC secretary general, among others, gave keynote addresses.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 November 2010. \n ", "2  \n4.  While the FICCI in India and other bodies in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are influencing \npolicies, an initiative led by the private sector to promote South Asian integration is still at the \nnascent stage. Resource and capacity constraints affect business associations, particularly in \nsmaller economies or LDCs such as Afghanistan and Bhutan. Businesses, particularly small \nand medium-sized enterprises, lack the knowledge and capacity to compete and benefit from \nregional integration. The private sector still faces numerous barriers to business expansion, \nincluding visa restrictions that impede business travel, nontariff measures that increase the cost \nto trade, and transport connectivity and infrastructure that make the cross-border transit of \ngoods difficult\u2014the same barriers to intraregional trade and economic development in South \nAsia. \n \n5.  The  TA,  which  forms  part  of  ADB\u2019s  regional  cooperation  and  integration  strategy \n(particularly pillar 2 on trade and investments), will draw on ADB\u2019s experience in supporting FTA \nand  trade  policy  capacity  building  for  developing  member  countries  (DMCs),4 knowledge \noutputs, 5  and  existing  institutional  links  with  DMCs,  subregional  entities,  and  regional \ndevelopment partners. Specifically, it will build upon the recommendations of the TA Study on \nEconomic  Cooperation  Between  East  Asia  and  South  Asia,6 TA  on  Private  Sector-Led \nIntegration and Free Trade Agreements in South Asia,7 and the ADB\u2013FICCI issues paper on \nKey Proposals for Harnessing Business Opportunities in South Asia.8 \n \n6.  The activities and focus areas of the TA will be discussed with the DMCs concerned, the \nSAARC Secretariat, and chambers of commerce in South Asia, and will be coordinated and \nlinked to the extent possible with the activities of the Office of Regional Economic Integration \n(OREI) and regional cooperation and integration operations of ADB\u2019s South Asia Department \nand Central and West Asia Department.9 ADB is expected to work closely with the FICCI and \nother South Asian chambers of commerce as an effective channel to support and participate in \nthe official SAARC process.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The intended impact of the TA is strengthened private sector participation in the South \nAsian  integration  process.  The  envisaged  outcome  is  enhanced  institutional  and  human \ncapacity to implement integration in South Asia led by the private sector. It will also provide \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will identify and address the direct constraints facing the private sector and \nrecommend priority policies and activities to enable them to participate in cross-border trade \nand investment. Major assumptions include the adoption of market-friendly trade policies by \nSouth Asian governments, strong political commitment, cooperation of private sector groups, \nand sufficient staff resources. Political, economic, and social crises are some of the risks. \n \n9.  Output 1: Technical proposals to implement integration in South Asia led by the \nprivate sector. The TA will develop technical proposals on several key issues concerning trade \nfacilitation and other impediments to development and integration in South Asia led by the \nprivate sector. This component will draw on the ADB\u2013FICCI issues paper on Key Proposals for \nHarnessing Business Opportunities in South Asia (footnote 8). This component will also support \nthe development of new proposals as may be identified during the TA implementation. The \nadditional proposals are expected to focus on promoting an inclusive integration agenda for \nLDCs and pan-Asian integration. Inputs for the draft proposals will be sought from chambers in \nSouth Asian countries by bringing them together in a technical workshop (see output 2). At least \nfive technical proposals will be prepared and circulated to DMCs concerned.  \n \n10.  Drawing on the ADB\u2013FICCI issues paper, an ADB\u2013FICCI working group has recently \nbeen formed to make the case for enhancing integration in South Asia led by the private sector. \nThe working group comprises key representatives of national chambers of commerce and \nindustry in South Asia and ADB. The SAARC Secretariat, the SAARC Chamber of Commerce, \nand government representatives are invited to participate in the meetings as required. The \nworking group also works as a research and advocacy body to develop and advocate these \nproposals, prepare other issues papers, disseminate the findings through consultations with \nvarious stakeholders, and make presentations at relevant events. ADB plays a catalytic role by \nproviding  partial  financing  to  selected  activities  of  the  working  group,  and  assisting  with \ntechnical inputs and disseminating working group outputs. \n \n11.  Output 2: A technical workshop and a conference to present and discuss the \ntechnical proposals. The technical proposals will be widely disseminated through various ADB \nwebsites, conferences, and other appropriate forums. At least one technical workshop and a \nhigh-level conference will be organized under the TA in 2011\u20132013 to bring together the private \nsector and government representatives to deliberate on specific policy issues and actions to \nstimulate closer South Asian integration mentioned in output 1. To the extent possible, this \ncomponent will be implemented in collaboration and/or coordination with related activities of \nDMCs concerned, the SAARC Secretariat, chambers of commerce in South Asia, and ADB \nregional departments concerned. \n \n12.  The draft proposals will be presented in a technical workshop involving the private sector \nand government officials. The workshop will discuss the different proposals and develop an \naction plan. To promote ownership of these proposals, workshop participants will also continue \npolicy dialogues in their respective countries parallel to the SAARC-level policy processes. \nOnce the proposals are finalized, a high-level conference will be organized to bring together \nSouth Asian ministers, private sector representatives, and ADB to take forward the proposals \ninto national policy discussions and future project activities.  \n \n ", "4  \n13.  Output  3:  A  training  program  for  South  Asia  private  sector  associations  or \nchambers of business. Linked to the technical proposals, the training program will cover trade \npolicy tools and methods useful for mid-level analysts in business associations. This component \nwill  build  on  OREI\u2019s  FTA  policy  training  courses  (e.g.,  South  Asia  economic  integration: \nintroduction to concept, tools, and methods conducted in May 2009). The course will involve a \nmix of formal presentations, case studies, simulation, and practical group exercises on using \nADB\u2019s  FTA  and  trade  indicators  databases.  OREI  will  manage  the  training  courses  in \ncollaboration with regional partners as appropriate. Training will be conducted by ADB staff (and \nexperts). \n \n14.  Output 4: SAARC-wide firm-level survey on residual impediments to integration \nled by the private sector. The TA will aim to design a questionnaire and survey methodology \nand work on the implementation of the survey. This will draw from the experience of ADB firm-\nlevel surveys on the business impact of FTAs in East Asia.11 The survey will aim to initially cover \naround  300  firms  across  the  region  from  selected  priority  sectors,  and  conduct  in-depth \ninterviews as needed. If appropriate, a regional survey firm will be engaged to assist ADB staff \nin conducting the regionwide survey. \n \n15.  Output  5:  Technical  and  software  infrastructure  support.  A  small  grant  will  be \nallocated for the purchase of equipment and software (at least two personal computers and one \nserver with licensed software) to improve the capacity of chambers of commerce of LDCs in \nSouth  Asia.  This  will  enable  them  to  communicate  more  effectively,  promote  e-business, \nsupport the implementation of the TA (including to pilot test one of the technical proposals in \noutput 1 or support gathering of data for output 4), and improve the access of South Asian \nrecipients to ADB knowledge products and use of ADB integration and FTA databases.12 The \nequipment may be turned over to a selected agency or private sector association or chamber of \ncommerce upon completion of the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA will be financed with a grant from the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under \nthe Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility,13 to be administered by \nADB. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $680,000 equivalent which will cover remuneration, \ntravel,  and  per  diems  for  international  and  national  consultants,  ADB  staff,  and  resource \npersons;  cost  of  surveys;  workshops  and/or  conferences  expenditures;  travel  costs  and \nsubsistence allowances for selected DMC participants; publication of reports; communications; \nand miscellaneous expenses. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. Within ADB, OREI will implement the TA in \ncollaboration with regional departments (i.e., South Asia Department and Central and West Asia \nDepartment) and other offices (e.g., the Asian Development Bank Institute) to maximize synergy. \nADB will work closely with DMCs concerned and the private sector, and in particular with South \nAsian chambers of commerce (e.g., FICCI) involved in previous OREI activities for South Asia. \nThe focus areas and activities in relation to technical proposals, workshops or conferences, \ntraining programs, and firm-level surveys are expected to be developed in consultation with the \n                                                 \n11 Survey component of: ADB. 2006.

To the extent \npossible, the activities of the TA will draw on good practices and experience of private sector \nassociations and chambers of commerce in East Asia.  \n \n18.  The  TA  will  require  approximately  4  person-months  of  international  (individual, \nintermittent)  and  40  person-months  of  national  (individual,  intermittent)  consulting  services. \nAround six international consultants are to be engaged, with varied expertise in economic policy \nanalysis and business strategy. In addition, this TA will require 0.8 person-months (individual, \nintermittent) of international resource persons for the conferences and/or workshops to serve as \ndiscussants of the studies and technical proposals, prepare short papers as required, or deliver \nlectures for the TA\u2019s training program. Two national consultants, including a trade economist \nand a project coordinator who will be based at ADB headquarters, will be engaged for 40 \nperson-months to ensure coordination and consolidation of findings and recommendations of \nthe different outputs and trainings and to ensure effective TA implementation. The individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  Consulting requirements also include a surveying firm to be engaged for 3 person-\nmonths to conduct an enterprise-level survey (output 4). The firm will be selected under least-\ncost  selection.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  and  resource  persons  is  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n20.  At least two personal computers and one server with licensed software will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The \nequipment will be purchased through the Procurement and Contracts Administration Section of \nADB\u2019s Office of Administrative Services and will be assigned to private sector organizations or \nchambers of commerce based in LDCs as may be determined by ADB. Upon TA completion, \nthe equipment will be turned over to the user or users in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. A no-objection letter will be obtained prior to the commencement or financing of any \nundertaking in the territory of any country covered in this TA. The TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n21.  The  TA\u2019s  implementation  will  be  monitored  by  ADB  through  regular  submission  of \noutputs from consultants and conference and/or workshop participants. The TA\u2019s outputs, good \npractices, and lessons learned will be disseminated through ADB and Asia Regional Integration \nCenter websites,14 presented at regional and national forums, and published as international \nreports.  \n \n22.  The TA is expected to run for 36 months, from April 2011 to March 2014. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.
