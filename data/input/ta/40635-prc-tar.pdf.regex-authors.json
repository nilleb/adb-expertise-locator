During the Fact-Finding Mission of the Gansu Heihe Rural Hydropower Development \nInvestment Program in July 2006, the Gansu provincial government (GPG) asked the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  further  assistance  for  accelerated  development  of \nrenewable energy in Gansu, with a focus on rural clean energy development. During the 2006 \nCountry  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (the \nGovernment) formally requested inclusion of a technical assistance (TA) in the 2007 country \nprogram. The TA1 was discussed with the GPG and the Government and the TA was included \nfor assistance under the Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy \nEfficiency in Rural Areas. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Sustained economic growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is fueling demand \nfor  energy.  In  2006,  primary  energy  consumption  increased  by  9.3%  compared  with  the \nprevious year to 2.46 billion tons of standard coal equivalent. Coal is the dominant source of \nprimary energy, accounting for about 68.5% of total energy production in 2006. In the electricity \nsubsector  in  2006  consumption  increased  by  13.4%  compared  to  the  previous  year  to                \n2,834 terawatt-hours (TWh), with coal-fired power plants contributing more than 83% of the total. \nThe electricity sector is the major consumer of coal; in 2006 it used about 55% of total coal \nproduction, which that year reached 2.38 billion tons. Economic growth is expected to continue \nat an average of about 8% for the next 5\u201310 years. The energy sector is expected to continue to \ngrow with the economy. Despite impressive growth and achievements, the energy sector and \nthe electricity subsector face many challenges, which include the following.   \n \n(i)  Unbalanced energy mix with increasing dependence on coal. The PRC is \nthe world\u2019s largest producer and consumer of coal; production has more than \ndoubled in the last 5 years. Increasing coal consumption has resulted in local, \nregional and global environmental problems. About 90% of sulfur dioxide,85% of \n \ncarbon dioxide,67% of nitrogen oxide, and 80% of total fly ash emissions into the \n \natmosphere are due to coal burning. Acid rain falls on 40% of the total farmland.  \n(ii)  High energy intensity.2 Owing to high economic growth, energy intensity has \nbeen  increasing  since  2002.  Energy  efficiency  in  major  energy-consuming \nindustries is much lower than international best practice.  \n(iii)  Power  shortages.  Since 2001, the PRC has been facing power shortages, \nalthough these are likely to be overcome by the end of 2007 through increased \ncoal-fired power capacity. However, the greater challenge is to generate the \npower needed to quadruple the size of the economy by 2020. \n(iv)  Unreliable  power  supply  to  rural  areas. About 98% of the population has \naccess to electricity. Nevertheless, about 26 million people have no access. \nSupply is often unreliable and of poor quality in rural areas located at the end of \nthe distribution network.  \n(v)  Sub-optimal use of rural biomass energy sources. Large-scale agriculture is \naccompanied by large agro-based biomass, which is a clean-energy source for \nrural energy needs. However, agriculture biomass is often used inefficiently, or \nsimply burnt, thus causing further environmental problems.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 February 2007. \n2  The ratio of primary energy consumed per $1,000 of gross domestic product (GDP).  \n ", "2   \n3.  The  11th  Five-Year  Plan  2006\u20132010  (11FYP)  aims  for  a  resource-effective  and \nenvironment-friendly  society.  It  emphasizes  energy  efficiency  and  sets  a  target  of  a  20% \nreduction in energy intensity to achieve the overall goal of quadrupling the economy by 2020, \nwhile only doubling energy consumption. The Energy Conservation Law is being modified to \nreflect these Government priorities and to strengthen regulatory measures in order to promote \nenergy efficiency. The 11FYP also aims for a more diversified energy production mix with less \ndependence on coal, reducing the contribution of coal to 66%. The Renewable Energy Law was \nenacted  in  2006  to  accelerate  renewable  energy  development.  Regulations  on  tariffs  and \naccess  to  the  electricity  grid  were  issued  in  2006\u20132007.  The  development  of  local  and \ndistributed energy sources to provide access to electricity and meet rural energy needs is a key \ndevelopment priority in building a harmonious society and promoting rural development in an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner. The development of renewable energy sources is one of \nthe four energy priorities in the 11FYP. Small- and medium-sized hydropower development has \nbeen a core priority in expanding renewable energy. The 11FYP specifically targets accelerated \ndevelopment of wind power sources to achieve additional capacity of 5 gigawatt (GW) and \nbiomass power sources to add 5.5 GW. \n \n4.  Like  many  other  provinces,  Gansu  has  achieved  more  than  9.5%  average  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth in the last 3 years; electricity demand has grown by an average \nof 12% a year during the same period. This rapid growth in demand has been met mostly by \naddition of coal-fired power plants, which provided about 78.5% of electricity generation in 2006. \nIn addition to the heavy dependence on coal, the energy intensity levels in Gansu are also \nhigher than the national average. A combination of coal combustion and desertification causes \npoor air quality; 13 of Gansu\u2019s 14 cities do not meet acceptable standards. In rural areas, \nhousehold energy needs are primarily met by coal (40%), and stalk and firewood combustion \n(50%), which is polluting and inefficient. Total rural energy consumption in Gansu was about  \n8.6 million tons of standard coal in 2006. This is an average of about 398 kg per capita, which is \nonly 70% of the national average and lower than the level needed to meet the basic energy \nneeds. Owing to its geographic location and harsh climate, Gansu faces unique challenges in \nmeeting the energy needs of its rural population. About one third of the rural population lives in \nareas  with  significant  energy  shortages.  To  meet  its  growing  energy  needs  in  an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner, the GPG has identified promotion of clean and renewable \nenergy\u2014wind, hydropower and biomass\u2014as a key priority in the 11FYP.  \n \n5.  Biomass energy is widely distributed throughout the province and provides an excellent \nlocal energy source to meet rural needs. The GPG has promoted integrated rural energy \nresource  development  and  launched  297  demonstration  projects  in  the  10FYP;  another                \n300 demonstration projects will be implemented in the 11FYP. However, new approaches and \ntechnologies, together with innovative financing, need to be piloted for effective demonstration \nand  large-scale  replication.  The  GPG  has  also  successfully  installed  gasifiers  in                        \n2,300 households, and biogas digesters in 181,000 households (5% of rural households). The \nGPG  aims  to  further  increase  biomass  energy  development  but  faces  the  challenges  of                   \n(i)  limited  investments,  (ii)  old  and  inefficient  technology,  (iii)  lack  of  awareness,  and                      \n(iv) inadequate institutional capacity.  \n \n6.  Hydropower development has been steadily progressing but most of the unexploited \nhydropower resources are in medium-sized hydropower plants that are remote to the load \ncenters and so face implementation difficulties. The GPG is actively seeking private sector \nparticipation  in  hydropower  resource  development  and  has  a  structured  plan  to  increase \nhydropower production.  \n \n ", "  3\n7.  Gansu is rich in wind power resources3 and has launched initiatives to exploit this. \nThrough preliminary investigation and wind data measurements, GPG has identified about              \n17 priority wind power sites. It aims to set up 1 GW of wind power capacity during the 11FYP. \nAbout 300 megawatt (MW) of generating capacity is in the initial stages of construction. The \nGPG aims to accelerate wind power development through comprehensive medium-term plan \nbut it faces (i) limited financing, (ii) inadequate preparatory activities that may delay project \nimplementation, and (iii) lack of accurate wind data. There is a need to increase the planning, \npreparation, monitoring and control of the GPG\u2019s wind power development.  \n \n8.  The promotion of clean energy sources and improvement of energy efficiency are ADB\u2019s \nstrategic priorities in the sector. At the national level, ADB is assisting the Ministry of Agriculture \nin  developing  a  national  strategy  for  rural  biomass  energy  development.4 ADB  has  been \nsupporting Gansu province since 2002 to develop renewable energy sources to accelerate and \npromote  rural  growth.  This  includes  support  for  the  Heihe  river  cascade  hydropower \ndevelopment in Gansu, and successful pilot testing of an integrated 200 kW stalk gasifier and \npower generation plant in Qidian village of Zhangye city under a TA.5 This current TA is a logical \nnext  step  in  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  Gansu  province.  It  will  allow  for  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment through promotion of clean and renewable energy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be increased use of clean energy in rural areas of Gansu. The \noutcome of the TA will be enhanced capacity in planning and management of clean energy \ndevelopment in Gansu.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The outputs of the TA include (i) mapping of clean energy resources and a renewable \nenergy development plan (REDP) 2008\u20132012 for Gansu; (ii) identification and prefeasibility \nstudies  for  priority  clean  energy  investment  projects6 for  implementation;  (iii)  identification, \npreparation, and implementation of pilot biomass energy projects; (iv) capacity assessment and \nstrengthening of provincial and local agencies in clean energy planning and management; and \n(v) a publicity campaign to promote awareness of clean energy use and energy conservation in \nrural areas. \n \n11.  Close coordination with the GPG will be maintained during implementation of the TA to \nensure that it takes into account previous studies, government priorities, existing plans, and \nresults of pilot tests. Experts from the Ministry of Agriculture, Gansu Provincial Development \nand Reforms Commission (GPDRC), Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Animal \nHusbandry (GPDAAH), and research institutes will be consulted to (i) aid understanding of \ncurrent practices, priorities, and plans; and (ii) identify a suitable medium-term plan for the \n                                                 \n3  As identified in wind mapping of the PRC, Gansu is the fifth largest province in terms of wind power resources, \nwhich is estimated to be about 20 GW.   \n4  ADB. 2006.

Suitable criteria will be determined for the selection of \npriority projects and pilot or demonstration projects, and these will be endorsed by the GPG.  \n \n12.  The  consultant  recruited  for  the  TA  will  examine  international  best  practices  and \nmethods that can be used in the preparation of the REDP, summarize the features of the REDP \nand make recommendations. The essential and desirable features of the REDP will be listed at \nan early stage and a consensus will be built around these. When a preliminary structure and \noutline of the REDP is available, consultants will use the information from the demonstration \nand pilot projects to further refine and develop the REDP. A knowledge dissemination program \nwill be implemented before the TA is closed.  \n \n13.  The major assumptions in relation to the successful implementation of the TA include \n(i) continued emphasis on renewable energy and rural development, (ii) significant participation \nby counterpart staff, (iii) adequate and timely provision of data, and (iv) active participation in the \nconsultation workshops and seminars. Since the REDP will be a medium-term plan extending \nbeyond  the  11FYP,  the  risk  is  that  it  may  take  considerable  time  and  effort  to  achieve \nconsensus  on  its  design.  The  GPG  is  fully  committed  to  promoting  rapid  development  of \nrenewable energy, especially to meet rural energy needs. GPDAAH and GPDRC have been \nclosely involved in the development of policies and guidelines at the provincial level. Close \ncoordination among the consultants, GPG, GPDAAH, and ADB will be maintained during the \nimplementation of the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  will  be  $1,000,000  equivalent,  of  which  $800,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Denmark. This grant of $800,000 will be \nadministered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining $200,000 through in-kind \ncontribution, including office accommodation and support facilities,7 counterpart staff and data \nand other necessary information. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The  GPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  TA;  GPDAAH  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency  (IA),  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  TA  activities. \nGPDAAH  has  already  created  a  project  management  office  at  Lanzhou  for  the  TA \nimplementation. This office includes staff from the GPDRC to support the activities related to \nwind power.  \n \n16.  The TA will be supervised by Gansu Province Foreign Loan Administration Committee \n(the committee), which is already established in the province. The committee will interact closely \nwith the consultants and the IA during implementation of the TA. The EA will also submit regular \nreports of the progress of the TA implementation to the committee and seek its guidance as \nrequired.  \n \n17.  ADB will engage international and national consultants, according to its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A simplified technical proposal \nwill be requested by ADB and consultants will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based \n                                                 \n7  Some office equipment will be financed under the TA, and will be procured by the international consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and handed over to the IA \nupon completion of the TA. The counterpart in-kind contribution will be provided by the GPG or its assigned \nagency. \n ", "  5\nselection method with quality-cost ratio of 80:20. An estimated total of 40 person-months of \nconsulting  services  will  be  required:  10  person-months  for  international  consultants  and                \n30  person-months  for  national  consultants.  The  following  international  consultants  will  be \nrequired: (i) rural biomass energy expert and team leader, (ii) wind power expert, (iii) energy \neconomist, and (iv) financial analyst. The following national consultants will be required: (i) two \nrural renewable energy specialists, (ii) wind power specialist, (iii) energy economist, (iv) financial \nanalyst, (v) environment analyst, and (vi) social development specialist. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are given in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months beginning July 2007, with an expected \ncompletion date of end June 2008. Suitable pilot biomass energy projects that can fit within the \nTA scope will also be implemented. The consultants will be responsible for identification, design \nand  implementation  of  the  selected  pilot  projects.  An  advance  facility  will  be  provided  for \nconsultant to procure the goods and works for pilot projects. The TA implementation will involve \nextensive consultations with key stakeholders. The consultants will organize regular workshops, \nseminars and conferences to progressively seek stakeholders\u2019 views on TA recommendations. \nThe consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 4 weeks, (ii) an interim report within          \n12 weeks, (iii) a midterm report within 25 weeks, (iv) a draft final report within 38 weeks, and           \n(v) a final report within 44 weeks of the field mobilization. A provincial level workshop will be \norganized after the submission of each progress report to seek stakeholders\u2019 views on TA \noutputs.  \n \n19.  As part of the institutional capacity development, the consultants will recommend and \nimplement  training  workshops,  seminars  and  field  visits  for  local  and  provincial  staff  from \nrelevant agencies. During the initial stages of the TA implementation, a national study tour to \nother  provinces  in  the  PRC  will  be  finalized.  During  the  pilot  project  selection  phase,  the \nconsultants will also propose an international study tour to identify innovative approaches and \nmodern  technologies  for  pilot  testing.  The  training,  seminars  and  study  tours  will  be \nadministered under the TA by the consultants; an advance payment facility will be provided, \nespecially for international study tours. As part of the public information campaign for intensive \nclean energy use in rural areas, brochures will be developed by the consultants in English and \nChinese.  Local  and  provincial  workshops  and  seminars  for  disseminating  knowledge  and \nenhancing public awareness will be conducted by the IA. The TA funds for dissemination \nactivities will be administered by the IA; an advance payment facility will be provided. The \noutcome of the TA will be subject to evaluation by both ADB and the Government in accordance \nwith their respective evaluation policies and requirements.  \n \nIV.
