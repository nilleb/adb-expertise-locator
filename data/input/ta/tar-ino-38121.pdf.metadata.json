During  the  Country  Programming  Mission  2003,  confirmation  was  provided  by  the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  the  National  Secretariat  for  Regional  Cooperation.  ADB \nManagement  gave  the  TA  concept  clearance  in  September  2003.  Follow-up  consultations \nbetween the Government and ADB were held in April 2004. The two reached an understanding \non  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  terms  of  reference,  implementation  arrangements,  and  cost \nestimates.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  for  Indonesia  (2003\u20132005)  recognizes  that \nregional  cooperation  plays  an  important  role  in  increasing  growth  and  reducing  poverty. \nIndonesia currently participates actively in several major regional and subregional cooperation \ninitiatives, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Brunei Darussalam-\nIndonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), Indonesia-Malaysia-\nThailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT), and Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore Growth Triangle (IMS-\nGT). A technically strong and effective national institution at the central level dedicated to \nregional and subregional cooperation is essential to the success of the country\u2019s participation in \nthese activities. However, institutional capacity for that coordination remains weak in Indonesia, \nin terms of both technical skills and the necessary institutional framework.  \n \n3.  Indonesia\u2019s  large  area  and  population  make  coordination  particularly  challenging, \nespecially for subregional activities that involve regions that are distant from the capital. The \nthree subregional groupings listed in Para 2 all include subsets of provinces of Indonesia, and \nnone include Jakarta.  While various national agencies represent the Government in decision-\nmaking bodies of those groups, it is the provinces that are meant to participate most actively in \nand receive most benefits from their activities.  Coordination therefore involves work with both \nsectoral ministries in Jakarta and local governments, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nand businesses in the regions. \n \n4.  To support regional and subregional economic cooperation between Indonesia and other \ncountries, a Presidential decree was issued in January 2001, establishing an inter-ministerial \ncommittee  on  subregional  cooperation  headed  by  the  Coordinating  Minister  for  Economic \nAffairs.  The  main  responsibilities  of  the  committee  include,  among  others,  (i)  formulating \nnational  policies  for  regional  and  subregional  cooperation,  (ii)  providing  guidelines  for \nimplementing regional cooperation programs and projects, and (iii) working as the country\u2019s \nfocal point for coordinating regional cooperation activities at the national level. \n \n5.  The 2001 Presidential decree also stipulates the establishment of a National Secretariat \nfor Regional Cooperation (NSRC) located within the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs \n(CMEA) and reporting to the CMEA deputy minister responsible for investment.  The NSRC is \ntasked with day-to-day operational management of subregional activities, and other forms of \nsupport to the interministerial committee. However, progress in operationalizing the NSRC has \nbeen limited. Currently, only a small unit 2 within CMEA is functioning as a liaison office for \nsubregional cooperation, as part of its overall portfolio of coordinating the country\u2019s foreign \ninvestment policies. The institutional capacity of this unit falls far below the requirements of a \nfully functioning national secretariat for regional and subregional cooperation.  \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in June 2004.  \n2 Office of the Deputy Minister of CMEA for Investment and Public-Private Partnership, the Government of Indonesia. ", "2               \n \n6.  This weakness is reflected in three issues. \n  \n(i)  Limited area of responsibility. Currently, the CMEA unit is responsible only for \ncoordinating affairs for subregional cooperation in several subregional growth \narea  programs,  including  BIMP-EAGA,  IMT-GT,  and  IMS-GT.  Regional \ncooperation in a broader context, such as ASEAN initiatives and Asia Pacific \nEconomic Coordination (APEC) activities, falls beyond the unit\u2019s work portfolio. \nClose  coordination  of  all  regional  and  subregional  initiatives  is  essential,  as \ninconsistencies between their agendas and approaches would undermine both.  \nFor that reason, and also because subregional initiatives are seen as potential \ntest beds for regional initiatives, ASEAN is now paying renewed attention to \nsubregional cooperation.  \n \n(ii)  Insufficient staffing. There are only three full time staff members working in the \nNSRC, making it difficult to maintain regular contact with the national counterpart \nagencies  in  other  countries  and  monitor  the  developments  of  regional \ncooperation activities on a timely basis.  Such coordination work is highly labor- \nand time-intensive in a country as large as Indonesia.  For example, 14 provinces \nin Indonesia are currently included in the BIMP-EAGA program, accounting for \n56% of BIMP-EAGA\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and more than half of its \npopulation.  \n \n(iii)  Absence of strategic planning. In addition to the limited mandate of the unit, \nthere has been no serious effort to prepare a short- and medium-term regional \nand  subregional  cooperation  strategy  to  promote  cross-border  trade  and \ninvestment, and implement the prioritized programs and projects.   \n \n7.  Integration of subregional cooperation activities into national agendas, through effective \ncoordination among national and local agencies, has emerged as the greatest challenge to \nthese activities in Indonesia and elsewhere in the region.  At this time, as a result of the \nweaknesses listed above, Indonesia\u2019s coordinating activities are generally seen as lagging \nbehind those of other countries in the region. In the BIMP-EAGA program, for example, a \nnational secretariat of the Philippines, through the Mindanao Economic Development Council \n(MEDCO), was established as early as 1992 and became fully operational in 1996.3  Given \nIndonesia\u2019s size and involvement in all major subregional cooperation initiatives, Indonesia \nneeds to take the lead in establishing institutions and processes that make these initiatives \nsuccessful and productive. \n  \n8.  In October 2003 in Bali, Indonesia hosted the 9th ASEAN Summit, which called for the \nestablishment  of  an  ASEAN  Economic  Community  (AEC)  in  2020.4  This  more  ambitious \nregional integration agenda has intensified the pressure on the Government to take concrete \nsteps to strengthen its institutional capacity to participate in regional cooperation activities.  The \nestablishment of an effective NSRC will be the first step to help overcome the institutional \nconstraints to regional cooperation discussed above. The immediate need for support would be \nfocused on a clearer definition of the role, the strategy, and functions of the NSRC; its relations \nwith  other  government  agencies  involved  in  regional  and  subregional  cooperation;  and \n                                                 \n3 ADB has played a strong contributing role in enhancing the coordinating function of MEDCO by providing two \ntechnical assistance projects at a combined amount of $600,000 during 1996-2002.  \n4 ASEAN Secretariat, Declaration of ASEAN Concord II (Bali Concord II), October 2003. ", "3 \ndetermining its staffing and resource requirements.  A number of pressing questions need to be \naddressed  in  undertaking  such  a  review,  including  the  proper  location  of  coordination \nresponsibilities for activities occurring in other parts of the country and the most effective way to \nmaintain consistency among all regional and subregional initiatives.  The review will also identify \nother obstacles that are hindering Indonesia\u2019s effective participation in regional and subregional \nactivities: for example, the size of the area participating in BIMP-EAGA may be too large to be \nmanageable, and the impact of Indonesia\u2019s decentralization in the last 4 years may also be \ncausing difficulties.   \n \n9.  One key challenge confronting all regional and subregional initiatives in Southeast Asia \ntoday is effective follow-up on agreements reached in periodic summits or forums where senior \nnational representatives gather.  There seems to be a weakness in day-to-day regional project \nimplementation capacity in much of the region, including Indonesia, as most attention is devoted \nto organizing meetings, leaving few resources for project implementation and monitoring.   \n \n10.  As the principal supplier of TA to BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT over the last decade, ADB \nhas considerable experience and credibility as a source of assistance. 5   A number of lessons \nlearned during those years are relevant to this TA.  They include the importance of active \nparticipation by stakeholders in the subregions; the need to focus on project implementation \nprocesses and not only on logistical matters related to the holding of meetings; the need for \nprivate  sector  involvement,  and  for  establishment  of  an  effective  voice  for  private  sector \nrepresentatives; and the need to institutionalize systems so that they can continue after key \npersonnel change.   \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to provide expert assistance with clarifying and strengthening \nthe Government of Indonesia\u2019s national coordinating mechanism for regional and subregional \ncoordination, with emphasis on building capacity and developing procedures for effective, timely \nproject implementation.  The TA will also provide a reliable channel for active involvement at the \ncentral level of sectoral agencies and local stakeholders including local government agencies \nand business councils. ADB will build on its experience and lessons from its past capacity-\nbuilding support to national and regional institutions for regional cooperation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will include consultation among the interministerial committee on subregional \ncooperation, the NSRC, and other stakeholders, to analyze the current state of coordination. \nBased on analysis of that and related issues, an agreement will be proposed on the most \nproductive role for the NSRC, following which a plan for developing the institutional capacity of \nthe NSRC to accomplish its mandates and objectives will be formulated and implementation \nstarted.   \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2002.

The purpose of the TA will be pursued by (i) assessing the gaps in policy formulation, \nproject identification and management, and resource mobilization for regional and subregional \nactivities;  (ii)  improving  coordination  with  regional/provincial  agencies  for  regional  and \nsubregional cooperation programs;6 (iii) improving coordination with other national government \nagencies  that  frequently  participate  in  regional  and  subregional  cooperation  programs;  (iv) \nenhancing project/program formulation and implementation for regional cooperation operations; \n(v) strengthening monitoring mechanisms for regional cooperation projects; (vi) assisting to build \na national information system for regional and subregional cooperation databases; and (vii) \nhelping develop the capacity to facilitate stakeholders\u2019 participation in regional and subregional \ncooperation activities, particularly in partnerships among the public sector, business community, \nand civil society. \n \n14.  The TA will execute the following key activities: (i) developing a sustainable NSRC with a \nstrongly entrenched institutional role, capable of assisting the inter-ministerial committee to \nexecute  its  mandates,  particularly  with  respect  to  regional  cooperation;  (ii)  advising  on \ninstitutional strengthening to support regional cooperation; (iii) formulating a human resource \ndevelopment plan for the NSRC; (iv) extensive work with regional governments and NGOs that \nparticipate in regional and subregional cooperation activities, to determine their needs, identify \nobstacles to coordination, and build effective working relations between them and the NSRC; (v) \nextensive consultations with other national government agencies that are key players in regional \nand subregional cooperation activities \u2015 including, but not limited to, BAPPENAS, Ministry of \nForeign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure, Ministry \nof Communications, and Ministry of Trade and Industry \u2015 to build consensus on a new and \nmore effective coordination mechanism; (vi) enhanced program design and monitoring capacity \nof the NSRC for regional cooperation and improved project analysis, using case studies of \nregional cooperation projects in the region; (vii) seminars, training programs, and workshops for \nNSRC staff and for staff of other agencies and organizations that participate in regional and \nsubregional  activities;  and  (viii)  seminars  for  national  and  regional  officials  engaged  in \nsubregional cooperation initiatives, to assess current coordination and project implementation \npractices and build consensus on new and improved practices.  \n \n15.  Such TA activities will be specified in the work plan and the capacity-building plan for the \nNSRC that will be prepared during TA implementation. The consultants will consult extensively \nwith  national  and  local  agencies  and  organizations  that  participate in regional cooperation \nactivities.     \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $375,000 equivalent, of which $206,000 is in \nforeign exchange and $169,000 equivalent is in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $206,000 equivalent as well as $90,500 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. ADB will provide $296,500 equivalent on a grant basis \nfinanced by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Indonesian \nGovernment will finance the local currency costs of $78,500 by providing office space, staff \nsupport, and other items.  The TA cost estimates and budget are in Appendix 2.  \n                                                 \n6 This includes, but is not limited to, ASEAN activities, BIMP-EAGA, IMT-GT, and IMS-GT.  ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  CMEA will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  A steering committee chaired by the \ndesignated representative of CMEA, with members including, but not necessarily limited to, \nrepresentatives of BAPPENAS, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Finance, will be \nestablished and will meet bimonthly to review TA progress.  A TA implementation unit (TIU) will \nbe established within CMEA, and headed by the Director of the NSRC, who is to remain in place \nfor a minimum of 18 months. The TIU will consist of representatives of CMEA departments and \noffices that are responsible for regional and subregional cooperation. CMEA, through the TIU, \nwill closely collaborate with other relevant line ministries, and central and local agencies for \nregional cooperation and development. \n \n18.  TA  implementation  will  take  12  months  beginning  in  February  2005  and  ending  in \nJanuary  2006.  The  TA  requires  three  domestic  consultants  (19  person-months)  and  one \ninternational consultant (4 person-months). A domestic consultant/institutional expert will be the \nteam  leader,  and  will  be  supported  by  a  regional  cooperation  specialist  (international \nconsultant), a human resource development specialist (domestic), and an administrative and \nlegal expert (domestic).  The terms of references for consultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will \nrecruit the consultants individually in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The consultants \nwill undertake their assignments intermittently during the TA period. \n \n19.  CMEA  will  provide  logistics  and  support  including  liaison  with  the  consultants.  The \nGovernment has allocated necessary counterpart funding in its 2004 budget. Procurement of \nequipment and materials, and service payments under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \n20.  The team leader will prepare an inception report for the steering committee, CMEA, and \nADB within 1 month of the start of the TA services. The report will focus on an initial assessment \nand a plan for future actions to implement the TA.  An interim report will be submitted at the end \nof month 6. A draft final report will be submitted to the steering committee, CMEA, and ADB no \nlater than the end of month 11, and the final TA report, incorporating discussions of the draft, \nwill be submitted by the end of January 2006. \n \nIV.
