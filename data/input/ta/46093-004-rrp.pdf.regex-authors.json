THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the Inclusive Growth through \nImproved Connectivity Program.1 \n \n2.  Indonesia has recorded strong economic growth, averaging around 6% since 2007. \nDespite this achievement, several studies suggest that the economic growth is still below the \ncountry\u2019s potential. Indonesia also made significant strides in reducing poverty as its incidence \ndeclined from 16.6% in 2007 to 12% in 2012. At the same time, despite the declining poverty \nincidence, the country experienced a steady rise in inequality as shown by an increasing Gini \ncoefficient.  The  government\u2019s  Master  Plan  for  Acceleration  and  Expansion  of  Indonesia\u2019s \nEconomic  Development,  2011\u20132025  (MP3EI)  aims  to  achieve  higher  and  more  inclusive \neconomic growth based on a three-pillar strategy: (i) spreading economic development across \nthe  country  through  development  of  six  economic  corridors,  (ii)  improving  domestic  and \ninternational connectivity, and (iii) enhancing technology and human resources. The MP3EI \nincludes regulatory reforms as an integral initial step in accelerating economic development that \nADB could appropriately support through a policy-based loan. The proposed subprogram 2 will \nsupport the continuation of reforms achieved under the first subprogram on the second strategic \npillar of the MP3EI.2 The government has implemented further reforms aimed at improving the \npolicy, regulatory, financial, institutional, and business climate frameworks for connectivity and \ninfrastructure development. A stronger enabling environment for domestic and international \nconnectivity will in turn enable more infrastructure investments by the public and private sectors \nto support sustainable, higher, and more inclusive economic growth. Now, as economic growth \nhas started to slow down, there is increased urgency to advance implementation of these \nreforms to accelerate connectivity improvement and infrastructure development in general. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Indonesia\u2019s economic growth performance and infrastructure. After reaching 6.5% \nin 2011 (the highest since the Asian crisis 1997\u20131998), economic growth declined to 6.2% in \n2012 following the recession in the eurozone and lower growth in Indonesia\u2019s other key trading \npartners. Economic growth weakened further in the first quarter of 2013 due to slower than \nexpected recovery of demand for the country\u2019s exports. Given the slow recovery in the global \neconomy, the government now recognizes the need to accelerate infrastructure-related reforms \nand  investments  to  remove  the  obstacles  that  keep  the  country  from  reaching  its  growth \npotential.3 An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study highlights inadequacies in infrastructure as \na  critical  constraint  on  economic  growth.4 After  increasing  its  infrastructure  spending,  and \nimplementing reforms to support infrastructure development, Indonesia\u2019s global competitiveness \nindex ranking rose by 12 places to 38 in the 2013 Global Competitiveness Index.5 However, \nsignificant challenges remain. Although Indonesia\u2019s ranking on infrastructure has moved up by \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic \nApproach, Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram 1, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Indonesia for \nInclusive Growth through Improved Connectivity Program. Manila. \n3  For 2014\u20132016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had estimated a baseline potential growth rate of 7.1%, \nwhich would increase to 7.9% if infrastructure development and economic reforms were accelerated. \n4  H. Hill, M. E. Khan, and J. Zhuong, eds. 2012. Diagnosing the Indonesian Economy: Toward Inclusive and Green \nGrowth. London: Asian Development Bank / Anthem Press. \n5  World Economic Forum. 2013. Global Competitiveness Report, 2013\u20132014. Geneva. ", "2 \n17 places to 61, it is still much lower than the country\u2019s overall ranking of 38 out of 148 countries \n(Figure 1). The impact of lagging infrastructure still appears in a number of forms. Deteriorating \nroads in the provinces and districts increase domestic transport and logistics costs. Congested \nports  and  underdeveloped  interisland  transport  have  led  to  high  domestic  shipping  costs. \nCongested and underdeveloped international ports also limit a deeper integration of Indonesia\u2019s \nmanufacturing sector into international production networks.  \n \nFigure 1: Global Competitiveness Index Ranking  Figure 2: Poverty Incidence by Location, March 2013  \nfor Connectivity Infrastructure, 2013\u20132014   (% of population) \n(out of 148 countries) \n31.4 \nInfrastructure Overall\n96\nUrban  Rural   Urban and Rural 24.0 \n61 59 16.7 \n47 14.3 14.4  14.5  14.0 \n12.7 \n37 38 11.4 11.5 10.9  11.2  11.2 \n29 24 8.4 9.6 8.5  8.1 \n6.4  5.7  6.1 \n4.0 \n2 2\nSingapore Malaysia Thailand Indonesia Philippines   National Sumatra Jawa Bali and  Kalimantan Sulawesi Maluku and \n  Nusa  Papua\nTenggara  \n Source:  World  Economic  Forum.  2013.  Global  Source: Statistics Indonesia (BPS) website (accessed 3 \nCompetitiveness Report, 2013\u20132014  July 2013) \n \n4.  Poverty  reduction  and  inequality.  Despite  slightly  declining  growth  in  2012,  the \nunemployment rate declined from 6.3% in February 2012 to 5.9% in February 2013. The quality \nof employment also improved further thanks to a greater size of the economy's productive \nsector, illustrated by 3.5 million more jobs in the formal sector and 2.3 million fewer jobs in the \ninformal sector. This helped reduce the poverty rate to 11.4% in March 2013, from 12.0% in \nMarch 2012. However, formidable efforts are needed to reduce the poverty incidence further. \nThe share of the country\u2019s labor force employed in the informal sector, where wages and job \nsecurity are low, is still high at 60.0%. While the overall poverty rate has trended downward, \nachievement varies across the country as economic development is still centered in western \nIndonesia and in urban areas. The national rural poverty rate of 14.3% is much higher than the \nnational urban poverty rate of 8.4%. Poverty rates in some provinces in eastern Indonesia are \nmuch higher than elsewhere in the country\u2014e.g., 24.0% in Maluku and Papua (Figure 2). At the \nsame time, inequality was rising steadily until 2012, with the Gini coefficient reaching 0.41.  \n \n5.  Inclusive growth through better developed connectivity. Alleviating the country\u2019s \nmultidimensional poverty will require not only accelerated economic growth but also a more \ninclusive growth process that provides rural areas and disadvantaged regions with greater \neconomic opportunity and access to social services. Improving and developing the country\u2019s \nconnectivity is key to reducing the poverty incidence. First, improving intraisland connectivity \nbetween rural areas with regional growth poles will reduce rural poverty through lower transport \ncosts and widen access to markets and services. Second, improving connectivity between the \npoorer  eastern  parts  of  Indonesia  with  markets  in  western  areas  through  more  efficient \ninterisland transport systems will help reduce development gaps and poverty through increased \ndomestic trade and larger economic opportunities in the eastern provinces. Finally, improving \ninternational connectivity to boost the competitiveness of the country\u2019s tradable sector will help \ngenerate more productive jobs in the formal sector. Combined, these connectivity efforts are \n ", "3 \nexpected to have a key role in increasing access to and delivery of services, thereby enhancing \neconomic productivity and social well-being, and reducing the overall poverty incidence. \n \n6.  Convergence  of  government  national  strategies  and  ADB  strategy.  The \ngovernment recognizes that lagging infrastructure, underdeveloped intraisland and interisland \nconnectivity, weak international connectivity, and inefficient logistics constrain achievement of \nits medium- and long-term targets of higher growth and faster poverty reduction. The policy to \nreduce fuel subsidies introduced in June 2013 will provide significant fiscal space to support \nlarger infrastructure spending in 2014 and beyond. Strategically, the government\u2019s National \nMedium-Term Development Plan, 2010\u20132014 provides direction for the two pillars of ADB\u2019s \nIndonesia  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014:  inclusive  growth  and  environmental \nsustainability.6 Reforms assisted by the proposed program will support the inclusive growth pillar \nof the country partnership strategy. In addition, improving connectivity is a strategic focus of the \nMP3EI. The MP3EI will guide the convergence of ADB\u2019s policy-based, sector, and thematic \ninterventions  related  to  connectivity  and  the  government\u2019s  vision  of  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment.  \n  \n7.  Lessons  from  ADB  policy-based  loans  and  development  coordination.  Several \nlessons from the previous country strategy for Indonesia (2006\u20132009) and support for policy-\nbased loans were considered.7 Achieving tangible results with ADB\u2019s relatively modest program \nrequires  selective  support  targeting  key  government  priorities  and  use  of  programmatic \napproaches in coordination with other development partners. Specifically, ADB effectiveness \ncan be increased by (i) concentrating on a more limited set of program areas where there are \nclear synergies between ADB\u2019s policy, project, and private sector support, (ii) focusing on core \nsectors identified by Strategy 2020 and emphasizing sectors where ADB has a strong track \nrecord,8 and (iii) supporting operations where ADB can play a catalytic role with good prospects \nfor collaboration with other partners. The program will involve collaborative cofinancing with the \nWorld Bank and the Government of Japan. In addition, ADB coordinates with the Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  on  infrastructure  issues  through  its  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Initiative  Project  in  Indonesia  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Infrastructure \nAssistance  Program  technical  assistance  cluster,  which  is  financed  by  the  Government  of \nAustralia.9 This  connectivity-related  policy-based  loan  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  earlier  policy-based \nloans,  notably  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program,  which  supported \ngovernment reforms to improve regulatory frameworks; open up key infrastructure sectors for \nprivate sector participation, including public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs); increase competition; \nand improve infrastructure.10 A key lesson from ADB's experience is to simplify the program to \nfocus on high-impact policy reforms.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The program\u2019s impact will be to reduce transport and logistics costs, a key requirement \nfor achieving higher and more inclusive economic growth that is sustained over the medium \nterm. The outcome will be more developed domestic and international connectivity anchored on \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2012.

Outputs \n9.  The programmatic approach consists of two subprograms sequenced to support the \ngovernment\u2019s medium-term reforms to strengthen domestic and international connectivity. The \nproposed  policy-based  loan  will  support  subprogram  2.  The  overall  program  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  in  four  core  reform  areas:  (i) strengthening  national  coordination, \nregulatory, and institutional frameworks for more effective implementation of the connectivity \nagenda; (ii) strengthening intraisland connectivity to and from growth centers, with optimal use \nof resources for sustainable improvement and maintenance of land transportation and networks; \n(iii) improving interisland connectivity by stepping up efficiencies and service performance of \ndomestic air and sea transportation; and (iv) enhancing international connectivity by making \nIndonesia\u2019s ports more efficient in handling traffic and trade volume. The policy actions have \nbeen  developed  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  government\u2019s  development  efforts  and \ninitiatives, as outlined in the National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2010\u20132014 and the \nMP3EI, 2011\u20132025 (Appendix 4). After completing all policy actions under subprogram 1 in mid-\nSeptember 2012, the government has made significant progress in implementing  policy actions \nfor subprogram 2.11 Of the 11 policy actions originally envisaged for subprogram 2, ten have \nbeen completed.  The policy action related to the establishment of the new Indonesia National \nSingle  Window  (INSW)  agency  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  early  2014.  Three  more \nsignificant policy actions have been added into the policy matrix to reflect the government\u2019s \nreform priority.12  \n \n1.  Connectivity Coordination and Regulatory Frameworks Strengthened \n \n10.  The  policy  reforms  will  strengthen  coordination  across  institutions  and  harmonize \nregulations  related  to  connectivity  infrastructure  and  logistics.  While  the  government  has \nestablished working groups to coordinate and monitor implementation of the three pillars of the \nMP3EI  activities,  their  operational  effectiveness  has  been  constrained  by  an  ineffective \nmechanism for reaching collective decisions on priority infrastructure and by the lack of a \nbudget mechanism for financing project preparation.  \n \n11.  National  logistics  blueprint  and  debottlenecking  mechanism  for  priority \ninfrastructure. Under subprogram 1, the government issued a national logistics blueprint to \nspecify short- and medium-term reform targets. In support of the connectivity agenda, under \nsubprogram 2, the government has developed and operationalized a working team to monitor \nand evaluate the implementation of the national logistics blueprint. CMEA also established a \nmechanism to resolve issues that cause delay in the implementation of priority projects. \n \n12.  Policy  Committee  for  Acceleration  of  Priority  Infrastructure  Delivery.  The \ngovernment has identified various bottlenecks in the development of priority infrastructure. For \nPPPs, these include lack of coordination and capacity in preparing bankable projects to meet \ninternational standards. For infrastructure in general, the government is yet to develop a clear \nbudget mechanism for financing a pre-feasibility study in preparation of infrastructure projects. \nTo rectify these issues, CMEA has drafted a presidential decree aimed at revitalizing the Policy \n                                                \n11  Policy actions are policy triggers for the loan (noted in bold in the policy matrix [Appendix 4]). Policy milestones, while \nimportant in achieving the objectives of the program, are not policy triggers for the loan. They are presented to \ndemonstrate additional reforms implemented by the government. \n12  Appendix 4 shows all of the changes introduced into the policy matrix.  \n ", "5 \nCommittee  for  Acceleration  of  Priority  Infrastructure  Delivery  (KKPPI)  by  streamlining  its \nstructure and strengthening its function and its secretariat. With its revitalization, KKPPI is to \nfunction as a collective decision-making body for all stakeholders to (i) develop infrastructure \npolicy and priorities, (ii) coordinate implementation of a pre-feasibility study to determine which \ninfrastructure is to be financed by which sources (e.g., public sector, state-owned enterprises, \nprivate sector, public\u2013private partnerships, development partners); (iii) set standards for the \nquality of project preparation; and (iv) help remove bottlenecks in infrastructure development.  \n \n13.  Viability gap fund to support public\u2013private partnerships. Recognizing the limited \npublic resources available to meet the country\u2019s large financing needs for future infrastructure, \nthe  government  has  made  significant  efforts  to  attract  and  leverage  private  financing  of \ninfrastructure through PPPs. While some PPP projects are socially and economically desirable, \nthey are not always financially viable due to limited cost-recovery prospects through user fees or \ntariffs. This low degree of cost recovery has constrained private sector interest, underscoring \nthe need to close the financial viability gap with public resources. The government is setting up \na viability gap fund (VGF) to provide public financial support to well-prepared PPP projects and \nso boost their bankability and financial viability. Under subprogram 1, the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF)  prepared  a  draft  ministerial  decree  for  the  establishment  of  the  fund.  Under \nsubprogram 2,  MOF  issued  ministerial  decree  No.  223/PMK011/2012  on  implementation \nguidelines  for  the  VGF.  The  decree  specifies  clear  eligibility  criteria  for  VGF  support,  the \napproval  processes,  and  VGF  allocation  and  disbursement,  as  well  as  contractual  and \nmonitoring arrangements. In addition, MOF has drafted the framework and business process of \na PPP unit within the ministry. The PPP unit is expected to be developed into an anchor PPP \ncenter in the medium term to mainstream PPP implementation. \n \n2.  Intraisland Connectivity Upgraded \n \n14.  Improving intraisland connectivity is an important part of the government\u2019s connectivity \nstrategy  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  The  policy  reforms  will  support  its  efforts  to  accelerate \ndevelopment of transport systems and infrastructure to improve access from rural areas to the \nnearest growth centers and between industrial zones and ports. Linking rural areas with growth \ncenters  within  islands  is  constrained  by  inadequate  road  infrastructure,  delays  in  land \nacquisition, and substandard maintenance of the existing road network.  \n \n15.  Land acquisition. The difficulty in acquiring land for public use has been a key reason \nfor the late disbursement of the government\u2019s capital spending in the transport sector. The \nprivate sector considers the land acquisition problem a major source of uncertainty in project \ndevelopment, costs, and implementation, lowering investor confidence on the prospects for road \ninvestment. It also has delayed the development of PPPs, particularly for toll roads. Overcoming \nthis  constraint  is  key  to  advancing  the  connectivity  and  infrastructure  agenda.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the government achieved significant progress through the passage of the Land \nAcquisition Law for Public Use (Law No. 2/2012) and the issuance of Presidential Decree \nNo. 71/2012.  Subprogram  2  supports further  progress  in  this  area  by  the  issuance  of the \nMinister of Finance Regulation No. 13/PMK.02/2013, Minister of Home Affairs Regulation No. \n72/2012 , and the Head of National Land Agency Regulation No. 5/2012.  These final sets of \nregulatory framework provide guidelines for operational costs for land acquisition for public use \nand  its  implementation  by  local  governments.  The  new  regulatory  framework  reallocates \nresponsibilities  from  districts  and  provinces  to  BPN  to  ensure  a  more  consistent  national \napproach.  \n \n ", "6 \n16.  Performance-based contract and national road network. The Directorate General \nHighway within the Ministry of Public Works issued Circular No.06/SE/06/2012 recommending \nthe  use  of  performance-based  contracting  for  any  road  project  was  supported  under \nsubprogram  1. The  circular  provides  an  opportunity  to  mainstream  the  performance-based \ncontract  into  national  road  management  practices.  It  will  help  improve  road  preservation \nmanagement  by  phasing  out  the  force  account  approach  and  boost  efficiency  through \ncompetition. Directorate General Highway has expanded its implementation to three roads in \nCentral  Java  under  subprogram  2.  Directorate General  Highway  also  issued  a  circular  on \nmedium-term  national  network  to  support  the  implementation  of  road  connectivity  across \neconomic corridors under the MP3EI.  \n \n17.  Mechanism for allocation of grant funds to subnational governments. The public \nexpenditure review of the road sector by the World Bank finds that 24% of provincial roads and \n41% of district roads are in bad or poor condition.13 The performance is better for national roads, \nwhere only 12% are in bad or poor condition. To start tackling this problem, the government \nintroduced a pilot mechanism for reimbursable road maintenance in eastern Indonesia. Under it, \nthe national government will disburse road infrastructure grant funds to local governments only if \nthey meet pre-agreed road maintenance quality and performance standards. \n \n3.  Interisland Connectivity Improved \n \n18.  The  key  objectives  of  interisland  connectivity  reforms  are  to  strengthen  the  policy \nframework to step up port productivity and to improve transport access in eastern Indonesia. In \na  large,  archipelagic  country  with  a  dispersed  population,  reducing  the  cost  of  interisland \nshipping  is  expected  to  make  a  significant  contribution  to  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction by connecting islands through lower-cost and higher-volume trade and movement of \npeople. The high cost and low level of reliability of interisland shipping services are a major \nconstraint in the transportation of consumer goods to remote and often poor islands. These \ncontribute to higher and more volatile prices for consumer goods in remote provinces. Improving \ninterisland connectivity means reducing the cost of interisland cargo transportation and making \ntransportation more reliable. The government has increased the number of pioneer shipping \nservices and has started to upgrade the quality of ships servicing eastern Indonesia. \n \n19.  National port master plan. The Shipping Law No. 17/2008 marks the start of reforms \nwith the long-term objective of developing a competitive shipping industry to support domestic \nand international trade. The law includes a provision to issue a national port master plan to \nguide  implementation  of  reform  and  port  investment  across  the  country,  including  eastern \nIndonesia. The Ministry of Transport issued Decree No. 414/2013 which serves as the port \nnational master plan and will integrate development of economic corridors envisioned under the \nMP3EI and national transport and port systems. The master plan also includes port investment \nplans,  both  public  and  private,  and  also  covers  policies  to  support  improvements  in  port \noperation and efficiency.  \n \n4.  International Connectivity Enhanced \n \n20.  These reforms aim to improve regulatory certainty in customs clearance and reduce ship \ndwelling time. The bulk of the country\u2019s international trade is facilitated by five main ports. The \nlargest is Tanjung Priok, the country\u2019s main international gateway in Jakarta, serving about 70% \n                                                \n13 World  Bank.  2012.  Investing  in  Indonesia\u2019s  Roads:  Improving  Efficiency  and  Closing  the  Financing  Gap. \nWashington, DC.  \n ", "7 \nof internationally traded goods. Tanjung Priok also serves 29% of container traffic between Java \nand other islands. While Tanjung Priok is Indonesia\u2019s most efficient port, its productivity is much \nlower than that of major ports in Southeast Asia. Container dwelling time in Tanjung Priok was \n6.7 days in January 2012 compared with only 4.9 days in 2010. The cost of delivering one \ncontainer from Cikarang (the nearest industrial zone) to Tanjung Priok across a distance of \nabout 56 kilometers is $750, much higher than the cost of $450 across a similar distance in \nMalaysia (from Pasir Gudang to Tanjung Pelepas). The 2013 logistics performance index, which \nmeasures the efficiency of logistics services for international trade, confirms that Indonesia\u2019s \nperformance is much lower than that of neighboring countries due to lagging infrastructure \nefficiency.  \n \n21.  Indonesia National Single Window. Improving transparency in trade regulations is key \nto facilitating international trade. While efforts to simplify export and import procedures are \nongoing, the number of agencies and documents involved remains large. Thus, the INSW plays \nan important role in reducing the time and costs of importing and exporting by enabling single \nsubmission,  single  processing,  and  single  approval  of  import  and  export  documents. \nDevelopment of the INSW was conducted in stages, and so far 15 agencies and six major ports, \nwhich  together  represent  about  80%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total  international  trade  volume,  have \nimplemented the INSW. The single submission and sign-on systems are the final goals of the \nINSW. With those features, the INSW will significantly improve the efficiency of  the cargo \nclearance process, which will reduce costs for exporters and importers and in turn strengthen \nthe competitiveness in trade logistics. The government has incorporated the National Agency of \nDrug and Food Control, one of the major issuers of import and export permits, into the INSW \nsingle sign-on system. Under subprogram 2, two additional agencies, the Ministry of Trade and \nthe Ministry of Agriculture, have been added to the INSW single sign-on system. The function of \nthe INSW agency is still being performed by the Directorate General Customs. The government \nis in the process of developing a new institutional setup of the INSW, which is to be established \nin 2014. To reduce the dwelling time in Tanjung Priok port, the government has started the \noperation of Cikarang dry port. The expansion of the Tanjung Priok port is under way.  \n \n22.  Post-program  partnership  framework.  The  program  recognizes  that  achieving  its \nintended  outcome  will  require  a  coherent  medium-term  reform  strategy.  The  government\u2019s \nconnectivity reform agenda will continue beyond the completion of the triggers for subprogram 2 \nin  September  2013.  The  government  has  requested  that  ADB  remain  engaged  in  the \nconnectivity reforms. ADB and the government have developed a nonbinding post-program \npartnership framework to enable continuous dialogue and to guide the reform agenda from \n1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014. Under this framework, the government will continue its \nconnectivity  reform  by  focusing  on  making  KKPPI  operational,  improving  capacity  in \nimplementing the land acquisition regulations, implementing the VGF to support PPP projects, \nestablishing a PPP unit within the Ministry of Finance, and establishing a new agency to run the \nINSW. ADB will build capacity through technical assistance for Supporting Inclusive Growth \nthrough Better Connectivity.14 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n23.  The loan amount is based on the strengths of the policy package, its development \nimpact, the importance of the sectors covered, indicative costs of reform, and the government\u2019s \nresulting  financing  needs.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  accelerating  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  including  connectivity,  the  central  government  has  more  than  doubled  its \n                                                \n14  Attached to footnote 2 (TA 8215-INO). \n ", "8 \ninfrastructure spending since 2010 (Table 1). Implementation of some policy reforms in this area \n(such as revitalizing KKPPI, implementing land acquisition regulations, and operationalizing the \nVGF and performance-based contracts) requires adjustment costs. Effective implementation of \nconnectivity  reforms  will  also  require  capacity  improvements  at  related  agencies.  The \ngovernment has increased its annual budget allocation to improve transport operations and \nrelated infrastructure in eastern Indonesia. Despite the recent policy to reduce the fuel subsidy, \nthe government still needs to widen its 2013 budget deficit target from 1.6% of gross domestic \nproduct to 2.4% due to additional infrastructure spending and one-off compensation for the \npoor. As a result, government\u2019s net financing need is expected to increase to about $22 billion. \nCurrently, the government obtains over 75% of its financing needs from market sources. The \nongoing  financial  market  turbulence  has  caused  government  bond  yields  to  increase \nsignificantly. The government has requested a total of $1.1 billion in policy-based lending from \ndevelopment partners, of which $400 million is from ADB. The entire process of the policy \nbased-loan will be disbursed in a single tranche, upon satisfaction of the core policy action in \nthe policy matrix. \n \nTable 1: Government Financing Needs, 2010\u20132013 \n(Rp trillion) \n2012 Actual  2013 Revised \nItem  2010 Actual  2011 Actual  (unaudited)  Budget \nRevenues  995  1,211  1,336  1,502 \nExpenditures  1,042  1,295  1,482  1,726 \nCentral government, of which  697  884  1,001  1,197 \n  Material  98  125  137  203 \n  Capital  80  118  140  188 \nSurplus/deficit  (47)  (84)  (146)  (224) \nDeficit (% of GDP)  (0.7)  (1.1)  (1.8)  (2.4) \nNet financing  92  131  180  224 \n  Domestic financing  96  149  199  241 \n  Foreign financing  (4.6)  (17.8)  (19.2)  (16.9) \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \n24.  To support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a loan of $400 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a \n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity \npremium payable to ADB. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full exchange cost \n(excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed to Indonesia in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines  on  simplifying  disbursement  requirements  for  program  loans. 15  Collaborative \ncofinancing will be provided by the World Bank ($300 million), the Government of Japan ($200 \nmillion), and the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement ($100 million). ADB will provide support \non PPP, land acquisition, and KKPPI, while the World Bank will assist in the VGF, PPP center, \nand  logistics.  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement will focus on urban infrastructure, capacity building, and port development.  \n \n                                                \n15  ADB. 1998.

The program period for subprogram 2 is from October 2012 to September 2013. The \nNational  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The \nimplementing agencies will be the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of \nTransport,  Ministry  of  Communication  and  Information,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of \nTrade, National Land Agency, and CMEA. The government will form a steering committee, \nchaired by the vice-minister of BAPPENAS, with senior representatives of the implementing \nagencies  and  development  partners  (ADB,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank) as members. The committee will meet \nsemiannually to review and confirm attainment and compliance with policy actions and to \nprovide overall guidance on the implementation of the reform agenda under the program. The \ncommittee will work with the connectivity working group, which is also chaired by BAPPENAS \nand responsible for coordinating the implementation of the government\u2019s connectivity reform \nagenda under MP3EI.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The policy actions of the program are derived from the government\u2019s medium-term \nreform priorities, which are crucial in achieving the government\u2019s strategy of higher and more \ninclusive growth. Currently, with exports still slow to recover, investment will need to play a \nlarger role in supporting growth. The proposed reforms are expected to stimulate infrastructure \ninvestment, which could generate additional economic growth of up to one percentage point \nannually over the medium term.16 The proposed reforms will also help improve the quality of \nemployment by increasing employment opportunities in the formal sector and reduce poverty in \nthe rural areas and in the eastern Indonesia, where poverty incidence is much higher. Improved \nconnectivity will also lead to improvement in access to and delivery of services in the rural areas \nand in the eastern Indonesia. Combined, these will help reduce inequality over the medium \nterm.   \n \nB.  Governance \n27.  The government has made considerable progress in the legal and regulatory framework \nfor  public  financial  management.  Since  the  enactment  of  the  laws  on  state  finance,  state \ntreasury, and state audit in 2003\u20132004, most of the regulations underpinning the laws have \nbeen promulgated. In 2012, the number of government agencies that received unqualified audit \nopinion from the External Audit Agency increased to 65%, from about 40% in 2019. ADB \nreinforces this momentum with continuing support to improve technical capacity and controls. \nBuilding on previous programs, ADB technical assistance for Strengthening National Public \nProcurement Processes has been committed to boosting transparency and efficiency in public \nprocurement processes.17 As a result of the government\u2019s continuing commitment to reduce \ncorruption, the capacity of the Corruption Eradication Commission has improved markedly. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government.  \n \n                                                \n16 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Strengthening National Public Procurement \nProcesses. Manila.  \n ", "10 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The reforms supported under the program will accelerate economic growth and generate \nmore productive jobs, which are key to reducing poverty and reducing the risk of the employed \nlabor force falling back into poverty. The program will also promote better connectivity for rural \nareas and eastern Indonesia, which is expected to help expedite poverty reduction in these \nareas.18 Impact assessments of the program are expected to demonstrate the productivity-\nboosting and poverty-reducing effects of connectivity reforms and development.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n29.  The  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  classified  under \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  The three main risks to the program, rated low to medium, are (i) weak coordination in \nand between key government agencies; (ii) continued under disbursement of capital spending; \nand (iii) a rise in international fuel prices, which could divert government budgetary resources \nfrom capital investment to fuel subsidies. To mitigate risks (i) and (ii), the government has set up \na high-level task force for connectivity and tasked the President\u2019s delivery unit to monitor the \nprogress. For the third risk, the government has increased fuel prices by 44% for gasoline and \n22% for diesel in June 2013.19  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $400,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the Inclusive Growth \nthrough Improved Connectivity Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n5 November 2013 \n                                                \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risksa \nImpact      Assumption \nReduced transport  By 2016:    Macroeconomic \nand logistics costs   Lower share of transport and  BPS  stability maintained \nlogistics costs in the total cost of   \nRisk \nproduction by 5% (2012 baseline:   \nImplementation \n27%)   \ndelay due to \n  BPS \nregulatory and \nPoverty rate in rural and eastern \npolitical processes \nIndonesia decreasing more \nquickly (2012 baseline: 15.6% for \nrural poverty and 25.3% for \npoverty in Papua and Maluku) \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nBetter developed  By end 2013:    Government \ndomestic and    BPS and report from the  staying on course \ninternational  Increased share of public and  investment board  with its key \nconnectivity  private investments in the    structural reforms \ntransport sector (2012 baseline:   \n  Risk \n17%)   \nWeak coordination \n  BPS and other \nin government \nDwelling time in Tanjung Priok  independent surveys \nagencies \nport reduced to under 6 days \n(2011 baseline: 6.7 days)  Reform slowed by \n  vested interest \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
