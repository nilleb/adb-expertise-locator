The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been assisting the Government of Mongolia \n(the Government) to restructure its education system. During the Country Program Mission in \n2002, the Government asked ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Third \nEducation Development Project (TEDP). A fact-finding mission visited Mongolia in November \n2003  and  agreed  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  scope,  implementation  and  financing \narrangements, cost estimates and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference.1 Following elections and \nchange of Government, a confirmation mission was fielded in September 2004 to reconfirm the  \nTA  concept  and  to  adjust  and  update  the  TA\u2019s  outputs,  implementation  and  financing \narrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since termination of financial and technical support from the former Soviet Union in \n1991,  the  quality  of  and  access  to  the  education  services  in  Mongolia  has  deteriorated. \nMongolia had earlier achieved universal primary education, but following a sharp drop in the \nenrollment rate, re-attaining is a priority objective. The Government has prioritized education in \nnational development and allocated considerable state expenditure to the sector, even during a \nsevere  economic  recession.  However,  expenditure  on  education  has  reached  a  ceiling, \naveraging about 20% of total Government expenditures in 2000\u20132002. More than 70% of the \neducation budget is allocated to personnel salaries and heating costs. \n \n3.  Financial constraints have exacerbated the numerous problems in the education sector: \n(i) delays in updating the content of education to be responsive to the needs in the market \neconomy, (ii) limited capacities of the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture (MOECS) and \nlocal education authorities, (iii) high demand for new construction and rehabilitation of school \nfacilities, and the related problem of insufficient maintenance, (iv) lack of effective instructional \nmaterials, (v) irrelevant and outmoded technical education and vocational training (TEVT), (vi) \nresistance  to  introduction  of  cost-recovery  schemes  for  public  universities,  (vii)  limited \ninvolvement of the private sector in TEVT and higher education, and (viii) uneven budget \nallocations  among  subsectors.  Most  seriously,  the  widening  gap  in  learning  environments \nbetween urban and rural areas has greatly contributed to large-scale internal migration. The \npoverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP)2 and country strategy and program update3 have \npointed out that internal migration is the biggest obstacle to reducing poverty. Many rural \nparents see education as an investment in bettering the life of their children and move to urban \nareas  for  quality  schooling.  The  dearth  of  qualified  teachers  in  rural  schools  accelerates \nmigration to cities, where many schools are already too crowded. These migrants often join the \nurban poor. \n \n4.  ADB has been the major provider of assistance in the education sector since 1990. The \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Nordic Development Fund (NDF), and United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) also provide assistance to basic education; the European \nUnion, Korea International Cooperation Agency, and Soros Foundation to secondary and higher \neducation; and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), \nand UNICEF to early child care and education and nonformal education. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 23 January 2004. \n2  The Government of Mongolia. 2003. \u201cEconomic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy,\u201d agreed on in the \nMongolia Consultative Group Meeting held in Tokyo, Japan, on 19-21 November 2003.  \n3  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004-2006): Mongolia. Manila. \n ", "2  \n5.  In  1996,  ADB  approved  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (ESDP),4  an \nintegrated package including a policy reform program, investment project, and associated TA. \nThe ESDP\u2019s objective was to improve financial sustainability and upgrade educational facilities \nby reducing redundant staff and rehabilitating school buildings. The program also promoted a \ncost-sharing system for textbook printing and distribution, privatization of state universities, and \nprivate sector involvement in TEVT and higher education. Based on the achievements of the \nESDP, which was successfully completed in 2002, the Government prepared a comprehensive \neducation sector strategy (ESS) for 2001\u20132005, to improve access to basic education. The \nGovernment requested ADB for continued support through the Second Education Development \nProject (SEDP) approved in 2002.5 The SEDP, which is cofinanced by NDF, focuses on (i) \nschool  rehabilitation,  (ii)  provision  of  instructional  materials,  and  (iii)  capacity  building  of \nschoolteachers and administrators. Under the ESDP and SEDP, significant progress has been \nmade: 181 schools were successfully restructured under the ESDP, improving the efficiency of \neducation delivery and stabilizing education finance, and about 66 schools and kindergartens \nare being rehabilitated under the SEDP. \n \n6.  With  the  Government\u2019s  continued  commitment  and  extensive  external  assistance, \nsignificant progress has been made in restructuring the education sector. Enrollment in basic \neducation  is  recovering,  the  national  curriculum  and  standards  have  been  updated,  and \nteachers\u2019 average qualifications have been upgraded. However, further actions and reforms are \nurgently needed to address geographical inequities in learning environments and sub\u2013sectors \nother than basic education. One of the key issues to be resolved is the lack of an effective donor \ncoordination mechanism. The Government prepared the ongoing ESS assisted only by ADB; \nother donors\u2019 inputs were limited and focused mainly on project activities rather than the overall \npolicy dialogue with the Government. Under the ESS, a common understanding on priority \ntargeting of sub\u2013sectors and areas among donors is missing. The Government has requested \nsupport from ADB to jointly prepare a new ESS for 2006\u20132010 to serve as a framework for more \nsubstantial  donor  coordination.  The  new  ESS  will  address  all  sub\u2013sectors  and  promote \neducation  reforms  to  improve  the  quality  of  and  access  to  rural  education  services. \nComplementing the formal education system, strategies will be developed to provide lifelong \nlearning and training opportunities for youth and adults. The new ESS will also encourage \npublic-private partnership in education. \n \n7.  To improve access to education, the Government, supported by donors, is implementing \na school restructuring and rehabilitation program. However, due to limited resources, most rural \nschools have not yet benefited from rehabilitation measures. Large-scale internal migration to \nurban centers has increased the pressure on urban schools to maintain adequate education \nquality standards. The new Government has decided to extend the current 10-year education \nsystem to an 11-year system and is considering introducing a 12-year system soon. This \nextension of the schooling period by 1\u20132 years needs to be reflected in future rehabilitation \nplans and will require additional capacities and new learning and teaching materials. To resolve \nissues posed by inadequate educational facilities and to upgrade capacities to extend the \nschooling period, the Government has requested ADB to provide further assistance to identify \nand prioritize investment needs to be financed under the proposed loan project. \n \n8.  The lack of a systematic in-service training mechanism for teachers has been identified \nas  a  constraint  on  the  reform  process.  The  SEDP  supports  MOECS\u2019s  efforts  to  improve \ndidactics,  promote  a  pupil-centered  learning  environment,  and  introduce  information  and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1996.

However,  no  systematic \nteacher training mechanism to address challenges anticipated with the proposed introduction of \nan 11- or 12\u2013year system is yet in place. Taking into account that many rural schools provide \nonly 6 or 8 grades, the Government is anticipating difficulties implementing the 11-12 grade \nsystem countrywide. The TA will identify investment needs to strengthen pre-service and in-\nservice teacher training to meet the new challenges. \n \n9.  With support from the ESDP, the Government has privatized several state universities \nand developed an accreditation system for quality control of private universities. However, the \nstate expenditure on higher education is still a heavy burden, and there are too many public \nuniversities for the small population. The Government continues to support the subsector in \nvarious forms, including subsidies, scholarships for civil servants\u2019 families, and tax exemptions. \nThe TA will help the Government plan the reform of higher education by developing strategies to \nbe incorporated in the new ESS 2006\u20132010. \n \n10.  The Government enacted a decree to encourage the private sector to become involved \nin TEVT. Subsequently, the Government reduced its role in this subsector and reduced public \nsupport to secondary vocational schools. However, few private companies will or can support \nTEVT. As a result, TEVT has been one of most neglected areas of education. No systematic \nmechanism matches training provision with labor market demand. Most vocational schools use \noutdated equipment and curricula that were developed during the Soviet period. The demand \nfor skilled labor is growing, particularly in urban areas, but no mechanism offers skills training for \nyouths and adults responding to the demand. The TEVT system must be reviewed and the \nfuture role of the Government in the subsector defined. The TA will help the Government \nconsolidate  the  existing  TEVT  system  and  recommend  strategies  to  establish  a  flexible \ndemand\u2013driven system, to create lifelong training opportunities for youth and adults, enhance \nparticipation by industry, propose alternative financing mechanisms to promote skills training, \nand identify priority investment needs to support the proposed changes.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  In line with the ESS and the Millennium Development Goals, the overall goal of the TA is \nto improve access to and quality of education services for children and increase skills training \nopportunities for youth and adults. In line with the country strategy and program, the TA will \nexplore the possibility of taking a sector-wide approach to coordinate government and externally \nsupported activities in the education sector. Building on the achievements of the ESDP and \nongoing SEDP, the proposed project will particularly address priority needs in basic education \nand review the scope for consolidating the TEVT system. The expected TA outputs are (i) a \ndraft  ESS  for  2006\u20132010,  including  a  donor  coordination  mechanism  and  a  prioritized \ninvestment plan; (ii) draft strategies to align organizational structures, operational procedures, \nhuman resources (HR) management systems, and financial and HR requirements with the new \nESS developed for MOECS, relevant aimag (provincial) authorities, schools, teachers\u2019 training \ncolleges, and universities; (iii) a prioritized rehabilitation plan for further rehabilitation of school \nfacilities; and (iv) draft strategies and investment needs to introduce a flexible, market-oriented \nTEVT  system  to  create  lifelong  learning  opportunities;  and  (v)  a  loan  project  proposal, \nincorporating priority needs identified in (i) \u2013 (iv).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be conducted in a collaborative and participatory process ensuring a high \nlevel of congruence of goals between all major government and nongovernment stakeholders, \n ", "4  \nand the development partners. At the end of the implementation period, a participatory planning \nworkshop with all major stakeholders will discuss findings and recommendations and agree on \nthe design of the proposed new loan project. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n13.  Output 1. Building on the achievements of the ESS 2000\u20132005 a draft ESS for 2006\u2013 \n2010 addressing all subsectors will be developed. The new ESS will include strategies to \npromote the education reform process, establish a lifelong learning system for youth and adults, \nand set up an effective and efficient donor coordination mechanism and will also provide an \ninventory of the future investments. The new ESS will be formulated in close collaboration with \nall major government and nongovernment stakeholders and donors. Major activities under this \noutput include (i) reviewing the progress and achievements of the current ESS and identifying \nissues, and (ii) preparing a draft ESS 2006\u20132010 addressing all subsectors. \n \n14.  Output 2. To align organizational structures, operational procedures, HR management \nsystems, and financial and HR requirements with the new ESS 2006\u20132010, current institutional \ncapacities will be assessed and institutional arrangements between MOECS relevant aimag and \nsoum  (district)  authorities,  schools  and  public  training  institutions  reviewed.  Based  on  the \nreview, capacity-building strategies, including HR development plans, will be prepared. The \nreview will assess education financing, teachers\u2019 salary structure, and financial management of \nschools, and address the need to strengthen sector performance monitoring. \n \n15.  Output 3. A prioritized plan including detailed cost estimates for further rehabilitation of \nkindergarten, school, and college facilities will be prepared to complement the rehabilitation \nprogram implemented under the SEDP. The plan will include strategies for ensuring community \nparticipation in rehabilitation and operation and maintenance (O&M) of schools. Major activities \nwill be to (i) update the school mapping study; (ii) analyze the financial resources required for \nO&M of rehabilitated facilities; (iii) propose strategies to involve communities, students, and \nteachers in rehabilitating and maintaining facilities; and (iv) propose appropriate technologies \nand materials for heating systems. \n \n16.   Output 4. This component will clarify Government\u2019s future role in providing TEVT. \nStrategies will be developed to consolidate the current TEVT system and promote a flexible, \ndemand-driven,  cost-effective  system  offering  lifelong  training  opportunities  for  youths  and \nadults. Recommendations will be made to (i) enhance private sector involvement, (ii) consider \nalternative financial mechanisms to make more skills training programs available, and (iii) build \ncapacities for analyzing labor market trends and skills in demand. \n \n17.       Output 5. A loan project proposal will be prepared, focusing on priority areas agreed on \nwith the Government: school rehabilitation, teaching and learning materials, new needs arising \nfrom extending the schooling period by 1\u20132 years, and a flexible, demand-driven TEVT system. \nThe proposal will incorporate the outcomes of outputs 1\u20134 and include sector, economic and \ninstitutional analysis, and detailed costing and implementation arrangements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA cost is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 is the foreign \nexchange cost and $225,000 equivalent the local currency cost. The Government requests ADB \nto finance $500,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $100,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining local currency \ncost of $125,000 equivalent in kind. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government has been advised that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOECS will be the TA\u2019s Executing Agency and will provide suitable furnished office \nspace and counterpart support, including a qualified TA coordinator acceptable to ADB to \noversee TA implementation. Under the TA coordinator a consultant team will be established, \nconsisting of (i) seven international consultants: (a) education policy specialist and policy team \nleader (4.5 person-months), (b) education economist and organizational development specialist \n(3.0  person-months),  (c)  education  facilities  specialist  (2.0  person-months),  (d)  education \ninformation  management  specialist  (1.5  person-month),  (e)  TVET  specialist  (3.0  person-\nmonths),  (f)  training  specialist  (2.5  person-months),  and  (g)  participatory  project  planning \nspecialist (0.5 person month); and (ii) three domestic consultants: (a) education policy analyst \n(4.0 person-months), (b) financial analyst (4.0 person-months), and (c) maintenance specialist \n(2.0  person-months).  The  team  leader  will  submit  an  inception  report  4  weeks  after  the \nassignment starts, a draft final report 2 weeks before, and a final report 2 weeks after the \nparticipatory planning workshop.   \n \n20.  A steering committee, chaired by the vice minister of MOECS, will be established to \nprovide policy guidance and to help MOECS coordinate with all stakeholders. A joint advisory \nbody comprising government and nongovernment stakeholders and donor representatives will \nbe  established  to  provide  technical  advice  in  the  process  of  drafting  the  new  ESS  and \ndeveloping  a  donor  coordination  mechanism.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  5  months \ncommencing  in  February  2005.  At  the  end  of  the  implementation  period,  a  participatory \nworkshop involving major government and nongovernment stakeholders and donors will be \nconducted to present the findings of the TA and to agree on the concept for the TEDP. The \nconsultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. An international consulting firm will be selected based on the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method, using the simplified technical proposal. Outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 3. TA-financed equipment and materials will be procured either \nby consultants or ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.
