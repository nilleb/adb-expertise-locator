This information is being disclosed to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. ", " \nI.  THE ONGOING PROGRAM \n  \n1.  The Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program (TSCFP) works with partner financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) to close financing gaps of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The \nSupply Chain Finance Program (SCFP) arm of TSCFP operates in 10 of ADB\u2019s developing \nmember countries (DMCs) and has seen rapid growth recently. In 2020, SCFP supported 1,447 \ntransactions, an increase of 151% from the previous year, with the overall transaction value \nincreasing 108% to $246 million.   \n \n2.  Being complementary programs, SCFP and ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program (TFP) were \noperationally merged in 2020 into the Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program (TSCFP). \nWhereas TFP takes bank risk to support cross border trade, SCFP shares corporate risk with \npartner financial institutions to support both domestic and cross-border supply chains. While TFP \nhas scaled into one of ADB\u2019s largest businesses\u2013in 2020, TFP supported over 7,000 transactions \nvalued at $5.8 billion\u2013the SCFP is small but growing rapidly. Merging these two businesses is \nhelping SCFP scale up by leveraging off TFP\u2019s existing relationships and experience, while \nachieving operational efficiency and delivering even better client service.  \n \n3.  TSCFP  is  central  to  ADB\u2019s  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.1 Of  the  13,000 \ntransactions supported under TFP over 2020 and 2021, several supported COVID vaccine \nimports, test kits, and medical equipment.2  The transactions supported companies that provided \nessential  services  and  financial  intermediaries  that  granted  direct  financing  to  individual \ncompanies, including SMEs, or facilitated local, regional, and global trade and related supply \nchains  materially  affected  by  the  pandemic\u2019s  economic  fallout.  Of  the  1,447  transactions \nsupported under SCFP, 1,288 were COVID-related transactions worth $211 million. Of this, 1,058 \ntransactions  valued  at  $185  million  provided  support  to  the  pharmaceutical  sector,  with  a \nparticular focus on SMEs. \n \n4.  TSCFP helps deliver Sustainable Development Goals through its various knowledge \nproducts, services and solutions, including ones targeted at promoting sustainability in trade, \nensuring integrity and transparency in supply chains, as well as helping accelerate progress in \ngender equality.3 In addition, TSCFP produced knowledge products such as the COVID-19 supply \nchain mapping tool.4  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The Trade Finance Gaps, Growth and Job Survey published in October 2021 showed a \nglobal trade finance gap of $1.7 trillion, with more than 40% of rejected trade finance transactions \n \n \n1  ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2  In December 2020, a $500 million Vaccine Import Facility under the existing TFP program limit was developed to \nhelp developing economies in Asia and the Pacific purchase vaccines and related equipment needed to fight COVID-\n19. The facility provides guarantees through the program\u2019s network of partner banks to support the purchase of \nvaccines, as well as glass vials, syringes, and equipment for cold chain storage facilities. Through risk sharing with \npartner banks, the $500 million facility can be leveraged to $1 billion.  \n3  United Nations Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform. The SDGs. \n4  A new tool was launched by TSCFP in May 2020 and published on the ADB website that maps, end-to-end, the \nentire supply chain for 34 critical pandemic-fighting goods, such as ventilators, N95 masks, as well as vaccine supply \nchains. The tool helps banks, investors and government ensure companies have no bottlenecks and financial support \nis there to ramp up supply.  \n \nPUBLIC. This information is being disclosed to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. ", "2 \ncoming from SMEs.5 The gap has grown over the course of the pandemic and is likely getting \nlarger as inflation raises the value of transactions, thereby lowering the ability of existing country \nand counterparty financing limits exist to meet demand. The gap is exacerbated by a lack of \ncapacity on the part of both SMEs and the local banks that is needed to provide supply chain \nfinance. Regulatory gaps are also constraining SME growth and support.  \n \n6.  Recognizing TSCFP\u2019s growing expertise in implementing supply chain finance in banks \nacross ADB\u2019s developing member countries, the United States Department of State has invited \nthe TSCFP to submit a proposal to aid SMEs in the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral \nTechnical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Region to overcome factors constraining their \naccess to trade. The State Department aims to catalyze economic growth in the BIMSTEC Region \nand views TSCFP\u2019s experience in supply chain finance capacity development as a good vehicle \nthrough which to implement its objectives. \n \n7.  Closing SME finance gaps, which have widened during the global pandemic, delivers \nsignificant development impact by furthering growth and job creation and therefore reducing \npoverty. The TSCFP is well placed to close these gaps by: (i) expanding SCFP, which delivers \nfinance to SMEs, with the aim of onboarding DMC banks as partner financial institutions (PFIs) \nafter 3-4 quarters of intensive capacity building in supply chain finance; (ii) working with PFIs to \ndevelop their capacity to support more SMEs, including through supply chain finance, and in \ntraining on issues related to SME financing, such as anti-money-laundering and sustainability; (iii) \nproviding capacity building to SMEs themselves on understanding the benefits of supply chain \nfinance and how it works, as well as how to attract financing; and (iv) working as One ADB to \nclose legislative gaps, including for the provision of supply chain finance, which impede greater \nsupport for SMEs. \n \n8.  The proposed $2,222,200 technical assistance (TA)6 would support SME capacity building \nin Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The anticipated outcome of the TA will be expanded \nuptake of supply chain finance in ADB DMCs in said BIMSTEC countries. Planned activities under \nthe proposed TA are categorized as follows: \n \n(i)  intense  capacity  building  including  the  provision  of  supply  chain  finance \ninformation technology software, as necessary, for five DMC banks to enable them \nto provide supply chain finance to SMEs and apply gender lens financing; \n(ii)  training for a wider array of DMC banks and corporate clients who have SME \nsuppliers. The TA will provide supply chain finance, gender, anti-money-laundering, \nand sustainability-related online training, webinars, and face-to-face training post-\npandemic; and  \n(iii)  regulatory  work  to  review  and  identify  gaps  in  local  supply  chain  finance \nregulations.  \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  and  promotes  Operational  Priority  1: \nAddressing Remaining Poverty and Reducing Inequalities Pillar 2 Quality Jobs Generated.7 \nThrough TSCFP\u2019s gender equity and safeguards initiatives, the TA supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nOperational Priorities 2 and 3.
