INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to promote environmentally \nsustainable infrastructure investment. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan, 2015\u20132017 for the PRC.1 In May 2015, ADB and the Ministry of Environmental Protection \n(MEP) reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, \nand terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Physical infrastructure is remarkably poor in most developing countries in Asia and the \nPacific. It must be greatly improved if the full benefits of regional cooperation and the cross-\nborder sharing of ideas are to be realized. ADB estimates that Asia and the Pacific will need  \n$8  trillion  in  national  infrastructure  investment  and  $290  billion  in  regional  infrastructure \ninvestment during 2010\u20132020.3 The foreign investment and contractor resources required to \ncomplete the needed infrastructure projects are substantial. The PRC, already providing much \nof the foreign investment and contractors in the region, has an important role in filling the \ninfrastructure gap. \n \n3.  The PRC has been a favored destination for foreign investment since the opening of its \neconomy began in the late 1970s. By 2014, the PRC had become a net capital exporter. With a \nhigh savings rate and active government support for outbound investment, the country has \nenormous potential to increase international investment. The PRC\u2019s outbound investment has \nrisen rapidly since 2000. In 2002, the PRC\u2019s total outbound investment on acquisitions and \ngreenfield projects was less than $3 billion. Investment rose to almost $108 billion by 2013.4 By \nthe first half of 2014, the PRC\u2019s outbound investment and international construction contracts \nhad reached $870 billion.5 Each of these investments and contracts is valued at more than  \n$100 million; the contracts cover a range of industries, including energy, mining, real estate, and \ntransport. \n \n4.  Much of the PRC\u2019s outbound capital is invested in basic infrastructure.  The PRC\u2019s \ninfrastructure boom of recent decades has created many enterprises with the capacity to design, \nbuild, and operate large infrastructure projects. PRC companies now have the expertise and \nexperience needed to construct high-quality, major infrastructure projects internationally. \n \n5.  In  2013,  the  PRC  announced  the  Silk  Road  Economic  Belt  and  the  21st  Century \nMaritime  Silk  Road  (MSR)  (One  Belt  One  Road)  initiative.  This  focuses  on  achieving \nconnectivity and cooperation between countries in Eurasia through two main components, the \nland-based  Silk  Road  Economic  Belt  (SREB)  and  the  ocean-going  MSR.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment in countries along the SREB and MSR is an important part of the One Belt One \nRoad initiative. PRC investment is now expected to increase for infrastructure projects in the \nSREB and MSR regions,6 which cover a large part of Asia and the Pacific. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

In line with the expected increase in the PRC\u2019s outbound investment, the government \nhas sought to incentivize the compliance of PRC investors and contractors with host country \nenvironmental protection laws and regulations. The PRC\u2019s 12th Five Year Plan (2011\u20132015) \nhighlights investors\u2019 social responsibilities, including environment safeguards.7 In 2013, MEP \nand the Ministry of Commerce released guidelines for environment protection for overseas \ninvestment  and  cooperation,  which  provide  guidance  to  PRC  investors  and  contractors  to \n\u201cfurther standardize environment protection behavior in the activities of overseas investment, \nand to identify and prevent environmental risks in time, and guide companies to actively fulfill \nthe social responsibility of environment protection, and establish a favorable overseas image of \nPRC enterprises to support host nations\u2019 sustainable development.\u201d8 \n \n7.  Industry  associations  also  issued  supporting  guidelines.  The  China  Chamber  of \nCommerce of Metals, Minerals, and Chemicals Importers and Exporters prepared guidelines for \nsocial responsibility in outbound mining investments. The guidelines recommend that mining \nfirms integrate environmental protection into their daily operation management system and \nfollow international practice and host country environmental protection regulations, and include \npre-operation environmental impact evaluation, periodic environmental impact monitoring, and \ncontingency plan design. These guidelines are not mandatory as environmental protection is \nunder the host country\u2019s jurisdiction.  \n \n8.  The PRC\u2019s international projects routinely follow international practice and comply with \nthe  host  country\u2019s  environmental  protection  policies  and  regulations.  But  in  some  cases, \nprojects do not meet the host country\u2019s regulations and have negative impacts on the local \nenvironment. Key reasons for this are poor governance systems in host countries, a lack of solid \nenvironmental  management  during  project  implementation,  and  weak  policy  coordination \nbetween the PRC and the host country.9 Weak governance systems in host countries fail to \nprotect  communities  and  the  environment  from  potential  harm.  Some  PRC  companies, \nespecially  some  small  and  medium-sized  companies,  which  do  not  heed  social  and \nenvironmental responsibility within the PRC, are now taking these negative practices out of the \ncountry. \n \n9.  A lack of coherence between international investment, trade treaties, and environmental \nagreements adds to the problems. From an international legal perspective, this is a grey area. \nBetter policy coordination is necessary among governments to enhance  the environmental \nsustainability of international projects. The PRC government requested ADB assistance to help \naddress institutional and capacity constraints; introduce international practice on environmental \nadministration, management, and protection; and work with host countries to facilitate PRC high \nquality  infrastructure  investments.  This  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  sustainable \ndevelopment within partner countries. \n \n                                                \n7  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission. 2011. 12th Five-\nYear Plan, 2011-2015.

This  TA  will  review  international  environment  safeguard  practices,  and  offer  policy \nadvice to MEP.10 Capacity development assistance will be provided to PRC investors and \ncontractors on environmental management. Regional policy dialogue will be conducted through \nconferences and other events. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be increased environmentally sustainable infrastructure projects in Asia \nand  the  Pacific.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  environment  safeguards  for  the  PRC\u2019s \ninternational infrastructure investments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will produce three outputs: (i) environmental administration and management of \nthe  PRC\u2019s  international  infrastructure  investments  assessed;  (ii)  international  practices  and \nenvironmental administration experiences identified, analyzed, and shared; and (iii) the PRC\u2019s \ncapacity for environmental management of international infrastructure investments developed. \n \n13.  Output  1:  Environmental  administration  and  management  of  the  PRC\u2019s \ninternational infrastructure investments assessed. The PRC\u2019s environmental administration \nprocedures  and  policies  for  foreign  investments  will  be  reviewed.  The  environmental \nperformance  and  management  of  outbound  investors  and  contractors  will  be  assessed. \nInternational practices for environmental safeguards for international infrastructure investments \nwill be reviewed according to the source of funding (e.g., foreign direct investment, multilateral \ndevelopment assistance, and bilateral development assistance). Based on international practice \nand the PRC experience, the consultants will design a policy package for MEP to ensure that \nenvironmental safeguards carry more weight during the government\u2019s decision-making process. \nThis will help incentivize outbound PRC infrastructure investors to improve their environmental \nperformance. \n \n14.  Output 2: International practices and environmental administration experiences \nidentified, analyzed, and shared. Both capital exporters and investment host country agencies \nshould work to ensure infrastructure projects follow local regulations and relevant international \nstandards. At least two high-level policy dialogue conferences will be designed to introduce \ninternational  practices  and  share  environmental  administration  experience  among  ADB \ndeveloping member countries. MEP has set up a working relationship with the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  and  participating  countries  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC).11 The targeted participants will be the environmental protection agencies \nof these countries. \n                                                \n10 International institutions recommend good practices for environmental management. Of these practices, the most \nimportant are the environmental management and environmental performance evaluation guidelines: International \nStandards  Organization.  ISO  14031:2013.  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=52297); \nOrganisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.

Administered by ADB and overseen by the environment \nministries of the six countries that form the Working Group on Environment, the Core Environment Program aims to \nachieve \u201can environmentally friendly and climate-resilient GMS Program.\u201d It is coordinated by the Environment \n ", "4   \n \n15.  Output  3:  The  PRC\u2019s  capacity  for  environmental  management  of  international \ninfrastructure  investments  developed.  An  international  infrastructure  environmental \nmanagement manual will be designed. Targeting PRC international investors and contractors, \nthe  manual  will  cover  the  following  topics:  (i)  principles  of  environmental  performance \nevaluation,  (ii)  environmental  contingency  design,  (iii)  environmental  review  and  life-cycle \nassessment, (iv) environment public policy, (v) major investment host countries\u2019 environmental \nprotection administration structure and policy, (vi) environmental training for employees, and \n(vii) case studies. Once the international environmental management manual is finalized, two \ntraining workshops will be delivered to the PRC\u2019s international infrastructure investors and \ncontractors. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space and local transport, remuneration and \nper diem of local support staff, equipment, and other in-kind contributions (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MEP is the executing agency. The Foreign Economic Cooperation Office of MEP will be \nthe implementing agency, supervising the day-to-day work of the consultants. It will assume \noverall responsibility for workshops and conferences. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017. It will engage a \nconsulting firm comprising two international consultants (3 person-months) and three national \nconsultants (12 person-months). Assisted by the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office, the \nconsulting firm will provide international experience and organize conferences with participants \nfrom  GMS  and  CAREC  member  country  environmental  protection  agencies.  The  national \nconsultants will have expertise in PRC environmental protection and international investment \nadministration policies. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod following the simplified technical proposal procedure. The weighted ratio of technical \nand financial proposals will be 80:20. The consulting firm will submit all reports in English and \nChinese to MEP and ADB in hard and electronic copies. The consultants will maintain close \nworking relations with ADB and MEP, and will regularly discuss progress and findings. Tripartite \nmeetings involving ADB, MEP, and the consultants will be held when necessary to provide \nguidance to the consultants and to review draft reports. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nOperations Center, which is hosted by ADB\u2019s Thailand Resident Mission. Under CAREC, environment is listed as \none of the second tier cooperation areas. The PRC has been actively participating in environment-related \ncooperation under both the CAREC and GMS.  \n ", "  5 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Promotion  of  Environmentally \nSustainable Infrastructure Investment in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nIm  pact the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned with: \nEnvironmentally sustainable infrastructure projects in Asia and the Pacific increased (PRC\u2019s 12th Five Year \nPlan, 2011\u20132015)a \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nEnvironment  a.
