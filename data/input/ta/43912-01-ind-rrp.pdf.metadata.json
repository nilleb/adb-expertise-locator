With increased urbanization, this can be a \nbarrier  to  equitable  and  widespread  economic  growth  and  is \nleading  to  increased  private  vehicle  use.  This  stimulates  traffic \ndelays,  environmental  degradation,  inefficient  fuel  consumption, \nand economic losses through time wastage. \n \nThe  project  directly  addresses  these  challenges  to  Bangalore\u2019s \ngrowth and environment by creating a modern mass transit system \nthat  supports  economic  growth,  employment  generation,  and \nequitable connectivity. It also mitigates environmental pollution by \nproviding  an  alternative  to  private  vehicles.  The  project  will \nestablish an ultimately sustainable urban transport company with \nsound  institutional  and  governance  structures,  based  on  an \ninnovative urban transport financing model. This is a first for India \nand could become a model for infrastructure development in other \nstates and cities.  \n \nThe  focus  is  on  creating  a  commercially  viable  and  bankable \nproject that can successfully attract commercial debt, and which \nholds the potential for future wider private sector participation. The \nproject  structure,  which  uses  sovereign  loans  and  support  to \nleverage commercial lending, creates a self-sustaining model for \nfinancing  urban  transport  projects.  These  projects  are  typically \namongst the most difficult infrastructure projects to finance, and \nare the ones which least lend themselves to up front private sector ", "ii \nparticipation.  The  public  sector  approach,  with  private  sector \nstructures and discipline and possible future private sector direct \nparticipation, is viewed as the best model for this sector at this \nstage of development in India. It is also one which should help \ncatalyze  commercial  debt  and  private  sector  participation  on  a \nmuch wider basis across the country in future. \n \nImplementation of the project will result in a modal shift toward \npublic  transportation  and  lower  levels  of  congestion  with  a \nsubstantial reduction in the number of buses and use of private \nvehicles. This will lead to fuel savings, improvements in air quality \nand public health, time savings, and less accidents and fatalities.  \n   \nProject Sponsors  The Government of India and the Government of Karnataka. \n   \nProposed ADB  ADB  will  provide  a  direct  secured  loan  (without  sovereign \nAssistance  guarantee) to BMRC of up to $250,000,000.  \n   \nImplementation  BMRC has been constituted as a special-purpose vehicle with both \nArrangements  sponsors having an equal shareholding. Given the importance of \nthe project and the impossibility of financing it on a stand-alone \nbasis,  the  sponsors  have  committed  significant  support  to  the \nproject in the form of equity and subordinated debt. The sponsors \nhave  drawn  together  experts  from  various  agencies  and  have \nengaged an external technical consultant to carry out the design of \nthe metro rail transit system and assist BMRC with procurement, \nconstruction,  and  commissioning  of  the  project,  as  well  as  the \ntraining of operation and management personnel. Procurement of \ngoods  and  services  is  being  undertaken  by  BMRC  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Around  80%  of  construction \ncontracts  have  been  awarded  and  about  33%  of  physical \nconstruction has been completed as of end December 2010. \n   \nJustification / ADB  ADB support provides crucial credibility to the project which has \nValue-Added  several  pioneering  features,  including  lending  and  institutional \nstructures. Successful implementation will set the precedent for \nsimilar financing models for urban transport as well as provide \ncost-effective  connectivity  solutions  for  middle-sized  and  large \nIndian cities, which are suffering from public transport gaps and \nexponential private vehicle growth leading to increased pollution, \naccidents, and travel delays.  \n \nThe  project\u2019s  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  will  help \npromote  strong  governance,  financial  sustainability,  robust \ninstitutional  accountability,  and  overall  efficiency  in  operations. \nADB\u2019s participation, capital structuring, and due diligence will help \nmobilize long-term debt funding and catalyze domestic financial \ninstitutions to consider long-term loans for the project and other \nsimilar projects. \n   \n ", "       \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRC) for the Bangalore Metro Rail Transit System \nProject.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n \n1.  Project Development \n \n2.  Given  the  need  for  effective  public  transport  solutions  to  meet  the  increasing \nurbanization-driven challenges in the city, the Government of India and the state government \n(sponsor(s)) examined a number of possible urban transport solutions for the city, including \ndifferent modalities. The rail-based mass transit system was viewed by the sponsors as most \nappropriate for the city.  \n \n2.  Government Financing Approach and Asian Development Bank Involvement \n  \n3.  Unlike  the  Delhi  metro  that  is  fully  funded  by  government  equity  and  sovereign-\nguaranteed debt, the national and state governments decided to create a new financing model \nfor the project which would only partly rely on government funds (through a mix of government \nequity, government subordinated debt, and onlending from the national government of the Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  loan,  and \nleverage these so as to also raise commercial debt from banks and/or private financing sources. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB), through a number of technical assistance programs,1 has \nTPF FPT\nbeen assisting the national government since 2007 in developing bankable infrastructure project \nmodels  able  to  access  new  financing  sources  without  recourse  to  sovereign  government \nguarantees,  whether  through  commercial  nonrecourse  debt  or  public\u2013private  partnerships \n(PPPs). The possible use of ADB\u2019s new lending modalities, i.e., nonsovereign public sector \nloans, was a factor in this structuring decision.  \n \n4.  Initial discussions were held with the national and state governments and BMRC in early \n2009 with a view to including the project under this proposed assistance modality. Due diligence \nand structuring assistance to BMRC to help develop a bankable and leveraged financing model \nfor the project was provided by the ADB team and consultant financial modeling specialists. \nDiscussions were also held with the national government\u2019s Ministry of Urban Development on \npossible  financing  models.  After  preliminary  national  government  approval  of  the  initial \nstructuring model for BMRC and the acceptance of nonsovereign public sector lending modalities \nfor the project, a final phase of technical, social, and environmental impact assessments was \nundertaken.  \n \nB.  Sector Background \n \n1.  Metro Rail Systems \n \n5.  Urban transport is a critical component of urban services. Apart from allowing direct and \nefficient travel, it also creates a better urban environment by reducing congestion and pollution. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Pilot Projects Initiative: Mainstreaming PPPs in India. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Developing Urban \nTP PT\nBankable Projects. Manila.  \n ", "2    \n \nEconomic benefits of rail systems are significant and include savings in travel time, reduced \noperating costs, safer transportation with lower levels of accidents and related fatalities, and \nlower levels of local pollution. The higher level of connectivity and efficiency makes the rail \nsystem  more  attractive  to  businesses  and  tourists,  thereby  attracting  investments  and \ncontributing to economic growth. Rail-based urban transit systems have an advantage over road-\nbased systems in terms of efficiency and carrying capacity, especially when catering to heavy \npassenger traffic in densely populated areas. In developed countries, most large cities have rail-\nbased mass transit railways as the core of their transport systems. However, in developing \ncountries there has not been enough emphasis on mass transit or integrated city planning, with \nthe result that many metropolitan cities depend predominantly on private transport modes. With \nincreasing road congestion and pollution, cities are being forced to examine and develop better \nmeans of transportation. Therefore, rail-based metro systems, with their substantial carrying \ncapacity, are a mode of choice for large cities with high passenger traffic densities. \n \n6.  In India, Mumbai and Chennai had the legacy of a suburban rail system, but the city of \nKolkata developed India\u2019s first new metro rail system implemented by Indian Railways. The Delhi \nMetro Rail Corporation (DMRC) developed its large metro system for Delhi as a stand-alone \nproject. Subsequent to this, Bangalore proposed a metro system through a joint-venture initiative \nbetween  the  national  and  state  governments.  Chennai  is  following  a  similar  model  in \ncollaboration  with  the  national  government.  Mumbai  and  Hyderabad  have  awarded  metro \nsystems through a PPP approach as build\u2013operate\u2013transfer projects. Jaipur, Kochi, and other \ncities are examining development of metro rail systems. \n \n7.  The development of urban rail systems, previously under the ambit of the Indian Railways \nAct  1989,  has  seen  city  administrations  taking  increasing  responsibility  for  urban  transport \ndevelopment under the Indian Tramways Act of 1909 and other subsequent acts. The Delhi \nMetro Railway (Operation and Maintenance) Act 2002 was specifically enacted to address the \nneeds of a metro system in Delhi, and a subsequent amendment to this act in 2009 extended its \nreach  to  other  metropolitan  cities  such  as  Bangalore,  Mumbai,  and  Chennai.  The \nimplementation, operation, maintenance, and safety aspects of metro systems are covered under \nthis act.2  \nPF FP\n \n2.  Performance Gaps \n \n8.  The lack of a public transport system that efficiently and economically services all parts of \nthe city seriously impacts the poor. While those using personal vehicles (such as cars and two-\nwheelers) are also affected, the proportionate impact on urban poor people is possibly far higher \ndue to their not having access to personal vehicles. While public buses are generally available, \ntravel by buses through congested urban areas takes more time and is also not comfortable over \nlonger distances, given the fact that most of the buses are not air-conditioned. \n \n9.  Road vehicles are a significant source of air pollution and their proliferation leads to a \ndegraded urban environment and attendant diseases. A white paper on pollution in Delhi, prior to \nthe changeover to compressed natural gas for buses, showed that pollution by road vehicles \naccounted for more than 60% of total air pollution.3 The proliferation of personal modes of \nTPF FPT\ntransport (such as cars and two-wheelers) is therefore an immediate concern, since most cities in \nIndia have a modal share of public transport of only about 50%.  \n                                                 \n2  The act deals with the implementation, operation, tariff fixing, and safety regulations for metro systems.  \nTP3PT Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests.

While a metro system cannot by itself address all of these severe problems, it will provide \na high-capacity transport corridor along specific arteries of the city, which will draw a large \nproportion of users from the roads. A well-planned intermodal transit system combining buses \nand rail-based systems will also need to be built across the city; generally the rail-based systems \ncater to the higher traffic density corridors, while the buses act in the proximate areas as feeders \nto the rail system. Without such a system, the effectiveness of the metro would be much lower. In \nthe case of Bangalore, at the planning stage, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation \nwas closely involved with the BMRC for planning the bus schedules and routes, taking the metro \nas the high-density traffic corridor. Key stations such as Majestic and Byappanahalli are being \ndeveloped  as  intermodal  centers  where  the  public  transport  for  rail  and  road  are  closely \nintegrated. \n \n11.  One reason why many cities in developing countries have not built metro systems has \nbeen the high initial cost. Since most funding has to come from governments and resources are \nconstrained, the focus has traditionally been on small-scale urban transport improvements such \nas  widening  roads,  constructing  grade  separators,  or  adding  buses  to  the  fleet.  Such \nimprovements have not been able to address or catch up with the escalating scale of the \nproblems. While most large cities and governments have realized the importance of having a \nmetro system as a key element of any urban transport system, the funding constraints remain. \nThere is, therefore, a clear opportunity and growing desire for commercial finance to step in and \nbridge some of the gap. \n \n3.  Financing Constraints for Metro Rail Systems \n \n12.  The few metro systems developed in India have been funded by the government, either \ndirectly  or  through  sovereign-guaranteed  loans.  However,  investment  requirements  are \naccelerating beyond government financing capacity and the Ministry of Urban Development has \nestimated  a  Rs2,070  billion  ($45  billion  equivalent)  need  for  urban  transport  infrastructure \ninvestment in cities with populations of 100,000 or more in the period 2008\u22122028. With these \nrising needs, governments are no longer in a position to finance all such projects. The need \ntherefore for other solutions such as commercial debt, private funds, and PPPs is critical to build \nand operate metro systems. However, given the very substantial up front capital investment \nrequirements for metro projects and the social and economic limitations on fares and passenger \ntrips, especially in the initial years of operations, short-term financial viability of metro systems \nworldwide is rarely achievable. Leveraging of government grants, revenue support schemes, \nland development rights on additional land given to the project, and/or other revenues from \ncommercial development of land in the station areas are seen as essential to ensure viability and \nbankability. \n \n13.  While a number of cities have developed plans for metro projects, the significant funding \nconstraints have yet to be addressed. The gradual shift from government direct funding to \nsovereign-guaranteed loans and then commercial finance is illustrated by the cases of Kolkata, \nDelhi, and other cities such as Bangalore and Mumbai. The Kolkata metro was taken up by the \nMinistry of Railways as a national government project, while in Delhi, the national and state \ngovernments set up a joint venture and the national government provided sovereign-guaranteed \ndebt. The most recent projects are seeking commercial finance through debt (Bangalore) or debt \nand equity (Mumbai and Hyderabad), with viability support coming from the national and state \ngovernments. In the case of Bangalore, the national government has agreed to participate in a \njoint venture with the state government (owned equally), and also to support the project by way \nof equity, subordinated debt, and the onlending of the JICA ODA loan.  \n ", "4    \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n \n14.  As stated in Strategy 2020,4 ADB investment in infrastructure is fundamental to achieving \nTPF FPT\npoverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  and  also  contributes  to  environmentally  sustainable \ngrowth and regional integration. ADB\u2019s infrastructure operations are not to be limited to building \nphysical assets, but will also include improving the delivery of infrastructure services through, for \nexample, building the capacity of developing member countries (DMCs) for better infrastructure \nmanagement,  and  promoting  institutional  and  policy  reforms  that  enhance  the  operational \nefficiency and sustainability of infrastructure projects. Under Strategy 2020, ADB\u2019s infrastructure \noperations will promote private sector engagement in financing infrastructure to augment the \nsupply of capital for infrastructure. Development of urban transport is one of the focus areas of \nurban infrastructure under Strategy 2020. The strategy also envisages ADB helping DMCs move \ntheir economies onto low-carbon growth paths by modernizing public transport systems. ADB \ncan assist DMCs and their municipalities address a range of environmental problems resulting \nfrom rapid urbanization. This includes supporting cleaner modes of transport. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Partnership Strategy \n \n15.  The  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  2009\u22122012  is  in  line  with  the  national \ngovernment's aims for infrastructure development, requiring over $500 billion over a 5-year \nperiod (2007\u20132012).5 The project strongly supports the CPS, which emphasizes infrastructure \nTPF FPT\ndevelopment (e.g., transport, energy, urban, agriculture, and water resources management); \ncatalyzes investment; and facilitates private sector participation in infrastructure development, \nincluding support for inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. The project enables \nbetter  leveraging  of  scarce  sovereign  resources,  and  spurs  private  sector  and  commercial \nfunding for infrastructure projects. \n \n16.  Crosscutting themes\u2014such as private sector development, gender and development, and \nenvironmental sustainability\u2014have been mainstreamed within the sector road maps in the CPS. \nGiven the challenges facing India and the world due to climate change and degradation of the \nenvironment, the environmental focus of the CPS includes a program to lower pollution and \ngreenhouse gas emissions by strengthening rail and urban transport infrastructure. The project \nis,  therefore,  consistent  with  meeting  the  objectives  of  infrastructure  development  in  an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner through nonsovereign participation. \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Description \n \n1.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n \n17.  The proposal for a metro system in Bangalore was cleared by the state government in \nMarch 2005 and the national government in April 2006. The national and state governments \nproposed that the project should be implemented through a special-purpose company. BMRC, \nan entity incorporated in India under the Companies Act 1956, will be the borrower for the \nproject. BMRC is a public sector entity wholly and jointly owned (50:50) by the national and state \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2008.

BMRC\u2019s board is chaired by the secretary of urban development of the national \ngovernment, and the managing director is a senior civil servant from the Indian Administrative \nService.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n18.  The  DMRC  has  been  actively  involved  in  assisting  BMRC  in  planning,  design,  and \nprocurement. The planning, design, and supervision of the works are the responsibility of a \ntechnical  consultant  engaged  by  BMRC  (general  consultant).  The  general  consultant  is  a \nconsortium  of  RITES  (India),  Oriental  Consulting  Company  (Japan),  Parsons  Brinckerhoff \nT\nInternational (United States), and SYSTRA (France), procured under the JICA guidelines through \nT\na transparent process.  \n \n19.  The metro rail transit system has been designed to meet a capacity of 40,000 peak-hour \npeak direction traffic. The operations plan envisages a 3.0-minute gap between trains with 31 \nT T\ntrains on the north\u2013south line, and a 3.3 minute gap with 25 trains on the east\u2013west line. End-to-\nend travel time is 33 minutes on the north\u2013south line and 44 minutes on the east\u2013west line. The \nscheduled speed is 32 km per hour, with a maximum of 80 km per hour. \n \n20.  Procurement in relation to all the construction contracts has been conducted through \nopen  tenders  on  a  transparent  basis.  BMRC\u2019s  procurement  processes  are  dictated  by  the \nKarnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act (1999). Karnataka is one of the few states in \nIndia  to  have  specific  legislation  for  transparent  procurement  processes  and  penalties  for \nviolation thereof. In addition, the JICA ODA loan also has procurement covenants and therefore \nall procurement, including that of the general consultants, has been carried out transparently \nthrough open tenders. BMRC\u2019s audit is carried out by the comptroller and auditor general of \nIndia, and is a rigorous third-party examination. \n \n3.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n \n21.  The project will develop the physical infrastructure for a metro rail system for Bangalore \nand will operate the system as per the design parameters. The major components of the project \nare as follows: \n \n(i)  An east\u2013west corridor of 18.1 km, including a 4.8 km underground portion. \n(ii)  A north\u2013south corridor of 24.2 km, including a 4.0 km underground portion and \ninterconnection between corridors at Majestic. \n(iii)  One at-grade station, 32 elevated stations, and 7 underground stations. \n(iv)  Electrical works consisting of 750 volts direct current third rail traction and power \nsupply. \n(v)  A signaling and telecommunications system consisting of continuous automatic \ntrain  control  with  cab  signaling,  a  centralized  train  control  system  comprising \nautomatic train protection, and automatic train supervision. \n(vi)  An automatic fare collection system with 6\u22129 ticketing gates per station. \n(vii)  Initially 168 rolling stock units (cars) for initial operations, comprising 56 trains of 3 \ncoaches each. Subsequently, in line with projected demand, this will be increased \nto 56 trains of 6 coaches each with a total of 336 cars.  \n(viii)  Depots at Byappanahalli and Peenya. \n \n22.  The  project  outcome  will  be  an  efficient,  well-used,  environmentally  friendly,  and \nfinancially stable urban transport system for Bangalore. Better connectivity and efficiency in the \n ", "6    \n \ntransport systems will make the city more attractive for business investments and contribute to \neconomic  growth.  The  project  will  increase  the  share  of  public  transport  in  total  intracity \npassenger movements and improve the environmental quality of the city. It is estimated that by \n2021 usage will be around 2 million passenger trips per day, and the underlying modal shift from \nprivate to public modes is expected to be 10%\u221215% for BMRC alone (not factoring in any new \nline developments). \n \nB.  Development Impact \n \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n \n23.  India's economic growth over 2001\u22122008 has spurred rapid urbanization, with 28% of the \ntotal  population  living  in  urban  agglomerations;  this  is  expected  to  reach  40%  of  the  total \npopulation, or around 590 million people, living in urban areas by 2030.6 Forty metropolitan \nPF FP\ncities7 with a population of more than 1 million account for 35% of the urban population. It is \nPF FP\nexpected that by 2030, 60 metropolitan cities will have populations exceeding 1 million. Urban \nIndia contributes 58% of gross domestic product, and this is expected to reach 70% by 2030 and \ngenerate 70% of new employment. The number of urban households is expected to increase \nfrom 22 million in 2010 to 91 million in 2030, with a fourfold increase in average national income. \nGrowth of the urban areas is therefore vital for India's economic growth and for an equitable \ndistribution of growth, but it brings enormous challenges, not least to effective transportation. \n \n24.  To contribute to growth, urban areas require adequate and suitable infrastructure, of \nwhich public transportation is an essential component. Public transportation networks (i) enable \naccess to more productive urban space usage and improved densification patterns; (ii) mitigate \nenvironmental pollution in areas where vehicular emissions are significant; (iii) save fuel; and (iv) \nprovide connectivity solutions for all, especially the poor and middle-income groups. Efficient \ntransport systems save travel time, making city workforces more productive, improving the image \nof a city, and making a city a more attractive place for investment and business. Evidence \nindicates a direct cost of congestion of around 2% of gross domestic product per year, which \nPP\npublic transportation systems can help alleviate. The project\u2019s direct development impact is that it \ncreates a mass transit system that supports economic growth, employment generation, and \nequitable connectivity. It also mitigates environmental pollution by providing an alternative to \nprivate vehicles. The project will demonstrate the functioning of a sustainable urban transport \ncompany  with  adequate  institutional  and  governance  structures  and  an  innovative  urban \ntransport financing model. It will provide a successful modality for public transport which can be \nreplicated in other cities. \n \n2.  Widening Access to Markets and Economic Opportunities \n \n25.  The focus of the project is to create a commercially viable and bankable project vehicle \nthat can successfully attract commercial debt. The project structure, leveraging sovereign equity \nand loans with commercial lending, creates a self-sustaining model for financing urban transport \nprojects. The successful implementation of the project should lead to its replication and catalyze \ncommercial debt and private sector participation in the sector in other places.  \n \n \n                                                 \n6  McKinsey Global Institute. 2010.

Implementation of the project will result in a modal shift toward public transportation, \nlower levels of congestion with a substantial reduction in the number of buses, and lower use of \nprivate vehicles, leading to fuel savings, improvements in air quality, time savings, and lower \nlevels of accidents. Many of these benefits are difficult to quantify, but BMRC has proposed the \ncreation of an environmental and social management division that will ensure not only project \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguards  but  also  the  development  of \nemissions monitoring for the city over the long term. \n \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Environment \n \n27.  The  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  significant  environmental  improvements  for \nBangalore  city.  A  decrease  in  noise  and  air  pollution  along  with  reduced  average  fuel \nconsumption is expected because of reductions in projected traffic growth volumes on the transit \ncorridors (in a without-project scenario).  \n \n28.  Temporary adverse environmental impacts are expected largely during the construction \nphase of the project involving elements such as the elevated and underground sections of the \nmetro rail alignment, stations, maintenance depots, and casting yards. The project management \nhas ensured that adequate mitigation measures have been taken to reduce these impacts. \n \n29.  According to initial environmental impact assessments, BMRC has already incorporated \nseveral measures to mitigate any environmental impacts, including noise reduction measures \nthrough  installing  soundproof  walls  and  soundproofing  pads,  and  air  quality  monitoring \nequipment placed all along the alignments. The Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore was \nappointed to monitor the groundwater level and quality during construction.  \n \n30.  The project has been classified as category B for environment under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) was carried out. \n \n31.  Some of the significant impacts and mitigation measures related to the project alignment \nare as follows: \n \n(i)  Proximity (about 40 meters) of one of the underground sections to the Tipu Sultan \nPalace, which is a heritage structure as per the Archaeological Survey of India \n(ASI),  has  been  addressed  on  the  basis  of  mitigation  measures  to  minimize \nvibration impacts as recommended by the National Physical Laboratories and the \nASI clearance conditions. The ASI has already accorded a formal clearance to \nBMRC  to  go  ahead  with  the  construction  based  on  the  National  Physical \nLaboratories study findings. \n(ii)  Tree  cutting  along  the  alignment  has  been  addressed  through  better  route \nplanning to avoid or bypass areas with thick vegetation and the implementation of \ncompensatory  forestation  programs  (on  a  1:10  basis)  in  pre-identified  public \nareas. The plantation program was verified and found satisfactory in terms of \nnative species, density, and survival rates. \n(iii)  Debris, spoil generation and disposal from tunneling of underground sections will \nbe mitigated by sound disposal in low-lying areas in the south of the city approved \n ", "8    \n \nby  the  Bruhat  Bengaluru  Mahanagara  Palike  (civic  administration).  Other \nmitigation measures on transportation of soil have been factored into the IEE. \n(iv)  BMRC has mainstreamed environmental mitigation into its contractual agreements \nsuch that all contractors involved in construction of the metro will be obliged to \nimplement  the  environmental  management  plan  and  ambient  monitoring \nprograms, conduct environmental, health and safety audits, and provide periodic \nreports to BMRC. Noncompliance and defaults will be followed up with necessary \naction.  BMRC  has  its  own  environmental  and  social  institutional  capacity  to \ncoordinate and supervise the implementation of environmental management plan \nmeasures. \n \n32.  Public consultation has been carried out by BMRC and suggestions and comments from \nthe community have been incorporated in the project design and execution. The IEE prepared for \nthe project captures all the above and will be disclosed on the ADB website in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n2.  Social Dimensions \n \n33.  Land  acquisition  for  the  project  was  initiated  in  2006  and  has  been  completed  in \naccordance with the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board Act. The total length of the \nproject corridor (metro line) is about 42.3 km connecting the north\u2013south and east\u2013west ends of \nBangalore city. The total land requirement for the project was 124 hectares (ha). Of this, 30 ha of \nland was private land and the remaining 94 ha of land was government land. There were 875 \nland parcels affected, of which 811 were private and the remaining 64 were government land. \nThe total number of affected households is 1,838. A detailed break up of land requirement for \neach corridor is available. \n \n34.  BMRC adopted a transparent approach for the acquisition of land and properties, cash \nassistance  for  rehabilitation,  and  appropriate  compensation  packages.  The  rehabilitation \npackages were developed and have been implemented and cash compensation has been paid \nto  the  affected  households  by  BMRC.  The  cash  assistance  included  a  shifting  allowance, \ninconvenience allowance, right to salvage material, transitional allowance, rental income loss \nallowance, business premises reestablishment allowance and a business loss allowance. In \naddition, BMRC is meeting the cost of restoring the affected portions of public property, including \na school, hospital, park and religious structure. Rehabilitation packages, designed for the benefit \nof persons who suffered loss of land, properties and income and livelihoods, have been paid \nsimultaneously with the compensation.  Additionally, affected slums were rehabilitated through a \nnew housing scheme developed in the Peenya area where the slum dwellers have been allotted \nhousing. BMRC has allotted and registered new houses for the slum dwellers in the name of \nwomen of the household which is in compliance with international best practices.  \n \n35.  A social due diligence audit has been carried out to assess whether land acquisition and \nresettlement  processes  and  their  implementation  complied  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and government guidelines. The social due diligence audit included consultations with \naffected local people to assess views on property acquisition, resettlement, and compensation \npackages and processes. These have been found to be largely favorable towards the BMRC \nprocesses, which have also been positively highlighted in the local media. The compensation \nwas paid at replacement value. BMRC has developed a rehabilitation package dealing with \nassistance to affected local people with eligibility and entitlements for various losses being, in \nprinciple, at par with the ADB\u2019s requirement under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. This is \nconsistent with international best practices.  ", "  9\n36.  Due diligence also identified eight pending cases of litigation related to compensation and \nresettlement. However, BMRC has already taken all necessary advance action steps, including \ndepositing compensation amounts with the court which will determine the grievance claims. \nSimilar cases have in the past been resolved quickly and amicably and generally in BMRC\u2019s \nfavor, since BMRC has remained committed to providing strong compensation and rehabilitation \npackages.  \n \n37.  The  project,  initially  categorized  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  based  on  preliminary \npublicly available information, has been recategorized as category C following ADB\u2019s detailed \nsafeguards assessment and detailed due diligence. This established that land acquisition and \nresettlement  and  rehabilitation  processes  have  been  completed  (in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement) and affected persons have all received compensation (excluding \nthe eight cases noted in para. 36). \n \n38.  The social due diligence report assessed the impacts on indigenous peoples; there are \nno indigenous peoples affected by the project. The project is categorized C for indigenous \npeoples.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Management \n \n39.  The project is being implemented by BMRC, the special-purpose company established by \nthe national and state governments for the project in 1994. BMRC will also carry out the project \noperations  and  management  once  the  metro  is  functioning.  BMRC's  board  comprises  13 \ndirectors, which includes five from the national government (urban development, railways, and \nthe  DMRC).  The  chair  of  BMRC  is  the  secretary  of  urban  development  of  the  national \ngovernment. There are five board members from the state government, including the managing \ndirector and principal secretary finance, and three functional directors who are experts in railway \ndevelopment and operations or transport engineering. The company has been operating as an \nindependent entity for several years and will agree in the ADB loan agreement to comply with \nsound corporate governance requirements.  \n \n2.  Construction Arrangements \n \n40.  BMRC has made good progress and the project is in an advanced stage of construction \nas reflected by the following milestones: (i) land acquisition is completed; (ii) \u201creach\u201d 18 is nearing \nTPF FPT\ncompletion  and  proposed  for  opening  by  early  2011;  (iii)  80%  of  the  contracts  have  been \nawarded, and the balance are under bid; (vi) train manufacture has commenced, with the first \ntrain having rolled out in the Republic of Korea in September 2010.9 \nTPF FPT\n \n3.  Operations Arrangements \n \n41.  BMRC will be the project operator responsible for recruiting operation and maintenance \nstaff. The operations manual, safety manual and requirements, procedures, and staff training will \nbe provided by the general consultants. This is in line with the practice followed by the DMRC for \n                                                 \n8  The project is divided into four \u201creaches\u201d and underground portions. Reach 1 of 6.5 km with six stations extends \nTP PT\nfrom Cricket Stadium to Byappanahalli station. \n9  The procurement followed a global tender, in which four international consortia were short listed prior to obtaining \nTP PT\ncompetitive price quotations. The tender also had a technology transfer element to an Indian domestic company. \n ", "10    \n \nDelhi. Indian Railways has a large pool of trained traffic controllers and these may also be \nseconded to BMRC for train operations. BMRC has proposed that noncritical functions should be \noutsourced through suitable contracts.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n42.  BMRC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire BMRC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and the BMRC will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n5.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n \n43.  BMRC will report to ADB on the progress of the project procurement, construction, and \ninitial operation, as well as the financial statements, business plan, and indebtedness plan. \nConstruction and procurement progress and initial operations will be reviewed by the lenders\u2019 \ntechnical consultant and assessed against the project\u2019s schedule, specifications, and budget. \nDisbursements of ADB\u2019s loan will be conditional upon receipt by ADB of reports from the lenders\u2019 \ntechnical consultant satisfactory to ADB. BMRC will provide, among other things, semiannual \nunaudited financial statements, audited financial statements, and annual business plans which \ninclude  projected  financial  statements,  a  capital  expenditure  plan,  and  confirmation  of \ncompliance with financial covenants for the next financial year. BMRC will submit the annual \nindebtedness  plan  for  ADB\u2019s  approval,  and  BMRC  is  obliged  to  comply  with  the  annual \nindebtedness plan for the next financial year. BMRC also will provide an annual review of \ncompliance  with  environmental  and  social  safeguards  pursuant  to  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n  \n1.  Instrument and Amount \n \n44.  The proposed ADB loan is of up to $250 million to BMRC, a special-purpose company \nestablished to develop, operate, and maintain the project. The loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources without government guarantee.  \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance  \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s support for the project is justified based on the following: \n \n(i)  Urban infrastructure development is often financed mainly by grants from the \ngovernment, contributions from municipal government finances, or by multilateral \nfinance  institutions  backed  by  sovereign  government  guarantees.  The  capital \ninvestment for financing urban infrastructure in India is estimated at $1.2 trillion ", " 11\nfrom 2011 to 2030 and $2.2 trillion10 if operating expenditures are included. To \nPF FP\nmeet  such  volumes  of  investment,  a  paradigm  shift  is  required  in  sourcing \nfinancing, including exploring new sources, the efficient application of these funds, \nand efficient management of assets created so as to minimize operating costs (or \noverall life cycle costs) to ensure sustainability. To effect this shift in financing, \ninstitutional  accountability,  good  corporate  governance,  planned  urban \ndevelopment, and effective leveraging of government grants are a prerequisite. \nADB\u2019s participation, and compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements, will help promote \nstrong  governance,  robust  institutional  accountability,  and  overall  efficiency  in \noperations.   \n(ii)  Few financial institutions have the ability to structure appropriate financial models \nand  the  appetite  to  lend  long-term  funds  to  capital-intensive  public  service \nprojects. The creation of a dedicated institutional vehicle for managing life cycle \ncosts  of  public  infrastructure  with  due  accountability,  good  governance,  and \nleveraging government grant funds or viability gap funding support will help to \ncatalyze additional finance for the project. ADB\u2019s participation, capital structuring, \nand due diligence will help mobilize long-term debt funding and catalyze domestic \nfinancial institutions such as banks and insurance funds to consider long-term \nloans for this project. Similar structuring for other projects with viability gap funding \ncan effectively replicate this model. \n(iii)  Compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguards will ensure proper \nresolution of social issues and mitigation of adverse environmental impacts, if any. \n \nC.  Assurances  \n \n46.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),11 \nTPF FPT\nthe Government of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to BMRC. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$250,000,000 to the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation for the Bangalore Metro Rail Transit \nSystem Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.  \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n9 March 2011 \n \n                                                 \n10 Mckinsey and Company. 2010.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nConsistent with the country partnership strategy (CPS) for India's 3-year assistance program (2009\u20132012)a and \nP P\nspecifically with the CPS emphasis on environmental improvement and Climate Change Implementation Plan (2009\u2013\n2011) and recommended financing of \"MRT [mass rapid transit] projects in medium sized Indian cities,\" the project \nhas a positive impact on economic growth for poverty reduction. The project aims at (i) environmental improvement \nthrough clean transport, (ii) effective urban transportation for economic growth, and (iii) the development of a \nbankable project structure as a model for catalyzing private sector funding, all of which are regarded as central goals \nof Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).b The project supports ADB's private sector development \nP P\nstrategy by establishing a bankable financial model for a large infrastructure project without sovereign guarantee, \nwhich will catalyze private sector participation and attract financing from commercial financiers into other such \nprojects in India. The project strongly supports the CPS for India by supporting the transport sector (a priority area), \nas well as other thematic priority areas noted in the CPS such as environmental sustainability, private sector \ndevelopment, and private sector operations. Consistent with ADB's urban sector, financial sustainability, and social \nsafeguards focus, the project supports self-sustainability of urban sector projects, which is in line with ADB\u2019s urban \ntransport strategy for local governments to self-finance and sustain urban development projects without dependence \non central government finances. ADB support provides crucial credibility for the project, which has several pioneering \naspects: (i) new public transport modality, (ii) institutional development, and (iii) project financing structures. The \nproject supports implementation of metro rail-based public transport systems. These are crucial for providing cost-\neffective connectivity, especially in middle-sized Indian cities currently suffering from public transport gaps and \nexponential private vehicular growth leading to growth in pollution, accidents, and travel delays. Overall, successful \nproject implementation will catalyze similar projects in other local municipal governments, leading to better public \ntransport development in Indian cities and, crucially, spurring commercial finance into the sector, thus effecting a \nbetter use of limited government funds. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n \n1.  Key issues. The prime impact of the project is on developing effective mass connectivity solutions for urban \ncenters and thus aiding overall economic growth. By providing a sustainable public urban transport modality in \nBangalore city, the Metro Rail Transit System Project has an indirect impact on poverty reduction through both cost \nand time savings which can be factored in at various levels, including (i) reduced average travel costs per km versus \nprivate vehicular transport, (ii) reduced time delays in travel due to a dedicated travel corridor, and (iii) improved \nhealth costs over a longer period due to anticipated lower vehicular emissions in the city. In addition, through the \ndevelopment of a citywide transport grid, the project covers a large catchment area of the city providing accessibility \nto both low- and middle-income workers to attractive labor markets in the developing industrial and commercial parts \nof the city. The project's key outcomes will be the implementation of a metro rail system in the city and the limited \nrecourse finance model. Benefits include (i) the provision of sustainable public transport for the city's 8.5 million \npopulation by 2012, providing an alternative to private vehicles; (ii) traffic decongestion and faster travel times versus \nthe status quo of growing private vehicle traffic, aiding in improving traffic accident rates, time saving for commuters, \nincreased productivity and hence economic growth; (iii) environmental improvement by providing a more energy \nefficient mass urban transport system (energy requirements estimated to be a fraction of the comparable road-based \nsystems) as well as through reducing fuel consumption and pollution impacts from private vehicles, considered to be \na key factor in urban pollution growth in recent years; (iv) the demonstration of sustainable financial and operations \nmanagement through a dedicated urban transport company; (v) demonstration of \u201cbankability\u201d structuring through the \nlimited recourse financing model and credit enhancement mechanisms able to catalyze further commercial financing; \nand (vi) demonstration of the use of property realizations to provide an innovative revenue source for financing \ninfrastructure, linked to land use planning and efficient spatial development. The project benefits the urban poor and \nmiddle class by providing a cheaper, safer, and more efficient public transport system. \n  ", "Appendix 2           15 \n \n2. Design features. No direct impact on poverty is envisaged as a result of the implementation of this project. \nNonetheless, the project will have indirect impacts on Bangalore, Karnataka, and India as a whole. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nA social impact assessment was conducted as part of the preparation of environmental impact assessment reports. \nBangalore city has a population of 5.70 million according to the census statistics for 2001, as against the city\u2019s earlier \npopulation of 2.92 million in 1981 and 4.13 million in 1991. This shows that the population has nearly doubled in the \nlast 20 years, and the growth rate is currently around 3.8% annually. The geographical boundaries of the city are also \nexpanding rapidly, as evident from the census data, which showed the city area as 386 square kilometers (km2) in \n1981, 446 km2 in 1991, and 531 km2 in 2001. With increasing population and reduced available land area, the cPitPy\u2019s \npopulation denP sPity was 7,983 personPsP per km2 in 1981, 9,260 persons per km2 in 1991, and 10,710 persons per km2 \nP P P P P P\nin 2001. It is further projected that the population size of the Bangalore urban agglomeration will be around 7.8 million \nin 2011 and 11.0 million in 2021. A city of this size with a rapidly rising population of the above magnitude demands a \nwhole range of civic services, including the vital transportation sector. The per capita income at current prices in \nurban areas only is Rs28,305; 83.91% of the people are literate. There are 77 hospitals, 31 dispensaries, 2,772 \nprimary schools, 1,177 high schools, 209 pre-university schools, 24 engineering colleges, and 4 universities. One-\nquarter of the people sampled in the east\u2013west corridor and 41% in the north\u2013south corridor are from lower economic \nbackgrounds. The higher-income group is the smallest group, and the middle- and lower-income groups are the \nbiggest; 75% of the people sampled in both the east\u2013west and north\u2013south corridors are business people. In terms of \neducational background, 6.25% of the people sampled in the east\u2013west corridor are illiterate; in the north\u2013south \ncorridor there were no illiterate people in the sample; 29% of the people sampled in the east\u2013west corridor and almost \n45% in the north\u2013south corridor are graduates. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nConsultations were carried out with all the stakeholders during the preparation of the project. As an integral part of \nland acquisition, affected communities and affected people were directly and fully involved in the project. All \nstakeholders were informed and the stream of information will continue during the implementation of the project. \nConsultations were held to ensure participation and minimization of the negative impacts. Different techniques of \nconsultation  with  stakeholders  were  used  during  project  preparation\u2014public  opinion,  public  meetings,  group \ndiscussions, and interactive sessions, etc. Given the chaotic urban road traffic, public opinion makers were asked \nwhether a metro rail system would be a viable alternative to the existing modes of transport;  91% of the sample felt \nthat it could be a viable, quick, comfortable and safe means of transport, and thus should be welcomed. To \nunderstand the socioeconomic profile of the affected persons, questionnaires were designed and information was \ncollected from the 788 households. An interactive meeting was held with members of the public, media, and \nconcerned environmental groups at Bangalore University Senate Hall, when the salient features of the metro rail \nproject for Bangalore along with its projected benefits to the community and environmental and socioeconomic \nimpacts were explained by the project proponents. This was followed by intense discussions and a question and \nanswer session. On the basis of deliberations, a consensus emerged from the meeting that the metro rail project \nimplementation would result in a better mode of transport with a wide range of benefits to the community. Additionally, \nconsultations were held during the due diligence study after the land acquisition period, and these showed people\u2019s \nsupport for the project and the smooth process of land acquisition. Consultation will be continued during project \nimplementation.  \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n \nC&P was considered as a part of the more extensive resettlement planning exercise. Local communities and affected \npeople were consulted throughout the preparation process to minimize impacts, ensure social acceptance, and \nincrease equitability. The process will continue during the implementation of the project. Views and concerns of all \nstakeholders will be taken into consideration and addressed whenever feasible. Finally, local customs, religious \npractices, and traditional activities have been considered as a fully integrated part of the preparation process to avoid \ndiscrimination  and/or  disruption  of  activities.  The  executing  and  implementing  agency  (Bangalore  Metro  Rail \nCorporation  [BMRC])  will  ensure  that  essential  participation  process  will  be  continued  throughout  the  project \nimplementation. \n \n ", "16          Appendix 2           \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key issues. No particular issue is expected to arise from the implementation of the project. The project will have \na positive impact on women. Gender impacts of transport projects are generally favorable. It is evident that availability \nof a better metro rail system and safe connectivity with better transport services will benefit the women of the area. \nTheir mobility will be improved in terms of access to social services, higher levels of schooling, and better health \nfacilities, etc. Additionally, during the project implementation, efforts will be made by the project authority for women to \nreceive preferential treatment for employment in the civil works, with proper health safeguards. The executing agency \nwill ensure that affected women are consulted and invited to participate in group-based activities to enable them to \ngain access to and control over resources. \n2.
