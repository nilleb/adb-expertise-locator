Hera Port was one of 25 fish-\nlanding sites developed under the Fisheries Infrastructure Sector\nProject.  Construction  was  finished  in  1993,  however,\nsubsequently  the  port  deteriorated.  Following  the  extensive\nupheaval  and  destruction  experienced  in  East  Timor  in\nSeptember  1999,  almost  all  of  the  larger  commercial  offshore\nfishing vessels have left. Around 24 were taken to nearby Atauro\nIsland.  Hera  Port  has  subsequently  been  used  for  activities\nrelated to the peacekeeping operations in East Timor; no fishing\nvessels have returned.\nThe Fisheries and Marine Environmental Service (FMES) in the\nDivision  of  Agricultural  Affairs  has  embarked  on  an  ambitious\nstrategic development plan for East Timor\u2019s fisheries. One of the\nplan\u2019s cornerstones is a precautionary approach for developing\ninshore fisheries by targeting the much larger and robust pelagic\nresources offshore. Rehabilitation of the fishing harbor basin will\nprovide the future government of East Timor with one of the tools\nnecessary  to  implement  a  responsible  fisheries  management\nregime. An operational fishing harbor will provide basic support\nservices and thus act as a strong incentive for the return and\noperation of the fishing vessels currently located at Atauro Island,\nand act as a catalyst to shift fishing effort to the offshore fisheries.\nClassification Poverty intervention\nEconomic growth\nEnvironmental Environmental category B. An initial environmental examination\nAssessment was undertaken and the summary is in Appendix 5.\nRationale East Timor\u2019s coastline is only about 650 kilometers (km) long,\nmost with little or no coral reef. No areas of barrier reef or sea\nmounts are within reach of the small-scale sector. The island has\nvery little continental shelf; depths of 200 meters (m) are reached\nwithin 2-8 km of the shore, and depths of 2,000 to 3,000 m within\n20 km. All coastal demersal resources are limited to a narrow\nstretch of steep to fairly steeply sloping seabed.\nFisheries restoration and most future development plans are likely\nto be based on East Timor\u2019s pelagic resources, including small\npelagic species such as Indian mackerel, scad, sardines, and the\nsmall  tuna.  In  due  course,  skills  will  be  developed  to  exploit\nresources of the high-value larger tuna species.\nCoral reef fisheries will be liable to overfishing if placed under\nconcerted  commercial  fishing  pressure.  Probably  only  local\nindigenous fishers should be allowed to fish coral reefs.", "iii\nObjective and Scope The Project\u2019s overall objective is to contribute to sustained food\nsecurity of marine protein for the East Timorese. The goal is to\nachieve responsible fisheries management by promoting offshore\npelagic fisheries and thus ease the inshore fishing pressure. This\nwill  be  achieved  by  rehabilitating  the  necessary  harbor\ninfrastructure  facilities  at  Hera  Port  for  larger  offshore  fishing\nvessels.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $1 million equivalent.\nThe Project will be entirely financed on a grant basis from the\nTrust Fund for East Timor (TFET). Funds for the TFET have been\ncommitted by donors. The International Development Association\n(IDA) of the World Bank Group is the trustee of the TFET. IDA\nand the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are responsible for jointly\nmanaging the TFET funds.\nImplementation Under  East  Timor\u2019s  Second  Agriculture  Rehabilitation  Project\nArrangements (ARP  II),  which  is  administered  by  IDA,  $1 million  has  been\nallocated for a fisheries component. ADB has been requested to\nprepare  and  administer  this  component.  The  United  Nations\nTransitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) will be the\ninitial recipient of the grant from the TFET and will use the existing\nproject management unit (PMU) of the ARP II, with support from\nFMES staff, to execute the Project.\nThe PMU will oversee project implementation and coordinate the\nvarious  activities  between  the  contractor  and  the  individual\nmonitoring  consultant.  In  particular,  the  PMU  will  program,\nadminister,  and  coordinate  daily  project  activities  and  be\nresponsible for recruiting a contractor for the construction and\nassociated work at Hera Port. Recruitment will be undertaken in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures. A domestic\nconsultant will be engaged to act as quality control guarantor and\nto closely liaise with the contractor in sourcing local materials,\nobtaining quotations for procurement, and ensuring quality and\nquantities meet specifications.\nProcurement Procurement  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement, save that the definition of \u201cmember\ncountries\u201d for purposes of procurement eligibility will, in addition to\nADB member countries, include East Timor and all donors and\nmembers  of  international  organizations  that  have  contributed\nfunds to the TFET. An imprest account will be established within\nthe PMU with a ceiling of $500,000, and operated according to\nADB\u2019s guidelines. The Project will finance imports of goods and\nservices,  local  purchases,  lease  of  machinery,  civil  works\nidentified under the Project, and consulting services. Under ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement, items may be procured off the shelf\n(direct purchase), or through international shopping or local or\ninternational competitive bidding, as appropriate.", "iv\nConsulting Services The Project will require 6 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices.  The  consultant  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  definition  of  \u201cmember\ncountries\u201d for purposes of consultant recruitment will include not\nonly ADB member countries but also East Timor, and all other\ndonors  and  members  of  international  organizations  that  have\ncontributed to the TFET.\nProject Benefits and The Project is expected to contribute to improved and sustained\nBeneficiaries food security of important animal protein for the population at\nlarge. It will also contribute to implementation of East Timor\u2019s\nstrategic plan to develop comprehensive fisheries management\nmeasures  that  will  set  the  scene  for  sustainable  fisheries\nmanagement practices.\nSocial Issues and The  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  significant  positive  social\nPoverty impact by contributing to (i) sustainability of the marine capture\nfisheries, (ii) supply of affordable smaller pelagic fish species, and\n(iii) diversification of the inshore areas, e.g., tourism (diving) and\nmarine protected areas.\nFor  the  detailed  design  phase  prior  to  actual  construction,\nextensive fisher group consultations will be carried out to identify\nthe most suitable compromise in design to accommodate small-\nscale canoes together with larger offshore vessels.\nThe Project will involve no relocation or resettlement. No land\nacquisition is required as Hera Port and the surrounding area are\non government land.", "v", "vi", "I.  THE PROJECT\n1. I submit for your information the following report on a project grant to East Timor, as\ncurrently  administered  by  the  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor\n(UNTAET) from the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), for the Hera Port Fisheries Facilities\nRehabilitation Project.1 The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. UNTAET, in consultation with the East Timor Transitional Administration, the National\nCouncil of East Timor, and members of East Timor's civil society, asked the International\nDevelopment Agency (IDA) of the World Bank Group, in its capacity as trustee of the TFET, to\nprovide  assistance  from  the  TFET  to  rehabilitate  the  fishing  harbor  at  Hera  Port.  IDA\nsubsequently  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  in  its  capacity  as  joint\nimplementing agency (along with IDA) of the TFET, to administer this project and the funds\nwere  made  available  as  a  special  grant  in  conjunction  with  the  IDA-implemented  Second\nAgriculture  Rehabilitation  Project  (ARP  II).  An  ADB  mission2  prepared  the  Project  with\nauthorized UNTAET and East Timor Transitional Administration (ETTA) representatives. The\nagreements  reached  were  confirmed  in  an  aide  memoire.  The  Project  was  prepared  in\naccordance with the Joint Management Arrangements for the TFET.3 The TFET does not\ninclude ADB's own resources.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n3. Accurate historical data is not available for inshore fisheries in East Timor in terms of\ncurrent fishing effort (boats, gear, fishers), or the extent of coastal living marine resources. An\nIndonesian statistical report on the number of fishing gear units in East Timor published in 19974\nidentified 630 fishing vessels with outboard engines, with 349 in Dili alone, and 1,387 canoes.\nAlso, in 1997, 9,066 fishers caught a total of 2,423 tons of marine fish. Available data and\ninformed anecdotal information indicate that the Indonesian withdrawal resulted in substantial\nlosses of fishing gear and vessels. Several surveys have tried to calculate the actual losses, but\ntoo many error factors were encountered to give an accurate assessment.\n4. Current information on the extent of coastal living marine resources and habitats is very\nsparse. A study commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme5 considered\nenvironmental  needs  and  priorities  in  East  Timor,  and  gathered  comments  on  the  marine\nenvironment:\n(i)  The (marine) ecosystem if used in a nondestructive and well-planned manner,\nwill  provide  great  possibilities  for  economic  development  while  providing  the\nnecessary products to sustain the local population.\n                  \n1  The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 July 2001.\n2  The mission comprised T. Gloerfelt-Tarp, Natural Resources Specialist (Mission Leader); T. O\u2019Donnell, Economist\nand ADB staff consultant; and J. Fleming, Engineer and ADB staff consultant.\n3  R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, approved on 23 March 2000.\n4  Regional Development Planning Board of East Timor Province and Central Board of Statistics of East Timor\nProvince, East Timor in Figures, (1997), 322pp.\n5  Sandlund, O. et al. 2000.

Small-scale artisanal fishers are most dependent on fish resources\nclose to the shore.\n5. The East Timorese coastal zone is characterized by a narrow or nonexistent continental\nshelf, a limited amount of fringing coral reef, and a number of fragile ecosystem pockets\n(mangroves,  sea  grasses,  etc.).  These  areas  are  likely  to  support  limited  coastal  marine\nresources. As the economy recovers, the demand (and markets) for fisheries resources will\nincrease and early attention will be required to ensure sustainability of target species.\n6. East Timor is faced with the dual task of trying to restore its fishery and at the same time\ntrying  to  promote  a  sustainable  fishery,  avoiding  the  numerous  failed  tropical  fisheries\ninterventions that have been the hallmark of the sector. Judging from other similar areas of\nmarine waters, a conservative estimate points to a minimum sustainable harvest per year of\naround  15,000  tons.  The  minimum  recommended  fish  consumption  per  capita  per  year\naccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations of 13 kilograms\n(kg) would require production of 9,400 tons just to satisfy the recommended need of East\nTimor\u2019s population.\n7. The fisheries sector, nevertheless, offers considerable potential not only to sustain the\nimportant subsistence subsector, but also for job creation in commercial activities and related\ndownstream activities, e.g., marketing, processing, provisioning, servicing, etc. Once East Timor\nhas  an  accepted  exclusive  economic  fishing  zone,  the  offshore  resources  will  be  fully\naccessible. During Indonesian rule of the country these resources were off-limits to the East\nTimorese and were harvested by Indonesian fishers primarily from Sulawesi.\n8. The Indonesian withdrawal caused a void of personnel in fisheries administration, which\nis only slowly being filled, albeit with a lot less people. This is a deliberate strategy by the\nFisheries  and  Marine  Environment  Service  (FMES),  which  will  focus  on  management,\nlegislation, policies, and enforcement issues, and leave the practical and commercial aspects to\nthe  private  sector.  A  major  task,  however,  will  be  to  cut  through  the  leftover  inefficient\nbureaucracy; East Timor will need foreign assistance in the foreseeable future to achieve its\nobjectives as stipulated in its  strategic plan for fisheries.6\n9. The  development  and  management  of  a  sustainable  fisheries  sector  will  directly\ncontribute to poverty reduction by increasing (i) the availability of fish products at affordable\nprices  to  the  local  population,  especially  the  least  well-off  in  the  coastal  areas;  and  (ii)\nemployment  and  thereby  income  generation  in  private  sector  production  and  commercial\nactivities.\nB.  Policies and Plans\n10. Despite the transitional nature of the current administration, the Cabinet member for the\nDepartment of Economic Affairs has officially endorsed the FMES strategic plan for fisheries.\nThis plan sets out nine goals: (i) sustain and enhance the aquatic resources of East Timor, and\ntheir supporting ecosystems; (ii) establish and implement a fisheries act and accompanying\n                  \n6  Fisheries and Marine Environment Service. 2001. Fish for the Future: A Strategic Plan for the Fisheries of East\nTimor. Dili.", "3\nlegislation; (iii) address the needs and aspirations of coastal communities, community members,\nand social groups; (iv) establish a profitable private sector-based fishing industry that maximizes\nsustainable economic returns for East Timor; (v) establish a viable aquaculture industry; (vi)\nprovide sustainable marine recreational activities for the recreational fishing, charter fishing, and\ndive tour subsectors; (vii) assert jurisdiction and control over the living marine resources in the\nseas surrounding East Timor; (viii) develop the capacity of staff of FMES and other service\nproviders; and (ix) operate an efficient and accountable FMES.\n11. FMES has clearly incorporated the lessons learned from other countries\u2019 failed fisheries.\nThe most profound change is the acknowledgement that the private sector must undertake the\nactual  fishing  activities  and  associated  businesses,  and  the  government  must  provide  the\nenabling  business  environment  and  framework  within  which  to  operate.  Such  an\nacknowledgement is in conformity with ADB\u2019s policy on fisheries.7\n12. Hera Port will probably be the first location where FMES can implement its private sector\ndrive. Within the port area are an operational ice factory, a new training workshop, an old\nboatyard, a broken-down slipway, some new barracks, and other buildings. The ice factory is in\nthe process of being privatized; FMES anticipates that all activities that can be commercially\nviable, e.g., workshops, boat building, stores, fuel supply, etc., will be privatized. Such a policy\nensures the sustainability of the Project, as every commercial enterprise within the port area will\nhave a vested interest in a functional port.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n13. ADB has provided technical assistance (TA) to collect the baseline data necessary to\nnegotiate the exclusive economic zone.8 Australia (i) has a small boat-building project and\nprovided engine maintenance training, both at Hera Port, (ii) is helping deploy fish-aggregating\ndevices in the vicinity of Hera Port, (iii) has pledged its support to fund initial stock assessment\nof the inshore waters, and (iv) has expressed interest in supporting necessary legislation for a\nnew fisheries act. Iceland is following up with a canoe-building training project. The People\u2019s\nRepublic of China supplied 70 containers of fishing gear, iceboxes, and outboard motors; and\nADB has provided individual consulting input for a strategy and actual distribution of the fishing\ngear.  The  World  Bank  is  helping  rehabilitate  inland  aquaculture  through  its  agriculture\nrehabilitation program.\n14. Assistance to the sector has largely been driven by FMES, which has been approaching\nthe immediate needs very methodically by first analyzing the future role of government and then\nproceeding  to  prioritize  the  interventions  necessary  to  achieve  this  role.  Thus,  a  fisheries\ncomponent was included under the ARP II (para. 2) and IDA subsequently asked ADB to\nimplement this component. ADB is keeping frequent contact with the larger traditional donors\nwithin the fisheries sector: Australia, Japan, and New Zealand.\nD.  Poverty Situation\n15. East Timor experienced massive political, economic, and social upheaval from August\n1999 to September 1999, exacerbating previously high poverty levels. By mid-2000, security\nwas being restored. Farming is the primary occupation of 85 percent of household heads. Cash\n                  \n7  ADB. 1997. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Fisheries.

The poor are characterized by a\nlack of education and low literacy, high dependency burdens, and dependence on agriculture.\n16. Using the survey data from the ADB-funded rapid assessment of economic and social\nconditions9 as the basis for estimating poverty from 1999 to mid-2000, the incidence of poverty\nhas  climbed  significantly,  reaching  around  75  percent.  Prior  to  this,  based  on  the  official\nIndonesian poverty line, the incidence of poverty fell from around 37 percent in 1993 to around\n25 percent in 1997, but from 1997 to 1999 it climbed back to 37 percent due to the financial\ncrisis and political upheaval. Prior to 1998, the gap between the average income of the poor and\nthe poverty line\u2014poverty gap index\u2014was 2 percent. From 1998, the poverty gap has steadily\nincreased to about 7 percent in the first half of 2001.\n1.  Pro-Poor Growth and Interventions\n17. East Timor is now emerging from the massive upheavals that followed the vote for\nindependence in August 1999. The country is currently being administered by UNTAET and the\ndevelopment  thrust  is  understandably  on  rehabilitating  infrastructure.  The  damaged\ninfrastructure  has  hindered  the  implementation  of  aid  and  development  programs,  slowed\nrepatriation efforts, been a barrier to marketing of crops and to economic growth in general,\nreduced access to basic services, and tended to reinforce the isolation of rural communities.\n18. Most of the core poverty, and poverty interventions overseen by UNTAET have focused\non  rebuilding  sustainable  infrastructure  that  will  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  future\ninterventions for the poor. Several agencies have followed this lead and have carried out much\nplanning and implementation of interventions during the transition period. ADB is implementing\nthree growth-oriented projects, which may not have a direct short run impact but are envisaged\nto have sustained poverty reduction impact over the long term. Current ADB initiatives are\n(i) emergency infrastructure rehabilitation of roads and bridges, and to a certain extent also\nports;  (ii) rehabilitation  of  water  and  sanitation  services;  and  (iii)  microfinance  delivery.  In\naddition, ADB is providing several TAs: (i) poverty assessment and statistics, (ii) community\nempowerment, (iii) transport sector rehabilitation, (iv) capacity building for governance and\npublic  sector  management,  (v)  rehabilitation  of  telecommunications,  (vi)  small-scale\nmicrofinance and microfinance policy and regulation, (vii) environmental assessment capacity,\n(viii) capacity building for local governments, and (ix) an economic policy forum.\n2.  Governance\n19. The new nation of East Timor will face many governance challenges.  Democratic\nprocesses are in the process of being introduced. Self-government is a relatively new and\nemerging concept. The challenge will be to rebuild trust as a first step to participating in\ngovernment, especially at the local level. Good governance requires a skills base to provide\nbasic  government  services.  Basic  education,  preventive  health  care,  family  planning,  and\nimproved agricultural production are the priority areas for investment and capacity building.\nImportant infrastructure is needed to facilitate the delivery of education and health services, and\nto stimulate commercial activity, especially in the agriculture sector. The reconstruction and\nstaffing of schools and health clinics are also priorities. The speedy reconstruction of land\ntransport infrastructure is critical to economic development.\n                  \n9  ADB. 2000. East Timor Rapid Assessment of Economic and Social Conditions. Dili.", "5\n3.  Social Development\n20. Education indicators are generally poor. Literacy rates were last officially recorded in\n1986 when literacy was 51 percent on a national basis, and 64 percent among adults. Evidence\nsuggests that education enrollment has a distinct gender bias. For example, in 1998, 52 percent\nof females over 10 years of age had never been to school. Postprimary education is still\ndisrupted, and literacy among the rural poor is less than 50 percent.\n21. The upheaval in 1999 had a serious impact on health services. Most facilities have been\ndamaged, and 130 of 160 physicians have departed. Existing services in rural communities are\nextremely  limited.  However,  emergency  services  are  in  place  provided  by  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) and donors. Prior to 1999, life expectancy was around 55 to 58 years.\nInfant mortality was moderately high at 85 deaths per 1,000 births, and medical staff attended\nonly 37 percent of all births. The under-five mortality rate was moderately high at 124 deaths per\n1,000 births, and immunization rates varied from 60-90 percent. Only 25 percent of villages had\na health clinic, and the average distance to a hospital was 75 kilometers (km).\nE.  Lessons Learned\n22. Past  fisheries  projects  have  often  been  synonymous  with  failures.  The  objectives\nfocused  on  (i)  increasing  catches  by  increasing  the  number  and  size  of  vessels,  and  (ii)\nincreasing quality by providing ice factories and cold storage. The difficulties in assessing fish\nstocks  and  the  unregulated  nature  of  most  fisheries  (open  access)  inevitably  lead  to\nconsiderable overcapitalization of the industry and subsequent declining catch rates. Another\nimportant lesson learned is the incompatible mix of direct government involvement in the sector\ntogether with the commercial operators. Sound business practices were compromised by social\nobligations to government employment, and government officials employed in the fisheries were\nnot accountable for the quality of day-to-day services, such as facilitating efficient fish landing\noperations; and providing market mechanisms, and repair and maintenance facilities when\nneeded.\n23. For East Timor, this is the most opportune time to implement responsible fisheries\nmanagement with emphasis on sustainability of the sector. The strategic plan for fisheries\n(footnote 6) has clearly taken the lessons learned into consideration. This alone is, of course,\nnot a guarantee against failures in the future, but the prioritization of the precautionary approach\nto the development of the fisheries sector further underpins the justification for this Project.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n24. Given that East Timor is still under transitional administration by the United Nations,\nformalized  policy  dialogue  with  a  national  government  has  not  been  possible.  However,\ncontinuous consultations with FMES have been undertaken and a progressive approach to\nfisheries development agreed upon, based on the strategic plan. Furthermore, the World Bank\nand ADB have collaborated closely on the selection of consultants for fisheries projects to\nensure  that  lessons  learned  from  other  fisheries  projects  are  given  a  high  priority.  The\nformulation of the strategic plan for fisheries received substantial input from one of the fielded\nconsultants under World Bank funding. The strategic plan conforms to both World Bank and\nADB precautionary policies for the capture fisheries sector.", "6\nIV.  THE PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n25. The absence of a functional fishing harbor in East Timor makes it very difficult\u2014if not\nimpossible\u2014for FMES to implement responsible fisheries management. The limited inshore\nresource needs a very controlled fishing effort to ensure its sustainability. However, the offshore\nresources are robust and fast growing, and offer an opportunity for limited development. The\nvessels for such an offshore-based fishery need a dedicated fisheries harbor as a base, as the\nvessels are too large to beach. Hera Port was built under a previous ADB loan10 and was only\ncompleted in 1993. However, problems in visiting East Timor at that time meant that maintaining\nclose  monitoring  of  the  project  was  difficult.  Construction  inadequacies  have  caused  the\nstructures to rapidly deteriorate.\n26. The fisheries harbor rehabilitation at Hera will provide improved mooring and unloading\nfacilities, and act as a center for the receipt, processing, and distribution of fish for Dili and\nbeyond. Facilities are also available to supply ice, provide training, repair and maintenance for\nmarine engines and other fishing equipment, and boat building and/or repair. Once the harbor is\nrehabilitated, Atauro fishers11 will likely be the first to relocate their fishing vessels to Hera. The\ndevelopment  of  a  pelagic  fishing  fleet  will,  however,  take  several  years  as  the  level  of\ninvestment and training will require time. In the near to medium term, the navy will place its two\npatrol vessels, primarily for fisheries surveillance but also for customs duties, along the pier to\nthe  east  just  outside  the  harbor  basin.  These  activities  are  very  positive  for  the  overall\ndevelopment of Hera Port as they will naturally attract more activities and scope for private\nsector enterprises. At this stage, no significant conservation concerns exist. The sustainability\n(more in terms of local depletions than biodiversity) of intensive fishing on small pelagics will\nneed to be considered in the longer term.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n27. The Project\u2019s overall objective is to contribute to sustained food security of marine\nprotein for the East Timorese. The goal is to achieve responsible fisheries management by\npromoting the offshore pelagic fisheries and thus ease pressure on inshore fisheries. This will\nbe achieved by rehabilitating the necessary harbor infrastructure facilities at Hera Port for the\nlarger offshore fishing vessels. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n28. The Project is relatively modest in scope comprising the rehabilitation and strengthening\nof three individual breakwaters totaling approximately 140 m in length, and rehabilitation of the\nwharf faces of the harbor basin totaling approximately 400 m. The work will include replenishing\nwashed-away core material from the breakwaters and enforcing the seaward sides with stone\narmor. This will achieve the required height of the breakwaters to protect the harbor basin\nagainst wave action at all tides. Precast concrete slabs anchored in profiled steel piles will\nenforce the wharf faces inside the harbor basin. This will create a secured mooring site for easy\non-  and  offloading  of  all  vessels.  The  working  apron  alongside  the  wharves  will  also  be\nupgraded and/or rehabilitated. The Project will emphasize as much use of local labor, local\npurchase  of  materials,  and  lease  and  hire  of  equipment  from  East  Timorese  as  possible.\n                  \n10 Loan No. 693-INO:Fisheries Infrastructure Sector Project, for $50 million, approved on 25 September 1984.\n11 Atauro is a small island approximately 20 km due north of Dili; the population is reputed to be the best all-round\nfishers.", "7\nFurthermore,  the  Project  will  incorporate  training  of  East  Timorese  at  all  levels  in  harbor\nconstruction as no such capacity is presently available in East Timor.\nC.  Technical Justification\n29. The Project has devised the most appropriate solutions to ensure (i) maximum local\nparticipation,  and  (ii)  minimum  maintenance.  For  the  breakwaters,  armor  rocks  of  correct\ndensity,  size,  and  hardness  have  been  identified  and  priced  from  sites  owned  by  local\npeople/communities. The transport of the armor rocks and the machinery necessary for placing\nthem on the breakwaters can all be sourced locally. The face-wall concrete slabs will all be\nprecast  using  local  labor  under  appropriate  supervision  by  international  and  domestic  civil\nengineers. The use of precast concrete slabs is a rather sophisticated method, but ensures\nminimum maintenance. With appropriate supervision and correct material use, available East\nTimor labor force should be able to carry out the work.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n30. The total project cost is estimated at about $1 million, including physical and price\ncontingencies. The TFET confirmed that the amount would be available in FY2001/02. Physical\ncontingencies (14.6 percent) are the same as used in previously approved ADB rehabilitation\nprojects  in  East  Timor,  but  higher  than  contingencies  under  ADB's  standard  procedures.\nHowever, they are considered justifiable for the events anticipated as administration passes\nfrom the United Nations to a newly elected civil government: (i) absence of insurance cover, (ii)\nlack of competitive environment, and (iii) private sector premiums. Detailed cost estimates are\nshown in Appendix 2.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Total Cost\nA. Base Costs\n1. Civil worksa 0.680\n2. Goods and related servicesb 0.150\n3.

The total cost of the Project will be out of the TFET. Contributions to the TFET do not\ninclude ADB resources.12 The financing will be by way of a grant and therefore there are no\nrepayments and no interest charges.\n                  \n12 The TFET budget for FY2001/02 designates $1.0 million for the fisheries sector.", "8\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management Unit\n32. The Project will use the World Bank\u2019s established project management unit (PMU) for\nthe ARP II within the Division of Agricultural Affairs. The PMU will oversee and coordinate the\nproject activities. FMES staff will participate actively in the PMU and shall administer the actual\nproject  implementation  including  issuing  of  tender  documents,  selection  of  contractor  and\nindividual consultant. Specific technical input for preparing bidding documents will be obtained\nfrom the ADB-established PMU for its infrastructure projects.\n2.  Procurement of Goods, Works, and Related Services\n33. The Project will be offered as one civil works contract through local competitive bidding\nprocedures  open  to  all  interested  contractors,  but  also  allowing  NGOs  with  experience  in\nconstruction to bid due to the inclusion of extensive use of local labor and training for the\nrehabilitation works.\n34. Where  possible,  all  civil  works  under  the  Project  will  incorporate  labor-intensive,\nemployment-generating  methodologies.  The  technical  solution  will  adopt  a  proper  balance\nbetween least-cost methodologies and the minimum maintenance requirement of the structures.\nHowever, precedence will at all times be given to quality of the work. A very important issue in\nthis  Project  is  to  provide  hands-on  training  to  East  Timorese  in  the  special  construction\ntechniques that apply to marine structures and the appropriate quality control.\n35. Consulting services will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. One domestic consultant will be engaged for approximately 6 person-months as a\ntechnical  adviser  and  quality  control  specialist  to  assist  the  PMU  in  (i)  monitoring  local\nprocurement, and (ii) providing quality checks of locally procured materials and of work during\nconstruction. The consultant will be responsible for the ultimate check that the local materials\nconform to the specifications of the purchase order. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix\n3.\n36. For purposes of procurement under the Project, the term \u201cmember countries\u201d will include\nADB member countries, East Timor, and all donors and members of international organizations\nthat have contributed funds to the TFET (footnote 3).\n3.  Implementation Schedule\n37. The Project will be implemented over approximately eight months, starting in October\n2001 and ending in May 2002. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 4.\n4.  Disbursement\n38. Disbursement for eligible expenditures will follow ADB\u2019s disbursement guidelines as set\nout  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook  and  may  be  made  as  direct  payment  or\nreimbursement, or through an imprest account. An imprest account will be established by the\nPMU and be replenished in accordance with the handbook. The PMU head will be responsible\nfor transactions, replenishments, and use of the imprest account. IDA, based on ADB requests,\nwill make payments under these agreements directly from the TFET.", "9\n39. If the contractor wishes the PMU to make direct payment to a supplier of goods and\nservices, the PMU will ask ADB to make use of the direct purchase procedures. ADB will\napprove the request and send it to IDA, which will pay the supplier directly. Request for payment\nwill  use  ADB\u2019s  standard  withdrawal  application.  The  PMU  will  indicate  in  the  withdrawal\napplication the date on which payment becomes due to the supplier. A separate application will\nbe filled out for each currency in which the payment is requested. The application will be\nsubmitted with supporting documents such as contracts, invoices, receipts, and vouchers. This\nprocedure can be used for payment of (i) contractor\u2019s fees, and (ii) equipment and goods\npurchased overseas.\n40. An  imprest  account  will  be  used  for  short-term  civil  works,  small-scale  design  and\nsupervision services, remuneration of East Timorese laborers, and direct purchases eligible for\nfinancing. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedure will be used to reimburse expenditures\nand to liquidate the imprest account for payments with value equal to or below $1,000. The\ncurrency of the imprest account will be the dollar and the ceiling will be $500,000. This is\njustified on the grounds of the relatively short project period of eight months and the need to\npurchase  most  of  the  materials  in  the  initial  three  months.  The  PMU  head  will  establish\nadequate  internal  control,  accounting,  and  audit  procedures  to  ensure  efficient  use  of  the\nimprest account and its operation.\n5.  Reports, Accounts, and Audits\n41. The contractor will be tasked to submit monthly summary reports. The PMU will provide\na  midterm  report,  approximately  four  months  after  commencement  of  the  Project,  on  the\nachievement of project objectives, progress and status of activities including expenditures, and\nany emerging difficulties. The midterm report will provide, in clear graphical presentations, the\nstatus of project progress and performance, and plans for the remainder of the work, including\nbudgets, and distribution and payment forecasts. In addition, the PMU will submit a final report\npromptly upon project completion.\n42. The PMU will establish an account in Dili, under control of the PMU head. The PMU will\nfurnish ADB with financial statements following international or other appropriate accounting\nstandards. Auditors acceptable to ADB will then audit the financial statements. The audited\nfinancial statements, together with the auditor\u2019s report, will be forwarded to ADB within six\nmonths of the end of the fiscal year.\n6.  Technical Midterm Review\n43. A technical review of the Project will be carried out three months after mobilization to\ndetermine any need to adjust the project design or implementation. The review will also assess\nthe adequacy of funds, cost overruns, need for reallocations, and other factors, if any, including\nassumptions and risks that may constrain satisfactory project implementation and achievement\nof the development objective.\nF.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n44. The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental\nexamination was carried out and the summary is in Appendix 5. As the Project only aims to\nrehabilitate the existing structures, and not construct additional structures, it will not have any", "10\nnegative environmental impact. In fact, the Project will, in the medium to long term contribute\npositively to the environment by containing the larger fishing vessels to a port where appropriate\nmeasures for the safe disposal of hazardous and polluting material can be implemented. The\nwithout-project situation will be an uncontrolled fishing fleet that can ignore rules and regulations\nbecause mooring and anchorage can be anywhere.\n45. Temporary adverse environmental impact will be experienced during the construction\nphase in the form of increased noise, dust, and traffic levels. The Implementing Agency will also\nbe informed that during religious services at the church nearby Hera Port, offensive noise and\ntraffic levels should be avoided. In general, however, the reestablishment of Hera Port as the\nonly fishing harbor in East Timor will not cause adverse effects for any of the villages in the\nvicinity of the port. The entire port area is government land connected to the main coastal road\nvia a short public road.\n2.  Social Analysis\n46. The Project is primarily growth oriented, but with a high long-term poverty reduction\nimpact. The collapse of the fishing industry has resulted in a very low supply of fish, and the\nhigh demand by the many foreigners has resulted in a price increase of around 600 percent in\nDili district, which effectively takes fish out of the diet of poor East Timorese because it is\nunaffordable. An initial social assessment is in Appendix 6.\n47. In the months of December through to March, agricultural production is severely and\nadversely  effected.  Traditionally  this  food  gap  is  filled  by  the  fishing  industry,  but  current\nconditions make this look unfeasible.\n48. The fisheries department has a strategic plan for the recovery of the fishing industry and\nthe rehabilitation of Hera fishing harbor is one of the catalysts for that recovery. The result will\nbe an increase in fish available in sufficient supply and at cheaper prices. In addition, the fishers\nwill have a safe harbor for protection from the seasonal northwesterly cyclones, and their\nlivelihoods will be less affected by adverse weather conditions.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Financial Analysis\n49. Prior to the conflict, Hera Port provided support and services to a reasonable-sized\nfishing fleet targeting the pelagic fishery. Since then the port has lapsed into a state of decline;\nno administration is present and the fishing fleet, or what is left of it, does not or cannot use the\nport.\n50. The Project will directly support the sector\u2019s strategic plan and act as a catalyst in\nproviding the fishing industry with much-needed confidence and facilities in harbor protection by\nrehabilitating breakwaters, providing access to ice production, improving loading and unloading\nfacilities  at  the  wharves,  providing  repair  and  maintenance  facilities  when  the  slipway  is\nrehabilitated, and improving access to trading and storage facilities.\n51. A full range of port activities is envisaged for the new operation, providing the harbor can\nbe rehabilitated to an operational standard. For example, tenders are now being received for the", "11\nleasing of a rehabilitated ice plant. In addition, revenue can be generated from 10 different\nsources: landed fish fees, berthage and mooring fees, cold storage facilities, water and fuel\nsales, lease rental of shops and workshops, accommodation, and export packaging facilities. All\nthese services will not be available immediately, but will be phased in over time. When full\noperation is achieved, the expected yearly revenue generated will be approximately $0.1 million.\n52. The future East Timorese Government could operate ports, airports, and harbors as\nstate assets, statutory authorities, or purely commercial enterprises. For the sake of a realistic\ncalculation, the Project envisages a port authority with a staffing of four. The annual cost of such\nan administration, in conjunction with support costs, is projected to be about $0.02 million. By\nthe end of 2002, the operation of the port should achieve a surplus over operating costs.\nHowever, the planned mooring of the two navy patrol vessels at the pier in Hera Port would\nlogically point to some kind of state authority for Hera Port in the near to medium future. Their\npresence are also likely to secure adequate operation and maintenance costs for the port.\na.  Least-Cost Analysis\n53. A least-cost analysis was carried out for the two project components: the breakwater\nreconstruction and the vertical wharf-face reconstruction.\n54. In  the  case  of  the  breakwater  reconstruction,  the  three  options  are  not  different\nengineering options, but rather different methods for applying the same engineering solution.\nThe engineering solution is simple, cost effective, and within budget. The existing breakwater\nsystem with materials in place requires rehabilitation of the core and a new armor system on the\nseaward sides. The source of this armor is either from a quarry or available rocks, although one\noption is to make concrete tetrapods.\n55. The options were tested at a discounted rate of 8 percent and 13 percent; on all tests the\nleast-cost option requires the involvement of a contractor with a very low profit margin to\nadminister and manage the Project with direct purchasing from a local quarry. The equalization\ndiscount rate was not calculated as the least-cost option prevailed at the two testing discount\nrates of 8 percent and 13 percent, with the 13 percent being above the threshold required by\nADB.\n56. For reconstruction of the vertical wharf face two options considered, applying the same\nmethodology as for the breakwaters. The option utilizing a contractor (e.g., an NGO) and local\nlabor prevailed.\nb.  Financial and Internal Rate of Return\n57. This size of investment with the revenues and costs generated, will produce a financial\ninternal rate of return of 6 percent. Although the initial investment is a grant and therefore does\nnot have to be repaid, the investment in this Project does not meet ADB\u2019s standard threshold of\nan opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent, but this standard may not be applicable in East\nTimor. The lack of information precluded the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital.\n58. However, for an infrastructure project such as this, the financial internal rate of return\nalone should not be the only consideration; it should be viewed in conjunction with the economic\nanalysis.", "12\n59. From a financial point of the view, with the initial investment being a grant, the operation\nand maintenance costs must be met from future activities. The expected annual revenues\nexceed expected annual costs by many times (paras. 53 and 54). This is a positive outcome of\nthe financial analysis.\n2.  Economic Analysis\n60. East Timor is primarily an agricultural economy, with 90 percent of the population living\nin rural areas and 75 percent of the labor force engaged in agriculture, primarily subsistence\nagriculture. The economic framework has changed dramatically, as East Timor can no longer\nrely on transfers from the Indonesian Government. External financing now plays a major role in\nthe economy, but this will be relatively short term, thus sustainable projects will form the\nbackbone of future development potential.\n61. The rehabilitation of the fishing harbor at Hera offers the country a variety of economic\nbenefits.  Care  has  been  taken  to  ensure  that  the  claimed  benefits  equate  only  to  the\nincremental effect of the harbor rehabilitation and that these benefits only bring the capacity of\nthe  fisheries  operations  back  to  preconflict  levels,  thus  ensuring  no  inflated  claims  for\nexaggerated increases in the fisheries sector.\n62. According to FMES the fish catches are expected to be easily sustainable at 15,000-\n20,000 tons per annum within the exclusive economic zone (yet to be negotiated), which would\nprovide the East Timorese with an annual per capita consumption level of 22 kg of fish protein.\nHowever, achieving these levels will require substantial and sustainable development within the\nsector, and will need more than the rehabilitation of Hera Port.\n63. FAO has recommended an annual level of 13 kg of fish protein per capita, as a balanced\nintake. East Timor is presently producing a catch of approximately 950 tons per annum, which\ngives a per capita consumption of 1.22 kg representing only 9 percent of the recommended fish\nprotein intake. Even if fishing levels are brought back up to preconflict levels of 2,800 tons\n(footnote  6),  this  will  only  result  in  a  per  capita  return  of  3.5  kg,  or  26  percent  of  the\nrecommended fish protein levels.\n64. These figures do not include the current subsistence fishing, and this will be ignored for\nthe economic analysis of the rehabilitation.13 The present catch is being achieved by small boats\nor bigger canoes, and is being brought to shore by just landing on the beach. The size boats\nusing the rehabilitated harbor at Hera are expected to be similar to those before the conflict,\n11 m craft, Japanese style, with a capacity of 5 gross tons.\n65. The economic analysis is based on a comparison of with- and without-project scenarios.\nThe cost and benefit streams were estimated for 30 years including only 8 months of project\nimplementation. Given that UNTAET has adopted the dollar as the official currency for the time\nbeing in East Timor, a shadow foreign exchange rate, or standard conversion factor has not\nbeen assumed for the analysis. The main benefits identified are: fish-handling methodologies,\nfish-catch recovery, fishing fleet protection, and socioeconomic impacts.\n                  \n13 The reason for ignoring the subsistence fishing is two-fold (i) it cannot be measured at this time and no records are\navailable to substantiate an educated guess, and (ii) the benefits are calculated within the confines of the\ncommercial catch available to Indonesia, up to the preconflict levels.", "13\n66. The present practice of landing fish on the beaches of Dili and on other beaches in the\nprovinces is proving to be both wasteful and dangerous. FMES estimates a catch loss of 50\npercent within 24 hours, and in an attempt to recover the losses, traders are producing dried fish\nfrom the residue resulting in bad products throughout the country. Access to ice would prolong\nthe shelf life of the catch by 18 days. Hera Port will offer this facility immediately following\nconstruction; the plant is already in place.\n67. The size of the present catch is 950 tons per annum. This is far below the preconflict\nperiod when it was up to 2,800 tons. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in the price of fish,\n(from about $0.8/kg to $5.3/kg), to a point where only the foreign emergency personnel in the\ncountry can afford it. FMES will use the rehabilitation of Hera Port as a catalyst to rejuvenate the\npelagic fishing fleet, and improve the catch levels such that prices will be reduced to levels that\nlocal people can afford.14\n68. The fishing fleet urgently needs repair. Only 4 or 5 boats are said to be operational out of\na fleet of 24. With the harbor offering safe anchorage and access to ice, and repair and\nmaintenance facilities, the fleet is expected to be rejuvenated at a rate of 5 boats per annum. In\npractice this may be quicker, but this is the assumption used for the economic analysis. Over\nthe longer run, the port will offer opportunities for the fishing fleet to keep operational through\nbetter operation and maintenance services.\n69. The incremental net economic cash flow over 30 years yields an economic internal rate\nof  return  of  87 percent.  This  result  is  consistent  with  that  of  other  ADB-funded  rural\ninfrastructure projects.\n70. The results of the economic analysis are summarized in Table 2, and full details are\npresented in Appendix 7.\nTable 2: Summary of EIRR and Sensitivity Tests\n (percent)\nCost Benefit Combined\nBase Increase Reduction Costs +10\nActivity Case +10 \u201320 Benefits \u201320\nOverall Project 87.0 82.4 82.0 77.7\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return\nSource:  Staff consultant estimates.\n3.  Distribution of Net Economic Benefits\n71. For the Project, the difference between financial and economic flows derives from two\nfactors: (i) some project inputs and outputs having conversion factors different from unity; and\n(ii) the Project generates economic benefits that are not captured as financial benefits. The net\nsteams of both financial and economic flows are discounted at the economic discount rate of 12\n                  \n14 This statement could be perceived as contradictory; to promote a fishery using larger and more expensive vessels\nand at the same time bring the price of fish down. The present inshore fishery targets the larger, slow-growing, and\nless abundant species. The pelagic fishery targets the abundant and fast-growing species, which are generally\ncaught in great numbers. A reasonable analogy would be the comparison of a longline fleet (app. $300,000 per\nvessel) targeting the highly priced (app. $10/kg) sashimi market with purse-seiners (app. $15 million per vessel)\ntargeting the skipjack tuna for canning (app. $0.6/kg).", "14\npercent. The analysis of the difference in economic and financial flows and their allocation is\npresented in Appendix 7.\n72. While the distribution analysis has not included economic benefit to the private sector,\nthe private sector will undoubtedly flourish in the fisheries sector. However, no assessment of\nthe impact on the private sector is included in the analysis because of the lack of data for such a\nfishery in East Timor.\n73. The recovery of the fishing industry is assumed to have a direct impact on the consumer.\nAt present, local consumers do not have access to fish, due to the artificially high market price\nbrought about by the overwhelming presence of the large international force and the scarcity of\nthe  fish.  Therefore  100  percent  of  the  economic  benefit  is  assumed  to  go  directly  to  the\nconsumer.\n74. Savings due to the restoration of storage facilities (none exist at the moment) are\nassumed to benefit all fishers equally, regardless of boat size.\n75. Fleet protection benefits are assumed to benefit mainly the larger and medium-sized\nboats, at percentages of 75 percent and 25 percent respectively, as the smaller canoes can be\nrepaired on the beaches using natural materials.\nB.  Environment\n76. The reestablishment of a functional fishing harbor will enable FMES to implement its\nstated objectives (footnote 6), which give high priority to protection of inshore resources in\ngeneral and reef ecosystems in particular. A functional Hera Port will give FMES the leverage to\npromote  an  offshore  fishery,  which  will  directly  contribute  to  reducing  fishing  pressure  on\ninshore resources. Another FMES objective is that communities, to a large extent, will be\nresponsible for managing the coastal and inshore resources; but any management regime\nneeds to be underpinned by proper legislation. Such legislation will be advanced with the\ndiversification into the offshore fishery.\nC.  Social Dimensions\n77. The overall Project objective is to contribute to sustained food security. From all the data\navailable, fish protein is in short supply; the preconflict level of fish catches probably only\ncovered a maximum of 50 percent of the FAO recommended yearly per capita consumption.\nThe influx of foreigners to East Timor for peacekeeping and the transitional administration has\ncreated a dramatic increase in the prices of fish. With the mandate for the peacekeepers to run\nuntil  2006  and  a  rather  large  contingency  of  aid  workers  who  will  continue  development\nprojects, the price of fish is likely to remain high in the near to medium term. However, another\nand equally important consideration must be taken into account when analyzing the present\nfish supply. Most foreigners prefer reef fish; given East Timor\u2019s very limited reef area a real\npossibility of overfishing exists. This would be to the long-term detriment of the traditional\nsubsistence fishers and the ecology.\n78. The Project will provide a functional base for larger pelagic fishing boats, which in turn,\nwill not only fish away from the vulnerable inshore and reef areas, but also target fish species\nthat are abundant, fast-growing, and generally much cheaper. The impact of increased supply\nof cheaper fish will have an immediate and positive impact on the poorer people of the society\nin form of better nutrition.", "15\n79. Such a shift in fisheries management could also lead to increased employment for\nwomen in the future. Smaller pelagic fish species are normally most suitable for drying and\nsalting, activities that traditionally are dominated by women. Another advantage in promoting a\nfishery of smaller pelagics is the fairer distribution of affordable protein to all members of a\nfamily, as everyone will get an equal share, and because smaller fish tend to be consumed\nwhole, the nutritional value is much greater than when eating larger fish.\nD.  Impact on Poverty\n80. The analysis to assess the poverty impact of this Project reflects the ADB Guidelines for\nthe Economic Analysis of Projects, and the Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact in the\nEconomic Analysis of Projects.\n81. According to the ADB discussion paper of March 2001 on the poverty assessment in\nEast Timor (footnote 9), 75 percent of the population is living below the poverty line. Certain\ndisclaimers to the results of that assessment are noted. However, the present price of fish at\napproximately $5.3 per kg undoubtedly means that the majority of the East Timorese cannot\ninclude fish in their diet. In the absence of any other reliable data, the FAO guideline for the\nminimum yearly food consumption of fish per capita is assumed to be applicable to the poverty\nline.\n82. To examine the poverty impact, the existing situation was considered along with the\nrelationship between production and the coverage of the kg per capita daily intake at the poverty\nline, based on the FAO guideline of 13 kg per capita per year for fish protein (or 0.036 kg per\ncapita per day). With a yearly production forecast for 2001 of 950 tons and a population of\n780,000, the intake of fish is only 0.003 kg per capita per day. This equals a consumption\ncoverage at the poverty line of 8 percent.\n83. Secondly, the ability of future production to meet demand at the absolute poverty line\nwithout project intervention was examined. The yearly production forecast for 2015 is 3,600 tons\nand the population forecast for that year is 1,019,103. This corresponds to 0.010 kg per capita\nper day, which equals consumption coverage at the poverty line of 28 percent. This clearly\nshows  that  without  intervention  the  fisheries  sector  cannot  achieve  the  production  levels\nrequired.\n84. Finally, in this analysis, the effects of this project intervention are shown to 2015. Yearly\nproduction forecast is set at 7,500 tons with population at 1,019,103. This corresponds to 0.020\nkg of fish per capita per day, which equals 56 percent consumption coverage.\n85. In the without-project scenario, the coverage of fish production to the per capita daily\nintake, at the poverty line, will increase from 8 percent to 28 percent. While the Project alone\ncannot achieve 100 percent coverage of the per capita production ratios at the poverty line, it\ncan assist in producing 56 percent of the per capita daily intake.\n86. Therefore the Project is highly desirable in terms of population-driven demand at the\npoverty base. However, other interventions are required; this Project alone does not meet or\ndeliver the quantity of fish protein required by the expanding population. This demand gap must\nbe closed; this Project can contribute to narrowing that gap.", "16\n87. The poverty impact ratio for this Project is 76 percent. This result was subjected to a\nsensitivity analysis with the following assumptions: (i) none of the benefit accruing to the larger\nboats reaches the poor, and (ii) as people become better fed by cheaper fish then national\npoverty incidence may go down in the later part of the Project, reducing the proportion of poor\nconsumers from 75 percent to 50 percent, The result in the event of both of these events\nhappening is a robust poverty impact ratio of 51 percent. From the distribution analysis, the\ngains and losses to the economy as a result of the Project need to be analyzed to determine the\nproportion that will affect the poor. Each of the net economic benefits/losses within the economy\nwill have an impact, the problem is to identify how much will reach the poor. The following\nassumptions have been made in the model. For the share in the overall economic benefit of the\nProject  (Government  share),  the  methodology  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating\nPoverty Impact in Economic Analysis of Projects was applied. Table 3 shows the results.\nTable 3: Estimation of Income Share of the Poor\nData Poverty line Annual Head Poverty Per Poor\u2019s\nYear Monthy Expenditures Count Gap Capita Share in\nExpenditures ($) Index Index GDP GDP\n($) (%)\nNational 2001 Using lower poverty line 3 36  0.356 0.079 304 3.9\n(Absolute Poverty)\nUsing upper poverty line 5 60 0.750 0.070 304 13.8\n(Hard Core Poverty)\nGDP = gross domestic product.\nSource = Staff consultant  estimates.\nE.  Risks\n88. One of the goals of FMES is to create a much smaller fisheries administration than\nunder Indonesian rule, namely from approximately 120 persons to around 20. The philosophy\nbehind the reduction is the realization that the private sector should lead the development, with\ngovernment providing an enabling business environment with the underpinning legislation and\nregulations. FMES\u2019s strategy further envisages that local communities will manage the inshore\nresources with a district fisheries officer as the FMES liaison.\n89. Even  with  unfavorable  changes  in  benefits  and  costs,  the  economic  returns  to  the\nProject are robust. The major risk to the Project not realizing its full potential is the nonadoption\nof  effective  legislation  and  an  inappropriate  institutional  framework  for  implementing  the\nfisheries strategic plan. UNTAET is working to rebuild East Timor\u2019s economy, but in reality it is\nnot the constitutionally elected government and therefore actions and programs may well be\nsubject to future challenge and repudiation by an elected government. However, the fisheries\nstrategic plan is based on traditional habits formed by fishers using Hera Port. Therefore, even\nin the absence of appropriate legislative and institutional arrangements, Hera Port rehabilitation\nwill likely be a natural catalyst for the recovery of the industry, beginning with the return of the\nfishers from Atauro Island. However, one risk factor is that local fishers cannot acquire larger\nfishing vessels. UNTAET has, in conjunction with FMES, commenced a boat-building project\nwith appropriate training facilities and programs. This project is expected to be expanded once\nthe harbor is again operational. The incentive to engage in the offshore fishing is the very high\ncurrent demand for fish.\n90. The pro-poor component of the Project relies on a sufficient fish catch to drive down the\ncurrent price. However, among the foreigners working in East Timor seafood is extremely", "17\npopular and commands very high prices. The preferred species are the larger bottom fish and\nreef fish. If the number of foreigners in East Timor remains high in the short to medium term and\nthe demand for seafood continues to be high, then FMES\u2019s strategy to diversify to the offshore\nfishery may be stalled. Fishers will naturally continue to satisfy a demand that gives high\neconomic returns, rather than invest in larger vessels and the associated bigger business risks.\n91. A review of other infrastructure and construction projects in and around Dili has revealed\na  substandard  implementation  quality.  Concrete  only  laid  six  months  ago  shows  signs  of\ncrumbling and is of suspect strength, breakwater constructions have been constructed with\n\u201carmor\u201d that is no bigger than \u201ccore\u201d materials. Unsupervised mixing and lack of local standards\nof  aggregate  and  sand  result  in  substandard  concrete,  according  to  local  and  foreign\ncontractors.  To  alleviate  this  problem,  procurement  packages  will  be  formulated  in  small\ndiscrete lots with high specifications. This will prevent small \u201cerrors\u201d in quality going unnoticed.\nFor example, the supply of \u201carmor\u201d from one source will be a different package to the supply of\n\u201ccore\u201d from another source.\n92. Another risk is that the strategic plan adopted may be derailed under a new government,\nwhich will be under pressure to provide jobs and economic growth. Precautionary fisheries\nmanagement is a long-term investment for a country to achieve a sustainable fishery and\nensure food security. However, short-term obligations in a country where the expectations of the\npopulation are very high and the pressure on government to deliver is correspondingly high,\nmay be factors that will sacrifice good long-term intentions for short-term obligations.\nVI.

Introduction\n1. The Project\u2019s environmental impact is classified as category B. An initial environmental\nexamination of the Project was carried out in accordance with the Environmental Assessment\nRequirements1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nB.  Description of the Environment\n2. East Timor is part of Timor Island, one of the Lesser Sunda chain of islands. The capital,\nDili, is situated at the mouth of the River Comoro on a low plain at the head of a bay between\nMotael and Fatu Cama a point that rises to a mountain 490 m high. Hera Port is located in Hera\nabout 15 km east of Dili along a paved coastal road leading to Baucau.\n3. Hera Port is exposed to the northwest (NW) monsoons, which normally blow between\nNovember and March. Between April and September the wind blows from the southeast (SE).\nThe NW monsoon averages force 2 to 4 on the Beaufort scale, whereas the strength of the SE\nmonsoon varies between force 3 to 5.2 The winds near the coast are affected by local variations\nof wind direction and speed caused by topography and the orientation of the coastline. The SE\nmonsoon winds often create a NE wind condition when the SE wind temporarily becomes an\neasterly wind.\n4. In Timor a typical monsoon climate prevails with well-marked wet and dry seasons\ncorresponding to the NW and SE monsoons. Consequently, rivers run as strong torrents during\nthe wet season and are dry during the dry season. During the wet season, strong discoloration\nof the inshore areas of the coastline occurs as a result of silt-laden run-off.\n5. The highest astronomical tide or maximum tidal range goes up to 2.50 meters above the\nlowest astronomical tide or admiralty chart datum. Mean high water springs are 1.80 meters\nabove chart datum, whereas mean low water springs are 0.50 meters above chart datum. At\nspring tides and during peak tidal flow, strong currents of at least 4 knots run along parts of the\ncoast. These currents are clearly visible from headlands during peak tidal flows.\n6. Wave  disturbance  and  swell  are  slight  to  moderate  for  most  of  the  year.  Wave\nconditions, however, are normally aggravated when a well-established SE monsoon backing to\nE blows directly into the inner basin. The breakwaters, as presently constructed, offer no\nprotection in such conditions.\n7. Access to Hera Port from Dili is via a paved road. Overall, the road is in good repair\nexcept for a couple of untarred interruptions, which are expected to be repaired soon. Travel\ntime from Dili is approximately 20 minutes.\n1.  Existing Land Use and Ownership\n8. The entire port complex is government property, which currently is in the hands of the\nDili District of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).\n                  \n1  Office of Environment and Social Development. 1998.  Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian\nDevelopment Bank. Manila: Asian Development Bank.\n2  Force 2 is a \u201clight breeze\u201d of approximately 6-11 kilometers per hour, force 5 is a \u201cfresh breeze\u201d of approximately\n30-38 kilometers per hour.", "28\nAppendix 5, page 2\n9. With the consent of the UNTAET Transitional Administrator, the existing lease of half the\nport area has been extended until December 2002 to a private company entrusted with the\nrepatriation of the Australian army\u2019s equipment back to Australia. Under the terms of the lease\nagreement, payment is in the form of compensatory infrastructure services. These services\nhave so far materialized in a fully functioning ice factory, a new water tank, repairs to roofs of\nvarious buildings, pavement of the port service area, and erection of barracks for future use as\nservice shops.\n10. Overall,  the  facility  at  Hera  was  not  heavily  damaged  during  the  September  1999\nupheaval and is in relatively good shape, although a lot of maintenance work is needed. Most of\nthe port\u2019s shortcomings are the result of design flaws and poor supervision during construction.\nThe port has had little or no maintenance since it was built.\n2.  Existing Infrastructure\n11. Map 2, Hera Port Layout (p. ix) shows the layout consisting of a load-out jetty with a draft\nof 0.5 m above chart datum, a small vessel basin with an average draft of around 0.3 m, and an\nice plant and various buildings. The load-out jetty has a length of 80 m and a cross frontage of\n30 m. Average depth along the jetty is 5.0 m.\n12. The boat basin itself is still intact although settlement due to the leaching out of fines\nfrom behind the retaining structure is taking its toll on the finish and general appearance. The\nstructure appears to consist of a concrete beam sitting on the seabed and backed by a rubble\nslope. The slope has been faced with concrete to provide a relatively smooth surface.\n13. The ice plant was rehabilitated recently and is now in working order. It is a block-ice\nfacility using ammonia as coolant. The maximum capacity is 22 tons per day. Two tenderers\nhave bid for this facility and award of contract is expected within a couple of months.\n14. The port\u2019s former water supply consisted of two small overhead tanks\u2014but with no\nstorage facilities\u2014and appears to be in good condition. The firm in charge of the Australian\narmy equipment has installed a 150,000 liter water storage reservoir next to the borewell. The\nport buildings appear to have borne the brunt of the wave of destruction that enveloped Dili after\nthe independence referendum. All buildings show signs of damage or looting.\nC.  Screening Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n15. As this Project aims to restore an existing port facility to operational use, no particular\nenvironmental issues are anticipated as no new structures will be added to the existing ones,\nand the rehabilitation of the breakwaters will not alter their positions or lengths, and therefore,\nnot alter any currents of flows of water.\n16. The increasing problems associated with the construction of new fishing facilities or the\nupgrading of existing ones, and in particular their operation and maintenance, have reached\ncritical levels in many parts of the world. In many cases, the adverse effects of harbor pollution\nfrom the activities of fishing vessels, as well as those of vendors and processors, are normally\nassociated with the lack of waste reception and hygiene facilities.\n17. Several directives give technical guidelines for developing and managing harbors and\nlanding  places  for  fishing  vessels.  Among  the  most  appropriate  are  (i)  United  Nations", "29\nAppendix 5, page 3\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, December 1982 (UNCLOS 82); (ii) International Convention\nfor the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL\n73/78); and (iii) United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, June 1992\n(UNCED 92). The goals as set out in Fish for the Future: - A Strategic Plan for the Fisheries in\nEast  Timor  should  ensure  that  any  future  East  Timorese  government  will  enforce\nimplementation of the necessary measures to comply with the various resolutions related to\nprivatizing port facilities.\n18. The expected increased use of the port may lead to increased pollution levels. Pollution\nof the aquatic environment from vessel operations typically falls into two broad categories, i.e.,\nfrom the repair of the vessels and from the vessels themselves. The rehabilitated port will have\na repair workshop, and eventually, the existing slipway will also be refurbished. The sources of\npollution would consist of oily bilge water; spent engine oil; hazardous solid wastes such as\nbatteries and engine components, and nontoxic solid waste such as nets, fenders, and other\nfittings. However, the chance of containing and restricting these types of pollution are much\ngreater within a controlled environment as a port with a proper port administration than where\nno functional port exists and the pollution would take place wherever the fishing vessels moor\nalong the coast.\n19. During the rehabilitation/construction phase, unavoidable but temporary environmental\nimpacts will include increased noise-levels, dust, and traffic. The Implementing Agency will be\ntasked to ensure that these inconveniences are kept at minimal levels and ensure that during\nspecial holidays, religious services, or other cultural events that the activities do not disturb\nthese events.\nD.  Findings and Recommendations\n20. The Project will not cause any adverse environmental impact in the project area except\nincreased noise, dust, and traffic during the construction phase. Completion of the Project is\nexpected  to  have  a  positive  benefit  for  the  environment  by  restricting  and  containing\nuncontrolled discharge of pollutants from the fishing vessels within the port area, as opposed to\nuncontrolled discharges along the coast.\n21. An environmental impact assessment is not warranted. However, if any new facilities\nneed to be developed within the port area, the Fisheries and Marine Environment Service will be\nrequired to implement an initial environmental examination for each such development.", "30\nAppendix 6, page 1\nINITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\nA.  Introduction\n1. An initial social assessment of the Project was carried out as part of the Fact-Finding\nand Appraisal missions. This report was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the\nIncorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations.\nB.  Benefits and Beneficiaries\n2. The upheaval in connection with the Indonesian withdrawal in September 1999 caused a\ndisplacement of more than 50 percent of the East Timorese population, which was estimated to\nbe around 900,000. By the end of 1999 more that 85 percent had returned to their homes, but\napproximately 80,000-100,000 people are still displaced in Indonesian-ruled West Timor. The\nlikelihood of these people returning is uncertain. About 80-90 percent of the population live in\nrural areas, with the remainder living in the capital Dili and in 12 main towns. Even before the\n1999 upheaval and displacement, East Timor was one of the poorest areas in Southeast Asia,\nwith only 64 percent of adult literacy, 55-58 years of life expectancy, and a moderately high\ninfant mortality at 85 deaths per 1,000 live births.\n3. The incidence of poverty declined from 37 percent in 1993 to around 25 percent in 1997,\nonly to fall back to the 1993 level during the Asian financial crisis. As a result of the political,\neconomic, and social upheaval from August 1999 to September 2000, the incidence of poverty\nhas reached an all time high of 75 percent.1\n4. Because of poor soil fertility and low annual rainfall in East Timor, production of stable\nfoods  is insufficient; the majority of East Timorese report that they do not have enough to eat\nduring November, December, and January (end of the dry season/beginning of the wet season).\nLittle  data  for  fisheries  production  or  fisheries  consumption  is  available.  Only  anecdotal\nevidence indicates that fish actually are a major part of the nutritional intake during these critical\nmonths. In a special lunar period, in either October or November, one pelagic fish species\ncomes to the shores on the north coast to spawn during spring-tide. Thousands upon thousands\nof people from the mountains reportedly congregate on the coast and use traps to catch these\nfish once they have spawned. During this short period\u2014around one week\u2014all fish are gutted,\nsplit, and dried, to be brought back to the hinterlands for consumption during the lean months.\nAlthough no figures are available of these catches, the sheer number of people coming from\nfaraway indicate that the harvest must be considerable.\n5. In general, women\u2019s status under traditional Timorese systems has been very restricted,\nwith men being the decision makers and taking the leadership roles in the villages. Slowly these\nroles  are  changing  due  to  the  social  disruption  in  the  country\u2019s  long-term  struggle  for\nindependence. However, within fisheries, women have always played an important role in the\nprocessing, and to a certain extent in the trade of fish.\nC.  Needs and Demands\n6. Although an accurate count of the total amount of fish caught in East Timor is not\navailable, data does suggest a severe shortfall of fish protein available to the population. To\n                  \n1  Asian Development Bank in collaboration with the East Timor Transitional Administration. 2000. Initial Poverty\nAssessment East Timor. Manila.", "31\nAppendix 6, page 2\nreach the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) minimum recommended yearly per capita\nintake of 13 kilograms, total fish landings should be around 8,500 tons per year. The data from\nthe  Indonesian  fisheries  statistics  in  1997,  record  only  a  little  more  that  2,000  tons.  If\nsubsistence and occasional special harvests are factored in, the annual catches are likely to be\naround 4,000 tons. However, this represents a shortfall of fish of about 50 percent.\n7. The large number of international staff of the United Nations Transitional Administration\nhave caused prices of fish in the major cities to soar, thus creating a temporarily lucrative\nmarket but to the detriment of ordinary people who have limited income. They have also created\na demand for fish species that are susceptible to depletion because of limited habitats in East\nTimor.\n8. The Project\u2019s overall objective, to contribute to increased food security by promoting\nfishing  effort  to  more  abundant  pelagic  fish  species,  should  therefore  result  in  more  fish\nreaching  the  markets  and  subsequently  drive  the  prices  down.  Such  a  development  will\nprimarily benefit the poor.\nD.  Adverse Effects on Vulnerable Groups\n9. The Project will not involve any land acquisition or resettlement. The project site will only\ninvolve rehabilitation of already existing infrastructure; the site is located within the greater port\narea, which is administered by the District of Dili. Access to the port area is by public road. The\nProject will not have any negative impacts on any vulnerable groups.\nE.  Social Dimension in Project Design\n1.  Community Participation\n10. The  port  concept  was  designed  during  1983  under  Loan  693-INO:  Fisheries\nInfrastructure Project. When the port was finished in 1993, use was restricted to the immigrant\npopulation from Indonesia, notably the commercial fishers from Sulawesi. There are no records\nof any East Timorese person owning and operating any of the commercial vessels operating\nfrom  Hera  Port.  However,  the  fishers  from  Atauro  island  immediately  north  of  Dili,  are\nrecognized for their fishing skills and often landed their catches for the Dili market at Hera Port.\n11. A minimum of 18 larger fishing vessels is reportedly based at Atauro, but only a handful\nare apparently in working order. The Fisheries and Marine Environmental Service (FMES) took\nthe decision to rehabilitate Hera Port as part of a public commitment to provide an enabling\nenvironment for private sector-lead pelagic fisheries activity. By making such infrastructure\navailable, a proper management framework can be put in place, thereby ensuring sustainability\nof such a fishery.\n12. Hera Port is located only 14 kilometers east of Dili; the three villages in the vicinity of the\nport have massive unemployment. To assist, albeit temporarily, these communities with an\nopportunity to obtain work and thus needed cash during the port rehabilitation, the Project is\ndesigned to be as labor intensive as possible. Some work will have to be carried out by heavy\nmachines, e.g., placing armor rocks on the breakwaters, but wherever possible employment\nconsiderations  will  be  given  precedence  over  time  considerations.

FMES\u2019s priority to let the commercially oriented private sector take the lead in fisheries\ndevelopment should guarantee operational success for Hera Port. Such a policy will give the\nlocal people business opportunities and subsequent jobs that are so badly needed in East\nTimor. The port area has an ice factory, a slipway, a boatyard, a workshop, a fuel-storage\nfacility, and service areas with barracks for lease. What is not already privatized of these assets\nwill be in the future.\n3.  Cost Recovery\n14. In a public investment like a port, operation and maintenance costs must be recovered.\nThe following charges are expected to more than adequately cover the cost: a certain percent of\nthe value of the fish landed, berthage and mooring fees, as well as a lease fee on all rented\npremises by the private sector. In the fisheries sector the vessel operators or owners must\nclearly see the benefit of such a user pay system. Lessons learned indicate that a licensing\nsystem with a limited number of licenses to be issued is one formula that seems to work. This\nnot only gives a sense of ownership and responsibility of the resources in question, but also\nensures the ability of the vessel operators to pay the required fees.", "33 Appendix 7, page 1\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\nA. Introduction\n1. East Timor has a coastline of more than 600 kilometers (km), on which is situated\napproximately 100 communities that have been using a wide range of fish and other marine\nproducts on a sustainable basis for generations. The fisheries sector of East Timor has the\npotential to contribute significantly to production of high quality protein at affordable prices for\nlocal consumption and as a foreign exchange income from exports.\n2. The many skilled fishers are predominantly landless or land poor people with a low\nstandard of living. The women do not participate in fishing in open waters but are involved in\nshore-based  activities  as  fish  traders,  traditional  fish  processing,  and  net  making/repairing\nactivities.\n3. Three occupational categories of fishers were identified in the project area:\n(i)  Professional fishers earn their livelihood entirely from fishing. The island of\nAtauro has a long history of fishing as a primary occupation; at least 100 of the\n400 fishers have experienced deep sea fishing in the Pacific Ocean, Indian\nOcean, and in the waters around Indonesia. They were the main users of Hera\nPort.\n(ii)  Part-time  fishers  fish  for  only  part  of  the  year  to  supplement  their  food\nconsumption and possibly income, and are engaged in other employment on the\nland during the rest of the year.\n(iii)  Occasional  fishers  fish  irregularly  and  mainly  for  subsistence  rather  than\nincome.\n4. East Timor\u2019s coastline should be capable of supporting a substantial fishing industry, but\nthe development of the fisheries sector has been severely stunted by the events leading to the\nwithdrawal of Indonesia. Much of the infrastructure was either destroyed (vessels and fishing\ngear) or disabled (ports), and normal life completely disrupted (loss of all scientific data and\ndeparture of key personnel).1\n5. Staff  of  the  Fisheries  and  Marine  Environment  Service  (FMES),  in  the  Division  of\nAgricultural Affairs, has devised a strategic plan2 for the fisheries of East Timor. One of its major\nobjectives  is  to  establish  a  profitable  private  sector-based  fishing  industry  that  maximizes\nsustainable economic returns to East Timor.\n6. The proposed project intervention is rehabilitation of the fisheries facilities at Hera Port,\nlocated approximately 16 km east of the capital city of Dili. In 1990 the Indonesian Government,\nwith the assistance of a sector loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), built a series of\nharbors throughout Indonesia of which Hera Port was one.\n                  \n1  Food and Agriculture Organization. 2000.

Fishers generally own the gear and boat either individually or as a group; labor wages\nare paid on a catch-sharing basis. The distribution of catch, however, varies depending on the\nnature of the fishing effort.\n9. The existing fleet consists of 18 \u201cbonito\u201d class boats, of the 24 originally built in Hera\nmostly in 1998; these are based on Atauro Island. These are 11 meter (m) craft of Japanese\nstyle and are described as 5 gross tons, with operational speeds of less than 5 knots. About 4 or\n5 are still operational. In addition, a second class of vessels are named \u201clorosae\u201d. These are 10\ngross tons and are 14 m in total length.\n10. Dili lacks facilities for boat repair and maintenance, spare parts, and appropriate skills;\nthis means that breakdowns are likely to increase.\n11. This report considers the economic feasibility and financial impact of the Hera Port\nFisheries Facilities Rehabilitation Project, with particular emphasis on economic and financial\nappraisal methodologies as employed by ADB.\n12. The  Project  will  directly  support  the  sector  strategic  plan  and  act  as  a  catalyst  in\nproviding the fishing industry with much-needed confidence and facilities in protection at berth\nthrough reconstruction of breakwaters, access to the production of ice through better access to\nthe  ice  plant,  better  loading  and  unloading  facilities  at  the  wharves,  and  repairs  and\nmaintenance facilities when the rehabilitation of the slipway is complete.\n13. The Project\u2019s purpose is to achieve responsible fisheries management by promoting the\noffshore pelagic fisheries and thus, reduce fishing presure on inshore resources.  Rehabilitation\nof the fisheries facilities in the harbor basin will act as a catalyst to fulfill this purpose.\n14. To complete the analysis, the financial and economic analysis was applied to two distinct\ncomponents falling under the objectives:\n(i)  breakwater reconstruction, and\n(ii)  vertical- face wall wharf reconstruction.\nB.  Fisheries Sector Overview\n15. Due to the dramatic upheavals in East Timor as a consequence of the Indonesian\nwithdrawal the situation must be reviewed before and after the event to establish a baseline of\nthe current situation (Table A7.2).", "35 Appendix 7, page 3\nTable A7.2: Assessment of Fisheries Sector\nSituation before September 1999\n\u2022  The industry consisted of 10,000 full-time and 10,000 part-time fishers.\n\u2022  Approximately 3,500 fishing canoes and about 250 larger vessels were operational.\n\u2022  Indonesians from outside had control of all the larger vessels.\n\u2022  East Timorese were prevented from obtaining large boats because the Indonesians\nfeared they would escape to Australia.\n\u2022  Only 2,600 tons of fish were recorded in 1997/98.\n\u2022  Data was only collected at a few landing sites (the landed catch is estimated to have\nbeen much larger).\n\u2022  Large ice vessels operating out of other Indonesian ports regularly fished close to shore.\n\u2022  About 160 fisheries staff serviced the coastal fisheries, out to 3 nautical miles, and six\nsmall carp hatcheries that supplied fingerlings to farmers.\n\u2022  Nearly all the senior fisheries officers were Javanese.\n\u2022  Numerous attempts at prawn farming failed.\n\u2022  Approximately 100 young trained East Timorese were serving on international fishing\nfleets in the Indian and Pacific oceans and in Indonesian territorial waters.\n\u2022  Although the data show that fishing in East Timor accounted for only 1 percent of the\ngross domestic product of East Timor, it was probably a lot higher.\nSeptember 1999\n\u2022  All of the larger boats, except for 20 fiberglass 11 meter vessels, left East Timor.\n\u2022  90 percent of the canoe fleet was destroyed.\n\u2022  75 percent of the gear and engines were destroyed or stolen.\n\u2022  Cooperatives and cold storages were all destroyed.\n\u2022  Most marketing networks collapsed.\n\u2022  A large majority of the commercial fishers were Indonesians and they left East Timor .\nToday\u2019s Situation\n\u2022  National fisheries staff number 20 (full complement).\n\u2022  1 United Nations senior adviser and 4 United Nations volunteers work in the sector.\n\u2022  Funding is sourced for 15 national staff to study in Australia, Iceland, New Caledonia,\nPortugal, and Thailand.\n\u2022  Five staff are presently studying overseas.\n\u2022  $50,000 was spent on Phase I of a fisheries project between Chile and East Timor.\n\u2022  11 small-scale fisheries projects covering boat building, engine maintenance, fishing\ntechnology, harvesting, salt and dried fish production, gear donations, and salt production\nare nearing completion.\n\u2022  The Pilot Fish Attraction Device (FAD) project started.\n\u2022  Iceland is giving support in principle to fund full-scale FAD project ($100,000).\n\u2022  The ninth container load of fishing gear arrived from Australia.\n\u2022  The People\u2019s Republic of China has supplied 72 containers of gear, including nets, fish\ntanks, and outboard engines.\n\u2022  Fisheries was added to the high priority list for the donor funding at meeting in Brussels.\n\u2022  The country\u2019s two major carp hatcheries are being repaired.\nSource:  Information provided by the Fisheries and Marine Environment Service, extract from a presentation by Mr.\nRichard Mounsey UN Senior Advisor, in Cairns, Australia, July 2001.", "36 Appendix 7, page 4\nB.  Methodology for the Economic and Financial Analyses\n16. The  Hera  Port  Development  took  place  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nassistance  in  1990  through  a  fisheries  infrastructure  loan  (ADB  Loan  693-INO)  to  the\nGovernment of Indonesia. This loan was used for the construction of 25 fish-landing areas,\nincluding Hera Port. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) commissioned a report in\nAugust 2000 on Fishing Port Infrastructure Rehabilitation, which included a review on the\ndamage and disrepair to the Hera Port. The study did not include an economic analysis and the\nanalysis done for the infrastructure loan in 1990 is not available. According to the ADB project\nperformance audit report completed on 31 December 1997, the analysis would not be of much\nrelevance to this rehabilitation project due to its emphasis on increasing fishing volume as\nopposed to the benefits obtained from fish-handling and trading costs and reduction of other\noperational costs. This report will examine economic feasibility and financial impact of the Hera\nPort Fisheries Facilities Rehabilitation Project and will comply with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the\nEconomic Analysis of Projects (February 1997).\n17. The scope of the economic analysis seeks to address several issues and impacts of the\nProject including\n(i)  forecasting demand for the Project;\n(ii)  conducting least-cost analysis of alternative options;\n(iii)  calculating  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  subprojects,  and\nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) where revenue streams exist;\n(iv)  determining whether economic benefits exceed economic costs;\n(v)  assessing whether net economic benefits are sustainable throughout the life of\nthe Project;\n(vi)  identifying the risks to the success of the Project; and\n(vii)  identifying the impact on poverty reduction by calculating the poverty impact ratio\n(PIR).\n18. The financial analysis will estimate the profit accruing to the project operating entity or to\nthe project participants, whereas the economic analysis will measure the effect of the Project on\nthe  national  economy.  For  the  Project  to  be  economically  viable,  it  must  be  financially\nsustainable,  as  well  as  economically  efficient.  In  theory  if  the  Project  is  not  financially\nsustainable then economic benefits will not be realized. However, in this particular case, the\nProject will act as the catalyst for reestablishing the fishing industry, which at present has been\ndestroyed, therefore an overwhelming economic benefit is expected to outweigh the financial\nbenefits of the port rehabilitation. Nevertheless a financial analysis is included to assess the\nsustainability of the port and focuses on\n(i)  assessing the degree to which the Project will generate revenues sufficient to\nmeet its financial obligations, including the cost of port management;\n(ii)  assessing the incentives for fishers, processors, and traders;\n(iii)  ensuring that the demand or output forecasts on which the economic analysis is\nbased are consistent with financial charges or available budget resources; and\n(iv)  developing  tariff,  charges,  and/or  tax  structures  based  on  affordability  and\nwillingness to pay.\n19. The economic analysis will attempt to assess the overall impact of the Project on the\neconomic welfare of all the members of society in East Timor and will measure the Project\u2019s", "37 Appendix 7, page 5\npositive and negative impacts in terms of willingness to pay for units of increased consumption,\nand to accept compensation of forgone units of consumption.\n20. The least-cost analysis is carried out in economic (border) prices, and used to determine\nwhich  development  option  is  preferred  economically  where  a  number  of  viable  technical\nalternatives exist. The principal economic decision criteria employed is the net present value of\nthe sum of the discounted net cash-flow stream of the Project. It is the cumulative present worth\nof  the  incremental  national  income  generated  by  the  investment.  For  the  Project  to  be\neconomically feasible, the net present value must be positive for a predetermined discount rate,\nwhich reflects the opportunity cost of capital in East Timor.\n21. This requires the estimation of cost streams over the entire economic life of the Project\nfor each of the feasible components. For the project options that deliver the same benefits, the\nequalizing discount rate between each is estimated and compared. The equalizing discount rate\n(or the crossover discount rate) is the discount rate at which the preference changes. It is also\nthe rate at which the present values of the cost streams are equal.\n22. The EIRR is the discount rate that when applied to the stream of incremental benefits\nand costs as reflected in the net cash flow of the project produces a zero net present value. It is\nthe maximum (real, noninflationary) annual rate of interest that the project could pay for the\nresources used if the project is to recover all of its costs and still break even. For the project to\nbe economically feasible, the EIRR must be equal to or greater than the opportunity cost of\ncapital in East Timor.\n23. The calculation of the EIRR of the port facilities and fisheries components of the Project\nis based on the economic benefits expressed in terms of consumer\u2019s willingness to pay and\nresource cost savings. These benefits often represent a very conservative estimate of the\nbenefits resulting from the project, given the health (access to protein), and substitution for\nagricultural food production benefits expected to arise from more efficient fish handling and\ntrading facilities.\n24. The  Project  will  provide  considerable  socioeconomic  benefits.  Jobs  will  be  created\nduring construction and then on an ongoing basis by the creation of a fishing industry. In\naddition, the concept of social dimensions captures the key elements of human perspective,\nincluding  poverty  reduction;  enhancement  of  the  role  of  women  in  development;  human\nresource development including population planning; and avoidance or mitigation of adverse\nimpacts of development interventions on vulnerable groups that do not have the capacity to\nabsorb such effects. The mission did not quantify the socioeconomic benefits due to practical\ninformation constraints.\n25. Due to the urgency of project preparation and lack of reliable data, the study did not\ndescribe the current utilization of resources in affected areas for commercial and/or subsistence\nincome (e.g., intensity of fishing, dynamite fishing, fishing with small mesh nets, mangrove\nand/or nipa-palm harvesting, coral reef harvesting, seaweed farming, and siltation and pollution\ndue to unsound practices).\n26. In addition, data constraints precluded an examination of the amount of income from the\nenterprise,  the  reliability  of  the  income,  and  the  sustainability  of  the  production  system.\nEconomic  assumptions  were  used  to  determine  the  rate  of  degradation  of  coastal/marine\nresources, and to assess whether the resource base can sustain existing levels.", "38 Appendix 7, page 6\n27. Where  revenue  streams  are  identifiable,  the  FIRR  was  calculated.  Engineers  cost\nestimates are used to identify tariff, charge, and/or tax levels necessary to achieve full cost\nrecovery and to meet operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Affordable tariff structures were\nthen developed based on household incomes and consumer\u2019s ability and willingness to pay.\n28. Major project risks were identified and assessed. However, due to time constraints, the\nsensitivity analysis was restricted to just 3 main variations:\n(i)  increase in total project costs by 10 percent,\n(ii)  a reduction in project benefits of 10 percent, and\n(iii)  a combination of both of these events.\nC. Assumptions on Project Costs\n29. The  costs  were  prepared  according  to  standard  ADB  guidelines  using  COSTAB\nsoftware. The costs were based either on local prices prevailing in the project area in mid-July\n2001 or in dollar terms inflated from previous studies at a rate of 2.4 percent per year.\n30. Economic analysis was carried out using economic costs with financial costs adjusted to\nallow for transfer payments including taxes, duties, or subsidies, and to correct for any market\ndistortions. For the present study, the following general assumptions have been adopted:\n(i)  All revenues, benefits, and costs are expressed in mid-2001 prices.\n(ii)  The  implementation  period  for  the  Project  is  eight  months  covering  all  the\nidentified interventions proposed with funds drawn down in line with the project\ndisbursement  schedule  and  charges  introduced  to  full  levels  during  the\nimplementation period.\n(iii)  Each subproject component is assumed to have a useful economic life of 32\nyears after construction for buildings, 20 years for civil works, and 10 years for\nmechanical components.\n(iv)  The real opportunity cost of capital employed in the analysis is assumed to be 12\npercent per annum, and represents the social opportunity cost of capital for East\nTimor.\n(v)  For the distribution analysis, a shadow wage rate factor (SWF) of labor (the ratio\nof true opportunity cost to the financial wage rate paid by the Project) is assumed\nto be necessary to apply to the labor column. In the absence of any firm data and\nsome anecdotal evidence about huge employment queues for United Nation\nconstruction  projects  a  conservative  SWF  of  0.5  (implying  50  percent\nunemployment) is assumed.\n31. The following assumptions have been made with regard to costs:\n(i)  All economic costs, in particular imported tradable inputs, are net of duties and\ntaxes (an average level of duties and taxes of 20 percent on imported items is\nassumed for plant and machinery).\n(ii)  Capital  costs,  in  the  calculation  of  FIRR  and  EIRR,  include  physical\ncontingencies but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction.\n(iii)  The average 2001 official exchange rate of the Indonesian rupiah was used to\nconvert  local  currency  to  their  foreign  exchange  costs  equivalent;  Australian\ndollars are treated the same way. The reason for this is that in East Timor a\nnumber of currencies are being used in this post conflict situation, however this is", "39 Appendix 7, page 7\nnow being stabilized by the current administration which is deepening the use of\nthe dollar in the economy.3\n(iv)  Given that the United Nations Transitional Administration for East Timor have\nadopted the dollar as the official currency for the time being in East Timor a\nshadow  foreign  exchange  rate,  or  standard  conversion  factor  has  not  been\nassumed for the analysis.\n32. O&M costs are based on the specific operating characteristics of each subproject, but as\na general guideline are assumed to be reinforcing equipment at 5 percent per annum, civil\nworks at 1.5 percent, motor vehicles at 25 percent, and hand-tools at 10 percent per annum.\nD. Expected Impact of the Main Components\n1. Breakwater Reconstruction\n33. The existing facility has suffered damage mainly due to its exposure to wave action,\nwhich has caused leaching of fine material from the wharf structure. This leaching, coupled with\nwave action, has caused partial collapse of parts of the structure.\n34. The breakwaters were constructed from core type material without armor. Additionally\nthey were constructed with a crest level lower than highest astronomical tide. Consequently\nduring storms or periods of reasonable swell, which coincided with high spring tides, the wave\naction was simply transferred from offshore to within the harbor basin itself. This wave action\nwithin the harbor basin would not have had the capacity to be dampened, hence the ongoing\ndeterioration of the wharf structure.\n35. In addition to protection for the main wharf structure and harbor the breakwaters will\nprovide safer shelter to fishing boats in all types of weather. Thus the main economic impact of\nthis component is assessed to be in the resource cost savings of the total destruction of boats\nand the ongoing O&M of the fishing fleet.\n2. Vertical Face Wharf Rehabilitation\n36. The absence of a functional fishing port in East Timor makes it very difficult\u2014if not\nimpossible\u2014for the fisheries department to implement responsible fisheries management by\ndiverting the fishing pressure to the more abundant and sustainable pelagic resources. The\nvessels for such an offshore-based fishery are larger and need a protective shelter as base as\nthe  vessels  are  too  large  to  beach.  Hera  Port  was  built  under  a  previous  ADB  loan4  to\nIndonesia, and although this port was only finished in 1992, the poor construction has caused\nthe breakdown of most of the structures and no fishing vessels operate from there.\n37. The rehabilitation at Hera will provide improved mooring and unloading facilities, and ice\navailability; and act as a center for the receipt, processing and distribution of fish for Dili and\nbeyond. Facilities will also be available to provide training, including repair and maintenance of\nmarine engines and other fishing equipment, and fish processing and storage. Once the harbor\nbasin is rehabilitated Atauro fishers are expected to be the first to relocate to Hera. The\n                  \n3  Staff statement by Luis Valdivieso, Advisor, Asia and Pacific Department of the International Monetary Fund at the\ndonors\u2019 meeting for East Timor, June 14-15, 2001.\n4  Loan 693-INO: Fisheries Infrastructure Sector Project, for $50 million, approved on 28 July 1983.", "40 Appendix 7, page 8\ndevelopment of a pelagic fishing fleet will, however, take several years as investment and\ntraining will require time.\n38. The Project is relatively modest in scope comprising rehabilitating and strengthening\nthree individual breakwaters of a total length of 140 m, and the rehabilitation of the wharf faces\nof the port basin totalling approximately 400 m. The work will include replenishment of washed-\naway core material from the breakwaters and enforcement of the seaward side with a stone\narmor. This will achieve the required height of the breakwaters to protect the port basin against\nwave action at all tides. Precast concrete slabs anchored in profiled steel piles will enforce the\nwharf faces inside the port basin. This will create a secured mooring site for easy on- and\noffloading of all vessels. The working apron alongside the wharves will also be upgraded and/or\nrehabilitated.\n39. The economic impact is far reaching. The present low level of the fishing industry makes\nit such that any incremental adjustment to the sector will result in substantial benefits. The\nbenefits measured for this analysis are only minimal and due to time constraints and lack of\nbase data are restricted to the following: fish catch recovery to preconflict levels; mitigation of\ncurrent wastages due to lack of fish processing and storage facilities, and tools (such as ice);\nfishing fleet protection; protection of the inshore fishing stock and reefs; and socioeconomic\nimpacts.\nE.  Financial Analysis\n1.  Least-Cost Analysis of Alternative Options\n40. In the case of the breakwater reconstruction, the options are not different engineering\noptions but rather different methods for apply the same engineering solution. The engineering\nsolution is simple and cost effective within the budgeted amount. An existing breakwater system\nwith materials in place requires rehabilitation of the core and a new armor system on the\nseaward sides. The source of this armor is from a quarry, although one option was to have\nconcrete tetrapods made.\n41. The options were tested at 8 percent and 13 percent and on all tests the least-cost\noption was hiring a nongovernment organization to administer and manage the Project with\ndirect purchasing from a local village that controls a quarry. The equalization discount rate was\nnot calculated as the least cost option prevailed at the two testing discount rates of 8 percent\nand 13 percent, with the 13 percent being above the threshold required by ADB (Table A7.7).\n2.  Cost Estimates\n42. Supplementary  Appendix  A  presents  detailed  cost  estimates.  Cost  estimates  were\ncompiled in COSTAB according to ADB guidelines. The total cost of the Project is estimated at\naround $1 million. This excludes the effects of inflation, but includes base costs plus physical\ncontingencies.\n3.  Cost Streams\n43. Cost stream were calculated for the Project including all costs incurred to construct,\noperate,  and  maintain  the  project  facilities  over  their  useful  life.  Cost  streams  were  also\nexpressed in real terms for the calculation of the FIRR.", "41 Appendix 7, page 9\n44. Future cost streams fall in three classifications: the institutional and management costs\nof running Hera Port; the cost of keeping and maintaining the environmental aspects of the port;\nand the general running and maintenance of the port, specifically related to the Project.\n45. FMES has been downsized in terms of personnel. The strategic plan emphasizes that a\nmajor characterization of the future institutional framework will be low reliance on staff number\nand high reliance on private sector involvement in the sector. Therefore, a staffing structure of\nonly four people is envisaged in this analysis for the institutional and management costs of the\nport. A vehicle is included in the costs associated with the Project. However, none of the\nestimated costs will be met by the project investment. These will all be additional costs that\nmust be borne by the new administration. The estimated annual cost after setup is $14,600.\n46. The environment cost is estimated at $2,400 per annum and the O&M cost estimated at\n$6,000  per  annum.  The  environmental  cost  is  an  estimate  covering  the  chemical  cost  of\ncleaning the port as a result of oil/diesel and other discharges. The O&M cost is associated with\nthe provision of buildings, disposal of waste fish and other items, and supply of water and other\ndisposable items not recoverable by charging the users of the port.\n4.  Financial Internal Rate of Return\n47. In conclusion, the effect of this size of investment with the revenues and costs generated\nis that it will produce an FIRR of 6.8 percent. The initial investment is a grant and therefore does\nnot have to be repaid, but the investment in this Project does not meet the ADB\u2019s standard\nthreshold of an opportunity cost of capital (OCC) of 12 percent, but this standard may not be\napplicable in East Timor. The weighted average cost of capital was not calculated because of\nthe difficulties of obtaining adequate information.\n48. The  salvage  value  is  based  on  the  fact  that  the  Project  is  mainly  hard  rock  and\nreinforced concrete, and as such should last well past the life of the Project. Depreciation is\ntherefore based on a 2 percent diminishing value.\n49. However, for an infrastructure project such as this port rehabilitation Project, the FIRR\nresult alone should not be the only consideration and should be viewed in conjunction with the\neconomic analysis.\n50. From a financial point of the view, with the initial investment being a grant, O&M costs\nmust be met from future activities. The expected annual revenues exceed expected annual\ncosts by four times. This is a positive outcome of the financial analysis. Refer (Table A7.8)\nF.  Economic Analysis\n51. East Timor is primarily an agricultural economy, with 90 percent of the population living\nin rural areas and 75 percent of the labor force engaged in agriculture, primarily subsistence\nagriculture. The economic framework has changed dramatically as East Timor can no longer\nrely on transfers from the Indonesian Government. External financing now plays a major role in\nthe economy, but this will be relatively short term, thus sustainable projects will form the\nbackbone of future development potential.\n52. One of the major problems facing East Timor is the state of damaged infrastructure,\nincluding roads, bridges, and ports. This has hindered the recovery of the fishing sector, among\nother sectors, and the fish catch has been reduced to approximately one third of the catch in the", "42 Appendix 7, page 10\npreconflict period. The present catch is restricted to inshore fishing resources (up to about 3 km\nfrom  the  shore)  due  to  the  lack  of  vessels  with  the  capacity  to  fish  further  out.  The  risk\nassociated with this situation is that the resources for subsistence fishing will be depleted over\ntime, in addition to a negative impact on the environment with deterioration in the reefs.\n53. Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)5  per  capita  ranged  between  $374  to  $424  during\n1995/98, making East Timor one of the poorest provinces during the Indonesian occupation.\nThis level of GDP also ranks East Timor as one of the poorest countries in the world.\n54. The rehabilitation of Hera Port offers the country a variety of economic benefits. Care\nhas been taken to ensure that the claimed benefits equate only to the incremental effect of the\nport rehabilitation and that these benefits only bring the capacity of the fisheries operations back\nto the preconflict levels, thus ensuring no inflated claims for exaggerated increases in the\nfisheries sector. 6\n1.  Fish Catch Recovery\n55. Even  without  the  Project  and  rehabilitation  of  Hera  Port,  in  time  the  fish  catch  is\nexpected to increase. Two major factors must be considered:\n(i)  Without the Project, the pressure will continue on the existing inshore fishing\nstock, over time these stock will be depleted. This type of fishing will also have a\ncollateral negative effect on the reefs.\n(ii)  Without the Project, no safe harbor is available for the larger boats that will be\nnecessary to access the offshore fishing grounds of East Timor.\n56. According to FMES, the fish catch is expected to be easily sustainable at 15,000-20,000\ntons per annum within the exclusive economic zone (yet to be negotiated and finalized), which\nwould provide the East Timorese with a per capita annual consumption level of 22.43 kg of fish\nprotein. However, this will require substantial development within the sector, and will need more\nthan the rehabilitation of Hera Port to achieve these levels.\n57. FAO has an indicative annual level of 13 kg of fish protein per capita, for a balanced\nintake in the food group of a nation. East Timor is presently producing a catch of approximately\n950 tons, which gives a per capita consumption of 1.22 kg representing only 9 percent of the\nrecommended fish protein intake. Even if fishing levels are brought back up to preconflict levels\nof 2,800 tons (paras. 1-8) this will only result in a per capita amount of 3.5 kg, or 26 percent of\nthe recommended fish protein levels.\n58. These calculations do not include the subsistence fishing currently being carried out, and\nthis will be ignored for the economic analysis of the rehabilitation. 7 The present catch is being\nachieved by small boats or bigger canoes, and is being brought to shore by just landing on the\n                  \n5  The term GDP is used here for clarity; at the time the figures would have been referred to GRP (gross regional\nproduct) as East Timor was a region of Indonesia.\n6  The project performance audit report of 31 December 1997, Fisheries Infrastructure (Sector) Project (Loan 693-\nINO) specifically targeted the project preparation report as making \u201cexaggerated increases in the fishing sector.\u201d\nTherefore, this proposal aims to ensure that the lessons learned have been taken and that no inflated claims are\nmade.\n7  The reason for ignoring the subsistence fishing is two-fold (i) it cannot be measured at this time and no records are\navailable to substantiate an educated guess, and (ii) the benefits calculated are done so within the confines of the\ncommercial catch available to the people of Indonesia, up to the preconflict levels.", "43 Appendix 7, page 11\nbeach. The size of boat using the port will be as before the conflict, 11 m craft, Japanese style,\nwith a capacity of 5 gross tons.\n59. Without the Project, the present fleet of 4 to 5 boats is expected to continue to operate\nad hoc and continue to land their catch on the beach. Nevertheless a catch will be landed and is\nassumed to be 980 tons. Even without the Project, the catch is assumed to increase by 200\ntons per annum. Any economic benefit in the first few years that may accrue due to the fish\ncatch is considered to be offset by the economic cost of importing beef. Therefore it may be\nmore  conservative  to  delay  the  benefit  until  the  fish  price  becomes  competitive  and  the\npopulation can then resume including fish in its diet.\n60. Rehabilitation of the port will provide facilities and services to these 4 or 5 boats (lets us\nassume 5). The port is anticipated to act as a catalyst for more boats to enter the sector at the\nrate of 5 in year 1, 5 in year 2, 5 in year 3, 5 in year 4, and thus reaching a possible port\ncapacity of 20 boats.\n61. The 11 m boats (5) at the start will land 1 load per week and will reach the capacity of 2\ntons per boat. In addition the 25 sailing canoes with a capacity of 300 kg are expected to land a\ncatch twice per week.\nTable A7.3: Fish Catch Recovery\n(tons per annum)\nScenario 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nWithout the project 980 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,500\nWith the project 980 1,300 1,820 2,340 2,860\nIncremental catch 0 300 620 940 1,360\nSource:  Staff consultant estimates.\n62. The many species and sizes of fish, along with lack of time and FMES data make\nidentifying the diversity of the catches impossible. Therefore the consultant visited various stalls\nalong the waterfront in Dili and asked the market price of various fish, in addition to discussion\nwith local families and FMES, and has assessed the price per kg of fish to be $5.3.\n63. Once the catch reaches the preconflict levels, the price of fish is assumed to drop to\nlevels representing 50 percent of the current price in the first three years and thereafter 30\npercent of the present price.8\n64. Thus incremental price savings per kg are calculated.\n65. Fish will then be a likely substitute for beef in the diet of the East Timorese. The price of\nbeef per kg is at present $3.1.\n66. The economic benefits therefore are calculated by taking the price of fish away from the\nprice of beef. After four years fish will become a viable economic substitute for beef; therefore,\neconomic benefits accruing to the fish catch recovery are delayed until year five.\n                  \n8  Based on discussions with FMES and project officer.", "44 Appendix 7, page 12\n2.  Fish Handling\n67. The  present  method  of  landing  fish  is  by  beach  access.  No  storage  facilities  are\navailable and the fishers usually dispense with the fish on a first-come, first-served basis.\n68. The present practice of landing fish on the beaches of Dili and other beaches in the\nprovinces is proving to be both wasteful and dangerous. FMES estimates a catch loss of 50\npercent within 24 hours; in an attempt to recover the losses, traders are producing dried fish\nfrom the residue resulting in sickness throughout the country. Access to ice would prolong the\nshelf-life of the catch by 18 days. Hera Port already has this facility in place.\n69. For the economic analysis the incremental fish catch was ignored; the analysis only\naddresses the existing catch and the projected catch for the without-project scenario. Twenty-\nfive percent of the 50 percent of fish lost is recovered by the selling of dried fish. In the analysis,\nthe value difference in the fresh fish and the dried fish was assessed and applied to the amount\nrecovered.\n70. In other words: the value of lost stock is assessed and then the recovery through the\nsales of dried fish is deducted to find the value of wastage. The project, through the application\nof ice and storage facilities is then assumed to save 75 percent of the net losses.\n3.  Fleet Protection and O&M\n71. The fishing fleet is in a bad state of repair. Only 4 or 5 boats are operational out of a fleet\nof 24. The port will offer safe anchorage and access to repair and maintenance facilities; the\nfleet is expected to rejuvenate at a rate of 5 boats per annum. In practice this may be quicker,\nbut this is the assumption used in the economic analysis. The port will offer, in the longer term,\nthe opportunity for the fishing fleet to keep operational through better O&M services\n72. Two basic economic benefits arise due to rehabilitation of the port. The first is the\nrecovery of the fleet to preconflict levels. This is expected to take five years. The value of the\nfleet was assessed according to previous production costs: 11 m Japanese Bonito-class boats\ncost $32,000 to produce and 14 m Lorosae-class boats cost $45,000. The preconflict value of\nthe fleet was then calculated at $698,000. This cost will not be met from the Project, but is\nexpected to come from future private sector investment. From this calculated value, a deduction\nwas made of 40 percent as an assessed cost of repair. The residual value was then assumed to\nbe the economic value of the rehabilitated fleet.\n73. In addition, due to the safer anchorage of the port, the reduced O&M costs for the fleet\nare assumed to be equivalent to 10 percent of the cost value of the fleet.\n4.  Inshore Fish Stock and Reefs\n74. FMES is currently trying to assess the stock in the inshore fisheries and to document the\nexisting reef system. Until this exercise is completed, stock cannot be evaluated.\n75. As an alternative, the view has been taken that the existing fishing levels are a result of\ninshore fishing \u2013 in fact any view to the contrary could not be substantiated due to the lack of\nadequate fishing vessels to fish further offshore.", "45 Appendix 7, page 13\n76. At one level, with or without the Project, a certain incremental increase in fishing levels\ninshore is assumed to take place and this is factored into the calculations at an increase of 200\ntons per year.\n77. Therefore the benefit provided by the Project is assumed to be the resource cost saving\nattributable to incremental fishing over and above the first level of projected incremental fish.\nThis incremental value has been valued at preconflict prices, i.e. $1.3/kg.\n78. This then is based on an assumption that present levels of fishing inshore will increase\nby 200 tons, and the incremental fishing over and above those levels will be from outside of this\narea in deeper water. The economic value is calculated on a one-to-one basis in the absence of\nreliable data and on the assumption that a one-to-one ratio will be roughly equal to a fish value,\nless production costs, plus savings on the value of the reef.\n5.  Socioeconomic Impact\n79. Ssocioeconomic data is unavailable at this time. Therefore no in-depth analysis was\ncarried out for this study. The basis for claiming economic benefits is the profit and loss account\nof the incremental fishers who will come into, or return to the industry.\n80. The capacity of each boat was calculated and the number of crew assessed. The value\nof each catch was calculated and the frequency appropriate to that type of vessel was applied.\nFrom the revenue generated, deductions were made for fuel, water, O&M, and wastage, giving\na gross profit figure. The gross profit was divided equally among the crewmembers, as is the\npractice in East Timor. The only benefits calculated were for the incremental boats that are\nexpected to enter the industry over the next five years.\n6.  Economic Internal Rate of Return\n81. The incremental net economic cash flow over 30 years yields an EIRR of 87 percent.\nThis is above the consistent level achieved for other ADB-funded rural infrastructure projects.\n82. Because the fishing industry has been destroyed, this economic analysis is almost\nrevaluing the startup of a fishing industry. Very few statistical records (due to the \u201cscorched\nearth policy\u201d employed by the departing Indonesians) exist on which to base the analysis, and\nmany benefits were not considered in this analysis, due to the time frame allotted to this\nemergency funding request.\n83. The results of the economic analysis are provided in full detail in TableA7.10.\nG.  Impact on Poverty\n84. The analysis to assess the poverty impact of this Project reflects the ADB guidelines\nincorporated  in  the  Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, the  Handbook for\nIntegrating Poverty Impact in the Economic Analysis of Projects The analysis includes both a\ndistribution analysis of project benefits and a poverty impact analysis.", "46 Appendix 7, page 14\n85. According to the ADB discussion paper of March 2001 on the poverty assessment in\nEast  Timor,9  75  percent  of  the  population  is  living  below  the  poverty  line.  While  certain\ndisclaimers are provided for the results of that assessment, there is no doubt that with the\npresent price of fish at approximately $5.3 per kg, the majority of the East Timorese are\nexcluded from including fish in their diet.10 It is assumed, in the absence of any other reliable\ndata, that the FAO guideline for the minimum yearly food consumption of fish per capita is\napplicable to the poverty line.\n86. To examine the poverty impact, the existing situation and the relationship between\nproduction and the coverage of the kg per capita daily intake at the poverty line, based on the\nFAO guideline of 13 kg per capita per year for fish protein (or 0.036 kg per capita per day) were\nconsidered (Table A7.4).\nTable. A7.4: Present Day Production Ratio to Per Capita Daily Intake at the Poverty Base\nItem Calculation\nA. Production forecast for 2000   950 tons per annum\nB.

Production coverage (percentage) 8 percent\nc = capita, d = day, kg = kilogram\nSource: Staff consultant estimates.\n87. Secondly, we will examine the future production\u2019s ability to meet demand at the absolute\npoverty line without interventions (Table A7.5).\nTable. A7.5: Future Production Ratio to Per Capita Daily Intake Without the Project at the\nPoverty Base\nItem Calculation\nA. Production forecast for 2015    3,600 tons per annum\nB. Population forecast for 2015 1,019,103 (National)\nC. A divided by B, divided by 365 0.010 kg/c/d\nD. Kilograms per capita daily intake at poverty line 0.036 kg/c/d\nE. Production coverage (percentage) 28 percent\nc = capita, d = day, kg = kilogram\nSource: Staff consultant estimates.\n88. Without the Project, the coverage ratio has increased to 28 percent of the kg per capita\ndaily intake at the poverty line. This clearly shows that without intervention, the fisheries sector\ncannot achieve the production levels required.\n89. Finally, the with-project scenario was analyzed (Table A7.6).\n                  \n9  ADB. 2001. East Timor Discussion Papers on Poverty Assessment and Strategies for Equitable Growth and\nPoverty Reduction.\n10 The ADB March 2001 study determined the poverty line based on the food basket of preconflict basket but now the\nprimary protein intake comes from beef (Australian beef brought in by UNTAET, etc) instead of fish, and the current\nfish price is excessively high compared with preconflict days and perhaps steady-state economy in the future.", "47 Appendix 7, page 15\nTable A7.6: Future with the Project Production Ratio to Per Capita Daily Intake at the\nPoverty Base\nItem Calculation\nA. Production forecast for 2015 7,500 tons per annum\nB. Population forecast for 2015 1,019,103 (National)\nC. A divided by B, divided by 365 0.020 kg/c/d\nD. Kilograms per capita daily intake at poverty line 0.036 kg/c/d\nE. Production coverage (percentage) 56 percent\nc = capita, d = day, kg = kilogram\nSource: Staff consultant estimates.\n90. The effect of doing nothing in the project area will result in only an increase in the\ncoverage of fish production to the per capita daily intake, at the poverty line, from 8 percent to\n28 percent. While the Project alone cannot achieve 100 percent coverage of the per capita\nproduction ratios at the poverty line it can assist to produce 56 percent of the per capita daily\nintake.\n91. Therefore the Project is highly desirable in terms of population-driven demand at the\npoverty base. However, other interventions are required; this Project alone does not meet or\ndeliver the quantity of fish protein required by the expanding population. This analysis is only to\nshow that the demand gap must be closed and this Project can contribute to narrowing that gap.\nH.  Distribution of Net Economic Benefits\n92. In this Project\u2019s case, the difference between financial and economic flows derives from\nthe project generating economic benefits that are not captured as financial benefits. The net\nsteams of both financial and economic flows are discounted at the economic discount rate of 12\npercent.\n93. For the distribution analysis an SWF of labor (the ratio of true opportunity cost to the\nfinancial wage rate paid by the project) is assumed to be necessary to apply to the labor\ncolumn. In the absence of any firm data and some anecdotal evidence about huge employment\nqueues for United Nation construction projects, a conservative SWF of 0.5 (implying 50 percent\nunemployment) is assumed.\n94. The analysis of the difference in economic and financial flows and their allocation is\npresented in Table A7. 7.\n95. The recovery of the fishing industry is assumed to have a direct impact on the consumer.\nAt present the local consumer does not have access to fish, due to the artificially high market\nprice brought about through the overwhelming presence of the large United Nations force and\nthe scarcity of the fish being harvested. Therefore 100 percent of the economic benefit is\nassumed to go directly to the consumer.\n96. Savings due to the restoration of storage facilities (none exist at the moment) are\nassumed to benefit all fishers equally, regardless of the size of boat.\n97. Fleet protection benefits are assumed to benefit mainly the larger and medium-sized\nboats, at percentages of 75 percent and 25 percent respectively, as the smaller canoes can\nrepair boats from natural resources on the beaches.", "48 Appendix 7, page 16\n98. FMES is currently assessing the inshore fish stocks and reefs and there is no value to\nuse at this point. However a methodology has been used for this purpose, refer to above\nparagraph 73. All of the benefit is assumed to be for the subsistence fishers and the FMES will\ndiscourage commercial fishing of inshore stock. The future government will therefore have the\ncost of protection and enforcement; this cost is assumed to be 10 percent of the value of the\nbenefits.", "Table A7.7:  Distribution of the Net Economic Benefits and the Poverty Impact Ratio\n($ '000, Present values at 12% Discount Rate)\n \nDifference Distribution of Net Economic Benefits\nFinancial Conversion Economic Economic Government/ Large Medium Small\nPresent Factor Present minus Economy Boat Boat Canoe Private\nItem Values Values Financial Owners Owners Owners Consumers Sector Labor\nIncremental Benefits\nRevenues\nLanded Fish Fees                    2 00               1.00                    2 00 0\nBerthage Fees                      6 2               1.00                      6 2 0\nMooring Fees                      6 1               1.00                      6 1 0\nIce Plant Rental                      7 4               1.00                      7 4 0\nCold Storage                      8 5               1.00                      8 5 0\nLease/Rentals                      5 6               1.00                      5 6 0\nWater Sales                      8 3               1.00                      8 3 0\nFuel Sales                      2 9               1.00                      2 9 0\nWorkshop Training                        8                1.00                        8  0\nAccomodation                      1 7               1.00                      1 7 0\nExport Packaging                      1 1               1.00                      1 1 0\nSubtotal                    6 86                    6 86 0\nFish Catch Recovery               2 8,259             28,259          28,259\nFish Handling  \nUnloading/Storage                 5 ,235               5,235         1,745         1,745         1,745\nFleet Protection/O&M                    7 62                  762            571            190\n4\nInshore Fish Stocks & Reef               3 1,204             31,204             (3,120)          31,204        621 9\nSocio-economic Impact                    6 21                  621\nADB Grant          1 ,275,023               1.00          1 ,275,023 0\nNPV of Total Benefits          1 ,275,709          1 ,341,790             66,081             (3,120)         2,316         1,935         1,745          59,463 0        621\n \nCosts  \nInvestment Costs          1 ,275,023               1.00          1 ,275,023 0\nOperating & Maintenance Costs  \nIncremental Administration Costs             1 23,623         ( 123,623)\nEnvironmental O&M               1 7,190           ( 17,190)\nOther O&M               4 2,974           ( 42,974)\nInterest 0 0 0 0\nPrinciple 0 0 0 0\nNPV of Total Costs          1 ,458,810          1 ,275,023         ( 183,787)\n0\nNet Present Value            (183,101)               6 6,767           249,868\nA\nTotal p\nGains and Losses             (3,120)         2,316         1,935         1,745          59,463       -         621       62,960 p\ne\nProportion for the Poor 14% 50% 75% 1% 75% 100% n\nNet Benefits for the Poor                (437)         1,158         1,451              17          44,597          621       47,408 d\nix\nPoverty Impact Ratio 75%  \n7\n,\n \nNPV = Net present value, O&M = Operation and Maintenance. p\na\nSource:  Staff consultant estimates. g\ne\n \n1\n7", "50 Appendix 7, page 18\nI.  Poverty Impact Analysis\n99. Table  A7.7 shows the calculation of a PIR for this Project is 75 percent. This result was\nsubjected to a sensitivity analysis whereby (i) none of the benefits accruing to the larger boats\nare assumed to reach the poor, and (ii) the proportion of poor in consumers are assumed at 50\npercent instead of 75 percent, assuming that as people become better fed by cheaper fish then\nnational poverty incidence may go down in the later part of the Project. The result in the event of\nboth of these events happening was a robust PIR of 51 percent.\n100. From the distribution analysis the gains and losses to the economy as a result of the\nProject need to be analysed to determine the proportion that will affect the poor. Each of the net\neconomic benefits/losses within the economy will have an impact, the problem is to identify how\nmuch will reach the poor. The following assumptions were made in the model.\n101. For the share in the overall economic benefit of the Project (Government share) the\nmethodology outlined in ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact in Economic Analysis\nof Projects, was applied. Table A7.12 shows the results.\n102. Because 75 percent of the population is living below the poverty line, this share is\napplied to those benefits that accrue to these groups.\n103. It is assumed that of the larger boats 50 percent will be owned and operated by that\nportion of the population currently classified as being is the band of 75 percent living below the\npoverty line. Similarly, 75 percent of medium-sized boat owners, and 100 percent of smaller\nsailing boat owners are assumed to be living below the poverty line for this analysis.", "Apppendix 7, page 19\n51\nTable
