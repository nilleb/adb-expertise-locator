INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  reconnaissance  mission1 in  April  2011,  the  Government  of  Mongolia \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to develop the \ngovernment bond market. A TA fact-finding mission visited Ulaanbaatar from 27 to 30 June \n2011, during which an understanding was reached on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, cost \nestimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting \nservices. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Despite  extensive  natural  resources,  a  significant  portion  of  Mongolia\u2019s  population \nremains in poverty because it cannot mobilize its economic potential effectively. The most \nserious constraint is the underdevelopment of the financial markets, which cannot facilitate the \naccumulation and efficient allocation of the capital necessary for economic development. To \novercome this constraint, the government has started several initiatives to develop its financial \nmarkets. One of these is the development of the government bond market.  \n \n3.  A developed government bond market can provide various benefits for the economy. \nWith a deep and liquid market for government bonds, governments can reduce funding costs \nand  improve  risk  management.  In  addition,  a  developed  government  bond  market  can \nstrengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy by establishing a yield curve through which the \neffects  of  monetary  policy  are  transmitted.  Aside  from  these  macroeconomic  benefits,  the \ndevelopment of a government bond market also contributes to the development of related \nfinancial  markets.  For  example,  establishment  of  the  benchmark  yield  curve  facilitates  the \ndevelopment of the corporate bond market. In addition, as risk-free assets, government bonds \ncan be the basis for the development of various financial products, including money market \ninstruments,  repurchase  agreements,  and  derivatives.  Developed  and  diversified  financial \nmarkets will enhance the efficiency of financial intermediation through greater competition and \nthe  development  of  related  financial  infrastructure.  This  leads  to  a  lowering  of  financial \ntransaction costs, which can improve access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises \nand households and eventually promote economic growth. \n \n4.  Mongolia  urgently  needs  to  develop  an  efficient  government  bond  market.  The \ngovernment plans to issue a significant amount of bonds to fund various public projects, and an \nefficient government bond market would enable the government to reduce the cost and the risk \nrelated to debt management. The government currently issues debt on an as-needed basis \nwithout any regular schedule. In the absence of a regular issuance of government bonds, there \nis no established benchmark yield curve in Mongolia. The lack of a proper yield curve hinders \nthe proper pricing of financial products and results in the underdevelopment of related financial \nmarkets such as the corporate bond market. \n \n5.  To develop a government bond market, policy makers need to give careful consideration \nto a number of issues: (i) sound and stable fiscal and monetary policies to secure the credibility \nof the government as a debt issuer; (ii) effective legal, tax, and regulatory infrastructure; (iii) \nefficient market infrastructure for the primary and secondary markets including the auction, \nclearing, settlement, and depository systems; (iv) active and qualified intermediaries such as \n                                                 \n1  The mission comprised N. Chakwin, previously Director of EAPF and now Resident Director General of European \nRepresentative Office and H. Lee, Financial Sector Specialist of EAPF, EARD \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 March 2011. \n ", "2   \nbrokers and dealers; and (v) a broad investor base including institutional investors. Although the \ngovernment  has  already  taken  a  number  of  necessary  steps,  significant  improvement  is \nrequired in most of these areas. Since the recent financial crisis, the government has worked \nwith international donors to improve its fiscal and monetary policy framework. As regards the \nlegal and regulatory framework, the government is continuing to improve its Law on Securities \nand  related  implementing  regulations.  In  late  2010,  the  government  outsourced  the \nmanagement of the Mongolian Stock Exchange (MSE) to upgrade its operation. However, most \nof these improvements are still in progress and far from completion. In addition, there are some \nareas that require further policy action: (i) improving the auction system in the primary market, \n(ii) developing qualified intermediaries, and (iii) broadening the investor base. \n \n6.  Among these three areas, development of the proper auction system in the primary \ngovernment bond market is the most urgent. Currently, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) issues \ngovernment bonds with a maturity of up to 7 years. For the issuance of government bonds, the \nMOF uses auctions through the MSE on an irregular basis.3 Almost all of the amounts issued \nare purchased by the commercial banks at the price set by the MOF, which is unduly low.4 Lack \nof a proper market-based pricing mechanism discourages private investors from purchasing \ngovernment  bonds.5 In  turn,  the  lack  of  investors  hinders  the  development  of  financial \ninstitutions that intermediate the transaction of government bonds. \n \n7.  The  TA  will  help  to  develop  the  government  bond  auction  system.  A  comparative \nanalysis of several options to improve the government bond auction platform needs to be \nconducted. Currently, there are three possible options for the MOF: (i) continuing to use MSE\u2019s \nauction platform, (ii) integrating it with the Bank of Mongolia\u2019s auction platform for central bank \nbills,  and  (iii)  developing  a  new  auction  platform  customized  to  the  MOF\u2019s  needs.  Each \nalternative has its own strengths and weaknesses. To name a few, MSE\u2019s auction system is \nopen to all investors including non-banking financial institutions and individual investors while \nBOM\u2019s system is only accessible to banks. However, BOM\u2019s auction system might be more \nefficient and secure than other alternatives in terms of its connectivity to the payment system. \nMeanwhile, the new system can be developed to meet market\u2019s needs most effectively although \nit might cause some concerns on cost and duplication of investment. The detailed strengths and \nweaknesses of each option will be analyzed and then a recommendation will be made for the \nupgrading of the auction platform, either by improving one of the existing systems or designing a \nnew system. While upgrading the auction platform, the TA will also give careful consideration to \nenhancing the security of transactions. In addition, the TA will consider how to improve the \noverall auction design, including pricing, scheduling, and control over participants. Finally, the \nTA will also provide capacity development opportunities for MOF staff and market participants. \n \n8.  Besides improving the auction system, long-term issues also need to be addressed. \nDeveloping qualified intermediaries is important to ensure efficient price discovery and reduce \nthe transaction costs for bondholders. Thus, the MOF would like to introduce the primary dealer \nsystem. However, there is a debate as to whether it is desirable to introduce this system in \nMongolia at this stage. Therefore, the MOF needs advice on the measures needed to develop \nfinancial intermediaries, including the primary dealer system. \n                                                 \n3  The MOF has no predetermined auction schedule and conducts auctions on an as-needed basis. Therefore, the \nnumber of auctions conducted has been very volatile. For example, 23 auctions were conducted in 2001 but none \nin 2009. \n4  For example, the yield of the 7-year maturity government bond issued in August 2011 was 9% while the yield of the \n12-week central bank bill was 11.72%. \n5  Although participation in the primary auction is open to all financial institutions and individual investors, only a small \nnumber of big commercial banks participate in the auction. \n ", "  3\n9.  Broadening the investor base is also critical as its size and diversity can help to increase \nmarket liquidity through greater competition and a diverse risk appetite. In Mongolia, almost all \ngovernment bonds are purchased by a small number of big commercial banks, which usually \nhold them to maturity. Therefore, it is important for the MOF to develop and implement policies \nthat will foster the participation of institutional investors. \n \n10.  For ADB operations in Mongolia, public sector management is a core, crosscutting \ntheme to help the government increase the efficiency in managing the abundant revenues that \nmining  generates.  Furthermore,  support  for  public  sector  management  aims  to  improve \ngovernment financial management and aid effectiveness, expand the role of public\u2013private \npartnerships,  combat  corruption,  and  strengthen  the  financial  market  to  support  long-term \ninvestment. Government bond market development in Mongolia is critical for ADB to achieve \nthese  goals,  especially  the  improvement  of  government  financial  management  and  the \nstrengthening of the financial market. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be developed financial markets based on a more efficient \ngovernment  bond  market.  The  achievement  of  this  impact  will  be  demonstrated  through \ndevelopment of the benchmark yield curve and the emergence of various financial products. \nThe TA\u2019s outcome will be a functional primary government bond market established. This \noutcome  is  to  be  demonstrated  through  the  regular  issuance  of  government  bonds  and \nincreased participation in auctions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will assist the government in developing the government bond market through \nimproving  market  infrastructure  and  broadening  the  investor  base.  As  regards  market \ninfrastructure,  the  TA  will  focus  on  upgrading  the  primary  auction  system  and  developing \nfinancial intermediaries. The TA will conduct a comparative analysis of the various options for \nthe primary auction system and provide policy recommendations for improving the current \nsystem. If necessary, the TA will support the procurement of the new auction software and \nrelated services from a globally renowned service provider. In addition, the TA will assist the \nMOF in developing the necessary institutional structure, including the primary dealer system, for \nthe development of financial intermediaries. It will also support the MOF in addressing the long-\nterm issue of broadening the investor base for government bonds. During TA implementation, \nvarious opportunities for capacity development as well as relevant knowledge products will be \nprovided for MOF staff and market participants. \n \n13.  The TA will deliver five major outputs: \n \n(i)  Upgraded government bond auction platform. Several options for the MOF \nwill be analyzed including the systems operated by the MSE and the Bank of \nMongolia. Based on the analysis, recommendations will be made on how to \nimprove the current auction platform or whether to design a new one. \n(ii)  Improved general auction design. In addition to upgrading the auction platform, \nan enhanced auction design will improve the price discovery process and market \nefficiency.  Various  issues  will  be  covered,  including  pricing,  scheduling,  and \ncontrol over participants. \n ", "4   \n(iii)  Policies recommended for long-term development of the government bond \nmarket. Policy recommendations will be made on long-term issues to develop \nthe government bond market, such as developing financial intermediaries and \nbroadening the investor base. \n(iv)  Capacity developed for government staff and market participants. MOF staff \nand market participants will have opportunities for capacity development through \ntraining sessions, workshops, and seminars. \n(v)  Knowledge products provided. The TA will produce a short policy note, as well \nas several technical notes, as knowledge products targeting policy makers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund; and (ii) $500,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund,6 both \nadministered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office \naccommodation, transportation, office supplies and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  executing  agency  is  the  MOF  and  the  implementing  agency  is  the  Debt \nManagement Division in the MOF. The MOF and the Debt Management Division will (i) provide \nthe necessary office space, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services to consultants; \nand (ii) arrange meetings for consultants with relevant agencies and organizations. \n \n16.  The TA will engage three international consultants for 20 person-months and three \nnational consultants for 20 person-months. The government bond market expert will be the \nteam leader. Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). For equipment, training seminars, and conferences, advance payment facility \ncould be used. \n \n17.  The TA is expected to begin in 1 February 2012 and end on 31 December 2013. \nAssembling the TA team and preparing a detailed work plan will be completed within 2 months. \nThe TA will then proceed as follows: (i) analysis of the current status of the government bond \nmarket by month 4, (ii) upgrading of the auction platform by month 10, (iii) recommendations to \nimprove the overall auction design by month 13, and (iv) policy recommendations on long-term \nissues such as developing financial intermediaries and broadening the investor base by month \n20. Capacity development opportunities for government staff and market participants will be \norganized during TA implementation. \n \n18.  In addition to the main outputs, the consultants will submit to ADB and the MOF (i) \ninception reports 2 weeks after commencement of their services, (ii) interim progress reports at \nappropriate stages during TA implementation, (iii) draft final reports before the conclusion of the \ncontract, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after receiving comments from the MOF and ADB. All \nreports must be submitted in English. \n \n                                                 \n6  Contributor: the Government of Luxembourg. \n ", "  5\n19.
