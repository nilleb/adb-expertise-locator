The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  consists  of  Cambodia,  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC), Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \nIn 1992, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the GMS countries launched \nthe  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program  (the  Program)  to  strengthen  economic  linkages \namong them. The initial emphasis of cooperation was on building trust and confidence through \nspecific projects and programs to promote physical connectivity among the member countries. In \n2002,  the  countries  adopted  the  GMS  Strategic  Framework  2002\u20132012  (GMS-SF),  which \noutlined a more comprehensive subregional development agenda, underscoring the need to \nsupplement  infrastructure  linkages  with  cooperation  on  policies  and  programs  to  promote \nequitable and environmentally sustainable growth.1   \n \n2.  The midterm review of the GMS-SF, endorsed by the member countries in 2007, noted \nthat  although  the  Program  had  accelerated  and  made  significant  progress  in  pursuing  its \nstrategic priorities during the first half of the GMS-SF period, the precise scale and scope of the \nProgram\u2019s contribution to poverty reduction and other social indicators could not be determined \nbecause of a lack of information and methodological difficulties. It recommended establishing a \nsystem for monitoring and quantifying the poverty impact of GMS projects and programs.2    \n \n3.  The  proposed  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  aims  to  help  fill  this  gap  by \n(i) evaluating the socioeconomic effects of selected GMS projects that are ongoing or have been \ncompleted, with a view to providing quantitative estimates where feasible; (ii) constructing data \nsets  with  more  comprehensive  socioeconomic  indicators  to  aid  enhanced  monitoring  and \nevaluation  of  outcomes  and  impacts  in  subsequent  years;  and  (iii)  drawing  key  policy \nimplications  and  lessons  that  could  inform  the  design,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation of subregional projects in the GMS.3 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Cooperation among the GMS countries has intensified in recent years. By the end of \n2007, the Program had mobilized $10.1 billion in investment projects and $176.5 million in \ntechnical assistance (TA), of which ADB\u2019s support amounted to $3.6 billion for investments and \n$83.4 million for TA. More than two thirds of the funds for investment projects and 59% of TA \nwere mobilized in the 2002\u20132007 period, when the GMS-SF came into effect. The indicative \npipeline for 2009\u20132011 suggests that support for the Program is likely to increase further, with \n$3.1 billion in investment projects and $22.2 million in TA envisaged for the period.  \n \n5.  The  GMS  countries  have  identified  nine  priority  sectors  for  cooperation  under  the \nProgram\u2014transport,  telecommunications,  energy,  environment,  tourism,  trade  facilitation, \ninvestment, human resource development, and agriculture. Most of the funds for investment \nprojects under the Program have so far gone primarily to transport and, to a lesser extent, \nenergy, reflecting the necessity, in the first instance, of physical connectivity among member \n                                                 \n1  The thrusts of the GMS-SF are to (i) strengthen infrastructure linkages; (ii) facilitate cross-border trade, investment, \nand tourism; (iii) enhance private sector participation and competitiveness; (iv) develop human resources and skills; \nand (v) protect the environment and promote sustainable use of shared natural resources. \n2   ADB. 2007. Mid-Term Review of the Greater Mekong Subregion Strategic Framework (2002\u20132012). Manila (pages \n14, 38, and 40). For simplicity, the term \u201cproject\u201d, as used in this paper, encompasses both projects and programs. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 June 2008. It was originally \ntitled Enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation of GMS Projects. \n ", "2   \ncountries.  However,  in  recent  years,  as  physical  connectivity  improved  and  the  scope  for \ncooperation broadened, investment projects are gradually becoming more diverse.4 TA has \nhistorically encompassed a more diverse scope, including health, environment, tourism, capacity \ndevelopment, trade facilitation, and support for GMS institutional arrangements, among others. \nWhile some transport, energy, and a number of TA projects have been completed, the majority \nof projects under the Program are ongoing.   \n \n6.  The  status  of  the  Program  underscores  the  importance  of  better  understanding  its \nprojects\u2019 effects on the ground, especially as the scope and scale of its activities increase. There \nhave been few assessments of the socioeconomic effects of GMS projects.5 An ADB RETA \n(Reviewing the Impact of Regional Economic Integration in the Greater Mekong Subregion)6 \nassessed  the  effects  of  regional  integration  at  cross-border  points  along  the  East\u2013West \nEconomic Corridor and the Southern Economic Corridor in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and \nViet Nam. The responses of households surveyed varied by country, but respondents generally \nperceived significant benefits from cross-border linkages, including easier access to markets as \nwell  as  medical  and  other  services,  greater  opportunities  for  trade  and  employment,  and \navailability of cheaper goods.7 Among the key negative outcomes cited by households were the \nspread of HIV, smuggling of goods, human trafficking, and difficulties in coping with greater \ncompetition in labor and product markets.8  \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department (OED) is conducting an evaluation of ADB\u2019s \nregional  cooperation  assistance  program  for  the  GMS  this  year.  The  objectives  of  OED\u2019s \nevaluation are to (i) assess the achievement and distribution of the overall results of the Program; \n(ii) assess the extent to which the regional programs at the sector level have shown results; \n(iii) review how the clarity of ADB\u2019s strategic guidance, policies, procedures, and instruments \nhave contributed to or impeded implementation of the Program; and (iv) identify lessons and \nprovide input to the future direction of the Program.9  \n \n8.  This  RETA  will  ensure  complementarity  with  OED\u2019s  evaluation  by  (i)  focusing  on \nhouseholds and firms to assess socioeconomic impacts at the micro level, and (ii) constructing \ndata sets with more comprehensive socioeconomic indicators to aid enhanced monitoring and \nevaluation of outcomes and impacts in future years. It would also supplement the work done by \nOED and others by focusing on projects that have not yet been comprehensively assessed.  \n                                                 \n4  The share of transport projects in the total cost declined from 91% in 1992\u20132001 to 78% in 2002\u20132007, while that \nfor energy increased from 9% to 21% during the period. Two projects for controlling communicable diseases and \ndeveloping sustainable tourism were also initiated since 2002.

This RETA thus intends to augment the existing body of knowledge and contribute to a \nbetter understanding of the impacts of GMS projects. The assessment of socioeconomic effects \nwould provide important inputs to the Program\u2019s focus on results, and potentially improve the \nprioritization  and  selection  of  subregional  projects  and  initiatives.  The  work  is  expected  to \nprovide analytic structures that can be incorporated into future projects to better monitor and \nunderstand the impact of regional cooperation activities in GMS. An improved understanding of \nthe effects of GMS projects would be important, considering ADB\u2019s scaling up of assistance to \nsubregional projects as envisaged under its long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy \n2020), and the new regional cooperation partnership strategy for the GMS.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected outcome of the RETA is a better understanding of the socioeconomic \neffects of selected GMS projects. This is anticipated to contribute to enhanced development \neffectiveness of interventions by ADB and other development partners under the Program. A \ndraft outline of the final report is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  RETA  is  expected  to  focus  on  ADB-assisted  projects  on  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation, health, energy, and tourism, which comprise most of the assistance to the Program \nso far. The assessment of socioeconomic effects will generally follow a mixed-method approach. \nQualitative analysis (desk review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions) will help in \nunderstanding the context of the project, identifying the determinants of outcomes and impact, \nand describing causal chains for outcomes and impact, which could then be included in the \nquantitative assessments.11 These assessments will draw on household and enterprise surveys \nto be conducted as part of the RETA, as well as baselines reconstructed from secondary \nsources.  The  surveys  will  collect  data  on  various  relevant  indicators,  including  those  on \noutcomes and impacts and their potential determinants, for groups affected by the projects \n(project groups) and comparison groups. The surveys can be replicated in subsequent years to \ntrack outcomes and impact and, as such, their design will emphasize simplicity to facilitate \nfollow-up work.   \n \n12.  The RETA will be implemented in two stages.   \n \n(i)  Stage I: Diagnostic stage. In the first stage, diagnostic assessments will be \ncarried out to select specific projects for detailed work under the RETA. The \ncriteria for selection would include (a) the implementation stage of the project; \n(b) size, sector, and country coverage of the project; (c) the potential of the RETA \nto  inform  the  design  and  implementation  of  similar  projects  in  the  future; \n(d) existing knowledge about the project\u2019s effects and the potential contribution of \nthe  RETA  to  filling  any  gaps;  and  (e)  an  assessment  of  existing  data  and \ninformation  on  the  projects  from  project  databases,  official  censuses,  and \nsurveys, among others, to determine the work to be carried out under the RETA \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila (page 23). \n11  The context of the project includes the spatial as well as sectoral and broader policy and institutional environment \nthat could affect outcomes and impacts. \n ", "4   \nand  the  likely  rigor  with  which  socioeconomic  effects  of  projects  could  be \nestimated. Following the diagnostic assessment and selection of specific projects, \nan inception report will be prepared describing the scope, objectives, analytical \nframeworks for qualitative and quantitative assessments of the selected projects, \nand  implementation  details.  The  inception  report  will  be  finalized  following \nnational consultation workshops and a regional workshop with participation of key \nstakeholders. \n \n(ii)  Stage  II:  Data  collection,  analysis,  and  reporting.  The  second  stage  will \ncomprise  collection  of  data  and  information  for  qualitative  and  quantitative \nassessments of selected projects, analysis of their socioeconomic effects, and \nfinalization of country reports and an integrated regional report. The findings of \nthe assessments will be discussed in consultation workshops in each country and \nin regional workshops before the finalization of reports. The final country and \nregional reports will be translated into national languages for dissemination.  \n \n13.  The expected outputs of the RETA are as follows: \n \n(i)  Country reports and an integrated regional report including assessments of the \nsocioeconomic effects of the selected projects to provide lessons that could be \nincorporated  into  the  design,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of \nrelevant GMS projects. \n \n(ii)  A database of outcome and impact indicators and their potential determinants for \nselected GMS projects. The database will consist of information from the surveys \nconducted  under  the  RETA  and  from  secondary  sources,  including  official \nsurveys,  project  documents  and  databases,  development  partners, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), research institutions, and others.  \n \n14.  A number of methodological issues arise in the quantitative assessment of the projects\u2019 \nsocioeconomic  effects.  The  attribution  of  effects  to  specific  projects  will  require  adequate \ncontrols  for  relevant  characteristics  of  project  and  comparison  groups  that  may  determine \noutcomes and impact of selected projects\u2014apart from their participation in, or proximity to, to the \nproject. Some of these characteristics are observable in the data and could be included in the \nanalytical frameworks. Others may be unobservable in the data. In these cases, the rigor of the \nassessments will partly depend on the availability of adequate secondary data to reconstruct \nbaselines  for  selected  projects.  For  subregional  projects,  the  measurement  of  subregional \nbenefits and costs over and above national ones present another challenge. These risks will be \nmitigated  by  paying  attention  to  identification  of  suitable  comparison  groups,  and  by \nsupplementing the quantitative findings from the assessments with qualitative assessments and \nwith findings from other similar studies as appropriate.12  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the RETA, estimated at $950,000, will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The proceeds will cover consultants\u2019 services, surveys, and other \n                                                 \n12  See Bamberger, Michael, Jim Rugh, and Linda Mabry. 2006.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA. ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department will \nimplement the RETA in close consultation with GMS national coordinators and other relevant \nofficials  in  each  country,  and  in  cooperation  with  national  statistics  offices.  The  RETA  is \nexpected to be implemented over a period of 21 months starting in October 2008. No-objection \nletters  will  be  obtained  from  all  countries  where  RETA  activities  will  be  conducted  before \ncommencing the activities. \n \n17.  The RETA will be implemented in partnership with national research institutes (NRIs) in \neach  country,  and  will  require  the  services  of  international  and  national  consultants.  The \nconsultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The NRIs will be selected by ADB, in consultation with \nGMS national coordinators, based on the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection criteria. They will \nbe engaged under lump-sum contracts to perform the tasks indicated in their terms of reference, \nincluding diagnostic assessments to select projects, developing analytical frameworks, designing \nand  implementing  data  collection  instruments  in  cooperation  with  national  statistics  offices, \nconstructing databases, assessing selected projects, and organizing and facilitating workshops.  \n \n18.  The RETA will also require services of international consultants, on an individual basis, \nfor an estimated 12 person-months. The international consultants will consist of (i) a team leader \nand coordinator who will, among other tasks, collaborate with the NRIs to select projects for \ndetailed assessment under the RETA; ensure consistency of analytical frameworks; ensure \nconsistency  and  quality  of  data,  methodological  approaches,  and  reports  across  countries; \nprepare  the  integrated  regional  report;  and  facilitate  regional  workshops;  and \n(ii) economists/specialists, to be engaged as needed, with expertise in various areas relevant for \nassessment of selected projects. In addition, the RETA will engage a national consultant/analyst \non  an  individual  basis  for  9  person-months  to  assist  the  TA  supervising  unit  officer  in \ncoordinating the RETA activities. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.  \n \n19.  The NRIs will organize national consultation workshops at the inception, interim, and final \nstages in order to elicit feedback from diverse stakeholders. At each stage, national consultation \nworkshops will be followed by regional workshops to accommodate subregional perspectives \nand to coordinate approaches across countries. The findings of the RETA will also be presented \nat relevant meetings of the GMS sector working groups and at the GMS Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting \nas appropriate. The reports and the databases are expected to be made public on the GMS \nSecretariat\u2019s website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.
