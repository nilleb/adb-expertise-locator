INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will promote the development of \ndistributed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Uzbekistan. The country\u2019s vast renewable energy \nresources  are  largely  underdeveloped.  The  TA  will  (i)  support  the  development  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s sector strategy for distributed solar systems to improve the quality of electricity \nsupply in remote regions and to scale up distributed solar systems through private investments;1 \n(ii) install at least 20-kilowatt (kW) distributed solar PV system to demonstrate the technical \nfeasibility and socioeconomic benefits;2 and (iii) strengthen institutional capacity through hands-\non training in planning, designing, implementing, and operating the distributed solar PV systems. \nExpansion of distributed solar PV systems will enhance energy access and fulfill the government\u2019s \ncommitment to mitigate climate change impacts.  \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan for Uzbekistan, 2021\u20132023 as an ongoing program for 2020.3 The TA is aligned with the \nEnergy Policy 20094 and Strategy 2030 operational priorities5 1 (addressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities); 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality); 3 (tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability); and 6 \n(strengthening governance and institutional capacity).6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Benefiting from high commodity prices, Uzbekistan\u2019s economy grew at an average of more \nthan 7% a year during 2010\u20122014. However, unfavorable external conditions, such as declining \ncommodity prices and subdued growth of its trading partners, slowed Uzbekistan\u2019s economic \ngrowth from 6.1% in 2016 to 4.5% in 2017. In response, the country initiated comprehensive \neconomic reforms in 2017 to stimulate demand, foster foreign investment, and develop the private \nsector.  Uzbekistan  has  made  good  progress  on  the  economic  reforms,  while  achieving \nmacroeconomic stability. Major structural reforms include implementing foreign exchange and tax \nreforms, improving macro fiscal management, and restructuring state-owned enterprises. In 2019, \nthe government initiated comprehensive power sector reforms to (i) deregulate the monopoly \nstructure,  (ii)  streamline  and  strengthen  sector  oversight,  (iii)  create  a  power  market  and  a \ncompetitive environment, (iv) reduce carbon intensity, and (v) attract private investment.  \n \n4.  Beginning in 2010, Uzbekistan\u2019s demand for power increased with the upsurge driven by \nthe  industrial  and  residential  sectors.  However,  aging  power  infrastructure  and  insufficient \ninvestment have widened the supply\u2013demand gap, resulting in an unreliable electricity supply. \nThe country\u2019s installed power generation capacity is about 14 gigawatts (GW), but the available \ncapacity is estimated at less than 12.5 GW.7 Most power generation assets are 40\u201350 years old, \noperating beyond their useful life, and require replacement and/or rehabilitation. Uzbekistan\u2019s \n230,000 kilometers of transmission and distribution lines, with an average age of more than 30 \n \n1  In the Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 4779 (dated 10 July 2020), the government \nenvisioned the development of renewable energy resources (except hydropower plant) to be carried out through \ntransparent auction.  \n2  In the Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 4422 (dated 22 August 2019), the government \nenvisioned measures on an uninterrupted supply of energy resources to social facilities (such as preschools and \nhealth care facilities) through the phased installation of modern solar PV plants and solar water heaters.  \n3  ADB. 2020.

Manila.   \n ", " \n2 \nyears, have also exceeded their economic life. Therefore, utilities incur additional operation and \nmaintenance expenses to source spare parts that are no longer readily available and to cope with \nfrequent equipment outages.  \n \n5.  The unreliable power supply has undermined people\u2019s livelihoods and the profitability of \nbusinesses. Small enterprises suffer more because of the high cost of running diesel backup \ngenerators. Occasional power outages still occur in urban areas but they are particularly severe in \nrural and remote areas during the cold season from December to February when electricity demand \nsurges\u2014lasting from 6 hours a day to weeks in some villages. The unreliable supply has negatively \naffected businesses, households\u2019 quality of life, economic activity, and the delivery of social services. \nThe rural population has limited access to quality infrastructure services, exacerbating urban\u2013rural \ndisparities. Women, as the primary users of electricity in households, are disproportionately \naffected by the unstable and poor quality of the electricity supply.8 A reliable power supply would \nenable women to operate small enterprises and participate in income-generating and community \nactivities. \n \n6.  In 2019, the burning of fossil fuels generated 56,500 gigawatt-hours of electricity, or 88.8% \nof the country\u2019s total; the rest was from hydropower. The energy sector is the main source of \ngreenhouse gas emissions in Uzbekistan. At current natural gas production levels, proven gas \nreserves would last for only 20 years. Therefore, it is imperative for Uzbekistan to shift to a more \nsustainable energy system.9 In May 2019, the government adopted the Renewable Energy Law \nto support the long-term energy security of Uzbekistan and reduce its reliance on fossil fuels by \ndeveloping and regulating renewable energy resources. The government\u2019s power sector master \nplan lays out its commitment to a clean energy system and the targets of adding 5 GW of solar \npower and 3 GW of wind power by 2030. The aim is to generate 15% of the country\u2019s electricity \nfrom renewable sources (excluding hydropower) within 10 years.10  \n \n7.  The  government  envisions  multifaceted  measures  to  further  exploit  abundant  solar \nresources through (i) utility-scale solar PV projects under the public\u2013private partnership (PPP) \nmodality; (ii) small-scale distributed solar PV systems; and (iii) micro-scale solar home systems. \nBecause the sector relies heavily on limited sovereign financing, it is essential to unlock private \nsector participation to ensure adequate investment in solar projects. The government enacted the \nLaw on Public\u2013Private Partnership in 2019 to support and protect private investors from adverse \nchanges in the realization of their project with supplementary legislation. With the assistance of \nADB and other development partners, the government developed a bankable PPP structure and \nsupporting  mechanisms  for  large-scale  renewable  energy  projects.  These  measures  were \neffective in deploying utility-scale renewable energy projects and demonstrated by the first 100-\nmegawatt Navoi solar power project11 and subsequent solar and wind PPP projects.12 \n \n8.  While the recent advancement in developing large-scale renewable energy projects is \nnoteworthy, a complementary approach is needed where large energy projects are not viable \nsuch as areas with geographic complexity, remoteness, and low electricity demand. Distributed \nsolar PV systems can be affordable, reliable, and resilient energy solutions in such areas. \nHowever, unlike large-scale PPP projects, Uzbekistan does not have a clear regulatory framework \n \n8  Women spend almost 63% of their time on housekeeping activities, such as cooking, cleaning, laundering, ironing, \nand repairing clothing, compared with 12% spent by men on such activities. \n9  British Petroleum. 2019.

Established legal and regulatory \nframeworks are required to demonstrate the viability of adopting distributed solar PV systems. \nSuch frameworks will create an enabling market environment and influence the feasibility and \ngrowth potential. In similar interventions in other countries, ADB highlighted three key factors in \npromoting renewable energy: supporting the government in identifying policy issues, addressing \npolicy gaps, and building and sharing knowledge.13 Joint Stock Company Regional Electric Power \nNetworks (JSC REN), the owner and operator of the networks that distribute and sell electricity to \nconsumers, has limited experience in developing distributed solar PV systems. Developing the \nindigenous capacity of JSC REN and the capacity of related local stakeholders to plan, design, \ninstall, and operate distributed solar PV systems will support the wider adoption and sustainable \nlong-term operation of such systems.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  enabling  conditions  for  accelerated \ndevelopment of renewable energy resources created.14 The TA will have the following outcome: \nenabling environment for distributed solar PV development established.15  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Adequate regulatory frameworks to promote distributed solar PV system \ndeveloped. The TA will conduct technical and legal analyses to identify gaps in the policy and \nregulatory frameworks. The TA will provide practical implementation measures for the renewable \nenergy auction mechanism, which will allow more private investment in small-scale renewable \nenergy projects. Key activities will include (i) analysis of the policy, regulations, technical barriers \nfor grid interconnection, anticipated grid impact, and the adequacy of the grid code; (ii) review of \nthe tariff mechanism and infrastructure for net-metering16; (iii) development of a road map and \npolicy paper for the government by consolidating technical, regulatory, financial, and economic \nassessments;  (iv)  development  of  a  renewable  energy  auction  mechanism  with  a  related \nregulatory framework, comprehensive manual, platform, and sample transaction templates; and \n(v) study tours, stakeholder consultations, and workshops, including with local civil society \norganizations, to disseminate knowledge and international best practices.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Distributed solar PV systems applications supported. The TA will finance \na pilot project to install at least 20 kW distributed solar PV system that will be connected to the \nexisting distribution networks. Depending on the site characteristics and local energy needs, the \nintegration of a battery energy storage system or solar water heater will be considered. The pilot \nproject capacity and system configuration will be decided upon detailed due diligence. Key \nactivities will include (i) formulation of project selection criteria and assessment tools, taking into \naccount technical, financial, and socio-environment characteristics; (ii) conducting of technical \nand safeguards due diligence on the target projects; (iii) procurement and installation of pilot \n \n13 ADB. 2020.

Output  3:  Institutional  capacity  in  designing,  constructing,  and  operating \ndistributed solar PV systems strengthened. The TA will build the institutional capacity to plan, \ndesign, install, and operate distributed solar PV systems. It will focus on improving the capacity \nof JSC REN to review and study the grid impact of the integration of small-scale decentralized \npower  generators.  JSC  REN  staff  will  be  trained  to  enhance  understanding,  indigenous \nknowledge, and expertise in solar PV project design and implementation. Women will comprise \n50% of the training participants. Local stakeholders will be invited to the training and workshops. \n \n13.  ADB value addition. ADB has provided financial resources and targeted policy support \nto make the power sector more sustainable through various interventions. The TA will build on \nthat support and provide knowledge and policy assistance for scaling up renewable energy. The  \nTA will explore possible business models that would allow productive use of renewable generated \nelectricity with an emphasis on small businesses led by women and households likely to suffer \nmore from an inadequate electricity supply.17 The TA will bring together a suite of ADB services \nfrom the Central and West Asia Department and the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership. It will \nalso explore potential PPP projects and private investment opportunities in distributed renewable \nenergy system development. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.35 million, of which (i) $0.35 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6 $0.20 million and TASF-other \nsources $0.15 million) and (ii) $1.00 million will be financed on a grant basis by Clean Energy \nFund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.18 The key \nexpenditure items are in Appendix 2.  \n \n15.  The Clean Energy Fund resources will be used to finance operational expenses related to \nthe TA and/or local expenditures for goods, works, and services from ADB member countries \nfollowing ADB\u2019s applicable guidelines and procedures.19  \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of data and information, \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, logistics and administrative support, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from December 2020 to September 2022. ADB will administer \nthe TA through the Central and West Asia Department\u2019s Energy Division, with support from the \nUzbekistan Resident Mission. The Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Investment and Foreign \nTrade will ensure that the respective government agencies and municipal entities involved with \n \n17 ADB. 2020.
