INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) country programming midterm review \nmission, which took place in Beijing on 8\u20139 June 2010, the Government of the PRC requested \nthat the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a capacity development technical assistance \n(TA) for Developing Smart Grid Technology for Efficient Utilization of Renewable Energy in the \nPRC. The TA was included in ADB's 2010 nonlending pipeline for the PRC.1 The concept paper \nwas approved on 10 November 2010 and a memorandum of understanding was reached with \nthe Ministry of Finance and the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) during the fact-finding \nmission. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Like many other countries, the PRC has recognized that it is facing imminent and severe \nchallenges on energy security and climate change. The government has made great efforts to \nimprove  energy  efficiency  and  reduce  carbon  dioxide  (CO )  emissions.  For  example,  its \n2\nEleventh Five Year Plan (2006\u20132010) mandates a 20% reduction in energy intensity by 2010.2 \nIn 2006, the government announced plans to develop a low-carbon economy in the National \nEvaluation Report on Climate Change. In 2007, the government declared that it would promote \na  low-carbon  economy  by  improving  energy  efficiency,  developing  low-carbon  energy \ntechnology, expanding carbon sinks,3 and developing renewable energy.4 In November 2009 \nthe government announced its intention to reduce the carbon intensity5 of its gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) by 40%\u201345% by 2020 compared with the 2005 level.6 Being a high-priority area \nof the government, the energy sector is targeting a provision of 15% of total primary energy \nconsumption using renewable resources by 2020.  \n \n3.  The PRC is heavily dependent on coal for electricity production; it accounted for about \n80% of the total electricity produced in 20097 and about 50% of total CO  emissions in the \n2\ncountry.  Due  to  the  fact  that  there  are  a  number  of  renewable  technologies  available  for \nelectricity generation, the electricity sector is a key policy target area for addressing climate \nchange and delivering near- and long-term CO  emission reductions. A low-carbon development \n2\npath  requires  a  significant  portion  of  electricity  to  be  generated  from  renewable  energy \nresources. It is estimated that the PRC has about 1,000 gigawatts (GW) of exploitable wind \nresources.8 The rapid development of wind power has seen the capacity increase from 76 \nmegawatts (MW) in 2004 to about 17.6 GW in 2009 (footnote 7). This growth is expected to \ncontinue and the installed capacity is forecast to increase to 100.0 GW by 2020.  \n \n4.  However, this momentum for wind energy may be impeded unless some challenges \npertaining to grid integration of the dispersed renewable energy sources are addressed urgently. \nFirst, there is increased demand for adequate spinning reserve capacity to maintain the grid \nstability, as the existing electricity system is passively demand-driven. That is, when a consumer \nincreases  their  electricity  use,  generation  somewhere  in  the  system  has  to  increase  by  a \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 November 2010. \n2  This refers to the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP. \n3  A carbon sink is a natural or artificial feature, such as a forest, that absorbs and stores carbon, thereby removing it \nfrom the atmosphere.  \n4  President Hu Jintao made this declaration at the 15th Asia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Sydney, \nAustralia on 8 September 2007.  \n5  This refers to the amount of carbon emitted per unit of GDP. \n6  The announcement was made on 26 November 2009 as the PRC's commitment to tackling global climate change.   \n7  China Electricity Council. 2010. National Electricity Statistics 2009. Beijing. \n8  H. Xue, et al. 2001. Estimated Wind Energy Resources in China. Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica. Volume 2. Beijing.  \n ", "2   \ncommensurate amount to satisfy that demand. Due to the intermittency of wind, however, wind \npower cannot respond directly to changes in consumer demand. So, when a certain amount of \nwind power capacity is connected it has to be backed up by the addition of a similar amount of \nspinning reserve capacity using traditional technologies in order to maintain grid stability. This \ncreates additional costs for using wind power. At present, there is no generally accepted ceiling \nof wind power penetration.9 The limit for a particular grid will depend on many factors, such as \nexisting  dispatchable  power  plants,  capacity  for  storage,  and  demand-side  management \narrangements, etc. Given different research methodologies and different grid conditions, current \nstudies on the connectivity of wind differ substantially and are hard to compare. In general, a \npenetration rate of 10% or lower is considered to be relatively manageable; with a penetration \nrate of 15% or higher, the additional costs increase exponentially.10 Therefore, without a firm \nunderstanding of the effects of large-scale (i.e., more than 15%) wind penetration on system \nstability, grid companies will continue to be hesitant partners in integrating more wind power in \nthe grid. Some estimates showed that in 2009 about one-third of newly installed wind capacity in \nthe PRC could not be integrated into the grid in a timely manner due to perceived impacts on \ngrid stability. This has posed a risk as it not only precludes the development of renewable \nenergy but also locks the PRC into a coal-dependent energy mix for the future at an early stage.  \n \n5.  The  second  challenge  is  that  strategic  harmonization  between  renewable  energy \ndevelopment  and  grid  expansion  is  essential.  While  wind  farm  developers  are  greatly \nencouraged by strong incentives of higher tariff, the grid companies have been squeezed by the \nrising uploading tariff (both coal-fired and renewables) and the relatively stable selling price, and \nare  facing  difficulties  mobilizing  sufficient  funds  to  upgrade  transmission  and  distribution \nnetworks (e.g., rural subgrids) and accommodate more renewables (e.g., wind and solar). To \npromote  the  development  of  renewable  energy,  regulatory  and  policy  uncertainty  for  grid \ncompanies, who are responsible for network upgrading and development, has to be minimized. \nStandard procedures and codes to simplify the connectivity of renewable power plants with the \ngrid have to be streamlined and sound tariffs for renewables and incentive mechanisms for the \ngrid must be established.  \n \n6.  The third challenge is that the economics of long-distance transmission lines have to be \nworked out. Wind power is not evenly distributed geographically and seasonally, and availability \nof peak wind may not coincide with peak demand for electricity. Areas with rich wind resources \nare mainly located in north and northwest PRC, several thousand kilometers from load centers \nin the eastern part of the PRC. A vast amount of wind power has to be transmitted long \ndistances through ultra-high-voltage transmission lines. Also, northern PRC usually sees strong \nwind and peak demand for heat in winter. Prioritizing heat supply in winter means that wind \npower has to give way to coal-fired combined heat and power units. In some cases this leads to \nthe idling of wind turbines. There is an urgent need to have much greater integration and to \nbalance power supply and demand across a much wider area.   \n \n7.  The  existing  grid  infrastructure  in  the  PRC,  along  with  the  regulatory  and  policy \nframework, was developed for the fossil-fuel-based economy, and in the future the grid will need \nto accommodate a far more diverse energy mix with a much higher proportion of renewable \nenergy. This target will not be achieved without large-scale utilization of wind power. As the \nlevel of wind power generation increases, its intermittency will make it increasingly difficult for \nthe grid operator to balance supply and demand. Potential solutions include, first, wind power \n                                                 \n9  Wind penetration refers to the fraction of wind power capacity connected compared with the total available \ngeneration capacity in the grid. \n10 International Energy Agency. 2010. Wind Energy Annual Report 2009. Paris. \n ", "  3\nforecasting, i.e., making the intermittent wind more predictable. The purpose of forecasting is \nstraightforward\u2014if the grid operator has more accurate information on the day-ahead wind \npower generating capacity, then less extra spinning reserves are required. This will greatly \nreduce the total system operation costs, and grid operators will then be willing to integrate more \nwind farms in the system. A second solution is making demand flexible through the use of smart \nmetering. Currently most customers are not exposed to real-time pricing and do not generally \nhave  the  technical  means  to  respond  rapidly  to  price  changes.  Variations  in  demand  are \ntherefore met by ramping up or down the generators. This passive operation model can be \nchanged  if  smart  metering  enables  nonessential  appliances  to  be  switched  on  and  off \nautomatically  in  response  to  real-time  price  fluctuations.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to \ncomprehensively analyze these issues and help the PRC create a more enabling environment \nfor renewable energy development.  \n \n8.  A smart grid is a power grid that can intelligently manage demand and supply across the \nwhole electricity value chain\u2014generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption\u2014through \nrobust two-way communications. Smart grid deployment is widely believed to be a key for \nemploying renewable energy at large scale to reduce carbon intensity and address climate \nchange. The SGCC is responsible for managing more than 80% of the transmission system in \nthe PRC. It announced its smart grid development plan in mid-2009, aiming to establish by 2020 \na \u201cstrong and smart grid\u201d to improve the grid security, intelligent level of distribution, and \nintegration of renewable energy. The TA will directly address key challenges faced by SGCC \nsmart grid development plan. \n \n9.  Climate change is not only an environmental problem but also a critical development \nissue. Its adverse impacts will disproportionally affect the poor, as they are more reliant on their \ndirect natural environment. In its long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020),11 \nADB  has  identified  energy  as  a  core  operational  sector  and  achieving  environmental \nsustainability  as  a  strategic  priority  in  pursuing  its  mission  to  help  its  developing  member \ncountries  reduce  poverty  and  improve  living  conditions  and  quality  of  life.  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for energy operation in the PRC12 also emphasized clean and efficient \ntechnologies to promote the utilization of renewable energy and help reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. There is a strong and clear consistency between the strategic priorities of ADB and \nthe PRC in the energy sector.  \n \n10.  The TA is the first TA of ADB to promote smart grid technology in the PRC, and is a very \ngood fit with the SGCC\u2019s smart grid development plan. By comprehensively analyzing issues \nsurrounding poor grid integration of wind and other intermittent renewable energy sources, the \nTA  will  provide  key  enabling  conditions  for  larger  renewable  energy  utilization  and  can \naccelerate and intensify renewable energy development in the PRC. It is estimated that a \nsuccessful deployment of smart grid technology will help the PRC reduce its CO  emissions by \n2\n1.02 billion tons by 2020 compared to the 2005 level.13  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2008.

The impact of the TA will be increased utilization of renewable energy and reduced CO  \n2\nemissions in the PRC. The outcome of the TA will be improved capacity for grid integration of \nwind power plants in the SGCC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The proposed TA is designed to help the SGCC develop smart grid technology for \nefficient utilization of renewable energy. The outputs of the TA are as follows: (i) a smart grid \nroad map for harmonizing renewable energy development with the grid expansion in a regional \ngrid is developed; (ii) technical standards for the connectivity of renewable energy to the grid are \ncodified and upgraded; (iii) short-term day-ahead wind power forecasting systems are upgraded \nand piloted in a selected power dispatch center; and (iv) training activities are provided and \nlessons learned disseminated to other places and stakeholders, and a policy note on smart grid \ndevelopment is prepared for high-level governmental officials. \n \n13.  Close coordination will be maintained with stakeholders during implementation to ensure \nthat the TA takes into account existing studies, government priorities, plans, and results of pilot \ntests. Experts from research institutes and universities will be consulted so as to increase \nunderstanding of current practices and identify pragmatic methods for developing smart grid \ntechnology. Consultants will be required to examine international best practices which can be \nused in delivering the TA outputs. The consultants are required to maintain close working \nrelations with ADB and the executing agency and implementing agency. Tripartite meetings \namong ADB, the executing agency and implementing agency, and the consultants will be held \nperiodically to provide guidance to the consultants and to review their reports. Workshops and \nseminars will be held to collect comments on consultants\u2019 reports and also to disseminate the \nmain findings of the TA.  \n \n14.  The  TA  includes  innovative  ideas  and  approaches,  but  the  associated  risks  are \nconsidered manageable as the TA will be implemented in close cooperation with professional \ntechnical experts nominated by the executing agency and its focus is on a narrow policy area. \nThe major assumptions are that the smart grid road map and technical standards recommended \nby  ADB  consultants  are  accepted  and  implemented  by  the  grid  company.  Since  the  TA \naddresses an ongoing core issue of large unconnected wind power capacity and fits well with \nthe SGCC\u2019s target of setting up a smart grid by 2020, the SGCC has good ownership of the TA. \nTo ensure that the designed outputs can be delivered on time, the project team extensively \ndiscussed the TA outline and key outputs with experts, and support from the top management of \nthe SGCC was sought on the TA design.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,200,000 equivalent. It is proposed that \nADB provide $900,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund14 \nunder the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility administered by ADB. The government \nwill finance the remaining $300,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions including office \n                                                 \n14 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.  \n ", "  5\naccommodation, logistic facilities, and remuneration of counterpart staff. The TA cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The North China Grid Company has been designated as the executing agency, and \nproject management officers have been nominated by SGCC to guide the TA implementation on \na  day-to-day  basis.  The  TA  will  be  carried  out  by  a  team  of  consultants  with  extensive \nknowledge and expertise in (i) smart grid development and planning, (ii) grid operation and \npower dispatch, (iii) electrical and electronic engineering, (iv) meteorology, (v) wind power \nengineering, (vi) wind power forecasting, (vii) energy economics and policy analyses, (viii) \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards,  and  (ix)  institutional  capacity  building  and  public \ninformation sharing. The consulting work will comprise about 11 person-months of international \nconsultants and 50 person-months of national consultants. Similar expertise is required for both \ninternational and national consultants in the same area. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  ADB,  in  consultation  with  the  executing  agency  will  select  and  engage  consultants \nthrough a consulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, \nas amended from time to time) using the quality- (80%) and cost-based (20%) selection method. \nThe consulting firm will be required to submit a simplified technical proposal covering all aspects \nof the terms of reference. For output 2, a suitable software package will be purchased if possible, \nand upgraded as necessary to satisfy the needs of wind power forecasting. The wind power \nforecasting specialists and meteorologists are responsible for preparing specifications of the \nwind power forecasting software, and procure and evaluate the performance of the program. All \nsoftware  and  equipment  procurement  will  be  carried  out  using  the  shopping  method  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All \nequipment  purchased under  the TA  will  be turned  over  to  the  executing  agency  after  TA \ncompletion. \n \n18.  Training, seminars, conferences and workshops, and study tours will be administered \nthrough a consulting services contract. Consultants are expected to provide training materials, \nand  important  topics  will  be  highlighted  during  workshops  and  seminars.  Workshops  and \nseminars will be held to collect comments on consultants' reports and also to disseminate the \nmain findings of the TA. Consultants are required to summarize seminars, workshops, and \ntraining results and report to the executing agency and ADB. To facilitate TA implementation, an \nadvance payment facility is requested, and TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from April 2011 to September 2012. The \nconsultants are required to submit TA deliverables and progress reports in a timely manner. \nDetailed requirements for deliverables and reports are included in the outline terms of reference \nfor consultants.  \n \nIV.
