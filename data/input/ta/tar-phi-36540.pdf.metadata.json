INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2003 country programming mission, the Government of the Republic of the \nPhilippines requested the Asian Develoment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to prepare a \nmaster plan for the Agusan River Basin, following an integrated river basin management (IRBM) \napproach. The TA Fact-Finding Mission was fielded from 4 to 17 November 2004 to develop the \nproject concept. Agreements were reached on the objectives, scope of work, cost estimates and \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the consultants for the \nTA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update for the Philippines.1 The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Agusan River Basin, located in the northeastern part of Mindanao (map attached), is \nthe third largest river basin of the Philippines with a river length of 350 kilometers (km) and a \ntotal drainage area of 10,921 km2. The basin is divided into three subbasins on the basis of \ntopographic features: (i) lower Agusan River Basin, which is the area along the downstream \nreach from Amparo in Agusan del Norte Province; (ii) middle Agusan River Basin, which is the \narea along the reach between Amparo and Sta. Josefa in Agusan del Sur Province; and (iii) \nupper Agusan River Basin, which is the area along the upstream reach from Sta. Josefa in \nCompostela Valley Province. Currently, there are ongoing agricultural development and flood \ncontrol projects in the lower Agusan River including Butuan City. The Lower Agusan Irrigation \nDevelopment Project (7,922 hectares [ha]) together with the Flood Control Project (phase II) is \nbeing implemented with funding assistance from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. \n \n3.  A substantial part of the Agusan River Basin is composed of alluvial plain and river \nmouth delta. The lowlands, along the Agusan River, downstream from its confluence with the \nBanza River in the east bank and the Agusan Peque\u00f1o River in the west bank, consist of a vast \nmarshy flood-prone area. This marshy land in the middle reach of the Agusan River tends to \nretard water flow, thus causing this portion of the river to be the habitat of snails carrying \nschistosomiasis parasites. Appropriate river management is necessary to improve water flow \nand control the spread of the disease. Agusan Marsh covering a total area of 19,197 ha2 was \nproclaimed a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1996. The marsh serves as a flood retention basin for the \nAgusan River  to cut the peak discharge of  flash floods to downstream towns. The marsh \nharbors unique and pristine habitats like the sago and peat swamp forests. It is also the habitat \nof  rare  and  endangered  fauna.  A  comprehensive  impact  assessment  of  the  marsh  and \nformulation of a plan for the area are necessary to develop the middle Agusan River Basin. An \nimpact assessment of the marsh is required to formulate the Agusan River Basin\u2019s development \nplan. \n \n4.  The Agusan River, which could be tapped for its abundant water resources, is not being \nfully utilized to generate economic growth and development. Water supply is insufficient in the \ndry season and, sometimes, prolonged drought brings about damage to agricultural production. \nDuring the wet season, recurrent overflow of the river brings serious and enormous damage to \nlives,  properties,  and  agricultural  crops  as  well  as  to  infrastructure  facilities  that  support \nagricultural activities. To date, no integrated basin development plan has been formulated for \nthe Agusan River Basin.  Regional development plans prepared by the National Economic and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 17 November 2004. \n2  The Agusan Marsh is located within the political jurisdiction of Veruela, Loreto, Bunawan, La Paz, Rosario, and San \nFrancisco municipalities of Agusan del Sur Province. ", "2 \nDevelopment  Authority  (NEDA),  and the  CARAGA  Region,  do  not  address  the  issue  of \ncoordination among provincial governments along the Agusan River, or multiple uses of water \nresources. This issue is important to avoid conflict of interests in water allocation and resource \ntransfer  from  downstream  to  upstream  communities.  Provincial  development  plans  in  the \nupstream provinces (Compostela Valley and Agusan del Sur) did not  prioritize watershed \nmanagement.  \n \n5.  Watersheds in the basin are heavily degraded.  Irrigation systems deteriorate rapidly \nbecause of heavy siltation in the facilities and lack of an operation and maintenance budget. \nThe rapid denudation of the watershed area by illegal logging, slash-and-burn agriculture, and \nforest fires are the major causes of water shortage affecting the irrigation system. Watersheds \nhave  to  be  restored  to  secure  water  resources  continuously  and  to  achieve  sustainable \nagricultural development. The denudation of  the watershed  area  is  one  of  the  causes  of \nfrequent floods in the downstream area of the Agusan River.  \n \n6.   The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) identified several proposals for irrigation \ndevelopment in the Middle Agusan River Basin; however these proposals were prepared more \nthan 7 years ago and only at reconnaissance level. The ongoing and newly proposed projects \nwere designed as individual projects, and neglected the benefits of multipurpose and integrated \nwater resources development and management. It is important to prepare a comprehensive \nstrategic plan for sustainable development of the Agusan River Basin to optimize the use of its \nresources and facilitate sustainable management and development. \n \n7.  Mining operations in Compostela Valley are widespread. Operations of these mines do \nnot follow  sound environmental management; an estimated 360,000 tons of mine tailings  is \ndischarged annually into the Agusan River through the Naboc River. Mining operations in Mount \nDiwata  use  mercury,  cyanide,  and  explosives,  which  have serious  direct  effects  on the \nenvironment as well as on farmers and residents of the Monkayo area, and indirect effects on \nthe population living within the basin.  \n \n8.  Most lessons learned and highlighted in ADB's water policy3, are relevant in preparing a \nmaster plan for the Agusan River Basin. The principal lesson learned from investment in the \nwater sector, and from a review of the sector\u2019s current context in the developing member \ncountries (DMCs), is that ADB and its DMCs need to move rapidly from an era of disaggregated \nwater sector investments aimed primarily at creating assets to an era of holistic, integrated \ninvestments to promote efficient water use. Investment in water supply and sanitation, irrigation \nand drainage, hydropower, flood control, and watershed management should be set in the \ncontext of managing water resources within river basins.  \n \n9.  Currently, coordination among river basin stakeholders in the Agusan River Basin is very \nweak.  To  meet  the  increasing  challenges  of  water  scarcity,  pollution,  and  degradation  of \nwatersheds and ecosystems, water and related resources need to be managed in an integrated \nmanner. Integrated water resources management (IWRM) is a process to improve the planning, \nconservation, development, and management of water, forest, land, and aquatic resources in a \nriver basin context. Such an approach will maximize economic benefits and social welfare in an \nequitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital environment systems. \n \n10.  To implement IWRM, the establishment of river basin organizations (both formal and \ninformal) will facilitate stakeholder consultation and participation, and help improve planning, \n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. ", "    3 \ninformation gathering, monitoring, and advisory services to local and national authorities. Basin \norganizations will help prepare and maintain basin profiles with information on water demand \nand uses, and approved planning directions and standards. Community involvement in resource \nmonitoring and management should be organized on a river basin basis. \n \n11.  Under the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA), the Government intends \nto  implement  specific  principles  and  guidelines  for  irrigation  and  watershed  development, \nproviding for economic cost recovery, devolution of communal systems to local government \nunits, and promotion of private sector-led development of minor systems. However, funding \nshortages have greatly constrained implementation of the AFMA. Similarly, limited national \nbudget allocations for operation and maintenance of national irrigation systems, and NIA's \ninability to increase contributions from water users have led to a deterioration in irrigation \nsystem efficiencies. NIA also suffers from financial, organizational, and staffing constraints. \n \n12.  The  devolution  of  authority  needs  to  be  complemented  by  capacity  building  at \ncommunity level so that poor people, who often lack skills and organizational structure, are able \nto effectively  carry out their new responsibilities. All water sector interventions must include \nsufficient time and financial resources to enable direct stakeholders to organize and to voice \ntheir opinion. A master plan for the Agusan River Basin has to be cognizant of the multiple uses \nof its resources, needs of the direct and indirect stakeholders, capacities and institutional \nframework  for  managing  and  developing  the  large  basin  area,  and  financial  and  human \nresources required for a holistic approach to basin management. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The TA will help the Government prepare a master plan for the Agusan River Basin in \nMindanao through an IRBM approach with the participation of all stakeholders, including civil \nsociety, the private sector, the local government units (LGUs), and the national Government. \nThe goal of the master plan is to map out a development strategy that, once implemented, will \npromote optimal development of resources and reduce poverty in the Agusan River Basin. \n \n14.  The TA will help the Government (i) hold extensive consultations with stakeholders in the \nAgusan River Basin, (ii) formulate a plan to strengthen IRBM capability in relevant government \norganizations  as  well  as  people  in  communities,  and  (iii)  identify  appropriate institutional \narrangements for managing the basin. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will collect relevant statistical data relating to climatic, hydrologic, geographic, \nhydrogeological, environmental, and socioeconomic conditions in the basin; and review the \nexisting policies and strategies in water-related sectors. It will review the role and sustainability \nof a river basin organization, resources transfer mechanisms between downstream residents \nand upstream poor people living in the watershed areas, and participatory approaches for \nformulation of a master plan for the whole river basin.  \n \n16.  After identifying stakeholders in the Agusan River Basin, intensive consultation meetings \nwith stakeholders in the downstream, midstream and upstream areas will be conducted to \nidentify their needs and resolve conflict of interests, determine approaches to develop the river \nbasin in the future while protecting environmentally sensitive areas. ", "4 \n \n17.  The consultant team will assess the role of the existing basin organizations, such as \nLaguna Lake Development Authority and Agno River Basin Commission,4 with analysis of the \nissues on sustainability of inactive organizations, such as Cagayan River Basin Commission \nand Bicol River Basin Commission. \n \n18.  The TA will then firm up the development strategy for the Agusan River Basin, taking \ninto consideration the outcome of the stakeholder consultations. At the end of phase  1, a \nworkshop will  be held  for representatives from  the Department of Environment and Natural \nResources  (DENR),  National  Water  Resources  Board  (NWRB), Department  of  Agriculture \n(DA)/NIA,  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways  (DPWH),  and  four  provincial \ngovernments,5 Butuan City government, nongovernment organizations, and other stakeholders \nto discuss the basin development strategy as well as the consultant team\u2019s interim report. The \ndevelopment strategy will be discussed at the tripartite meeting among representatives from the \nGovernment, the consultant team, and ADB. \n \n19.  In phase 2, a master plan for the Agusan River Basin will be prepared based on the \ndevelopment  strategy  agreed  upon  at  the  end  of  phase  1.  The  master  plan  will  identify \nmeasures for strengthening the capability for  IRBM, and assess the necessity for the Agusan \nRiver Basin Commission.  The master plan will include the prioritized list of potential projects in \nirrigation,  watershed  restoration  and  management,  environmental  protection,  hydropower, \ndomestic and industrial water supply and other sectors, with preliminary cost estimates of each \nproject. The master plan will be presented and discussed in a final workshop, and will be used \nby the Government and ADB and other development partners to inform  future development \nactivities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total TA cost is estimated at $1,390,000 equivalent, of which $490,000 is in foreign \nexchange cost and $900,000 is in local currency cost. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance $970,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $480,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from ADB's TA \nfunding program.  The  Government  will  assume the balance of the local currency cost of \n$420,000 equivalent  by providing experienced counterpart staff, appropriate office space in \nManila and Butuan  City,  data,  administrative  and  clerical  services,  and  communications. \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be DENR in association with NWRB. A TA steering \ncommittee (TASC) will be established in Manila to review the progress and outputs of the TA. \nThe TASC will be chaired by a senior officer in DENR, and cochaired by a senior official of \nNWRB. The members of TASC will  be senior representatives from NEDA, DA/NIA, DPWH, \nNational Commission on Indigenous People (NCIP), and representatives of the four provincial \ngovernments involved. 5 A technical working group, chaired by the regional director of DENR,6 \nand comprising staff from NEDA regional office, DA/NIA regional office, NCIP regional office, \nrepresentatives  from  four  provincial  governments,5  and  Butuan  City  government,  will  be \n                                                 \n4  The Agno River Basin Commission was recently abolished by the President's Office. \n5  Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Sur, and Compostela Valley. \n6  Including staff from Environmental Monitoring Bureau and Mines and Geoscience Bureau.  ", "    5 \nestablished in Butuan  City for close monitoring of the consulting services and to discuss \ntechnical issues. DENR has therefore agreed to immediately nominate a project officer with the \nrank of directorate head in DENR/NWRB, who will be the point of contact between DENR and \nADB and ultimately responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the TA. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over  1 year in two phases of 4 and 8  months starting \nFebruary 2005. A consultant team will be stationed in Butuan City, the largest city in the basin, \nlocated at the mouth of the Agusan River.  International consultants (17 person-months) and \ndomestic consultants (58 person-months), for a total of 75 person-months will be engaged \nthrough an international consulting firm. The team leader, an international consultant, will work \nfull-time in the Philippines for the duration of the TA study except for 1 month between phase 1 \nand phase 2. Expertise will be required in  IRBM, river basin planning, hydrology, hydraulic \nstructure engineering, irrigation, sociology, watershed management, institutional development, \nenvironment, economics, and database and/or geographic information system.  The consultants \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the cost-\nbased selection method and simplified technical proposals. The consultants will begin fieldwork \nin June 2005 and will complete it in May 2006. Outline terms of reference for the consulting \nservices are in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  a  fully  participatory  manner,  involving  extensive \nconsultations with local governments and communities in the basin.  Representatives of the \nstakeholders, including gender-balanced communities, will be invited to the workshops to be \nheld at the end of the first and the second phases.  Five stakeholders active in the planning \nprocess will be invited to participate in a study trip abroad to observe best river management \npractices. They will be required to produce as a team a study report on the best practices \nstudied. The Brisbane river basin was identified as a potential relevant basin for study. \n \n24.  The consultants will submit four reports and papers for workshops. The inception report, \nto be submitted within 1 month of the start of the TA, will summarize the initial findings and \npresent an updated work plan. The interim report, to be submitted 1 week before the end of \nphase 1, will describe the findings and recommendations of the first phase, and will be reviewed \nby the TASC and by a tripartite meeting of DENR, the consultants, and ADB. The draft final \nreport will be submitted 2 weeks before the end of phase 2, and will be discussed at a tripartite \nmeeting and  a second workshop. The final report will be  submitted 2 weeks after the final \ntripartite  meeting.  All  reports  will  be  prepared  in  English.  Equipment  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $970,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for a Master Plan for the Agusan River Basin, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \nSustainable use of  Gross domestic product in  National and local \nAgusan River Basin  the river basin higher than  government statistics \nresources to reduce  the national average with   \npoverty  the execution of the  Annual socioeconomic \n  master plan  reports at provincial and \n    district levels \n  Reduced incidence of   \n  floods and drought in the  Provincial socioeconomic \n  basin with the execution of  survey \n  the master plan   \n    Local government tax \n  Percentage of population  revenues \n  below the poverty line   \n  decreased from 60.7% to \n  below 50% with the \n  execution of the master \nplan \n \nPurpose  A.
