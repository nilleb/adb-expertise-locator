The  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  to  improve  debt \nmanagement capacity of the West Java provincial government.1 The government requested the \nTA through dialogue among the Directorate General of Fiscal Balance (DGFB) of the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), the West Java provincial government, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe concept paper for the TA was approved on 28 April 2014. The provincial government and \nDGFB of MOF have indicated concurrence with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference as outlined in this report. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Decentralization  and  increased  subnational  government  responsibility  over \ninfrastructure.  ADB  has  identified  the  lack  of  infrastructure  as  a  severe  constraint  in  the \ndevelopment of Indonesia\u2019s economy.2 The government has also expressed the same view and \nhas estimated investment needs for infrastructure between 2010 to 2014 at approximately $214 \nbillion. Since the central government decentralized authority to the second tier of government \nlevel (also known as \u201cbig bang\u201d decentralization reforms) in 2001, approximately 33% of total \npublic  expenditure,  up from  7%  in  2000,  has been  delegated to  subnational  governments \n(SNGs), defined as provincial, district, and municipal governments.3 The reforms launched in \n2001  involved  a  massive  delegation  of  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  public  services, \nincluding the reassignment to SNGs of two-thirds of civil servants and more than 16,000 service \ndelivery facilities. Indonesia\u2019s long-term decentralization policy objectives include improving the \ndelivery of basic services and infrastructure to local communities across the country. Under \nIndonesia\u2019s decentralized governance structure, the provision of infrastructure has increasingly \nbecome the responsibility of SNG bodies. Yet local public service delivery has been poor, \nnegatively impacting the local business environment. With low quality of infrastructure, local \nbusiness activities have not reached their optimal level. \n \n3.  Lack  of  funding  for  infrastructure  development.  SNGs  are  now  responsible  for \nmanaging their own fiscal and development affairs. The quality of their management over public \ninvestments, including the infrastructure sectors, corresponds to the quality of basic service \ndelivery to their constituents. Yet the result remains disappointing. When capital investment \nneeds  are  taken  into  account,  SNGs  have  insufficient  financial  resources  to  meet  their \ninvestment needs, which far exceed their revenues and surpluses. Despite decentralization, \nmost  funding  is  still  derived  from  government  transfers  in  the  form  of  grants,  with  little \nmobilization among SNGs. Currently, the largest unconditional grant available to SNGs is the \ngeneral allocation fund, which, on average, accounts for 50% of total SNG revenues. SNG \nshare of revenues from extractive industries (dana bagi hasil) represents 17% of their revenues, \nand an additional 7% is accounted for by the infrastructure development grant under the specific \nallocation fund. Total grants to SNGs increased from an estimated Rp150 trillion in 2005 to \naround  Rp350  trillion  in  2010.  Local  revenue,  from  limited  taxes  and  charges,  represents \napproximately  16%  of total  SNG  revenue.  In addition  to  these revenues, more  SNGs  are \nborrowing money from the government to finance their capital investments. The government \nloans to SNGs are given through either subsidiary loan agreements or through the regional \n                                                           \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \non 2 July 2014. \n2  H. Hill, M. E. Khan, and, J. Zhuong, eds. 2012. Diagnosing the Indonesian Economy: Toward Inclusive and Green \nGrowth. London: Asian Development Bank/Anthem Press. \n3  Law No. 32 of 2004 regarding Regional Administration, Art. 2(1). \n ", "2 \n \ndevelopment  account.  The  loans  made  through  these  mechanisms,  particularly  the  loan \nagreements, have often been driven by central ministries managing donor-financed projects that \nwere conceived and designed to respond to central rather than local concerns. The regional \ndevelopment  accounts  and  subsidiary  loan  agreements  have  been  managed  primarily  as \ngovernment  programs,  with  the  result  that  SNGs  tend  to  view  the  government  as  having \nownership over projects funded through these mechanisms. \n \n4.  New sources of funding are needed. To increase capital investment over time, SNGs \nwill need to have access to various sources of funding beyond intergovernmental transfers and \nSNG source revenues. There is therefore a need for more private participation in mobilizing \nlarge-scale infrastructure funding. Indeed, limited fiscal space has led the government to look for \nmore private participation in infrastructure projects. Subnational bonds are seen as one way to \nencourage more private participation. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to develop \nan appropriate SNG borrowing and debt management regulatory framework, in particular to \nfacilitate the creation of municipal capital markets and to encourage the active participation of \nSNGs in these markets by building their  public financial management (PFM) capacity and \ncreditworthiness. The government has allowed SNGs to issue local bonds since 2004.4 The aim \nis for SNGs to finance those public investments that have multiplier effects rather than their local \noperating budget deficits. The law is based on international best practices that emphasize fiscal \ncapacity. Criteria that are based on institutional requirements and financial viability strive to \nensure that no weak and debt-ridden SNGs are able to issue subnational bonds. The two \ninstitutional requirements are that (i) the SNG must obtain an unqualified or qualified opinion \nfrom the Supreme Audit Board, and (ii) there must be a functioning \u201cdebt management unit\u201d \nwithin their PFM structure.5 The two financial criteria are that (i) the SNG\u2019s aggregate debt \nservice coverage ratio is not more than 2.5, and (ii) the accumulated debt of the SNG is no more \nthan  75%  of  the  previous  year\u2019s  revenue.  These  criteria  are  intended  to  avoid  SNGs \noverextending  themselves  (i.e.,  overburdening  themselves  with  debt  and  projects)  in  an \nenvironment where their financial management quality is generally weak. \n \n5.  Problems  precluding the  issuance  of  subnational  bonds.  Despite the advent of \nsubnational bond regulations in Indonesia a decade ago, there has not been a single bond \nissuance to date. The primary reasons for this are (i) Indonesia\u2019s widespread and relatively \nshallow capital market, (ii) the lack of PFM capacity at the SNG level, and (iii) the accompanying \nlow creditworthiness of SNGs. For example, the average size of the local currency bond market \nin Indonesia from 2009 to 2013 was 14.8% of gross domestic product as compared to 96.0% in \nMalaysia and 68.9% in Thailand. The shallow capital market can have an impact on the price \ndiscovery for subnational bond, and thus making it more expensive. In addition, the lack of PFM \nand debt management skills at the local level has contributed to reluctance among private \nlenders to make unsecured loans to SNGs. This weakens the credit culture among SNGs: \ndefaults  on  loans  by  SNGs  appear  to  be  due  more  to  an  unwillingness\u2014rather  than  an \ninability\u2014to repay. This is evident from the large number of local water supply companies in \narrears even though SNGs continue to accumulate cash reserves. It appears that SNGs tend to \nview loans received by the government as \u201cgrants\u201d rather than debts. Another point within the \nambit of decentralized PFM is the ability of SNGs to prioritize their investment needs. Given that \nsubnational bonds in Indonesia are required to be linked to a project, it is pertinent for SNGs to \nbe able to select viable projects to be funded by their bonds. 6 \n                                                           \n4 Law No. 33 of 2004 regarding Fiscal Balance between Central and Local Government, Art. 57. \n5 Supreme Audit Board\u2019s classification of audit opinions, from strongest to weakest are as follows: (1) Unqualified \n(clean without exceptions) opinion, (2) Qualified (Clean with exceptions) opinion, (3) Adverse opinion, and (4) \nDisclaimer opinion. \n6 Government Regulation 30 of 2011 regarding Regional Loans, Art. 14. \n ", "3 \n \n6.  West Java provincial government as the target. The focus on West Java is based on \nfour factors:  \n \n(i)  Previous ADB assistance has provided a shadow rating for West Java, which \nwas \u2013AA, or three notches below the rating of the central government\u2019s treasury. \nThe rating revealed that West Java\u2019s strong cash reserve position and robust \neconomic growth have contributed to the province\u2019s good performance rating. \n(ii)  West Java is the third largest regional economy in Indonesia, and the West Java \nPlanning Agency estimated that the provincial government needs at least $31 \nbillion  to  finance  its  capital  development  expenditure  over  the  next  three \ndecades.  Attracting  more  private  investment  requires  commitment  from  the \nprovincial government to continue to address PFM. The provincial government \nhas already implemented measures to improve its governance rating, including \ninstalling a regional financial management system (with the help of ADB) and \nimproving its ranking on the Performance Evaluation of Regional Governments \nfrom 15 out of 33 in 2009 to 8 in 2012.7 This improvement was also recognized \nby  the  Supreme  Audit  Board  when  it  awarded  the  provincial  government\u2019s \nfinancial statement with an unqualified opinion.  \n(iii)  The West Java provincial government is committed to issuing a bond, and a \ngovernor\u2019s decree was issued in October 2011 that establishes a formal team. \nThis team has met national and subnational stakeholders, and a timeline on the \nbond  issuance  has  been  produced.  From  MOF\u2019s  standpoint,  the  province\u2019s \nachievement of an unqualified opinion from the Supreme Audit Board provides a \nclear path for the issuance of a subnational bond, which is expected to occur by \nSeptember 2015. \n(iv)  The West Java International Airport, the project that the bond will finance, is also \nlisted in the Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia\u2019s Economic \nDevelopment, 2011\u20132025. \n \n7.  Synergy with other ADB, government, and development partner programs. The \ngovernment has been taking steps to address the problems discussed above through improved \nregulations on SNG bond issuance, training, streamlining, budgeting and planning procedures, \nimproved  grant  systems,  more  comprehensive  and  timely  reporting  and  auditing,  the \ndevelopment of a credit culture, and the deepening of bond markets. ADB has been assisting \nthe government in some of these efforts. ADB\u2019s main engagement has been through a series of \nloans and TA for the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Sector Development \nProgram.8 The program was designed to enable more effective local government public services \nthrough an improved fiscal, budgetary, and financial management framework. The program \nidentified key PFM issues in SNGs, including the protracted and complex local budget cycle, \nmisalignment  between  planning  and  budgeting,  lack  of  qualified  staff,  poor  PFM  skills, \ninconsistent  accounting  standards,  and  the  absence  of  solid  debt  monitoring  and  debt \nmanagement. In addition to the program, the proposed TA supplements other ADB capacity \n                                                           \n7  Performance Evaluation of Regional Government (or Evaluasi Kinerja Penyelenggaraan Pemerintahan Daerah) is \na performance index on that is created by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The purpose of the index is to rank the \neffectiveness of local governments in carrying their mandates. The higher the ranking, the more effective the local \ngovernment.  \n8  ADB. 2003.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be a more conducive environment for subnational bonds in Indonesia \nbased on West Java as a role model for other SNGs. The outcome will be a well functioning \ndebt management unit in West Java. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.   The proposed TA will involve working with the West Java provincial government to \nimprove its capacity in planning for capital investments, project selection, and improved financial \nmanagement capacity. These are critical for building up West Java\u2019s debt management capacity \nahead of a bond issuance in 2016. The proposed TA will also focus on working with the \nFinancial Services Authority and Bank Indonesia to fine-tune the existing regulation on SNG \nbonds to create a more conducive regulatory environment. \n \n10.  Output  1:  Debt  and  financial  management  capacity  of  West  Java  Provincial \nGovernment assessed and improved. The support will help the West Java government to \nlearn how capital markets perceive its creditworthiness by providing a shadow credit rating and \nassessing its financial management practices through a comparison of its performance to peer \ncities. Assistance will be provided to improve West Java\u2019s debt and financial management \npractices by providing capacity building and follow-up assessment to improve its capacity in the \nareas that need strengthening based on the initial assessment. Financial management capacity \nis critical for the viability of the intended bond issuance and the SNG bond market more broadly. \nThe assistance is needed to ensure that a functioning debt management unit is achieved before \nthe bond issuance.11 \n \n11.  Output 2: Local regulations on the establishment of debt management unit and \nmunicipal  bond  in  West  Java  are  introduced.  Assistance  in  the  form  of  drafting  the \nregulations will be provided to the West Java provincial government in establishing a debt \nmanagement unit as a step towards the issuance of a subnational bond. The regulation will be \nthe main local regulatory framework in the establishment of a functioning debt management unit \nin West Java.  \n \n12.  Output 3: Capacity of West Java government in project selection increased. The \nTA aims to improve the efficiency of investment process, such as project selection, in West \nJava. The efficiency in investment is central  in improving West Java\u2019s capacity  on capital \n                                                           \n9  ADB. 2012.

Best investment process will be disseminated to other local governments \nthrough DGFB, as the central government figure. Best investment process, such as prudent \nproject selection, also lowers the risk premium faced by subnational bond holders. \n \n13.  Output 4: Policy notes on capital market regulation supporting subnational bond \nissuance produced. While the government has allowed SNGs to issue local bonds since 2004, \nwork remains to be done to ensure that the regulatory framework for SNG borrowing and debt \nmanagement  is  appropriate  and  effective.  Based  on  the  findings  and  experiences  of  the \npreceding outputs under the proposed TA, policy notes will be provided to MOF, Financial \nServices  Authority,  and  Bank  Indonesia  as  inputs  to  fine-tune  the  existing  regulation  on \nsubnational bonds. The activities that will be undertaken are (i) promoting subnational bonds as \none  of  the  public  securities  so  that  they  become  admissible  for  statutory  liquidity  ratio \ninvestment by commercial banks, (ii) improving the existing regulation on subnational bonds on \npublic disclosure and public investment guidelines, and (iii) conducting a shadow subnational \nbond issuance to reveal the areas which need refinement. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $441,000, of which $420,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund.12  The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, review of outputs, office space, \nworkshop and consultation support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.   The executing agency will be DGFB of MOF and the implementing agency will be the \nCoordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs and West Java provincial government. \n \n16.  The TA will require four international person-months and 19 national person-months of \nconsulting services over an implementation period from 1 October 2014 to 31 April 2016. The \nconsultants will be a mix of individuals and firms selected through fixed-budget selection using a \nbio-data technical proposal. The fixed-budget selection will be used as the term of reference \nand will be precisely defined with no changes expected during implementation. The time and \npersonal inputs will be assessed accurately, and the budget is fixed and cannot be exceeded. \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursement will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $420,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for Strengthening the Local Government Bond Market, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                           \n12 Established by ADB.
