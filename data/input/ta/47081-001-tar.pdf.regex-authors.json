INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Strategic Framework for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nProgram,  2011\u20132020  (CAREC  2020)  has  two  strategic  objectives:  expanding  trade  and \nimproving industrial competitiveness.1 Within CAREC 2020, trade facilitation is one of four \npriority sectors. Work in this area was guided by the Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy \n(TTFS), approved in 2007 by the 6th CAREC Ministerial Conference. The TTFS has undergone \na midterm review during 2012\u20132013 to optimize its implementation for the remaining period \n(2014\u20132020). As a result, a Refined TTFS 2020 and Implementation Action Plan has been \ndeveloped and approved in 2013 by the 12th CAREC Ministerial Conference on 23\u201324 October \nin Astana, Kazakhstan. The refined strategy strengthens an integrated approach, focusing on \nthe  development  of  six  CAREC  corridors  through  infrastructure  investments  and  trade \nfacilitation initiatives to improve the movement of goods and people through and across these \ncorridors.  \n \n2.  Customs cooperation has been at the core of the trade facilitation program of CAREC \nsince its establishment in 2001, with the Customs Cooperation Committee (CCC) serving as a \nregional forum to discuss issues of common interest. The CCC is composed of heads of \ncustoms administrations of the 10 CAREC countries.  \n \n3.  The CCC defined five priority areas on which to focus its work: (i) simplification and \nharmonization of customs procedures and documentation, (ii) information and communication \ntechnology (ICT) for customs modernization and data exchange, (iii) risk management and post-\nentry audit, (iv) joint customs control (JCC), and (v) regional transit development. These five \npriority areas are fully consistent with the 10 building blocks for customs in the 21st century as \npromoted  by  the  World  Customs  Organization  (WCO).  The  proposed  regional  technical \nassistance (TA) will provide support in three of the five CCC priority areas:2 the simplification \nand harmonization of customs procedures and documentation, ICT for customs modernization, \nand data exchange and risk management techniques.3 \n \n4.  The proposed TA was discussed during the 12th CCC meeting on 18 September 2013 in \nAstana, Kazakhstan. Members of the CCC agreed that the regional TA reflects the objectives of \nthe identified priority areas, to which they gave their full support. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  CAREC countries have made important progress in customs modernization and trade \nfacilitation consistent with the identified five priority areas. Achievements to date in CAREC \ncustoms cooperation include:  \n(i)  accession to the Revised Kyoto Convention (RKC) by five countries;  \n(ii)  automation  of  customs  functions  with  the  aid  of  ICT,  simplification  and \nharmonization  of  customs  procedures;  and  application  of  risk  management \nprocedures; \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2012. CAREC 2020: A Strategic Framework for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, 2011\u2013\n2020. Manila. \n2  Priority (iv) on joint customs control will be supported by TA \u2018Coordinated Border Management for Results\u201d while \npriority (v) on regional transit development will be supported by TA \u201cFacilitation of Regional Transit Trade in Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC)\u201d. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 October 2013. \n ", "2  \n(iii)  pilot-testing of JCC in 2 pairs of countries through adoption of a unified cargo \nmanifest and the gradual move toward mutual recognition of inspection results, \n(iv)  accession to the TIR Convention in 8 countries for regional transit, and  \n(v)  capacity  building  programs  for  customs  officials  and  training  of  trainers  for \ncustoms training institutes in the region. \n \n6.  While much has been achieved in the five priority areas, countries still are confronted \nwith excessive transaction costs and delays. Central Asian countries face comparatively longer \ntime  frames  to  export  and  import  as  well  as  relatively  high  number  of  documentation \nrequirements. Exporters can expect to spend an average of 26 days to complete all export \nformalities \u2013 16 days more than the average in OECD economies4. A more focused and \ncoordinated approach is needed across all CCC members to align customs-related measures \nand procedures with international best practices. To avoid fragmented actions by individual \ncountries  and  promote  a  harmonized  approach  toward  reforms  in  CAREC  countries, \ninternational best practices must be further applied. \n \n7.  The simplification and harmonization of customs procedures relies heavily on the legal \nframework that regulates customs operations in each of the 10 countries. All the CAREC \ncountries are members of WCO and almost all have amended their laws to conform to the \nInternational Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures, or \nRevised Kyoto Convention (RKC).5 Five countries have acceded to the RKC (Azerbaijan, the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Kazakhstan,  Mongolia,  and  Pakistan)  and  the  remaining  five \n(Afghanistan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) are in the process of \naccession. At the 9th CCC meeting in Tokyo in 2010, the target was set to have the remaining \nfive countries accede to the RKC by 2015. \n \n8.  Another CCC priority area that requires immediate attention is the upgrading of risk \nmanagement techniques used by CAREC customs authorities as the means to achieve a \nbalanced approach to facilitation and control. Most customs authorities in CAREC have initiated \nefforts to introduce risk management in their clearance procedures, but much more needs to be \ndone to wean them away from 100% control procedures. Providing customs with the necessary \nsupport to lead efforts in integrating risk management systems of all border regulatory agencies \nis essential. Also, a disciplined and structured approach to managing risk by CAREC customs is \nneeded, which will allow the formulation of new initiatives whereby low-risk traders are permitted \nto operate under less stringent regulatory requirements. \n \n9.  Application of ICT for customs modernization and data exchange is also a priority for \nCCC members. Many customs administrations in CAREC countries use varying degrees of \nautomation  to  support  core  customs  functions  and  augment  risk  management  techniques. \nHowever, CAREC lacks an information exchange mechanism to enable electronic exchange of \ndata between customs administrations to promote real-time collaboration. \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The proposed TA will promote a concerted approach to customs reforms in CAREC \ncountries by applying international best practices. The TA will support accession to and improve \n                                                 \n4  Doing Business Report 2013. \n5  The  convention\u2019s  full  title  is  International  Convention  on  the  Simplification  and  Harmonization  of  Customs \nProcedures. The original convention was concluded in Kyoto in 1973 and entered into force in September 1974. It \nwas reviewed over a period of years and was ultimately amended in 1999. The convention is commonly referred to \nas the Revised Kyoto Convention.  \n ", "  3\ncompliance with the RKC. Risk management systems will be strengthened and options will be \nexplored for data exchange and information sharing between and among CAREC customs \nadministrations.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced trade facilitation regimes in CAREC countries that \nwill increase international trade flows so as to further integrate CAREC countries into the world \ntrading community. The outcome of the TA will be simplified and harmonized customs clearance \nprocedures that align customs trade facilitation measures with international best practices. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the delivery of the following \noutputs and activities: \n \n(i)  Actions  plans  to  align  customs  procedures  with  Revised  Kyoto \nConvention. The RKC provides a foundation for modern and efficient customs \nprocedures and is therefore central to customs modernization and reforms. The \nadoption and implementation of the convention by CAREC economies will deliver \ntangible  benefits  to  the  region  by  increasing  transparency  and  efficiency  in \ncustoms administration, while helping reduce transaction costs and boost trade \nsecurity. By increasing consistency and alignment of national legislations with the \nRKC, customs will be able to process imports and exports more smoothly. Five \nCAREC countries are in the process of accession (para. 6) and need assistance \nto complete their accession action plans. WCO has developed a self-assessment \ntool to help guide countries through a series of logical steps that will enable them \nto prepare for accession. Capacity-building workshops and training units will be \ndelivered to the 10 CAREC countries to develop an understanding of what is \nrequired to comply with and accede to the RKC, and to train personnel on the \nuse of the WCO self-assessment tool. Special follow-up support will be given to \nthe five countries pending accession to guide them in preparing an accession \naction  plan.  Support  will  be  provided  to  undertake  a  situation  analysis  by \ncomparing provisions of the RKC with existing national legislations. This will \nhighlight the provisions that countries already comply with, and those that need \ncompliance. A gap analysis will follow to identify the legislative and procedural \namendments that need to be done. Finally, an accession action plan for each \ncountry will be put in place. \n(ii)  Proposals for the modernization of risk management systems. Sound risk \nmanagement  is  fundamental  to  effective  customs  operations.  Drawing  on \nintelligence,  information,  and  experience,  customs  administrations  adopt \nprocedures designed to detect illegal activity in an effort to reduce its risks. By \nincreasing efficiency of risk management operations and streamlining processes \nand procedures, interventions in trade transactions will be minimized, thereby \nreducing  the  regulatory  burden  on  the  commercial  sector.  Eventually,  an \nauthorized economic operator (AEO)6 program for CAREC countries may be \n                                                 \n6  The authorized economic operator (AEO) is a party involved in the international movement of goods in whatever \nfunction has been approved by or on behalf of a national customs administration as complying with WCO or \nequivalent supply chain security standards. AEOs may include manufacturers, importers, exporters, brokers, \ncarriers,  consolidators,  intermediaries,  ports,  airports,  terminal  operators,  integrated  operators,  warehouses, \ndistributors, and freight forwarders. \n ", "4  \nintroduced. The WCO developed the WCO SAFE package which includes all the \nguidelines and instruments that support implementation of the SAFE framework.7 \nThe SAFE package includes tools to assist in establishing and administering \nAEO  programs.  Support  will  be  provided  to  countries  to  put  together  a  risk \nmanagement  program  to  expedite  clearance  of  legitimate  shipments  while \nmaintaining appropriate border control by identifying high-risk cargo. This will \nallow the establishment of a fast-track program in which approved and authorized \ntraders  with  good  compliance  records  can  obtain  the  release  of  cargo  with \nminimum  customs  intervention.  Using  the  WCO  Customs  Risk  Management \nCompendium as the common methodology to detect and treat potential risk, a \nreview and assessment of the risk management practices will be developed in \nselect countries. The assessment will also evaluate the readiness to embrace \nand introduce an AEO program. A set of recommendations and practical tools \nthat can aid implementation of risk management will be drafted. Workshops on \nthe WCO Risk Management Compendium will be organized to raise awareness \nand understanding of the methodology. In select countries, the concept of AEO \nwill be introduced using the WCO SAFE framework package. To raise awareness \nand understanding of AEO, workshops and consultations between customs and \ntraders will be organized. \n(iii)  Framework  for  a  CAREC  customs  information  exchange  mechanism. \nCustoms  administrations  need  closer  real-time  collaboration  in  facilitating \nlegitimate trade and exerting controls. The TA will include assistance in designing \na framework for an electronic information exchange among and between CAREC \ncustoms authorities that will ensure seamless, real-time, and paperless flows of \ninformation  and  connectivity.  The  ICT  systems  used  by  CAREC  customs \nadministrations will be reviewed and the feasibility of developing an information \nexchange mechanism for CAREC customs will be assessed. Drawing from the \nassessment,  a  framework  will  be  designed  for  an  electronic  information \nexchange among and between CAREC customs authorities. The framework will \nbe piloted in two countries with the view of extending it to the region at a later \nstage. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,350,000, of which $1,250,000 and will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The TA will be \npart of the \u201cTrade Facilitation Mechanism\u201d initiated by the Government of Japan in November \n2010.8 The governments of CAREC countries will provide counterpart support in the form of \nnecessary office space, counterpart staff, and other services to the consultants, and will assist \nin arranging meetings with counterpart agencies. The cost estimates and financing plan is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n7  SAFE stands for Security and Facilitation in a Global Environment. The instrument was later renamed the SAFE \nFramework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade. It was approved by the customs directors general \nof WCO member countries in June 2005. In June 2010, the WCO issued a SAFE framework package bringing \ntogether all the guidelines and instruments that support implementation of the SAFE framework. \n8  In November 2010 the Government of Japan announced a new initiative called \u201cTrade Facilitation Mechanism\u201d to \ncontribute up to $25,000,000 to ADB for trade facilitation in Asia from 2011 to 2015. The mechanism aims at \nfacilitating  trade-related  procedures,  mainly  customs-related  procedures,  with  a  view  to  contributing  to  the \nexpansion of trade and economic growth in Asia. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will serve as the executing agency. The Public Management, Financial Sector and \nRegional Cooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will serve as a focal point and \nadminister the TA in close coordination with the CAREC Unit of the Central and West Asia \nDepartment; the resident missions in CAREC countries; and the CAREC Institute which will \nprovide the TA training courses. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with the \nWCO and will contribute to implementation of the memorandum of understanding between ADB \nand WCO signed on 4 May 2010 during ADB\u2019s 43rd Annual Meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. In \naddition, the Customs and Tariff Bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Japan International \nCooperation Agency were consulted in terms of relevance and approach of the proposals. It \nwas decided that ADB will provide them with information about activities to be undertaken \nduring implementation and that the Customs and Tariff Bureau will participate in workshops and \nevents for experience sharing with CAREC countries. The 2-year implementation period will be \nfrom 1 February 2014 to 31 January 2016. \n \n15.  The TA will require 20 person-months (international) and 56 person-months (national) of \nintermittent consulting services. Consultants and resource persons will be specialists in the \nareas of customs reforms, customs law, trade facilitation, and ICT. In view of the TA\u2019s varied \nactivities, consultants and resource persons will be selected and engaged on an individual basis \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time). The outline terms of reference for consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 3. \nProceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  Progress of the TA will be monitored based on the intended outcome and outputs \ndescribed in the design and monitoring framework. Experience and knowledge gained through \nthe TA will be widely disseminated through knowledge products such as strategic publications, \npolicy and strategy papers, and conferences. \n \nIV.
