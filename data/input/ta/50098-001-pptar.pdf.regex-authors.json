Justification \n1.  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  is  necessary  to  provide  sound \nevidence to justify proceeding with the loan project. It will define the scope, cost, financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, procurement strategy, capacity development needs and post-\nproject operation and maintenance arrangements. It is necessary to establish measures for \nadherence to the safeguard policies of both the government and Asian Development Bank. The \nPPTA would provide guidance to maximize the socioeconomic benefits such as impacts on \npoverty, gender and fair employment practices. It would also provide project advance action \nsupport. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will detail a project design that is economically, financially and technically \nfeasible. It will provide advance drafts of the complete set of documentation necessary for the \nADB to proceed with internal processing. It will prepare feasibility studies which will cover \nengineering, economic, financial, social, and environmental aspects. Table A3.1 summarizes \nthe major outputs and activities. \n \n3.  Major outputs will be (i) finalization of pre-feasibility studies; (ii) feasibility study of project \nroads;  (iii)  project  components  and  capacity  building  programs;  (iv)  safeguards  planning \ndocuments, including environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental management \nplans (EMPs); resettlement plans (RPs), and Indigenous Peoples plan (IPP); (v) northwestern \nand central region-wide transport infrastructure analyses for identification and prioritization of \nneeded investments; and (vi) project start-up assistance including master bidding documents for \neach method for procuring works, goods, and services. Activities to achieve these outputs \ninclude broad stakeholder consultations, desk and field studies, and preparation of documents \nrequired by ADB. Delivery of reports may be staggered in time depending on the scheduling of \nsubcomponents. The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \n1.

The  PPTA  is  estimated  to  cost  $2  million  equivalent,  of  which  $1.8  million  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Other sources). The \ngovernment will provide in-kind counterpart support. Climate Change Fund (CCF) resources are \nbeing  considered  to  undertake  a  Climate  Risk  and  Vulnerability  Assessment  (CRVA).  In \naddition, the MOT intends to use the Project Preparation and Startup Support Facility (PPSSF) \nto prepare detailed designs. The government was advised that approval of the PPTA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The detailed cost estimate is presented in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n ($'000) \n               Total \nItem              Cost \nAsian Development Bank Financinga \n1.
