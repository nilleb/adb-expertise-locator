As South Asia rapidly urbanizes, public sector institutions do not have the capacity to \nmeet  growing  demand  for  basic  urban  services  such  as  water,  sanitation,  solid  waste \nmanagement,  drainage,  and  roads.  Services  in  most  South  Asian  cities  have  long  lacked \nresources and are underdeveloped. Poor operation and maintenance, inadequate billing and \ncollection, lack of resources for system expansions, and poor customer focus, among others, \nare chronic problems common to virtually all utilities in the region.  \n \n2.    Although the widespread push toward decentralization in recent years has improved the \nsituation somewhat by bringing responsibility and accountability closer to the people, the region \nrequires  tremendous  resources  to  keep  up  with  the  rapid  growth  in  demand  for  services. \nDecentralization has exponentially increased the pressure on local governments and utilities. \nHowever, the resource envelope available to provide such services has remained stagnant \nbecause of limited local fiscal powers and lack of capacity to bill and collect revenue, among \nother reasons. Decentralization alone will not enable urban service coverage to keep pace with \nburgeoning urban populations.  \n \n3.    Most development organizations see increased private sector participation (PSP) as the \nmost viable means to close the resource gap and to provide improved and sustainable urban \ndevelopment. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development organizations have \nmade  significant  headway  in  implementing  public\u2013private  partnerships  to  enhance  service \ndelivery in South Asia. Lessons learned from these experiences need to be disseminated more \naggressively to empower local governments to explore means for engaging the private sector in \nurban service delivery. This regional technical assistance (TA)1 will enhance information sharing \nbetween government entities involved in privatization of urban services, and will further promote \nPSP  in  urban  service  delivery  in  South  Asia.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.     Coverage of basic services in many of the largest cities in South Asia remains dismally \npoor, and the utilities\u2019 financial performance is weak. In Delhi, for example, less than 1% of \nhouseholds receive 24-hour piped water, while only about 50% of households have direct \nconnections. An estimated 53% of the water produced does not generate any revenue. In \nDhaka, about 1.5 million people do not have access to piped water, and rely on wells, vendors, \nand illegal connections. Dhaka has no 24-hour water supply, while water losses are estimated \nat 40% of production. The sewerage situation is similar in many parts of South Asia. In Karachi, \nonly 50% of households are connected to the city\u2019s sewerage system, and only about 28% of \nthe sewage is treated. Only 30% of households in Dhaka and 33% in Colombo are connected to \nthe sewerage systems. The poor disproportionately bear the burden of poor urban services. \nImproving urban service delivery would directly reduce poverty. \n \n5.    Adequate urban service coverage is vital for the economic and social sustainability of \nurban  settlements.  Several  studies  have  revealed  the  correlation  between  planned  and \nsustainable urban development and economic development.2 Poor urban service coverage is \nthe primary hindrance to a city\u2019s ability to attract investments that can transform its economy.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 28 October 2005. \n2  Examples: Mathur, A. and Om Prakash. 2005. India\u2019s Urban Sector: An Assessment. Manila; and ADB. 2005. \nCities Alliance Annual Report 2004. Manila. \n ", "2   \n6.    Although  decentralization  has  helped  make  local  governments  more  accountable, \ngovernance problems are still rampant. Many impediments continue to hinder PSP in South \nAsia, including (i) inadequate legal frameworks that in some cases do not allow for PSP in \nparticular  service  sectors;  (ii)  poor  financial  management  and  organization  of  public  utility \ncompanies; (iii) lack of a regulatory framework that provides for agreed service standards and \nconsumer rights; (iv) politicization of tariff setting; (v) immature capital markets that provide no \nlong-term debt facilities, and local banks that have no experience or technical knowledge to \ndevelop project finance lending capability; and (vi) unfriendly legal environments that are not \nconducive to certainty of outcomes. \n \n7.    Nevertheless, in recent years, ADB investments in the urban sector in South Asia have \nincluded  significant  investments  in  local  governance  reform,  and  efforts  to  strengthen  the \nadministrative, managerial, and financial capacity of local bodies.3 Local bodies and state-\nowned  enterprises  clearly  need  further  support.  The  gap  between  required  and  available \nresources remains large. Public institutions simply do not have the administrative, technical, or \nfinancial capacity, or the incentive structures to provide adequate and sustainable services, at \nleast not by themselves.    \n \n8.    While governments have struggled to develop the capacity to provide urban services, \nthe private sector has shown increased interest and competence in providing basic urban \nservices in several countries. The 1997 PSP experience in Manila\u2019s water supply system (which \ntook the form of a concession), for example, was highly successful in expanding coverage and \nimproving overall efficiency. The Manila Water Company was listed on the Philippine Stock \nExchange in 2005, in one of the best-distributed public offerings in the local market, attracting \naround 40% foreign investors.  \n \n9.    Increasingly, national and local governments are beginning to realize that they need to \nbe more proactive in engaging the private sector in rapid and sustainable urban development. \nThey are beginning to actively explore public\u2013private partnerships as a means to increase \ninvestment and keep up with growing demand for urban services. Development institutions such \nas ADB have been focusing much greater attention on private sector involvement in all aspects \nof urban development and management. This is apparent through significant private sector-led \ncomponents  in  recent  external  agency-funded  projects,  as  well  as  policy  shifts  within \ndevelopment institutions.4 \n \n10.  Although  several  recent  initiatives  have  significantly  increased  private  sector \ninvolvement in the urban sector (such as ADB\u2019s ongoing efforts in Karnataka), information on \nmethodologies, policies, and lessons learned are not easily accessible to governments. As \ngovernments and development institutions alike try to position themselves to promote more \npublic\u2013private partnerships for urban service delivery, a forum is needed to share best practices \nfrom across the region.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Examples: ADB. 2002.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n11.   The TA\u2019s goal is to raise awareness about the various PSP options and best practices to \nenhance  the  private  sector\u2019s  role  in  the  urban  sector.  Through  increased  awareness  and \nexposure to regional PSP initiatives, local governments and other subsovereign entities involved \nin urban service delivery are expected to be able to benchmark themselves and learn from each \nother. The added exposure is also expected to support efforts to decentralize urban service \ndelivery, improve governance and local capacity, and increase private sector involvement in \nurban development across the region.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA will expose the participating developing member countries to the various PSP \noptions and the potential for PSP in urban development. It will increase public sector agencies\u2019 \nawareness of deal-structuring modalities that have been used in the region, and deal structures \nthat can work. The TA will increase awareness and sensitivity to the private sector\u2019s needs and \nassessment methods so that public agencies are better equipped to explore and develop private \nsector interventions.  \n \n13.  By  increasing  awareness  of  PSP  options  and  disseminating  information  about  best \npractices,5 together with real-world examples of PSP in the urban sector, the TA will (i) help \ndecentralize urban service delivery, (ii) improve governance and management capacity, and (iii) \nincrease the level of private sector involvement in urban development across the region. The TA \nwill stimulate more active consideration of public\u2013private partnership models as a means to \nstructure urban infrastructure projects for financing without sovereign guarantees, and support \ngovernance  and  regulatory  reforms  to  create  more  efficient  markets  for  essential  urban \nservices. The TA could increase demand for ADB financing products (such as the sub- and non-\nsovereign public sector financing products, and local currency loan products that are being pilot-\ntested). \n \n14.  The final outcomes of the TA will be (i) increased awareness among government entities \nof the various PSP options and of methodologies to enhance PSP in the urban sector; (ii) \nincreased commitment to private sector involvement in basic service delivery, financing, and \nmanagement; (iii) increased exposure and awareness within public institutions to the tools, \nanalytical frameworks, regulatory issues, and other factors typically considered by private sector \nentities; and (iv) a network of public officials within key cities that understand and actively \npromote private sector involvement in urban development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will comprise workshops and training sessions on the many facets of PSP. \nTarget  participants  will  be  key  officials  in  subsovereign  governments  and  state-owned \nenterprises in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Activities will highlight lessons that \ncan be learned from ongoing regional public\u2013private partnership initiatives and models, and \nproven strategies of PSP in urban development. The TA is also expected to lay the groundwork \nfor continued engagement between regional governments and entities. All activities will be \ncarried out within Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  \n \n                                                 \n5 Criteria for identifying best practices in PSP will be developed during the TA. \n ", "4   \n16.  The  TA  will  include  training  in  contract  negotiation  and  management,  financial \nmanagement, the fundamentals of project finance and deal structuring, regulatory and legal \nframeworks,  labor  issues  in  enterprise  restructuring,  and  governance  improvement. \nPresentations  by  private  sector  entities  involved  in  urban  infrastructure  development  and \noperations will also be encouraged. Case studies and presentations on ongoing public\u2013private \npartnership  initiatives  within  the  region  will  be  highlighted  and  analyzed.  Lessons  will  be \ndisseminated to a broader audience through a project website, hosted by ADB.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, to be financed by ADB on a grant basis from \nADB's TA funding program. This will finance the workshops, training sessions, consultancy \nservices, and resource persons. The TA will also support the travel costs, accommodation and a \nstipend  for  workshop  and  training  participants  and  regional  networking  and  information \nexchanges. The TA cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A secretariat will be established within the \nSouth Asia Social Sectors Division (SASS) as the focal point for all TA activities. ADB will \nadminister the TA, in close cooperation with resident missions and host-country governments. \nCollaboration with host-country governments is expected to involve mainly workshop logistics \nand protocol. As stated earlier, all activities under this TA will be carried out within Bangladesh, \nIndia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. No-objection/concurrence letters have been received from the \nGovernments of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and one is expected from the Government \nof India. No work under this TA will commence in India until such no-objection/concurrence \nletter has been received.  \n \n19.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  February  2006  to  February  2007.  It  will  engage \ninternational resource persons with expertise in PSP, project finance, and urban infrastructure \nand municipal finance to conduct the training sessions and workshops, assisted by a domestic \nconsultant recruited in each participating country (four consultants, 3 person-months each). In \naddition,  a  domestic  consultant  will  be  engaged  for  10  person-months  to  staff  a  project \nsecretariat within ADB. The consultants will be engaged by ADB as individuals in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The \noutline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 3. Equipment and materials to \nbe financed by the TA will be procured by the consultants or ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement or other procedures acceptable to ADB.6 Upon completion of the TA, \nthe procured equipment will become the property of ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nPromoting Best Practices in Private Sector Participation in Urban Infrastructure in South Asia, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n6  Equipment will include a desktop computer, overhead projector, other peripherals, software, and multimedia \ninstruments. \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       \nIncreased PSP in urban  Number of public\u2013private  \u2022  Central and provincial  Assumption \nservice delivery in South  partnership initiatives  and local government  \u2022 The governments are \nAsia  launched for urban service  reports and statistics  committed to sustainable \ndelivery  \u2022  Reports of bilateral and  improvement of urban \n  multilateral development  services in major cities \nMore efficient urban service  organizations  Risk \ndelivery and financial  \u2022  Feedback from local  \u2022 Lack of political support for \nmanagement  governments and  increased private sector role \n  private sector agencies  in essential services \n   \n \nOutcome       \nIncreased awareness and  Senior officials within key  TA workshop attendance  Assumption \ncommitment to PSP within  government agencies in  data  \u2022 Governments will nominate \nlocal governments  each host country involved    key officials with decision-\n  in workshops or training    making power to attend \nsessions    workshops \n    Risk \n    \u2022 Officials nominated may not \n    have decision-making power \n    to push forward PSP agenda \n     \nData on ongoing PSP    Assumption \ninitiatives in the region, as  Availability of training  \u2022 Detailed information on PSP \nwell as methodologies and  materials for workshops,  initiatives in the region will be \nresearch, disseminated via  information posted on TA  documented and available, \nthe TA website and training  website, website traffic  and easily obtained for \nmaterials  dissemination \n  Risk \n\u2022 Website traffic may be low \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
