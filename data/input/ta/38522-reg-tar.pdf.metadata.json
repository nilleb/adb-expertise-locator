In 1995, the Board approved the Agriculture and Natural Resources Research (ANRR) \nPolicy Paper, which focuses on three strategic objectives: sustainable management of natural \nresources, increases in agricultural productivity, and poverty reduction. Since 1996, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  the  international  agriculture  research  centers \nthrough annual regional technical assistance (RETA). The present technical assistance (TA)1 will \nsupport development and dissemination of water-saving rice production technologies in selected \nSouth Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan) where productivity and profitability \nof rice farming are affected by drought and water shortage. The TA is in the interregional RETA \nprogram for 2005\u20132008 of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department.   \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rice  is  basic  to  food  security  and  economic  development  in  Asia.  Its  production  has \nincreased by 2.5% annually since 1965, feeding an additional 600 million people and reducing the \nreal price of rice by 75%. Reducing the income share spent by the poor on rice has been especially \ncritical for poverty reduction in Asia. This historic achievement was made possible mainly due to \nproductivity  increases  brought  about  by  the  green  revolution,  which  introduced    high-yielding \nmodern varieties and promoted fertilizer use and expansion of irrigation. In the past decade, \nhowever, productivity increases have slowed, as resources have been stretched and growth of the \nirrigated area stagnated, while rice demand continues to increase. It has been estimated that Asian \ncountries will need to increase rice production by 50% between 1997 and 2025 simply to keep \npace with population growth. To meet this demand, rice production will need to grow by at least \n1.5% per annum in the next two decades, but annual rice production growth in the region since \n1997 has been only 1%.  \n \n3.  Maintaining and increasing productivity growth in the irrigated rice systems have been \nseverely constrained by the looming water crisis in Asia. Water usage in the current rice production \nagriculture system is extremely high. It takes about 3,000 liters of water to produce 1 kilogram of \nrice. Irrigated non-agriculture areas, which provide 75% of total Asian rice production, consume \n50% of all freshwater diversions. This profligate usage of water in irrigated rice production is \nunsustainable, given the increasing demand for freshwater due to growth in rice demand and \ngrowing competition from other agriculture and nonagriculture sectors. With the current rate of \nwater usage, even maintaining productivity in many currently irrigated areas will be difficult unless \nmore water-efficient rice production technologies suitable for irrigated areas are developed.  \n \n4.  It  is  also  important  to  increase  rice  productivity  in  rain-fed  (nonirrigated)  fields,  which \noccupy over 50% of the areas planted to rice in Asia. Despite their large share in total paddy areas, \nrain-fed fields produce only a quarter of Asia\u2019s rice output largely because the constant threat of \ndrought prevents farmers from investing in yield-increasing technology. The major droughts of \n2000 and 2002 seriously affected rice production in India. In the eastern states of Jarkhand, Orissa, \nand Chhattisgarh alone, rice production losses in severe droughts (about 1 year in 5) averaged \n40% of total production with an estimated value of $650 million.2  These losses affected the \npoorest  farmers  disproportionately.    It  is  now  widely  recognized  that  any  major  productivity \nincreases in rain-fed areas will require improved varieties that use water more efficiently.  \n \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 5 January 2005. \n2  Pandey, S., H.

IRRI: Los Ba\u00f1os (Final project report). \n ", "2   \n5.  The development of rice systems that need less water has the potential to free enormous \nquantities  of  water  for  nonagricultural  use.  According  to  estimates  of  the  International  Rice \nResearch Institute (IRRI), a 10% reduction in water use for rice irrigation would free 150 billion \ncubic meters (m3), or  25% of the total freshwater used in Asia for nonagricultural purposes. \nReducing water inputs to irrigated rice will also result in significant environmental benefits.  In many \nhigh-input irrigated systems, percolation outflow from paddies results in nitrate and phosphate \npollution  of  downstream  lakes  and  rivers,  and  salinization.    Water-saving  irrigation  systems \neliminate percolation outflows, thus reducing pollution and salinization and enhancing the efficiency \nof  fertilizer  use.    Also,  by  reducing  diversion  of  surface  water,  water-saving  rice  production \ntechnologies can help maintain wetlands that provide important environmental services. In broader \nterms, the development of more efficient rice-based systems will significantly contribute to poverty \nreduction and achieving Millennium Development Goals in the region.3 \n \n6.  Two principal water-saving rice technologies are being developed; both offer large potential \nfor water savings relying mainly on seed- and knowledge-based technologies. In the alternate \nwetting and drying (AWD) system, conventionally transplanted (lowland) fields are allowed to drain \nbetween irrigations, retaining a water layer only during sensitive crop stages like flowering. AWD, \nwhich uses currently available high-yield varieties (HYVs), can reduce water usage by up to 15%, \nwith little yield loss. However, AWD is a high-risk technology at present because current HYVs are \nvery sensitive to dry soil conditions and require near-perfect irrigation control.4 Adopting AWD on a \nlarger scale will require new varieties with more tolerance to dry soils. Such varieties are being \ndeveloped at IRRI, but need further refinement and extensive evaluation in farmers\u2019 fields. The \naerobic production system is a radical approach that reduces water usage by up to 50%. Aerobic \nrice is sown in dry soil and grown without flooding. The system is a viable option now in low-input \nrain-fed systems facing drought risk, such as the Eastern Indian plateau. However, current aerobic \nrice yields are not high enough to be economically viable in irrigated areas, where input use and \nyield potential are high.5 Also, it has been observed that rice yields under an aerobic production \nsystem decline considerably over time due to causes that are not fully understood but are thought \nto be biotic (disease- and insect-related). The development and extensive testing of higher-yielding \naerobic rice varieties resistant to soil biotic stresses are needed to enhance the prospects of their \nadoption in irrigated fields.   \n \n7.  IRRI has been at the forefront of this research. Since 2000, it has dedicated substantial \nresources to the development of water-saving varieties.  IRRI\u2019s basic research on drought genetics \nhas made significant progress in developing more water-efficient varieties.  IRRI has also identified \nrice varieties that resist aerobic yield decline, tolerating continuous cropping in dry soils. IRRI has \ndeveloped strong linkages with other advance research institutes in functional genomics and gene \nexpression  and  also  collaborates  closely  on  rice  technologies  with  national  agricultural  and \nextension systems (NARES) in Asian developing countries. These earlier research and networks of \nIRRI form a solid basis on which to continue with the new stage of technology development.  \n \n8.  The TA will support the development and dissemination of water-saving rice technologies in \ndrought-prone  and  water-short  areas  of  Asia.  The  TA  will  also  strengthen  the  capacities  of \nparticipating NARES to develop locally adapted water-saving rice technologies, which are still at \n                                                 \n3  Of the eight millennium development goals, two can relate directly (Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger; \nGoal 7: Ensure Environmental Sustainability), and two indirectly (Goal 4: Reduce Child Mortality; Goal 5: Improve \nMaternal Health) to rice-based systems.    \n4  Even brief periods of soil drying during the critical flowering stage, caused by failure of an irrigation system to deliver \nwater in a timely manner, can easily reduce the yield of conventional high-yield varieties by over 50%.   \n5  IRRI research indicates that current aerobic rice yields are 20-30% lower than yields under conventional irrigated \nmanagement.   \n ", "  3\ntheir infancy, and will promote a regional network for information dissemination to ensure the \nbroader impacts of the project. The TA is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s policy on agricultural and \nnatural  resources  research  as  it  supports  increased  agricultural  productivity  and  sustainable \nmanagement  of  water  resources  in  the  region.    Water-efficient  and  drought-tolerant  varieties \nadapted to direct seeding, to be developed through this TA, will complement ADB\u2019s ongoing RETA \n6208: Integrated Crop and Resource Management in the Rice\u2013Wheat System in South Asia6 \n(aimed  at  developing  water-conserving  rice\u2013wheat  systems),  and  RETA  6136:  Improve  and \nStabilize  Crop  Productivity  in  Diverse  and  Less  Favorable  Rainfed  Areas  of  Asia7 (aimed  at \nincreasing crop productivity and reducing risks in drought-prone environments).  \n \n9.  The TA will focus on South Asia, where water shortage and droughts are endemic. During \nthe southern Indian drought of 2001\u20132004, competition for water led to disputes between the \nIndian states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Groundwater overexploitation increased pumping \ncosts and caused significant environmental problems in parts of India and Pakistan. It is estimated \nthat, by 2025, 12 million hectares (ha) of irrigated rice in South Asia may suffer from severe water \nshortage,8 with serious effects on food security and social stability of the region. For these reasons, \nthe  national  research  systems  in  South  Asia  identified  the  development  of  water-saving  rice \nproduction technologies as high priority. The Pakistan Agricultural Research Council identified the \ndevelopment of water-efficient rice cultivars as one of five major research thrusts for collaboration \nbetween Pakistan and IRRI. The Nepal Agricultural Research Council expressed strong support for \nthe  TA.  In  Bangladesh,  the  high-productivity  dry-season  (boro)  crop  is  largely  dependent  on \npumped groundwater; its profitability is threatened by rising fuel prices. The development of water-\nsaving rice varieties is a major thrust of the approved 2005\u20132008 IRRI-India work plan. \n \n10.  The TA design incorporated several key lessons from past research projects funded by \nADB, including the need for greater emphasis on (i) strengthening the capacities of NARES, (ii) \nenhancing  farmer  participation  in  evaluating  and  disseminating  new  technologies,  and  (iii) \nincreasing the focus of research themes on issues related to resource-poor farmers.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The main expected impacts of the TA are enhanced food and income securities of the rural \nand urban population, and improved environmental sustainability of rice production systems in \nwater-short and drought-prone areas of South Asia. The key outcomes of the TA will be  \n(i)  enhanced rice productivity in water-short regions,  \n(ii)  improved water use efficiency in rice production and better environmental conditions, \nand  \n(iii)  self-sustaining national research capacities to develop water-saving rice \ntechnologies. \n \n12.  The expected outputs of the TA are (i)  new water-saving rice production technologies \nbased on improved varieties, (ii) improved water-saving technologies validated and disseminated \n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2004.

The specific quantifiable \ntargets, monitoring mechanisms, and expected benefits are in the TA design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1).  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will involve both basic and adaptive research at IRRI and in collaborating national \nagricultural research centers and in farmers\u2019 fields. Highly participatory approaches will be used in \nvalidating and disseminating suitable technologies. The TA will ensure that participation of women \nin project activities is maximized and their welfare is supported. In particular, they will (i) identify \nlocal,  specific,  and  acceptable  ways  to  disseminate  the  project  information  to  women;  (ii) \nencourage  and  ensure  participation  of  women  in  technology  dissemination  activities;  and  (iii) \nensure that women have equal access to new technologies developed by participating institutions. \n \n14.  The detailed description of the TA activities is in Appendix 2. Summaries are presented \nhere.  \n(i)  Development of new water-saving rice production technologies based on improved \nvarieties. At IRRI, new varieties combining high yield with reduced water usage will be \nselected in managed-stress screening environments (AWD and aerobic). Biotic factors \ncausing yield decline will be identified, and the genetic basis of tolerance will be determined. \nTolerant lines will be used in developing new aerobic varieties that can be sustainably \nproduced in dry soils without yield decline. At least 10 new varieties combining high yield \npotential, water-use efficiency, and tolerance to yield decline factors will be distributed \nannually to national partners for further refinement, evaluation, and dissemination.    \n(ii)  Participatory validation and dissemination of water-saving technologies suitable for \ndrought-prone  and  water-short  areas.  At  target  sites,  communities  and  farmer-\ncooperators with a strong need for water-saving varieties will be identified via surveys and \nfocus-group discussions by NARES collaborators. Available IRRI and national varieties \nproducing high yields under water-saving irrigation or drought will be validated in on-station \ntrials  by  each  participating  team.    Promising  varieties  will  be  evaluated  with  farmer \nparticipation. Information will be packaged into extension-ready materials for dissemination \nas fact sheets and web pages.  \n(iii)  Development of the capacity to produce water-saving rice technologies. At project \ninitiation, an international workshop will be held to summarize knowledge on breeding and \nsustainability issues. Annually, three researchers from each participating national research \ninstitute will visit IRRI for 4 weeks for planning, data analysis, report preparation, and \ntraining in breeding, participatory research methods, impact assessment, and soil health \nmanagement. In addition, a series of training courses on the development and use of water-\nsaving technologies for rice production will be organized among national scientists, and \nextension workers of project sites.  \n(iv)  Development of a regional network for exchange of information on water-saving rice \nproduction systems in South Asia.  IRRI together with NARES teams will develop and \nmaintain a regional network for exchange of information on development of water-saving \nrice systems for broader research and development communities. The research results will \nbe disseminated through annual meetings, journal publications, and project websites. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is $2,306,000. ADB will provide $1,000,000 on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. IRRI will contribute $566,000 over 3 years. The participating national \n ", "  5\nresearch institutes of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan will provide counterpart funds of \n$740,000 in the form of staff time, land, and research facilities. The detailed cost estimates and a \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  IRRI will be the Executing Agency, with whom ADB will enter into a TA agreement. The TA \nactivities will only take place in a developing member country (DMC) after the Government of such \nDMC has given its no objection to the participation in the TA. IRRI will be fully responsible for the \nsuccessful implementation and conclusion of the TA. Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, Tamil \nNadu  Agricultural  University  of  India,  Nepal  Agricultural  Research  Council,  and  Pakistan \nAgricultural Research Council will be designated as national implementing agencies (IAs) and will \nclosely collaborate with IRRI.  IRRI will appoint a project leader (IRRI staff on part-time basis) and \nproject coordinator (full time consultant), who will be responsible for planning, coordinating, and \nsupervising all project activities, and submitting  reports to ADB and other collaborating partners. \nEach  IA  will  appoint  a  national  team  leader  and  researchers  responsible  for  coordination, \nimplementation, and reporting on the Project.  \n \n17.  The TA activities will be implemented over 36 months beginning in January 2006 and \nending in December 2008. The project steering committee consisting of the representatives of IRRI \nand of participating NARES will be established to provide regular policy guidance, monitor project \nimplementation progress, and assess the project impacts. IRRI will hold an inception workshop \nwithin 3 months after the TA starts to finalize project plans and implementation arrangements with \npartners. IRRI will also organize annual planning and review meetings and a project completion \nworkshop, which will be attended by all project partners and ADB. IRRI will submit the following \nreports to ADB: (i) an inception report within 3 months of the start of the TA, (ii) a semiannual \nprogress report every 6 months, (iii) semiannual financial statements accounting for the use of \nproject funds every 6 months, (iv) audited annual financial statements, and (v) a comprehensive \ncompletion report within 3 months of project closure. Funds will be drawn down in semiannual \ninstallments, based on IRRI\u2019s estimate of forthcoming expenditures, and subject to satisfactory \nliquidation of expenditures for previously disbursed funds. Project officers with suitable technical \nexpertise will be assigned to administer the TA at ADB, and will undertake at least one supervisory \nmission each year.  \n \n18.  The TA will finance 36 person-months of international and 180 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services in project management, water-saving rice breeding, soil microbiology, and \nsocial science. IRRI will engage consultants on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. The outline terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 4. Before \nengaging any consultant, IRRI will submit his/her curriculum vitae to ADB for approval. IRRI will \nprocure goods and materials to be financed by the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement or other procedures acceptable to ADB.  At the end of the TA, equipment purchased \nwill be assigned to IRRI or the IAs concerned. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.

Development  of  New  Water-Saving  Rice  Production  Technologies  Based  on \nImproved Varieties \n1.  Although significant gains in yield under restricted irrigation and drought have been \nmade by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) breeding program, yields of water-\nsaving varieties need to be increased further to promote their adoption in irrigated areas where \nrice  yields are  currently  high,  but  pumping  costs  and  falling  water tables  are  jeopardizing \nirrigated  production.  A  new  generation  of  higher-yielding,  more  water-efficient  varieties  for \nlowland and aerobic production will be developed at IRRI. Products (alleles, pyramided lines) \nfrom the research program on the functional genomics of rice yield under water stress will be \nused to make a major step forward in water-use efficiency and drought tolerance.  Preparatory \ncrosses were made for this output in 2004 and initial populations are now being developed, so a \nflow of materials for screening and delivery will be available at project start-up. \n \n1.  Hire Project Coordinator and Domestic Consultants \n2.  The following consultants will be hired within 3 months of project start-up. \n \n(i)  The international coordinator/agronomist will implement field research activities \nat  IRRI  and  coordinate  project  documentation  and  reporting  under  the \nsupervision of the project leader. \n \n(ii)  A domestic social scientist, agronomist, and soil microbiologist will be recruited to \nassist in implementing breeding, on-farm validation, and yield-decline studies.   \n \n(iii)  A doctoral student working on yield decline and soil health will be recruited from \none of the participating countries. \n \n2.  Develop Improved Aerobic and AWD Rice Varieties \n3.  New crosses and breeding lines will be developed for distribution to collaborators. \n \n(i)  At least 50 new crosses among first-generation aerobic rice and alternate wetting \nand  drying  (AWD)  lines  and  elite  irrigated  high-yield  varieties  (HYV)  will  be \ngenerated annually at IRRI.  Initial crosses have already been made and lines \nextracted.  \n \n(ii)  Approximately 10,000 new breeding lines will be screened yearly from these \npopulations in IRRI\u2019s breeding nurseries.  Advanced lines will be screened under \nnonstress conditions for yield potential, quality, and disease resistance.  They will \nalso be screened under both AWD and aerobic management in the dry season \nunder a regime wherein soil water potential is allowed to fall to \u201350 kPa or \u201330 \nkPa at 30 centimeters below the soil surface between irrigations for aerobic and \nAWD systems, respectively.   \n \n(iii)  At least 50 lines with acceptable quality and improved tolerance to water-saving \nirrigation will be distributed annually to collaborating national programs.  The \nperformance targets for year 3 are varieties that yield 6 tons per hectare (t/ha) \nwith water savings of 50% relative to full irrigation under aerobic management, \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nand varieties that yield 7 t/ha under AWD management with water savings of \n30%. \n \n3.  Identify Causes of Aerobic Yield Decline in Rice Crops Grown Continuously \nin Nonsaturated Soils  \n4.  On the most drought-prone lands, the sustainability of water-saving rice production is \njeopardized by a rapid decline in yield that occurs when soils are not saturated throughout the \ngrowing season. The biological causes of this decline need to be unambiguously identified so as \nto transfer tolerance to aerobic varieties. The organisms or soil conditions causing aerobic rice \nyield decline will be identified to develop reliable screening protocols for the breeding program. \n(i)  In year 1, selective control treatments (nematicide, insecticide, and fungicide) will \nbe  applied  in  replicated  trials  to  plantings  of  susceptible  varieties  in  fields \nshowing  severe  yield  decline  in  the  Philippines  and  at  partner  sites.  This \ntreatment will allow principal causal factors to be differentiated.  Collaborative \nsupport from an advanced research institute (ARI, to be identified) with expertise \nin soil microbiology will be acquired.  Research will be conducted by the doctoral \nstudent and the domestic scientist, under the supervision of the ARI scientist. \nThe travel budget will support two visits per year to IRRI and project sites by the \nARI collaborator.  \n \n(ii)  In  years  2  and  3,  specific  causal  organisms  will  be  characterized  through \ninoculated  pot  studies  at  IRRI.  A  survey  of  fields  growing  aerobic  rice \ncontinuously will be conducted at collaborating national sites.  \n \n4.  Develop Varieties Tolerant to Organisms Causing Yield Decline \n5.  Tolerance has been identified in traditional varieties of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic in the IRRI genebank, and in the irrigated HYV IR72.  The genetic basis for tolerance will \nbe studied, and tolerant varieties developed.  \n(i)  All advanced lines and hybrids (about 1,000 per year) from the aerobic and AWD \nbreeding programs will be screened in replicated yield trials at Philippine sites \ncharacterized by severe yield decline, and where the causal agent has been \nidentified in activities 3(i) and (ii). The screening will be concurrent with screening \nfor tolerance to water-saving irrigation.   \n \n(ii)  At least 20 lines exhibiting tolerance to the causal organisms as well as good \nperformance under aerobic management will be delivered annually to national \npartners for local adaptation testing. \n \n(iii)  Genetic analysis of tolerance will be conducted by mapping populations derived \nfrom preexisting crosses between tolerant and susceptible lines.  Screening will \nbe conducted in years 2 and 3.    \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \n \nB.  Validation and Dissemination of Water-Saving Rice Technologies Based on AWD \nand Aerobic Varieties  \n6.  Currently available aerobic and AWD varieties developed produce yield gains of over \n50% compared with widely used varieties like IR64 in research station trials under severely \nwater-limited conditions. Those varieties will be evaluated by the collaborating teams under the \nmanagement  of  and  in  the  fields  of  farmers  who  are  facing  severe  water  shortage.  The \nparticipatory experiments will monitor water savings, yield under restricted irrigation and drought, \nand farmer adoption. Promising varieties will be disseminated to farmers who express a strong \nneed for the technology, and uptake will be monitored. \n \n1.  Identify NARES Teams and Initiate Site Planning \n \n7.  Within 1 month of project start-up, each collaborating NARES research institution will \nidentify a team consisting of an agronomist, a breeder, a soil heath specialist, and a social \nscientist.  Within 2 months of project start-up, an initial planning meeting will be held to begin the \ndevelopment of a detailed site work plan. \n \n2.  Define Target Domain for Water-Saving Rice Varieties in Partner Countries, \nand Identify Communities Willing to Participate in Evaluation \n8.  After the target site is identified, farmer-cooperators will be recruited for participatory on-\nfarm evaluation. \n \n(i)  Each  national  research  team  will  identify  a  proposed  target  site  for  on-farm \nevaluation  and  dissemination  of  water-saving  rice  varieties  by  consulting \ngeographic information system databases, irrigation authorities, local extension \nservices, and other sources of information.  (to be completed within 3 months of \nproject start-up) \n \n(ii)  After the site has been identified, local extension and irrigation managers will be \ncontacted, and community meetings organized to explain the project and assess \nfarmer  interest.  Focus  group  discussions  and  household  surveys  will  be \nconducted to obtain detailed farmer input on water cost, availability, and risk of \ndrought or irrigation failure.  (to be completed within 6 months of project start-up) \n \n(iii)  Farmers expressing strong interest in water-saving varieties will be recruited for \nparticipatory on-farm evaluation.  At least 30 farmer-collaborators per site will be \nrecruited to participate in all phases of varietal assessment. They will be trained \nin water-saving management systems (AWD or aerobic management). (to be \ncompleted within one year of project start-up) \n \n3.  Conduct  Farmer-Participatory  Evaluation  of  Yield  and  Water  Savings  of \nAerobic and AWD Varieties  \n9.  Evaluation in years 1\u20133 will involve farmers, scientists, and extension workers. \n \n(i)  In  year  1,  varieties  will  be  obtained  from  national  sources  and  IRRI  for \npreliminary evaluation in replicated yield trials under water-saving, aerobic, or \nrain-fed management, as appropriate for each site.  All varieties will be evaluated \n ", "  Appendix 2  13 \nunder  both  full  irrigation  to  assess  yield  potential  and  either  water-saving \nirrigation or drought-prone rain-fed conditions to assess varietal tolerance to non-\nsaturated  soil  conditions.  With  scientists,  farmer-collaborators  will  evaluate \nvarieties on-station with scientists under both full and water-saving irrigation. On-\nstation trials will monitor irrigation and rainfall to estimate differences in water-use \nefficiency among varieties. \n \n(ii)  In year 2, varieties identified as promising under water-saving or drought-prone \nconditions will be evaluated by farmer-collaborators on their own farms, using a \nfarmer-managed  baby  trial  design.  At  least  three  varieties  per  site  will  be \nevaluated by a minimum of 10 farmers for yield, quality, water requirement or \ndrought tolerance, and other parameters identified by farmers as critical to their \nvariety adoption decisions.   \n \n(iii)  Beginning in year 2, at least 1 ton of seed of promising water-saving varieties will \nbe increased at each participating site. Detailed planning for year 3 scale-up of \nparticipatory varietal selection (PVS) using the baby trial model will be conducted \nwith local extension services in the target region. There will be an on-site PVS \ntraining  workshop  for  extension  staff,  and  development  and  testing  of \nquestionnaires.  \n \n(iv)  In year 3, an expanded baby trial program will be conducted using the year 2 \nseed increase.  Five-kilogram seed lots will be distributed to at least 200 farmers \nper site. Farmer preference data will be collected by collaborating extension \nworkers who were trained in the PVS training workshop as noted in (iii). After the \ngrowing season, participating farmers who have received project seed will be \ncontacted for a survey of yield, water savings, eating quality, replanting plans, \nand dissemination through informal seed exchange. \n \n(v)  In year 3, approximate water-savings will be quantified by more detailed surveys \nof at least 10 farmer-adopters per site. Quantifying measures of water use will be \nfrequency of irrigation, hours of pump operation, and fuel or electricity costs, \ncompared with the practices of nonadopting control groups. \n \nC.  Strengthening  the  Capacities  of  Participating  National  Research  Institutes  to \nDevelop and Disseminate Water-Saving Rice Production Technology \n \n10.  Most national partners do not currently have the capacity to develop varieties for water-\nsaving systems, and need to develop improved capacity for stress tolerance screening and \nparticipatory research methods.  The technical assistance will provide an intensive program of \ntraining and experience to national researchers that will result in self-sustaining programs for \ndeveloping, disseminating, and monitoring the spread and impact of water-saving varieties. \nExtension leaders and other agricultural officials in the project target areas will also be trained \non water-saving technologies.  \n1.  Conduct Project Initiation Meeting and Ancillary International Workshop on \nNeeds for Aerobic Rice Research  \n11.  Within 3 months of project initiation, a project start-up workshop will be held at IRRI \nwhere detailed project planning will take place. An ancillary workshop on aerobic rice research \npriorities  will  occur  immediately  before,  bringing  together  experts  on  water-saving  rice \nproduction to assess the state of the art and assemble the latest information on promising \n ", "14  Appendix 2 \ngermplasm, screening methods, and sustainability issues.  Proceedings of this workshop will be \npublished.  \n \n2.  Train NARES Research Teams in Methods of Developing, Validating, and \nDisseminating Water-saving Varieties \n12.  Three researchers from each site each year stay at IRRI for 1 month for an intensive \nperiod of planning, data analysis, report preparation, and training in breeding, participatory \nresearch methods, drought screening, water use monitoring or impact assessment depending \non site needs. Over the course of the project, at least four researchers and research managers \nper country will be trained to a level where they can serve as trainers for the national system.  \n \n3.  Extension Managers in Water-Saving Rice Production Technologies and \nTheir Dissemination \n13.  Workshops on water-saving technology will be held for key extension and research \nleaders in each country in years 2 and 3. One of the objectives of the workshops will be to \nobtain  the  active  support  and  collaboration  of  extension  services  for  scaled-up  PVS  and \ndissemination activities in year 3. \n \nD.  A Regional Network for Exchange of Information in Coping with Water Shortage in \nRice Production \n \n14.  The four participating South Asian countries face many similar problems with respect to \nwater  shortage  in  rice  production.  Direct  exchange  of  experience  and  information  among \nNARES will facilitate the development and adoption of water-saving rice production systems.  \nThe TA will support a regional network that is expected to be self-sustaining after the completion \nof the project. \n \n(i)  In  addition  to  the  project  start-up  workshop,  an  annual  workshop  will  be \nconducted each year at one of the participating member sites where results will \nbe presented, experiences exchanged, and research priorities set. Because most \nresearch activity will be conducted in the wet season (except for Bangladesh, \nwhere the focus will be on boro rice), the meeting will be conducted during the \ndry season.  \n \n(ii)  Over the project life, each team will participate in at least one cross-site visit to \nobserve the research program of another team facing similar problems. \n \n(iii)  Project results will be documented on a fully accessible web page maintained by \nIRRI as part of the ADB-supported Rice Knowledge Bank (RKB) (see RETA \n9047).1 Extension-ready materials, including variety descriptions and fact sheets \non  management  practices  will  be  maintained    within  the  RKB;  collaborating \ninstitutions will oversee translation into local languages. At least one scientific \narticle, published in an international peer-reviewed journal, will be published on \neach of the following topics: aerobic rice cultivar agronomic performance and \nwater, AWD cultivar agronomic performance and water use, causal organism for \naerobic yield decline, cultivar tolerance to factors causing aerobic yield decline.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.
