INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Government of \nMongolia in institutional strengthening and capacity building on road safety to help implement the \nroad safety policy and action plan developed under the ongoing TA for the Development of Road \nSafety Policy and Action Plan.1 This 2018 TA is included in the country operations business plan \nfor Mongolia, 2018\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia is a landlocked country covering an area of 1.56 million square kilometers. It has \na population of only 3 million people, 77% of whom live in urban areas. The primary mode of \ntransportation is through an expansive but poorly maintained road network. In 2016, reported road \ncrashes were the fifth leading cause of deaths in Mongolia, following cardiovascular diseases and \ngastrointestinal cancers, and adults 19\u201339 years old comprised more than 50% of road crash \ndeaths and injuries.3 Up to 50 schoolchildren are killed annually going to and from school. More \nthan 75% of recorded deaths are outside Ulaanbaatar where post-crash response is lacking, \ndrunk driving is twice as common, and the likelihood of seat belt use is 50% lower than in \nUlaanbaatar.4 The vehicle fleet in Mongolia more than doubled during 2011\u20132016, and the \nnumber of reported crashes also increased from 21,302 to 46,712. Road crash deaths and injuries \nare likely to increase markedly over the coming decades as vehicle ownership continues to grow \nin Mongolia, thereby affecting medium- and long-term growth prospects by removing adults from \nthe workforce and reducing the productivity of injured workers.5 \n \n3.  Following the United Nations\u2019 declaration of the Decade of Action for Road Safety in May \n2011, Mongolia issued its National Strategy on Traffic Safety, including an implementation plan \nfor 2012\u20132020 targeting a 50% decrease in traffic-related deaths and serious injuries.6 However, \nthe  implementation  arrangements  had  insufficient  detail  and  did  not  come  with  enabling \ninstitutional frameworks, safety standards, or an enforcement plan for stakeholder agencies and \ninstitutions. To address these issues, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided TA to \nestablish a comprehensive national road safety policy and a detailed action plan (footnote 1). \nWhen it is completed in September 2018, the TA will have (i) established a road safety steering \ncommittee and peer group; (ii) produced a white paper and a road safety policy and action plan; \nand (iii) provided introductory training to stakeholders in the five pillars for focus during the Decade \nof Action for Road Safety: road safety management, infrastructure, safe vehicles, road user \nbehavior, and post-crash response.7 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

The National Strategy \non Traffic Safety. Resolution No. 146. Ulaanbaatar. The Prime Minister of Mongolia and the minister of road, \ntransportation, construction, and city development approved the strategy on 2 May 2012. \n7  The project steering committee was established 4 July 2017. The committee includes representatives from the Law \nEnforcement University, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of \nRoad and Transport Development, and National Traffic Police. \n ", "2 \n4.  The draft action plan identifies areas for improvement on road safety, particularly the need \nto enhance institutional arrangements, capacity, and expertise to implement the action plan \neffectively.8 Although introductory training sessions have been offered on the five pillars, including \n(i) engineering training for road safety practitioners; (ii) road safety awareness campaigning for \norganizations involved in road safety awareness; (iii) vocational driver training for bus and truck \ndrivers and driving instructors; (iv) first aid training of trainer doctors and nurses for first responder \ntraining in local health centers; and (v) traffic police officer training to strengthen capacity related \nto road safety, additional specialized training on these topics for road safety staff is required. \nCapacity also needs to be strengthened in road safety education curriculum development in \nschools for teachers and school presentations by the National Traffic Police to support efforts to \nreduce crash-related deaths and injuries of schoolchildren. The road safety steering committee \nand peer group established under the ongoing TA should be fostered to refine the roles and \nresponsibilities  of  each  of  the  agencies,  review  the  current  institutions,  and  develop  any \nrecommendations for reform. \n \n5.  A crash database and crash investigation application was developed and pilot-tested \nunder the ongoing TA in collaboration with the National Traffic Police to record crash data and \ngenerate police reports on tablets connected to a global positioning system. The database serves \na  secondary  function  as  collected  data  can  support  the  Ministry  of  Road  and  Transport \nDevelopment (MRTD) and other stakeholders in identifying black spots9 or causes of crashes that \nneed to be addressed. Data from crashes that occurred between January and June 2018 is \ncurrently being entered into the database; the National Traffic Police will roll out the database for \nfull-time, daily traffic police operations by October 2018. Traffic police officers need to undergo \ntraining on crash scene analysis to refine their skills. The database\u2019s second function will be \nenabled in the future as more data is inputted over time and a sufficient amount of data is recorded \nfor meaningful analysis. As this next phase in the application of the crash database approaches, \nthe MRTD and other related agencies will need to build its capacity to analyze data and develop \neffective solutions. \n \n6.  Through the activities of the ongoing TA, it has become clear that Mongolia adopted many \nguiding documents related to road safety (such as manuals, standards, policies, and other \nguidelines) without adapting them to local circumstances. Guidelines that had been adapted to \nthe local context were not implemented effectively or lacked sufficient policies to guide their \nimplementation. These guidelines need to be analyzed further by the respective agencies to \ndetermine  their  relevance,  application,  and  effectiveness  in  Mongolia\u2019s  context;  and \nrecommendations for revisions should be developed. \n \n7.  During  the  ongoing  TA,  two  public  awareness  campaigns  were  developed  and \nimplemented  in  collaboration  with  a  campaign  reference  group  representing  the  steering \ncommittee agencies on seat belt use along busy roads in Ulaanbaatar in November 2017 and in \nFebruary 2018. These campaigns were conducted with nongovernment organizations to improve \ncivil society engagement and enhance the effectiveness of the campaigns. Implementing related \ncampaigns will reinforce the importance of seat belt use and further improve road safety outcomes. \nOne related area that would benefit from increased public awareness is the use of child restraints, \nas people in Mongolia often do not use child restraints or use them incorrectly (e.g., forward-\nfacing instead of rear-facing, placement in front passenger seat). Other related campaigns to \n                                                \n8  The draft Action Plan was submitted to ADB and the MRTD on 28 May 2018, and ADB and the MRTD have provided \ncomments. The action plan will be included in the Final Report to be submitted to ADB and the MRTD on 31 August \n2018. \n9  A place where road traffic crashes have historically been concentrated. \n ", "3 \nconsider are helmet use, drunk driving, and distracted driving (e.g., use of mobile phones while \ndriving). \n \n8.  The  ongoing  TA  has  made  progress  in  providing  initial  road  safety  support  to  the \ngovernment and has identified additional needs such as institutional strengthening and capacity \nbuilding to implement the road safety policy and action plan, requiring activities outlined in this \n2018 TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: road crash fatalities and serious injuries in \nMongolia reduced.10 The TA will have the following outcome: implementation of the road safety \npolicy and action plan improved.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Road safety management capacity improved. The ongoing TA has offered \ndifferent introductory training sessions on the Decade of Action for Road Safety\u2019s five pillars. \nOutput 1 will provide specialized trainings on the same topics for road safety staff within the MRTD \nas  well  as  other  government  officials;  other  topics  could  be  explored  (e.g.  positive \nreinforcement).12 It will also (i) develop road safety education materials for school presentations \nby the traffic police to improve their messaging for the target age groups in the schools; and \n(ii) design and implement a campaign on the use of child restraints. The TA will continue to \nsupport the coordination of the steering committee and peer group.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Crash analysis capacity improved. Output 2 will support the MRTD, the traffic \npolice, and other stakeholders in pilot-testing an independent crash investigation body in Mongolia \nand in analyzing crash scenes and crash data. It will focus on criteria for choosing themes and \nmethods for identifying root causes for crashes, developing solutions, and reporting. The output \nwill provide training on (i) inputting data to the database while at crash scenes; and (ii) conducting \ncrash data analysis to identify black spots, including a practical pilot test on road safety auditing \nat a black spot identified from the crash data; and (iii) developing appropriate solutions based on \nthe analysis, such as education and awareness campaigns, infrastructure treatments, and road \noperations. etc.  \n \n12.  Output 3: Recommendations and revisions of national road safety guidelines and \nmanuals developed. Output 3 will review international best practices, existing documents, and \nimplementation of the guidelines by analyzing the current guiding documents related to road \nsafety to identify gaps or areas for revision.13 It will examine other external factors as necessary. \nBased on the analysis, the TA will develop recommendations for revisions and amend selected \ndocuments, as agreed with the respective agencies, to address Mongolia-specific issues.  \n \n                                                \n10 Government of Mongolia. 2012.
