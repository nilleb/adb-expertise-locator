Background \n \n1.  Transport and urban development are essential cornerstones in achieving livable cities \nthat  are  economically  competitive,  socially  inclusive,  and  environmentally  sustainable,  as \narticulated in ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework, Strategy 2020.1  To mainstream sustainable \ntransport  practices  across  ADB\u2019s  operations  and  support  poverty  reduction  in  developing \nmember countries (DMCs), ADB launched the Sustainable Transport Initiative (STI)2 in 2010.  \nUnder the STI, ADB has prioritized renewed investment and effort in the areas of (i) urban \ntransport; (ii) transport and climate change; (iii) logistics and cross-border transport; and, (iv) \nroad safety and social sustainability. \n \n2.  Rapid urbanization in Asia and the Pacific is accelerating private vehicle motorization at \nan unprecedented rate across the region.  In 1980, just 9% of the world\u2019s 360 million motorized \nvehicles were found in Asia and the Pacific.  By 2030, nearly half of the world\u2019s projected 1.5 \nbillion vehicles will be in the region.  The impacts of rapid and uncontrolled motorization affect \nthe realization of environmental and social sustainability objectives. This subproject will create \nquality demonstrations of nonmotorized transport (NMT) in order to help offset these trends. \n \nB.  Rationale \n \n3.  NMT  encompasses  the  most  fundamental  of  transport  options,  including  walking, \nbicycles, tricycles, pedicabs, and other human powered vehicles. NMT represents the most \naffordable, base mode by which the urban poor use to access jobs and critical public services, \nsuch as education and healthcare. Of all income groups, low-income households often spend \nthe highest percentage of their incomes on transport, reaching approximately 40% of income in \nsome developing nations.3 This burden can be alleviated through quality NMT facilities and \nvehicles. \n \n4.  NMT facilities are particularly critical to the most vulnerable road users; these groups \ninclude the physically disabled, the elderly, women, road vendors, and students. Over half of the \nroad fatalities in Asia and the Pacific are pedestrians and other NMT road users who incur the \ncosts of motorization with few of the benefits. The quality of NMT facilities is determinant on \nwhether vulnerable groups are able to participate effectively in society and the economy.   \n \n5.  Despite nonmotorized transport\u2019s role in advancing economic and social development \nfor urban low-income groups, NMT-related infrastructure and services typically receive little \npublic  investment.4 NMT,  though,  can  be  instrumental  in  local  economic  development  as \n                                                \n1 Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Strategy2020/Strategy2020.pdf  \n2 Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/policies/sustainable-transport-initiative/Sustainable-Transport-\nInitiative.pdf  \n3Vasconcellos, E (2001), Urban transport, environment and equity: The case for developing countries. London: \nEarthscan. \n4 Prakash Menon, R. (2011), Transport budget analysis: 2011-12, Pune: Parisar. ", "2 \n \ndemonstrated by successes in New York, London,5 Copenhagen,6 Tokyo,7 and Shanghai.8  The \ncase of the Cheonggyecheon stream regeneration in Seoul is particularly noteworthy.  In the \nfirst year after the replacing an elevated expressway with the restored stream, approximately 40 \nmillion  persons  visited  the  site.  According  to  the  Seoul  Development  Institute,  the \nCheonggyecheon stream regeneration has produced economic benefits of up to $23 billion. \n    \n6.  To date, relatively few high-quality pedestrian or bicycle facilities exist in the developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of ADB.  The lack of an understanding of NMT\u2019s development role \nhas in turn led to a preference for many cities in the region to focus somewhat exclusively on \nroadway investments catering to cars and motorcycles.  In turn, the economic, environmental, \nand social benefits of quality NMT facilities are not being pursued as development opportunities. \nFurthermore, this lack of NMT investment in cities of Asia and Pacific has led to heightened \nlevels of traffic collisions, pollution, and community severance. \n \n7.  The activities under this subproject will develop demonstrations of quality NMT facilities.  \nThese demonstration efforts are being designed to encourage replication as a way to both \nmainstream NMT within ADB\u2019s investment portfolio and to deliver more NMT support across the \nAsia and Pacific region. This technical assistance will also support the creation of technical \nguidance tools that will help capture the lessons learned of the NMT demonstrations. \n \nC.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of this subproject is the delivery of efficient, safe, affordable, and sustainable \nNMT facilities developed in the three demonstration cities with replication across Asia and the \nPacific.  By facilitating the development and implementation of quality pedestrian areas and the \ndemonstration of NMT facilities and technologies, this technical assistance will provide a basis \nfor future scaling-up of these types of interventions. This project will lead to an outcome in which \naccess and mobility to jobs and services for the urban poor and vulnerable groups are improved \nthrough the provision of quality NMT facilities in the demonstration cities. This project will \nparticularly highlight the social sustainability benefits of NMT investment through the delivery of \na  technical  design  guidance  tool.  The  specific  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  this \ntechnical assistance is provided in Appendix 1.  \n  \nD.  Methodology, Key Activities and Outputs \n \n9.  This subproject will provide pilot investment in capacity building, conceptual planning, \nand demonstration units of NMT facilities and vehicles in order to develop quality pedestrian and \nbicycle facilities for urban areas in three countries: Indonesia, Lao PDR, and the Philippines.   \n \n10.  The demonstration countries and cities have been selected based on several criteria, \nespecially from the perspective of complementing and enhancing ongoing and planned urban \ntransport projects of ADB.  The selection process has been undertaken in conjunction with key \nrelevant stakeholders, including the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), Embassies of \nJapan of the respective countries, ADB\u2019s Office for Cofinancing Operations (OCO), ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n5  The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (2007), Paved with gold: The real value of good street \ndesign.

", "3 \n \nSoutheast Asia Regional Department (SERD), and local officials in the respective countries and \ncities. Indonesia, Lao PDR, and the Philippines all host urban areas in which income levels \nrequire  the  importance  of  nonmotorized  mobility  while  simultaneously  lacking  sufficient \nresources to address these mobility needs. In consultation with local, national, and international \nstakeholders  the  cities of  Davao  in the  Philippines  and  Vientiane  in Lao  PDR  have  been \nselected for the demonstration.  These cities have been chosen based on local and national \nsupport of the demonstrations and the potential role these cities can play in wider replication.  A \nfinal selection of the Indonesian city will be conducted during the initial scoping phase of the \ninitiative.   \n \n11.  The target groups of the subproject are local and national transport officials and staff in \nDMCs, social sustainability and social development professionals, business communities and \ncivil society groups in the NMT demonstration sites, and ADB staff.   \n \n12.  This subproject consists of three principal activities.  First, capacity-building, stakeholder \ndiscussions, and initial planning analysis will be undertaken in three demonstration locations \n(Indonesia, Lao PDR, and the Philippines) as part of project conceptualization. In particular, the \nstakeholder discussions will lead to a needs assessment of the potential beneficiaries, which will \nshape the project design. At the conclusion of this effort, business cases are to be readied to \nmove forward implementation. Second, a small number of demonstration NMT vehicles will be \ndeployed  in  the  cities  to  gauge  applicability  and  to  stimulate  full  implementation  of  the \nsupporting infrastructure. Third, a design guide on NMT facilities will be produced to capture the \nlessons from these demonstration efforts and to especially highlight the social benefits of these \ntypes of projects. Outreach and knowledge product dissemination will be conducted both within \nADB and to DMC representatives across the region. \n \n13.  Under the first activity, the city demonstration initiatives will consist of several planning \nsubcomponents, including: \n \n(i)  Initial consultation and knowledge sharing with key stakeholders \nA survey of existing national and local policies related to NMT will be conducted at \nthe outset of this initiative.  Capacity building engagement with local and national \ngovernment officials will be provided to allow greater understanding of the technical \noptions related to NMT facilities and identification of barriers.  Discussions with the \nbusiness community and civil society groups will also be undertaken to shape the \nappropriateness of the conceptual design. This engagement will continue through \nthe conceptual planning process with the objective being the local approval for the \nfurther development of the proposed NMT intervention. \n \n(ii)  Conceptual planning \nThe conceptual planning stage will focus on the initial design work for the proposed \nNMT intervention.  For pedestrian area and cycle way development, the conceptual \ndesign  will  include  appraisal  of  the  road  design  options  and  the  production  of \nrenderings.    While  the  focus  of  the  conceptual  plan  will  be  upon  NMT,  such \ninterventions  will  achieve  optimal  results  when  integrated  with  other  forms  of \ntransport and especially with public transport.  The conceptual planning process will \nalso include a costing and financial analysis of the proposal. \n \n(iii)  Implementation planning \nThe final  stage  of  this  technical  assistance  will  be  the  preparation  of  terms of \nreferences (TOR) for the implementation of the NMT proposal. The TOR(s) will ", "4 \n \ninclude the detailed design of the infrastructure and the implementation of a full \nstakeholder  engagement  process.  This  stage  will  also  involve  discussions  with \nrepresentatives of ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Regional Department and the local and \nnational entities to determine the funding and financing plan for the project. \n \n14.  The second activity will result in the provision of tangible demonstration units of NMT \nvehicles  to  the  cities.  Depending  upon  the  outcome  of  the  first  activity  and  stakeholder \ndiscussions, a range of potential NMT demonstration units may be available for trials, including \nshare  bikes,  pedicabs,  and  cargo  bicycles.  To  determine  the  appropriate  types  and \nspecifications of NMT technologies to be utilized, an international Design Charrette will be \nconducted,  bringing  together  local  stakeholders  and  international  NMT  specialists.  The \nimplementation of the demonstration units will include an analysis of the targeted beneficiaries \nand a determination of the appropriate mechanism for technology distribution. \n \n15.  The third activity is to develop technical guidance tools and knowledge products that will \nassist ADB and DMC technical staff in planning, developing, and implementing high-quality \nNMT  facilities  that  realize  socially  sustainable  outcomes.  This  technical  assistance  will \nencompass the following guidance tools and knowledge products: \n \n(i)  ADB  has  developed  an  on-line  resource  entitled  \u201cGuidelines  for  Non-Motorized \nTransport Measures: Policy and Options\u201d.9 This technical assistance will provide \nfurther technical inputs into this knowledge resource. \n(ii)  This technical assistance will also provide NMT-related inputs into ADB\u2019s current \nwork on a \u201cSustainable Transport Appraisal Framework\u201d, which seeks to broaden \nthe  evaluation  of  transport  initiatives  to  include  a  full  array  of  economic, \nenvironmental, and social considerations.   \n(iii)  In  order  to  capture  lessons  from  the  three  demonstration  cities,  this  technical \nassistance will also support the development of an NMT Design Guide that will \nprovide  practical  guidance  on  planning  practices,  design  options,  and \nimplementation issues for NMT.   \n \n16.  An extensive outreach and information dissemination effort will then be conducted to \nshare the technical assistance results with DMC officials from across Asia and the Pacific.  The \nconceptual city plans and social sustainability assessment tool will be developed as knowledge \nproducts for wider distribution.  In addition, a project workshop will afford the opportunity for \ngovernment officials and other stakeholders to share the outputs and results between the three \ncities.  Opportunities will also be provided to present the city conceptual NMT plans and the \nknowledge products to a wider regional audience at major conference events such as the \nUNCRD Environmentally-Sustainable Transport Forum.  Finally, the results from these outputs \nwill also be discussed and presented to ADB transport staff as a part of training exercises with \nthe intent of creating the opportunity for greater NMT project replication. \n \nE.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The subproject cost is estimated at $2.0 million and is financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plans for the subproject are in Appendix 2. \n \n \n                                                \n9 Available at: http://sti-india-uttoolkit.adb.org/mod5/index.html \n ", "5 \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will act as the executing agency for the technical assistance.  The subproject will be \nmanaged  by  RSDD\u2019s  Sustainable  Infrastructure  Division  (RSID)  in  coordination  with  the \nTransport Community of Practice and with regional departments. Interaction will also be sought \nwith  key  other  Communities  of  Practice  (COP)  at  ADB,  especially  the  CoPs  for  Urban \nDevelopment, Health, Social Development, and Poverty Reduction.  Regular progress reports \nwill be submitted to the TCOP Management Committee.  Close cooperation will be sought both \nwith  the  relevant  project  officers  in  the  regional  departments  and  members  of  the  TCOP \nAdvisory Team on Social Sustainability and the TCOP Advisory Team on Urban Transport. The \nclose coordination with the TCOP should help to ensure that the outputs of the subproject are \nfully utilized as an input to sector work by regional departments in support of the development of \nADB\u2019s future transport efforts.10 \n \n19.  The subproject will be implemented over 14 months starting from November 2012, and \nterminating at the end of December 2013.  \n \n20.  The subproject will require an estimated 60 person-months of international consulting \nservices and 76 person-months of national consulting services. There will be a total of three \nconsultant appointments: \n \n(i)  National individual consultant (13 person-months) \n(ii) International firm (56 person-months of international consultants, 63 person-months \nof national consultants) \n(iii) International individual consultant (4 person-months) \n \nThe firm appointment will be selected on a basis of QCBS with a quality-cost ratio of 80:20. All \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n21.  This  technical  assistance  does  entail  the  procurement  of  goods  and  equipment, \nspecifically the procurement of demonstration NMT units. All procurement of goods and other \nservices under the subproject will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(April 2010, as amended from time to time). As per discussions with JFPR, NMT demonstration \nunits  will    not  be  considered  vehicles  in  terms  of  the  prohibitions  noted  in  the  JFPR \nimplementation guidelines. As the NMT units are for the explicit use of demonstrating the \npotential of NMT, these vehicles are acceptable project outputs by JFPR. Procurement will be \nconducted directly by ADB as the executing agency. RSDD will consult with OAIS to determine \nthe most economic means of procuring the items, with OAIS being responsible for signing the \ncontract with the suppliers. \n \n22.  Upon completion of the subproject, any equipment, software or data procured by the \nconsultants under the subproject will be turned over to ADB.  However, the NMT demonstration \nunits that are distributed to the local governments will not be turned over to ADB, as these \nvehicles are specific outputs of the project, as discussed with JFPR. Disbursements under the \nsubproject  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                \n10  ADB-funded activities in a particular DMC will commence only after ADB has received a no-objection in writing \nfrom the government of the DMC.

The  subproject  will  be  implemented  through  three  consultant  appointments.  The \nprincipal  appointment  will  be  for  an  international  firm  to  undertake  NMT  planning  and \ndemonstration activities in the three cities.  There will be two individual consultant appointments: \n(i)  International  Institutional  Specialist  for  Vientiane,  and  (ii)  National  NMT  and  Social \nSustainability Coordinator based at ADB Headquarters.  The total level of effort represented will \nbe 60 person months for international consultants and 76 months for national consultants. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  The consultants' \ndetailed tasks are described below. \n \n2.   A national individual consultant (NMT and Social Sustainability Coordinator) is to be \nappointed to provide a project coordination role across the various components of this overall \ninitiative.  The NMT and Social Sustainability Coordinator will assist ADB in facilitating activities, \nback-stopping  project  management,  and  coordinating  the  various  consultant  teams  on  the \noverall technical assistance project. The NMT and Social Sustainability Coordinator will report \ndirectly to the ADB Project Officer for this initiative. This position will also be the principal liaison \nbetween the project and the Advisory Team on Social Sustainability within the ADB Transport \nCommunity of Practice.  A total of 13 person-months are requested for this appointment.  The \nconsultant will report to the Senior Transport Specialist within ADB\u2019s Sustainable Infrastructure \nDivision (RSID). \n \nThe specific tasks of the NMT and Social Sustainability Coordinator are provided as follows: \n \nNMT and Social Sustainability Coordinator (national, intermittent, 13 person-months) \n \n\uf0b7  Maintain an overall project timeline and Gantt chart \n\uf0b7  Maintain a contact directory of all stakeholders related to this initiative \n\uf0b7  Act as a liaison between the project and the ADB Advisory Team on Social \nSustainability \n\uf0b7  Manage the preparation of the International Design Charrette on NMT vehicles \n\uf0b7  Provide administrative support on ADB procedures, as requested \n\uf0b7  Communicate with and convey information to the consultant teams \n\uf0b7  Ensure knowledge sharing between the city projects  \n\uf0b7  Assist in organizing workshops, video teleconferences, and other project related \noutreach and communications activities, including a workshop between the three \ncities to share lessons \n\uf0b7  Provide technical assistance support to the various project components \n\uf0b7  Collect and distribute NMT guidance documentation to the city project teams \n\uf0b7  Assist in producing additional knowledge products, such as a project brochure \n\uf0b7  Provide summary of project updates to the ADB TCoP newsletter and the ADB \ntransport website. \n \n3.   An international consultant firm is to be appointed to lead the conceptual planning work \nin Davao, Vientiane, and the Indonesian city.  In the case of Indonesia, the city of Surabaya had \nbeen initially identified as a city option for this work, but subsequent indications have been given \nthat the city may not be an appropriate option due to conflicting work being currently undertaken \nby another multi-lateral development bank. Additional background and capacity work will be ", "11 \n \nconducted to determine the final city choice for Indonesia.
