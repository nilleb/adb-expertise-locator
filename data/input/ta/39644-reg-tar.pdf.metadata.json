The Asian Development Bank (ADB) anticorruption policy1 has three objectives: (i) \nsupport  competitive  markets  and  efficient,  effective,  accountable,  and  transparent  public \nadministration as part of ADB\u2019s broader work on good governance and capacity building; (ii) \nsupport promising anticorruption efforts and improve the quality of dialogue on governance and \ncorruption with developing member countries (DMCs); and (iii) ensure that ADB projects and \nstaff members adhere to the highest ethical standards. This technical assistance (TA)2 project \nfocuses on the third objective by maintaining the integrity of ADB lending and nonlending \noperations. This is the first regional anticorruption seminar funded by ADB\u2019s TA grant.  \n \n2.  ADB  has  helped  borrowers  and  executing  agencies  strengthen  their  capabilities  to \nimplement projects. By improving their procurement practices and capacity to detect, deter, and \naddress potential fraud and corruption in ADB-financed projects, DMCs will be better equipped \nto achieve the objectives of ADB projects and will benefit from their results and impacts. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB  affirms  that  corrupt  and  illicit  behavior  seriously  threatens  development.  The \nanticorruption policy is part of ADB\u2019s broader effort to advance transparency, predictability, \naccountability, and participation under its governance policy. The Office of the Auditor General, \nIntegrity Division (OAGI), is the initial point of contact for allegations of fraud and corruption in \nADB-financed projects or among their staff members, as designated by the anticorruption policy. \n \n4.  OAGI coordinates with ADB regional departments and the Central Operations Services \nOffice to ensure the timely detection and prevention of fraud and corruption in its operations. For \nexample, procurement in ADB projects has been audited since 2003. OAGI has promoted \ncompliance with the anticorruption policy by providing resource speakers for ADB-sponsored \nseminars and/or workshops for borrowers and executing agencies. However, efforts must be \nexpanded to expose DMC officials to indicators of fraud and corruption, outline measures to \naddress  such  concerns,  and  emphasize  borrowers\u2019  obligations  to  perform  adequate  due \ndiligence in implementing ADB-financed projects. \n \n5.  Through a periodic seminar it designed, developed, and conducted, OAGI will be able to \nfocus  on  specific  issues,  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  borrowers,  executing  agencies, \nsupreme  audit  institutions,  and  other  government  institutions  responsible  for  project \nadministration, procurement, audit, and anticorruption efforts in DMCs. \n \n6.  The TA beneficiaries will better appreciate ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and procedures \nand be able to identify and address potential fraud and corruption in ADB-financed activities, \nand so improve project implementation.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila (Board Paper R89-98, 2 July). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 November 2005. \n ", "2   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA\u2019s objective is to improve project implementation by increasing the understanding \nof potential fraud and corruption in ADB-financed activities. The TA will increase the borrowers\u2019 \nand/or executing agencies\u2019 awareness of and compliance with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and \nprocedures, enhance their capacity to detect and prevent fraud and corruption in ADB-financed \nprojects,  and  enable  DMC  officials  to  gain  greater  knowledge  of  other  DMCs\u2019  policy \napplications.  \n \n B.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  A regional seminar will be held for 2.5 days at the ADB headquarters in the second half \nof 2006, with about 50 participants from selected DMCs, including representatives of borrowers \nand executing agencies dealing with ADB-financed projects. ADB\u2019s regional departments will \nnominate  participants.  The  list  of  nominees  will  be  submitted  to  the  governments  for \nendorsement. Acceptance of additional nominations from the governments will be subject to \nconfirmation  by  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  resident  missions  and/or  counterpart  agencies  in  DMCs  may \nrecommend  government  and/or  ministry  officials.  All  participants  must  have  a  working \nknowledge of English. \n \n9.  Some DMCs with over $230 million outstanding loans as of 18 November 2005 have \nbeen selected (Appendix 2) to ensure that the TA will provide the maximum benefits to the \nparticipants. Other countries will be included based on request and available budget. Target \nparticipants for the first regional seminar will be project managers, procurement officials, and \nother  government  officials,  based  on  consultation  with  government  divisions  and/or \ndepartments.  \n \n10.  The first 2 days of the seminar will deal with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and ways to \nprevent and detect fraud and corruption in ADB-financed projects, e.g., procurement audit \nmethodologies.  The  last  half-day  of  the  seminar  will  be  a  networking  session  to  allow \nparticipants to share experiences and discuss procurement and governance. Collective action \nplans to promote regional, country, and project-specific anticorruption efforts, in line with RETA \n6196,3 may be discussed and agreed on. Any potential topics and action plans from this \nseminar will be expanded and included as part of the agenda in two regional seminars. \n \n11.  Pre-seminar  questionnaires  will  be  sent  to  prospective  participants  to  help  focus \ndiscussions. The results will be refined for the next two regional seminars, incorporating lessons \nlearned from the first seminar to ensure more extensive involvement of beneficiaries. \n \n12.  One seminar will be held in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in the first half of \n2007,  and  one  in  India  in  the  second  half.  These  seminars  will  target  a  wider  range  of \nparticipants than the first seminar, including project implementation unit officials, who will be \ndirectly involved in day-to-day project implementation. These countries were selected based on \ntheir number of ADB-financed loans, proximity to other selected countries, accessibility, and \nwillingness to host the seminars (Appendix 2). Half the targeted participants are expected to be \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 1996. Implementation of the ADB-OECD Anticorruption Initiative for Asia-Pacific.

ADB resident missions will be asked \nto help identify participants and coordinate with executing agencies.  \n \n13.  The  seminars  will  consist  of  lectures  and  special  presentations  by  OAGI\u2019s  integrity \nspecialists (financial investigators), presentation of country experiences, and workshops on \nspecific anticorruption issues.  \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n15.  ADB, through OAGI, will be responsible for implementing the TA, including planning the \nseminar  contents  and  preparing  the  presentation  materials.  OAGI  will  recruit  a  domestic \nindividual consultant for a total of 20 person-weeks for the administrative arrangements. The \nconsultant will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The \nconsultant must be knowledgeable about ADB\u2019s setup, policies, procedures, and operations. \nThe outline terms of reference for domestic consulting services are in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  The first seminar will be conducted in Manila, Philippines, tentatively on 23 October \n2006. The next two seminars will be held in Beijing, PRC, on 23 April 2007, and in New Delhi, \nIndia, on 24 September 2007. The estimated completion date is December 2007. No-objection \nand/or concurrence letters will be obtained from the majority of participating DMCs and host \ncountries. Work under this TA will not begin until OAGI has received the no-objection and/or \nconcurrence letters. \n \n17.  At the end of each seminar, participants will evaluate the usefulness of the seminar and \nthe logistical and administrative arrangements. Their feedback will help the Office of the Auditor \nGeneral improve the seminars. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nRegional Seminars on Anticorruption 2006\u20132007, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", " 4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  \nDesign   Performance Indicators/  Data Sources/ Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact   \n   \n \n\u2022  Improved project  \u2022  Better use of ADB/DMC  \u2022  OAGI\u2019s anticorruption  Assumptions \ndatabase \nimplementation as a  counterpart funds  \u2022  Participants apply what \nresult of reduced risk of  \u2022  Quality of participating  \u2022  Project performance  they have learned to \nfraud and corruption in  bidders and/or  reports  ongoing ADB-financed \nADB-financed activities  contractors  \u2022  Audited project accounts  projects. \n\u2022  Project procurement-  \nrelated audit reports \n\u2022  Participants will continue \n \nto be involved in ADB-\nfinanced projects after \nthe seminar. \n \n\u2022  Participants will \ndisseminate knowledge \nand resource materials \nwith other key DMC \nofficials, specifically those \ninvolved in ADB-financed \nactivities. \n  \nOutcome \n     \n\u2022  Improved quality of  \u2022  OAGI\u2019s anticorruption  Assumptions \n\u2022  Heightened awareness of \nproject implementation  database \nADB\u2019s anticorruption \n\u2022  Participants apply what \npolicy and corruption    \u2022  Project performance \nthey have learned to \ndeterrence procedures    reports   ongoing ADB-financed \n\u2022  Greater knowledge  \u2022  Audited project accounts  projects. \namong DMC officials of  \u2022  Project procurement-  \npolicy applications in \nrelated audit reports  \u2022  Participants will continue \nother countries \nto be involved in ADB-\n \n  financed projects after \nthe seminar \n \n \nOutputs   \n   \n\u2022  Increase reporting to  \u2022  OAGI\u2019s anticorruption \n\u2022  DMC officials trained to  ADB and/or OAGI of \ndatabase \ndetect fraud and  incidence of fraud and \ncorruption in ADB- corruption on ADB- \u2022  Project performance \nfinanced projects   financed activities  reports  \n\u2022  DMC officials aware of    \u2022  Audited project accounts \n\u2022  Early detection of \nADB\u2019s anticorruption \npotential irregularities on  \u2022  Project procurement-\npolicy  \nADB-financed activities   related audit reports \n\u2022  DMC officials   \n \nknowledgeable of other   \nDMCs\u2019 policy application    \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nActivities and Milestones  Inputs \n \n\u2022  ADB financing of $300,000, from ADB\u2019s TA funding \n\u2022  One regional seminar in October 2006 at the ADB \nprogram.
