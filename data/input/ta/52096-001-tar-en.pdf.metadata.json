THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \nA.  Justification \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparatory \nassistance, technical support, policy advice, knowledge sharing, and capacity building to support \nthe implementation of ongoing projects. The TA will strengthen due diligence and improve project \nreadiness to Southeast Asian developing member countries (DMCs) for a series of lending \nprojects and programs identified in the country operations business plans (COBPs), 2018-2020.1 \nThe TA facility will initially support project preparation activities related to (i) Support for a \nSustainable Power Sector (Cambodia); (ii) National Solar Park Project: Capacity Development for \nIncreased  Solar  Generation  (Cambodia);  (iii)  Grid  Reinforcement  Project  for  Expanded \nRenewable Energy Generation Project (Cambodia); and (iv) Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) \nActivity in the Natural Gas Processing Sector (Indonesia).2 These energy sector projects require \nsimilar preparation, due diligence, design and readiness activities and therefore, this TA facility \nwill reduce transaction costs through minimizing the need for stand-alone transaction TAs.  \n \n2.  The TA facility will also provide technical knowledge services and capacity building \nsupport to ongoing projects, such as (i) Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City Power Transmission \nDevelopment Sector project and Power Transmission Investment Program (Tranche 3) (Viet \nNam);3 (ii) Market Transformation Through Introduction of Energy-Efficient Electric Vehicles \nProject  (Philippines);4 and  (iii)  Power  Transmission  Improvement  Project  (Myanmar).5 The \ntransaction TA facility, as funds are added, intends to encompass TA support for ongoing projects \nand the loans and grants listed in the future Southeast Asia region\u2019s COBPs. \n \n3.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region includes rapidly growing \nnational economies predicted to experience energy demand growth by almost two-thirds over the \nnext two decades, representing 10% of the rise in total global energy demand, as the regional \neconomy triples in size and experiences urban population growth of over 150 million people.6 \nEnergy  sector  infrastructure  needs  are  enormous,  with  an  estimated  $2.7  trillion  required \ninvestment in energy supply and efficiency through 2040.7 Out of about 640 million people in the \nregion, an estimated 65 million people (10%) remain without electricity8 and 250 million (40%) \nrely on biomass for cooking9 (footnote 6). Access to modern energy varies significantly among \nthe ASEAN countries, ranging from 26% in Myanmar and 65% in Cambodia up to 100% in the \nregion\u2019s most advanced economies such as Singapore and Malaysia.10  \n                                                \n1  These include Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  Future facility support is also anticipated for the GMS Cross-Border Power Trade and Distribution Project (Lao PDR), \nthe Sustainable Rural Power Supply Project (Philippines), and the Power Network Development Project (Myanmar). \n3  To provide technical support in line with the changing requirements in network planning to integrate renewable energy \non a large scale including adapting new smart grid technologies such as battery energy storage systems and to \nachieve energy efficiency and energy savings using energy services companies. \n4  To provide technical advice to the government on business models for electric vehicles and effective deployment of \nvehicle charging infrastructure for increased electric vehicle use to ensure sustainability of the ongoing project. \n5  To provide support for procurement and financial management and ADB requirements given the weak capacity of \nexecuting and implementing agencies in Myanmar. \n6  International Energy Agency. 2017. Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2017.

The role of the energy sector as a key enabler of inclusive growth has become more \nimportant as the DMCs of Southeast Asia face the challenge of expanding their economies and \nmeeting climate change mitigation targets. Improved access to affordable and sustainable forms \nof energy is critical to enhance competitiveness, to contribute to climate change mitigation, and \nto promote increased economic activity in remote areas and thereby to improve inclusiveness of \ndevelopment. In addition, continued urbanization, rising incomes leading to increased ownership \nof appliances and increased demand for cooling, as well as rapidly growing commercial and \nindustrial activity\u2014 all collectively contribute to electricity being the largest share of total energy \nconsumption growth in the region (footnote 6). In meeting all development needs, however, \nsustainable energy transition should be the main thrust of energy strategies for the DMCs in the \nregion.  \n \n5.  Traditional  challenges  remain  relevant  in  reaching  the  unelectrified  population  and \nmeeting fast growing electricity demand in the region. However, the energy sector landscape is \nrapidly changing, driven by technological innovation and rapid cost reduction in non-hydro \nrenewable energy and clean technologies. The world-wide penetration of solar and wind energy \nin recent years has been remarkable: Costs have been reduced by about 50% compared to 10 \nyears ago and annual capacity additions achieve new records. For example, 62% of net power \ngeneration capacity additions globally came from renewable energy in 2016.11 Electric battery \nand energy storage technologies are becoming more available and affordable as a solution to \nbalance the intermittency of solar and wind power and to improve network reliability and stability. \nIncreasing applications of digital technologies enhance demand response capability and can \ntransform energy systems into more efficient and integrated ones. Solar rooftops, microgrids, and \ndecentralized energy services call for new business models and necessary policy and regulatory \nchanges. In this region, the private sector increasingly plays an important role in  bringing \ninnovation and scaling up investment, while the public sector seeks to improve policies and \nregulatory environments for private sector participation and market-oriented sector development. \nAs such, there are enormous opportunities for developing countries to leapfrog conventional \nbusiness models  and technologies  through  public-private  partnerships  and  other  means  to \nachieve sustainable and cleaner energy development. Experiences in many other countries, \nnotably People\u2019s Republic of China and to a lesser extent in India, show that renewable energy \nis economically competitive with thermal and other generation sources and can expand rapidly \nand with greater flexibility.    \n \n6.  The series of loans and knowledge services identified in the COBPs of the individual \ncountries  within  the  Southeast  Asia  region  represent  the  commitment  of  their  respective \ngovernments to make such a transition in developing their energy sectors. This way, they can \nsupport economic growth, expand and enforce existing electrical grids, connect businesses and \nhouseholds, and enhance the quality of life in unconnected villages across the region. While the \ninvestment and capacity building needs differ among the DMCs in Southeast Asia region, they \nshare common challenges and objectives to expand renewable energy, enhance transmission \nand distribution networks to better manage intermittent renewable energy, and increase energy \nefficiency investments. A successful transition requires significant improvements in the capacity \nof  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in  project  preparation  and  implementation,  and \nknowledge sharing becomes essential so that the governments and utilities can properly and \nquickly  understand  the  availability  and  affordability  of  alternative  clean  and  low  carbon \ntechnologies and continue to electrify those without access to modern energy services. \n \n                                                \n11  REN21. 2017.
