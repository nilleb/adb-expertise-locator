The environmental implications were reviewed and no \nAssessment  significant adverse impacts were identified.  \n   \nRationale  ADB\u2019s CSP identifies power sector restructuring as one of the main \ninterventions for directly impacting the most important development \nconstraints,  such  as  the  fiscal  imbalance  and  poor  investment \nclimate. The restructuring has reached an important juncture. The \nlegal, regulatory, and institutional framework for privatization and \ncompetition is largely in place. However, for the restructuring to \nsucceed,  the  sector\u2019s  financial  viability  has  to  be  restored, \nregulatory performance improved, and the confidence of private \nsector investors enhanced. The Government needs ADB\u2019s support \nin all these areas to consolidate the restructuring process.  \n   \nImportant Features  Based on lessons from previous operations, a cluster approach is \nadopted for the Power Sector Development Program (PSDP). The \ntwo subprograms that form the Program cluster have 2-year time \nhorizons,  one  covering  2007\u20132008  and  the  other  (tentatively) \ncovering 2009\u20132010. Target dates are set only for subprogram 1. \nSubprogram  1\u2019s  accomplishments  will  be  reviewed  as  it \napproaches  completion,  and  the  scope  and  schedule  of \nsubprogram  2  will  be  defined  as  necessary.  This  will  provide \nflexibility in subprogram 2 design, as adjustments can be made \nbased on the results of subprogram 1 and changes in the external \nenvironment. \nThe Program Loan   \n \nImpact and Outcome  The primary objective of the Program cluster loan is to help restore \nthe financial viability of the power sector, and specifically to support \nthe  Government\u2019s  absorption  of  NPC\u2019s  long-term  liabilities.  For \nsubprogram  1  of  the  PSDP,  the  objectives  are  to  (i)  provide \nfinancial  assistance,  through  a  program  loan,  to  help  the \nGovernment meet part of the power sector restructuring costs; (ii) \nestablish the necessary conditions for substantial progress in the \nprivatization program under subprogram 2; (iii) improve confidence \nin regulatory performance; and (iv) ensure a smooth transition to \ncompetitive electricity markets. \n  \nFinancing Plan  The Government requires about $9.2 billion in financing for the \npower  sector  during  2006\u20132010.  The  program  loan  under \n ", "ii     \nsubprogram 1 of the PSDP will cover $450 million of that amount.  \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  To  finance  subprogram  1,  a  loan  of  $450  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London \nInter-bank Offered Rate-based lending facility. The loan will have a \n15 year term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nProgram Period and  The program cluster period is tentatively 4 years from 2007 to \nProgram Cluster  2010, with a single tranche of $450 million to be disbursed under \nsubprogram 1. The scope and amount of subprogram 2 will be \ndetermined after the Government fulfills relevant policy conditions. \n \nExecuting Agency and  The Department of Finance (DOF) is the Executing Agency for the \nImplementation  program  loan,  while  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  is  the \nArrangements  Implementing  Agency.  DOF  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation of the Program, including (i) compliance with policy \nactions, (ii) program administration, (iii) disbursements, and (iv) \nmaintenance of program records. An Energy Executive Committee \nwill  be  formed  to  take  charge  of  PSDP\u2019s  implementation.  The \ncommittee, comprising of officials and executives of DOE, National \nElectrification Administration, National Power Corporation, National \nTransmission  Corporation,  Philippine  Electricity  Market \nCorporation, Philippine National Oil Company, and Power Sector \nAssets and Liabilities Management Corporation will meet at least \nonce a month and monitor the program implementation progress. \nDOE  will  be  responsible  for  the  monitoring  of  the  program \nimplementation activities, and reporting implementation progress. \n \nProcurement, and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The \ndisbursement will be made in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  The period for subprogram 1 will be 2007\u20132008, while the period \nfor subprogram 2 is tentatively 2009\u20132010. \n \nBenefits and  Power sector restructuring will have a significant positive impact in \nBeneficiaries  the  sector,  as  well  as  in  the  economy.  With  the  large-scale \nprivatization and introduction of a competitive electricity market, the \nGovernment\u2019s  role  in  the  power  sector  will  be  curtailed.  The \nGovernment  will  become  a  policy  maker  and  planner;  and  its \nunsustainable subsidies to the power sector will be reduced to \nlevels needed for electrification in unviable rural areas. Thus, a \nmajor fiscal crisis will be averted, and financial resources will be \nfreed up for social services and infrastructure. Restoring financial \n ", "  iii\nviability of the power sector is vital to fiscal consolidation, and will \nbe important in attracting new investments in the power sector. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  While the Government remains committed to power sector reform, \nthe delays in the privatization program have cast doubt on the \nrelevance  of  the  ongoing  power  sector  restructuring.  A  policy \nreversal to return to the previous, vertically integrated Government-\nowned monopoly is a major political risk. This would exacerbate \nthe financial difficulties of the power sector and discourage the \nprivate  participation  that  is  needed  to  ensure  the  long-term \nsustainability  of  the  sector.  The  PSDP  will  provide  essential \nsupport to the Government to ensure that the reform program is on \ntrack. Private investors have perceived ADB\u2019s continued support \nfor power sector reforms as an important factor for the successful \ncompletion  of  the  reforms.  The  proposed  PSDP,  therefore,  will \ncontribute  to  building  much-needed  confidence  among  private \nsector  investors  at  a  critical  juncture  of  the  power  sector \nrestructuring process. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nprogram loan under the Program cluster concept to the Republic of the Philippines for the \nPower Sector Development Program (PSDP). The program design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. The policy matrix is in Appendix 2.  \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  The macroeconomic management priority of the Government of the Philippines (the \nGovernment) is to maintain momentum on fiscal consolidation. This will leave more budget \nresources for economic growth and poverty reduction. Also, progress on deficit reduction has \nemerged as the proxy for financial markets and investors to gauge Government\u2019s commitment, \ncapacity, and credibility to deliver on its broader agenda. In July 2005, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Board endorsed the Philippine country strategy and program 2005\u20132007 (CSP),1 \nwhich proposes significant levels of policy-based support. However, for the Government to \nreceive that assistance, (i) the budget deficit reduction program must be on track, and (ii) sector-\nspecific reform agendas must be in place. These conditions have been met sufficiently. This \nsection concludes that the macroeconomic progress is on track, allowing ADB\u2019s policy-based \nsupport to proceed.  \n \n3.  The erosion of tax collection ratio from 17% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997 to \n12.3% in 2004, when the decline was arrested, was the primary cause of the rapid increase in \nthe  Government  budget  deficit  from  0.1%  of  GDP  in  1997  to  its  peak  of  5.3%  in  2002. \nMeanwhile, escalating losses of nonfinancial Government-owned and -controlled corporations \n(GOCC) during 1999\u20132004\u2014especially in the power sector\u2014increased the consolidated public \nsector deficit as a percentage of GDP.2 Figure 1 summarizes the history of these three trends. \nWeak tax collection meant public development expenditure was financed increasingly from \nborrowings. This increased significantly the Government\u2019s debt stock as a percentage of GDP, \nconsequently almost doubling interest expenses from 16.6% of the budget in 1997 to 31.8% in \n2005 (Figure 2). The increase in mandatory interest expenses reduced discretionary spending. \nCapital outlays as a proportion of budget spending almost halved during 1997\u20132005 (Figure 2), \nwhile  expenditure  on  social  sectors  similarly  fell.  The  Government\u2019s  access  to  official \ndevelopment assistance for investment projects was constrained due to the lack of budget cover \nand counterpart funding. Hence, relatively expensive financing was sourced from international \ncapital markets, feeding back into high debt service commitments. This \u201cvicious circle\u201d needs to \nbe broken to allow public spending for economic growth and poverty reduction.   \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s fiscal consolidation program includes a wide range of initiatives. \nHowever, given the serious impact of undercollection of revenues on economic growth and \npublic service delivery, the primary focus has been on broadening the tax base, increasing tax \nrates, and strengthening tax administration. With a view to front-loading initiatives to increase \ntax collection, excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco were adjusted from January 2005. Further, \nthe coverage of the value-added tax was expanded from November 2005, and the rate was \nincreased from 10% to 12% from February 2006.3 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

To this end, tax administration has been strengthened by the passage of the \nLateral  Attrition  Law  (2005),4 which  provides  for  performance-based  sanctions  (including \nretraining, redeployment, and removal) for employees of revenue-collecting agencies who fall \nshort of revenue targets, and rewards for those who exceed them. Further, focused programs \nhave strengthened tax compliance and enhanced governance of the tax system, including (i) \nBureau of Custom\u2019s Run After the Smugglers program, (ii) Bureau of Internal Revenue\u2019s Run \nAfter Tax Evaders program, and (iii) Department of Finance\u2019s lifestyle checks on officials under \nits Revenue Integrity Protection System. These programs are highly publicized, target well-\nknown personalities, and emphasize the increased risk to officials of tax evasion and corrupt \npractices.  \n \n6.  In 2005, a reduction in the aggregate deficit of GOCCs complemented these revenue \ninitiatives, reversing a worsening trend since 1999. The most significant contribution was from \nincreases in wholesale electricity prices,5 which allowed National Power Corporation (NPC)\u2014\nthe largest contributor to the consolidated deficit\u2014to break even in 2005. NPC\u2019s financial loss \nfell from 2% of GDP in 2004 to almost zero in 2005, assisted by improved NPC operational \nefficiency, Government debt absorption, and appreciation of the peso. Further improvement in \naggregate GOCC financial performance is expected from implementing Executive Order No. \n366 (October 2004), which requires Government departments, agencies, and corporations to \ncomplete  strategic  reviews  to  rationalize  their  functions  and  staffing.  Performance-based \nbudgeting also is being introduced.6 For local governments, the focus is on (i) strengthening \npublic resource management; (ii) improving the cost-effectiveness of service delivery; and (iii) \n                                                 \n4  The  implementing  rules  and  regulations  of  the  law  were  released  on  30  May  2006,  which  will  allow  the \nperformance-based provisions to be implemented from January 2007.  \n5  Depoliticizing tariff adjustments has been a major achievement, aided by strengthening the technical capacity and \nautonomy of the Energy Regulatory Commission, with ADB assistance: ADB. 2004.

These efforts are bearing fruit. Tax revenue increased by 15% in 2005, compared with \naverage annual growth of about 6.8% during 2000\u20132004. For the first time since 1997, the tax \nrevenue increased from 12.3% of GDP in 2004 to 12.6% in 2005, while the Government\u2019s \nbudget deficit declined from 3.8% of GDP in 2004 to 2.7% in 2005\u2014the third successive annual \nimprovement. The Government debt stock, meanwhile, fell from 79% of GDP in 2004 to 72% in \n2005. The outcomes encouraged, and benefited from, more favorable market sentiment in \n2005: (i) foreign direct investment almost tripled (albeit from a low base), (ii) two of the three \nmajor credit rating agencies upgraded their outlooks from negative to stable, (iii) sovereign \nborrowing costs fell,8 and (iv) the peso appreciated against the dollar beginning in the early part \nof the year. These translated into significant debt service savings, which was an important \ncontributor  to  the  emergence  a  \u201cvirtuous  circle\u201d  in  2005.  Staying  the  course  of  reforms \ngenerated improved market sentiment, which in turn generated more favorable conditions for \nachieving macroeconomic targets. \n \n8.  In March 2006, development partners characterized the progress on aggregate fiscal \nconsolidation  as  \u201cimpressive\u201d  during  the  Philippine  Development  Forum  (PDF),  which  also \nassessed the program as broadly on track.9 The emerging trend is better than projected in the \nGovernment\u2019s  Medium  Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010,10 and  the  target  for \nachieving a balanced budget has been advanced from 2010 to 2008.  While this target is \nambitious, development partners consider it achievable. For 2006, the enhanced value-added \ntax revenues are expected to total the equivalent of 1.2% of GDP, while the overall tax effort is \nexpected to improve by 1.9 percentage points, from 12.7% of GDP in 2005 to 14.6% in 2006. \nThe Government\u2019s budget deficit is expected to decline 1.7 percentage points from 2004 to \n2.1% of GDP, while the consolidated public sector deficit is expected to decline 2.7 percentage \npoints to 2.1% of GDP.   \n \n9.  Risks  associated  with  this  scenario  relate  partly  to  the  magnitude,  intensity,  and \nconsistency of effort needed to secure recent gains. For example, the tax revenue target for \n2010 of 17% of GDP\u2014the same level as in 1997\u2014requires an average annual increase of 0.8 \npercentage points. The PDF characterized 2005 as \u201cthe year of tax legislation\u201d and 2006 as \u201cthe \nyear of tax implementation\u201d, underscoring the Government\u2019s need to secure recent gains to \nachieve  its  2010  goal.  Another  consideration  is  the  composition  and  quality  of  fiscal \nconsolidation. The 2 point reduction in the deficit as a percentage of GDP during 2003\u20132005 \ncomprised 1.4 percentage points from expenditure reduction and only 0.6 percentage points \nfrom increased revenue. The PDF cautioned against disproportionate reliance on expenditure \ncuts rather than higher revenue collections and pointed out that a lower budget deficit is not \ninconsistent  with  higher  spending  on  public  infrastructure,  health,  and  education.  The \ncomprehensive  approach  to  fiscal  consolidation,  which  includes  revenue  enhancement, \nimproved public expenditure management, and more efficient service delivery, supports this \nview. The failure of the executive and legislative branches of Government to agree on the year\u2019s \n                                                 \n7  This is supported under several ADB TA grants, including (i) ADB. 2005 Technical Assistance to the Philippines for \nDebt and Risk Management.

Manila (TA \n4778-PHI, approved 3 April, for $1.8 million).  \n8  For example, sovereign borrowing from the international market in January 2006 was secured at 333 basis points \nover US Treasury bonds compared with about 505 basis points a year earlier.   \n9  ADB. 2006. 2006 Philippines Development Forum.

Manila. \n ", "4     \nbudget, resulting in reenactment of the 2005 budget, poses an additional risk in 2006. Thus, \nachieving the 2006 deficit target will be less onerous under the lower spending of last year\u2019s \nbudget, with the possibility of less pressure to improve the tax effort.  \n \n10.  The CSP sets fiscal triggers for policy-based lending. During 2005\u20132007, the primary \ntrigger is a reduction in the projected Government deficit of 0.7 percentage points in terms of \n \nGDP (CSP, Results Framework, Appendix 8) relative to the 2004 baseline. Further, the CSP \nrequires that \u201cactions to achieve the expected reduction in the deficit/GDP ratio will precede \nADB lending operations, rather than actual results of the actions\u201d (footnote 1).  Importantly, the \nCSP notes that, during the period of fiscal consolidation, ADB will provide program support to \nassist  implementation  of  budgetary,  power,  and  related  reforms\u2014as  long  as  the  transition \nremains on track.

THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Performance \n1.  Background \n13.  NPC, a vertically integrated utility set up to generate and transmit electricity, had primary \nresponsibility for those functions in the Philippines until the power sector was restructured in \nFebruary 2002. The restructuring followed the promulgation of the implementing rules and \nregulations for the Electric Power Industry Reform Act 2001 (EPIRA), which the Congress \npassed in June 2001. Prior to the restructuring, NPC and several independent power producers \n(IPP) shared electricity generating functions in the country. Privately owned Manila Electric \nCompany (Meralco), 16 privately owned utilities, 7 municipal systems, and 119 rural electric \ncooperatives carried out electricity distribution. Thirty-five IPPs (about 8,000 megawatt [MW]) \nhave contracts with NPC for the sale of electricity, while three others (about 2,000 MW) have \nthem with Meralco. NPC also owns and operates about 4,500 MW of grid-connected power \ngenerating plants. \n \n14.  Many of the IPPs entered the power sector as part of a Government-supported solution \nto the power crisis that the Philippines experienced in the early 1990s. Severe power shortages \nbrought about by power generating capacity deficits constrained the economy. However, the \nearly IPP contracts, mostly with NPC in 1993 and 1994, included high cost premiums due to the \nperceived investor risks. As such, they undermined NPC\u2019s financial position. NPC\u2019s debt service \nburden also increased due to the lack of Government equity inputs for NPC\u2019s capital expansion \nprograms, as well as the depreciation of the peso against the foreign currencies in NPC\u2019s \nheavily foreign-denominated debt portfolio. NPC\u2019s financial position worsened when the Asian \nfinancial crisis suppressed economic growth and reduced electricity demand in 1997\u20131998, \nleading to a significant surplus of power generating capacity, especially in Luzon. Consequently, \nIPP power generating commitments that were protected by long term take-or-pay contracts12 \n                                                 \n11   PSALM has been created to own and manage the assets and liabilities of National Power Corporation (NPC) and   \nNational Transmission Corporation (TransCo), para. 18. \n12   Contract between NPC and IPPs, whereby the former agrees to purchase from the latter a fixed quantity of \nelectricity for a given price with Government guarantee. Irrespective of the quantity which is finally needed and  \n ", "6     \nwere under-utilized. Thus, NPC\u2019s return on rate base (RORB) and debt service coverage ratio \n(DSCR) in 1997 fell below 8% and 1.0, respectively. \n \n2.  Power Sector Restructuring \n15.  ADB\u2019s involvement with power sector restructuring in the Philippines began in early \n1994, when policy dialogue intensified with NPC, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the \nDepartment of Finance (DOF). Those discussions focused on NPC's deteriorating financial \nperformance, and consequent inability to fund necessary power generation and transmission \nprojects. After the participants agreed that a radical change was needed, NPC provided ADB \nwith  its  in-house  report  entitled  NPC  Privatization  and  Restructuring  Study  for  comment. \nExtensive and lengthy policy dialogue followed with ADB and the sector\u2019s other major funding \nagencies, which also considered NPC\u2019s added financial burden due to the power generation \novercapacity that was emerging as a consequence of the Asian financial crisis. The dialogue led \nto a consensus on initiating a competitive market for electricity in the Philippines. \n \n16.  The objectives of the Government initiated power sector restructuring program include (i) \ncreation of an enabling legal and regulatory environment to support competitive markets in \nelectricity; (ii) restoration of the financial viability of NPC before the introduction of competitive \nmarkets; (iii) unbundling and corporatization of NPC's operations to facilitate the introduction of \ncompetitive markets in electricity; (iv) establishment of the open-access transmission system \nneeded to support a competitive wholesale market for electricity; (v) establishment of open-\naccess  distribution  systems  to  support  competitive  markets  in  electricity  retailing;  (vi) \nimprovement of the operational efficiency of the distribution subsector to enable it to participate \nin competitive markets; (vii) promotion of energy conservation and demand-side management to \nsupplement efficiency gains from competitive markets; (viii) mitigation of the social impact of the \ntransition  to  competitive  markets;  and  (ix)  ensuring  environmentally  sustainable  power \ngeneration.  These  measures  were  expected  to  achieve  greater  operational  and  economic \nefficiency, enhance the inflow of private capital, broaden the ownership base of the power \nsector, and minimize the Government's financial and risk exposure.  \n \n17.  To support the Government\u2019s power sector restructuring program, ADB approved the \nPower Sector Restructuring Program (PSRP), for $300 million, on 16 December 1998.13 In \nDecember 2002, ADB supplemented this loan with a partial credit guarantee (PCG) to help in \nfinancing additional adjustment costs associated with the restructuring.14  The principal objective \nof the PSRP was to restore NPC\u2019s financial viability and create competitive electricity markets \nby  unbundling  generation  and  transmission,  and  providing  open  and  equal  access  to \ntransmission  and  distribution.  The  blueprint  to  achieve  these  objectives  is  EPIRA,  which \nprovides the legal framework for power sector restructuring and the privatization of NPC. The \nimplementing rules and regulations of EPIRA were promulgated in February 2002. A description \nof the power sector institutions and the sector road map is in Appendix 3. The Supplementary \nAppendix provides an extensive and detailed analysis of the energy sector. \n \n18.  The power sector restructuring has achieved the following thus far: \n                                                 \ntransferred, NPC is bound by its commitments and is required to pay for the whole volume of sales at the \ncontractual terms agreed upon. \n13  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n ", "  7\n(i)  NPC\u2019s  integrated  functions  were  unbundled  by  separating  generation  from \ntransmission.   \n(ii)  The  National  Transmission  Corporation  (TransCo)  was  created  to  take  over \nNPC\u2019s transmission assets and operations. \n(iii)  PSALM  was  created  to  (a)  oversee  and  manage  the  privatization  of  NPC\u2019s \ngeneration  assets,  (b)  award  the  concession  for  TransCo\u2019s  transmission \noperations, and (c) take over the debt liabilities and non-transmission assets of \nNPC.15 \n(iv)  An independent Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) was created to set rates \nfor  the  captive  market,16 and  for  transmission  and  distribution,  which  are \nregulated parts of the electricity supply business.  \n(v)  The Philippine Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC) was created to supervise \nthe establishment of the wholesale electricity spot market (WESM), which started \ncommercial operations in June 2006. \n(vi)  The DOE was reorganized to perform its expanded mandate of power sector \nplanning and supervision of power sector restructuring.  \n(vii)  Inter-grid, intra-grid, and inter-class electricity tariff cross-subsidies17 have been \nremoved. \n \n19.  In terms of its objectives, the PSRP was successful in putting in place the legal and \nregulatory framework for the introduction of a competitive market for electricity. Further, the \nPSRP achieved the unbundling of the power generation and transmission functions, with the \nprovision of open access in the transmission and distribution systems required for the working of \na competitive market. The successful start of the WESM on 26 June 2006, and its smooth \noperation as a viable platform for electricity trading, is another measure of success of the PSRP. \nHowever, the restoration of financial viability in the power sector, the substantial privatization of \nNPC\u2019s power generation assets, and the selection of a transmission system concessionaire \nwere not achieved to a significant extent. The capability of the power system to meet expected \ndemand for electricity in the medium term is another area of concern.  \n \nB.  Issues and Options \n1.  PSALM\u2019s Financial Situation  \n20.  The Government\u2019s decision to contract IPPs as a response to the power crisis of the \n1990s (para. 14), and the Asian financial crisis after 1997, resulted in NPC incurring huge \nliabilities.  The  long-standing  liquidity  problem  of  NPC  is  mainly  attributable  to  its  under-\ncapitalization and inadequate tariff adjustments. As a result of its excessive debt and foreign \nexchange exposure, compounded by its high exposure to market and fuel price risk, NPC has \nincurred financial losses since 1998. The failure to effectively address these problems has \nharmed the economy and created a large financial burden on the Government.  \n \n                                                 \n15\n ADB. 2005.

Manila \n(approved on 19 July).  \n16 The captive market refers to electricity consumers who do not have the choice of a supplier of electricity. \n17 Inter-grid cross subsidy refers to a subsidy by Luzon grid to Visayas and Mindanao grids; intra-grid cross subsidy \nrefers to a subsidy by Meralco to other distribution utilities within Luzon grid; inter-class subsidy refers to a subsidy \nby industrial consumers to residential consumers.  \n ", "8     \n21.  As shown in Table 4, the financial position of PSALM (consolidated NPC and TransCo) \ndeteriorated significantly from 2002 to 2003. During this period, PSALM\u2019s IPP lease obligations \nincreased by 20% due to the commissioning of the San Roque hydropower and the Kalayaan 2 \nplants, both of which were committed for construction during the late 1990s. The failure to \nincrease generation rates in 2002 to cover IPP liabilities from existing facilities, as well as those \nof the San Roque and and Kalayaan 2 plants, exacerbated PSALM\u2019s financial problems. By the \nend  of  2003,  PSALM\u2019s  assets  were  less  than  its  accumulated  liabilities,  implying  that  the \ncorporation  was  technically  bankrupt.  In  the  absence  of  a  Government  equity  infusion  or \nsubsidy, PSALM relied on commercial borrowings to refinance its maturing obligations. In 2004 \nand 2005, PSALM borrowed almost $2.2 billion from, among others, the international bond \nmarkets.  \n \nTable 4: PSALM\u2019s (NPC and TransCo) Financial Performance 1998\u20132005 \n(P billion) \n \nResult of Operations \nItem  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nNet Operating Revenues  86.60  89.70  100.10  115.70  116.40  119.20  167.30  165.40 \nOperating Expenses  79.70  81.20  94.70  108.90  115.90  124.50  145.10  143.60 \nOperating Income  6.90  8.50  5.40  6.80  0.50  (5.30)  22.10  21.90 \nInterest Expense  11.00  13.00  15.10  15.10  17.90  24.90  30.20  19.60 \nOther Income (Expense)  0.50  (1.50)  (3.30)  (2.10)  (16.30)  (86.80)c  (21.80)  83.60e \nNet Income (Loss)  (3.60)  (6.00)  (13.00)  (10.40)  (33.70)  (117.00)  (29.90)  86.00 \n \nFinancial Condition \nItem  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nUtility Plantsa  287.10  277.60  273.50  270.10  268.90  268.20  262.80  309.50 \nPlants Under                 \nCapital Lease  166.30  350.90  360.00  367.20  454.70  552.50  528.30  503.50 \nLease                 \nOther Assets  192.70  233.90  356.30  368.70  429.40  169.30  264.90  266.00 \nTotal Assets  646.10  862.40  989.80  1,006.00  1,153.00  990.00  1,056.00  1,079.00 \nLong-Term Debtb  214.00  238.80  292.00  290.10  376.30  461.10  348.60  346.00 \nIPP Lease                 \nObligationsd  230.50  406.20  485.80  505.00  595.10  716.00  680.70  596.10 \nOther Liabilities                 \nand Credits  72.50  92.00  100.90  117.40  120.80  140.10  164.00  158.30 \nTotal Liabilities                 \nand Deferred                 \nCredits  517.00  737.00  878.70  912.50  1,092.20  1,317.20  1,193.30  1,100.40 \n               \nNet Assets  129.10  125.40  111.10  93.50  60.80  (327.20)  (137.30)  (21.40) \n( ) = negative, IPP = independent power producer, NPC = National Power Corporation, P = peso, PSALM = Power \nSector Assets and Liabilities Corporation \na   Depreciated replacement cost of power plants plus construction work in progress. \nb    Includes bond and loan principal net of current portion. \nc    Includes a one-off charge of P78 billion due to a change in the accounting treatment of foreign exchange and IPP \nlosses.

To ease PSALM\u2019s financial burden, the Government exercised the option of assuming \npart of PSALM\u2019s long-term liabilities, as provided for by EPIRA. On 31 December 2004, the \nGovernment assumed a portion of PSALM\u2019s financial obligations, totaling about P200 billion. On \n13 April 2005, ERC issued its final approval for an increase of P1.0353/kilowatt-hour (kWh) in \n ", "  9\npower  generation  base  rate,  effective  from  26  April  2005.  ERC  also  approved  additional \nincreases of P0.4239/kWh through the generation rate adjustment mechanism (GRAM) and \nP0.14/kWh through the incremental currency exchange rate adjustment (ICERA) to recover \nincreasing fuel costs and unfavorable currency fluctuations. \n \n23.  As a result of these financial adjustments, PSALM averted a liquidity crisis and turned \naround its financial position. For the first time in 7 years, PSALM reported a positive net income \n(P7.9 billion) in 2005 before inclusion of foreign exchange gain. After inclusion of a large (non-\ncash) foreign exchange gain (P78 billion), PSALM reported a record high net income of P86 \nbillion in 2005, compared with a record low of P117 billion net loss (including P78 billion of \nforeign exchange loss) in 2003. PSALM\u2019s DSCR, a key indicator of its financial health, improved \nconsiderably to about 0.81 times in 2005, compared with extremely low levels of 0.13 in 2003 \nand 0.15 times in 2004. A sharp reduction of PSALM\u2019s share of the consolidated public sector \ndeficit, from a record high level of 2.0% of GDP in 2004 to an estimated 0.1% in 2005, was \nanother indicator of its improved liquidity position.   \n \n24.  With  further  progress  in  the  power  sector  restructuring  and  privatization,  PSALM\u2019s \nfinancial position would improve due to (i) revenue from the sale of NPC generation facilities, (ii) \nrevenue from the transmission grid concessionaire, (iii) Government\u2019s absorption of any further \nPSALM debt, (iv) revenue from the stranded debt and stranded contract cost portion to be \nincluded in the universal charge levied on all electricity end users for IPP contracts approved by \nthe Government before 31 December 2000, and (v) financial gains from renegotiating IPP \ncontracts. Following EPIRA\u2019s mandate, PSALM has renegotiated substantially 20 of the 35 \ncontracts that NPC has with IPPs, resulting in savings of about $1 billion in discounted present \nvalue terms. However, EPIRA also requires that all outstanding financial obligations of electric \ncooperatives  (EC)  to  National  Electrification  Administration  (NEA)  and  other  Government \nagencies be forgiven and assumed by PSALM, and that the electricity retail rate of each EC be \nreduced by an amount commensurate to the resulting savings.   \n \n2.  Privatization Program \n25.  The PSRP and EPIRA targets for privatizing the eligible NPC power generating plants \nwere optimistic, primarily due to (i) the continuing effects of the Asian financial crisis, which \nconstrained electricity demand growth; and (ii) the rapid private sector implementation of large \nblocks of more environmentally acceptable, natural gas-fired power generating plants in Luzon \nwith Government support. This reduced the utilization of older NPC-contracted IPP power plants \nand NPC\u2019s own power plants until electricity demand rebounded to higher levels. The lack of \nprospective market share in the near term, therefore, limited investor interest in bidding for \neligible NPC power generating plants in the last few years. However, steadily growing electricity \ndemand, the Government\u2019s vigorous efforts to associate transition supply contracts to eligible \nNPC power generating plants, and the initial operations of the WESM are stimulating greater \nprivate sector interest in acquiring eligible NPC power generating plants. Further strengthening \nof ERC under the PSDP also will help allay private sector perceptions of regulatory and country \nrisks. \n \n26.  Some general factors also have hampered the ongoing privatization program. First, \nsince the adoption of EPIRA and the start of the privatization program, many US and European \ninvestors in the power sector have encountered serious financial difficulties, while others have \nscaled down their investment particularly in developing countries. The commercial lenders that \nsuffered losses from their investments in the 1990s also have reduced their exposure to the \npower sector. In addition to these external factors that affected all emerging markets, investors \n ", "10    \nperceive the country and regulatory risks associated with political events in the Philippines to be \nhigh. Although the ERC has been making steady progress in fulfilling its mandate under EPIRA, \nseveral of its decisions have been challenged and reversed by the Supreme Court based on \nprocedural  lapses.18 These  judicial  interventions  affect  investors\u2019  confidence  in  the  new \nregulatory framework.  \n \n27.  In  countries  that  have  successfully  implemented  privatization  of  generation  assets, \nbilateral supply contracts19 generally were attached to these assets to provide a viable market \nfor investors and a bankable project for lenders. Without such contracts, investors are unable to \nmobilize  long-term  financing  from  commercial  banks.  Concluding  such  bilateral  contracts \nbetween power generation plants and distribution utilities (DU) is relatively easy when both \nparties  are  initially  government-owned.  In  the  Philippines,  however,  the  private  sector \ntraditionally has owned DUs, which are not compelled under EPIRA to sign long-term bilateral \nsupply contracts with NPC\u2019s power plants. Since EPIRA envisages the introduction of retail \ncompetition for large consumers with demand over 1 MW, DUs might face competition for such \nconsumers and even lose part of the business in their franchise areas. For example, with the \nprospect of losing its monopoly in its franchise area, Meralco\u2014accounting for 56% of national \nelectricity sales\u2014has refused to enter into a bilateral supply contract with NPC. Even if Meralco \nand/or some DUs enter into bilateral contracts, potential investors for generation assets still will \nneed to assess the credit risk of these electricity offtakers.20 This is particularly important if the \nofftaker is an EC. 21 The recent decision by Mirant Corporation, 22  the largest IPP investor in the \nPhilippines,  to  sell  its  assets  in  the  country  also  creates  serious  competition  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s privatization program, since Mirant\u2019s IPPs will retain their original Government-\nguaranteed bilateral contracts for electricity sales. \n \n28.  The EPIRA target was the privatization of 70% of NPC\u2019s eligible capacity in Luzon and \nVisayas by June 2004. Seven hydroelectric power plants, with a combined rated capacity of \n115.4 MW, have been auctioned off (for $134 million)\u2014i.e., only 2.7% of the 4,336 MW of \neligible generation assets for privatization. The bidding for the 360 MW Magat Hydroelectric \nPower Plant is scheduled before the end of 2006. The bidding for the 600 MW coal-fired \nMasinloc  Thermal  Power  Plant  failed  because  the  winning  bidder  was  unable  to  secure \nfinancing for its purchase in the absence of a bilateral supply contract. Similarly, the bidding for \nthe 600 MW Calaca Thermal Power Plant failed because the best offer did not meet the \nGovernment\u2019s reserve (minimum expected) price. PSALM is negotiating bilateral contracts to be \n                                                 \n18 As an example, on 16 August 2006, the Supreme Court declared invalid the ERC\u2019s approval of Meralco\u2019s tariff \nadjustment for the recovery of its purchase cost under GRAM, because the adjustment was not published for public \nconsultation. \n19 A bilateral contract is a contract between a generator and a purchaser for a market-trading period to supply a \nspecific quantity of electricity at a quoted price. If the market price for that period is higher than the quoted price, \nthe generator will refund the difference to the purchaser; if the quoted price is higher than the market price, the \npurchaser will refund the difference to the generator.  \n20 Meralco\u2019s Foreign Currency Corporate Credit Rating by Standard & Poor\u2019s suffered nine downgrades in the last 4 \nyears, from BB+ in 1999 to CC in 2003. As one of the major creditors of Meralco, ADB has granted the necessary \nconsents and waivers, allowing Meralco to refinance its short-term unsecured debt liabilities of $228 million \nmaturing in 2004\u20132006 with a 7-year secured loan facility under a comprehensive liability management plan. \nSubsequently, Standard & Poor\u2019s raised its long-term credit rating on Meralco to B- in February 2005.  \n21 Including Meralco, the Philippines has 19 investor-owned utilities (81% of countrywide retail sales) and 120 \ncustomer-owned ECs (19% of countrywide retail sales). These are classified into four categories: A\u2013creditworthy, \nfinancially self-sufficient (about 25% of the DUs); B\u2013partially creditworthy, large size and density, with potential \nefficiency gains (about 10%); C\u2013marginal viability, unable to attract private financing (about 35%); and D\u2013\nnonviable, operating in low-density and disadvantaged areas (about 30%). \n22 Mirant Philippines assets include the 1,218 MW coal fired power plant in Sual, Pangasinan; the 735 MW coal-fired \npower plant in Pagbilao, Quezon; and a 20% share in the 1,200 MW Ilijan natural gas facility in Batangas. \n ", "  11\nassigned to each plant eligible for privatization, and rebidding the Masinloc and Calaca plants in \nlight of the lessons from the failed bids. The demonstrated satisfactory operation of the WESM \nprovides an incentive for investors to sell at least part of the output from an electricity generation \nproject, and also will make investors factor in project location advantages in the grid for future \ndispatch and market share. For DUs (including Meralco), the potential price volatilities of the \nWESM will be an incentive for them to enter into bilateral contracts with power generators.  \n \n29.  For  the  TransCo  concession,  two  auctions  failed  due  to  an  insufficient  number  of \nqualified bidders.23 In accordance with EPIRA, the private concessionaire of TransCo will need \nto obtain from Congress a national franchise to operate the transmission facilities. However, \nCongress has refused to grant such a franchise to a future concessionaire without knowing its \nidentity, i.e., before the selection process is completed. In May 2006, PSALM launched a third \nround of bidding, and received 12 expressions of interest. In September 2006, three consortia of \nbidders submitted prequalification documents. In contrast to the previous two rounds of bidding, \na new concession structure has been adopted that will require financial closing only after \nCongress grants a franchise. Although time-consuming, this structure will reduce regulatory \nrisks  to  the  investor.24 Along  with  ADB,  the  World  Bank  and  the  International  Finance \nCorporation have announced their intention to provide political risk guarantee and/or funding for \nthe bidders. The bid opening is scheduled on 20 December 2006. \n \n3.  Transition to Competitive Markets \n \n30.  The WESM, established with ADB financing, 25 began commercial operations on 26 June \n2006 with several important risk mitigation measures in place. These include (i) the stipulation of \nbid caps on wholesale electricity spot prices to arrest abnormal volatility and consequent market \ninstability; (ii) the establishment of a tripartite market monitoring committee, comprising ERC, \nDOE, and PEMC; and (iii) the designation of NPC and PSALM as default wholesale suppliers to \nthose bulk offtakers of grid electricity that might have difficulty in directly participating in the \nWESM. These actions will enhance the credibility of the WESM. \n \n31.  While the privatization is in progress, PSALM and NPC are assuming on a transitional \nbasis the trading role in WESM for NPC-contracted IPP electricity generating plants and NPC\u2019s \nown generating plants. PSALM has established four trading teams, representing the four groups \nof NPC-contracted IPP generating plants proposed to be allocated later to IPP administrators.  \nNPC  also  has  established  nine  trading  teams  for  its  own  power  stations.  While  these \narrangements try to simulate the electricity trading structure that should exist at the end of \nprivatization, the reality is that all trading affects the same public participants (PSALM and \nNPC).  Moreover,  NPC  procures  all  fuel  and  coordinates maintenance  for  all  power  plants \nincluding IPPs. Therefore, the private sector and investors might perceive these arrangements \n                                                 \n23 The first bidding in July 2003 failed as only one party, Singapore Power, submitted a pre-qualification proposal. The \nsecond bidding held in August 2004 also failed as only the same party submitted an Expression of Interest.  \n24 Originally, the Government decided to proceed with a two-phase approach for TransCo\u2019s privatization. Phase 1 \nwould commence upon award of the concession to the winning bidder. At that time, the concessionaire would \nassume responsibility for the functions of repair, maintenance, expansion, construction, and financing of the \ntransmission network. As the franchise for operation of a public utility would be with TransCo during phase 1, the \nnon-delegable functions (e.g., monitoring and control of the transmission system, and filing of rates with the ERC) \nwould remain with TransCo. Phase 2 would commence when Congress awards a franchise to the concessionaire, \nafter which the concessionaire would take over all the operational functions of TransCo.  \n25 ADB. 2002.

Manila \n(Loan 1984-PHI). \n ", "12    \nas \u201ccoordinated trading.\u201d26 In August 2006, ERC addressed the structural issues arising from the \ndominant  position  of  PSALM  and  NPC  in  generation,  and  Meralco  in  distribution,  by \npromulgating competition rules and complaint response procedures to ensure fair competition.  \n \n4.  Security of Supply \n32.  In the short term, the Philippines does not face a risk of a countrywide electricity supply \nshortage, as experienced in the early 1990s. The tables in Appendix 4 show the electricity \ndemand  forecasts  for  each  of  the  three  main  grids  in  the  country  (Luzon,  Visayas,  and \nMindanao).  Based  on  the  forecast  demand  growth  rate,  Luzon  will  need  new  generation \ncapacity around 2012 to provide adequate capacity margin. The supply situation in the Visayas \nis  more  acute,  with  additional  generation  capacity  required  in  2009.  In  August  2006,  a \nconsortium  of  foreign  investors  entered  into  an  agreement  with  NPC,  which  acts  as  an \naggregator of the power demand of various DUs, to build a 200 MW coal-fired power plant in \nCebu for commissioning in 2009. In Mindanao, commissioning of the 200 MW Mindanao coal-\nfired power plant in January 2007 will alleviate the electricity supply situation for about 2 years \nto 2009.  \n \n33.  Therefore, increased private sector participation in power generation clearly is needed, \nparticularly since EPIRA does not provide for a default investor for power generation, and NPC \nis prohibited from providing new power generating capacity or purchasing power through new \nbilateral contracts from IPPs. However, the open access power transmission and distribution \nenvisaged under EPIRA enables private sector power generators to provide electricity to the \nmarket of DUs and eligible retail customers. ERC needs to facilitate this mode of bridging supply \nand demand. The mechanisms and measures under EPIRA should improve the investment \nclimate and create conditions that promote generation investment to ensure power supply in the \ncountry.  However,  these  measures  cannot  guarantee  adequate,  market-driven  generation \ninvestment.  For  this  reason,  DOE  will  maintain  a  contingency  plan  that  defines  the \nGovernment\u2019s  responsibility  to  ensure  generation  adequacy  if  generation  investment  is \ninsufficient (para. 59). \n \nC.  Lessons \n34.  The Philippines is among the first ADB developing member countries to implement \nfundamental power sector restructuring, with substantive privatization of generation assets and \nconcessionaire agreements with private parties to operate transmission assets, to achieve a \ncompetitive market for electricity. In the prevailing economic environment, this is an ambitious \nand  complex  task  that  involves  coordinated  actions  on  legislative,  regulatory,  and  policy \nmeasures spread over a reasonably long period. A more appropriate modality for fundamental \npower sector restructuring of the magnitude envisaged under the PSRP would have been a \ncluster approach, which would have prioritized and sequenced the reforms more realistically in \nphases. In the first phase, the PSRP could have concentrated on establishing a sound policy, \nlegal, and regulatory framework to introduce a competitive market. Laying the ground work for \nthe  transfer  of  assets,  privatization,  and  absorption  of  stranded  debt  could  have  been \naccomplished in subsequent phases.  \n \n35.  Therefore,  one  important  lesson  is  that  power  sector  restructuring  in  developing \ncountries is a long process. As such, the design of policy reforms should recognize the need for \na  steady  approach  with  a  phased  and  realistic  implementation  schedule.  The  PSRP,  as \n                                                 \n26 The allegation of price manipulation by PSALM in October 2006 was an illustration of such concerns.  \n ", "  13\ndesigned in 1998, underestimated the complexities of the prevailing investment climate\u2014judicial \nand regulatory\u2014which plays a significant role in privatization of power entities. Further, the \nlegislative  branch  in  the  Philippines  has  some  unique  characteristics  that  can  make  any \nimportant decision a lengthy process. The investment climate also has been affected by the \njudiciary overruling ERC rulings and weak contract enforcement, as manifested in some private \nsector deals involving public utilities. As such, adequate regulatory independence and broader \nimprovements in governance of the judicial system must be ensured for power reforms to move \nahead in a timely manner.  \n \n36.  Most of these findings have been mirrored in the recent evaluation of the PSRP in the \nPhilippines.27 The policy matrix of the PSRP included 60 actions and measures to be completed \nby the Government within 3 years. In April 2004, the evaluation by the Program Completion \nReview found a high level of formal compliance, with 80% of those measures fully implemented \nand 20% partly implemented. The legal, regulatory, and institutional framework largely was \nestablished; NPC was unbundled and corporatized; and the preparations for privatization and \nwholesale competition were advanced. However, the objectives of making the sector financially \nviable, and privatizing NPC\u2019s assets were not achieved. In addition, ERC\u2019s technical expertise \nunder the new regulatory regime raised concerns.  \n \n37.  Theoretically, timely privatization of generation and transmission assets ought to reduce \nfinancial  difficulties  of  public  sector  power  utilities  and  ease  government  budget  pressure. \nHowever, the PSRP underestimated the nexus between the public sector liabilities and high \nfiscal deficit, which impacted the ability to meet adjustment costs. As a result, the progress of \npower sector restructuring was slowed. Over the past few years, inefficiencies of Government-\nowned corporations have perpetuated the fiscal deficit and eroded the Government\u2019s ability to \nfinance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  of  power  entities.  Such  financing  is  essential  to \nfacilitating privatization and restoring power sector financial sustainability. As such, future power \nsector operations should recognize the nexus and complexities of debt resolution of state \nenterprises at a time of high and unsustainable fiscal deficits. In the Philippines, the fiscal deficit \nwill continue to impede the prospects of an early absorption of NPC\u2019s stranded debt, which in \nturn constrains the ability of PSALM to raise resources at competitive prices. Moreover, the \nrestructuring cost should take into account the possible timing mismatch between cash inflows \nfrom the expected privatization revenues and cash outflows, particularly in the initial years.  \n \n38.  In particular, preparation of the PSDP benefited from the Sector Assistance Program \nEvaluation (SAPE) 28 of ADB\u2019s assistance to the Philippines\u2019 power sector. The SAPE provided \na comprehensive and independent assessment of ADB\u2019s assistance to the sector, and identified \nlessons  and  areas  where  ADB  could  work  more  effectively  to  achieve  its  development \nobjectives. With the sector reforms at a critical transition phase, and the sector still needing a \nhuge amount of liquidity to meet its financial obligations, SAPE concluded that ADB should not \ncease support. In terms of future assistance in the power sector, SAPE recommended that ADB \n(i)  support  sector  reforms  through  policy-based  lending  and  technical  assistance  (TA);  (ii) \nrestrict public sector lending to solvent entities, and avoid supporting projects that increase \nfinancial losses and indebtedness; and (iii) support private sector participation in the power \nsector through improved governance and transparency. Accordingly, the proposed PSDP will \nprovide policy-based lending to assist the Government\u2019s reform agenda and facilitate private \nsector investment. \n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2004.

Important lessons also can be derived from ADB\u2019s overall experience with policy-based \nadjustment lending in the Asia and Pacific region. A special evaluation study29 called for greater \nflexibility in program design by considering the standard two-tranche design with a relatively \nshort implementation period, as well as options with single tranche and program clusters\u2014the \nlatter allowing a process approach rather than a blueprint approach. The study pointed out the \nimportance of political economy factors, such as (i) the commitment to, and the timing of, the \nreform; (ii) the length of the government tenure; and (iii) the extent of the crisis. An evaluation of \nADB operations in the Philippines30 also emphasized the importance of such factors, concluding \nthat flexibility in implementation schedules was essential for program lending to allow for the \nimpact of political economy factors.  \n \nD.  External Assistance and Funding Agency Coordination \n40.  ADB is the lead official development partner in the energy sector, with a focus on the \nelectricity subsector. Since 1971, ADB has provided 28 loans with a combined amount of $2.3 \nbillion to the energy sector. This has included 20 loans to NPC, guaranteed by the Government, \nwith a combined value of $1.6 billion. In addition to lending, ADB provided two PCGs to help \nNPC raise long-term funds totaling $642 million. ADB has also provided 34 TA grants to the \nenergy sector with a combined value of $15 million, covering areas such as (i) coal industry \ndevelopment, (ii) rural electrification, (iii) energy conservation, (iv) tariff and pricing studies, (v) \nregulation, (vi) consumer impact assessment, (vii) geothermal steam and natural gas pricing \nstudies,  (viii)  power  development  planning,  (ix)  feasibility  studies,  and  (x)  environmental \nassessments. A list of ADB assistance to the energy sector is in Appendix 5. \n \n41.  The World Bank also has been active in the power sector. To improve coordination of \nADB- and World Bank-assisted operations, ADB and the World Bank reached an understanding \nin 1998 on the division of responsibility in the power sector. According to this understanding, \nADB  would  take  the  lead  in  providing  policy  advice  to  the  Government  on  power  sector \nrestructuring, while continuing support to NPC before its privatization. The World Bank would \nassume a more prominent role in rural electrification programs. Other major multilateral and \nbilateral agencies involved in the sector include the Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n(JBIC), the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the United States (US) Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation, and the US Agency for International Development. ADB has been \ncoordinating its assistance to the sector with other agencies, particularly the World Bank and \nJBIC. A summary of major external assistance to the power sector is in Appendix 6. \n \n42.  In preparing the PSDP, ADB, JBIC, the World Bank, DOE, and other Government \nagencies held several meetings to ensure the close coordination of external support for the \npower sector reform agenda. Given ADB\u2019s history of support for power sector reforms in the \nPhilippines, and the comprehensive program that it has designed with Government agencies in \nrecent months (as reflected in the PSDP), the Government considered it appropriate for ADB to \ncontinue its lead role, at the same time welcoming continuation of the strong support from other \ndevelopment partners. ADB and other development partners are strongly aligned on the overall \nreform agenda, and on the need to restore financial health of PSALM and facilitate privatization. \nThe development partners also share an understanding of the urgency for power sector reforms \nto support the Government\u2019s broader task of fiscal consolidation, which is the primary focus for \nmacroeconomic  management.  The  World  Bank  is  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nconsolidation through a development policy loan (DPL), which includes a component to support \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2001.

The World Bank also approved a TA grant to complement ADB\u2019s assistance, \n31 and is considering a partial risk guarantee for the private concessionaire of TransCo (para. \n29).    \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale, Objective, and Assistance Modality \n43.  ADB\u2019s CSP 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines (footnote 1) identifies power sector reform as \none of the main interventions for directly impacting the most important development constraints, \nsuch as the fiscal imbalance and poor investment climate. As the lead financing agency in the \nsector, ADB has continued to conduct policy dialogue, as well as review and monitor the power \nsector reform and privatization process. While recognizing the main issues and challenges, ADB \ncontinues to support the broad direction for power sector restructuring.  \n \n44.  The  restructuring  has  reached  an  important  juncture.  The  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional framework for privatization and competition is largely in place. However, for the \nrestructuring  to  succeed,  the  sector\u2019s  financial  viability  has  to  be  restored,  regulatory \nperformance  improved,  and  the  confidence  of  private  sector  investors  enhanced.  The \nGovernment needs ADB\u2019s support in all these areas to consolidate the restructuring process. \nDespite the commitment demonstrated by the Government to honor existing IPP contracts, the \nprivate  sector  is  still  cautious  about  investing  large  funds  in  the  power  sector  due  to  the \nperceived political, regulatory, and commercial risks. The Government has requested additional \nADB assistance for the sector restructuring to (i) correct the long-term financial problems of the \nsector, (ii) strengthen the regulatory performance, (iii) enhance conditions for privatization, and \n(iv) improve public confidence in the reforms. \n \n45.  The goal of the PSDP is a financially sustainable, efficient, and secure power supply that \narrests the power sector\u2019s drain on the Government\u2019s finances, freeing up resources for the \nsocial sectors, and minimizes the risk of power shortages that would impede economic growth.  \n \n46.  Because of uncertainties about the scope and completion dates of some actions that are \nbeyond the direct control of the Government, a program cluster consisting of two subprograms \nis proposed. The lessons from the PSRP with regard to the design of a reform program are \nclear: (i) the program should cover only areas directly relevant to its objectives, (ii) an overly \ncomplex policy matrix with too many measures should be avoided, (iii) the measures should be \nobjective- rather than action-oriented, (iv) the schedule for program implementation should be \nrealistic, and (v) a longer time frame should be factored in where measures beyond government \ncontrol are needed (e.g., legislative changes). Lessons (i)\u2013(iii) are reflected in the policy matrix \n(Appendix 2), while lessons (iv) and (v) are taken into account by following a cluster approach \n(i.e., subprogram 1 and subprogram 2). The two subprograms have 2-year time horizons, \ncovering 2007\u20132008 and tentatively 2009\u20132010. Target dates are set only for subprogram 1 to \nallow  flexibility  in  the  overall  implementation  schedule.  As  subprogram  1  approaches \ncompletion, its accomplishments will be reviewed. The results will help define the scope and \nschedule of subprogram 2. This flexibility in program design will allow adjustments to be made \nbased on the results of subprogram 1 and changes in the external environment. \n \n                                                 \n31 World Bank. 2006. Philippines: Preparation of Private Sector Development Support/Guarantee for Power Sector \nReform Project. Washington, DC.  \n ", "16    \n47.  For subprogram 1 of the PSDP, the objectives are to (i) provide financial assistance, \nthrough a program loan, to help the Government meet part of the power sector restructuring \ncosts; (ii) establish the necessary conditions for substantial progress in the privatization program \nunder subprogram 2; (iii) improve confidence in regulatory performance; and (iv) ensure a \nsmooth transition to competitive markets. Since the financial recovery of the power sector is \nessential to fiscal consolidation, the upfront actions of the PSDP\u2014such as the increase in \nNPC\u2019s generation tariff and the Government\u2019s assumption of P200 billion of NPC\u2019s debt\u2014are \namong the first important steps to restore the power sector\u2019s financial viability. Effective and \ntimely implementation of the PSDP will lead to a reliable and financially sustainable power \nsector, while contributing to the Government\u2019s fiscal consolidation.  \n \n48.  Tentatively, subprogram 2 may include a PCG to support PSALM\u2019s debt management, \nand political risk guarantee (PRG) to facilitate private sector investment in power generation and \ntransmission. ADB expects to leverage its own resources by cooperating with commercial and \nofficial political risk insurers through the use of coinsurance and reinsurance. ADB might require \na counter-indemnity or other assurance from the Government, depending on the level of risk \nassociated with the contractual obligations and commitments it has been asked to guarantee.   \n \nB.  Policy Framework \n49.  The policy matrix (Appendix 2) describes the main policy actions necessary to achieve \nthe PSDP\u2019s objective: (i) ensuring financial viability of the power sector, (ii) strengthening the \nsector regulatory framework, (iii) restructuring the market towards competition, (iv) promoting \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  power  sector,  and  (v)  enhancing  consumer  welfare  and \nprotection.  \n \n1.  Financial Viability of the Power Sector \n50.  The main actions required to improve the financial viability of the power sector will focus \non (i) timely tariff adjustment to reflect fuel cost and foreign currency fluctuations, coupled with \nNPC  and  TransCo  capital  expenditure  prioritization  and  operating  cost  control;  (ii)  use  of \nprivatization proceeds to reduce borrowings; (iii) introduction of a universal charge component in \nthe power tariff to cover stranded costs and debt; (iv) liability management and debt refinancing \non  more  favorable  terms;  (v)  Government  payment  to  PSALM  for  non-power  cost  of \nmultipurpose projects; and (vi)  appropriate budgetary assistance for PSALM  to achieve a \nDSCR of at least 1.0 by the end of 2009. In particular, the introduction of the universal charge \nmust be achieved before the processing of subprogram 2. Subprogram 2 may include a PCG to \nassist PSALM\u2019s debt management program, and help meet the debt repayment peak around \n2009\u20132010. \n \n51.  In addition to justifiable adjustments in the average tariff levels, the tariff structure needs \nto be modified to reflect more accurately the cost of supplying electricity at different times of \nday, in different grids, and to different consumer classes. ERC took the first step by approving \ntime-of-use (TOU) tariffs at the generation level,32 which NPC will charge to the DUs and its \nlarge direct consumers. This will be followed by the introduction of TOU pricing at the retail level \nfor consumers with a peak demand of at least 1MW, initially in Meralco\u2019s franchise area through \na customer choice program. By providing the right signals to such consumers, they will reduce \n                                                 \n32 The cost of supplying electricity is highest during the peak load period, because new generation capacity would be \nrequired if the demand were to exceed the available capacity. On the other hand, the cost of supply is as low as the \nincremental fuel costs during the low load period at night. The TOU tariffs will benefit large consumers who have \nthe ability to shift load to off-peak periods. \n ", "  17\ntheir demand during peak hours, curtailing the need for additional capacity. Another measure for \nrestoring the financial viability is the removal of cross-subsidies. Inter-grid and intra-grid cross-\nsubsidies have been removed. The removal of the remaining inter-class cross-subsidies33\u2014\nfrom large industrial and commercial consumers to residential consumers\u2014is in progress to \nprovide the right price signals. \n \n52.  Given the large number of ECs, and their technical and financial problems, an approach \nneeds  to  be  developed,  and  guidelines  issued,  for  improving  their  efficiency  and  financial \nviability.  This  can  be  done  through  operational  and  structural  reforms,  such  as  merger, \nconsolidation,  integration,  and  bulk  procurement.  Action  under  subprogram  1  requires  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to strengthen financially weak electricity offtakers, especially ECs, \nwith tariff rationalization and mandatory restructuring. \n \n2.  Regulatory Framework and Performance \n53.  The  success  of  restructuring  will  depend  to  a  large  extent  on  public  and  investor \nconfidence in sector regulation. This confidence will be based on perceptions of ERC\u2019s technical \nexpertise, efficiency, regulatory consistency, and susceptibility to political and other pressure. \nEffective  sector  regulation  also  relies  on  the  competence  and  reliability  of  other  sector \nparticipants. If regulated entities fail to submit requests for tariff adjustments, or do so with \nincomplete or inaccurate data, ERC will be unable to act, will act with incomplete information, or \nwill be forced to delay proceedings while waiting for the parties to complete the information.  \n \n54.  The  proposed  PSDP  will  not  provide  institutional  development  and  capacity \nenhancement assistance to public and private sector participants. Clear guidance and discipline \nfrom ERC is expected to promote improvement in their performance. The proposed PSDP and \nongoing TA34 will support ERC\u2019s institutional development, and organizational efficiency and \neffectiveness. They will support ERC\u2019s ability to (i) respond efficiently and fairly to regulatory \ndemands; (ii) continuously improve its technical competence; and (iii) communicate clearly and \neffectively on regulatory matters with the public, regulated parties, and investors. Further, the \npolicy actions in the PSDP also support ERC\u2019s administrative autonomy, through the use of \nindependent counsel, and its financial autonomy, through the use of fees levied from regulated \nutilities. \n \n55.  Several of ERC\u2019s decisions have been challenged and reversed on procedural bases, \nwhich is not surprising given the breadth, complexity and political sensitivity of ERC\u2019s tasks. \nERC is making steady progress in fulfilling its mandate under EPIRA. In particular, under the \nongoing ADB TA (footnote 31), ERC has promulgated Rules of Practice and Procedure to \nimprove  the  efficiency,  transparency,  consistency,  and  predictability  of  its  hearing  and \ninvestigative  procedures.  Through  nationwide  public  consultations,  and  the  posting  of  its \ndecisions and guidelines on a Web site, ERC has enhanced the transparency of its decisions. \nThese efforts and improvements will reduce significantly the scope for judicial interventions on \nprocedural grounds. \n  \n                                                 \n33 ERC has begun removing inter-class cross-subsidies for ECs. On 8 October 2004, ERC approved a two-phase \nremoval of such cross-subsidies for customers of Meralco. \n34 ADB. 2004.

The  WESM  began \ncommercial operations on 26 June 2006 in the Luzon grid (paras. 30 and 31) and its operations \nare expected to be expanded to the Visayas grid in 2007, if warranted by the initial experience \nin Luzon and the power supply situation in those areas. The WESM will (i) provide appropriate \nprice  signals  for  capacity  additions  and  demand-side  management,  (ii)  ensure  optimal \nscheduling of power plants, (iii) reduce the need for regulation at the generation level, and (iv) \ncontribute  to  greater  private  sector  participation  and  competition  in  power  generation  and \nsupply. In the long run, this will reduce the Government\u2019s involvement in power generation and \nsupply.  \n \n57.  With more than 40% of electricity sales in Luzon traded through the WESM, wholesale \nelectricity prices declined during the first two months of WESM operations. However, market \nparticipants also face potentially higher risks as demonstrated by the recently rising WESM \nprices. Signing of bilateral contracts with a power generator will provide a hedge against price \nvolatility, as well as ensure a more stable power supply. For power plants that are not yet \nprivatized, PSALM will assign transition supply contracts (TSC), signed between NPC and DUs \n(or other purchasers) and approved by the ERC. These TSCs can be converted into bilateral \ncontracts  with  the  new  plant  owners,  who  can  transit  smoothly  to  the  WESM.  However, \nmeasures  are  needed  to  ensure  the  creditworthiness  of  DUs  (or  purchasers).  This  would \ngenerate  confidence  among  generators  that  the  DUs  will  be  able  to  meet  their  financial \ncommitments.  \n \n58.  Under subprogram 2, the WESM will be expanded to Mindanao, if warranted by the \nexperience in Luzon and Visayas under subprogram 1 and the power supply situation. Also \nunder subprogram 2, retail competition will start, initially only for consumers with a peak demand \nof at least 1MW. This will increase efficiency in the downstream segment of the power supply \nchain, as pressure will be exerted on DUs to keep their tariffs low for such consumers by (i) \nreducing  system  losses,  (ii)  removing  inter-class  cross-subsidies,  and  (iii)  optimizing  their \nwholesale  power  purchase  contracting.  Following  the  experience  gathered  with  retail \ncompetition for such large consumers, the benefits and costs of expanding the competition to \nresidential  and  other  small  consumers  will  need  to  be  assessed,  taking  into  account  the \nexperience of other, more advanced competitive foreign markets. \n \n59.  The  length  of  the  transition  period  until  the  market  functions  properly  and  induces \ncapacity additions by the private sector is difficult to estimate. To ensure a reliable power supply \nduring this period, the Government must be ready to play a backstop role, when necessary. As \nthe WESM is being implemented for the first time in the Philippines, the Government, through \nDOE, will prepare a contingency plan and information program that examines conventional \nsupply, demand-side, and distributed generation options to ensure a reliable power supply in \naccordance with EPIRA,35 without disrupting the development of a competitive energy market. \nThis  should  include  publication  of  information  needed  for  investment  decisions,  such  as \nforecasts of the demand-supply balance, sector planning, and business opportunities. \n \n                                                 \n35 Section 71 of EPIRA stipulates: \u201cUpon the determination by the President of the Philippines of an imminent \nshortage of the supply of electricity, Congress may authorize, through a joint resolution, the establishment of \nadditional generating capacity under such terms and conditions as it may approve.\u201d \n ", "  19\n4.  Private Participation in Power Generation and Transmission \n60.  The priority actions to be pursued by PSALM to increase private sector participation \ninclude:  \n(i)  completing the negotiations on TSCs between NPC and the DUs to facilitate the \nongoing process of bidding out NPC generation capacity to the private sector;  \n(ii)  initiating  a  customer  choice  program  to  allow  direct  contracting  between \ngenerators and large customers (those with a demand over 1 MW); and  \n(iii)  introducing  regulatory  requirements  and  incentives  for  electricity  offtakers  to \nenter into TSCs by imposing a premium on sale prices for DUs that rely on \ndefault wholesale supplier arrangements without such contracts. \n \n61.  Given the numerous factors that can affect the timely implementation of the privatization \nprogram, subprogram 1 does not include specific targets for selling a significant part of NPC\u2019s \ngeneration  capacity.  Instead,  it  focuses  on  enhancing  the  necessary  conditions  for \nimplementation of the privatization program. The sale of NPC\u2019s generation capacity would \ncontinue under subprogram 2. To achieve the envisaged large-scale private participation in \npower  generation  and  transmission,  DOE  will  make  available  adequate  and  consistent \ninformation needed for investment decisions. This applies to the various documents on sector \nplanning, such as the Philippine Energy Plan, Power Development Program, and Transmission \nDevelopment Plan. DOE also must provide information on project opportunities, specifying main \nproject parameters, such as recommended location, capacity, fuel, and timing. \n \n5.  Consumer Welfare and Protection \n62.  The success of the power sector restructuring will depend on public acceptance of \nreform measures, some of which are painful for consumers, at least in the short term. The \nongoing public information campaign should be continued and intensified. The unavoidable \nneed for the restructuring has to be explained by pointing out what would likely happen in its \nabsence,  and  by  outlining  its  medium-  and  long-term  benefits.  The  campaign  should  be \naccompanied by promulgating consumer rights. ERC has issued the bill of rights for consumer \nprotection and its implementation guidelines. \n \n63.  To protect electricity consumers from service interruption, ERC has issued guidelines on \nthe supplier of last resort in case of a retail electricity supplier\u2019s suspension from the WESM. \nThe guidelines also cover the appointment of a default temporary wholesale supplier for DUs \nand ECs that are unable to participate in the WESM and the contract market. Furthermore, ERC \nhas established a public complaint procedure, a consumer complaint desk at ERC, and a \nconsumer welfare desk at each of the DUs.  \n \n64.  When cross-subsidies are removed, welfare losses are possible, especially for poor \nhouseholds, which are generally more vulnerable than the non-poor. ERC has established \n\u201clifeline rates\u201d for marginalized end users. The lifeline rate provides grid-connected end users \nthat consume low levels of electricity with a reduced electricity rate. The subsidies provided by \nthe lifeline rate schemes are extensive. With the changes in the sales mix, the lifeline rates \nmight need to be reviewed and modified, or replaced by a different subsidy mechanism, to \nimprove targeting and protection of the poor.  For example, although the lifeline rates within the \nMeralco franchise area are not applicable to all electricity consumers, they are still relatively \n ", "20    \ngenerous regarding the monthly consumption threshold.36  These rates probably benefit more \nthan the poor, and the discounts given might not be sufficient to cushion adequately the impact \nof tariff increases on the poor. Although untargeted assistance to large groups of consumers \nmight be politically popular, it is not sustainable.  \n \nC.  Important Features of the PSDP \n65.  The policy framework for subprogram 1, as outlined in the policy matrix, aims to (i) \nrestore the sector\u2019s financial soundness; (ii) address the regulatory concerns of investors; (iii) \nstart  wholesale  competition;  (iv)  improve  the  investment  climate  for  privatization,  including \neducating the public about the rationale for the restructuring; and (v) protect consumer welfare.  \nUnder subprogram 2, whose scope and schedule can be modified based on the results of \nsubprogram 1, (i) the sector\u2019s financial soundness will be preserved; (ii) wholesale competition \nwill  be  expanded;  (iii)  retail  competition  will  be  started;  (iv)  a  significant  part  of  eligible \ngeneration assets will be privatized; and (v) TransCo concession will be awarded.  \n \n66.  Specifically,  the  policy  actions  prescribed  under  the  PSDP  will  address  the  major \nconstraints that affected the privatization of NPC, including the lack of bilateral supply contracts \nand the low creditworthiness of DUs. The policy actions are designed as a holistic solution with \na multipronged approach that recognizes the complexity of these issues and the interactions \nbetween  stakeholders.  To  promote  signing  of  bilateral  contracts,  DOE  requires  all  DUs  to \nensure adequate supply capacity for their captive markets, while ERC imposes a significant cost \npremium for DUs relying on the wholesale supplier of last resort (i.e., their demand is not \ncovered by a TSC and the WESM). The expected price volatilities in the WESM also will \nmotivate  DUs  to  enter  into  bilateral  supply  contracts  to  optimize  their  market  risk  profile. \nHowever, the bilateral contracts signed with DUs will help the privatization process only if these \nDUs, particularly ECs, are creditworthy. Under the PSDP policy framework, DOE will implement \nan action plan to consolidate ECs. For ECs that rely on wholesale supplier of last resort and fail \nto cure the problems within a specified period, this plan will include actions such as mandatory \nNEA or NPC transitional participation in the boards of ECs, as appropriate; and investment \nmanagement contracts with private investors. In parallel, ERC has issued guidelines to enable \nsmall and/or weak ECs to participate in the WESM through wholesale aggregators. The World \nBank\u2019s System Loss Reduction Project,37 will also help to strengthen ECs. \n  \n67.  The cluster approach will allow the Government and ADB to design subprogram 2 based \non implementation and experience gained under subprogram 1, as well as to reflect changes \nthat might occur in the external environment during subprogram 1. DOE will undertake a review \ntoward the end of subprogram 1. The review will result in a report, submitted for consideration to \nADB,  that  (i)  assesses  compliance  with  policy  actions  under  subprogram  1,  (ii)  assesses \nprogress with implementation of activities under the PSDP, and (iii) defines requirements for \nadjustments to the scope and timing of activities to be undertaken under subprogram 2. The \nreview will be based on the program framework (Appendix 1) and the policy matrix (Appendix \n2), the principal tools for program performance monitoring and review. \n \n                                                 \n36 Meralco customers with a monthly consumption of less than 50 kWh receive a discount of 50%, between 51 kWh \nand 70 kWh receive 35%, and between 71 kWh and 100 kWh receive 20%. ERC is revising the lifeline policy. \n37 World Bank. 2004. Philippines: The System Loss Reduction Project.- Project Approval Document. Washington, \nDC.lp  \n ", "  21\nD.  Cost and Financing Plan \n68.  The proposed PSDP will help the Government finance part of the adjustment costs of \nthe restructuring, and will support implementation of agreed policy actions. The power sector will \ncontinue to require significant funding support from the Government during 2006\u20132010, thereby \nremaining a challenge to the Government\u2019s efforts at fiscal consolidation. As shown in Table 5, \nthe power sector will require about $9.2 billion in direct Government financial support during \n2006\u20132010, which will be met mainly through (i) universal charge for stranded liabilities to be \nintroduced  by  January  2008,  (ii)  Government  budget  allocations  to  cover  part  of  interest \npayments of Government-absorbed NPC loans, (iii) Government commercial borrowings to \ncover interest and principal payments of Government-absorbed NPC loans, and (iv) PSALM\u2019s \ncommercial  borrowings  with  Government  guarantee  to  cover  PSALM\u2019s  deficit.  A  detailed \nanalysis of PSALM\u2019s financial performance and projections is in Appendix 7.  \n \nTable 5: Power Sector Financial Requirements, 2006\u20132010 \n($ million) \nYear  Debt Service on Absorbed NPC Loans  PSALM Deficit  Total \n  Principal  Interest       \n2006  640  324  1,172  2,136 \n2007    263  1,052  1,315 \n2008    263    894  1,157 \n2009  500  228  1,663  2,391 \n2010    221  1,951  2,172 \nTotal  1,140  1,299  6,732  9,171 \nNPC = National Power Corporation, PSALM = Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n69.  Table  6  below  shows  the  financing  plan  for  2006\u20132010.  The  PSDP  will  help  the \nGovernment meet part of power sector liabilities. Under subprogram 1, a policy-based program \nloan of $450 million will be provided, which accounts for 4.9% of the total financing requirement \nduring  the  period.  The  Government\u2019s  direct  contribution  (through  budget  allocations  and \ncommercial  borrowing)  will  be  $1,889  million,  representing  20.6%  of  the  requirement.  The \ncollection of the universal charges from January 2008 will generate $3,162 million, or 34.5% of \nthe financing requirement, during 2008\u20132010. PSALM will rely on commercial borrowing to raise \n$3,670  million,38 representing  40.0%  of  the  requirement.  Under  subprogram  2,  ADB  will \nconsider PCGs to assist PSALM with raising commercial borrowing on competitive terms. \n \nTable 6: Power Sector Financing Plan, 2006\u20132010 \n($ million) \nSources  Amount  % \nAsian Development Bank  450  4.9 \nUniversal charges  3,162  34.5 \nGovernment budget and/or commercial  1,889  20.6 \nborrowing \nPSALM commercial borrowing  3,670  40.0 \nTotal  9,171  100.0 \nPSALM = Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n38 On 25 October 2006, PSALM raised $500 million 10-year bonds with Government guarantee.  \n ", "22    \n70.  The ADB loan of $450 million, from its ordinary capital resources, will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years. The loan will carry an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per year. As the Borrower, the Government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility based \non  these  terms  and  conditions;  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  made \nindependently, and did not rely on any communication or advice from ADB. The loan, expected \nto be utilized over 24 months from January 2007 to December 2008, will be released in one \ntranche upon meeting the conditions of the policy matrix and upon loan effectiveness. Before \nsubprogram 2 is processed, the Government will have to demonstrate satisfactory progress with \nimplementation of subprogram 1.  \n \n71.  To complement ADB\u2019s program loan, the World Bank will support the power sector as a \ncomponent of its Development Policy Loans (DPL), which is envisaged to be provided in the \namount  of  $250  million.  The  DPL  also  will  include  other  policy  areas,  including  (i)  fiscal \nconsolidation and macroeconomic stability, (ii) governance and anticorruption, (iii) investment \nclimate, and (iv) social inclusion. For the power sector, the priority actions required under the \nWorld Bank\u2019s DPL form an integral part of the policy matrix developed under PSDP. The \nfinancial resources provided by the World Bank will help the Government to reduce costly \ncommercial borrowings. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n72.  DOF is the Executing Agency for the program loan, while DOE is the Implementing \nAgency. DOF will be responsible for the overall implementation of the Program, including (i) \ncompliance  with  policy  actions,  (ii)  program  administration,  (iii)  disbursements,  and  (iv) \nmaintenance of program records. The Energy Executive Committee before the Effective Date \nwill be formed to take charge of PSDP\u2019s implementation. The committee, comprising officials \nand executives of DOE, NEA, NPC, PEMC, Philippine National Oil Company, PSALM, and \nTransCo, will meet at least once a month. DOE will be responsible for the monitoring of program \nimplementation activities, and reporting implementation progress. \n \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement \n73.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible items (Appendix 8) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loan,39 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto the Government as the Borrower. Supporting import documentation will not be required, if \nduring each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Philippines\u2019 total \nimports  minus  imports from  nonmember  countries, ineligible  imports,  and imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \n                                                 \n39 ADB. 1998.

ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify \nthe accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n3.  Counterpart Funds \n74.  The  Government  will  use  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  program  loan,  under \narrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support the sector restructuring and meet the adjustment \ncosts associated with the PSDP, as agreed upon by the Government. The counterpart funds \ngenerated from the loan proceeds will be transferred from the Treasury to DOF to meet the \ncosts and counterpart funding requirements of the Program.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption \n75.  The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and Policy relating to the \nCombating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB and the Government will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. In particular, \nall contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program.  \n \n5.  Monitoring and Review \n76.  In cooperation with DOF and DOE, ADB will review periodically the implementation \nprogress of the PSDP, and will assess the impact of the PSDP on the sector. The Government \nwill keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral \nagencies that have implications for implementation of the PSDP, and will provide ADB with the \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing and Reporting \n77.  DOE shall prepare and submit to ADB (i) semi-annual progress reports on program \nimplementation and (ii) a subprogram 1 final review report by December 2008. The report will (i) \nevaluate the implementation of the policy reform measures under the subprogram 1 of PSDP, \n(ii) assess the impact on the sector, (iii) describe lessons from the program period, and (iv) \noutline further reforms and assistance needed for the development of the sector. In particular, \ngiven the need to closely monitor the financial recovery of the power sector, the Government will \nrequire PSALM to furnish ADB with certified copies of PSALM\u2019s audited consolidated financial \nstatements, including the financial statements of NPC and TransCo, not later than 6 months \nafter the end of each related fiscal year.  \n \n78.  The policy matrix (Appendix 2) contains 22 actions that are conditions precedent to \nsubmission  of  the  PSDP  to  the  Board.  Satisfactory  implementation  of  the  PSDP,  and \ncompliance  with  seven  actions,  is  required  to  enable processing  of  subprogram  2.  During \nsubprogram  1,  16  policy  actions  need  to  be  accomplished,  while  seven  actions  must  be \naccomplished during subprogram 2. Documentary evidence, in a form satisfactory to ADB, is \nrequired to demonstrate compliance with each of the actions in the policy matrix. \n ", "24    \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n79.   Power sector restructuring will have a significant positive impact on the sector, as well as \non the overall economy. With the large-scale privatization and introduction of a competitive \nelectricity market, the Government\u2019s role will be reduced to that of a policy maker and planner. \nFurther,  its  unsustainable  subsidies  to  the  power  sector  will  decline  to  levels  needed  for \nelectrification of unviable rural areas. Thus, a major fiscal crisis will be averted, and financial \nresources will be freed up for social services and infrastructure. Restoring financial viability to \nthe  power  sector  is  essential  to  fiscal  consolidation,  and  will  be  a  key  to  attracting  new \ninvestments in the power sector.  \n \n80.  The proposed ADB loan will help to lower the financing costs of PSALM and contribute \nto  lowering  the  universal  charge.  When  compared  with  Government  bonds  issued  at  the \nprevailing market conditions, the annual interest savings are estimated to total about $5 million \na year during the 15-year loan tenure. \n \n81.  The removal of cross-subsidies that benefit residential consumers will ease the burden \non industries, thereby improving their international competitiveness. The TOU pricing will reduce \ndemand during peak hours, resulting in more efficient use of power facilities. After the initial pain \ncaused by the need to increase electricity tariffs to levels required for cost recovery, efficiency \ngains brought about by competition will lower these costs in the medium and long run. This will \nbenefit all consumers.  \n \n82.  The lifeline tariff policy (para. 64) is to be supplemented by programs to improve and \nmake less costly the access of poor households, especially the rural poor, to electricity supply. \nSuch programs are financed through the universal charge component of the tariff to provide \nelectrification for the poor. The Government has launched a major rural electrification program, \nwhich aims to electrify all barangays40 in the country by 2008 and 90% of households by 2017. \nAs of December 2005, about 94% of the barangays in the country had access to electricity, \ncompared with 68% in 1998 when the power sector restructuring started. \n \n83.  Though the Philippines\u2019 GDP has grown steadily in recent years, the growth has not \nbeen pro-poor.41 The high electricity tariff was one of the factors that constrained poverty \nreduction. As electricity is an input to most economic processes, it is an important ingredient of \neconomic development that is essential for poverty reduction. Provision of electricity throughout \nthe country has been identified as one of the main tasks of the Government\u2019s Medium Term \nDevelopment Plan (footnote 10). The proposed PSDP will assist in providing a reliable electricity \nsupply to satisfy the forecast electricity demand, including the accelerated rural electrification \ninitiatives. The sustainable power supply and application of a lifeline rate will benefit poor \nconsumers. A summary of the Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy of the Program is in \nAppendix 9. \n  \nB.  Program Risks and Safeguards  \n84.  ADB has been advocating and supporting the Government\u2019s power sector restructuring \nprogram since it approved the PSRP in 1998. While the Government remains committed to \n                                                 \n40 A unit of administration consisting of 50\u2013100 families under a headman. \n41 ADB. 2005. Poverty in the Philippines: Income, Assets, and Access. Manila. \n ", "  25\npower sector reform, the delays in the privatization program have cast doubt on the relevance of \nthe power sector restructuring. A policy reversal to return to the previous vertically integrated, \nGovernment-owned monopoly is a major political risk. Such a move would exacerbate the \nfinancial difficulties of the power sector and discourage the private participation that is needed to \nensure long-term sustainability of the sector. The PSDP will provide essential support to the \nGovernment to ensure that the reform program is on track. Private investors have perceived \nADB\u2019s continued support as an important factor for the successful completion of the power \nsector reform. Therefore, with the privatization program at a critical juncture, the proposed \nPSDP will contribute to building much-needed confidence among private investors. Without \nsuch strong support from ADB, the momentum developed towards achieving the objectives of \nthe power sector reform is unlikely to be sustained. \n \n85.  PSALM continues to be exposed to significant financial risks that could threaten the \nentity\u2019s viability at any time, and undermine the Government\u2019s financial condition. As shown in \nAppendix 7, even under the most optimistic scenarios, significant Government intervention and \nsupport  is  required  to  restore  the  financial  viability  of  the  power  sector.  A  delay  in  the \nintroduction of the universal charge for stranded liabilities will mean an additional burden of \nabout $3.2 billion on the Government\u2019s finances between 2008 and 2010. The Government \nagreed to improve PSALM\u2019s cash generation, including the timely introduction of a universal \ncharge for stranded liabilities. Under subprogram 2, ADB may consider a PCG to help PSALM \nimplement debt restructuring options to address the cash flow mismatch over the succeeding 5 \nyears. \n \n86.  The power sector restructuring has been underway in the Philippines for five years since \nthe promulgation of EPIRA. During this period, capacity and technical skills of the Government \nagencies  concerned  have  been  strengthened  considerably.  Nevertheless,  to  avoid  design \nweaknesses  and  implementation  delays,  lessons  from  the  PSRP  have  been  incorporated. \nFurther,  extensive  consultations  have  been  held  with  the  Government  and  its  agencies; \ndevelopment partners, such as JBIC, US Agency for International Development, and the World \nBank;  potential  private  investors;  and  other  stakeholders.  Target  dates  are  set  only  for \nsubprogram 1 to allow flexibility in the overall implementation schedule. The program cluster \napproach  also  provides  flexibility  in  design.  As  subprogram  1  approaches  completion,  its \naccomplishments will be reviewed. The results will help define the scope and schedule of \nsubprogram 2.  \n \n87.  To persuade investors and lenders and other political risk insurers to finance energy \nprojects in the Philippines, the proposed PSDP will be used as an anchor to offer investors (to \ncover subordinated debt, for example), as well as foreign and domestic commercial lenders (to \nthe  extent  required),  long-term  PRGs  covering  the  risks  of  (i)  inconvertibility;  (ii)  political \nviolence; (iii) expropriation; and, when appropriate, (iv) breach of contract. 42  ADB's PRG would \nprovide investors and lenders the comfort that the Government stands behind its obligations and \ncommitments. Specifically, the Government recently advised ADB that some interested bidders \nfor the TransCo concession might require a PRG to facilitate the financing of their acquisition. \nTo allay investors' concerns, the Government has asked ADB and World Bank to prepare a \nletter of interest about the availability of their respective PRGs. If a bidder requires a PRG from \nADB for TransCo, a separate Report and Recommendation of the President will be prepared for \n                                                 \n42 The Proposed PSDP will satisfy the participation requirement for credit enhancements, including guarantees, that \nmay be considered to support private participation in power generation and transmission. See ADB. 2006. Review \nof the Asian Development Bank's Credit Enhancement Operations, Manila (para. 57, endorsed by the Board on 29 \nAugust). \n ", "26    \nconsideration by the Board. Given the potentially large size of PRGs for this project, ADB is \nprepared to cooperate with other guarantors (public and private) to mobilize the additional \namounts of coverage required.  \n \n88.  A review of the environmental implications of the proposed PSDP found them to be \nlargely positive, though indirect, if the goals in the policy matrix are achieved as designed. The \npotential positive impacts of the PSDP include:  \n \n(i)  factoring  environmental  costs  of  power  generation  and  transmission  into  a \nrationalized and viable tariff system to ensure sufficient financing for air pollution \ncontrol and power sector environmental management;  \n(ii)  better safeguarding of power sector environmental compliance by strengthening \nthe  ERC  institutional  framework  to  ensure  compliance  (including  the \nEnvironmental Compliance Certificate) when issuing licenses to generators and \nsuppliers of electricity;  \n(iii)  progressively  reducing  air  pollution  from  thermal  power  generation  and \nwatershed  management  pressure  associated  with  hydropower  generation  by \nimproving power sector efficiencies through ERC provision of performance-based \nregulations and guidelines; and \n(iv)  indirectly  reducing  power  sector  environmental  impact  by  strengthening \nconsumer awareness of energy efficiency and conservation. \n \nVI.

Department of Energy (DOE) \n1.  DOE is the agency responsible for formulation of Government policy for the country\u2019s \nenergy sector in general, and the electric power industry in particular. As part of its streamlining \nefforts to address the critical issues facing the power sector, DOE established the Electric \nPower Industry Management Bureau (EPIMB) to take responsibility for matters relating to the \npower industry. One of EPIMB\u2019s functions is the preparation of an annual power development \nplan. However, with the extent of power sector deregulation envisaged under Electric Power \nIndustry Reform Act (EPIRA), the influence of the plan on the development of the power sector \nmight be limited to the provision of a guide. EPIMB is directly involved in other activities, \nincluding (i)  establishment of the wholesale electricity spot market (WESM) in collaboration with \nother industry participants, and particularly the appointment of an independent market operator \nto manage the bulk power trade market; (ii) promotion of rural electrification, and coordination of \nthe Government\u2019s expanded rural electrification program that aims to provide electricity to all \nbarangays1 in  the  country;  (iii)  administration  of  policies  promoting  the  use  of  electricity \ngenerated from renewable sources; and (iv) administration of the host community fund.   \n \n2.  Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) \n2.  PSALM  has  been  established  as  a  Government  corporation  to  implement  EPIRA\u2019s \nrestructuring and privatization mandate. To this end, PSALM has been (i) mobilizing resources \nto cover National Power Corporation (NPC)\u2019s stranded debt and stranded contract costs, which \narise due to the underutilization of certain generation assets as a result of a slower-than-\nexpected  growth  of  electricity  demand  in  the  recent  past;  (ii)  reviewing  and  renegotiating \nindependent power producer (IPP) contracts to obtain more favorable terms for users of IPP-\ngenerated electricity; (iii) developing and implementing a privatization plan for the sale of NPC\u2019s \ngeneration assets and other properties, and the transfer of NPC\u2019s transmission operations to a \nprivate sector concessionaire; (iv) developing a plan for the assumption of relevant National \nElectrification Administration (NEA) long-term loan liabilities following the condonation of electric \ncooperative (EC) loans in accordance with EPIRA (Section 60); and (v) negotiating transition \nsupply contracts (TSC) with distribution utilities (DUs) for the sale of electricity from NPC-owned \npower generation sources. \n \n3.  PSALM\u2019s  major  sources  of  finance  include  (i)  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  NPC\u2019s \ngeneration facilities, as well as generation revenue until such a sale; (ii) revenue from the \ntransmission grid concessionaire; (iii) Government\u2019s partial assumption of debt liabilities;2 and \n(iv)  revenue  from  the  stranded  debt  and  stranded  contract  cost  portion  of  the  common \n(universal) charge levied on all electricity end users in accordance with EPIRA (Section 34[a]).3  \n \n3.  Wholesale Electricity Spot Market \n4.  DOE established WESM in accordance with Section 30 of EPIRA. Under WESM, a day \nwill be divided into 24 one-hour trading periods, and generators will bid competitively for a \nposition on the electricity dispatch generation schedule for each trading period. In any trading \nperiod, generators will be dispatched in the order of their bid prices, with the market-clearing \n                                                 \n1    A unit of administration consisting of 50\u2013100 families under a headman. \n2  Section 32 of EPIRA calls for the Government to assume directly up to P200 billion ($3.9 billion) of NPC\u2019s financial \nobligations. The Government had considered increasing the debt assumption to P500 billion, but eventually only \nthe P200 billion required by EPIRA was assumed.  \n3  Other revenue sources include proceeds from the sale of subtransmission assets to DUs, and generation revenue \nfrom the Agus and Pulangui hydropower stations in Mindanao, which will not be sold. These revenues are unlikely \nto materially affect PSALM\u2019s financial position. \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \nprice being set by the highest bidder to be dispatched.4 This model is economically efficient \nbecause competition for dispatch should ensure that at times of low electricity demand higher-\npriced generators are not dispatched. Thus, the price paid by customers purchasing electricity \nfrom the market is reduced. As demand increases, prices should rise to the extent that it \nbecomes economical for investors to build new generation to enter the market. Since new \ngeneration faces no constraints on entry, economic theory would suggest that only relatively \nefficient new generation will be constructed. A relatively less efficient new entrant would risk \nbeing displaced by a more efficient entrant and, therefore, not being dispatched.  \n \n5.  WESM  intends  that  all  generation,  except  small  plants  embedded  in  distribution \nsystems, be dispatched through the market based on bid price.5 However, a financial hedge \nmarket will operate in parallel with the WESM. Financial hedges are bilateral contracts between \nelectricity generators and purchasers for a fixed price and quantity of electricity in a given \ntrading period, and require the contracting parties to pay one another the difference between the \nmarket clearing price and the hedged contract price for the quantity of electricity contracted.6 \nHedge contracts play an important role in the operation of the market, giving price certainty to \npurchasers and providing generators with a secure and predictable revenue stream. In a mature \nmarket, hedge contract prices will be similar to the expected market-clearing price. However, \nconsistent with Section 45(c) of EPIRA, no DU is allowed to hedge more than 90% of its \nelectricity requirements for the first 5 years of market operation. \n  \n4.  Small Power Utilities Group (SPUG) \n6.  SPUG  is  a  separate  division  of  NPC,  which  supplies  electricity  to  ECs  and  local \ngovernments operating distribution networks that are not connected to any of the three main \ngrids. Its power plants range in size up to 14 megawatt (MW). The large power barges use \nbunker C heavy fuel oil, while the smaller plants generally are fueled by light fuel oil.7 SPUG \nalso owns and operates off-grid transmission systems in Palawan and Mindoro.8 In accordance \nwith  Section  47  of  EPIRA,  SPUG\u2019s  assets  are  exempt  from  the  privatization  process. \nNevertheless, the DOE and NPC initiated a program aimed at luring private sector players into \nthe business of missionary electrification. Through a DOE circular, which became effective on \n12 February 2004,9 NPC-SPUG areas are to be grouped into waves based on the suitability of \nthe areas for supply by new private providers (NPP). The first wave groupings, consisting of 14 \nareas, were selected based on their respective peak demand levels. Through different options, \nsix areas have begun their respective processes for the entry of NPPs. Section 70 of EPIRA \nrequires that missionary electrification be funded from sales of electricity in missionary areas \n                                                 \n4  This is strictly true only if the generators were supplying electricity to one point in the transmission grid. In \npractice, minimizing losses, ensuring that prudent power transfer capacities of transmission grid elements are not \nexceeded, and maintaining adequate network security are necessary. The location of generation on the grid, \ntherefore, is an important consideration. As a result, a more complicated dispatch model is used, and each grid \nnode has different clearing prices. This might result in some low priced generation not being dispatched, and \nbeing displaced by more expensive generation at another node. However, it does not alter the fundamental \neconomic concepts on which the market design is based. \n5  Some generation, based on wind power for example, cannot bid into the market since generation output will vary \ncontinuously with prime mover input. Such generators are necessarily \u201cprice takers\u201d, and in any trading period will \nbe paid the market-clearing price for the node to which they are connected. \n6  Hedge contracts also are known as \u201ccontracts for differences\u201d because, if the market-clearing price is above the \nhedge price, the generator will pay the difference to the purchaser. The reverse will occur when the hedge price is \ngreater than the market-clearing price. In this way, the physical operation of the system or the market-clearing \nprice is not distorted by the bilateral contracts. \n7  The exception is Balongbong in Catanduanes province, which is a 1.8 MW hydropower station. \n8   Ongoing projects are in Masbate, Marinduque, and Catanduanes. \n9   DOE Circular No. 2004-01-001. \n ", "    Appendix 3  45 \n   \nand from the missionary electrification component of the universal charge. In accordance with \nthis provision, NPPs taking over from SPUG in privatized supply areas also will be eligible for \nsubsidy funding from the universal charge. \n \n5.  Electricity Cooperatives \n7.  While EPIRA did not materially alter the franchise arrangements10 or structure of the \ndistribution sector, it introduced some changes that will impact the way these utilities operate. \nThe more significant changes include the (i) structural and functional unbundling of distribution \nbusiness  activities  and  rates,  which  means  that  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and \nsupply costs will be shown separately on customer bills, and generation and transmission costs \nwill be treated as a pass-through; (ii) introduction of open access and retail competition on \ndistribution wires;11 (iii) provision of restrictions on the sourcing of demand requirements from \nassociated firms (not more than 50%) and from bilateral contracts (DUs must purchase at least \n10%  of  their  requirements  from  WESM  for  the  first  5  years  after  its  establishment);12 (iv) \ncondonation of the loans of ECs and the assumption of these loans by PSALM in exchange for \na reduction in the rates of the ECs by an amount commensurate to the resulting savings; and (v) \nremoval of cross subsidiaries within a grid, and between grids and/or classes of customers, \nwithin 3 years of the establishment of a universal charge by Energy Regulatory Commission \n(ERC).  \n \n8.  ECs  are  customer-owned,  nonprofit  organizations  without  a  capital  structure.  The \nfinancial and operational position of the 119 ECs vary. In 2005, 77 ECs generated insufficient \nrevenues to cover their operating and debt service costs, while 48 were unable to cover even \ntheir operating costs. These figures are higher by 24% and 85%, respectively, than in 2004. In \naddition, 63 ECs reported power losses greater than 14%.13 Of these, 16 reported losses higher \nthan 20%. Seventeen ECs were in arrears to NEA on loan repayments, and 42 had overdue \naccounts with NPC for purchased power as of 30 June 2006.14 The NEA balance sheet shows \nP2.6 billion in outstanding EC loans as of 31 December 2004, down from P3.7 billion as of 31 \nDecember 2003 and from P15.4 billion as of 31 December 2002.15 The movement is primarily \ndue to PSALM\u2019s assumption, in accordance with EPIRA, of the ECs\u2019 loan obligations to NEA as \nof June 2001. In 2003 and 2004, PSALM assumed almost P18 billion of EC loans and made \npayments of around P3.6 billion from 2003 to 2005. NEA uses a categorization system to \nmeasure the performance of ECs. The present system revised in 2005 ranks ECs on a scale \nfrom A+ to E based on (i) loan repayment history, (ii) system loss levels, (iii) revenue collection \nefficiency, (iv) level of power purchase payment arrears, (v) level of non-power operating costs, \nand (vi) barangay energization16.  Fifty-eight and 13 ECs were rated A+ and A, respectively, \nwhile nine and 10 ECs were rated D and E, respectively, based on these categories. \n                                                 \n10  Before the passage of EPIRA, the power to award distribution franchises was vested in the National Electrification \nCommission operating under NEA. Under Section 27 of the EPIRA, this power is now vested in Congress \nprovided that existing franchises must continue for their full term and that the power to renew and cancel the \nfranchises of ECs will remain with NEA for 5 years after the effectiveness of EPIRA. \n11  DUs have an exclusive right to supply electricity to customers connected to their network. Under open access and \nretail competition, electricity supply will become competitive and DUs must let competing electricity suppliers \ntransport electricity over their network.  \n12  Many of the smaller DUs probably will not be able to meet the prudential requirements to allow them to trade in \nthe market. However, Section 30 of EPIRA provides that NEA may, \u201cin exchange for adequate security and a \nguarantee fee\u201d, act as a guarantor for purchases of electricity in WESM by any EC or small DU. \n13  In accordance with RA No. 7832, 1994 (the Anti-Pilferage Act), ECs are subject to a loss cap of 14%. The cost of \nlosses above the cap is ignored when setting the rate, and cannot be recovered from customers. \n14   Excludes 8 ECs whose overdue accounts with NPC are being disputed. \n15   Additional lending in 2005 has since increased outstanding EC loans to NEA to P2.9 billion.   \n16   The inclusion of power reliability as an additional criterion for the ranking of ECs was deferred for 2006. \n ", "46  Appendix 3 \n9.  As with NPC, NEA had experienced severe financial stress in recent years. In 2003, it \nrecorded a net operating loss of P518 million, up from P122 million in 2002. NEA\u2019s 2003 \nbalance sheet reported a deficit of P7 billion, with current assets of only P2.7 billion (including \nP1.3 billion of matured loan receivables from ECs), compared with current liabilities of P13.1 \nbillion.  The  balance  sheet  also  showed  some  P5.5  billion  in  long-term  loans  from  the \nGovernment. Some of these loan advances were made to ensure that NEA does not default on \nrepayment of its foreign debt, which amounted to P3.1 billion as of 31 December 2003. Loan \ncondonation will mean that PSALM, rather than the ECs will be responsible for making most \noutstanding loan principal payments. However, interest payments for these loans will now be to \nthe sole account of NEA. In early 2004, NEA was reorganized and staffing levels rationalized to \naddress the financial problems and more effectively carry out its revised mandate under EPIRA. \nThe reduction in personnel expenses and the restructuring of some EC loans resulted in a 2004 \nnet  operating  income  of  P200  million,  a  marked  improvement  over  the  previous  year\u2019s \nperformance. Mostly due to higher Government subsidy, to cover NEA\u2019s interest expenses and \na decline in subsidies granted to ECs during the year, NEA reported a slightly positive bottom \nline in 2005.  \n \n10.  Manila Electric Company (Meralco) is the largest DU in the Philippines. As the recipient \nof an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan,17 its performance is of particular interest. During the \nmid-1990s, immediately following the approval of ADB\u2019s loan, Meralco\u2019s financial performance \nwas satisfactory. However, Meralco\u2019s financial position has deteriorated in recent years to the \nextent that it has failed to meet ADB\u2019s required 8% rate on return base (RORB) since 1997. In \nfact, Meralco also failed to meet its covenanted self-financing ratio of 20% in 2002. Meralco \nposted a before-tax loss of P29.6 billion in 2002, before recovering slightly in 2003.18 However, \nan adverse Court of Appeals ruling on Meralco\u2019s unbundling case filed with the ERC required \nthe company to set aside provisions for probable losses of almost P10 billion in 2004, pushing \nMeralco back into the red for the year. Additional provisioning of P5.9 billion in 2005 meant that \nMeralco reported another net loss for that year. A major reason for this deteriorating financial \nperformance has been the lack of increases in Meralco\u2019s distribution rate between 1994 and \n2003. Meralco\u2019s new tariff application under the performance based regulation is being reviewed \nby ERC. \n \n6.  Energy Regulatory Commission \n11.  EPIRA established ERC as the industry\u2019s independent regulator, succeeding the Energy \nRegulatory  Board.  New  functions  and  responsibilities  have  been  introduced  by  the  law, \nincluding (i) developing and enforcing technical standards for transmission and distribution; (ii) \nenforcing the WESM rules; (iii) licensing generators and suppliers of electricity;19 (iii) setting \nrates for non-contestable sectors of the industry;20 (iv) determining and approving the level of \nthe  universal  charge;  (v)  preventing  abuse  of  market  power,  and  anticompetitive  or \ndiscriminatory behavior, by industry participants; and (vi) resolving disputes between industry \nparticipants, or between industry participants and customers. \n \n                                                 \n17  ADB.1992.

Manila. \n18  This includes the extraordinary loss realized because of the Supreme Court refund decision. \n19 The purpose of a license is to ensure adherence to standards rather than to limit the number of participants.  \nConsistent with this philosophy, licenses in the generation sector are called certificates of compliance in EPIRA. \n20 Rates for generation and supply currently are regulated. Generation rates will cease to be regulated after the \ncommencement of WESM. Upon the implementation of retail competition, the retail supply rate to contestable \ncustomers will no longer be regulated. \n ", "    Appendix 3  47 \n   \n12.  Following the passage of EPIRA, all utilities have been required to file a petition for the \napproval of unbundled rates, while ECs also have been required to file a petition for rate \nreductions  due  to  the  condonation  of  NEA  loans.  In  the  unbundled  rate,  generation, \ntransmission, and universal charges are itemized separately on a customer bill. Any changes in \nthe unbundled components of generation, transmission, and universal charges are treated as a \npass through, although ERC approval is required before these changes can be reflected in \ncustomer bills. Loan condonation applications from ECs are being treated separately. Loan \ncondonation applies only to the distribution component of the unbundled rate. The petitions \nwere filed in accordance with Section 60 of EPIRA, which requires that a reduction of the rates \nof  ECs  commensurate  with  the  savings  due  to  loan  condonation.  The  processing  of  loan \ncondonation and rate unbundling petitions is now substantially complete. \n \n13.  ERC has examined rate unbundling applications using 2000 as the historic test year.  \nWhile rate unbundling is technically revenue neutral, the process used effectively has involved a \nreview of the existing costs. As a result, distribution rates have been revised.21 ERC first \nreplaced the previous automatic cost adjustment formulae with a generation rate adjustment \nmechanism (GRAM) and an incremental currency rate adjustment (ICERA). However, ERC now \nhas introduced the automatic adjustment of generation rates and system loss rates (AGRA) to \nreplace GRAM. Under GRAM and ICERA, adjustments needed to be pre-approved by ERC \nbefore they could be included in customer bills. Under AGRA, the process has been changed to \nallow adjustments to be applied by the regulated entities, subject to retrospective approval by \nERC.  \n \n14.  With technical assistance (TA) from ADB,22 the ERC promulgated the performance-\nbased rate (PBR) methodology for the transmission sector on 29 May 2003. The PBR regime \ndeparts from the traditional RORB methodology, which has been used in the Philippines for the \npast  80  years.  The  methodology  provides  that  a  revenue  cap  for  each  year  of  a  5-year \nregulatory  period  will  be  set  before  the  beginning  of  the  period,23 and  that  under  normal \ncircumstances these caps will not be changed.24 The revenue caps will be based on a series of \nbuilding blocks that include (i) operating and maintenance expenditure; (ii) depreciation; (iii) a \nreturn on invested capital, including system assets valued using the depreciated optimized \nreplacement cost method; (iv) a return on capital expenditure undertaken during the regulatory \nperiod; and (v) income and other taxes. The contribution of each building block to the revenue \nrequirement  in  a  particular  year  is  based  on  a  forecast  of  the  business\u2019  expenditure \nrequirements  over  the  regulatory  period.  The  scheme  includes  an  efficiency  incentive  that \nrewards or penalizes an operator depending on the difference between its achieved level of \nnetwork  performance  and  preset  performance  targets.  It  also  has  an  efficiency  carryover \nmechanism, whereby the benefits achieved by reducing costs below forecast levels can be \nretained by the regulated entity for a 5-year period.  \n \n15.  On 5 January 2005, the ERC issued guidelines for a new methodology for setting \nwheeling rates for private DUs. This is a PBR methodology that is similar in most respects to the \nPBR methodology to be used for the transmission sector. The key difference for the distribution \nsector is that the methodology will be used to determine a maximum average price,25 rather \n                                                 \n21 Some utilities have experienced rate reductions as a result of their unbundling applications. \n22 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for a Competition Policy for the Electricity \nSector. Manila.  \n23 As envisaged, a regulatory period normally will last 5 years. \n24 The methodology has provisions for a review of the revenue caps in situations that are outside the control of the \nregulated entity and that would have a significant impact on the profitability of the regulated entity. \n25  The average price is determined by dividing the total amount billed for regulated services in a regulatory year by \ntotal energy delivered in that year. \n ", "48  Appendix 3 \nthan a maximum allowed revenue as in the transmission business. Hence, under this rate-\nsetting mechanism, the revenue received by DUs can rise and fall with the volume of electricity \ndelivered,  whereas  the  maximum  allowed  revenue  determined  for  National  Transmission \nCorporation  is  independent  of  electricity  volumes.

Noa \n \nContribution of the sector  to poverty reduction in the Philippines:  \nThe Program will improve the investment climate and promote economic growth that will benefit the poor. Specifically, \na major component of the current energy sector restructuring program in Philippines is to provide rural areas with \nelectricity access at affordable price to attain economic and social development. Lifeline rates will be provided to poor \nconsumers. With access to electricity, the poor will enjoy better education, entertainment, communication, health, \ncomfort, convenience, and productivity.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nAs electricity is an input to most economic processes, it is an important ingredient of economic development that is \nessential for poverty reduction. Provision of electricity throughout the country is one of the key tasks of the \nGovernment\u2019s Medium Term Development Strategy (2004\u20132012). The proposed Program will help provide an \nadequate and reliable electricity supply to satisfy the forecast electricity demand, including the accelerated rural \nelectrification initiatives. Although the impact on poverty reduction cannot be quantified, the lower power tariff and \napplication of lifeline rate will benefit poor consumers. The lifeline rate provides less expensive electricity for grid-\nconnected end-use customers with low electricity consumption. The subsidies provided by the lifeline rate schemes \nare extensive in the Philippines. For example, residential customers in the Meralco franchise area using less than 50 \nkWh per month get a discount of 50% on their electricity bill, and customers using from 51\u2013100 kWh per month get a \n20% discount. To fund these subsidies, all customers using more than 100 kWh per month pay an additional P0.0761 \nper kWh.   \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThough increased electrification rate will improve women\u2019s living condition and productivity in particular, the program is \nnot a gender-specific.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?
