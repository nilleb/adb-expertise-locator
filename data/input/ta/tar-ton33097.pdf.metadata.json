Discussions between the Government of Tonga and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\non developing an economic and public sector reform program (EPSRP) have been ongoing\nsince 1998. In response to the Government's request for technical assistance (TA) to formulate\nthe  proposed  EPSRP,  ADB  submitted  a  draft  concept  paper,  including  the  institutional\nframework  for  EPSRP  management,  to  the  Government  in  August  1999.  The  draft  was\napproved by the Cabinet of Ministers in April 2000. The TA was included in the approved 2000\ncountry assistance program.1 A Country Programming Mission in June 2001 confirmed the\nunderstanding previously reached on the TA, and a program loan of $10 million for the EPSRP\nwas included in the loan program for 2002.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  The national strategic vision of Tonga has as its key objective the attainment of a higher\nstandard of living for all Tongans. Achievement of this objective has been limited by a low long-\nterm economic growth rate of around 1 percent per annum, and by employment growth well\nbelow the rate of increase of the labor force.2 The situation reflects policy and governance\nenvironments that have discouraged private sector investment, and the crowding out effects of a\nrelatively large public sector. Considerable efforts that ADB and bilateral aid agencies made in\nthe past in support of reforms yielded disappointing results, which were attributed to lack of\npolitical will. Nevertheless, significant changes have occurred since then. In January 2000, the\nreform-minded Prince Ulukalala Lavaka Ata was appointed Prime Minister.  In January 2001,\nthe Prime Minister appointed a similarly reform-minded minister of finance, who was given\nresponsibility for the EPSRP. The various changes that have already taken place are in line with\nthe prioritized development objectives and policies established in the Strategic Development\nPlan Seven, 2001-2003. Now  the Government is actively seeking to accelerate the reform\nprocess by formulating and implementing an EPSRP.\n3. The  proposed  EPSRP  aims  to  enhance  private-sector-led  economic  growth  by  (i)\npromoting  policies  that  create  an  environment  conducive  to  increased  investment  and\nemployment by the private sector, and (ii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of service\ndelivery by the public sector. The following paragraphs briefly discuss the specific reform areas\nunder the proposed EPSRP.\n4.  Tax, Tariff, and Customs Reforms. The current tax system in Tonga relies heavily on\nforeign  trade  taxes,  particularly  those  on  imports.3  It  is  affected  by  an  extensive  array  of\nexemptions,  allowances,  and  loopholes  that  result  in  inequities  and  inefficiency  in  tax\nadministration.4 The income tax base is narrow and the whole taxation system has become\nregressive. Key areas of tax reform include balancing tax revenues by shifting from trade\ntaxation to domestic taxation, specifically income tax and value-added tax. Tax administration\nmust also be strengthened to ensure better levels of compliance with tax laws, and to reduce\nthe current lack of predictability in their application, an area that will receive technical assistance\n(TA) from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID). With assistance from\n                  \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in February 1999.\n2  A preliminary poverty assessment was completed in March 2001 under TA 5907-REG: Poverty Assessment in\nPacific Developing Member Countries. The draft discussion paper was sent to the Government for comments in\nJune 2001.\n3  Trade taxes account for about 13 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices and provide around 65\npercent of Government tax revenue. Sales and other taxes provide about 14 percent of tax revenue, while direct\ntaxes provide about 20 percent.\n4 Database of the Pacific Financial and Technical Assistance Center.", "2\nthe Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center, the Government prepared a new tax policy to\naddress many of these issues. A cabinet paper and specific recommendations on tax changes\nare under consideration. The Government is also reviewing the tariff system in the context of the\nplanned  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization.  Customs  administration  also  needs\nstrengthening to increase the effectiveness of revenue raising.\n5. Foreign  Investment,  Licensing  Regime,  and  Competition  Policy.  The  existing\nlicensing regime causes significant difficulties to private sector operators, especially foreign\ninvestors. Although the new Companies Act has simplified the process of registering new\nenterprises, the existing licensing system is cumbersome, lacks transparency, and discriminates\nagainst  foreign  investors.  Reforms  in  this  area  include  (i)  identifying  and  establishing  a\ntransparent policy for sectors and subsectors where foreign investors can or cannot invest, (ii)\nestablishing a transparent foreign investment registration system, (iii) introducing a transparent\nbusiness  licensing  process  independent  of  investment  origin,  and  (iv)  abolishing  the\nrequirement to obtain a new business license if existing activities are expanded. The Foreign\nInvestment Advisory Service has submitted to the Government a set of recommendations on\namendments  to  the  Licenses  and  Industrial  Development  Incentives  acts,  and  on  foreign\ninvestment legislation.\n6. Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) Reforms. The corporatization or privatization of PSEs\nis  an  area  of  reform  within  the  EPSRP.  Overall,  the  Government    controls  close  to  50\ncommercial entities. There is little reliable information on employment, revenue, or profitability of\nPSEs, and most have never paid any dividend to the Government.  They have higher salary\nstructures than the civil service and collectively employ around 1,650 people. Progress with\nPSE reforms has been very slow compared with that in neighboring Pacific developing member\ncountries  (PDMCs).  A  Government  Investment  Unit  was  established  within  the  Ministry  of\nFinance (MOF) in July 1999 to monitor PSE performance. There is a commitment to act on His\nMajesty's Privy Council decision of December 1995 that MOF should submit a proposal for a\ncomplete review of all Government investments to secure dividend payments. Reforms to be\nsponsored under the EPSRP could include the following sequenced measures: (i) adopting a\nPSE reform strategy and a policy framework; (ii) adopting the PSE Act; (iii) strengthening the\nGovernment  Investment  Unit;  (iv)  identifying  commercial  activities  for  corporatization  and\nprivatization; and (v) initiating a commercialization and privatization program. The New Zealand\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) is expected to provide TA in these areas.\n7. Strengthening Public Financial Management. The Government generally has pursued\na prudent fiscal policy that ensures the maintenance of aggregate fiscal discipline. A fiscal rule\nthat recurrent expenditure not exceed recurrent revenue has been adopted, leaving capital\nexpenditure to be determined by the availability of foreign financing. However, there is a need to\nimprove allocative efficiency and operational management. Wages and salaries account for over\n50 percent of current expenditure, crowding out expenditure on other goods and services and\nlimiting the availability of domestic resources for investment. Program budgeting began in FY\n1998/99, with the unification of the recurrent and development budgets and the intention of\nmatching resource allocation more closely with strategic priorities. However, there remains\nsignificant scope for improving5 its implementation, which will be addressed by AusAID.\n8. Under the EPSRP, the following reform measures will be considered: (i) introducing a\nthree-year rolling framework for fiscal and sector policies; (ii) strengthening the links between\n                  \n5  Financial  management  and  accountability  are  still  based  on  the  line  item  budgeting  modality.  With  the\ncentralization of payment processing and accounting controls, it is important to ensure that the accounting system\nis adequate to support timely monitoring of actual expenditure against program budget appropriations and timely\nreporting for corrective actions.", "3\nprogram budgeting and planning exercises, covering both recurrent and development budgets;\nand (iii) improving departmental financial controls through timely recording and reporting of\ntransactions.6 Strengthening the Office of the Auditor General, based on the review of its role,\nscope of its audit responsibilities, and available skills will further advance the reform agenda.\n9. Civil  Service  and  Legislative  Reform. There  are  approximately  5,450  established\npositions in the civil service, with 4,880 positions filled at the end of 2000. An estimated\nadditional 700 casual employees are paid on a daily basis. The Government accepts that the\ncivil service is unnecessarily large and is committed to rightsizing in a manner that does not\ncompromise the quality of service delivery. Civil service reform committees established in 2000\nhave reported on (i) the core functions of government as prescribed by existing laws and\nregulations, (ii) a plan for civil service reform, and (iii) means of implementation. There is a need\nfor TA in designing and implementing an effective gender-sensitive civil service reform program,\nincluding an estimate of financial costs arising from any downsizing. The following direction of\norganizational changes could be incorporated under the EPSRP: (i) enhancing coordination of\nthe  whole  of  government  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  (ii)  establishing  a  civil  service\ncommission,  and  (iii)  implementing  reorganization  of  line  departments  and  agencies.7  In\naddition, Tonga\u2019s laws and regulations need to be reviewed and consolidated, since the last\nconsolidation occurred in 1988.\n10. Financial Sector Reforms. The financial system consists of the National Reserve Bank\nof Tonga (NRBT), three commercial banks, and the Tonga Development Bank. The Strategic\nDevelopment Plan Seven, 2001-2003 identifies two main issues that must be addressed under\nEPSRP if monetary policy is to contribute better to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability.\nThe first is NRBT\u2019s weak balance sheet, which currently prevents the effective use of indirect\nmonetary  policy  instruments.8 It  is  necessary  to  clarify  long  term  funding  arrangements\n(including possible recapitalization) for NRBT in coordination with MOF. The second issue\nconcerns the need to strengthen NRBT\u2019s supervisory capacity in line with the provisions of the\nFinancial Institutions Act of 1991 and subsequent amendments, so as to ensure adequate\nenforcement of prudential regulations. A specific issue in regard to banking supervision is the\nserious financial distress of one of the commercial banks, which has been unprofitable since its\nestablishment in 1993. This will need to be addressed so as to maintain stability in an otherwise\nsound financial system.\n11. In FY 1998/99, ADB and MFAT provided TA to formulate and implement the strategic\nplan for the Tonga Development Bank (TDB). To date, implementing the plan has involved (i)\ninitiating organizational restructuring, (ii) bringing lending rates in line with those of commercial\nbanks, and (iii) improving the recovery of bad debts and loan monitoring. In conjunction with\npossible  funding  for  recapitalization,  reforms  should  include  increasing  private  sector\nrepresentation on the TDB board, clarifying its organizational mandate, and ensuring autonomy\nof operations.\n                  \n6  The plan is to establish a Financial Accountability Improvement Team to examine means of improving the\noperation of the  budgeting system, including linkages with the national strategy and associated three-year rolling\nPublic Sector Development Program.\n7  This could include the establishment of a statutory Tonga revenue commission, combining the functions of three\nexisting agencies with general revenue-raising responsibilities (Customs Department, Inland Revenue Department,\nand the Licensing Branch of the Department of Labor, Commerce, and Industry).\n8  When NRBT was established in 1989, the net foreign assets position was transferred from the Bank of Tonga by\nissuing NRBT bills. In the absence of financial support from MOF and with a gradual loss of foreign reserves,\nNRBT\u2019s income position worsened to the point where it stopped issuing 3-month bills in 1998, retaining only one-\nmonth bills on which below-market rates were paid.", "4\n12. As in most other PDMCs, interviews with commercial banks indicate constraints relating\nto the availability of collateral. While asset-backed lending is less of a problem in Tonga than in\nsome other PDMCs, the legal framework for mortgages needs to be reviewed and updated.9\nCommercial banks indicate the need for chattel legislation to facilitate asset-backed lending.\nThe proposed EPSRP could include adoption of such legislation.\n13. Potential  Impact  of  Reforms.  The  staff  analyzed  scenarios  with  and  without  the\nEPSRP. Medium-term outcomes can conservatively be expected by 2006, as economic policy\nreform measures will take some time to have an impact. The no-reform scenario is one in which\nthere  is  no  change  in  the  current  economic  policy  environment.  In  this  scenario,  overall\neconomic growth is estimated at 1 percent per annum. Provided that net migration continues at\nthe rate in recent years, and the resident population increases by 0.3 percent annually, this rate\nof GDP growth implies growth in per capita income of approximately 0.7 percent per annum. In\nthe reform scenario, the overall growth rate is estimated to rise to 2.2 percent per annum.\nAssuming the same population growth rate as in the base scenario, per capita income rises at\n1.9 percent per annum.\n14. Public Consultations and Social Impact Monitoring.  A key lesson learned from other\nreform programs supported by ADB10 is that design issues\u2014appropriate scope, sequence, and\npragmatism\u2014are  very  important  to  success.  Furthermore,  political  commitment,  sense  of\nownership, and participation including that of women and disadvantaged groups in the design of\nreform  programs  are  significant  factors  for  success.  Public  consultations  and  continuous\ninformation dissemination are essential in promoting a general understanding of and support for\nthe aims of the reform program. There is a risk that reform decisions could be made at the\nmacro  level  without  considering  their  social  impact.  This  can  be  avoided  by  including\nidentification of social impact and gender issues, and mitigation of negative impacts as key\nelements in the EPSRP.  While various studies have identified the areas in need of reform and\nmade numerous recommendations, the TA is needed to bring together and incorporate the\nvarious  reform  components  in  a  comprehensive  framework  and  to  ensure  a  generally\nacceptable design through an ongoing consultative process. The gender-disaggregated social\nimpact of the proposed reform program must be assessed to obtain the basis for formulating\nproposals that minimize negative social consequences.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n15. The TA will advise the Government on the design of the EPSRP to enhance private-\nsector-led economic growth by (i) promoting policies that create an environment conducive to\nincreased investment and employment by the private sector, and (ii) improving the efficiency\nand effectiveness of service delivery by the public sector. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nB. Scope\n16. The  TA  will  assist  in  (i)  formulating  macroeconomic  policy  and  public  financial\nmanagement,  private  sector  development  and  public  enterprise  reform,  civil  service  and\nlegislative reform, and financial sector reforms; and in (ii) conducting social impact assessment,\nand consultative/participatory processes and public relations. It will (i) collate various policy and\nreform recommendations made by previous ADB-financed TAs and other external assistance\n                  \n9  Structural barriers to collateral-based credit for women will be examined in detail.\n10Knapman, B., and Saldanha, C. 1999.

Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $813,000 equivalent, comprising foreign\nexchange costs of $598,000 and local currency costs of $215,000 equivalent. ADB will finance\n$650,000  equivalent  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $598,000  and  $52,000\nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will contribute $163,000 equivalent in\nkind for office space, counterpart staff, local transportation, and other services. The TA will be\nfinanced by ADB on a grant basis, from the ADB-funded TA program. The TA will finance\ninternational  and  domestic  consulting  services,  civil  service  and  social  impact  assessment\nsurveys, workshops, conferences and national hearings. The cost estimates are in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n18. MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It will provide office space, adequate\ncounterpart staff, workshops and national summit venues, and local transportation. The reform\nsubcommittee of the Cabinet under the chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister will provide\noverall guidance in TA implementation. Workshops, conferences, and national hearings will be\nimplemented by the secretariat of the reform subcommittee. The TA will be implemented over\nabout 10 months (September 2001-June 2002) with intermittent assignment of the international\nconsultants. The TA will require 19 person-months of international and 3 person-months of\ndomestic  consultants  specializing  in  (i)  macroeconomics/public  finance,  (ii)  private  sector\ndevelopment/public enterprise reform, (iii) civil service reform, (iv) monetary economics/financial\nsector, (v) legal and regulatory review and drafting, (vi) social sector/social impact assessment,\n(vii)  participatory  methods/public  relations,  and  (viii)  other  specific  areas  (domestic  or\ninternational) as required (2 person-months). The consultant for public relations will be recruited\ninternationally if a qualified domestic consultant is not available. ADB will select and engage the\nteam of individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements acceptable to ADB for selecting and engaging of domestic consultants.\nThe terms of reference are in Appendix 3.\n19. The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report, (ii) an interim progress report, and\n(iii) a draft final report. The recommendations of the draft final report will be discussed at a\nconsultative meeting, involving ADB, MOF, consultants, and relevant stakeholders. Detailed\nreporting requirements are outlined in Appendix 3.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Tonga in an amount\nnot exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 for the purpose of advising on the Economic and\nPublic Sector Reform Program, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Sources of Information Assumptions and Risks\nMonitoring System\nDevelopment Goal\nThe standard of living of the population of Acceleration of economic growth rate \u2022  National statistical data\nTonga is improved through private-sector- above the historical trend of 1 percent\nled growth and an efficient and effective\npublic service.\nProject Purpose/Objectives\nThe Government implements a \u2022  Reduced cost of public service \u2022  National accounts \u2022  Government can mobilize financial\ncomprehensive economic and public \u2022  Improved balance of wage and resources required to complete the\nsector reform program (EPSRP) that is nonwage expenditures implementation of the reforms.\nbased on a broad consultative process. \u2022  Increased proportion of gross \u2022  Government ensures adequate\ndomestic product (GDP) generated technical capacity for reform\nby the private sector implementation.\n(R \u2022  Increased foreign and local private \u2022  The private sector responds\ne\nf sector investment positively to the favorable\ne\nr \u2022  Increased employment in private investment climate.\ne\nn sector enterprises Risk\nce \u2022  Private sector growth below\n in envisioned targets may lead to 6\n t weakening of political will to\ne\nx continue implementing the reform\nt\n:  program.\np\na\ng\ne\n 4 Output 1\n,\n p A  coherent  and  comprehensive  policy \u2022  Cabinet approval of the policy matrix \u2022  Cabinet decision \u2022  The political will for EPSRP\na\nra matrix  with  a  detailed  implementation will have been obtained by 2/2002. remains strong.\n.  schedule has been designed.
