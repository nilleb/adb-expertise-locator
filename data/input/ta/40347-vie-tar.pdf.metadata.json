The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  Viet  Nam\u2019s  ongoing  commitment  to  the \nequitable, effective and sustainable delivery of good-quality secondary education by 2015. During the \n2007 Country Program Confirmation mission, the Government of Viet Nam confirmed its request for \ntechnical assistance (TA) for preparation of the Secondary Education Sector Development Program \n(SESDP). The TA is included in the Country Strategy and Program 2007\u201320101 and the resulting loan \nis part of the 2009 lending program. A fact-finding mission to Viet Nam from 4 to 11 October 2007 \nreached  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  key  activities, \nimplementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and summary terms of references of \nthe consultants for the TA. The design and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1.2\n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Country Context. Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth has been remarkable with gross domestic \nproduct increasing by an average of about 7.5% yearly for the past fifteen years. According to the \nlatest household survey data, income poverty incidence fell from 58.1% in 1993 to 19.5% in 2004.3 \nThe  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  and  the  corresponding  customized  Viet  Nam \nDevelopment Goals (VDGs) are showing a strong positive trend. These successes have gradually \nshifted the focus of public services from equitable provision to the better quality of service required by \nan increasingly prosperous population. \n \n3.  The significant progress, however, has been mixed and is not as evident across regions and \namong vulnerable groups including ethnic minorities, girls and women. In 2004, poverty incidence was \nconsiderably higher in rural areas (26.4%) than in urban areas (13.7%). Ethnic disparity is even more \nstriking: 61% of all ethnic minorities were poor comprising 39% of the population living in poverty. The \nsocial indicators with respect to many of the MDGs and VDGs were worst for the vulnerable groups. \nThus, the Government is faced with the critical challenge of delivering social services to the most \ndisadvantaged groups in parallel with improving the quality and effectiveness of service provision. An \ninitial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Education Sector Performance. Increased public spending on education has significantly \nexpanded schooling: in School Year (SY) 2005 the net enrollment rate (NER) reached 97% for \nprimary  education,  90.4%  for  lower  secondary  education  (LSE),  and  63%  for  upper  secondary \neducation (USE).4 Having achieved near-universal primary education, the Government has committed \nto universal LSE by 2015. As with the poverty incidence, the high national NER for secondary \neducation masks a disparity in access and attainment by ethnicity, gender, and household income \nlevels. By 2006, only 34 out of 64 provinces had achieved universal LSE. Girls from poor families and \nespecially ethnic minorities are most disadvantaged. Mean years of schooling clearly illustrates the \ngender gap: ethnic minority girls complete only 4.5 mean years compared with 8.5 years for Kinh boys. \n \n5.  Secondary Education Sector Master Plans. In 2005, the Ministry of Education and Training \n(MOET) developed the Secondary Education Sector Master Plan (SESMP) 2006\u201320105 with the \nassistance of ADB, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), \nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). \nThe SESMP 2006\u20132010 was prepared based on result-based performance review in areas of access \nand equity; quality and relevance; and efficiency and sustainability. It set out to: (i) achieve NER of \n90% for LSE by 2010; (ii) improve the learning outcomes; and (iii) strengthen management capacity, \nas key targets. Since the middle of 2007, MOET and ADB have started an interim review of progress \nunder SESMP 2006\u20132010. The assessment has identified three core issues: (i) persistent inequality \nof access to schooling; (ii) weak system and strategies for improving the quality of teaching and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

These  issues  are  still \nunresolved and will require further inputs under the forthcoming SESMP 2011\u20132015. \n \n6.  Expanded Opportunities but Persistent Inequality of Access. The unresolved access and \nequity challenges are: (i) rapidly increasing demand for secondary education that cannot be met by \npublic  investment  alone  and  requires  promotion  of  non-public  provision,  accompanied  by \nestablishment of a quality control and accreditation system; (ii) the need for more financial support in \nthe form of scholarships and student loans, since only 1 in 7 needy families have been reached so far; \nand (iii) despite targeted support including provision of dormitories and school feeding programs by \nthe Government and ADB, inequality of access persists for families in the lowest income quintile, \nwhere school age children are major income earners. \n \n7.  The doi-moi (renewal) policy first allowed nonpublic provision of education in 1992. Since then, \nnonpublic schooling has played a significant role in expansion of access to education, particularly \nsecondary education. These nonpublic schools take in LSE graduates who either expect better quality \neducation than what public schools are able to offer or who are academically less successful at \nentering public schools. The Government has encouraged private secondary education. However, a \nsolid  legislative  framework  for  quality  assurance  and  accreditation  is  an  urgent  need  for  these \nnonpublic secondary schools. \n \n8.  The Government intends to widen access for poor students through fee exemptions and \nscholarships. However, the level of support is not enough to ease the financial burden for poor \nfamilies. Student loan can be a sustainable measure to expand schooling, but currently available only \nfor professional secondary education and higher education. A strategic policy for public financial \nsupports  must  be  developed.  As an  alternative  to  scholarships, conditional cash  transfer (CCT) \nprograms, which address the demand side, have been shown in other countries to substantially \nincrease the utilization of education services by disadvantaged groups. CCT programs defray the \nopportunity costs of children\u2019s education for poor families; however, they have yet to be introduced in \nViet Nam. \n \n9.  Weak Systems and Strategies for Quality Improvement. Significant investments have been \nmade by the Government and various donors to address the quality and relevance challenges. But \nthese investments are mostly pre- and in-service teacher training. Interventions in other critical areas \nsuch as curriculum revision, establishment of teacher standards and evaluation systems, and more \neffective textbook production and distribution have been limited. \n \n10.  ADB assisted MOET in revising the curriculum for LSE in 2002 and for USE in 2004 to \nimprove students\u2019 learning outcomes. However, the concept of \u201clearning outcomes\u201d6 is still not fully \nrecognized  in  Viet  Nam  as  consistent  with  the  standard  international  definition  of  educational \nattainments. As a result, the revised curriculum still strongly emphasizes memorized knowledge, \nrather than acquisition of analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a desirable attitude to learning \nrequired for competitive labor market. A system for the constant review of the curriculum content, \nrelevance, and application must be established. \n \n11.  MOET  is  keen  to  monitor  students\u2019  learning  outcomes  through  national  graduation \nexaminations. A valid and reliable assessment system to monitor the students\u2019 cognitive development \nhas yet to be developed. This compounds a problem of inequality of educational attainments: student \nacademic performance in disadvantaged areas is considerably lower than that of the national average. \nThis also makes it difficult to evaluate the competitiveness and readiness of secondary education \ngraduates  for  the  regional  labor  markets.  It  is  necessary  to  develop  a  more  comprehensive \nassessment system of the learning outcomes. \n \n                                                 \n6  The University of Warwick (2004) defines \u201clearning outcomes\u201d as (i) subject knowledge; (ii) subject-specific skills; (iii) \ncognitive skill; and (iv) key skills including problem solving, written and oral communication, numeracy, and working in the \nteam. OECD Programme for International student Assessment (PISA) assesses (i) mathematical literacy, (ii) problem \nsolving, (iii) reading literacy, and (iv) scientific literacy. \n ", "                3\n12.  Teacher standards must be developed and applied as a central component of the teaching \nperformance. There are as yet no teacher standards for LSE in Viet Nam. The promotion and reward \nsystem based on years of service should be replaced with a competitive system based on the merit \nand  capacity  of  teachers.  Such  a  system  will  also  provide  valuable  information  for  planning \nappropriate in-service support. \n \n13.  The  expensive  and  ineffective  textbook  production  and  distribution  is  a  concern  as  well. \nCurrently the state-owned publisher has monopolized writing, printing, and distribution of all the \ntextbooks. Although the National Education for All Action Plan has established the target of 30% of \nLSE students having access to a full set of free textbooks by 2015, the average price of textbooks in \nViet  Nam  is  considerably  higher  than  that  for  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) countries, and often not affordable for poor families. There is a need to improve \neffectiveness and sustainability of textbook production. \n \n14.  Lack of Accountability Framework. Limited capacity of education authorities and the lack of \nan  accountability  framework  are  key  obstacles  to  effective  service  delivery.  In  the  context  of \ndecentralization  of  responsibility  and  resources,  there  is  an  emerging  need  to  strengthen  the \ninstitutional capacity of MOET, the provincial departments of education and training (DOETs), the \ndistrict bureaus of education and training (BOETs) and other MOET-affiliated agencies. More strategic \npolicy on utilization of information and communication technology (ICT) is needed, particularly for the \neffective management and planning of service delivery. \n \n15.  Fundamental school quality level (FSQL) is one of three quality standards for public schools in \nViet  Nam:  the  other  two  are  national  standard  and  international  standard.  FSQL  guarantees  a \nminimum level of service delivery, and is applied mostly to poor schools. FSQL for LSE has been \ndeveloped under an ongoing ADB-financed project. With the expansion of USE in the rural areas, \nwhere quality control poses a greater challenge for USE than for LSE, FSQL must also be established \nfor USE. \n \n16.  Experience  of  ADB. ADB has been working closely with other development partners in \nleading the secondary education sub-sector. By supporting the Government with the development of \nthe SESMP 2006\u20132010, in collaboration with other donors, ADB has developed a strong partnership \nwith UNESCO, UNICEF, and JICA. Close collaboration has also been maintained with the World \nBank  which  is  the  lead  agency  in  the  primary  and  tertiary  education  sub-sectors  to  ensure  a \ncoordinated approach across the education sector. ADB has a current project portfolio of about $150 \nmillion including four ongoing loan projects, a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant, and \n$110  million  of  projects  in  the  pipeline  until  2010.7  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  investment  projects  have \ncontributed greatly to improving general coverage of access to schooling and the quality of teacher \ntraining. However, to deal with the foregoing unresolved challenges, a strategic secondary education \nsector development program needs to be developed. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The impact of the TA is improved learning outcomes in Viet Nam which are the result of \nstrategically planned and managed secondary education. Its outcome will be a mutually agreed \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 1999.

Proposed Policy Reform Agenda. The SESDP will address these key policy reforms: (i) a \nregulatory  framework  for  private  secondary  education  and  a  new  policy  framework  for  financial \nsupports for students including scholarships, student loans, and CCT; (ii) strengthening the quality \nassurance through development of LSE teacher standards and application of the standards for LSE \nand USE, reforms in the national examination system, textbook production, and review and revision of \nthe curriculum; and (iii) strengthening the accountability framework including development of the \nhuman resource management system for teachers, strategic policy on ICT in education, and FSQL for \nUSE. The SESDP policy reform program will be consistent with the key policy targets of the new \nSESMP 2010\u20132015. \n \n19.  Proposed  Investment  Project. To support the implementation of the policy reforms, the \nfollowing potential investments are proposed for the linked investment project: (i) the establishment of \nan  independent  agency  to  accredit  nonpublic  secondary  schools;  (ii)  the  provision  of  funds  for \nscholarships and student loans; (iii) a pilot study on CCT for selected disadvantaged groups; (iv) \ncapacity building for the new examination system to support assessment reform; (v) the provision of \ntraining for more effective textbooks production; and (vi) provision of management training for (a) the \ndevelopment of LSE teacher standards and the effective application of teacher standards for LSE and \nUSE; (b) the new human resource management system for teachers and education administrators; (c) \nthe use of ICT in education planning and management; and (d) the development of FSQL for USE. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n20.  Outputs and Key Activities. The TA outputs will be a design of an SDP including draft \ngovernment policy reform actions and a feasibility study of the investment project agreed to by the \nGovernment  and  ADB  for  secondary  education.  A  program  design  will  identify  technically  and \neconomically feasible policy goals and monitorable actions, along with an accompanying investment \ncomponent that will support the implementation of these policies. The TA will develop detailed design \nand strategies for the following: \n \n(i)  pilot initiatives that address the access and equity challenges including: (a) a new \nlegislative framework for the quality control of nonpublic secondary schooling, (b) pro-\npoor scholarship and students loans, and (c) a pilot CCT proposal; \n(ii)  a program to mitigate quality and relevance challenges including: (a) the systematic \nreview and revision of the secondary curriculum, (b) valid and reliable examinations \nand evaluation, (c) teacher standards for merit-based human resource management, \nand (d) effective and sustainable textbook production and distribution; and \n(iii)  an accountability framework for managing the efficiency and sustainability challenges \nincluding:  (a)  the  assessment  and  development  of  the  institutional  capacity  of \neducation  authorities,  (b)  strategic  policy  on  ICT  for  education  quality  and \nmanagement; and (c) the development of FSQL for USE. \n \n21.  Methodologies and Approaches. The TA will (i) analyze key policy measures in the three \npriority  areas\u2014access  and  equity,  quality  and  relevance,  and  efficiency  and  sustainability\u2014and \nidentify  areas  where  further  developments  are  planned  and  needed;  (ii)  conduct  extensive \nconsultations within the Government and among other stakeholders on the priorities for policy reform \nand capacity development for the monitoring and governance policy implementation and associated \ninvestments; (iii) provide technical support to key stakeholders in ongoing policy development work; \nand (iv) prepare a policy matrix, an investment proposal, and an implementation plan for possible \nassistance from ADB and other development partners including UNESCO, UNICEF, the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID), and the Korean Export Import Bank, who have \nexpressed interest in cofinancing the project. \n \n22.  Assumptions and Risks. The successful implementation of the TA assumes the following: (i) \nMOET continues to give priority to the effective sustainable delivery of quality secondary education; (ii) \n ", "                5\nMOET and local education authorities reach consensus on the proposed policy reforms; (iii) the TA \nimplementation unit has qualified staff to carry out the project activities; and (iv) local communities are \naware of the need for secondary schooling. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n23.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $770,000. ADB will provide $600,000 equivalent on a \ngrant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The remaining \n$170,000 will be contributed by the Government and will include office accommodation, utilities, \nremuneration  and  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff,  local  transportation  for  support  staff,  and \nadministration support. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  Project Management and Quality Assurance. MOET will be the Executing Agency and will \nprovide the counterpart support including a qualified TA project manager and project staff acceptable \nto  ADB.  The  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  will  be  established  in  MOET  composed  of \nrepresentatives from the relevant departments and institutes of MOET and other concerned agencies. \nDOETs and BOETs will be the implementation agencies for the TA. ADB, UNESCO, UNICEF, AusAID, \nand the Korean Export Import Bank will form the Donor Advisory Group, which will give technical \nadvice on the policy reform matrix and investment project to be developed under the TA. \n \n25.  Consulting Services. An international consulting firm in association with national consultants \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The selection and engagement of the international consulting firm will be done \nthrough quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) using simplified technical proposal. The QCBS \nweighting will follow the standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20. The TA will provide a total 55 person-\nmonths (pm) consulting services (17 international and 38 national pm). Outline terms of reference for \nconsultants is in Appendix 4. All-TA financed goods will be procured in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n26.  Implementation Period and Reporting Requirements. The TA will be implemented in three \nphases over 10 months, tentatively from May 2008 to February 2009. The first phase will be 6.5 \nmonths. At the middle of month 5, the midterm workshop will be organized to discuss and obtain \nconsensus on the basic design and scope of the policy reform program and the investment project. A \ntripartite meeting is scheduled in the middle of month 6 based on the draft TA final report/initial draft \ninvestment report (IR). The second phase will be from the middle of month 6 to middle of month 9 \nduring TA Implementation. Selected national consultants will help PMU collect additional data, finalize \ncost-table, and incorporate the inter-ministerial comments. In the third phase, the appraisal workshop \nfor the TA final report/final draft IR will be organized jointly by the Government and ADB in the middle \nof month 9. The revised IR will be submitted to the Government in month 10. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the provision \nof technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the Government \nof Viet Nam for preparing the Secondary Education Sector Development Program, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Data Sources/   \nPerformance \nDesign Summary  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks  \nTargets/Indicators \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nImproved learning outcomes in Viet  Lower secondary education  Viet Nam Living  \u2022 The Government \nNam, as a result of strategically  (LSE) net enrolment rate  Standard Survey  continues to be \nplanned and managed secondary  improves from 82.6% in school  by the Government  committed to stable \neducation  year SY2005/2006 to 90% in  Statistics Office  socioeconomic \nSY2015/2016    development through \n    responsive human \nThe proportion of secondary  MOET annual  resources \nstudents successfully passing  education statistics  development is \nthe National Grade 12  reports  sustained. \nGraduation Examination     \nincreases from 80.4% in  \u2022 Key stakeholders, \nSY2006/2007 to 90 % in  particularly the local \nSY2015/2016  education authorities, \n  sustain their \nThe state expenditure for  commitment to and \neducation increases steadily but  ownership of the \nat sustainable level, from 6% in  structural reforms and \n2010 to 6.5% in 2015 50, and  required capacity \nthe education share of public  development.  \nexpenditure will be retained at \n20 % from 2010 to 2015. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nA mutually agreed design of a sector  Memorandum of understanding  Memorandum of  \u2022 MOET\u2019s commitment to \ndevelopment program comprising a  for the loan fact-finding mission  understanding for  effective sustainable \npolicy reform program and an  signed by the Government and  the loan appraisal  delivery of good quality \ninvestment project that aims to  ADB by the end of month 9  mission  secondary education \ndeliver equitable and good quality      continues to be a priority in \nsecondary education by 2015  Investment report approved by  Investment report  the education and training \n  the Government by end month  sector. \n10   \n\u2022 Local education authorities \nare aware of the need for \nthe policy reform and \ncapacity development. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \nDraft SESDP including government  By month 5, the Government,    \u2022 The project implementation \npolicy reform actions and a  ADB, and other key    unit has qualified staff to \nfeasibility study of the investment  stakeholders agree on:     carry out the project \nproject which will develop detailed      activities. \ndesign and strategies for the  \u2022 detailed policy goals with  Midterm workshop,  \u2022 A consensus of the \nfollowing:   target years and its  midterm report, and  proposed policy reform is \n  monitoring and evaluation  signed aide  built by MOET and local \n(cid:121) pilot initiatives to improve access  indicators;

POVERTY ISSUES \n \nA.    Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.   Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy \nof the partner country. \n \nThe Government of Viet Nam recognizes secondary education as one of the principal mechanisms for economic \ngrowth and the achievement the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Viet Nam Development Goals \n(VDGs). The 5-year Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 targets universal secondary education as a key \npriority. Special emphasis is placed on reaching ethnic minorities in remote areas for equitable and inclusive \ndevelopment. Access to secondary schooling has expanded significantly in recent years, but national averages mask \nsignificant disparities in enrolments, which are unevenly distributed by ethnic group, gender, and socioeconomic \nstatus. Detailed poverty analysis conducted under the Lower Secondary Education for the Most Disadvantaged \nRegions Project in 2007 shows that household income is strongly correlated with educational attainment. Ethnic \nminority and particularly girls, remain the most disadvantaged. They have for not benefited from expanding economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction and risk falling further behind if secondary education remains out of reach. \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.    Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs \n2.    Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe Government has committed to universal secondary education in support of the country\u2019s social and economic \ndevelopment. The Project is aimed at achieving universal lower secondary education as a part of basic education and \ngender parity in basic education (MDGs 2 and 3). \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n  1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \nThe PPTA poverty impact analysis will focus on the links between increased access to secondary education and \npoverty reduction, using the most recent household survey data. \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \n \nInternational and national ethnic minority and gender specialists will be recruited for poverty analysis. \n \n3.    If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe TA will undertake social and poverty analysis particularly to identify target areas for the investment project, and \nfor the proposed pilot conditional cash transfer. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \n \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n \n1.    Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project? \n \n ", " 10  Appendix 2 \nThe primary beneficiaries will be the whole secondary education\u2013eligible cohort, which will have better access to \nsecondary schooling and good quality teaching and learning. \n2.    What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nMore strategically planned and managed secondary education provision with improved learning outcomes. \n \n3.    What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the Project \naddress them? \n \n  Potential constraints and risks are (i) effective sustainable delivery of quality secondary education might not continue \nto be a MOET priority in the education sector; (ii) local education authorities might not be aware of the need for the \npolicy reform and capacity development; (iii) the TA implementation unit might not have qualified staff to carry out the \nproject activities; (iv) local communities might not become aware of the need for and importance of secondary \nschooling; and (v) key MOET affiliates might not be committed to more effective service delivery of better quality \neducational inputs. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.   Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \n  Central and local education planners, managers, teachers, and secondary education age cohorts will be the potential \ninitial  stakeholders.  Education  planners  and  managers  will  be  involved  in  the  Project  both  as  the \nExecutive/Implementing Agencies and beneficiaries of the project activities. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g. \nworkshops, community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \n \nNationwide workshops and consultation meetings with local stakeholders are planned to (i) assess and develop \nthe  capacities  of  stakeholders;  and  (ii)  facilitate  their  participation  in  the  design  of  the  Project  through \nidentification of the structural problems of education service delivery and the development of the policy reform \nmatrix to address these issues.   \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n \n    Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n \nA gender imbalance in educational attainment still exists. fewer girls than boys are enrolled at all levels of the \neducation  system  except  for  professional  secondary  education.  A  small  but  significant  gender  gap  in \nenrollment at both primary education and LSE levels has not improved significantly over the last five years.1 \nMean years of schooling starkly illustrate this gap; on average, girls complete only 5.6 years of schooling as \ncompared to 6.8 years for boys. This gap widens dramatically when ethnicity is factored in: Kinh boys achieve \n8.5 mean years of schooling, compared with just 4.5 years for ethnic minority girls. Improved girl-friendly \nschool facilities and awareness raising campaign among parents on the benefits of educating their daughters \nwill help reduce this imbalance. \n \n2.  Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?   \n \n    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \n3.   Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n \n    Yes          No    Please explain. \n \n                                                 \n1  MOET. 2005.
