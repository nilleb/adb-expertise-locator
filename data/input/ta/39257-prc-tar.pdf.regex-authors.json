During the Country Programming Mission from 27 November to 1 December 2006, the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide a technical assistance (TA) facility to support flexible and timely responses to \nemerging policy and capacity development needs. The TA facility would support key policy \nreforms and/or development of new mechanisms to better implement existing policies, as well \nas capacity building to support policy directions under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan for Economic \nand Social  Development (11th FYP; 2006  to  2010). Fact-finding discussions with  the  two \nexecuting agencies (EAs)\u2014the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and State Council Leading Group \nOffice of Poverty Alleviation and Development (LGOP)\u2014reached agreement on the impact, \noutcome, scope, and implementation arrangements. Inclusion of the TA (renamed the Facility \nfor Policy Reform and Poverty Reduction1) in the 2007 pipeline and an increased funding \namount were confirmed during the April 2007 Country Program Midterm Review Mission. \n \n2..  The TA facility mechanism has provided an important tool that enhances ADB\u2019s ability to \nquickly and flexibly respond to urgent policy and capacity building issues, including those not \ncovered in the regular TA pipeline. Three prior TA facilities2 undertaken in the PRC have \nallowed ADB to work with government, academic and research institutions, nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and other partners to undertake a range of focused initiatives to address \nspecific policy reform and capacity building needs. Building on this successful cooperation, the \nproposed TA facility would flexibly address emerging challenges and priorities as the PRC nears \nthe midpoint of 11th FYP implementation. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3..  In view of the PRC\u2019s past achievements and changes in the development context, \nincluding existing and newly emerging challenges, the 11th FYP and related policy directions\u2014\nestablished by the PRC leadership at the highest levels\u2014represent an important new paradigm \nfocused on creating a harmonious society through balanced and people-centered development. \nThe 11th FYP sets out key priorities, including (i) transforming the economic growth model to \nraise efficiency, conserve resources, and protect the environment; (ii) adjusting and improving \nindustrial structure; (iii) rural development, under the concept of constructing a \u201csocialist new \nrurality\u201d; (iv) enhancing equity and social development; (v) coordinating development across \nregions; and (vi) deepening legal and governance reform. More broadly, the new paradigm \nreflected in the 11th FYP and related declarations explicitly recognizes the need to address \ncritical gaps and imbalances, including between economic and social development, rural and \nurban areas, western and coastal regions, and poor and more affluent populations.   \n \n4..  Achieving the directions and targets set under the 11th FYP will require innovative new \napproaches  in  areas  ranging  from  economic  and  fiscal  policy  to  social  development  and \nenvironmental protection. At the same time, the Government also increasingly recognizes the \nneed to resolve challenges surrounding the country\u2019s remaining poverty, which is fundamental \nto achievement of social harmony. This will require more targeted and innovative approaches in \norder to address a new national poverty context, which include (i) persistent absolute poverty, \n                                                 \n1 The TA, initially titled Facility for Reform Support and Capacity Building II, first appeared in ADB Business \nOpportunities on 9 January 2007. \n2  ADB. 2003. Support to the PRC for A Fund for Strategic Policy Conferences and Studies for Poverty Reduction. \nManila (executed by LGOP); ADB. 2004. Support to the PRC for A Facility for Policy Reform Support.

The Government views the flexible facility mechanism and the proposed TA as an \neffective means to support its work to address the development challenges noted above, and to \ncontribute to establishment of a more harmonious society. The facility approach is particularly \nimportant in light of (i) possible increasing diversification of the PRC\u2019s TA needs in order to \nsupport new priority areas under the 11th FYP; and (ii) in view of the Government\u2019s desire for \nmore timely implementation, enhanced EA ownership, and more effective follow-through. The \nproposed TA facility provides a foundation for continued cooperation in supporting reforms in \napproaches  to  poverty  reduction  and  other  economic  and  social  development  issues  and \npriorities set out under the 11th FYP, the China Rural Poverty Alleviation and Development \nOutline (2001\u20132010) and other related directives. It also builds on cooperation with the United \nKingdom  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  under  the  first  TA  facility  (see \nfootnote 2) and the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRF), and will encourage information \nsharing and dialogue with other international organizations. In addition to work with national-\nlevel entities and policy dialogue, it will also engage subnational (especially provincial) entities, \nand strengthen the capacity of provincial governments to implement central government policies \nand  new  directions  under  the  11th  FYP  (e.g.,  resource-saving  and  clean  development). \nCapacity building will also support EAs for proposed, current, or recently completed advisory \nTAs to ensure effective implementation and/or follow-through.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6..  The long-term impact supported by the TA will be achievement of the objectives of the \n11th FYP, with a sound framework of policy, legislation, and implementation mechanisms and \ncapacity in place to support continued economic and social development under subsequent \nFYPs. The outcome of the TA will be a series of recommendations on policy reform, supportive \nlegislation,  institutional  change,  and  effective  implementation  mechanisms  provided  for \nconsideration by the Government, along with capacity building in priority areas.    \n \n7..  Policy recommendations are expected to be reflected in policy reforms or refinements \nduring and/or after TA implementation. Priority areas for capacity-building subcomponents will \ninclude linkage to the implementation of key policies and/or complementarity to other advisory \nTAs, as noted above. As outlined below, a portion of TA facility support will be earmarked for \npoverty reduction interventions to address key issues and make strategic recommendations for \nreducing  poverty  (broadly  defined).  Subcomponents  will  support  policy  dialogue  between \ngovernment agencies, civil society, academia, and the international community. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8..  To support achievement of the outcome and contribute to the long-term impact, the key \noutputs of the TA will be:  \n(i)    a series of studies (one per policy-related subcomponent) assessing and providing \nconcrete recommendations for priority policy issues;  \n ", "3 \n(ii)    a series of activity reports (one per capacity-building subcomponent) outlining the key \nrationale and gaps addressed, processes, and outcomes, with resource materials \nattached to support replication and/or follow-up capacity-building activities; and  \n(iii)  for each subcomponent, a self-contained focused synopsis monograph (see Appendix \n2) that distills the key issues (e.g., gaps in policy, operational mechanisms, and/or \nimplementation  capacities)  and  recommendations  (e.g.,  proposed  reforms  and/or \noperational mechanisms to support more effective policy, or practical lessons from \ncapacity-building approaches and recommendations for future programs).  \n \nWhile deliverables under (i) and (ii) may be produced solely in Chinese (if justified), the high \nquality focused synopses will be produced in both Chinese and English.   \n \n9..  The TA will allow ADB to provide timely support for PRC reform processes and capacity \nbuilding, and its design provides a flexible framework, including allowing selection of some \nsubcomponents during TA implementation. ADB and the EAs will jointly select subcomponents \nto provide timely support to emerging Government reform and capacity building priorities in \nthose  areas  (i)  where  ADB\u2019s  involvement  is  expected  to  have  substantial  impact  on \ndevelopment, refinement, and/or operationalization of national policy; (ii) that are consistent with \nthe existing country strategy and program update (CSPU) and subsequent country partnership \nstrategy  (CPS)  for  2008\u20132010;  and  (iii)  that  are  complementary  to  ADB  lending  and  TA \noperations. Selection criteria will include the following: (i) support to priority Government policy \nreforms and close linkages to directions identified under the 11th FYP; (ii) consistency with the \nCSPU and/or dialogue towards the new CPS, and ability to contribute to existing or emerging \nniche areas of ADB-PRC cooperation, where ADB involvement has the potential to make a \nsignificant contribution; and (iii) evidence of strong PRC ownership such that a small amount of \nstrategic ADB assistance will help advance or better implement important reforms.3 Policy-\nrelated activities may include formulation and/or amendment of policies, laws, regulations, and \ndesign or refinement of institutional structures, operational procedures, and capacity-building \nmechanisms. Capacity-building subcomponents will be selected based on their potential to \nadvance  PRC-ADB  cooperation  in  promote  reforms  (including  through  enhanced  project \nmanagement for advisory TA projects, and/or implementation and follow-through).  \n \n10..  TA activities will be divided into two components, overseen by separate EAs (see below), \nwith each component contributing in parallel to the outputs noted above.  \n \n11..   Component  1:  Sectoral  Policy  Studies  and  Capacity  Building.  Under  this \ncomponent, to be executed by MOF (indicatively $500,000), three subcomponents have been \nindicatively identified for initial funding,4 as outlined in Appendix 3: \n(i)    Dissemination of ADB TA Best Practice ($40,000); \n(ii)    Study on Beijing-Hebei Water Resource Compensation Mechanisms and Approaches \n($50,000); and \n(iii)   Scale-up and Policy Framework for Supporting Left-behind Children ($50,000).  \n \n12..   Component 2: Support for Innovations in Poverty Reduction. Under this component, \nto be executed by LGOP (indicatively $465,000), four subcomponents have been indicatively \nidentified (see footnote 4) for initial funding: \n                                                 \n3 Examples include requests for support where the proponent has been mandated to submit a policy note to the State \n \nCouncil or other agencies, and topics linked to the FYP and CPS and slated for legislative review within the year. \n4 Additional subcomponents may be added to those initially identified (for both components), if jointly agreed after TA \napproval. \n  ", "4   \n(i)    Model Development and Pilot Testing of Village Poverty Reduction Cooperatives in \nYunnan and Hebei ($150,000);    \n(ii)    Pilot  Testing  and  Plan  Design  for  Mobilizing  PRC  Poverty  Reduction  Volunteers \n($50,000);   \n(iii)  Technical Design for a Poverty Reduction and Public Goods Information Web-based \nNetwork ($50,000); and   \n(iv)  Research on Models for Technology-based Poverty Reduction in Different Ecological \nZones ($30,000). \n \n13..  ADB and the relevant EA will jointly select other subcomponents for each component, \ntentatively including a final subcomponent to produce a concise synthesis monograph (in both \nprint and electronic format) that compiles and supports dissemination of key achievements, \nlessons, and policy implications. Subcomponents will typically include conferences to discuss \nkey issues and build consensus, capacity-building seminars, and/or other workshops involving \nparticipants from government agencies, the private sector, NGOs, and/or international agencies. \nThese workshops, in conjunction with distribution of core subcomponent outputs (see para. 8) in \nhardcopy and via the Internet, will serve to disseminate information and subcomponent findings. \n    \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14..      The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,215,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$965,000 equivalent on a grant basis, including $900,000 under ADB\u2019s TA funding program and \n$65,000 (earmarked for component 2) cofinanced from the PRF, source-funded by DFID and \nadministered by ADB. The Government will contribute $250,000 equivalent in-kind for office \nspace, counterpart staff, honoraria, and other miscellaneous services; implementing agency (IA) \nmanagement fees, overhead, or related costs such as staff salaries and allowances and use of \nIA  resources  (e.g.,  office  accommodation)  will  also  be  viewed  as  part  of  the  counterpart \ncontribution. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4, and estimated budgets \nfor  indicative  initial  subcomponents  are  noted  above.  Subsequent  subcomponents  will  be \nsubject to budget categories identified in Appendix 4 and to a maximum allocation of $50,000, \nunless this ceiling is waived by the relevant EA and ADB; the latter may also agree to adjust \nsubcomponent budgets in special cases, in dialogue with the IA.   \n \n15..  The cost estimate is based on engaging expert inputs (see para. 18) equivalent to a total \nof 6.5 person-months of international expert inputs and 60 person-months of domestic expert \ninputs.  TA  support  for  workshops  may  include  costs  related  to  venue,  equipment  rental, \ntranslation, printing and copying, food and non-alcoholic beverages, transportation and lodging, \nlogistics and administration support, and other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. \nSubcomponents may also fund surveys, field investigations, and purchase of required resource \nmaterials, based on costed proposals agreed upon by ADB.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16..   The TA will be implemented from June 2007 through June 2009. MOF and LGOP will \nact  as  parallel  EAs  for  the  TA,  with  MOF  responsible  for  oversight  and  coordination  of            \nsubcomponents of component 1, and LGOP for poverty-related initiatives under component 2. \nTo ensure effective coordination, ADB and the EAs will tentatively meet quarterly (or as needed) \nto review progress and discuss additional subcomponent candidates. Within MOF, the TA \nDivision of the International Department will act as focal point for the TA. LGOP will establish \nspecial project implementation and management teams and a special work group within the \nDepartment of International Cooperation and Social Poverty Reduction to provide oversight and \n ", "5 \ncoordination of poverty-related subcomponents. LGOP will also promote information exchange \nduring the TA and dissemination of subcomponent findings, which may include establishment of \na special website and publication using various media, with support provided under the TA.  \n \n17..  ADB and the relevant EA will jointly agree on IAs for subcomponents (generally the \nconcept paper proponent), which may include government organizations, various institutions, \nNGOs, and, in special cases, a unit within the EA or ADB. For each agreed subcomponent, the \nIA will assume overall responsibility for ensuring coordination and the timely delivery of quality \noutputs. It will identify a focal point to provide working-level inputs throughout the subcomponent, \nincluding (i) supporting implementation and policy-related dialogue, including liaising with the EA, \nADB, and other key actors and decision makers; (ii) identifying and proposing to ADB and the \nEA external sub-component experts (see below) and coordinating their inputs; (iii) proposing to \nthe EA and ADB any needed changes in subcomponent scope or approaches, based on \ndiscussion with the experts. ADB will monitor, and in some cases directly contribute to, TA \nprogress and outputs, and will conduct policy discussions with relevant government agencies. \nThe ADB PRC Resident Mission (PRCM) will administer the TA, with contributions (and/or \nmanagement of some subcomponents) provided by counterparts at ADB headquarters, based \non their technical strengths and complementarity between the TA and other ADB programs.  \n \n18..  ADB will work with the Government to identify national (60 person-months equivalent) \nand international (6.5 person-months equivalent) experts to provide inputs as formal consultants, \nshort-term  resource  persons,  and  task-specific  experts.  Required  expertise  and  terms  of \nreference,  including  duration  and  expected  results,  will  be  endorsed  by  ADB  when \nsubcomponents are jointly identified, or during implementation. ADB will recruit consultants as \nindividuals, in dialogue with the relevant EA and/or IA, and in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). Additional resource persons and \ntask-specific experts will carry out well-defined tasks (e.g., preparation of case study papers, \nworkshop presentations, participation in workshops, and reviews of draft reports). ADB will \ndisburse funds linked to other activity expenditures based on costed work plans submitted by \nthe IA and jointly reviewed by the relevant EA: unless otherwise agreed, disbursement will be \ndirectly to IAs, and in all cases IAs will provide documentation to liquidate actual expenditures to \nADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants, \n(1992, as amended from time to time). To facilitate implementation, ADB may establish an \nadvance payment facility for EAs and IAs as needed and/or utilize direct payment (e.g., to \nworkshop venues). PRCM will provide an orientation5 to ensure IAs clearly understand the \nprocedures. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION   \n19..  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $65,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for Facility for Policy Reform and Poverty Reduction, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n5 Outside of subcomponent budgets, the TA may fund travel-related costs for participation by non-Beijing IAs in \norientation sessions. \n  ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact  Targets and directions set  Government annual work  Assumptions \nAchievement of aims set  out in the Eleventh FYP  reports and other documents;  Government prioritization of \n(cid:122) \ndown in the Eleventh FYP  for 2006-2010,  media reporting; legislation,  balanced, people-centered \n(2006\u20132010), with a  particularly:  institutional reform, and policy  development and social \nsound framework of  per capita GDP rises  pronouncements.  harmony maintained or \n(cid:122) \npolicy, legislation, and  6.6% annually (5%  for  increased. \nimplementation  rural incomes);  Policies and new directions \n(cid:122) \nmechanisms and  water used per unit of  are effectively \n(cid:122) \ncapacities in place to  industrial value-added  implemented. \nsupport continued  falls 30%;   \neconomic and social  cooperative medical \n(cid:122) \ndevelopment under  system reaches at \nsubsequent FYPs.   least 80% of rural \n  population, 45 million \nmigrants trained, and \nrelated system \nimprovements;  \nnew systems in place \n(cid:122) \nfor (i) civil society \nparticipation in rural \npoverty alleviation and \ndevelopment, and (ii) \nrural social safety net.  \nOutcome  Key subcomponent  Government documents and  Assumption \nA series of  findings reflected in  statements on policy  Policy notes are endorsed \n(cid:122) \nrecommendations on  national policy dialogue,  directions; media reports;  by EA for senior-level \npolicy reform, supportive  disseminated to multiple  ADB issuance of  review.  \nlegislation, institutional  stakeholders, and core  Observations and   \nchange, and  capacities built.
