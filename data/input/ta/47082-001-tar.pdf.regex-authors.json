INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  2011\u20132020  Strategic  Framework  for  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Program (CAREC 2020) has two strategic objectives: expanding trade \nand improving industrial competitiveness. Within CAREC 2020, trade facilitation is one of four \npriority sectors. Work in this area was guided by the Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy \n(TTFS), approved in 2007 by the 6th CAREC Ministerial Conference. The TTFS has undergone \na midterm review during 2012-2013 to optimize its implementation for the remaining period \n(2014-2020). As a result, a Refined TTFS 2020 and Implementation Action Plan has been \ndeveloped and approved in 2013 by the 12th CAREC Ministerial Conference on 23-24 October \nin Astana, Kazakhstan. The refined TTFS strengthens an integrated approach, focusing on the \ndevelopment of six CAREC corridors through infrastructure investments and trade facilitation \ninitiatives to improve the movement of goods and people through and across these corridors.  \n \n2.  Customs cooperation has been central to CAREC trade facilitation efforts since CAREC \nwas established in 2001. The CAREC customs cooperation committee (CCC), composed of the \nheads of its 10 member country customs administrations, serves as the regional forum for \naddressing issues of common interest in this area.  \n \n3.  The  CCC  is  concentrating  its  cooperation  work  on  (i)  simplifying  and  harmonizing \ncustoms  procedures  and  documentation;  (ii)  upgrading  information  and  communication \ntechnology for customs modernization and data exchange, (iii) enhancing risk management and \npost-entry  audit,  (iv)  implementing joint customs  control (JCC),  and  (v)  facilitating  regional \ntransit. These priority areas are consistent with the 10 building blocks for developing customs in \nthe  21st  century  being  promoted  by  the  World  Customs  Organization  (WCO),  whose  179 \nmember countries account for 98% of global trade. The proposed regional technical assistance \n(TA) will provide support in one of the five CCC priority areas1: the implementation of joint \ncustoms control.2  \n \n4.  During the 12th meeting of the CCC in Astana, Kazakhstan on 18 September 2013, \nmembers discussed the three proposed TA projects, agreed that they aligned with CAREC \nobjectives in the priority areas, and gave them full support. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Corridor  performance  measurement  and  monitoring  (CPMM) 3  assesses  transport \nefficiency along the six corridors defined in the TTFS. Travel time and cost data are collected for \neach corridor by a network of road carrier and freight forwarder associations and analyzed to \nidentify problems. CPMM reveals consistently that border crossing points (BCPs) constitute the \nmajor bottleneck and obstacle to better international transport and trade in the CAREC region. \nThe complex and often repetitive clearance procedures of customs and other agencies on both \nsides of the border conspire with inadequate infrastructure to create these bottlenecks. In the \nthird quarter of 2013, CPMM revealed that a 687 km journey along CAREC Corridor 2 took 48 \nhours, with 32 of those hours consumed by activities and delays along the route, principally at \nBCPs. These delays contributed to an average 50% reduction of speed in transit (from 47 kph \n                                                 \n1  Priority (i), (ii) and (iii) will be supported by TA \u2018Aligning trade facilitation measures with best practices\u201d while priority \n(v)  will be supported by TA \u201cFacilitation of Regional Transit Trade in Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC)\u201d. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 October 2013. \n3  CPMM has been conducted continuously since 2009. It identifies border crossing points where road carriers and \nfreight forwarders encounter the greatest delays. \n ", "2  \nwithout delays to 23 kph taking these delays into account). Before remedial measures can be \ndesigned, however, more detailed investigation and analysis of the specific border clearance \nproblems and their causes need to be undertaken. \n \n6.  This  should  be  done  through  use  of  the  time  release  study  (TRS)  methodology \ndeveloped by the WCO to review the effectiveness of administrative procedures not only of \ncustoms services but also of other border control agencies. The TRS method will help identify \nthe specific causes of delays and recommend the measures customs authorities and other \nborder control agencies need to take to address them. Three CAREC members (Kazakhstan, \nMongolia, and Uzbekistan) have put the TRS process to work, but more effort is needed to \nexpand the use of and the capacity to implement periodic TRS analysis in the CAREC countries \nso that progress on improving border control and clearance procedures can be monitored and \ninformation gathered on which to base reforms and modernization. CPMM data can aid customs \nofficials in fine-tuning their conduct of TRS. \n \n7.  Multiple inspections currently take place at CAREC BCPs, involving numerous services \nand agencies responsible for border controls on both sides to the frontier. How these border \nagencies operate and are organized and coordinated is an important factor in addressing the \npotential negative impacts of the growing international mobility of goods and people, including \nthe risks of human trafficking and the spread of communicable diseases. This has created new \nchallenges for governments seeking to organize border management in an effective way. \n \n8.  The WCO identifies JCC as a preliminary step toward coordinated border management \n(CBM). CBM aims to strengthen the ability of multiple border agencies to facilitate trade and the \nmovement of goods across borders while also addressing the potential negative impacts. It has \ntwo  dimensions.  Nationally,  governments  need  to  develop  cooperation  and  arrangements \nbetween the domestic agencies involved in regulating and controlling international trade. This \napplies  in  particular  to  customs  services,  inspection  and  quarantine  agencies,  transport \nministries, national police, and immigration authorities. The international dimension requires that \nborder control agencies in one country work with their foreign counterparts on the other side of a \nfrontier to maximize the harmonization of border control functions. \n \n9.  JCC  pilots  have  been  conducted  with  ADB\u2019s  assistance  since  December  2007  at \nselected BCPs to address serious delays in cross-border movement of goods between the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia along two CAREC corridors.4 CAREC \nhas adopted a three-phased approach to JCC: (i) document harmonization, which requires the \nimporter and exporter to use the same customs declaration on both sides of a border; (ii) mutual \nrecognition of inspection results at both sides of the border; and (iii) joint border operation, \nwhere customs authorities on each side of the border coordinate operations. The JCC pilots \nhave focused on the first phase on harmonization of cargo manifests. During the next 2\u20133 years, \nCAREC needs to scale up JCC by (i) analyzing lessons learned; (ii) intensifying JCC by moving \ntoward  the  electronic  exchange  of  harmonized  cargo  manifests  and  mutual  recognition  of \ninspection results; and (iii) expanding JCC to more BCPs in more member countries.  \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The TA will support TRS analyses to establish the causes of cross-border delays related \nto border control and clearance procedures. It will also help expand the number and scope of \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "  3\nJCC pilots and support the efforts of CAREC countries to improve coordination between their \nborder control agencies both at the national and international level and move toward CBM. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be an improved movement of legitimate goods and people \nacross CAREC borders. The outcome will be enhanced coordination and cooperation between \nborder control authorities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the delivery of the following \noutputs and activities: \n \n(i)  Time release studies and training conducted. Country-based workshops and \ntraining on the TRS methodology will be conducted to adapt TRS tools to specific \ncountry  needs.  TRS  committees  will  be  set  up  to  design  customized  TRS \nquestionnaires. In addition, TRS analyses will be conducted at problem BCPs \nidentified through the CPMM. The results will (a) identify major problems and \nbottlenecks; and (b) set up indicators against which to measure performance \nimprovements. Action plans will be put in place with recommendations on steps \nfor customs authorities to take to address problems identified. Consultations \nbetween customs agencies will be organized to discuss common problems and \nagree  on  regional  cooperative  measures.  It  is  advised  to  conduct  TRS \nperiodically so further reforms can be designed as problems are identified. In this \nregard,  guidelines  will  be  developed  to  help  institutionalize  periodic  TRS  in \nCAREC countries. \n(ii)  Joint customs control review and pilot expansion. JCC generates significant \nsavings  in  financial  and  human  resources.  CCC  members  have  expressed \ninterest in establishing JCC along their borders. The TA will support case studies  \nto document success factors and guidelines for JCC operations will be developed \nbased on the pilot experience. They will include a framework for expanding the \nscope of JCC to cover CBM principles. The results of the case studies will be \nused to identify new BCPs where pilots can be developed. The TA will also \nsupport the efforts of CAREC customs authorities to expand the current JCC \npilots to test phases 2 and 3 of the JCC approach. \n(iii)  Improved interagency coordination for coordinated border management. \nBorder management has become complex because of the many state agencies \ninvolved. CBM calls for cooperation between relevant border control agencies \n(para. 8). The TA will help CAREC countries to explore more effective solutions \nto border management. It will develop recommendations for establishing better \nlinks and coordination between the procedures and systems of border agencies \nand harmonizing and simplifying these procedures and systems, where possible. \nTo this end, coordination and dialogue meetings between customs and other \nborder agencies will be arranged to discuss common information needs, and the \npossibility of harmonizing border control documents and coordinated electronic \nsubmissions.  The  TA  will  support  efforts  at  the  national  level  to  develop \ncooperative arrangements between the domestic agencies involved in regulating \nand  controlling  international  trade.  Where  possible,  international  cooperative \narrangements between neighboring countries will be sought. CBM training and \nawareness raising events will be organized for personnel working at BCPs.  \n ", "4  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000. And will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The TA will be part of the Trade \nFacilitation  Mechanism  initiated  by  the  Government  of  Japan  in  November  2010.5 The \ngovernments of CAREC countries will provide counterpart support in the form of the necessary \noffice space, counterpart staff, and other services to TA project consultants, and will assist in \narranging meetings with counterpart agencies. The cost estimates and financing table are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  Public  Management,  Financial  Sector,  and \nRegional Cooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will serve as the focal point and \nadminister the TA in coordination with the CAREC unit of the Central and West Asia Department, \nthe resident missions in CAREC countries concerned, and the CAREC Institute, which will \nprovide the TA training courses. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with the \nWCO and will contribute to implementation of the memorandum of understanding between ADB \nand WCO signed on 4 May 2010 during ADB\u2019s 43rd Annual Meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. In \naddition, the Customs and Tariff Bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Japan International \nCooperation Agency were consulted in terms of relevance and approach of the proposals. It \nwas decided that ADB will provide them with information about activities to be undertaken \nduring implementation and that the Customs and Tariff Bureau will participate in workshops and \nevents for experience sharing with CAREC. The 2-year implementation period will be from 1 \nFebruary 2014 to 31 January 2016. \n \n15.  The TA will require 30 person-months of intermittent international consulting services \nand 56 person-months of intermittent national consulting services. Consultants and resource \npersons will be specialists in the areas of customs reform, customs law, trade facilitation, and \nregional cooperation. In view of the TA project\u2019s diverse activities, consultants and resource \npersons will be selected on an individual basis. The consultants will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n16.  TA  progress  will  be  monitored  against  intended  outcomes,  outputs,  indicators,  and \ntargets  provided  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  Experience  and \nknowledge gained through the TA will be widely disseminated through knowledge products, \nsuch as strategic publications, policy and strategy papers, and conferences. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,250,000 on a grant \n                                                 \n5  In November 2010 the Government of Japan announced a new initiative called \u201cTrade Facilitation Mechanism\u201d to \ncontribute up to $25,000,000 to ADB for trade facilitation in Asia from 2011 to 2015.
