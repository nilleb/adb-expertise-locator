Under  the  program,  ADB  will  assume  a \nportion of the default risk arising under loans made by selected \npartner  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  to  microfinance  institutions \n(MFIs) in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). The risk \nassumed by ADB will be up to 50% of the participated MFI loans. \nHowever,  in  exceptional  cases,  a  higher  percentage  may  be \nconsidered subject to ADB investment committee approval.  \n \nThis  risk  participation  program  will  facilitate  the  expansion  of \nexisting  PFI  lending  volumes  to  MFIs.  The  program  will  be \navailable  for  5  years,  with  the  risk-participated  loans  to  MFIs \nhaving a maximum tenor of 3 years. The program could run up to \n8 years from the date of inception. \n   \nFinancial Intermediaries  International and local financial institutions supporting and funding \nmicrofinance in Asia.  \n   \nDevelopment Impact  The  proposed  ADB  investment  will  support  the  expansion  of \nlending to MFIs in ADB\u2019s DMCs, in turn providing an increase in \nthe  provision  of  financial  services  to  the  underserved  poor \npopulation segment. This will help address the significant unmet \ndemand for financial services, and provide additional funding for \nmicro-borrowers.  \n(i)  Impact. The transaction will lead to greater access to \nfinance for the underserved poor population segment, \ncontributing  to  increased  incomes  and  higher \nemployment, economic growth, and reduced poverty in \nADB\u2019s  DMCs.  The  transaction  will  also  promote \ndevelopment of the microfinance industry by widening \naccess to finance for borrowers and demonstrating the \nviability of microfinance.   \n(ii)  Outcome.  With  the  benefit  of  ADB\u2019s  unfunded  risk \nparticipation, PFIs will be able to expand their lending \n ", "ii \nvolumes to MFIs. By meeting unmet demand from MFIs \nfor funding, increased and sustainable access to finance \nwill be provided to poor households in ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n(iii)  Outputs.  ADB  will  implement  a  risk  participation \nprogram of up to $250 million that will enable PFIs to \nprovide  an  additional  $250  million  of  loans  to  MFI \ncustomers. \n   \nProposed ADB  Risk participation program of up to $250 million for loans made by \nAssistance  commercial financial institutions to microfinance institutions (MFIs) \nin ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n   \nRisks and Mitigating  Comprehensive due diligence conducted by ADB to evaluate the \nMeasures  viability of the proposed transaction determined the risks overall to \nbe acceptable for a transaction of this kind in the microfinance \nsector.  The  main  risks  identified  are  (i)  risks  associated  with \nlending  to  MFIs;  (ii)  PFI  performance  risk;  (iii)  geographical \nconcentration  of  the  reference  borrowers;  (iv)  credit  risks \nassociated with microfinance lending; and (v) foreign exchange \nrisks. \n \nIn a transaction of this nature, these risks are largely mitigated \nthrough selection of appropriate and responsible PFIs under the \nprogram, with sound experience, strong underwriting practices and \npolicies,  and  an  established  track  record  in  lending  to  MFIs. \nDetailed due diligence will be performed on each PFI before its \nentry  into  the  program,  to  ensure  that  it  has  the  capacity  and \ncapability to manage these risks.    \n   \nJustification / ADB  After 30 years of industry effort, a huge gulf remains between the \nValue Added  supply and demand for microfinance services. Commercial banks \nface restrictions on capital and counterparty lines that limit their \npossible  lending  volumes  to  MFIs.  The  proposed  program  will \nprovide  capital  relief  to  PFIs  in  their  MFI  lending  operations, \nmaking additional lending to MFIs possible. This, in turn, will allow \nMFIs to provide greater access to financial services for the poor in \nAsia. \n \nOverall, ADB\u2019s financial assistance is justified by the significant \ndevelopment impacts that increased funding to MFIs will bring to \nADB\u2019s DMCs, including the provision of financial services to the \nunderbanked population segment, and the resultant improvement \nin quality of lives and livelihoods of the general population. \n   \nImplementation  Monitoring. The terms of the risk participation agreements entered \nArrangements  into with PFIs will require PFIs to submit financial and other reports \nto  ADB  on  the  MFI  portfolio  of  loans  participated  under  the \nprogram on a routine basis.   \n \nEvaluation.  Monitoring  reports  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be \nsubmitted on an annual basis. ", "                         \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nMicrofinance Risk Participation Program of up to $250 million.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Economic and Sector Background \n2.  Emerging market financial institutions are growing at a rapid rate. However, this rate of \ngrowth is not sufficient to accommodate the demand for capital or the demand for banking \nproducts,  which  are  growing  at  far  greater  rates  throughout  developing  markets.  Asian \nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs)  that  are  able  to  attract  financing  commensurate  with  their \npotential size can grow their assets, product lines, operational efficiency, and management \ncapabilities to capitalize on the development that is taking place around them.   \n \n3.  Sustainable and large-scale microfinance can only be achieved if financial services for \nthe poor are integrated into overall financial systems. Microfinance has proven to be a critical \nelement of an effective poverty reduction strategy and the term itself refers to a range of \nfinancial  services  for  low-income  people,  including  credit,  savings,  insurance,  and  money \ntransfers. Microcredit plays an important role in helping the poor develop business opportunities \nand mitigate the unreliability of their income,1 and MFIs have increased in number and size \naround the world as they seek to meet the significant unmet demand for financial services from \nthe poor. The European Commission states that promoting microfinance is an important and \nsignificant  part  of  its  development  policy.2 World  leaders  also  affirmed  the  importance  of \nmicrofinance at the 2005 United Nations\u2019 General Assembly World Summit, where the Outcome \nDocument specifically referenced the need for access to financial services, in particular for the \npoor, including through microfinance and microcredit.3  \n \n4.  MFIs provide financial services (loans, savings accounts, insurance, etc.) to poor and \nunderserved or under-banked populations in developing economies. One of the most popular \nmicrofinance products has been \u201cmicrocredit,\u201d or loans in relatively small amounts. MFI loan \nsizes range from as little as $50 up to several thousand dollars or more. The microlending \nmodality  has  been  highly  successful  in  extending  finance  to  previously  economically \ndisenfranchised people.4   \n \n5.  While the argument for microfinance seems compelling, scientific testing of the impact of \nmicrofinance has proven extremely difficult. Studies in the area have provided mixed results, \nand the absence of control groups for comparison has led to significant debate about the validity \nof several studies.5 In addition, recent problems associated with borrower overindebtedness and \ncommercialization of microfinance have brought some organizations within the industry under \ncriticism. However, some studies continue to provide strong arguments advocating the benefits \n                                                 \n1  D. Collins, et al. 2009.

New York: United Nations (para. 23[i].  p. 6). \n4  Non-credit services provided by MFIs, such as savings accounts and insurance, also have powerful potential to \nhelp build social and economic security, by assisting low-income people to build assets and protect themselves \nagainst unforeseen crises.   \n5  R.

Evidence provided in a new study (footnote 1) demonstrates the importance of \nmicrofinance not only as a means to reduce poverty, but also as a means of improving the \nquality of daily life within the condition of poverty.6 The study presents the results of year-long \nfinancial diaries (maintained by the borrowers) collected twice a month from hundreds of rural \nand  urban  households  in  Bangladesh,  India,  and  South  Africa.  These  diaries  reveal  that \nfinancial instruments are critical survivor tools for poor households, and that these tools are \neven more important for the poor than more affluent people (footnote 5). More than three \ndecades of industry experience also demonstrates that microfinance customers not only take \nout loans, but repay them with high reliability, because of the borrowers\u2019 desire to retain access \nto a valued service. Clients value this service to the extent that they are willing to pay higher \ninterest on loans and accept minimal or no return on savings.  \n \n6.  Growth  of  the  microfinance  industry. There is no standardized system to which \nmicrofinance providers report and from which accurate information can be obtained,7 but data \ncollected by the Microcredit Summit Campaign8 reveals that 3,552 global microcredit institutions \nhad over 154 million clients by the end of 2007. More than 1,600 of these institutions were in \nAsia and the Pacific. However, the target population for microfinance services\u2014individuals living \non less than $2 per day and generally operating in the informal economy\u2014remains huge.9   \n \n7.  Asian microfinance institutions. The growth reported by MFIs in Asia and the Pacific \nover the past decade provides evidence of burgeoning demand in the microfinance industry. \nMuch of this growth has centered on the Indian and Bangladesh markets, with Bangladesh \ncurrently being home to the three largest dedicated MFIs in the world. The Association for \nSocial Advancement in Bangladesh had over 4 million active borrowers at the end of 2009, \ncompared  to  1.1  million  at  the  end  of  1999.  Bangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee \n(BRAC), also in Bangladesh, had more than 6.2 million active borrowers at the end of 2009, up \nfrom 2.6 million at the end of 1999. Rapid growth over the past decade in India has resulted in \nself-help groups now providing credit to over 10 million poor women. Using information gathered \nby the Microfinance Information eXchange (MIX), it can be observed in Figure 1 that growth in \nlending  by  Asian  MFIs  since  2000  has  been  substantial,  with  over  $10  billion  in  loans \noutstanding to more than 47 million borrowers by the end of 2008. \n \n                                                 \n6  K.

Asian  MFIs,  leveraging  high  staff  productivity  and  operating  in  densely  populated \nregions, dominate the global market in terms of scale and reach. Bangladesh, in particular, has \nmanaged to reach 35% of the country\u2019s poor, while MFIs in Sri Lanka and Viet Nam serve 25% \nof the poor in those countries.10 A number of Asian MFIs serve several million clients each.  \nMany  potential  microfinance  clients,  however,  continue  to  lack  access  to  basic  financial \nservices. In Cambodia and Indonesia, MFIs have reached only 10% of potential clientele, while \nin Afghanistan, India, and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the number is even smaller.11  \nUnderscoring this point is the fact that microfinance in Asia is a highly concentrated industry and \nin  2005  the  giants  (Bank  Rakyat  Indonesia  (BRI),  BRAC,  and  the  Association  for  Social \nAdvancement) accounted for more than 50% of the total number of borrowers from more than \n300 MFIs worldwide that report to MIX.12 A dramatic gap still exists in Asia between the demand \nand supply of microfinance products, pointing to a need for more and larger MFIs.   \n \n9.  Huge global financing gap in lending to microfinance institutions. Microfinance has \nevolved into a powerful tool to reduce poverty. As outlined above, while the growth of the \nmicrofinance  industry  has  been  substantial, after  three  decades  of  evolution,  many  of  the \nworking poor are still without access to microfinance services. At present growth rates, this gap \nwill not close for many decades. For microfinance to reach full potential in its ability to reduce \npoverty, the microfinance industry must grow to scale. \n                                                 \n10 There are a number of ways of measuring microfinance penetration; this statistic is specific to percentage of poor \npeople served, rather than the population overall. \n11 International Finance Corporation.

Current estimates of the total working poor in demand of microfinance services range \nfrom  600  million  to  over  1  billion  people.13 Figure  2  provides  one  relatively  conservative \nillustration of the extent of the disparity between the supply and demand of financing for the \npoor globally given these estimates. Practitioners also estimate that the total amount of funding \nrequired to meet the latent demand is $250 billion\u2013$300 billion.14 Despite these being global \nestimates, their relevance in considering the funding gap in the Asian region is clear given that \nAsia  and  the  Pacific  is  home  to  two-thirds  of  the  world\u2019s  poor.15 Furthermore,  various \ndemographic and economic conditions in developing countries\u2014such as population growth, \nlarge  proportions  of  youth,  limited  education  and  skills  training,  increased  rural  to  urban \nmigration, and insufficient ability of the formal sector to absorb new workers\u2014suggest that the \namount of potential microfinance clients will continue to grow.   \n \n11.  Restrictions on growth for microfinance institutions. The greatest inhibitor to growth \nof the microfinance industry is that the vast majority of MFIs lack the funding required to grow \nfurther. Although the industry has demonstrated that MFIs can be a self-sustaining business, \nmost still rely on donor funding, which is limited in supply. Without access to further capital \nsources, growth ceases once the grant money is onlent. MFIs must access large amounts of \nadditional capital to expand operations and initiate greater reach to poor borrowers. The only \nsource for these resources is the formal banking sector. \n \n12.  Banking market as source of funds for microfinance institutions. Formal financial \ninstitutions  are  therefore  increasingly  important  in  the  context  of  microfinance  given  their \ncapacity  to  leverage  their  capital  and  grow  their  operations.  For  several  mainstream \ninternational banks, such as Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and \nBNP Paribas, lending to microfinance institutions is one of many business lines. The entrance of \nthese institutions into microfinance provides not only a much needed source of funding for MFIs, \n                                                 \n13 Langer W. 2008.

These institutions also possess vast infrastructure and are in a good position to offer \nand  develop  further  benefits  from  synergies  between  microloans  and  other  services  they \nalready offer.16   \n \nB.  Investment Identification and Description \n13.  The microfinance industry faces several challenges. Among the most critical are (i) that \nMFIs have limited access to finance, particularly long-term funding; and (ii) that most of the \navailable funding is in foreign currency, exposing MFIs to foreign exchange risks that they are \nnot typically positioned to manage appropriately.  \n \n14.  International financial institutions (IFIs) as well as nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) \nprovide loans to Asian MFIs as part of their emerging markets lending business and to promote \nmicrofinance lending in the region. These institutions include leading Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  banks,  foundations,  trusts,  and  asset  managers, \nfocused  on  lending  to  MFIs.  These  institutions  actively  pursue  business  opportunities  that \noverlap  with  development  financial  institution  (DFI)  mandates  in  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) lending, microfinance, and environmental finance. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has approached several such potential partner financial institutions (PFIs), and \nrequested that they consider cooperation on a purely Asian MFI portfolio through a risk-sharing \narrangement that would enable these institutions to lend greater volumes into the microfinance \nsector. This would allow ADB to be a key player in partnership with these financial institutions in \nthe microfinance sector in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs), while making use of \nthe institution\u2019s origination and loan processing capabilities.    \n \n15.  All participating banks will be approved by ADB\u2019s investment committee. In addition to \ninternational commercial banks active in financing MFIs in Asia, the program will target domestic \nfinancial institutions in ADB\u2019s DMCs that are engaged in wholesale MFI funding. The program \nwill be marketed in the respective DMCs accordingly. Under the program, ADB will acquire, on \nan unfunded basis, participations in loans made to MFIs by PFIs. Such risk participation will \nfacilitate expansion of existing lending volumes to MFIs by these PFIs. Under the program, ADB \nwill acquire participations of up to 50% of the default risk of loans made by the PFI to MFI \ncustomers in ADB\u2019s DMCs. In exceptional cases, a higher percentage may be considered \nsubject to ADB investment committee\u2019s approval.  \n \n16.  Key features of the proposed program would include (i) a risk participation agreement \nthat would cover term facilities of up to 3 years; and (ii) risk coverage for PFI loans that are \nmostly denominated in local currency (and sourced through the PFIs\u2019 branch network). By \nentering into a risk participation agreement with ADB, a PFI will continue to make loans in local \ncurrency while being able to double its allowable lending volumes to MFIs. This risk participation \nagreement will not only provide the PFIs with ADB\u2019s backing and support, but will also catalyze \nincremental lending to MFIs operating in ADB\u2019s DMCs. Furthermore, ADB has several years of \nexperience  with  this  type  of  facility,  including  SME  risk  participation  in  Pakistan  and  the \nPhilippines, as well as the Trade Finance Program (TFP), under which ADB provides risk \ncoverage to international banks to support international trade transactions. However, this will be \nthe first time that ADB will be rolling out a risk participation program of this scale targeted \nspecifically for private sector MFIs. \n \n                                                 \n16 E.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n17.  Financial sector development is listed as one of five core specializations for operational \nfocus under Strategy 202017 that best supports ADB\u2019s agenda, reflects DMCs\u2019 needs and ADB\u2019s \ncomparative  strengths,  and  complements  efforts  by  development  partners.  Under  Strategy \n2020, ADB will strengthen its support to the finance sector at the regional and national levels by \nhelping to develop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services. To promote \ninclusive  growth,  ADB  will  seek  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  microfinance,  rural \nfinancial institutions, and SMEs, and will explore the use of technologies to expand the reach of \nthe formal financial system to rural areas. The proposed transaction supports institutional and \nfinancial sector development, particularly in the area of microfinance, and directly supports \nADB\u2019s strategy of expanding the reach of the formal financial system to rural and underserved \nareas. \n \n18.  The proposed project also supports the operational and institutional goal under Strategy \n2020 to scale up private sector development and private sector operations in all operational \nareas, to reach 50% of annual operations by 2020.  \n \n2.  Consistency with the Sector Strategy \n19.  Supporting financial sector development is a key focus of developmental assistance for \nADB, in line with the tenets detailed in ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy18 and \nenhanced poverty reduction strategy,19 which note improved economic growth, stimulated by \nprivate sector investment, as a key contributing factor in reducing poverty. ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nDevelopment Strategy refers specifically to ADB\u2019s role in strengthening the financial sector in \nDMCs. The strategy notes the critical importance of well functioning financial systems for the \ndevelopment of the private sector, which in turn underpins sustainable economic growth. Many \nDMCs need to strengthen their financial institutions and create diversified financial markets that \ncan finance private sector-led growth.  \n    \n20.  The proposed program is consistent with the overall sector strategy in that it will help in \nthe development of the microfinance sector and increase access to financial services for the \npoor\u2014making  private  sector  development  more  sustainable  and  ADB\u2019s  mission  of  poverty \nreduction  more  achievable.  The  proposed  intervention  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  recently \ndeveloped business plan for private sector capital markets initiatives, under which microfinance \nhas been elevated to a core focus area. The proposed project is also viewed as complementary \nto a proposed equity investment in ShoreCap II Limited, which is currently being processed. \nThrough this fund, ADB seeks to promote development by providing financial support to MFIs \n(and small business banks). \n \n21.  Finally, the proposed project is consistent with ADB\u2019s overarching poverty reduction \nstrategy, which states that ADB seeks to promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems and \ncapital markets,\u201d since these are seen as \u201cindispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2008.

Lessons Learned from Previous Operations \n22.  In  2007,  the  Board  approved  a  $20  million  Micro-  and  Small  Enterprise  Financing \nFacility. 20  The  program  was  designed  to  provide  medium-term  funding  to  microfinance \ninstitutions in ADB\u2019s DMCs. Although the program was considered appropriate in terms of \nmarket need, there were several  challenges in implementation and the program remained \nalmost 85% unutilized. Only one loan was disbursed, to INECO Bank in Armenia. The limited \nsuccess of the program was due to the length of time taken to agree terms and document the \npotential loans under the program, the lack of availability of ADB human resources to invest \nsignificant time on several small individual loans, and the growing need for local currency \nfunding as opposed to foreign currency loans. A programmatic approach as contemplated under \nthis program, can address these concerns by utilizing the resources and comparative advantage \nof a third party institution that has access to local currency and a strong presence on the ground \nin ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n \n4.  Consistency with Other Relevant ADB Operations \n23.  ADB  has  supported  financial  sector  reform  programs  both  through  public  sector \noperations  and/or  direct  private  sector  investments  in  strategically  selected  financial \nintermediaries in several DMCs. The proposition is to leverage the significant work already \nundertaken by ADB\u2019s regional departments in this sector, and will involve close collaboration \nwith them in (i) establishing regional teams to identify priority countries; (ii) capitalizing on ADB\u2019s \nrelationships with key government bodies, including central banks and finance ministries; and \n(iii) identifying key participants (PFIs and MFIs) in respective countries, and introducing them to \nthis program and its related benefits.  \n \n24.  ADB has supported microfinance and micro and small enterprise (MSE) initiatives for \nalmost  two  decades.  Since  1988,  ADB  has  approved  32  microfinance  specific  projects \n(aggregating to $1.9 billion in financing) and 66 TA projects. In 2000, recognizing that the \nindustry landscape had changed, ADB formulated and approved the Microfinance Development \nStrategy (MDS), which provides a consistent and comprehensive framework and guides ADB\u2019s \nmicrofinance operations.21  \n \n25.  The MDS  aims to ensure permanent access to institutional financial services for a \nmajority of poor and low-income households and their microenterprises. The purpose is to \nsupport the development of sustainable microfinance systems that can provide diverse, high-\nquality  services.  The  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  creating  a  policy  environment  conducive  to \nmicrofinance,  (ii)  developing  financial  infrastructure,  (iii)  building  viable  institutions,  (iv) \nsupporting pro-poor innovations, and (v) supporting social intermediation. The MDS states that \nADB  will  catalyze  expanding  the  supply  of  microfinance  by  focusing  on  building  financial \nsystems that can grow and provide financial services on a permanent basis to an increasing \nproportion of the poor. The MDS encourages ADB to, among other things, support development \nof viable institutions that can set in motion a process of commercialization of microfinance \nservices.22 \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2007.

ADB\u2019s mission is poverty reduction in its DMCs, and each intervention that the \nbank undertakes should relate\u2014either directly or indirectly, and immediately or over the long-\nterm\u2014to achievement of that mission. In this transaction, ADB\u2019s sharing of risk with PFIs \nengaged in lending to MFIs is ultimately intended, over the long term, to help increase economic \ncontribution by microfinance clients and small businesses to growth in the region, as well as to \nincrease access of the poor to finance. This set of linkages is detailed in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). Furthermore, as many MFIs focus on lending to women as \na group, or provide credit to microenterprises run by women, this program intends to track this \ndata across the MFIs that will be part of this program. MIX, a growing source for financial and \nsocial performance data that a large number of Asian MFIs report to, tracks information specific \nto women. As the program will cover several countries, PFIs, and MFIs, it is not possible to \nforecast the overall impact on women accurately. However, it is possible to monitor the impact \non women through MIX and the intention is to report this data on a regular basis.      \n \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n27.  The proposed intervention by ADB will allow PFIs to increase their volumes of lending in \nthe microfinance sector and remain in compliance with imposed lending limits, thereby granting \naccess to credit for MFIs and their borrowers. Loans provided by MFIs are frequently used to \nexpand the operations of micro- and small businesses, translating directly into job creation, \noften for those at the lower end of the income spectrum. The combination of additional micro-\nentrepreneurs and small businesses doing incremental business and employing additional staff \nwill contribute to rising incomes, higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and ultimately a \nlower incidence of poverty. The financing will also assist micro businesses to expand and at \nsome point enter the formal economy, thus beginning to pay taxes that DMC governments can \ndirect toward much needed social services and infrastructure requirements. \n \n28.  MSE development directly strengthens the economic activities of poor households, while \nhelping them build diverse assets and cope with emergencies and other risks. In developing \ncountries,  microenterprises  are  the  main  source  of  jobs  for  poor  people\u2014microenterprises \nconsist of 80% of total enterprises, 50% of urban enterprises, and 20% of gross national product \nfor developing countries worldwide.23 Development of the MSE sector therefore yields powerful \nreturns to the economy as a whole. A critical aspect of this strategy is developing sustainable \nfinancial services that support MSEs and meet low-income families\u2019 needs for credit.24 \n \n29.  Broadening access to financial markets for microfinance institutions and their \ncustomers. Modern microfinance has evolved over the past 30 years to become an industry of \nsignificant scale. However, a more commercial industry must be built to reduce the still immense \ngap between the demand and supply of sustainable financial services to the poor through \nsustainable  and  innovative  approaches.  Creating  an  enabling  environment  for  sustainable \nmicrofinance and building strong retail capacity remain the most critical needs in many countries \nin the Asian region.25  \n                                                 \n23 ResponsAbility Global Microfinance Fund. 2005.

The amount of financing MFIs can obtain is limited (by factors such as size of balance \nsheet, lack of capital, inability to raise deposits, etc.) by the amount of counterparty lines its \ncommercial lenders can provide. Since loans to MFIs tend to be small compared to more \nmainstream banks and corporate entities, and since the origination of loans to MFIs typically \ntakes place in emerging markets that require specialized credit skills on the part of the lending \nbanks, origination of loans to MFIs is comparatively expensive and the number of originating \nbanks is limited. Through ADB\u2019s proposed risk participation arrangement, commercial financing \ninstitutions that are developing microfinance operations will be able to achieve greater scale \nwithout overextending their risk exposure, thereby creating additional financing opportunities for \nMFIs which leads to greater access to finance for micro-borrowers.  \n \n31.  Greater financial inclusion. The provision or expansion of financial services to poor or \ndisadvantaged people previously unable to gain access is known as \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d and is \nincreasingly being seen as important to poverty reduction and achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).26 Through borrowing and saving, the poor can plan for their future \nbeyond  the  short  term.  They  can  accumulate  assets  and  invest  in  productive  enterprises, \neducation, and health. Financial services can help them cope in times of hardship. Beyond the \ntangible  aspects,  access  to  financial  services  promotes  social  inclusion,  and  builds  self-\nconfidence and empowerment, particularly for women. In Bangladesh, according to MIX27, 274 \nMFIs have over 25 million borrowers, covering 17% of the total population and 35% of the poor \npopulation.  Approximately 90% of these MFI clients are women and 89% of them reside in rural \nareas. Similarly, in Pakistan28, the outreach effort of the microfinance sector has resulted in 2 \nmillion active borrowers, out of which nearly 50% are women. Comparable outreach to women \ncan also be seen in several other countries, including India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.29 \n \n32.  Limited access to financial services can be a major constraint to the participation and \ncontribution of the poor to economic growth. A recent report from the World Bank studying \nSouth Asia, shows that countries in this region lag far behind international benchmarks with \nrespect to key indicators for financial access. A large portion of the population, most notably the \nlow income population, does not have adequate access to formal financial services (based on \npeople per branch, number of ATMs, and number of loan and deposit accounts). Over 58% of \nthe adult population (or 612 million people) in South Asia fall in this category (footnote 29). \nGreater  levels  of  financial  inclusion  can  significantly  improve  the  welfare  of  low-income \nhouseholds by helping them meet basic needs, protecting against risks and economic shocks.    \n      \n2.  Private Sector Development \n33.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  intervention  will  make  a  direct  contribution  to  private  sector \ndevelopment by encouraging and promoting such mechanisms as (i) enhanced disclosure and \nreporting standards; (ii) enhanced data gathering and collation, particularly with respect to credit \ninformation; (iii) increasing the volume of funding being provided to private sector institutions \nengaged  in  microfinance  lending;  and  (iv)  an  increased  share  of  nonsovereign  financial \ninstitution assets in the total assets of the financial sectors of DMCs. The proposed transaction \nwill in this manner help DMCs meet their objectives with respect to their private sector and \nfinancial sector development strategies.  \n                                                 \n26 Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID). 2010.

Increasing the level of financial resources that \nPFIs can allocate to microfinance will help the PFIs to develop robust and market leading MFI \nlending  operations,  thereby  strengthening  and  extending  the  reach  of  the  commercial \nmicrofinance sector as a whole. Through successful development and expansion of operations \nin this market segment, PFIs will signal to other potential commercial lenders that lending to \nMFIs can be done in a sustainable and profitable manner. This will encourage other financial \ninstitutions to engage in MFI lending directly. As more institutions enhance operations in the \nsector, it will help stimulate greater competition in the microfinance wholesale lending business, \nleading to increased efficiency and provision of financing at more competitive pricing over time.  \n \n3.  Outputs and Outcome \n    a.  Outcome \n \n35.  With the assistance of a risk participation agreement between ADB and PFIs, such PFIs \nwill be able to expand their lending volumes to MFIs. Through meeting unmet demand from \nMFIs for funding, increased and sustainable access to finance will ultimately be provided to poor \nhouseholds in ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n \n    b.  Output \n \n36.  ADB will implement a $250 million risk participation program that will enable PFIs to \nprovide an additional $250 million of funding to MFI customers. Given that the risk participation \nprogram will be available for a period of 5 years, the expected turnover under this could be in \nexcess of $600 million. \n \nIII.  PARTNER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  \n37.  ADB will work with select partner financial institutions (PFI) under the proposed risk \nparticipation  program.  Targeted  PFIs  will  include  both  international  and  domestic  financial \ninstitutions that engage in MFI wholesale lending as a core business. Each PFI selected under \nthe program will have experience in MFI lending, and be a market leader in the microfinance \nlending segment. PFIs must also have an expressed willingness to broaden their Asian MFI \ncustomer base. Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) is an example of such an institution and ADB \nis in discussions with them in relation to this program. Each PFI will undergo detailed due \ndiligence by ADB. Each PFI under the program will be approved by ADB\u2019s Management.  At a \nminimum, each PFI will be required to meet the standards listed in Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                          11\n \n \nTable 1: Partnership Financial Institution Criteria for  \nMicrofinance Risk Participation Program \n \nCredit Standards  MFI Lending Experience \nCredit rating of BB or higher (or equivalent) from at least  At least 3 years of lending to MFIs in ADB DMCs \none international credit rating agency and/or recognized by \nindustry as a key player in microfinance sector (CGAP, IFC, \nand other MDBs) \nReputable and sound ownership, management, and  Acceptable underwriting and servicing platforms in \ngovernance standards (including composition of the board  place \nof directors) \nDedicated approach to the sector  Dedicated MFI teams at both relationship manager as \nwell as risk management levels \nPasses detailed ADB due diligence and ADB investment  Well performing MFI portfolio with NPLs of less than \ncommittee approval  5% \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CGAP = Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, DMC = developing member \ncountry, IFC = International Finance Corporation, MDB = multilateral development bank, MFI = microfinance \ninstitution, NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSource: ADB. \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n38.  The proposed project is a risk participation program of up to $250 million for loans made \nto MFIs. The objective of the program is to cover payment default risk on loans made by PFIs to \nMFIs in ADB DMCs. The risk participation agreement entered into with respective PFIs is \nexpected to cover up to 50% of the default risk of the MFIs covered under the program. In \nexceptional  cases,  a  higher  percentage  may  be  considered  subject  to  ADB  investment \ncommittee approval. The program will be available for 5 years, with participated loans to MFIs \nhaving a maximum tenor of 3 years. Accordingly, the program could run up to 8 years from the \ndate of inception. In some cases, particularly in emerging developing economies, ADB may \nassume a higher portion of the risk, to encourage PFIs to lend where there is a significant lack \nof access to finance for MFIs. Under the risk sharing arrangement, ADB would create additional \nheadroom for PFIs to increase lending volumes under PFI country and individual MFI limits. \nFigure 3 details how the risk participation arrangements will operate. \n \n ", "12    \n \n \n39.  ADB will acquire risk participations from PFIs, with the following features and conditions: \n \n(i)  ADB will consider each PFI\u2019s recommendations on MFIs that it intends to place \nunder this program. At a minimum, the PFIs will confirm to ADB that the MFI \nmeets all of the PFI\u2019s credit and underwriting requirements, as well as social and \nenvironmental  standards.  ADB  will  not  conduct  detailed  independent  due \ndiligence and evaluations on these MFIs, but rather an abbreviated desktop \nreview  to  determine  whether  to  accept  the  MFI  into  the  program.  ADB  will \nprimarily rely on the PFI\u2019s credit process, its extensive industry experience, and \nits relationships with the MFIs.  \n(ii)  Under a risk participation agreement, ADB will typically assume 50% of the risk \nof MFI payment default. \n(iii)  The risk participation agreement will provide ADB cover in US dollars, even \nthough underlying MFI loans are usually in local currency.   \n(iv)  ADB will participate in existing loans outstanding to MFIs, as well as new loans.  \nThis will enable the PFI to increase its lending limit to existing relationships that it \nhas experience with, and allow loans to additional MFIs that meet its lending \ncriteria. Conversely, it will provide ADB with the comfort of dealing with a mature \nportfolio  and  over  a  period  of  time,  give  ADB  the  reassurance  of  possibly \nexpanding the facility to cover smaller and slightly riskier MFIs. \n(v)  No watchlisted and/or classified accounts will be eligible. \n(vi)  ADB will also require periodic reports from the PFI to update progress on loans \nparticipated  under  the  program,  particularly  with  respect  to  utilization  and \nmeeting portfolio growth targets. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n40.  Microfinance, since its inception in 1970s, has evolved into a powerful tool to reduce \npoverty. Based on the belief that the poor have the capacity to transform their lives, once given \nthe opportunity, MFIs have been able to reach over 100 million of the world\u2019s poor by the end of \n2007\u2014touching the lives of an estimated half a billion family members (footnote 9). \n \n41.  However, even after 30 years of industry effort, a huge gulf remains between the supply \nand demand for microfinance services. According to the European Commission, as many as 3 \nbillion people still lack access to formal financial services and at current growth rates, the gap ", "                          13\nwill not be closed for decades. For microfinance to achieve its potential as a global poverty \nreduction tool, the microfinance industry must grow to scale.30  \n \n42.  Commercial banks face restrictions on capital and counterparty lines that limit their \npossible lending volumes to MFIs. The proposed facility complements ADB\u2019s existing direct-\nlending  activities  to  the  MFI  industry  through  financial  intermediation  by  making  possible \nadditional lending by PFIs to MFIs. This, in turn, will deepen access by MFIs to financing, and \nsupport their lending activities, thus broadening access to these MFIs by the poor in Asia. The \neffects therefore include both a broadening and deepening of MFI lending. Given the reluctance \nof many lending financial institutions to provide long-term funding to MFIs because of perceived \nrisks associated with microfinance broadly, through the proposed intervention, ADB will help \nincrease the capacity of commercial banks in the area of MFI lending. This will have the \nimportant multiplier effect of encouraging other commercial lenders to provide financing to \ninstitutions that are engaged in, or considering becoming engaged in, providing funding to MFIs.    \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n43.  Microfinance  has  proven  to  be  a  critical  element  of  an  effective  poverty  reduction \nstrategy and the term \u201cmicrofinance\u201d refers to a range of financial services for low-income \npeople, including credit, savings, insurance, and money transfers. MFIs could comprise licensed \nand unlicensed financial institutions that include NGOs, commercial banks, credit unions and \ncooperatives, and agricultural and postal saving banks. Given this, the credit risk that ADB will \nundertake will be on (i) the underlying MFIs; (ii) the PFIs\u2019 ability to select strong and sustainable \nMFIs;  (iii)  the  PFIs\u2019  internal  credit  and  risk  management  processes;  (iv)  the  quality  of \nmanagement information systems (MIS); and (v) the management team. ADB\u2019s due diligence \nprocess will cover all of these areas for each PFI considered under the program.  \n \n44.  In addition to the inherent risks associated with emerging markets investments and in \nparticular to the microfinance sector, risks embedded in the transaction, and potential mitigants, \nwill include those listed below.      \n \n45.  Risks  related  to  MFIs. There are risks associated with the creditworthiness of the \nunderlying MFIs. These include the level of demand for microfinance borrowing, liquidity and \nfinancial sustainability, and operational and governance risks. Credit risk at the MFI level can \nalso be influenced by overindebtedness among microfinance borrowers, given the lack of credit \ndata available in the microfinance sector and the absence of credit bureaus in many countries. \nThere also tends to be inconsistencies in the method of financial reporting by MFIs. ADB will \nutilize internal ratings performed by PFIs that are mapped to the default frequency and external \nrating scale of international rating agencies where available to assist in comparing MFI standing \nand performance. However, in certain instances where PFIs do not have an internal rating \nscale, a more rigorous approach will be followed in assessing the credit risk of individual MFIs. \nSome MFIs have also experienced difficulties in managing growth and expanding into new \nproduct lines, which will be carefully assessed during the credit review process.  \n \n46.  The risks associated with individual MFIs and their operations are best managed through \nin-depth knowledge of the institution and the environment in which the MFI operates. Through \ntheir regional network, personnel on the ground, and close borrower contact, PFIs are best \npositioned to assess and manage this risk. ADB will therefore rely to a large extent on the PFIs\u2019 \nexperience in their markets, and the PFIs\u2019 rigorous underwriting and monitoring standards to \n                                                 \n30 Unitus.  Why  the  Poor  Still  Lack  Access.  http://www.unitus.com/unitus-in-action/background-poverty-and-\nmicrofinance/why-the-poor-still-lack-access \n ", "14    \nmitigate risks related to the individual MFIs. ADB\u2019s due diligence of the PFIs\u2019 internal standards \nand  systems  therefore  forms  a  critical  component  of  ensuring  MFI  risks  are  managed \nappropriately.     \n \n47.  Partner financial institution performance risk. As stated, ADB will substantially rely \non the operational and business judgment of PFIs given their industry experience and expertise. \nThe PFI remains the loan originator and servicer, so adequate credit quality of the PFI is \nimportant for continued maintenance of the facility. Financial difficulties with the PFI could impair \nits  ability  to  process  and  manage  the  MFI  loan  portfolio.  The  ability  of  PFIs  to  maintain \nacceptable ongoing performance levels may therefore be impacted by such issues as changes \nin risk appetite, staffing and recruitment, maintenance of credit underwriting and monitoring \nprocedures, and market forces. With these concerns, ADB will endeavor to select PFIs with \nsound MFI assessment and monitoring systems, a solid track record of building an MFI portfolio \nand one that has an acceptable credit profile as determined by the selection criteria for PFIs \n(Table 1). Further, through equal sharing of risk between ADB and the PFI in most cases, the \nPFI will be sufficiently incentivized to maintain high loan origination and monitoring standards. \n    \n48.  Regulatory and reputation risk. The MFI industry in many DMCs may not yet operate \nwithin  a  robust  regulatory  framework,  and  MFIs  may  therefore  be  susceptible  to  political \ninterference. MFIs have also been criticized for charging high interest rates, leading to calls in \nsome countries for interest rate caps and requests for debt forgiveness to distressed borrowers. \nPoliticians have also questioned the practices and collection methods of certain MFIs. There is \npotential reputation risk for ADB if the MFIs selected under the program are engaged in illegal \nand unethical lending practices. In consultation with PFIs, ADB will assess the suitability of each \nMFI client, and take into account the local regulatory and political environment in ADB\u2019s review \nprocess. Furthermore, to ensure that the portfolio meets the above standards, ADB will conduct \nstringent  due  diligence  on  PFIs  to  ensure  that  each  PFI  has  an  appropriate  screening \nmechanism for MFIs.  The due diligence will, amongst other areas, evaluate that in selecting the \nMFI,  the  PFI  has  ensured  that  the  underlying  MFIs  are  legitimate  and    indisputable,  are \nrespected and well reputed and have an outreach and social agenda that they are able to report \non and monitor. \n \n49.  Geographical  concentration  of  the  reference  entities.  The  MFIs  conduct  their \nbusiness in limited countries throughout Asia. The geographical concentration of the MFIs may \ntherefore result in a greater risk of loss than if such concentration had not been present. This \nrisk can be managed through analysis of the reference MFI portfolios when new PFIs are \nconsidered  under  the  program,  and  through  reaching  agreement  with  PFIs  on  new  target \ncountries and new MFIs for participation under the program. Eligibility criteria can also be built \ninto  terms  agreed  with  PFIs  to  ensure  underlying  exposure  does  not  become  overly \nconcentrated in particular geographic locations, or to specific MFIs being funded by more than \none PFI. Furthermore, geographic concentration risk will be safeguarded by internal reviews of \nexposure limits for MFIs in each country. \n \n50.  Credit risks of micro-loans. All of the loans covered under the program will be to MFIs \nthat extend credit to micro-entrepreneurs and microenterprises in developing countries. Most of \nthese micro-borrowers have low incomes and little or no previous credit history. History has \nshown that risks associated with microloans can be managed through features such as group \nlending  models  and  taking  certain  types  of  collateral.  MFIs  have  also  started  to  lend  to \nmicroenterprises based on enterprise cash flows. Therefore, selection of MFIs with an ability to \nassess  these  risks  is  important  for  PFIs.  The  PFIs\u2019  own  standards  for  underwriting  and \nmanaging their MFI lending portfolio are therefore critical to ADB in the context of the program.   ", "                          15\n \n51.  Foreign  exchange  rate  risk.  The  underlying  MFI  loans  will,  in  most  cases,  be \ndenominated in local currency, while the guarantee is denominated in US dollars. Foreign \nexchange rates will be set at the transaction closing date when loans are first included in the \nreference portfolio. PFIs will ensure that single borrower and overall country limits are not \nbreached when setting these rates. Furthermore, in the event of default, ADB will be liable to \npay at the prevailing rate. In a scenario where the local currency has appreciated against the \nUS dollar, ADB\u2019s liability under the program could be greater for that specific MFI borrower than \nwhat had earlier been anticipated and/or approved. However, at no time will ADB\u2019s exposure to \nrisk covered under agreement with a PFI be greater than the pre-determined limit agreed with \nthat PFI. To ensure that ADB does not exceed its single borrower or country limits, ADB will \nrequire PFIs to submit regular reports on exposure covered by ADB. \n \n52.  Capacity risk. Under the programmatic approach of the proposed transaction, ADB will \nplace some level of reliance on PFIs to underwrite and monitor the MFI loans, and will therefore \nbenefit from a resource perspective through effective outsourcing of these functions. However, \nin addition to performing detailed due diligence on each PFI to determine their suitability for the \nprogram, ADB will also still be required to undertake a review of each underlying MFI and MFI \nloan  in  order  to  ensure  maintenance  of  appropriate  risk  levels  commensurate  with  ADB \nstandards. This will have potential resource implications for ADB that will need to be managed \nin the context of expansion of the program.    \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n53.  The proposed project will be classified as financial intermediary and will be treated as \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).  Given the nature of microfinance operations, environmental \nimpacts are expected to be negligible and no involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous \npeoples are foreseen. ADB will determine the level of oversight required to verify compliance \nduring the due diligence exercise conducted on each PFI and its MFI lending operations. The \nfirst  potential  PFI,  SCB,  was  viewed  as  having  robust  internal  environmental  and  social \nscreening practices, through the use of its environmental and social risk assessment tool. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n54.  Monitoring.  In keeping with the arrangements for ADB\u2019s private sector guarantees, \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division will be responsible for the \nmonitoring of this investment. All participating PFIs will provide ADB with financial reports at pre-\ndetermined regular intervals and as requested. ADB will review these reports on an ongoing \nbasis and monitor the value of its exposure accordingly.    \n \n55.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB on a regular \nbasis, but at least annually. The first such report will be submitted no later than 12 months after \napproval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.   \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy  \n56.  All PFIs will be advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \nthe Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the \n ", "16    \nPFIs to have instituted, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the PFIs will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nD.  Investment Limitations \n57.  The  proposed  program  will  be  within  the  approved  medium-term,  country,  industry, \ngroup, and single project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nE.  Assurances \n58.  No-objection  letter.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank,  the  government  of  each  country  in  which  MFIs  borrowing  under  the \nprogram are located will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance.  No participation under the program in such country will be made effective until ADB \nreceives such confirmation.   \n \n59.  Documentation. ADB will enter into suitable risk participation agreements and other \nrequired legal documents once the proposed program is approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \nand the individual PFIs are approved by the ADB investment committee. These agreements will \nbe on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n60.  I am satisfied that the proposed risk participation program would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \nthe Microfinance Risk Participation Program of up to $250,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n22 November 2010 ", "  Appendix 2  17\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nSummary  and Indicators with  Reporting  and Risks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpacts      Assumptions \n        \nIncreased economic  Employment and  Central banks\u2019  Increased access to \ncontribution to the  productive output in the  statistics, market  finance will lead to more \nAsia and Pacific  MSE sectors of target  data, and MFI data  MSEs receiving loans and \nregion by micro- DMCs increase by a total  compiled by  expanding their role in the \nborrowers  of 10% over the next 5  industry-specific  economy \n  years (2011\u20132015)   organizations such   \n    as Microfinance   \nGreater financial  Number of registered  Information  Stable or increased \naccess for  microfinance customers at  eXchange   economic development in \nunderserved poor  MFIs supported under the    Asia  \ncustomers  program increases by   \n  25% from 2011 to 2015   Supportive regulatory \n    environment \n     \n    Risk \n     \nExpansion of private  Private investment in the  The global financial crisis \ncapital flows in the  microfinance sector in  has a prolonged negative \nAsian microfinance  Asia increases by 20%  effect on broader economic \nsector  from 2011 to 2015  growth \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nExpanded and  MFIs funded under the  MFI annual reports  There is demand for credit \nimproved access to  program increase their  and financial  services \nfinance for MFIs in  balance sheet funding  statements   \nADB DMCs  and loan portfolios by    MFIs do not breach \n30% from 2011 to 2015    respective national \n    prudential norms \nPortfolio credit quality  Reports requested   \nremains high among MFIs  from PFIs  No regulatory changes for \nsupported under the  the microfinance sector in \n \nprogram, with average  relevant countries \nNPLs of less than 5%     \nNo further adverse regional \n   \nor national economic \n  developments  \n \nNo other exogenous factors \nthat have a negative impact \non Asian financial sector \ndevelopment \n \nRisk \nStability of the regional \neconomic and political \nlandscape \n \n ", "18   Appendix 1 \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nSummary  and Indicators with  Reporting  and Risks \nBaselines Mechanisms\nOutput      Assumptions \n       \nRisk participation  $250 million is made  Reports requested  Identification of a sufficient \nprogram is  available for Asian  from PFIs  number of PFIs to fully \nimplemented  microfinance customers  utilize the program  \nup to 2015  \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.1 Continue to engage potential PFIs and promote  ADB: $250 million in microfinance credit exposure \nutilization of the risk participation program   through risk participation \n1.2 Conduct due diligence on PFIs, including   \nreview of microfinance portfolio, business plan, \ncredit underwriting, and monitoring procedures \n1.3 Agree on MFI eligibility criteria with PFIs  \n1.4 Execute appropriate documentation with PFIs \nunder risk participation agreements \n \n2.1 PFIs will continue to lend in the Asian \nmicrofinance sector and report to ADB at agreed \nregular intervals \n2.2 Monitor and manage the underlying risk \nexposure on an ongoing basis  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMC = developing member country, MFI = microfinance institution, MSE = micro \nand small enterprise, NPL = nonperforming loan, PFI = partner financial institution. \nSource: ADB.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  19\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry and Project Title:  Proposed Microfinance Risk Participation Program \n \nPrivate Sector Operations \nLending/Financing  Department/  Department \nRisk participation \nModality:  Division:  Capital Markets and \nFinancial Sectors Division \n     \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the Poverty Reduction Strategy \nThis project is a regional initiative so it does not link to a specific Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing \nmember country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy or country partnership strategy. However, the initiative is aligned with \nADB\u2019s central mission of poverty reduction through the implementation of various ADB strategies in relation to (i) \npromotion of microfinancing and increased access to finance, (ii) enhancement of financial markets, and (iii) \nencouragement of appropriate private sector-led initiatives in addressing these goals. This project would directly \naddress all these key elements of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategya\u2014the promotion of (i) pro-poor, sustainable \neconomic growth (through financial assistance to microenterprises provided by microfinance institutions [MFIs]); (ii) \nsocial development (by enabling financial institutions via MFIs to reach out to poor, underserved areas of their \neconomies, as well as embrace socially sound practices); and (iii) good governance (through working with and \nendorsing responsible participating financial institutions (PFIs) that are active in microfinance and lending to MFIs). \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                Targeting Classification: General intervention \nKey issues. Sharing risk with PFIs will enable these PFIs to increase their lending volumes to MFIs, which will in \nturn lead to increased financing for the poor and underbanked populations in Asian developing markets. The \nborrowers are typically microenterprises that use the funds to establish or expand small-scale businesses, or \nindividuals seeking to satisfy domestic needs. MFIs also provide non-credit services such as savings accounts and \ninsurance that offer equal or greater potential to help build social and economic security, by assisting low-income \npeople to build assets and protect themselves against unforeseen crises. The microlending modality has been very \nsuccessful in extending finance to previously economically disenfranchised people.   \nDesign features. This project will support the goal of poverty reduction indirectly through stimulating economic \ngrowth, and directly by helping to improve access to finance for some of Asia\u2019s poorest households. This will create \nemployment opportunities, provide more investment in human capital, and otherwise benefit low-income people \nthrough providing financial access.   \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey issues. This project is classified as category FI under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will share \nrisk with PFIs to increase PFI funding provided to MFIs, which will in turn finance individuals and microenterprises. \nThese microenterprises will not acquire land through expropriation or restrict access to land or cause physical or \neconomic  displacement.  Underlying  MFIs  may  extend  credit  and  non-credit  services  in  localities  with  ethnic \nminorities or indigenous peoples. Through these MFIs, PFIs may benefit individual businesses owned by indigenous \npeoples or ethnic minorities in rural areas but will not affect indigenous peoples as a community or their dignity, \nhuman rights, livelihood systems, or culture. Activities of these microenterprises are unlikely to use ancestral land or \nany ancestral domain and will not involve any large-scale development of products of indigenous knowledge. ADB \nwill ensure that PFIs have established social and environmental management practices (including an environment \nand  social  management  system)  that  are  compliant  with  ADB  policies,  including  reporting  requirements  and \nadherence to ADB\u2019s exclusion list.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations will be held with all PFIs under the program, as has been done with Standard Chartered Bank (SCB).   \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nRequirements regarding project implementation and monitoring will be included in transaction documentation. \n ", "20    Appendix 2 \n \nC.   Gender and Development \nKey issues. The program intends to track data across the MFIs that will be part of it. The Microfinance Information \neXhange (MIX), a growing source for financial and social performance data, and to which a large number of Asian \nMFIs have started to report to, tracks information specific to women. As the program will cover several countries, \nPFIs, and MFIs, it is not possible to accurately predict the overall impact on women. However, it is possible to \nmonitor the impact on women through MIX and the intention is to report this data on a regular basis, although no \nspecific action plan on gender is being prepared.   \nKey actions.
