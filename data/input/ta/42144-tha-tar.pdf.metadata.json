The Government of Thailand (the Government) has requested grant financing from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to support the development of e-learning curricula and a school \nnetworking program for education services at the elementary school level. A concept paper for \ntechnical assistance on Capacity Building and School Networking for Educational Services (e-\nLearning) in Thailand was prepared and approved in September 2007. The proposal was then \nsent to the Government of the Republic of Korea for approval of funding under the Republic of \nKorea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. The technical assistance (TA) was approved \nfor financing of $500,000 under the fund. \n \n2.  Support for developing information technology infrastructure for education will improve \nthe curriculum and expand educational opportunities for Thai children in rural areas and further \ncontribute  to  Thailand\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  its  economic  productivity  and  competitiveness. \nAlthough  the  TA  lies  outside  the  scope  of  the  Country  Partnership  strategy  (CPS),1  the \nGovernment requested that ADB consider this project on an exceptional basis.2 This request \nwas made prior to the finalization of the CPS and shortly after the completion of ADB\u2019s Higher \nEducation Development Loan.3 The Government turned to ADB to support this priority e-\nlearning initiative because of ADB\u2019s long-standing experience in Thailand\u2019s education sector \nand its ability to draw upon expertise and best practices from within the Asia and Pacific Region. \nThe TA is included in the TA pipeline for 2008.4 A Fact Finding Mission from ADB Thailand \nResident Mission was fielded during 13\u201316 May 2008 in Bangkok to discuss the scope of \nassistance and implementation arrangements for the proposed TA with the Government and a \nkey stakeholder. This report reflects the findings of the mission and the understandings reached \nwith the Government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Education is a crucial long-term solution to poverty. The 10th National Economic and \nSocial  Development  Plan  of  Thailand  emphasizes  the  importance  of  strengthening  human \ncapital through educational development to achieve and sustain economic growth and social \ndevelopment. The plan includes a target for average test scores at every level of education to \nbe higher than 55%. The average national test score of 55% is already achieved by most \nprivileged elementary and secondary schools in Bangkok. However, there is a big gap among \nschools in Thailand.5 While students in a small number of privileged schools tend to be more \nsuccessful in education, winning national and international awards, students from underfunded \nschools in remote areas tend to have much lower national test scores and less enthusiasm or \neagerness to learn. Common problems in underfunded schools are the lack of teachers of some \nsubjects  and  shortages  of  learning  materials,  especially  those  utilizing  new  media  and \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2007. Country Partnership Strategy 2007 \u2013 2011: Thailand. Manila. \n2 This TA is envisaged to be ADB\u2019s last intervention in Thailand\u2019s education sector unless ADB support for education \nbecomes a core strategic area of partnership as a result of the midterm review of the existing CPS, or in the course \nof preparing a new CPS in 2011.  \n3 ADB. 2006. Project Completion Report on the Higher Education Development Project in Thailand (Loan 1699-THA). \nManila. \n4 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 July 2008. \n5 National test results in 2007 for grade 6 students show that the average scores for schools in Bangkok exceeded \n55% in mathematics, sciences, and English, while the average for the rest of the country in these subject was \nlower than 50%.  \n ", "2   \ntechnology. The study Guidelines for Managing Education for Best Practices Schools,6 which \ncompared  communication  technology  between  privileged  schools  and  others,  found  very \ndifferent educational standards in Thailand\u2019s schools, which number more than 40,000. Over \n80% of the schools need immediate improvement in educational quality. Further support and \nassistance to strengthen the capacity of these schools is needed to promote equality of access \nto education for all and to improve the quality of education. \n \n4.  The  10th  National  Plan  emphasizes  the  use  of  information  and  communication \ntechnology  (ICT)  in  education.  Computer  technology  has  become  an  indispensable  aid  to \neducation, and government policies have focused on improving ICT infrastructure, developing \neducational curriculum content, and enabling universal access to the internet. ICT can help \ndeliver high-standard curricula from privileged schools in Bangkok to schools throughout the \ncountry by allowing teachers to access the same curricular contents. So far, e-learning courses \nfor  elementary  education  in  Thailand  exist  only  in  the  form  of  distance  learning  television \nbroadcasts.  Teachers  and  students  in  recipient  schools  cannot  actively  participate  in  the \nteaching and learning process through this type of e-learning. The study mentioned in para. 3 \nfound  that  teachers  in  best-practice  schools7  organize  varieties  of  instructional  activities, \nintegrate knowledge from many subjects, and encourage students to think and apply knowledge. \nOn  the  other  hand,  many  teachers  in  underfunded  schools  in  remote  areas  do  not  have \nappropriate  expertise  in  subject  matter  or  teaching  methodologies  to  teach  the  assigned \ncourses,  and  limited  teacher  numbers  often  mean  that  one  teacher  has  to  teach  several \nsubjects. Through e-learning, teachers from best-practice schools and other schools can share \nexpertise, knowledge, and teaching methods, and students can learn from different educational \ninnovations. E-learning will also help widen access to training for the teaching professionals and \nbetter curricula for students. \n \n5.  Thailand has 16 demonstration schools established by universities that offer degrees in \neducation. Apart from being a normal school, a demonstration school serves as a real-life \nworkshop and testing ground for university students wishing to enter the teaching profession. \nDemonstration schools provide hands-on education to the university\u2019s teachers in training. Most \ndemonstration schools are acknowledged as best-practice schools. The demonstration school \nat Chulalongkorn University, which is acknowledged as one of the top best-practice schools in \nThailand, was established in 1958 under the Faculty of Education. The school aims to foster \nstudents\u2019 intellectual and moral development, as well as encourage creativity, self confidence, \nand proper self-expression in both Thai and international contexts. ICT training, especially in the \nbasic use of computers and access to information sources via the internet, is an important part \nof the curriculum at the demonstration school at Chulalongkorn University.  \n \n6.   The national budget to the education sector has remained fairly constant at the average \nof 3.9% of gross domestic product, or 23% of the national budget, during 1997\u20132007. Although \nthis is a generous portion of the budget, it is not enough to help improve the quality of teaching \nand learning for over 30,000 public primary schools throughout the country. Internet-based e-\nlearning can serve as a low-cost solution to improve the quality of learning and teaching, as \nschools need only a computer and internet access to hook up with an e-learning system. Since \nits  mission  is  to  be  a  leader  in  education  research  and  development,  the  Chulalongkorn \nUniversity Demonstration Elementary School has volunteered to develop e-learning initiatives at \n                                                 \n6 National Research Council of Thailand. 2005.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  of  the  TA  is  improved  national  test  scores  for  students  in  schools \nparticipating  in  the  e-learning  program,  which  will  lead  to  greater  opportunities  for  higher \neducation. The TA outcome is the implementation of e-learning courses for three core subjects \nof the national test\u2014science, mathematics, and English\u2014for grade 6 students.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  have  three  major  outputs:  (i)  e-learning  course  content  (mathematics, \nscience, and English); (ii) an e-learning system network with a training module; and (iii) a \ndemonstration  school  network  conference.  The  curriculum  for  the  three  subjects  will  be \ndeveloped by the task force at the Chulalongkorn University Demonstration Elementary School \nin collaboration with teachers from the 50 participating schools.8 Then the contents of each \nsubject module will be specially designed to fit web pages. The e-learning system architecture \nwill be developed, and the e-content pages will be test run and adjusted. Once the test run is \ncompleted, teachers from remote schools will be trained to use the system. Training handbooks \nwill be used for training and serve as manuals for the teachers to continue to actively participate \nin the e-learning program. Towards the end of the Project, a demonstration school network \nconference will be conducted with presentations by the project team, an international expert, \nand representatives from other demonstration schools. \n \n9.  The TA will undertake the following activities: \n(i)  Formulate and design e-learning course content. Through a survey workshop, \nissues and problems related to the course content of each subject and teaching \nmethodology in the existing curriculum in participating elementary schools in \nremote areas will be identified. The course content of the three core subjects for \ngrade 6 students will be developed with the aim to better prepare students for the \nnational test. The course content will then be put into digital format suitable for \nrunning on web pages. \n(ii)  Implement e-learning system network. The e-learning system network will be \ndeveloped and tested. The e-contents of the three subjects that are to be taught \nthrough the system will be made available in multimedia format and transferred \nto databases to be stored in the main server at the Chulalongkorn University \nElementary Demonstration School. The information in the database will be used \nas teaching materials and will be accessible by teachers and students in the 50 \nparticipating schools through the internet. A training workshop will be conducted \nfor teachers from 50 schools on how to use the completed system. \n(iii)   Organize  the  demonstration  school  network. To enhance collaboration in \nteaching development and e-learning, the first conference of the demonstration \n                                                 \n8  Fifty schools will be selected from every geographical region of Thailand. As part of the selection criteria, these \nschools will need to have stable internet access (broadband access), teachers with basic IT skills, and a clear \ncommitment to participate and maintain the e-learning program. These selection criteria will also help to mitigate \nthe potential risks of a sustainable e-learning program, including slow data transfer through the internet, teachers \nwith insufficient IT skills, and inadequate budgets for maintaining the schools\u2019 computers. \n ", "4   \nschool network will be organized to share the experience of this project with other \ndemonstration  schools  and  to  agree  on  a  regular  meeting  schedule  of  the \ndemonstration  school  network  and  future  agenda.  Regular  trainings  and \nworkshops on e-learning for demonstration schools and affiliated schools will be \nheld at the network center after the first conference. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide $500,000. \nThe  TA  will  be  financed  as  a  grant  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership  Fund  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining \n$250,000 equivalent in-kind through the provision of a network server, computer equipment, e-\nlearning center space, counterpart staff, and other support. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  Chulalongkorn University will be the Executing Agency, and Chulalongkorn University \nDemonstration  Elementary  School  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA).  A  task  force \ncomprising teachers and administrative staff has been formed at the Chulalongkorn University \nDemonstration  Elementary  School  to  oversee  the  formulation  of  e-learning  content; \nimplementation of the whole e-learning system; and organization of the workshop, training, and \nconference. \n \n12.  The ADB project team and the IA will work closely with Korea Education and Research \nInformation Services (KERIS). KERIS has extended an invitation to the e-learning project team \nto visit KERIS and Korean schools participating in e-learning programs.  The TA will finance key \nmembers of the task force together with the team leader of the consulting team to visit Republic \nof Korea.  ADB will approve the list and number of members from this task force who will benefit \nfrom the TA funding to join the study tour. \n \n \n13.  A team of international and national consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nselection method will be for individual consultants under a lump sum contract. The TA will \nprovide  12.5  person-months  of  consulting  services,  1  international  and  11.5  national.  The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over the period of 12 months, tentatively from September \n2008 to August 2009. A survey will be conducted in the first month to identify the needs of the \n50 participating schools. Interim reports for each activity (i) and (ii) will be delivered at the end of \nmonth 3. The test-run of the e-learning system will be done during months 4 and 5, with a test \nrun workshop to be organized during the period. An e-learning system training handbook will be \nprepared during month 5, and an e-learning training workshop will be organized for month 7, by \nwhich time the system will be fully functional. The final deliverable by all national consultants is \na properly functioning e-learning system, certified by a confirmation letter from the IA to ADB. \nFor  the  international  consultant,  the  deliverable  will  be  a  paper  to  be  presented  at  the \nnetworking conference to be organized in month 10. At the end of the project, the IA will submit \nto ADB an e-learning program sustainability plan.  \n \n ", "  5\n15.  Equipment will be procured by ADB in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The shopping method is anticipated to be used in \nprocuring  the  liquid  crystal  display  (LCD)  projectors  and  personal  computers  (PCs).  Only \nmoderate specifications will suffice for the required 50 LCD projectors (to be distributed to 50 \nremote schools for use in teaching) and 125 PCs (75 at the e-learning center for training and \nworkshops, and 50 to be distributed to 50 remote schools to connect to the e-learning platform). \nThe equipment procured under the TA will be handed over at no cost to the IA and the \nparticipating schools.  \n \nIV.
