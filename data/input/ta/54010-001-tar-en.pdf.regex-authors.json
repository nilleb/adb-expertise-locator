The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide Pacific developing member \ncountries (DMCs) with capacity-building, policy advice, and project preparation support for a \nseries of ensuing projects: the Water and Sanitation Project (Cook Islands); the South Tarawa \nWater  Supply  Project,  additional  financing  (Kiribati);  the  Urban  Planning  Project  (Solomon \nIslands); and the Kosrae Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Federated States of Micronesia). \nThe TA is included in the Pacific Regional Operations Business Plan, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).1 \n \n2.  The TA will support the following strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u2013\n2020:2 enabling value creation by promoting livable and economically vibrant urban areas; \nsupporting projects that will help governments follow long-term urban planning to ensure that \nurban services can be sustained; and encouraging private sector and civil society organization \ninvolvement in the provision of urban infrastructure and services. The TA will also support the \nPacific Approach in providing (i) stronger, faster, and more sustainable project delivery through \nthe expanded use of differentiated regional approaches and mechanisms; and (ii) improved \ngeneration and sharing of knowledge. \n \n3.  Pacific island countries are rapidly urbanizing. Internal migration is increasingly attracted \nto towns, as urban areas become centers of commerce, seats of government, and places of \nopportunity and hope (footnote 2). In seven of the 14 Pacific DMCs (the Cook Islands, Fiji, the \nMarshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, and Tuvalu), more than half the population lives in urban \nareas. Urbanization rates are increasing in all Pacific DMCs except the Cook Islands and Samoa.3 \nAt current urbanization rates, the urban population of Papua New Guinea is expected to double \nin 25 years, while the urban population of the Solomon Islands is expected to double in 17 years \nand that of Vanuatu is expected to double in 16 years. However, urban growth has been largely \nunplanned, resulting in inadequate basic urban infrastructure services such as water supply, \nsanitation, flood control, solid waste management, and urban transport; and a shortage of \naffordable serviced land and housing.4 Larger DMCs that are still predominantly rural, such as the \nSolomon Islands, have the highest urbanization growth rates, driving a growing interest in urban \ninfrastructure  investment.  In  small,  low-lying  atoll  countries  such  as  the  Marshall  Islands, \nunplanned urbanization is increasing the exposure of people and critical urban assets to disasters \nand climate change risks. Risk-informed development could reduce this exposure. \n \n4.  Urbanization provides significant opportunities for social and economic development\u2014\ne.g., through greater economies of scale in the provision of basic social services, or through \nincreased innovation and productivity resulting from the agglomeration of people. However, \nunplanned  urban  growth  in  the  Pacific  island  countries  is  contributing  to  environmental \ndegradation as the number of under-serviced informal settlements rises and vulnerability to \nclimate change and natural hazards such as flooding increases. Major investments are needed \nto improve urban planning and infrastructure and help the Pacific island countries\u2019 towns and \ncities become livable, economically vibrant, and climate resilient. \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

Although the need for investment is great, most Pacific DMCs have limited capacity to \nprepare, manage, and coordinate major investments. They lack revenue streams to finance, \nsustain, and service such investments, while urban service delivery lacks accountability. To \novercome these weaknesses, significant capacity building will be required. \n \n6.  Previous ADB urban projects in Pacific DMCs have highlighted the need to increase the \ncapacity of institutions and staff to sustainably operate water supply and sanitation facilities and \noperations. Low capacity exists within institutions and among decision makers where a basic \nunderstanding of water supply and sanitation operations is often lacking. However, to ensure the \nsustainability of water supply and sanitation systems, experience has shown that capacity building \nmust be accompanied by physical investments.5 \n \n7.  Recent ADB TA projects in the Pacific have supported the preparation of urban sector \nanalyses, reviewed urban policies, and conducted project preparatory-related assessments.6 A \ndemand-driven approach and close consultations with host governments have contributed to \nsuccessful project outcomes. However, the largely single-country focus of these projects limited \ntheir scope and slowed ADB\u2019s response time to new requests for technical assistance and \ncapacity  development.  Pacific  DMCs  continue  to  request  ADB  support  in  preparing  urban \ndevelopment projects, building capacity, identifying technical needs, and building knowledge. This \nTA facility is designed to respond to these requests. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Feasibility studies on ensuing urban development projects prepared. The \nTA will provide support to Pacific DMCs to prioritize, plan, and prepare investments projects for \npotential ADB financing. This will include all kinds of necessary due diligence; assessment of \ntechnical suitability; economic, financial and social viability; capacity and institutional issues; \nprocurement due diligence; address environmental and social safeguards; address social gender \nneeds  and  ensure  gender  mainstreaming;  and  identify  measures  to  strengthen  project \nimplementation capacity for urban investment projects. This will enhance the efficiency of project \npreparation,  address  cross-cutting  issues,  and  will  reduce  the  transaction  costs  through \nminimizing  the  need  for  stand-alone  transaction  TAs.  Detailed  activities  will  include,  when \nrequired: (i) feasibility studies required for the ensuing investment; (ii) economic analysis;7  \n(iii) financial management assessment, financial evaluation and financial analysis; (iv) gender \nanalysis,  collection  of  baseline  data  and  gender  action  plans;  (v)  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement plans; (vi) social safeguards documents on environment, involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples; and (vii) sector assessments. \n \n9.  Initially, output 1 will mainly support feasibility studies on two ensuing urban development \nprojects: the Water and Sanitation Project (Cook Islands) and the Kosrae Water Supply and \nSanitation Project (Federated States of Micronesia). Limited support is anticipated for the South \nTarawa Water Supply Project additional financing (Kiribati) and the Urban Planning Project \n(Solomon Islands). Once additional TA funding is available, additional feasibility support will be \n \n5  ADB. 2015. Sustainability of Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Operations: Findings and Lessons.

Appropriate approval for the increase in the \nTA amount and minor change in scope will be requested accordingly. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Demand-driven  urban  technical  advice,  assessment,  and  capacity \ndevelopment assistance provided. The TA will provide on-demand specialist support, technical \nadvice, assessment, diagnostics, and other analytical work and capacity-building support to \nPacific DMCs to enhance the sustainability of urban investments. Activities under this output will \nbe undertaken with the engagement of government staff and national institutions, through on-the-\njob and other forms of training, to help build country capacity and create a cadre of national staff \nwho are familiar with the critical elements of preparing urban investments. Support will focus on \ndemand-driven diagnostic analysis and financial planning (e.g., water or waste tariff reviews). \nOther areas of support will include independent peer reviews, collection and maintenance of \naccurate and sex-disaggregated data required for policy formulation, value-for-money analysis in \nurban  investment  planning,  disaster  risk  assessment,  and  capacity  building  in  gender \nmainstreaming. The TA will also support policy dialogue, negotiations, and informed decisions in \ndesigning  regulatory  frameworks  and  devising  investment  options.  ADB  will  evaluate  all \ngovernment requests under this output. Requests should be linked to ongoing or immediately \nensuing urban investments and programs within the core TA priority areas (but not necessarily \nlinked to ADB potential investments) and should be outside the scope of ongoing assistance by \nother development partners. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Knowledge  sharing  among  Pacific  developing  member  countries \nenhanced. The TA will support the organization of various regional training, workshops, and \nconferences to enhance knowledge sharing among ADB Pacific DMCs and apex regional urban \nbodies. The TA will also support, when required, the production of knowledge products, taking \ninto consideration lessons from the formulation of laws and infrastructure investment experiences, \nhuman resource capacity development, and gender mainstreaming in urban projects in the Pacific. \nIn particular, the TA will support the Pacific Water and Wastewater Association in organizing the \nannual Pacific Water Conference, and will work in close collaboration with ADB\u2019s urban and water \nsector groups to collect and disseminate lessons and knowledge products to policy makers, line \nministries, urban planners in Pacific DMCs, and within ADB. Where applicable, the Pacific Water \nand  Wastewater  Association8 and  the  Pacific  Regional  Infrastructure  Facility9 Water  and \nSanitation Sector Working Group may be mobilized to assist in this process. This output will help \nincrease awareness of other countries\u2019 activities and strengthen links and networking for future \ncollaboration. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1.6 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6 and TASF-Others). The \ngovernment will provide in-kind contribution, which is estimated to be about $100,000. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n13.  The participating governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe governments have been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \n \n8  www.pwwa.ws. \n9  www.theprif.org. \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA activities for an ensuing project will start only after ADB approves the project \nconcept paper on the ensuing project. Ensuing projects expected to be supported by the TA in \nterms of feasibility studies and project preparation are listed in Appendix 2 and are expected to \nbe approved during the 2020\u20132021 period. \n \n15.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  and  implementing  agency \nresponsible  for  consultant  recruitment  in  close  consultation  with  participating  governments. \nConcurrence will be sought from participating governments for short-listing of consultants. ADB\u2019s \nmain government counterpart in each country will assist ADB in identifying the TA focal agency \nbased on the scope of the government\u2019s requests. The participating governments will mobilize \nkey government staff and national organizations to participate in undertaking analytical work and \nreceiving technical advice through on-the-job experience or appropriate training to help build \ncountry capacity for urban development. Close coordination will be maintained with resident \nmissions, other development partners, and relevant regional organizations and bodies during TA \nimplementation. \n \n16.

Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions.10 The TA will \nfinance national and international consulting services. It is expected that consulting firms will be \nrecruited to deliver project feasibility and preparation assistance (output 1), while individual \nconsultants will be recruited to deliver demand-driven technical advice and capacity development \n(outputs 2 and 3).

Since the TA facility \nwill be responsive to DMC requests within each of the forthcoming projects, full terms of reference (TORs) will be \ndeveloped at that stage. The Procurement, Portfolio, and Financial Management Department (PPFD) will undertake \ndetailed review of consulting firm TORs during request for proposal issuance stage (or earlier, upon request). Since \nindividual consultant selection TORs are not included within the TA report, PPFD will review them on request prior \nto the consulting services recruitment notice. \n ", "5 \nwill be preferred. The consultants will consist of urban development specialists and engineers as \nprimary experts, including financial, business, legal, procurement, social, environmental, and \ngender  experts,  and  other  experts  as  required.  The  experts  will  have  experience  in  their \nrespective fields and demonstrate sound technical knowledge of  urban development. Also, \nresource persons may be engaged with specialized expertise for very short-term work through \nresource person engagements. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The \nTA will be implemented over 60 months, commencing in May 2020. \n \nE.  Governance \n \n18.  Since ADB is the executing agency, the financial management, procurement, and integrity \nrisks during TA implementation are assessed to be low. However, the TA will support thorough \nfinancial management, procurement, and integrity risk assessments for the ensuing investment \nprojects in the target countries.11 \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Pacific Urban Development Investment Project Enhancement and Capacity Development \nFacility, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n11 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nAsian Development Banka   \n1.
