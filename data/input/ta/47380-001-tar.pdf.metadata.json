INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Trade facilitation is one of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nProgram\u2019s four priority sectors.1 As described in the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation \nStrategy (TTFS), 2 trade facilitation program features two components: (i) customs-related work \nto  cover  concerted  customs  reform,  modernization,  and  cross-border  cooperation;  and  (ii) \nintegrated trade facilitation to promote efficient regional trade logistics services, priority trade \ncorridor development, application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures, adoption of single \nwindows through enhanced interagency coordination, corridor performance measurement and \nmonitoring  (CPMM),  and  private  sector  participation. 3  A  midterm  review 4  of  the  TTFS \ndocumented achievements registered in the initial phase of TTFS implementation and identified \nareas where further work is needed. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The midterm review produced a refined TTFS (CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation \nStrategy  2020)  and  implementation  action  plan,  approved  by  the  12th  CAREC  Ministerial \nConference on 24 October 2013.5 The refined TTFS, referenced as an integral part of this TA \nreport, aims to strengthen interagency coordination and increase private sector participation to \nfacilitate trade, develop an efficient regional trade logistics service sector, and monitor TTFS \nimplementation. Priority actions include (i) continuing to conduct CPMM while expanding its \ncoverage to capture data on the performance of trade logistics service providers, and making \nbetter  use  of the  CPMM  database  to  inform policy  formulation,  investment  decisions,  and \ntransport  operations;  (ii)  strengthening  mechanisms  for  public\u2013private  dialogue,  particularly \nthrough augmenting the CAREC Federation of Carrier and Forwarder Associations (CFCFA) \ncapacity  and  ensuring  its  sustainability;  and  (iii)  furthering  capacity  building  for  CAREC \ncountries in trade facilitation.6 As the lead development partner for trade facilitation programs \nunder CAREC, ADB is requested to finance regional TA to support these priority actions. \n \n3.  This TA is designed to support implementation of the refined TTFS. In this respect, it \ncontinues and expands upon efforts initiated under CAREC: Working with the Private Sector in \nTrade Facilitation by providing operational data to monitor TTFS implementation.7 The TA is \nalso consistent with the ADB\u2019s strategic priorities for 2014\u20132020 as outlined in the Midterm \nReview  of  Strategy  2020,  which  calls  for  greater  attention  to  trade  facilitation,  expanding \n                                                \n1  CAREC was established in 1997 to promote development through cooperation among participating countries: \nAfghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of China, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. CAREC is an alliance of six multilateral agencies: Asian Development \nBank (ADB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the Islamic \nDevelopment Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. Priority sectors for \ncooperation are (i) transport, (ii) trade facilitation, (iii) trade policy, and (iv) energy. \n2  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nconnectivity  and  extending  value  chains,  and  support  for  second-generation  of  regional \ncooperation and integration initiatives focusing on productivity-led growth. Consultations were \nconducted with CFCFA members, other CPMM partners, and CAREC country trade facilitation \nsector focal points throughout 2013\u20132014 (in connection with a midterm review of the original \nTTFS and at senior officials\u2019 meetings [SOMs]) to determine the TA impact, outcome, outputs, \nand  implementation  arrangements.  The TA  is included  in  the  CAREC  list  of  medium-term \npriority projects endorsed by the ministerial conference. The SOM expressed broad agreement \non key aspects of the TA and provided strong support for its design and implementation. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.8 \n \n4.  The private sector has played an integral role in CAREC trade facilitation. To monitor \nTTFS implementation and CAREC corridor performance, ADB (funded initially from ADB\u2019s TA \nfor Integrated Trade Facilitation Support for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation), \ntogether with CFCFA member associations, launched CAREC CPMM in 2009.9 CPMM features \nan  elaborate  operational  methodology  used  to  assess  transportation  effectiveness  and \nefficiency of border procedures in CAREC. Vehicle drivers and freight forwarders recruited by \nCFCFA member associations gather detailed information on time and cost spent in transporting \ngoods across the six CAREC corridors. (Memorandums of understanding governing traffic data \ncollection and submission to ADB have been signed with transport carrier and freight forwarder \nassociations  in  most  CAREC  countries.)  This  information  helps  identify  constraints  and \nbottlenecks  hindering  the  flow  of  goods  within  the  region  and  provides  critical  inputs  in \nformulating viable solutions. CPMM supports policy reforms to improve transport links and \nfacilitate trade between CAREC member countries. \n \n5.  CPMM plays a critical role for ADB, other development partners, and CAREC countries. \nA regional project approved in 2013 by ADB relied on CPMM data to identify key  border \ncrossing points where investments are urgently needed to reduce bottlenecks.10 CPMM data will \nbe instrumental in assessing project impact and outcome. A World Bank evaluation of supply \nchain efficiency in Central Asia relies on CPMM data to support its analysis.11 The United States \nAgency for International Development is also using CPMM data to assess the impact of its \ninvestments  in  Afghanistan.  The  annual  CAREC  development  effectiveness  review  (DEfR) \nmandates that the benefits of CAREC corridors be maximized by identifying\u2014and eliminating\u2014\nkey nonphysical barriers to cross-border transport. CPMM data contribute four trade facilitation \nindicators to the DEfR, thus guiding fulfillment of this mandate. Kazakhstan hosted a workshop \non maximizing the use of CPMM data to improve corridor performance. \n \n6.  CPMM coverage has recently expanded to include traffic originating in, terminating in, or \ntransiting Pakistan and Turkmenistan. The June 2013 CAREC SOM supported the continuation \nand refinement of CPMM. The scope of CPMM is expanding to gather more railway data. But \nfurther work is needed to enrich and make best use of CPMM, including: (i) creating metrics to \ncapture trade facilitation contributions of trade logistics services; (ii) more thoroughly mining the \nCPMM database to extract valuable information for policymakers, investment decision-makers, \ninventory  managers,  and  fleet  managers;  (iii)  further  strengthening  the  capacity  of  partner \n                                                \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 March 2014. \n9  ADB. 2007.

The June 2014 SOM, encouraging \nCAREC countries to take further measures to address identified obstacles and improve corridor \nperformance, noted the suggestions for CPMM refinements. \n \n7.  As recognized in the TTFS midterm review, customs cooperation alone cannot address \nall trade facilitation issues. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement \nhighlights the need to enhance collaboration among many agencies, including those in charge \nof transport, trade, customs services, and other cross-border activities.12 Other stakeholders \nalso need to be involved: private sector engagement is instrumental to ensure trade-facilitating \nmeasures enjoy broad support. Private companies face multiple difficulties in trading across \nborders in most CAREC countries, particularly (i) lack of coordinated border management, (ii) \npoor  regional  and  interregional  cooperation  to  address  cross-border  trade  issues,  (iii) \ninadequate investment in infrastructure and trade logistics services, and (iv) high behind-the-\nborder costs. These costs affect the private sector, which often lacks the means to comply with \ncomplex rules. The compliance costs for customs and border procedures and other non-tariff \nmeasures are significant relative to trade volumes. Comprehensive strategies and actions are \nneeded to remove such constraints, and private sector stakeholders need to be involved in \ndesigning, implementing, and monitoring such strategies and action plans. \n \n8.  To initiate and encourage private sector engagement, ADB approved TA for CAREC: \nWorking with the Private Sector in Trade Facilitation, which supported establishing the CFCFA. \nApart from the role played by many of its members in contributing to CPMM, CFCFA has \nbecome an increasingly coherent advocate of the private sector in recommending how best to \nfacilitate  trade.  At  the  country  level,  its  members  engage  regulators  and  policymakers  in \ndialogue. Regionally, CFCFA has organized outreach events, is developing a core curriculum of \nprofessional  training  programs,  and  is  taking  over  as  custodian  of  its  website.  Formally \nregistered in Hong Kong, China, it has provided regular updates to CAREC SOMs, Customs \nCooperation Committee gatherings and the CAREC Transport Sector Coordination Committee. \n \n9.  To give clarity and focus to its work, CFCFA established three working groups: (i) \nstandardization  and  adoption  of  international  best  practices,  (ii)  cross-border  and  corridor \ndevelopment, and (iii) organization development and funding. The groups write annual work \nplans for CFCFA, engage with policymakers, and strive to  make CFCFA a self-sustaining \nfederation. At its August 2013 annual meeting, CFCFA identified issues encountered in shipping \nacross borders\u2014such as differences in pallet and container sizes and rules on truck sizes and \nweights\u2014that result in delays and additional costs for CFCFA members. Involving private sector \nstakeholders  may  accelerate  progress  on  the  adoption  of  common  standards.  Industry-led \npromulgation of standards (shipping container dimensions, telecommunication protocols, etc.) \nhas introduced greater efficiency in other contexts and can help to overcome trade obstacles in \nCAREC. Vehicle weight restrictions (axle loads) and pallet dimensions, for instance, differ from \none country to the next. Agreement among CFCFA members on such matters can provide a \nbasis for country-level discussions, leading eventually to regional accord. \n \n10.  CFCFA also examined issues related to insuring vehicles and goods in transit. Members \nagreed to identify and develop common standards that might be applied regionally to minimize \nthe time and cost of cargo transshipment and cross-border transport. They commissioned an \noverview of insurance product offerings applicable to cross-border movements within CAREC. \n \n                                                \n12 CAREC countries that have acceded to the WTO include the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, \nMongolia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. \n ", "4   \n11.  CFCFA members recognize the value they derive from CFCFA and are prepared to pay \nmembership dues. Now in CFCFA custody, the website can be used to generate revenue. As \nCFCFA seeks to ensure its sustainability, there is merit in continuing to provide transitional TA \nsupport for further capacity-building initiatives. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be expanded trade among CAREC countries and with global markets via \nCAREC corridors such that, by 2020, the value of interregional trade increases fivefold (from \n2005 baseline: $7.961 billion) and cost incurred at a border crossing point clearance decreases \nby 20% to $149 (from 2010 baseline: $186). The outcome will be sustainable, safe, and user-\nfriendly transport and trade networks (and corresponding institutional frameworks) developed for \nCAREC. By 2018: (i) CFCFA membership will increase from 19 members (in 2013) to 25 \nmembers; and (ii) speed with delay to travel 500 kilometers (km) on CAREC corridor section will \nincrease by 30% to 30.0 km per hour (from 2010 baseline: 23.5 km per hour). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The impact and outcome will be achieved through the delivery of TA outputs, including: (i) \nconducting and expanding CPMM to quantify the contributions of trade logistics services and \ncarrying out more insightful research, using CPMM data to yield valuable insights for policy \nformulation and improved operations; (ii) strengthening CFCFA to ensure its sustainability, and \nsupporting  its  working  groups  to  increase  its  relevance;  and  (iii)  increasing  private  sector \nparticipation  by  supporting  industry-generated  standards  to  facilitate  cross-border  trade. \nSustained conduct of CPMM will continue to inform key stakeholders, the CAREC DEfR, and \ndevelopment partners on the performance of CAREC corridors and progress toward achieving \nthe  impact  and  outcome  of  associated  investments.  Proactive  responses  to  address \nshortcomings identified by CPMM will help ensure TA impact. Through improved public\u2013private \ndialogue  (leading  to  agreement  on  a  series  of  industry-inspired  CAREC-wide  standards), \ncomprehensive monitoring of and reporting on corridor performance, and effective delivery of \ncapacity-building programs, the TA aims to ensure the efficient and safe movement of goods \nand people. CAREC-wide standards on such matters as vehicle weight can reduce the need to \ntransfer shipments from one vehicle to another, limiting loss and damage in transit. More robust \nmonitoring  and  analysis  of  corridor  performance  will  prompt  and  guide  improvements  in \ninfrastructure, trade regulation, and border management. Improved trade logistics skill sets will \nyield more efficient service delivery. Engaging stakeholders will help to achieve TA outcome. \n \n14.  Key assumptions include (i) continued implementation by CAREC country governments \nof economic- and trade-related reform programs, particularly the Trade Facilitation Agreement \nobligations undertaken by CAREC WTO members; and (ii) access to reliable railway, customs, \nand trade logistics performance data for CAREC corridors. Possible risks include slow progress \non trade liberalization, incomplete implementation of regional commitments, and uncoordinated \ndevelopment of border-crossing facilities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V); (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a \n ", "  5 \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund;14 and (iii) $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction  Fund  and  administered  by  ADB.  CAREC  governments  and  private  sector \nstakeholders participating in and otherwise benefiting from TA-funded activities will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of translation and interpretation support; venues for training, \nseminars,  and  conferences;  domestic  transportation;  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The \nCAREC Institute and the ADB Institute will be enlisted to share and disseminate best practice as \nwell  as  strengthen  and  expand  public\u2013private  dialogue.  A  detailed  Cost  Estimates  And \nFinancing Plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  A total of 25 person-months of international consultant and 36 person-months of national \nconsultant inputs will be required to provide TA advisory and technical services. The consultants \nwill be specialists in integrated trade facilitation, regional trade logistics, customs reform and \nmodernization,  and  institutional  and  capacity  building,  with  special  expertise  in  crafting \nagreement on common standards and increasing private sector participation in the provision of \ntransport and trade logistics services. Because the TA will involve independent, intermittent, \nlow-level-of-effort  assignments  requiring  more  independent  situation  assessments  and  less \ncoordination of activities, consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB as individuals based \non their qualifications and experience. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended periodically). \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 42 months, from 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2018. \nADB  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  implementing  agency  will  be  CFCFA  constituent \nmembers. As the TA supervising unit, the Public Management, Financial Sector, and Regional \nCooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will administer and implement the TA in \ncollaboration with ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department and resident missions. \n \n18.  Memorandums of understanding will be concluded with CPMM partners to reimburse \nthem for the cost of collecting, compiling, and transmitting to ADB time-cost-distance data \nreviewed and accepted by the internationally recruited CPMM experts. Per-time-cost-distance \ncosts have been established for each CAREC country based on prevailing market conditions. \n \n19.  The  TA  outputs,  particularly  CPMM  reports  and  other  knowledge  products,  will  be \ndisseminated through workshops, seminars, conferences, and via the internet. As appropriate, \noutputs will also be disseminated at events convened by other regional cooperation initiatives. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000  \non a grant basis, for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation: Working with the Private \nSector in Trade Facilitation (Phase 2), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 Established by ADB.
