Justification \n1.  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  is  necessary  to  provide  sound \nevidence to justify proceeding with the loan project. It will define the scope, cost, procedures for \nidentifying subprojects, financing plan, implementation arrangements, procurement strategy, \ntechnology issues, capacity development needs and post-project operation and maintenance \narrangements. It is necessary to establish measures for adherence to the safeguard policies of \nboth the government and Asian Development Bank. The PPTA would provide guidance to \nmaximize the socioeconomic benefits such as impacts on poverty, gender and fair employment \npractices. It would also provide project advance action support. \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will detail a project design that is economically, financially and technically \nfeasible. It will provide advance drafts of the complete set of documentation necessary for the \nADB to proceed with internal processing. It will prepare feasibility studies for representative \nsubprojects (RSP) and comprehensive criteria for road sections, water supply, and agriculture \nand rural value chain (ARVC) infrastructure, and institutional arrangements under the project. \nFeasibility studies will be prepared for two road RSPs, two water supply RSPs, and ARVC \nRSP.1 \n3.  There  are  currently  insufficient  resources  for  the  PPTA  to  prepare  the  Project  to \ncomplete ADB\u2019s readiness filters. Additional resources will be sought during the PPTA but the \ntiming of milestones is presented according to currently allocated resources and will be revised \nif additional resources are secured.
