THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids System\nProject.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. In 1999, the Government requested a loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to\nfinance part of the foreign exchange cost of rehabilitating the navigation aids system in PNG.\nThe improved and more reliable system of navigation aids would contribute to safer and more\nefficient access to PNG ports. The sector and the Project have been accorded high priority by\nthe Government.\n3. The project preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  included  a  sector  review  and  a\nfeasibility  study.  Fact-finding  and appraisal  were  carried  out  in  March  and  June  2000,  to\nformulate the Project and to carry out policy dialogue on sector issues. This report is based on\nthe feasibility report and the findings of the ADB mission.2 The project framework is in Appendix\n1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. Overview\n4. PNG occupies the eastern half of New Guinea island and numerous smaller islands. Of\nthese, Bougainville, New Britain, New Ireland, and Manus are the largest. PNG's population of\n4.2 million is scattered and overwhelmingly rural: 3.5 million, or 84 percent, of people live in\nisolated villages. Fourteen of the 19 provinces and the national capital district in PNG are\ncoastal. The maritime provinces include Bougainville, Central, East and West New Britain, Gulf,\nMadang,  Manus,  Milne  Bay,  Morobe,  New  Ireland,  Oro,  Sandaun,  and  Western.  PNG\u2019s\ncoastline reaches about 6,500 kilometers (km), much of which is accessible only by sea. In\n1990, 12 percent of the population inhabited the island provinces and 44 percent the coastal\nprovinces.3 Coastal populations have poor access to roads, and communities are often distant\nfrom airstrips. Movement of goods and people is primarily by sea for most coastal residents.\nPNG has 17 million hectares of reef-covered coastal waters, making it the largest fishing zone in\nthe Pacific.\n5. As a small, open, island economy, PNG is dependent on maritime transport for the\ndevelopment of vital economic sectors, markets, and social services. The maritime navigation\naids system in PNG has deteriorated over the past 10 years to a state in which maritime\ntransport is negatively affected. As a result 70 of 166 aids are nonoperational, with 14 on\nBougainville  damaged;  43  discontinued  due  to  sustained  vandalism  (i.e.,  all  equipment\nrepeatedly removed, stolen, or damaged); 9 destroyed either through prolonged deterioration,\nvolcanic activity, or by being run down by ships; and 4 out of service due to faulty equipment.\nMost of the damaged navigation aids are on PNG\u2019s most critical coastal routes. The existing\n                                                       \n1  TA 3162-PNG: Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids, for $500,000, approved on 1 February 1999.\n2  The Appraisal Mission comprised S. Jarvenpaa, Sr. Project Specialist/Mission Leader; C. Bantugon, Associate\nProject Analyst; and S. Meyrick, Corporate Specialist (staff consultant).\n3 Source: Population census 1990. The next census will be carried out in 2000.", "2\nsystem of daymarks is not adequate to facilitate safe maritime travel of the island communities.\nMany of these are also in severe need of rehabilitation. Shippers have to make expensive\nadjustments to voyage routes and schedules to overcome the shortcomings in the navigation\naids system. The current condition of the navigation aids system constrains development and\naccess to social services.\n6. About 90 percent of the world\u2019s cargo is transported by sea relying on nautical charts.\nConsequently, most coastal countries place great importance on their coastal management and\ncharting activities. The PNG archipelago comprises about 1.7 million square kilometers (km2) of\nsea area, of which most is inadequately surveyed. Currently, hydrographic survey and charting\nactivity is performed by the Royal Australian Navy under a memorandum of understanding with\nPNG, at a survey rate of about 300 hundred km2 per annum. Currently 55 charts cover PNG\u2019s\ncoastal waters. Most of these are based on old hydrographic and geodetic surveys, which\ndeviate from modern international standards. A great number of shoals and other hazards to\nnavigation were undetected at the time of the survey as measurement points were sparse and\nscattered. Location of many off-lying islets may not be accurately positioned on these charts\ndue to the limitations of the conventional survey methods used.\n2. Poverty\n7. Eighty-five percent of the PNG population lives in the rural areas fragmented by rugged\nterrain and inadequate physical infrastructure. The coastal communities rely on subsistence\nfarming and fishing for their livelihoods, supplemented by a small amount of cash activities\u2014\ntrading in fish, local produce, and in some areas, copra, palm oil, and betel nut. The agriculture\nsector has been stagnant for a long period, averaging growth of only 1 percent per annum.\nRural incomes are approximately only one tenth of those in urban areas. In many coastal\ncommunities, expansion of cash activities will depend on improvements in marine transport,\nsince remoteness and rugged terrain prohibit construction of a road network to effectively link\nthem to inland areas.\n8. While PNG is classified as a low-middle-income country with a 1998 per capita income\nof $890, its social indicators are typical of countries of a much lower income level. According to\nthe World Bank\u2019s 1999 country assistance strategy for PNG, 37 percent of the population now\nlive at or below the poverty line, defined as the minimum income required to support a life-\nsustaining nutritional intake. On the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) human\ndevelopment index, PNG ranks last among Pacific Island countries and 164th of 174 developing\ncountries.4 These indicators make PNG\u2019s human development level the lowest of ADB's Pacific\ndeveloping member countries. The UNDP's 1998 human poverty index value of 72 reflects the\ncountry's poor access to basic services: low life expectancy of 55 years, with about 25 percent\nof women not surviving beyond the age of 40, high infant mortality rate (62 per 1,000 live births),\nprimary and secondary school enrolment of only 55 and 9 percent respectively, and average\nliteracy of 52 percent (40 percent for women).\n9. The disadvantaged in PNG society are disproportionately female. Girls account for only\n33 percent of total school enrolments and women make up only 30 percent of tertiary students.\nRural women have poor access to health care, and life expectancy for rural women is low as a\nresult of prevailing high rates of maternal mortality, poor nutrition, and generally high rates of\nviolence against women. The World Bank\u2019s 1999 country assistance strategy estimates that\nviolence against women is endemic in PNG with 70 percent of all PNG wives battered by their\n                                                       \n4\nUNDP. 1988. Papua New Guinea Human Development Report (draft).", "3\nhusbands. As a result, women have lower living standards than men and suffer more during\ntimes of economic downturn. In most areas, however, women are the prime food producers.\n10. With a high natural growth rate, great geographic dispersion, and 42 percent of the\npopulation under the age of 15, the demand for social services is a serious challenge to the\nGovernment. In coastal communities, disaffection with the Government\u2019s ability to provide these\nservices is pervasive, and contempt for its assets and programs is common. There is increasing\nfrustration with the slow pace of development and the unequal distribution of income between\nurban and rural communities. Social frustration is manifested in the rate of vandalism against\npublic property, and in particular the installations of navigation aids. The Government has\nattempted to address these concerns through the 1995 Organic Law on Provincial Governments\nand  Local-Level  Governments  that  decentralizes  government  administration,  improves\ntransparency, and empowers provincial administrations and community leaders in the provision\nof services in direct consultation with the constituents.\n3. Transport\n11. The transport system is multimodal, dispersed, and in comparison with other low- to\nmedium-income  developing  countries,  undeveloped.  There  are  26,962  km  of  roads;  17\ncommercial ports; numerous government and private wharves, jetties, and landings; 46 airports;\nand hundreds of airstrips. Geographic dispersion of the population and the rugged terrain in\nboth inland and coastal areas imply that a significant portion of high-cost transport infrastructure\nserves relatively few people.\n4. The Maritime Transport Sector\n12. The  maritime  transport  sector  is  dualistic,  with  (i)  a  relatively  well-developed\ninfrastructure serving the main urban areas (Kimbe, Lae, Madang, Port Moresby, and Rabaul)\ncatering to both international and coastal traffic, and (ii) a large number of lesser ports (e.g.,\nAlotau, Kavieng, Oro Bay, Wewak, and others) serving smaller vessels engaged mainly in\ncoastal traffic.\na. Demand Patterns\n13. Imports from overseas are delivered to the main ports of Lae and Port Moresby, and are\nthen distributed throughout the country by road, air, and to the remote coastal communities, by\nsmall coastal vessels. This means that some minor ports are congested, but remain of minor\nimportance in terms of tonnage. Over the past 10 years, vessel calls at all PNG\u2019s ports have\ngrown at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent, rising to 7,486 in 1998. Calls by overseas\nvessels, which doubled to 2,347 in the same period, were responsible for most of the growth,\nwhile coastal vessel traffic growth was relatively stagnant.\n14. The mix of vessel types in PNG waters has significantly changed during the past 10\nyears. In particular, in the overseas trade, the number of calls by container ships and tankers\nhas more than doubled (from 307 per annum in 1988 to 678 in 1998), while calls by the general\nbreak-bulk cargo ships have remained steady, and declined in proportion to other ship-calls.\nCalls by overseas passenger cruise ships are increasing, approximately doubling over the past\n10 years, albeit from a small base. The increase in overseas vessel traffic was recorded by\nships carrying forestry products, rising from zero in 1988 to an average of over 900 calls per\nannum between 1994 and 1998. Forestry, however, has been highly volatile and the increase of\nrelated vessel traffic in PNG waters in recent years cannot be considered permanent.", "4\n15. The most frequently visited ports are Madang and Kimbe, followed by Port Moresby,\nLae, and Rabaul. Vessel traffic, however, does not correlate with cargo throughput, for which\nPort Moresby and Lae are by far the largest ports in PNG. Madang and Kimbe are, however,\nimportant regional ports that cater to small vessels serving passenger traffic, and particularly in\nKimbe, agricultural exports. Port Moresby and Lae, on the other hand, represent PNG\u2019s primary\ninternational ports and handle the bulk of overseas container and international tanker traffic.\nVessel traffic and cargo volumes are in Appendix 2.\n16. Consequently, the priority navigation aids do not only relate to the economic importance\nof the two primary international ports, but also account for the relatively heavy small-vessel\ntraffic in the areas of the regional ports. Passenger traffic, in particular, is a significant concern,\nwith the coastal operators moving well over 1,000 people a day between Lae, Madang, Kimbe,\nKavieng,  Buka,  and  numerous  other  minor  ports  in  the  region.  In  addition,  numerous\nnoncommercial village boats ferry large numbers of passengers by sea, sometimes over great\ndistances in small, open, overloaded craft. Many minor ports that serve this traffic, presently\nhave no navigation aids; this represents a significant risk to passenger safety.\nb. Hydrographic Survey and Charting\n17. Of the 1.7 million km2 of sea area, 10 percent has been adequately surveyed, 5 percent\nof which needs to be surveyed again. Eighty-five percent of the area has not been surveyed and\ncannot, subsequently, be used for maritime travel. The chart ratings given to the existing charts\nproduced by the Royal Australian Navy range between AQ-IA under International Hydrographic\nOffice (IHO) standards. While the AQ indicates that among PNG charts (i) some permit safe\nmarine navigation of vessels routinely operating in any one world maritime area, and that (ii)\ncertain  charts  meet  IHO  Standard,  the  IA  rating  signifies  that  many  of  these  charts  are\ninadequate, and that charts exist that do not meet the minimum standards and are unacceptable\nfor safe navigation.\n18. It is only through nautical charts that the navigators can know the depths, location of aids\nto navigation, navigable routes, and forces of tidal currents. These allow planning of the safest\nand most economic route from one port to another. More importantly, navigators can locate\nalternative routes in case of bad weather or to avoid grounding. The inadequate charting of\nPNG  waters has  an  adverse effect on  the economy.  Hazardous  navigation  and  the  poor\ncondition of navigation aids have translated into higher insurance premiums due to the higher\nrisks.\n19. Modern technology used in navigation, such as the global positioning system (GPS) and\nelectronic chart display and information system, requires a much higher degree of accuracy\nthan is provided in the existing PNG hydrographic charts. Hydrographic data is essential for\nPNG\u2019s maritime and navigational safety; inadequate hydrographic services can lead to delays in\nresource exploration. In the marine environment, there can be no exploitation of resources\nwithout exploration; this requires hydrographic data.\n20. Hydrographic-related  memberships  of  PNG  include  the  United  Nations,  IHO,\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO), Fisheries Department of the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations, and International Association of Lighthouse Authorities.\nUnder IHO criteria, PNG holds no capacity for surveying or charting; has no qualified staff for\nsurveying, map making, or drafting; and possesses no capacity to issue its own hydrographic\ncharts, instructions to mariners, or marine publications.", "5\nc. Navigation Aids System\n21. Currently, 96 navigation aids of  the  total  of  166  are  operational. Seventy aids are\nnonoperational,  with  14  in  Bougainville  damaged,  43  aids  discontinued  due  to  sustained\nvandalism (i.e., all equipment repeatedly removed, stolen, or damaged), 9 aids with weather or\nvolcanic activity-related deterioration, and 4 out of service due to faulty equipment. Most aids\nare in poor condition due to vandalism, environmental deterioration, age of the installation,\ninappropriate design, or inadequate maintenance. The level of vandalism and environmental\ndeterioration correlate with the geographic location, with some areas suffering losses from\npersistent  community  vandalism,  while  other  areas  are  subject  to  severe  annual  weather\npatterns  that  accelerate  deterioration  rates.  Most  aids  are  well  below  the  expectations  of\nmariners and the needs of the maritime transport system in PNG. Also, most of the damaged\naids are on PNG\u2019s critical maritime routes. The system of daymarks is not adequate to facilitate\nsafe  maritime  travel  by  the  island  communities.  Many  of  these  are  in  severe  need  of\nrehabilitation.\nd. Major Shipping Routes\n22. PNG shipping can be categorized as (i) international through traffic, (ii) coastal traffic\nbetween the major ports, and (iii) small vessel traffic serving numerous minor ports. About 2,850\nvessels per year pass through eastern and northern PNG waters on voyages to Asian ports in\nthe Peoples Republic of China, Japan, and Republic of Korea. This traffic is principally bulk\ncarriers, container vessels, and general cargo vessels. There is no traffic in crude oil on these\nroutes. To pass through the north Coral Sea, traffic is evenly divided between two routes:\nJomard Entrance or around Rossel Island. Navigation aids on these routes are vital and need\nattention.  The  most  frequently  used  routes  are  Jomard\u2013Vitiaz  Strait  for  vessels  heading\nnorthwest  to  Hong  Kong,  China  and  the  Philippines;  Jomard\u2013Vitiaz  Strait  west  of  Manus\nProvince for vessels going to the Republic of Korea and southwest Japan; and Jomard\u2013Saint\nGeorges Channel and Rossell northeast of New Ireland Province for vessels on route to Japan.\nThese routes are reasonably well served with navigation aids and charts. The vessels on these\nroutes usually carry radar and GPS, and are subject to inspection by safety authorities. The\nnavigation aids on these routes require less attention. Petroleum products are shipped from the\nKumul oil terminal in the Gulf of Papua. This traffic quickly departs PNG waters and heads for\nTorres Strait.\n23. The coastal routes between the major ports are used by about seven overseas and\nthree major local shipping companies. Large and fast container ships and some petroleum\ntankers also use these routes. The most frequently traveled route is that between Port Moresby\nand Lae with a recorded 230 ship movements in 1998. Significant effort is required to restore\nthe navigation aids on these routes and new aids are required to rectify deficiencies and gaps.\n24. Southwest PNG. The navigation aids on the Ely River are maintained by private mining\nand oil companies. Dary and Bristow aids are adequate for traffic entering the Ely River. The\nKumul oil terminal and Bramble Cay have good lights. There is adequate sea-room between the\nroute used from Kumul oil terminal to Bramble Cay and Torres Straights, and the seaward limit\nof the river bank. Marking the seaward bank is not practicable due to the shifting nature of the\nbank. Eastward, Gouri is used as a timber port and requires a new navigation aid. Lesser ports\nused by coastal traffic need hydrographic charts prior to installation of aids.", "6\n25. Port Moresby West. The majority of coastal vessels use a difficult and narrow inshore\nroute past Haidana Island and Boera Head. Hydrographic charts and the navigation aids on this\nroute  require  considerable  improvement.  The  route  from  Port  Moresby  to  Ava  Point  is\nhazardous with numerous seaward reefs. While large container, bulk, and tanker vessels steer\nfar seaward to avoid these dangers, smaller vessels additionally suffer from risk posed by\nstrong southeastern trade winds for eight months of the year. Both the hydrographic charts and\nthe navigation aids require significant attention.\n26. Southern Approach to the China Straits. Most traffic uses this southeastern end of\nmainland  PNG  through  the  China  Straits  and  is  subject  to  risks  of  deficient  navigation\nconditions. Hydrographic survey on this submerged reef was carried out in 1945, and many\nareas are uncharted. The hydrographic survey needs to precede installation of navigation aids.\nThe China Straits is regularly used by container vessels on route from Port Moresby to Lae, the\ntwo  most  important  ports  in  the  country.  The  tracks  need  to  be  improved  with  new  and\nrefurbished navigation aids.\n27. Raven Channel. Raven Channel is one of the two most important shipping routes in\nPNG waters. This extremely narrow channel is subject to strong tidal streams and risks are\nincreased by uncharted reefs and shoals. Only vessels on route to Europe can avoid Raven\nChannel by taking the similarly risky Bright Island Passage. This passage needs additional\nnavigation aids to improve safety. Raven Channel is proposed to be bypassed by way of a\nnorth-south route west of Nuakata Channel, which can be adequately marked to significantly\nreduce navigation risks. The navigation aids need upgrading to meet their objectives on the\nGoshen  Strait,  one  of  the  principle  routes  north  between  the  mainland\u2019s  eastern  tip  and\nNormanby Island. The route to Lae from Goshen Channel needs a new hydrographic survey\nbecause the route now comes within one nautical mile (nm) of navigational hazards. The route\nserves all coastal vessel traffic between the two main population centers. Star Reef Passage\noffers a wider route to Lae with only 20 nm of confined inshore waters instead of 70 nm on the\nGoshen Channel. It offers no distance savings, but with new navigation aids and increasing\ninstallation of GPS, it will yield safety benefits.\n28. Lae\u2013Madang\u2013Wewak. The two hundred nm of  coastline from  Fortification  Point to\nMadang has no major lights, but there is ample sea room, depths are acceptable at 1,000-1,500\nmeters, and no isolated submerged dangers are near or on the route. The 190 nm of coastline\nfrom Madang to Wewak have four major lights, which is adequate for the coastal traffic.\n29. Sepik River. Sepik River hosts a large number of communities and requires a day-\nmarking system, and replacement of the only light.\n30. Lae to New Guinea Islands. Most international vessels trading with PNG travel to Lae,\nKimbe, Kavieng, and Rabaul. To reach New Britain they use a pass north of Umboi Island. A\nhydrographic survey is needed. High priority additional navigation aids are needed to mark the\nNessup Channel used by smaller coastal vessels. Only two major navigation lights exist on the\nroute from Lae to Rabaul, but the route also has ample sea room, deep water, and no off-lying\ndangers, and is navigated by vessels with radar and GPS. All aids need replacement on the\nroute to Kavieng, and lights on the Gazelle Peninsula need upgrading.\n31. Several local companies operate barges and ferries to numerous minor ports. Many of\nthese ports do not have adequate hydrographic charts nor navigation aids. Safe navigation on\nthese routes relies heavily on the local knowledge of the ship operator. A program for installing\nnew  navigation  aids  is  needed,  particularly  on  the  north  coast  where  there  is  significant", "7\npassenger traffic. Most of the minor ports in the Gulf of Papua feature mangroves and shifting\nmud and sand banks making marking of these routes impracticable.\n32. Navigation aids are required on one new coastal route, the Nuakata Channel; Nessup\nChannel needs significant improvement. The shortest route between Port Moresby and Lae is\nvia the China Straits and Raven Channel, northeast of Milne Bay. It is 190 nm shorter than the\nroute via Jomard Entrance and Kiriwina. Transit of Raven Channel involves high navigational\nrisk, particularly for large vessels, and all international companies give their operator discretion\nto use longer routes. Even if fully marked with navigation aids this channel would be hazardous\ndue to its narrow width, poor angles of approach, and vigorous tidal streams. The new Nuakata\nChannel would enable bypassing of Raven Channel, and be significantly wider and straighter,\nhence greatly reducing the navigational risk. A new metric chart will be available in mid-2000.\nMarking the Nuakata Channel has been endorsed by the shipping industry. Nessup Channel is\nthe southern entrance to Dampier Strait at the western end of New Britain and is used by\nvessels heading for north New Britain, New Ireland, and Rabaul. It is 42 nm shorter than the\nroute north of Omboi Island. The latter route is poorly surveyed. Nessup Channel passes\nthrough extremely confined waters and needs additional navigation aids.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n1. National Planning Framework\n33. The Government\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy  1997-2002  is  the  principal\npolicy guideline for  the  country\u2019s  economic  and  social  development.  It  aims  to  create  an\nenvironment that encourages the local population to use their land, labor, and natural resources\nfor the national benefit. For this, the Government places paramount importance on the provision\nof health and education services, the maintenance of infrastructure, the creation of opportunities\nfor income generation, and the tackling of peace and security problems. The following sectors\nare receiving budget appropriations consistent with the priority areas: (i) rural development and\nagriculture,  (ii)  health,  (iii)  education,  (iv)  infrastructure  maintenance  and  development,  (v)\npeace and security, and (vi) capacity building within institutions at all tiers of government.\n34. The Government\u2019s draft National Transport Infrastructure Plan of May 2000 and the new\nTransport Policy of  2000 (i)  confirm  the  importance  the  Government  assigns  to  transport\ninfrastructure, and (ii) provide sector strategies to maintain, rehabilitate, and improve existing\ntransport  infrastructure;  and  create  new  infrastructure  to  enhance  efficient  production  and\ndistribution of goods and services, and to improve efficiency and integration of the transport\nservices. Provision of safe and integrated maritime transport services and improvement of\nnavigational and hydrographic services are set as objectives for the maritime sector.\n35. In maritime safety, the Government aims to provide navigational support services that\nmeet international standards and are responsive to the needs of transport providers and users.\nIn addition to maintaining a system of visual and radar navigational markers, the Government\u2019s\ngoal is to provide timely and relevant navigational and maritime safety information to shippers.\nThe system would cater not only for the economically most important international and coastal\nroutes, but  also  support  social  services  to  remote  communities.  The  Government\u2019s  policy\nsupports  sector  reorganization  and  proposes  establishment  of  a  maritime  safety  authority\n(MSA).", "8\n2. Maritime Sector Organization\na. Maritime Functions of the Department of Transport and Civil Aviation\n36. Maritime sector management is established under the Merchant Shipping Act of 1980\nand  its  regulations,  and  the  PNG  Harbours  Board  Act  of  1976.  Under  the  former,  the\nGovernment is responsible, through its Department of Transport and Civil Aviation (DOTCA), for\nmaritime safety and navigation aids. This includes responsibility for registration of vessels,\nmaritime  safety,  crew  certification  and  conditions,  maritime  incidents  and  investigations,\nnavigation  aids,  pilotage,  coastal  trading  regulation,  and  liabilities  under  international\nconventions.5  DOTCA, headed  by  a  secretary,  includes  the  Office  of  Transport,  Office  of\nAviation, and Office of Policy Development, each headed by a director. The maritime objectives\nof the Office of Transport coincide with those of the International Convention for the Safety of\nLife at Sea, 1974. They are to ensure that sea transport services are economically efficient, well\nintegrated, technically safe, and adequate to meet the demand. The Office of Transport and its\nMaritime Transport Division (MTD) include (i) ship surveys, inspection, and port state control; (ii)\nnavigation aids; (iii) marine search and rescue; (iv) monitoring and control of oil pollution; (v)\nsmall boat safety awareness and education; and (vi) hydrographic surveys. MTD comprises\nthree branches: (i) Maritime Safety Branch (MSB), (ii) Maritime Industry, and (iii) Shipping\nServices Branch. It has six regional offices: in Alotau, Daru, Lae, Madang, Port Moresby,\nRabaul, and one office in Angoram for inland traffic. Recently, however, due to the shortage of\nrecurrent funds, some of these offices have not been operating. The existing organization\nconsists of a total of 68 staff. An organization chart is in Appendix 3.\nb. Maritime Safety Branch\n37. MSB is responsible for maritime safety within MTD including (i) navigation aids, (ii)\nsearch and rescue, (iii) oil spill and disaster prevention, (iv) ship registration, (v) port state\ncontrol and small boat safety, (vi) hydrographic surveys, and (vii) liabilities under international\nconventions. MSB includes a depot in Madang with a staff of 36, 9 of whom are technical and\nthe rest attached to MSB\u2019s vessels, Sepura and Kulasi. The Madang depot houses an inventory\nof lanterns and mechanical equipment. The search and rescue operations have five 6-meter\ncatamarans, and the hydrographic office a 26-meter hydrographic vessel.\ni. Navigation Aids Operations\n38. The objectives of the navigation aids system in PNG, as in other maritime countries, is to\nprovide a nationally integrated navigational support service that meets international standards\nand is responsive to the needs of transport providers and users. In addition to maintaining a\nsystem of visual and radar navigational markers, the system should provide timely and relevant\nnavigational and maritime safety information to shipowners. The system should cater not only to\nthe  economically  most  important  international  and  coastal  routes,  but  also  support  social\nservices to remote communities.\n39. The present system of navigation aids fails to meet any of these objectives. The technical\naudit of navigation aids carried out under this study found that of the 166 aids in PNG waters,\nnearly all require urgent remedial attention to structures, lighting, or electrical equipment. Only 58\npercent are operating at all, while the remaining 42 percent are nonoperational due to vandalism\n                                                       \n5 An exception to this is pilotage, which is entrusted to the Papua New Guinea Harbours Board.", "9\nor prolonged deterioration. Many of the nonoperational aids have been out of service for years.\nVandalism is the most common and persistent cause of physical failure of the networks  of\nnavigation aids, accounting for 57 of 70, or 81 percent, of failed aids.\n40. When a light or beacon fails, there is usually a considerable delay before the failure is\nreported, and a further delay before it is repaired, if it is repaired at all. Some aids are never\nrepaired due to persistent and apparently unstoppable vandalism. Mariners are not kept informed\nof which navigation aids are not operational, nor are they informed when failures are restored or\nnew aids are installed. As a result, international and coastal shipowners have lost confidence in\nthe system and consider the Government\u2019s management of the system unresponsive to their\nneeds. The level of navigational service that they receive is not worth the fees they are required to\npay in lights dues. Consequently ship operators have had to develop and rely on the \"local\nknowledge\" of their crews in order to deal  with navigational hazards. As a  result,  maritime\ntransport in PNG is inefficient and below an achievable standard. Gains from higher standards\nand volume of maritime transport services, and lower maritime transport costs can be obtained by\nimproving the navigation aids system.\nii. Search and Rescue Operations\n41. The importance of saving lives and property at sea is reflected in the comprehensive\ninternational  convention  regulations  that  govern  public  maritime  services  provision,  e.g.,\nregulations under Safety of Life at Sea and Search and Rescue (SAR) Convention of 1979 under\nInternational  Maritime Organization. Shore-based  services  include  constant  radio  monitoring,\noperation of high-speed rescue craft, and fire-fighting equipment, but may extend to  rescue\nhelicopters, and medical and similar services. SAR services need to be integrated with shipborne\nSafety of Life at Sea equipment. This equipment reflects technological developments in materials\nand equipment. The International Maritime Organization introduced the global maritime distress\nand safety system (GMDSS) in 1997. Land-based SAR arrangements must include highly efficient\ncoordination facilities, full-time monitoring services of radio distress frequencies, and of course the\nmeans to offer help at short notice and at high speed, which means life craft and helicopters on\nconstant standby. If there are offshore platforms in the zone, the SAR organization must also be\nequipped to deal with emergency calls from them.\n42. The SAR function within MSB receives a notification of missing persons at sea, and\ninvestigates and activates a search pattern if deemed necessary. The SAR coordinator has SAR\nresources available for rescue missions. These involve funding for commercial aircraft services\nprovided on  regular flights  in  the  region,  or  hiring  of  a fixed-wing  aircraft  or  helicopters  to\nimplement a search pattern. Delays are frequently experienced in reporting the missing persons\nresulting in an expansion of the search area. A draft cooperative agreement between PNG and\nAustralia is under consideration for undertaking joint-SAR missions. This document corresponds\nto the requirements of (i) the Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944, (ii) the International\nConvention on Maritime Search and Rescue 1979, (iii) the International Convention on Safety of\nLife at Sea 1974, and (iv) the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982.\n43. The potential for loss of life at sea could be greatly reduced if all motorized small craft\nwere  registered,  compulsory  safety  equipment  and  sea-worthiness  requirements  (e.g.\nbuoyancy) were required on small craft, and reporting requirements and safety procedures as\nwell as preferred routes were made mandatory. Implementation of these are proposed to be\ninvestigated under a TA for Remote Maritime Route Improvement included under ADB\u2019s 2000\ncountry program for PNG. Albeit limited in its current coverage to only commercial craft, a bill\nhas also been drafted to cover small craft.", "10\n44. Implementation  of  IMO\u2019s  GMDSS  targets  modernization  of  ship  rescue  operations\nworldwide.  It  has  recommended  that  all  ships  in  international  waters  be  required  to  carry\ncommunications equipment for GMDSS, and that each member country construct land-based\nfacilities to support the system. The global network was intended to be fully operational by\nFebruary 1999. To meet this obligation, in 1996, Japan\u2019s Telecommunications Engineering and\nConsulting  Service  recommended  that  GMDSS  coastal  radio  stations  be  installed  in  Port\nMoresby, Lae, Rabaul, and Wewak, at a total cost of about $8 million under Japanese grant-aid\nfunded by Japan. A later International Telecommunications Union study estimated this system\nwould cost $4.5 million. The Government is currently exploring the possibility of funding such a\nsystem through its telecommunications services.\niii. Oil Spill Prevention and Disaster Response\n45. MSB  has  the  official  responsibility  of  coordinating  oil  spill,  and  safety  and  rescue\noperations in PNG. Oil-spill equipment was procured and delivered under the ADB project loan for\nTransport Infrastructure Development in 1998.6 These include oil spill booms, mechanical floating\nskimmers, and other equipment used in confining and removing oil from waters. Training was\nprovided under the project, and most recently in April 2000. This, however, was intermittent and\nlimited, and the preparedness of the unit is minimal, if existent. A memorandum of agreement\nbetween PNG and Australia dated September 1997 provides for mutual assistance in case of an\noil-spill incident. The document is in accordance with the International Convention on Oil Pollution\nPreparedness, Response, and Cooperation, 1990.\nc. Shipping Registration and Industry\n46. MSB of DOTCA is responsible for ship registration. About 500 vessels are registered in\nPNG. The registration certificate authenticates the main dimensions and tonnage under which the\nship is registered, and these certifications are used by nations whose waters are traveled by the\nvessel and are the basis on which dues are charged. The registry data includes details of vessel\nownership, mortgages, and transfer of interests.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n47. In 1986, the ADB-funded TA, Navigational Aids Improvement Study,7 recommended\nexpanding the navigation aids network by 58 new aids. Funding for these and oil spill equipment\nwith associated training was included under the Transport Infrastructure Development Project\n(footnote 6), with oil spill prevention training carried out in July 2000.\n48. The PNG Maritime School has received assistance from  the Australian  Agency for\nInternational  Development  (AusAID)  for  Maritime  School  Upgrading  Program  until  1998.\nCurricula was prepared, equipment procured, and training provided to upgrade the certification\nlevel to master mariner 2.\n49. Currently, the sector is not benefiting from ongoing external assistance programs. An\nexception to this is a series of workshops conducted by the South Pacific Council, addressing\nregional  issues  including  standards  and  training  certification  of  seafarers,  oil  spills,  safety\nsurveying regulations, search and rescue, and maritime legislation.\n                                                       \n6 Loan 1153/1154-PNG: Transport Infrastructure Development Project, for $69 million, approved on 14 January 1992.\n7 TA 642-PNG: Navigational Aids Improvement Study, for $240,000, approved on 10 December 1984.", "11\nD. Lessons Learned\n50. The navigation aids component of the Transport Infrastructure  Development  project\nincluded the construction of 58 navigation aids, costing about $13.5 million, of which the loan\ncomponent was to finance $8.6 million. While tender documents and prequalification were\ncompleted  in  December  1994,  no  action  was  taken  on  the  component  by  1995  as  no\ncounterpart funds were available, primarily due to severe fiscal constraints. In 1997, K1 million\nwas provided in the development budget to support the component, of which K200,000 was\nprovided by the Government and the balance under the loan. This amount was far less than\nrequired to carry out the project.\n51. In mid-1997, in view of the prolonged funding constraint, the scope of the component\nwas  reduced from 58 navigation  aids  to  32,  and  later  that  year  to  10.  Concurrently,  the\nGovernment  requested  an  extension  of  the  loan  closing  to  December  1998,  partly  to\naccommodate the navigation aids component. MTD engaged a consultant to revalidate the\nprequalified tenderers and to issue a new tender, and it hoped to mobilize construction in\nOctober 1997. However, the consultant\u2019s work was not finalized until the third quarter of 1999\n(i.e., long after the component had been canceled). In September 1997, the entire component\nwas canceled from the loans. Subsequently, the Government requested that ADB consider a\ndedicated loan for the navigation aids. The causes of the failure to utilize funds under the\nTransport Infrastructure Development Project are the following:\n(i)  The fiscal system did not include a formal mechanism for ensuring provision of\ncounterpart  funding  in  a  timely  manner  and  sufficient  amount,  and  the\nGovernment attempted to place responsibility on MTD to provide counterpart\nfunding from the latter\u2019s recurrent budget.\n(ii)  In 1997-1999, a severe delay was incurred in issuing the final tender, due to poor\nperformance  of  the  consultant.  This  disabled  implementation  of  even  the\nreduced-scope project in spite of availability of limited counterpart funds.\n(iii)  Lacking project  implementation  and  management  mechanisms  in  the project\ndesign, limitations of MSB staff, and chronic and unaddressed institutional issues\ncontributed to the poor implementation of the component.\n(iii) The Government continuously failed to provide the counterpart funding to support\nthe project due to a fiscal crisis that dominated the macroeconomic environment\nduring the 1990s.\n52. The new Government of July 1999 has instituted a number of significant policy changes\nand revamped the budget to improve confidence in PNG's macroeconomic management. The\nfollowing actions of the Government have provided a basis to now move forward in this sector\nwith this Project:\n(i) The Government has indicated and demonstrated a high priority for improving\ntransport efficiency and safety in air, land, and sea, and accepted significant aid\nassistance with considerable policy reform content and institutional development\ninitiatives in all three subsectors.", "12\n(ii) The Project includes a detailed implementation strategy to address institutional\ncapacity-building  requirements,  incorporating  a  greater  autonomy  for  the\nExecuting Agency, DOTCA, and hence less dependence on fluctuating allocation\nof fiscal revenues through (a) establishment of a trust account under the control\nof DOTCA into which operating funds will be paid prior to commencement of the\nProject; (b) management strengthening and a thorough reallocation of recurrent\nfunding to support the navigation aids system; (c) strengthening of DOTCA to\ncarry  out  the  respective  duties  including  planning,  acquiring,  and  managing\nresources for operation and investment; and (d) the subsequent creation of an\nautonomous statutory authority for maritime safety.\n(iii) A  comprehensive  project  implementation  mechanism  has  been  prepared  to\nassume responsibility for project implementation and strengthening of DOTCA.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n53. Given the critical importance of economic growth and poverty reduction, transport has\nremained a leading priority in ADB's strategy for PNG. Infrastructure and institutional interventions\nin roads, and sea and  inland  waterways  are essential and prerequisites for the delivery  of\neconomic and social services. They yield suitable economic returns. ADB is helping to restore the\nsystem  of  maritime  navigation  aids  as  part  of  a  broader  and  comprehensive  improvement\nprogram  encompassing  policy  and  institutional  frameworks.  The  Project  incorporates  ADB\u2019s\nconcerns  related  to  community  and  private  sector  participation  and  is  pro-poor  in  nature\ncorresponding to ADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n54. Policy  issues  relevant  to  sector  management  were  identified  and  discussed  with\nGovernment officers. These include (i) sector reorganization and establishment of an MSA, (ii)\nestablishment  of  a  sustainable  source  of  cost  recovery-based  funding  for  maritime  safety\nservices with a direct relationship with the cost of services, (iii) reduction in vandalism and\nimprovement in community relations and the navigation aids, and (iv) establishment of national\ncapability for hydrographic services.\n1. Sector Reorganization\n55. Institutional weakness is the most serious deficiency in the maritime safety system.\nWhile the technical aspects of the system have deteriorated over many years, these relate\nprimarily to institutional constraints. These constraints are evidenced in inadequate funding and\nhuman resources; the consequent lack of planning; limited commercial expertise and customer\nfocus;  weak  institutional  structure  and  unproductive  use  of  human  resources;  landowner\nfrustration  and  chronic  vandalism;  and  lack  of  information  management,  technology,  and\ncorporate culture to promote maritime safety. Due to these institutional weaknesses and lack of\nfunding,  MTD  and  DOTCA  are  unable  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  maritime  and  growth\nobjectives.\n56. Improvement of maritime safety involves a wide range of areas including (i) quality of\nnavigational skills, (ii) vessel seaworthiness and integrity, (iii) updated vessel databases, (iv)\ncapacity to rectify deficiencies immediately, (v) port state control, (vi) enforcement of regulations\naffecting qualification standards of ship crews, (vii) survey of locally registered vessels, (viii)\nreporting of navigational changes and dissemination of updated information to mariners, (ix)", "13\nreporting and investigation of ship casualties, (x) protection of coastal marine environment and\ndisaster remediation, (xi) hydrographic surveys, (xii) search and rescue operations, and (xiii)\nmodern  communications  and  information  technology.  Institutional  restructuring  and\nstrengthening must be undertaken to address development of these functions.\n57. The  Government  is,  through  the  Project,  embarking  on  a  comprehensive  sector\nimprovement program to establish effective maritime safety services. Its objective is to, by 31\nDecember 2000, establish an autonomous MSA that is endowed with a sustained and efficient\ncapacity  to  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  the  rehabilitated  navigation  aids,  and  provide\nmaritime safety services at international standards. This restructuring program is central to\nimproving the management of maritime sector services. The Government will implement the\nprogram as part of its maritime sector strategy. This requires that DOTCA assume financial\nresponsibility for operation and maintenance of the navigation aids system. It needs to have the\nauthority to set and collect charges from users, make independent management decisions on\nthe use of funds, and have management and technical expertise to ensure efficient operations\nand investment, to control expenditure productively, and to plan effectively. To launch the\nprogram, the Government will undertake the initial action program described in Appendix 4. This\ninitial  action  program  includes  (i)  establishment  of  a  trust  account  as  an  interim  financial\ndepository of the user revenues; (ii) disengagement of the Sepura navigation aids vessel and\nthe related human resources from DOTCA, and contracting of transport services from the\nprivate  sector;  (iii)  establishment  of  a  maritime  safety  budget  on  a  cost  recovery  basis\nincorporating out-sourcing principles and maximizing private sector participation; (iv) approval\nand implementation of a oil pollution levy; and (v) submission of legislation to Parliament for\nlegal establishment of the MSA.\n2. The Maritime Safety Authority\n58. Promulgation of the submitted Maritime Safety bill commences a second phase under\nthe sector restructuring program. Principles that govern establishment of the MSA include that\n(i) maritime safety remains a public sector responsibility, (ii) all maritime safety functions be\ncombined into one organization, (iii) this organization be financially self-sufficient with services\nprovided on a user-pay basis, and (iv) as a body corporate, the MSA will have the ability to sue\nand be sued and have the legal capacity to address landowner leases and service contracts\nwithin the legal framework established by the Land Act 1996. The Project will finalize the MSA\nact  and  the  related  amendments  in  affected  acts,  and  prepare,  activate,  and  guide\nimplementation of the MSA.\n59. The legislation establishing the MSA will enable the MSA to raise its own revenue from\nfees and charges, to retain this revenue in accounts in its own name, and to apply these\nrevenues to the maritime safety functions specified in its legislation. The financial objective of\nthe MSA will be to meet all of its own expenses, including any future financing of capital\nrequirements, from its own revenues. The MSA will undertake a range of activities that are\nrelated to the provision of maritime safety, including provision and maintenance of navigation aids,\nvessel surveys and registration, port state control, and management of the national oil  spill\ncontingency plan, and search and rescue operations. Revenues associated with these functions\nwill, consequently, become part of the MSA's income. The Project includes establishment of\nnational hydrographic services, and the cost of maintaining this function over the longer term will\nbe borne by the MSA. The MSA will also coordinate national search and rescue operations. Both\nof these functions generate additional benefits for a wide range of beneficiaries in addition to the\ncommercial  shipping  industry.  Consistent  with  practice  in  other  countries,  additional  funding\nsources would be established accordingly. However, the financial analysis for the MSA has been", "14\ncarried out on the assumption that all costs incurred by the MSA will be met from internally\ngenerated revenues. A financial analysis of the MSA is in Appendix 5.\n3. Sector Funding and Financial Management\na. Budget Allocations\n60. As part of a government department, maritime safety is supported by annual allocations\nfrom the Government\u2019s consolidated budget. Each year, DOTCA submits a budget request to\nthe  national  budget  authority,  the  Department  of  Finance  and  Treasury,  which,  following\nNational  Executive  Committee  and  Parliamentary  approvals,  returns  an  allocation  in  the\nfollowing  year  that  reflects  maritime  safety\u2019s  political  priority  within  overall  Government\nspending.\n61. The Government has recognized that the flow of funds to maintain and manage navigation\naids over the past several years has been minimal. This is evident as  maintenance of the\nnavigation aids has only been feasible when funds become available; most of the repair work is\nleft pending until such time. Subsequently, service delivery performance of the navigation aids is\nnot being reported and is not at a desirable standard. The maritime navigation aids system in\nPNG has deteriorated over the past 10 years to a poor state. Shippers have to now make\nexpensive adjustments to voyage routes and schedules to overcome the shortcomings in the\nnavigation aids system.\nb. Expenditures\n62. The expenditures and allocations for MTD activities fall under activities 101, 102, 103,\nand 104 of the Government\u2019s national budget document corresponding to the Office of Assistant\nDirector,  Maritime  Safety  Regulation  and  Management,  Maritime  Transport  Industry,  and\nHydrographic Services. Due to the consolidated public accounting, a precise breakdown of\nexpenditures cannot be provided. About half of MSB\u2019s annual budget is, however, spent on the\ntwo navigation aids vessels, Kulasi and Sepura amounting to approximately K1.2 million per\nyear. Moreover, under the accounting conventions adopted for the public sector, the recorded\ncost to DOTCA does not include ownership costs\u2014vessel depreciation and the cost of capital.\nThe  inclusion  of  these  costs  would  add  approximately  K1.0  million  per  year  to  the  cost\nestimates. Full crews and provisions are maintained for both vessels, despite the fact that the\nSepura has not been operated since 1996. The Kulasi also has had extended periods of\nidleness in recent years, partly because of maintenance requirements and partly because of\ncash flow problems. During these idle times, DOTCA has met the full cost of crewing and\nprovisioning the vessels, but has derived no value from it. The large expenditure on these\nvessels has been unproductive.\n63. The Sepura is not seaworthy at present. A detailed survey indicated a range of major\ndefects including (i) excessive wear in the main engines, possibly necessitating replacement; (ii)\nexcessive corrosion on deck foundations and winch frames; (iii) significant deficiencies to life-\nsaving equipment; (iv) dysfunctional autopilot, probably requiring total replacement; and (v)\nsubstandard  or  defective  communications  equipment.  Repair  costs  are  estimated  at\napproximately $742,000.\n64. The vessel was built to maintain gas-fired navigation aids and buoys, of which the former\nhave been and the latter are being phased out from PNG\u2019s navigation aids assets. These\nrequirements have now largely disappeared. Further, the Sepura is an expensive vessel to", "15\noperate with fuel costs for a day at sea estimated in excess of K4,000 per day; it has a crew of\n17. More fuel-efficient vessels with smaller crew requirements can satisfy transport needs of the\ntechnical staff to maintain navigation aids. Subsequently, DOTCA has agreed to sell Sepura.\nThe respective redundancy payment for the related staff is a part of the sector reorganization\nprogram and will be treated as counterpart funding under the Project. The utility of Kulasi, the\ntwo 6-meter search and rescue vessels, and the hydrographic surveying vessel under MTD\u2019s\nassets will be investigated and contrasted with the availability of private sector services under\nthe TA for sector reorganization. Appropriate substitute vessels have been  hired from  the\nprivate sector in the past.\n65. Close attention to the cost of vessel services is, therefore, central to efficient provision\nand maintenance of navigation aids. Private sector service contracts need to be developed for\nlogistical support to MSB\u2019s operations under which MSB pays only for the direct and productive\nuse of the vessels, helicopter, or land transport, and will no longer have to provide for their\ngeneral maintenance and full-time crews. An appropriate structured maintenance program for\nnavigation aids, a total of 150 vessel-days per year would be required. With the allowance for\nnecessary  down  time,  this  constitutes  about  50  percent  employment  for  a  single  vessel.\nAdditionally, the community involvement strategy proposed under the Project will reduce the\nneed for technical teams to travel to the sites of navigation aids. It is, thus, unnecessary to\nmaintain two vessels full time to achieve this.\nc. Light Dues\n66. The current structure of navigation aids dues (light dues) under the Merchant Shipping Act\nof 19808 provides for two forms of payment (i) a voyage payment, which covers the ship only for a\nsingle voyage in PNG waters; or (ii) an annual payment, which covers the ship for an unlimited\nnumber of voyages within a 12-month period from the time of payment. All domestic shipowners\npay on an annual basis. Following recent increases, the per voyage charge is K25 per meter, and\nthe annual fee K60 per meter. The navigation aids fees are given in Appendix 6.\n67. Until 1 April 2000, the navigation aids dues for overseas vessels calling at PNG ports were\ncollected by the PNG Harbours Board (PNGHB), which retained 1 percent of the revenue as a\nservice charge. PNGHB withheld a fee of K16,652 in 1997. Long delays have frequently been\nexperienced in the payment of fees collected by PNGHB: payments for the last two quarters of\n1998 were received in April and May of 2000 respectively, and no payments have yet been made\nfor any dues collected in 1999 or 2000.\n68. MSB collects navigation aids dues from coastal and international vessels. The revenues\nare returned to the consolidated fiscal revenues. There has been no connection between the\ncollected fees and MSB\u2019s annual budget allocation. The procedures for collections have not been\nrigorous and arrears are substantial and growing.9\n 69. The Government recognizes that the collection procedures are fragmented and ineffective,\nthat the level of arrears is unacceptable, and that there is likely a substantial volume of unbilled\nshipping. Consequently, DOTCA discontinued PNGHB\u2019s collection service effective 1 April 2000.\nDOTCA also increased light dues by an average of 75 percent effective 1 January 2000 to K60\n                                                       \n8 The annual contribution rate under the Merchant Shipping (Navigational Aids) (Amendment) regulation 1998 of\nPNG.\n9 DOTCA\u2019s authority to detain vessels for nonpayment of dues or other reasons under the Merchant Shipping Act is\nweak.", "16\nper meter for the annual fee and K25 per meter per visit. Regional officers of DOTCA have been\nformally appointed to collect the dues from shipowners.\n70. Procedures for the collection of navigation aids  dues  from  overseas  vessels  require\nimprovement. A total of K600,575 was collected between 1 April and 8 June 2000 in navigation\naids dues. Under the cash-based accounting of DOTCA, this comprised payments from PNGHB\nfor revenues collected during the second half of 1998, receipts from vessels visiting the Kumul oil\nterminal, and actual collections from overseas vessels during the period. The latter corresponded\nto K122,000, or to a quarterly collection of K160,000. This compares poorly with the average\nPNGHB collections of K319,818 over a similar period. The comparison is even less favorable\nwhen the recent increase in dues is taken into account.\n71. The collection process relies on self-reporting by the ship\u2019s agent. Upon payment of the\nnavigation aids dues, DOTCA issues a certificate for the ships. No effective process is in place for\nchecking that a vessel calling at a PNG port has a valid navigation aids dues certificate nor is the\nprocess practical for imposing sanctions on a vessel not in possession of a valid certificate.\nFurther, in the absence of an arrangement between the Department of Customs and DOTCA,\nphysical inspection for a valid navigation aids dues certificate is cumbersome for DOTCA officers.\nWhile DOTCA actively seeks information from PNGHB and the ships\u2019 agents on the vessels\ncalling at PNG ports. The information is often incomplete and provided on an ad hoc basis.\nDOTCA\u2019s navigation aids dues\u2019 records are kept manually in a logbook. Finally, for domestic\nvessels the problem lies in enforcement of the payments as some shipowners regard the charge\nunreasonable as the navigational services have been poor.\n72. Under the sector reorganization component of the Project, DOTCA will (i) require coastal\nshippers to pay an annual fee in conjunction with the renewal of their vessel license, and (ii)\nrequire the international ship operators to pay the fee prior to clearing customs at their first landing\nin PNG in a 12-month period. DOTCA will request that customs check for a DOTCA receipt for\nsuch payment prior to clearing vessels for sailing. The effectiveness of the collection procedure\nwill be strengthened under TA for sector reorganization.\nd. Oil Spill Levy\n73. PNG is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from ships.\nTo  discharge  its  obligations  under  this  convention,  in  1996  the  Government  adopted  the\nNational Oil Spill Contingency Plan. MSB is the coordinating agency for the plan. Under the\nplan, an inventory of oil spill equipment was procured and a recurrent training plan is being\ndeveloped under the Transport Infrastructure Development Project (footnote 6).\n74. However, there is no clear strategy for funding the facilities and activities to maintain an\nadequate  response  capability.  To  ensure  cost-center-based  financial  sustainability  of  the\nplanned MSA, DOTCA has prepared a draft policy paper on the introduction of a protection of\nthe sea shipping levy for approval of the National Executive Council (NEC). It recommends that\nthe national plan be funded on a polluter-pays basis, using a levy on ships most likely to be\ninvolved in an oil spill incident.\n75. The strategy proposes a charge per net registered ton (nrt) to be levied on all vessels\nwith a registered length exceeding 24 meters and carrying a minimum of 10 tons of oil on board\nat any time during a calendar quarter. While under this strategy the levy will be applied to most\nforeign commercial shipping visiting PNG, its impact on domestic craft is less clear. Most\nregistered craft are less than 24 meters in length, and no data is available on the number of", "17\nvessels that can carry more than 10 tons of fuel. The proposed levy is K0.30 ($0.1) per nrt per\nquarter. The basis of the levy closely corresponds with the exposure of the vessel to possible\nincident in PNG waters. While the effective discount on navigation aids offered to regular callers\nis currently high, the benefit derived from the provision of the navigation safety function relates\ndirectly to the number of calls in PNG, and thus, the more approaches negotiated in PNG\nwaters, the greater the level of exposure to oil spill risk.\n76. The revenues are estimated to yield about K1.9 million annually against the estimated\ncosts of maintaining oil spill preparedness under the plan at about K1.8 million. Thus, the\nrevenues from the levy would recover the full cost of the plan. The levy should generate a small\nsurplus by the time the Project is completed. This surplus would be sufficient to cover about half\nof the recurrent costs of hydrographic operations. Analysis of the revenues is in Appendix 7.\ne. Establishing a Trust Account\n77. Inadequate funding is the chief reason for the poor performance of MSB in promoting\nmaritime safety. Additionally, experience with the Transport Infrastructure Development Project\n(footnote 6) regarding counterpart funding reflects a low priority assigned to the sector under the\nnational Government\u2019s development planning. The Government gives priority to such funding to\ngain confidence in the navigation aids system and implementation of the Project. Consequently,\nestablishment  of  a  trust  account  under  the  Public  Finances  Management  Act  of  1995  is\nnecessary as an interim measure to establish a link between the light dues\u2014a user charge for\nthe navigation aids and the performance of the navigation aids system. Establishment of the\ntrust account needs to precede the promulgation of legislation for the statutory authority for\nmaritime safety to ensure financial viability of the new authority.\n78. A trust account will allow MSB to expend the collected revenues directly in support of\nnavigation and maritime safety services. The  Government  has agreed  to  establish a  trust\naccount as a priority prior to the commencement of the Project. The trust fund is required to\nensure (i) execution of the Government\u2019s policy to prioritize development of maritime transport,\n(ii) adequate financing of operation and maintenance of the newly established navigation aids\nsystem, and (iii) increased confidence of  the  shipping  industry,  which  is paying  increased\nnavigation aids fees for the improved services.\n79. DOTCA will appoint a financial manager and a budget administrative officer for MSB to\nmanage and administer the trust account, develop a new collection methodology, and establish\ntransparent  revenue  and  expenditure  reporting.  This  is  also  a  step  in  establishing  an\nindependent financial management capable of migrating to the planned statutory authority for\nmaritime safety. The incumbents will be qualified in accounting, financial management, and\ncomputerized database and information management systems.\n80. DOTCA  will,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  ensure  stakeholder\nconsultation, provide quarterly reports on the collection and expenditures for the Navigation Aids\nAdvisory Committee (NAAC) in addition to its internal reporting on the trust account. The trust\naccount will be maintained as an interim financial management instrument as a transitional step\nunder the sector reorganization program to establish a statutory authority for maritime safety.", "18\n4. Community Engagement Program\n81. The effects of continued vandalism is the primary cause for repair requirements of the\nnavigation aids. Over one third of the network is inoperable exclusively because of vandalism.\nVandalism is motivated by both landowner dissatisfaction and theft. The Project incorporates\nmainstreaming of a community engagement program that includes (i) implementation of service\nagreements  with  community  core  groups  comprising  representatives  from  church,  women\u2019s\ngroups, youth organizations, affected landowners, and elected village officials and leaders; (ii)\ndevelopment of small routine maintenance contracts; (iii) a public information campaign on the\nimportance of navigation aids; and (iv) strengthening of law enforcement. Details of the program\nwill be prepared in consultation with the provincial administrations. Under the program, core\ncommunity groups will be identified. These will have credibility and experience in social program\ndelivery at the grassroots level, and will be able to contribute their well-developed networks and\ninsights to the program.\n5. Hydrographic Capacity\n82. As with other coastal nations, PNG depends heavily on the marine environment and the\nresources of its coastal waters. An estimated 50 percent of the population lives on the coastline\nadjacent  to  these  waters,  with  direct  reliance  on  the  near-shore  marine  environment  for\nsubsistence fishing and food, transport, and waste disposal, particularly in rural and regional\nareas. At the national level, PNG\u2019s economic resources are densely concentrated in coastal\nregions  with  major  economic  dependencies  linked  to  marine  resources  including  tourism,\ncommercial fisheries and aquaculture, international and domestic shipping, port development, and\nhydrocarbon and mineral exploration. Combined with the fragile nature of the coral reef and other\necosystems in these waters, it is vital that these marine resources be managed in a sustainable\nway to support the subsistence needs of regional communities and for sustained economic growth\ninto the future.\n83. While the land-mass is relatively well mapped with many geographic information system\n(GIS) data sets available to support policy and decision making for land-based resources and\nenvironmental management issues, 95 percent of the internal waters of rivers and coastal waters\nremain unsurveyed at modern standards. PNG currently lacks the basic charts, coral reef maps,\nand data sets that are required for effective management of these critical resources. The Project\naims to address this by providing the basic infrastructure, database, data, and training as a\nfoundation for development and implementation of a national integrated coastal marine resource\nmanagement program.\n84. PNG does not have a hydrographic and mapping function. The Royal Australian Navy has\nbeen carrying out hydrographic survey and chart compilation of PNG\u2019s waters. These have been\nrecompiled from older charts of different publishers into nautical charts. The current charts that\ncover the PNG waters originate in Australia and United Kingdom. Hydrographic basic data is\ngenerally from before 1944. Under the Project, the PNG Hydrographic Unit of MSB would emerge\nwith the capacity to undertake hydrographic surveys and marine resource management. The\noutputs  include  IHO-standard  navigational  charts;  electronic  navigational  charts;  nautical\npublications; and delimitation of PNG\u2019s territorial sea, contiguous zone, and exclusive economic\nzone to discharge its legal obligations under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea\n(UNCLOS 82).", "19\n85. Additional  output  is  an  integrated  coastal  marine  resource  management  program\nsupported by a fully operational marine resource database with capacity to maintain and use the\ndatabase and GIS. The program would network DOTCA with the University of Papua New\nGuinea, University of Technology in Lea and Port Moresby, and Maritime College in Madang,\nand  impact  on  key  government  and  nongovernment  stakeholder  agencies  responsible  for\nmanaging coastal marine resources in PNG. It will have a direct impact on the population, in\nparticular, regional communities through more efficient maritime transport, reduction of pollution\nfrom  vessel  grounding,  improvement  in  tourism  planning  and  operations,  better  fisheries\nmanagement, and enhanced waste management planning, mineral exploration, and overall\nsustainable  management  of  PNG\u2019s  coral  reef  environment.  The  benefits  of  hydrographic\ncapacity include (i) safer and more efficient marine transport, (ii) enhanced management and\ncontrol of fisheries and aquaculture, (iii)  improved  marine environmental  management  and\nenvironmental impact assessment, (iv) enhanced opportunities for mineral and hydrocarbon\nexploration, (v) economic development of remote and regional communities, and (vi) improved\ncapacity for tourism development and management.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n86. About half of the population of PNG live in the coastal provinces, most of them in\nconditions of extreme isolation, deprived of basic social services and economic opportunities.\nThe delivery of traded food items, education, and health services all depend heavily on ocean\ntransport. Integration of the coastal communities with the national economy, on which income\nand employment opportunities in the coastal communities ultimately depend, requires great\nimprovement of the frequency, reliability, and safety of coastal maritime transport by commercial\nvessels and smaller private craft. A major constraint to  this  development  is  the  poor and\ndeteriorating level of navigational services provided by the public sector in all coastal areas.\n87. Provision of navigation aids and other maritime safety services is a public good. Failure\nto provide the services has been due to (i) a weak institutional environment and (ii) chronic\nlandowner frustration resulting in widespread vandalism against navigation aids installations.\nVandalism is primarily a social problem, and secondarily a financial and technical problem.\nLandowner communities must understand the role of navigation aids in their communities and in\nPNG, and must support the network. They are willing to do this provided a sustained financial\nand social commitment to their needs is guaranteed by the authority managing the system of\nnavigational services.\n88. The coastal communities are frustrated with continuing impoverishment and lack of\nopportunity,  while  the  urban  segment  of  the  economy  grows  in  pace  with  the  increasing\nextraction of minerals, petroleum, and timber resources. The isolation of coastal communities\nfrom the economy represents a serious economic loss and has become a social challenge. This\nhas resulted in a breakdown of peace and security conditions across the country, alienation of\ndisadvantaged communities, and economic disintegration.\n89. Institutional weakness is the most serious deficiency in the maritime safety system. To\nimprove  maritime  safety  services,  the  Government  will,  through  the  Project,  embark  on  a\ncomprehensive sector improvement program to establish effective maritime safety services. Its\nobjective is to establish an autonomous MSA that is endowed with a sustained and efficient\ncapacity to manage, operate, and maintain the rehabilitated navigation aids, and provide maritime\nsafety services at international standards. This restructuring program  is central to improving", "20\nmanagement of maritime sector services; the Government will implement the program as part of\nits maritime sector strategy.\n90. The  Project  supports  maritime  transport  in  PNG  to  contribute  its  full  potential  to\neconomic growth and development of the country. The Project is designed to (i) restructure\nmaritime sector management to enable provision of sustainable and effective maritime safety\nservices; (ii) lower the cost of maritime transport, and improve safety of cargo and passenger\nmovements into and between urban areas; (iii) improve the distribution of goods and services,\nand support the development of markets; and (iv) generate income opportunities in remote and\nimpoverished coastal rural areas.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n91. The objective of the Project is to contribute to economic growth by releasing the potential\nof the maritime transport sector. Specifically, the Project supports (i) geographic integration of\nthe country, including remote populations; (ii) distribution of goods and services to the rural\npoor; (iii) improved affordability, reliability, and safety in travel along the coastal areas; and (iv)\ndevelopment of local markets, and increasing efficiency of trade with domestic and international\ncenters. The Project will significantly raise the confidence of mariners navigating in PNG coastal\nwaters and enable them to provide improved transportation services at lower cost and lower\nrisk.\n92. The Project will (i) restructure sector management by implementing an autonomous\nMSA, (ii) reconstruct the network of the navigation aids to an acceptable international maritime\nstandard, (iii) establish a self-reliant hydrographic service, and (iv) institutionalize sustainable\noperation and maintenance of the navigation aids, and (v) implement community programs that\ncontribute to effective network maintenance. The scope of the Project includes the following\ncomponents: sector reorganization; construction of new channels, restoration and rehabilitation\nof navigation aids;  provision  of  equipment for  navigation  aids;  development  of  community\nengagement program; establishment of hydrographic infrastructure and management capacity;\nprovision of training; and project management.\nC. Technical Justification\n1. Sector Restructuring\n93. The Government has embarked on a comprehensive sector restructuring program by\nintroducing a 75 percent increase in the navigation aids tariffs and assigning revenue collection\nas a DOTCA responsibility. Sector reforms will be implemented with the support of the Project.\nThis includes the following reform measures:\n(i)  Establish a maritime safety trust account. The account will be an interim financial\ndepository of the user revenues including the navigation aids dues and the oil\npollution levy. The trust account will be established by the Minister of Finance\nunder the Public Finances Management Act by 15 August 2000. The account will\nensure  that  all  physical  investments  receive  adequate  operation  and\nmaintenance funding. It will establish confidence in the financial sustainability of\nthe  sector  and  the  planned  MSA.  Establishment  of  the  trust  account  is  a\ncondition of loan effectiveness.", "21\n(ii)  Submit an oil pollution levy to NEC. Approval is anticipated in the very near future\n(with submission to the Parliament a condition of loan effectiveness) to ensure\nthe financial  sustainability  of  sector operation,  and  in particular,  to establish\nPNG\u2019s capacity to address any possible oil spill situations in accordance with its\ninternational obligations as an oil exporting country.\n(iii)  Sell the Sepura navigation aids vessel. The Government will make the separation\npayments for the involved staff in accordance with its policies for public service\nstaff. The logistics services will be analyzed to establish transport services for\nsector operations on a least-cost basis.\n(iv)  Submit an MSA bill to NEC and Parliament. This will  establish  autonomous\nsector management under the auspices of a self-financial authority with its own\nlegal entity and remuneration schemes. This process  involves  legal drafting,\ninterdepartmental circulation, NEC approval, and three readings in Parliament.\nEstablishment of the MSA will leave regulatory and policy functions with DOTCA\nand assume a role for execution of a regulatory regime.\n(v)  Establish a community engagement program. This will ensure integrity of the\nnavigation aids network and provision of up-to-date maritime navigational and\nsafety services (para. 98).\n94. The promulgation of the submitted MSA bill will commence a second phase under the\nsector restructuring program. The component supports establishment of the MSA by finalizing\nthe  MSA  act  and  the  related  amendments  in  affected  acts.  The  component  will  prepare,\nactivate, and guide implementation of the MSA.\n95. International consulting services are required from an international firm to support (i)\nsector  restructuring  to  ensure  effective  project  management,  (ii)  preparation  of  the  legal\nframework  for  establishing  and  implementing  the  MSA,  (iii)  regularization  of  community\nparticipation in MSA operations, and (iv) provision of a staff recruitment and training program\ncovering managerial, technical, and community engagement for improved operation, promotion,\nand maintenance of MSA's maritime safety functions. About 30 person-months of consulting\nservices are required in the fields of maritime sector corporate planning, maritime economics,\nfinancial  management  and  planning,  institutional  restructuring,  corporate  planning,  financial\nmanagement, administration and control functions, human resources management and training,\noutsourcing and contract management, and implementation of community-based development.\nDOTCA will select consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nThese consulting services will be funded by a grant from AusAID. Outline terms of reference are\ngiven in Appendix 8.\n2. New Channels, Restoration, and Rehabilitation of Navigation Aids\n96. Rehabilitation and establishment of new navigation aids will be carried out over five\nyears commencing with design work and implementation of a community engagement program.\nThe work under the Project lays the foundation for the recurrent maintenance program. The\nselected technical solution incorporates (i) minimum maintenance structures, (ii) helicopter-\nbased inspection of navigation aids in sites difficult to reach, (iii) improved design to prevent\nvandalism, (iv) restoration of aids with appropriate range and simplicity, and (v) standardization\nof lighting and power supply equipment. The program has been prepared following a detailed\naudit  of  PNG\u2019s  network  of  navigation  aids  and  includes  repair  of  104  navigation  aids,", "22\nreplacement of 45 navigation aids, and construction of 45 new navigation aids. A five-year\nmaintenance program commencing at Project completion will link with the rehabilitation and\nconstruction  program.  The  program  will  be  implemented  through  (i)  external  contracts  for\nconstruction of new navigation aid structures, (ii) rehabilitation projects managed and executed\nby MSB, and (iii) implementation of a sector reorganization plan. The three-pronged approach\nhas been designed to allow for maximum on-the-job training opportunities during  the field\nprogram and benefits to the community. A summary of the program is in Appendix 9.\n3. Equipment for Maintenance of Navigation Aids\n97. The Project requires procurement of navigation aids lighting, power supply, and tower\nstructure equipment. These include lanterns, radar transponders, batteries, battery charges,\nsolar  panels,  and  glass  reinforced  plastic  and  lattice  tower  structures.  This  equipment,\nparticularly the solar panels, and lanterns have a long life of 15 years provided appropriate\nmaintenance is carried out. A detailed procurement program will be established under the\nProject for timely provision of equipment inputs to the five-year restoration program.\n4. Community Engagement Program\n98. The community engagement program aims to secure active community participation in\nmaintaining and protecting navigation aids installations. This will include (i) light maintenance\nservices, i.e., washing of solar panels and lanterns, painting of structures, and grass cutting; (ii)\nprevention of vandalism attacks against installations; and (iii) ongoing monitoring and reporting\nto MSB on the status of the installation in their community. These services will be provided\nunder fee-based service contracts with the core groups. The contracts will be standardized to\nthe extent possible with the support of the community development specialist in conjunction with\nprovincial,  district,  and  local  governments.  The  program  focuses  on  about  200  coastal\ncommunities  in  the  14  maritime  provinces  and  the  national  capital  district.  The  following\nmechanisms will be implemented under the component:\n(i) Core groups will be formed to ensure an inclusive participatory mechanism at the\nvillage level. Groups will compose landowners, village leaders, youth, women's\norganizations, etc.\n(ii) Routine  maintenance  service  agreements  with  the  core  group  will  include\npainting,  vegetation  control,  protection  of  installations  against  vandalism  by\npolicing and active community public information, and monitoring and reporting of\nstatus to MSB. The Project will explore provision of on-the-job training to the core\ngroups  to  undertake  more  advanced  routine  maintenance  activities  such  as\nchanging of bulbs and fuses, and checking battery liquid levels. Increasing the\ntransfer of maintenance activities will reduce MSB\u2019s and later the MSA\u2019s cost of\ntravel and transport hire (helicopter, maritime, and land transport), build broad-\nbased community support for the navigation aids, and generate employment.\n(iii) Land lease conditions and payments required for new aids and of the backlog will\nbe  reviewed,  service  agreements  with  landowners  and  host  villages  will  be\nprepared to provide for regular payment for land access and services.\n(iv) Training and education will strengthen the core groups' capacity to provide public\ninformation functions so that they can disseminate information to  the  village\nresidents on the importance and safety functions of the navigation aids.", "23\n(v) Public  information  and  awareness  campaign  at  the  community  level  will  be\nprovided by the core groups, and include community meetings, focused group\ndiscussions,  and  workshops  to  increase  awareness  of  the  importance  of\nnavigation aids structures. Information materials will include effective posters,\ncomics, and other materials.\n5. Establishment of Hydrographic Infrastructure and Management Capacity\n99. Hydrographic charts are primary navigation tools. Accurate charts allow vessels to use\nthe differential global positioning system (DGPS). Inaccurate charts do not allow the use of\nDGPS, and consequently prohibit night navigation in some areas, lead to increased risk of reef\ncollisions, require larger quantities of expensive navigation aids, and prohibit comprehensive\nunderstanding of national marine resources.\n100. The Project will establish basic infrastructure and equipment, institutional framework\nwithin the MSA with joint programs with the PNG defense forces, and management capacity to\nsupport implementation of a hydrographic unit. The unit will implement a  marine  resource\ndatabase  to  support  decision  making  on  marine  resource  management,  an  interagency\ninstitutional framework to support integrated usage of the data by all stakeholders, sustainable\nupgrading of skills in GIS database management, application of IHO standards in the production\nof navigational charts for the rivers and coastal waters, identification of baseline information to\nconfirm  PNG\u2019s  territorial  waters  and  exclusive  economic  zone  under  the  United  Nations\nConvention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS 82), and promotion of data availability for all\nrelevant users.\n6. Training\n101. The  Project  will  deliver  significant  skills  upgrading  to  improve  the  managerial  and\ntechnical capacity of MSB. Training programs will be developed and executed using transfer of\ntechnology, on-the-job training, and formal internal courses. Training is also required for the\nestablishment of a self-reliant hydrographic service and includes basic training in navigation,\ngeodesy,  DGPS,  database  management  and  manipulation,  digital  map  production,  and\noperation of the specific system and equipment installed under the Project.\n102. For the development of hydrographic data management capacity, technology transfer\nwill build capacity to establish surveying methodologies using DGPS techniques, multibeam,\nprocessing bathymetric and digital data, and use and management of chart production software.\nOn-the-job training will be provided by a geodesy, operation of DGPS and navigation systems,\noceanography  and  tidal  environment  monitoring  systems,  and  establishing  routines  for\noperation and maintenance of these systems, database management and quality assurance\nroutines, accurate placing of the coastline, cartography, and chart production. In addition on-the-\njob training will be provided for the hydrographic services through seminars and courses using\nthe Maritime College in Madang, University of Technology in Lae, and the University of Papua\nNew Guinea. The Project consultants, in conjunction with these institutions, will design and\nexecute relevant training programs.\n7. Support to Project Management\n103. Consulting  services  are  required  from  an  international  firm  to  (i)  support  project\nimplementation, (ii) establish a sustainable maintenance operation for the navigation aids, (iii)", "24\nestablish a self-reliant hydrographic service, and (iv) support sector reorganization. This support\nwill concurrently strengthen MTD\u2019s technical, managerial, and financial capacity as a maritime\nsafety service provider capable of transforming MTD into an autonomous authority.  These\nservices include extensive on-the-job training, and domestic and external formal training under the\nProject. About 120 person-months are required in the fields of (i) engineering, construction,\nrehabilitation, upgrading, and maintenance of navigation aids; (ii) navigation; (iii) financial and\nproject management; (iv) contract documentation and supervision; (v)  quality  control,  work\nmeasurement, and reporting; (vi) project and maintenance management, implementation of\nworks, community development, and training; (vii) hydrographics, hydrographic data processing\nand database management, oceanography, cartograhpy, and geodesy; (viii) corporate planning;\n(ix)  maritime  economics;  (x) financial  and  managerial planning; and  (xi)  human  resources\nplanning. The Project will also cover the costs of any external auditing that may be required.\nThese consulting services will be financed from the loan funds. DOTCA will select appropriately\nqualified  counterparts  for  each  consultant  for  project  implementation.  DOTCA  will  select\nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of\nreference are given in Appendix 10.\nD. Cost Estimates\n104. The total cost of the Project, including taxes, duties, and interest during construction is\nestimated  at  $30.12  million, of  which  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  including  interest  during\nconstruction, is about $22.58 million (75 percent) and the local currency cost (including taxes\nand duties) is about $7.54 million (25 percent). The estimated costs of the various project\ncomponents are summarized in Table 1.

Financing Plan\n105. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $20.60 million equivalent, representing about\n68 percent of the total cost of the Project. This loan would finance all the foreign exchange costs\nof the equipment, establishment of hydrographic services, training, and consulting services, and\nmost of the foreign exchange costs of the restoration of the navigation aids (72 percent). ADB\u2019s\nincreased cost  sharing  of  the Project  is  justified as  (i)  the  loan finances only the foreign\nexchange costs, and (ii) the Government is implementing a constrained fiscal policy under a\nstructural adjustment program with the International Monetary Fund.\n106. PNG will be the Borrower. The proposed loan will be made from ADB's ordinary capital\nresources and be denominated in US dollars. It will have an amortization period of 25 years,\nincluding a grace period of 5 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB's pool-\nbased variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent, and a\nfront-end fee of 1 percent of the total loan amount.\n107. The  Government  is  securing  cofinancing  from  AusAID  for  $0.8  million  to  finance\nconsulting services for sector reorganization. Once such cofinancing is formally available, ADB\nwill administer these funds under an existing Channel Financing Agreement between ADB and\nAusAID in accordance with ADB guidelines; the corresponding loan amount will be canceled or\nreallocated in accordance with relevant ADB procedures. Financing of the project costs is\nshown in Table 1.\n108. The balance of the project costs will be met from the Government\u2019s own resources. In\nthe special assurance to be incorporated in the loan agreement, the Government has committed\nto financing these costs at a minimum of K5.5 million per annum over the five-year project\nimplementation period from 2001 to 2005 and at K1.0 million in the initial year of 2000.\nF. The Executing Agency\n109. The Executing Agency for the Project is DOTCA with its secretary responsible for the\nproject activities as the project director. The Government will appoint a suitably qualified project\nmanager. The project manager will be qualified to provide training and become an instrumental\nstaff  member  in  the  planned  statutory  authority  for  maritime  safety.  MSB  will  be  the\nImplementing Agency for Phase I of the reorganization plan and will handle daily activities of the\nproject.  Activities  include  procurement,  administration,  monitoring,  and  reporting  on  the\nconsulting services, works, and equipment. Contract supervision and quality control will be done\nby MSB assisted by international consultants.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Steering Committee\n110. Since 1999, NAAC, established under the Merchant Shipping Act, has convened five\nmeetings, which were chaired by DOTCA. Its membership comprises representatives of the\nDepartment of National Planning and Monitoring, Department of Finance and Treasury, PNG\nHarbours  Board, and  shipping companies as  per  the  Merchant  Shipping  Act  1980. While\nDOTCA chairs NAAC, a secretary will be selected from the private sector membership of NAAC.\n111. The Government has established NAAC as the project steering committee, which will\ninclude  a  representative  of  the  community  participants  under  the  Project.  The  steering", "26\ncommittee provides for broader representation of stakeholders in project implementation. It will\nmeet  every  quarter  to  discuss  and  resolve  emerging  issues  in  project  implementation,\nprocurement, land acquisition, the community engagement program, prioritization of works and\nlocation of new navigation aids, hydrographic surveys, and support to the Project. It will also\nreview the quarterly project reports for submission to ADB and issue its opinion on these reports\nto the Government and ADB. The steering committee will (i) monitor, guide, and facilitate project\nimplementation and progress; (ii) identify and mitigate constraints to project implementation and\nadvise the project manager on action to be taken; (iii) facilitate community support programs;\n(iv) participate in the bid evaluation committees as an observing member and participate in the\npublic bid openings under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement; and (v) review the reports on the\nuse of the navigation aids trust account.\n2. Procurement\n112. Procurement  will  be  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  and\ninternational shopping, and use DOTCA\u2019s own technical services (force account) in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. All new navigation aids and major restoration works will\nbe procured under ICB. All civil works contracts equal to or greater than $1.0 million equivalent in\nvalue and contracts for procurement of goods (equipment) greater than $500,000 in value will be\nprocured under ICB. ICB contracts will be encouraged to include joint-venture arrangements with\nlocal contractors. Contracts below these values may be procured using international shopping.\nPrequalification  of  contractors  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on\nProcurement. Contractors will be eligible to tender for one or more of the contract packages within\ntheir respective bid capacities. ADB approval prior to the award of contracts will be required for\nall ICB contracts. Periodic maintenance activities and reequipping of navigation aids will be\ncarried out by DOTCA. ADB will not be committed to financing contracts awarded without prior\nADB  approval.  Designs  and  tender  documentation  will  be  prepared  by  the  Project\nimplementation consultants.\n113. The Government has requested advance recruitment action for consulting services to\nexpedite  sector  restructuring.  These  services  will  be  funded  by  a  grant  from  AusAID\nadministered  by  ADB  through  an  existing  channel  financing  agreement  between  the  two\nfinancing  agencies.  The  recruitment  action  entails  DOTCA  proceeding  with  the  consultant\nselection process immediately after the Appraisal Mission and submitting tender documents to\nADB for its approval. Contract award will be subject to loan effectivity. ADB will not be liable for\nany expense accrued under the contract if the ADB loan is not declared effective. Tentative\nprocurement packages are in Appendix 12.\n3. Implementation Schedule\n114. The Project will be implemented over five and half years including the first six months of\norganizational  and  preconstruction  activities  and  five  years  of  restoration  activities.\nEstablishment  and  implementation  of  a  community  engagement  program,  preparation  of\ndesigns, prequalification of contractors, and tendering will be carried out from loan effectiveness\nin 2000 until mid-2001. Establishment of the hydrographic system will begin with personnel\nrecruitment, and procurement and installation of equipment in the first quarter of 2001, and\ncontinue with survey activity from early 2001 to 2005. Production of hydrographic charts will\nbegin in the fourth quarter of 2001. Training will be integrated with these activities.", "27\n115. Sector reorganization began in April 2000 with the establishment of cost recovery, with\nDOTCA collecting increased navigation aids dues. The navigation aids trust account will be\nestablished during the third quarter of 2000. Reorganization will commence with mobilization of\nthe consultants in the third quarter of 2000 under advanced procurement action, rationalization\nof MSB resources, and establishment of a legal framework for the MSA. Upon promulgation of\nthe MSA bill, the MSA will be implemented commencing with the establishment of corporate\nplans, staffing, managerial and operational procedures in early 2001. A technical review of the\nProject will be conducted jointly with the Government two years after loan effectivity. The\nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 13.\n4. Reporting\n116. DOTCA will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports concerning financial aspects,\nprocurement  of  equipment  and  services,  the  design  and  preconstruction  activities,  and\nconstruction of all civil works included in the Project. Project implementation consultants will\nassist in this reporting responsibility. DOTCA will furnish ADB with the proposed annual MTD\nbudget at a date prior to its submission to the Government. To facilitate postevaluation of the\nProject, the Government will provide ADB, within three months of physical completion of the\nProject, a completion report that will comprehensively cover details of project implementation,\ncosts  and  potential  benefits,  and  any  other  information  that  may  be  requested  by  ADB\nconcerning  the  Project.  The  Government  will  provide  quarterly  and annual  reports  on  the\nnavigation aids trust account, activities, and expenditures, and on progress in taking appropriate\naction to approve  and  implement the  sector  reorganization  initiatives, transport  policy  and\nregulations, and organizational changes and progress achieved in strengthening DOTCA.\n  5. Accounts\n117. DOTCA will establish and maintain separate accounts for all expenditures under the\nProject. It will furnish ADB with accounts and related financial statements reflecting the accounts\nfor each project-related contract. These financial statements will be audited using international\nauditing guidelines by auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements together\nwith the auditor\u2019s report will be forwarded to ADB within nine months of the end of each related\nfiscal  year.  The  chief project  management  consultant  will  keep detailed  costing of project\ncomponents and help DOTCA report, as required.\n118. The accounting capability of the Department of Transport and Civil Aviation currently\nresides within the Finance Branch of the Finance and Administration Division, which has 16. Of\nthese, two positions are vacant. Three new positions are being established. Three levels of\naccounting qualification are recognized in the PNG public service: (i) certificate-level qualification,\nwhich requires one year of postsecondary formal training; (ii) diploma level, which requires two\nyears of university training; and (iii) degree level, which requires two years in addition to the\ndiploma-level course, for a total of four years tertiary training. Two officers within the DOTCA\nFinance  Branch  have  degree-level  qualifications.  Both  of  these  officers  are  also  accredited\nmembers of the professional body of the accounting profession in PNG. The assistant director of\nfinance, appointed to manage the trust account and the Project's financial activities, is one of\nthese two officers. Most staff are familiar with computerized accounting operations through their\nexposure to the Government\u2019s central accounting system.\n119. The accounts of Government departments in PNG continue to be run on a cash basis.\nThe focus of accounting activity in the DOTCA Finance Branch is on financial accounting:\nensuring that monies received and expended are properly accounted for, that cash budgets are", "28\nproperly prepared, and that the status of expenditures and receipts against budget is known.\nUnder the sector restructuring program, support  will be required to focus on management\naccounting  including  service  costing,  pricing,  financial  planning,  and  development  and\nmonitoring financial performance indicators. The overall assessment indicates that the staff of\nthe Finance Branch, supported by a consultant, are able to perform the financial management\ntasks  required  to  administer  the  Project,  but  needs  improvement  to  conduct  financing\nresponsibilities of the MSA.\n6. Disbursement Procedures\n120. Under the proposed implementation arrangements, the Government will allocate annual\ncounterpart funds for expenditures for five consecutive years. The disbursement will be made\nfor  eligible  expenditures  under  ADB's  Disbursement  Guidelines  following  ADB's  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. Under the proposed implementation arrangements, all applications for\nwithdrawal for the disbursement of the loan funds for eligible expenditures will be carried out by\ndirect  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures,  and  through  an  imprest  account.  Specific\nrequirements  for  disbursement  procedures  under  the  Project  were  prepared  during  the\nAppraisal Mission. The initial amount of the imprest account will be $300,000 and maximum\npayment $50,000.\n7. Technical Review\n121. In addition to a schedule of biannual regular review meetings to monitor the progress of\nthe Project, a technical review will be carried out two years after the Project has become\neffective. The review will focus on determining the need for deviations from the original project\ndesign or implementation arrangements, cost overruns, loan reallocations, and other factors, if\nany, including assumptions and risks that might constrain satisfactory project implementation\nand achievement of development objectives.\n8. Project Performance Evaluation\n122. DOTCA will compile and analyze data to facilitate project performance monitoring and\nevaluation. It will forward this information to ADB and the Government in accordance with an\nagreed schedule of performance measurement indicators. A proposed set of measures were\nagreed  during the  Appraisal  Mission.  These  measures aim  to  assess  the  macroeconomic\nimpact of the Project, and include three major groups of activities: (i) benchmarking, to provide\nDOTCA and the sector management with objective reference points for impact evaluation that\nrespond  to  the  needs  of  the  users  of  navigation  aids  and  shipping  industry;  (ii)  benefit\nmonitoring, to ensure that the project benefits indeed accrue to the users; and (iii) postproject\nperformance  and  benefit  evaluation,  to  assess  overall  Project  effectiveness.  The  agreed\nperformance indicators are given in Appendix 14.\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Impact\n123. The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental\nexamination was prepared and a summary is a supplementary appendix. Significant negative\nenvironmental  effects  resulting  from  the  construction  activities  are  not  anticipated  as  the\nmajority of navigation aids already exist. The physical area that will be disturbed for construction\nof new navigation aids is very small. By their very nature, navigation aids are constructed in", "29\nareas where the risk of marine accidents is greatest, thus these installation sites are actually\nsited to have a positive environmental effect by reducing the potential for marine accidents and\nresulting environmental destruction. A detailed environmental impact assessment is not needed.\n124. Negative  environmental  effects  during  construction  will  be  insignificant  provided\nstandard  construction  practices  and  specifications  are  adhered  to.  Contracts  will  include\nenvironmental  impact  mitigating  requirements  for  construction  methodologies,  equipment\nstandards, waste management, and emergency contingency planning. For offshore installations,\nconstruction specifications will require that sites and anchoring locations for the construction\nbarges be  inspected  to  identify  locations  that  will  result  in  minimal  impact on  the  marine\nenvironment. Where onshore, construction access will be via established road or pathways, and\nwill avoid any sensitive ecological areas that may have been identified.\n2. Social Dimensions\n125. The Project will have a positive social impact throughout the country. It will improve\noverall quality of life, particularly among coastal communities, which will directly benefit from\nimproved maritime services. The Project will facilitate efficient and safe sea transport, increase\naccess  to  social  services,  and  reduce  cargo  transport  costs.  Specifically,  the  maritime\nimprovements  will  contribute  to  improved  access  to  schools,  medical  care,  and  markets,\nparticularly  for  isolated  rural  communities.  Community  surveys  and  consultations  indicate\nwidespread beneficiary support for the Project. They understand the need for, and value of\nnavigation aids to their villages. The Project also includes extensive community involvement.\nThrough the community engagement program, the communities will contribute directly to the\nongoing sustainability of the system of navigation aids. In return, the communities will directly\nbenefit from the fee for service agreements. No relocation or resettlement of households and\ngardens will be required for the Project. An initial social analysis is a supplementary appendix.\n3. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n126. The rehabilitation works under the Project consist of restoration works on the existing\nstructures.  For  new  works,  land  needs  to  be  procured  or  acquired  through  land-lease\nagreements for the new navigation aids. The Project involves no relocation. As necessary, land\nwill be procured for project purposes by the Government in accordance with the consultative\nand legal process under its Land Act. The Government will acquire this land or rights to the\nrequired  lands  on  a  timely  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB's  policy  on  resettlement\ncompensation10  and  provide  compensation  including  crop  compensation,  as  required,  in\naccordance with ADB's relevant guidelines. Detailed designs will be sensitive to minimizing land\nacquisition. The land acquisition program is in Appendix 15.\n127. The Government, through DOTCA and with the support of the project implementation\nconsultants, will identify a program to resolve outstanding land claims. An allowance has been\nincluded in project budget for land acquisition and for gradually clearing backlog land claims.\n                                                       \n10\nADB. 1998.

The technical solutions under the Project have been selected using a least-cost analysis of\nthree possible technological options: (i) fixed navigation visual and radar aids (navigation aids), (ii)\nelectronic  navigation  systems,  and  (iii)  compulsory  pilotage.  Of  these  three  options,  fixed\nnavigation aids are considered the most feasible option for PNG. Electronic systems rely on, and\ngenerally complement, a well-functioning  navigation aids  system, not  replace  it. The use of\nelectronic systems is severely constrained by inadequate telecommunication and information\ntechnology  standards,  affordability,  maintenance  requirements,  and  the  poor  quality  of\nhydrographic charts. Compulsory pilotage is cumbersome and impractical, and still relies on the\nprovision of a system of navigation aids.\n2.  Economic Analysis\n129. The  economic  benefits  resulting  from  the  Project  are  estimated  by  comparing  the\nsituations with and without the Project. The economic costs of the six project components\ninclude  all  incremental  costs  associated  with  project  implementation,  such  as  detailed\nengineering and civil works, equipment, community programs, hydrographic service, training,\nsector reorganization, and operation and maintenance. The project benefits stem from two key\nimprovements: the Project will result in a significant reduction in voyage times due to faster\nsailings, shorter sailing distances, and less voyage restrictions, such as allowing voyages at\nnight or during times of poor visibility. Secondly, there will be considerable improvement in\nmaritime safety. The Project will increase the total number of fixed navigation aids in the\nnetwork from the present 166 to 201, and will more than double the number of presently\noperable navigation aids in the network. Full implementation of the technical, institutional, and\nsocial components of the Project will improve the sustained availability of each light. The key\neconomic benefits result from the following:\n(i) improved efficiency in the provision of existing maritime transport services; as a\nresult  of  reduced  voyage  times,  the  shipping  subsector  will  be  able  to  (a)\ntransport the same cargo and passenger volume using less vessel capacity at\nless cost, or (b) transport more cargo and passengers with the same vessel\ncapacity and cost;\n(ii) increased passenger time savings and overall convenience resulting from faster\nand potentially more frequent vessel services;\n(iii) reductions in onboard cargo costs due to faster transit through coastal waters;\n(iv) improved delivery of goods and services to coastal communities that depend on\nmaritime modes of transport;\n(v) expanded network coverage by opening new channels, and providing shorter\nand safer routes; and\n(vi)  reduced maritime risks of accidents and loss of lives, goods, and equipment.", "31\n3.  Economic Internal Rate of Return\n130. The opportunity costs for not undertaking the Project were estimated by calculating an\naverage cost of a vessel day at K5,000 per vessel day ($1,700). This assumed benefit from time\nsavings were calculated only for registered vessels exceeding 15 meters. Smaller vessels\u2014\nabundant and a primary transport mode in PNG\u2014would benefit from the project outputs and\nincrease the cumulative project benefits. Benefits from avoided accidents have been estimated\nusing the Government\u2019s estimates for damage from its incident records.\n131. Comparison of the benefits of the with-project situation with the without-project case,\nyielded considerable benefits to the PNG economy. The resulting economic internal rate of return\nobtained was 25.12 percent. The results of sensitivity analyses, given in Table 2, testing Project\nviability for primary parameters also demonstrates robust economic viability of the Project. Details\nof the economic analysis are in Appendix 16.\nTable 2: Sensitivity Test\nEconomic Internal Net Present Switching Sensitivity\nSensitivity Test Rate of Return Value Value Indicator\nPercent Million\nBase Case 25.12  $36.94 \u2014 \u2014\n1. 20 percent increase in costs 20.23  $27.30 0.76 (1.31)\n2. 20 percent decrease in benefits 19.24  $19.91 1.06 (2.31)\n3. 1 year delay in construction schedule 19.99  $26.18 \u2014 \u2014\n4. 30 percent depreciation of local currency 19.73  $26.09 1.20 (0.98)\n5. All tests combined 12.46  $1.65 \u2014 \u2014\nB. Impact on Poverty\n132. The Project will contribute directly and indirectly to poverty reduction in the coastal\nprovinces by (i) providing direct income to landowners and villages where the navigation aids\nare located; and (ii) facilitating safer access to markets and much needed social services such\nas education and medical facilities, especially in isolated coastal communities.\n133. The direct impacts benefiting the poor include cash payments to landowners for lease of\nland and training, and cash payments to community members for light maintenance and security\nservices. Indirect impacts include (i) more convenient, safer, more reliable, and more frequent\nmaritime passenger and cargo service; (ii) improved access to markets in adjacent communities\nand on other islands for purchasing and selling goods (produce and handicrafts) and services;\n(iii) improved access to social services, especially health and education services;  and  (iv)\nformation of a viable community social structure (the core groups) with capacity to disseminate\ninformation and to coordinate village activities to support village welfare beyond the activities\nrequired to maintain the navigation aids. While the Government supports ceilings to shipping\nrates due to competition among shipping companies within specific coastal areas, the shipping\nindustry is expected to translate improved vessel performance into an enhanced vessel fleet\nand reductions in the freight and passenger rates. The Project will also provide for direct income\nto the landowning families and communities in the form of lease payments and maintenance\nservice fees. It will engage individuals in the communities to do maintenance work such as\nwashing solar panels, cutting grass, and painting. These arrangements will be financed from the\nDOTCA annual budget and later from the MSA's budget.", "32\n134. Women\u2019s groups will be directly involved in monitoring project components through their\nmembership in the community core group. The main goal is the facilitation of mutually beneficial\ncommunity participation income arrangements between the government, nongovernment and\ncommunity-based organizations, and communities. This, together with land-lease payments,\nservice fees, and improvement in access to safer coastal transport, for both commercial vessels\nand passenger boats, will contribute to improved economic activities and reduced poverty in the\ntarget areas.\n135. The share of poor among the total population in the project catchment area is 40.2\npercent. When compared with the national poverty ratio 37.5 percent, the Project qualifies as\npro-poor and a poverty-reducing intervention. Detailed description of the direct and indirect\nbenefits on the poor has been prepared as a supplementary appendix.\nC. Risks\n136. The Project is not subject to any unusual risks. The main risks are (i) economic shocks\u2014\ndownturns in international trade and the economy, and (ii) the shortage of counterpart funds.\nThe  risk  of  economic  shocks  has  been  reduced  as  a  result  of  the  Government\u2019s  recent\neconomic  policies.  With  regard  to  counterpart  funding,  the  Government's  current  policy\nemphasizes the importance of transport safety and effective utilization of existing infrastructure\nassets. The project design  seeks  to  minimize the  risk of  insufficient  counterpart funds by\ncombining design features and preventive conditions. These include establishment of navigation\naids trust accounts that would hold revenues from the light dues and increasingly finance\noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  navigation  aids  network.  Land  acquisition  issues  are\naddressed as one of the main project components; the Project aims to establish a system under\nwhich land acquisition claims would be paid under a more acceptable format than in the past.\nThe Project also addresses important endemic challenges to establishing efficient maritime\nsafety services, including the need to  resolve  institutional  issues  and  recurring  vandalism.\nThese risk areas were identified early in the project development process and realistic programs\nfor institutional change and community development have been devised in detail.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n137. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  DOTCA will disengage from the operation of the navigation aids vessel Sepura\nby 30 April 2001.\n(ii)  By 30 April 2001, the Government will submit a reorganization plan to ADB for\ndiscussion  outlining  the  proposed  statutory  authority  for  maritime  safety,  its\nfunctions,  responsibilities,  financial  autonomy,  power  for  collecting  fees  and\ncharges, staffing, and management.\n(iii)  By 30 September 2001, the Government will submit to the National Parliament,\ntaking into account the recommendations made under project support to sector\nreorganization,  a  bill  providing  for  establishment  of  a  statutory  authority  for\nmaritime safety.", "33\n(iv)  In  the  event  that  the  set  user  fees  do  not  adequately  cover  the  financial\nobligations  and  operations  of  the  established  statutory  authority  of  maritime\nsafety, the Government will finance any shortfall of funds to ensure effective and\nefficient operation and maintenance of the navigation aids system and provision\nof maritime safety services.\n(v)  The Government will clear, or will finance clearance of, the backlog of land\ncompensation  claims  that  relate  to  land  occupied  by  the  navigation  aids\ninstallations.  The  schedule  will  be  gradual,  clearing  20  percent  per  annum,\ncommencing immediately after establishment of the authority.\n(vi)  In the event of compensation and involuntary resettlement arising from  land\nacquisition required for the Project, the Government will ensure that (a) such\nresettlement  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  Government\nguidelines and ADB\u2019s policies and procedures on resettlement; and (b) all land\nrequired for the Project will nevertheless be acquired and compensation issues\nresolved prior to approval of tender for the respective construction contracts.\n(vii)  DOTCA  will  issue  public  quarterly  reports  and  budgets  for  the  forthcoming\nquarters on collection and expenditures made from the navigation aids  trust\naccount for the review of NAAC, in addition to its internal reporting requirements.\n(viii)  The Government will maintain a dialogue with ADB on the  status of  relevant\ntransport issues, including maritime safety and rescue operations and plans, oil\nspill prevention, tariffs for user charges, sector funding, institutional organization,\nand external assistance.\n(ix)  The Government will budget adequate counterpart funding of a least K5.5 million\nper annum for project implementation in accordance with the financing plan.\nB. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n138. The Government has agreed to the following conditions for loan effectiveness:\n(i)  The  Government  will  establish  a  maritime  safety  trust  account  and  deposit\nrevenues from the navigation aids dues and the oil pollution levy to the account\nas an interim measure prior to Parliamentary promulgation of an autonomous\nMSA.\n(ii)  The Government will have approved the submission to the Parliament an oil\npollution levy to recover costs of oil pollution prevention, detection, and capacity\nfor cleanup, which will be paid to the maritime safety trust account.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n139. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $20,600,000 to the Independent State\nof Papua New Guinea for the Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids System Project\nfrom ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's", "34\npool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans and with an amortization period of\n25 years, including a grace period of five years, and such other terms and conditions as are\nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the\nBoard.\nTADAO CHINO\nPRESIDENT\n17 August 2000", "35\nAPPENDIXES\nNo. Title Page Cited on\n(page , para.)\n1 Project Framework 36 1, 3\n2 Vessel Traffic and Cargo Volumes, 1989-1999 37 4, 15\n3 Organization Chart 38 8, 36\n4 Maritime Sector Restructuring Action Plan 39 13, 57\n5 Financial Analysis of the Maritime Safety Authority 40 14, 59\n6 Schedule of Navigation Aids Fees 47 15, 66\n7 Oil Spill Levy 48 17, 76\n8 Outline Terms of Reference for Advisory Consulting\nServices for Reorganizing the Maritime Sector 50 22, 95\n9 Navigation Aids Proposed for Repair, Replacement, or 22, 96\nNew Construction By Year 53\n10 Outline Terms of Reference for Project Implementation\nand Establishment of Hydrographic Services 54 24, 103\n11 Detailed Cost Estimates 61 24, 104\n12 Tentative Contract Packages 62 26, 113\n13 Implementation Schedule 63 27, 115\n14 Project Performance Report 64 28, 122\n15 Land Acquisition Plan 67 29, 126\n16 Economic Analysis 68 31, 131\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available upon request)\nA Summary Initial Environmental Examination\nB Initial Social Analysis\nC Poverty Impact Assessment", "36 Appendix 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nProject Monitoring Risks/\nDesign Summary Targets Mechanism Assumptions\nA.

Assumptions in Revenue Estimation\n1. Income Sources\n1. The principal revenue sources for the Maritime Safety Authority (MSA)  will be the\nnavigation aids dues (known as \u2018light dues') and Protection of the Sea levy (POSL). Light dues\nfor both domestic and international vessels were recently increased effective 1 January 2000\nby 75 percent to K60 per meter for vessels paying annually. The navigation aids dues are\nexpected to remain at the current levels until 2002, and that, in line with the proposal of the\nDepartment of Transport and Civil Aviation (DOTCA), a POSL of K0.30 per net registered ton\n(nrt) per quarter will be introduced prior to the establishment of the Maritime Safety Authority\n(MSA).\n2. A total revenue from minor sources relating to services of the MSA, including survey\nfees, chart sales, and vessel registration fees, is estimated at K0.16 million in 2001. These\nrevenues are assumed to grow in real terms at the same rate as the domestic vessel fleet.\nRevenue from hydrographic services (chart sales and the sale of data) is assumed to increase\nover five years to about four times the current level, reflecting establishment of the national\nhydrographic capability and development of an appropriate pricing regime. All charges are\nadjusted every two years for inflation.\n3. Cash balances held by the MSA are assumed to be invested from time to time and the\ninterest credited to the MSA\u2019s account. The interest rate on such investments is included at 5\npercent per annum.\n2.  Vessels Volumes\ni.  International Vessels Calling at Papua New Guinea ports\n4. All commercial international vessels calling in Papua New Guinea (PNG) ports are\nassumed to pay both the navigation aids dues (light dues) and the proposed POSL. Total calls\nof overseas vessels increased steadily from 1,179 in 1988 to 3,159 per annum in 1996, before\nthe Asian crisis precipitated a sharp decline to 2,347 in 1998. While official data for 1999 and\nthe first half of 2000 is not available, with recovery of most Asian economies a resurgence in\nvessel numbers can be confidently expected. The number of calls in 2001 has been assumed\nto be 3,147\u2014the same number as in 1997.\n5.  Eighty percent of overseas vessel calls are assumed to be made by vessels paying the\nannual fee: the remainder of calls are by vessels paying on a per voyage basis. On average,\nthese vessels are assumed to make three calls per quarter. These assumptions are consistent\nwith the amount of revenue that has been collected from overseas vessels by the Papua New\nGuinea Harbour Board (PNGHB).\nii. Kumul Oil Terminal\n6. Based on navigation dues payments for the last five years, 60 vessels use the Kumul\noil terminal each year. All vessels calling at the Kumul oil terminal pay their light dues on a per", "41\nAppendix 5, page 2\nvoyage basis, implying that individual vessels will not make more than three voyages per year.\nEach vessel is therefore assumed to pay both navigation aids dues and the POSL on each\ncall.\niii. Domestic\n7. About 420 domestic vessels registered in PNG exceed 15 meters (m) in length, and are\nthus required to pay navigation aid dues. About 60 percent of these exceed 24 m in length\u2014\nthe proposed threshold for the POSL. Fifty percent of the vessels required to pay light dues\nare assumed to pay the POSL.\n3. Vessel size\n8. Overseas and international vessels average 3,231 nrt and 553 nrt, respectively. A\nfigure of 60,000 per vessel\u2014appropriate for vessels averaging 240 m in length was used for\ncallers at the Kumul oil terminal.\n4. Growth rates\n9. Overseas vessel calls are estimated to increase by 3.7 percent per year: This is one\nhalf of the geometric average growth rate experienced during 1988-1998, and approximates\nthe  long-term  growth  rate  of  international  maritime  trade.  The  average  vessel  size  in\ninternational trade increases by 2 percent per annum. The growth rate for the domestic fleet is\nestimated at 1.7 percent, in line with experience of the last decade. Exports from the Kumul oil\nterminal were assumed to remain at their current level throughout the forecast period.\n5. Effectiveness of Revenue Collection\n10. Evidence suggests effectiveness of revenue collection can be improved. The Project\nincludes components aimed at enhancing revenue collection effectiveness. Experience with\nthe collection of similar dues in other countries suggests that, if properly implemented, the\npayment of light dues will be difficult to evade, and with the proposed support, a very high\nproportion of potential revenues can be realized. Eighty-five percent of the revenues due from\nlight dues and the POSL are assumed to be collected in 2001, 95 percent in 2002, and 99\npercent in 2003 and the subsequent years.\nB.  Assumptions Operating Expenses Estimation\n1. Salary Costs\n11. A summary of all operating expenses is given in Table A5. A first draft organizational\nstructure for the MSA was developed to estimate staff costs. This structure includes a total of\n50 permanent positions: 17 less than the staff complement of the Maritime Division of DOTCA\n(excluding the crew of Kulasi and Sepura). Salary levels within the Maritime Safety Branch\n(MSB) are low, and the salary scale compressed. As a result, MSB has difficulty retaining\nqualified and experienced staff in technical and managerial positions. This problem needs to\nbe addressed if the MSA is to be effective. Thus, the assumed salaries will in general be\nhigher than those currently paid by MSB. The differential is higher for more senior positions,\nranging from 20 percent for base grade administrative support staff to 60 percent at senior", "42\nAppendix 5, page 3\nexecutive levels. The total salary and benefit costs were estimated at K1,291,000 per year.\nSalary costs were assigned to cost centers within the MSA.\n2. Corporate Expenses\n12. Corporate expenses include the salaries of the chief executive officer as well as the\nthree divisional directors, the salaries of other corporate services offices, including accounting\nstaff. The financial analysis also includes a K21,000 per year allowance for board fees, based\non a 7-member board meeting monthly and a sitting fee of K250 per day. Annual rental costs\nare estimated at K250,000 per year\u2014in line with current rental costs at K21,000 per month. An\nallowance  of  K70,000  per  year  for  office  expenses  includes  provision  for  30  desktop\ncomputers and 10 networked printers with a replacement cycle of three years, as well as\nK25,000 per year for general office expenses.\n3. Navigational Aids Maintenance Costs\n13. Estimates for the several nonsalary cost components for navigational aids maintenance\ninclude cost of spare parts, estimated at K200,000 per year, and cost of training at K50,000\nper year. A comprehensive review of efficient logistics for the MSA is included under the sector\nreorganization component of the Project. The logistics support would be purchased in a cost-\neffective way from private providers through a competitive process. Costs are based on a daily\nvessel hire rate of K4,500 per day (inclusive of fuel), and helicopter hire rates of K2,400 per\nflying hour. The services of a navigation aids vessel would be required for 150 days per year,\nand helicopter flying time for 20 hours per year. A total of 100 days of vehicle hire has been\nallowed. The total costs of logistics support for navigational aids maintenance has therefore\nbeen estimated at K735,000 per year. The cost of training, transport, and spare parts for the\nnavigational aids are assumed from the Project for the duration of the Project. These expenses\nare therefore attributed to the MSA budget from 2006 onward.\n4. Community Program\n14. A community engagement program is a central to the strategy for reducing vandalism.\nFive full-time staff positions are allocated for the program  with  salary  costs  estimated  at\nK102,000 per year. An allowance of K400,000 per year is included for annual lease and\nlandowner services payments and K400,000 is included in each of the five years 2001 to 2005\nto finance clearing the backlog of land compensation claims. Travel and per diem associated\nwith landowner liaison, training in maintenance practices of community groups, and public\ninformation and awareness activities have been included. These expenditures peak in the\nearly years as the program is established, and stabilize at a lower level from 2004. The cost of\ncommunity maintenance contracts is estimated at K1,200 per year per site. Most sites, but not\nall, would be covered by community contracts. These are assumed to increase to 180 by 2004,\nand remain at that level thereafter.\n5. Hydrographic Services\n15. Hydrographic  services  are  provided  by  two  full-time  professional  staff  within  the\nhydrographic unit. the PNG Defense Force (PNGDF) will also assist the hydrographic unit by\nseconding one person. Field surveys are the major recurrent cost for hydrographic services.\nMSA will contract vessel services for 120 days per year with a daily charter cost of a suitable", "Appendix 5, page 4\n43\nvessel of K5,000 per day. This variable cost will vary with new field survey work subject to the\ncapacity to fund such surveys.\n16.  Chart production costs of K40,000 per year in 2002, rising to 100,000 in subsequent\nyears, has been assumed. Provisions of K20,000 per year for office expenses, and K150,000\nper  year  for  equipment  maintenance  and  replacement,  has  also  been  included  in  the\nhydrographic budget.\n17. Field survey and all equipment costs are assumed to be met from project funds during\nthe project period and from 2006 will become the responsibility of the MSA. Salaries, chart\nproduction, and office costs will be met by the MSA from inception.\n18. The financial analysis assumes that chart prices are set at a level that will fully offset\nthe avoidable costs of chart production and distribution. The precise value assumed for chart\nproduction costs therefore has little effect on the overall outcome of the analysis.\n6. Surveys and Examination\n19. The majority of the costs associated with ship surveys and examinations are salary\ncosts.  Due  to  DOTCA's  considerable  difficulty  in  retaining  qualified  ship  surveyors,  ship\nsurveyors\u2019 salaries are increased from 40 and 50 percent. A provision for training of K50,000\nper year is also included. Effective and efficient survey function, and port state control, will\nimply a significant amount of travel by ship surveyors, and a travel budget of K30,000 per year\nis thus provided\n7. Oil Spill Prevention and Emergency Response\n20. Depreciation of the value of oil spill equipment is assumed at K3,500,000, reflecting the\nvalue of equipment purchased under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan program1 with\nan eight-year depreciation period. The cost of oil spill response activities is estimated  at\nK155,000 per year including salary and benefits. Office and administrative expenses to cover\ntelecommunications, stationery, office equipment, and travel are K180,000 in the first year.\n8.  Inflation\n21. A uniform inflation rate of 5 percent per annum is assumed.\nC.  Other Assumptions\n22. The principal asset of the new MSA will be the stock of existing navigation aids with a\nreplacement value of K36.6 million based on an average replacement value of K300,000 for\nthe 122 existing installations not be replaced under the Project. The assumed written down\nvalue of these installations is 50 percent of their replacement value. The value of newly\nreplaced or additional navigation aids has been added to the MSA\u2019s balance sheet as they are\nconstructed. Funding of these facilities has been treated as an equity injection. Depreciation of\nnavigation  aids  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  a  15-year  economic  life.  A  progressive\nreplacement or complete refurbishment of navigation aids not replaced during the Project has\n                                               \n1 Loan 1153/1154-PNG: Transport Infrastructure Development Project, for $69 million, approved on 14 January\n1992.", "44\nAppendix 5, page 5\nbeen allowed immediately following the completion of the Project, i.e., from 2006. Oil spill\ncontrol equipment is valued at K3.5 million. No allowance has been included in the opening\nasset base for any land, buildings, or office furnishing that may be transferred to the MSA. This\nomission is not expected to impact on any of the key findings of the analysis.\n23. In the cash flow analysis, 80 percent of revenues are assumed to be received in the\nyear in which it becomes due, and 90 percent of nondepreciation expenses are paid in the\nyear in which they become due. It is assumed that the MSA will not pay tax or dividends to the\nGovernment.\nD.  Principal Results of the Financial Analysis\n24. The financial analysis indicates that a self-financing MSA is a realistic objective. To\nachieve this, a real increase of 25 percent in navigation aids dues will be necessary in 2002.\nEven with this increase, the level of dues would be reasonable by international standards.\n25. With this increase and modest trade growth, the MSA is able to maintain an adequate\ncash balance, while meeting all of its own operating and capital needs. The risk that a properly\nmanaged MSA will need to make demands on consolidated revenue funds is therefore low.\nAlthough the cash position of the MSA should be sound from the outset, it will not become\nconsistently profitable until around 2008. The strong projected cash position during the second\ndecade of operation suggests scope for real price reductions, or alternatively for the payment\nof a dividend to the Government during this period.\n26. The MSA will create benefits to the broader community as well as the shipping industry.\nIn particular, the hydrographic services and the MSA\u2019s contribution to search and rescue\noperations could be recognized by a transparent subsidy from Government. However, this\nwould make the MSA\u2019s finances again dependent, in part, on the Government budgetary\nprocess, which could place at risk many of the Project's benefits. No explicit subsidy is thus\nassumed. It does, however, set rates and charges to the shipping industry at levels that, while\nthey generate sufficient cash flow to ensure the financial autonomy of the  MSA,  yield  a\nsubcommercial rate of return. Under these price assumptions, the return on equity would\nstabilize during the second decade of operations at around 6 percent per annum.

Key Assumptions of the Analysis\n1. All commercial international vessels calling in Papua New  Guinea  (PNG)  ports are\nassumed to pay the levy. Total overseas commercial vessel calls increased steadily from 1,179\nin 1998 to 3,159 per annum in 1996, before the Asian crisis precipitated a sharp decline to\n2,347 in 1998. Although official data for 1999 and the first half of 2000 is not available, with\nrecovery now established in most Asian economies a resurgence in vessel numbers can be\nconfidently expected. The number of calls in 2001 has been assumed to be 3,147\u2014the same\nnumber as in 1997. It is assumed that overseas vessels make, on average, 3 calls per quarter.\nSixty vessels use the Kumul oil terminal per year, all of which pay their light dues on a per\nvoyage basis, implying that individual vessels make less than three voyages per year. The oil\nspill levy would therefore assumed be paid on each call. About 420 domestic vessels are\nregistered in PNG, of which 60 percent exceed 24 meters (m) in length. About 50 percent of the\nregistered fleet has been used in the revenue estimates.\nB. Vessel size and Growth Rates\n2. Average net registered tonnages (nrts) for overseas and international vessels are 3,231\nand 553, respectively. Vessels calling at Kumul oil terminal are 60,000. Calls by overseas\nvessels are assumed to grow by 3.7 percent per annum. The average vessel size in the\ninternational trade increases by 2 percent per annum.\nC. Costs\n3. The purchase value of oil spill equipment is K3.5 million. The depreciation period of eight\nyears was retained. Staff costs are K180,000 per year including salary and benefits based on\nsix full-time equivalent positions with an average full-time remuneration package of K30,000 per\nyear. An allowance of 10 percent has been included to cover office and administrative expenses\nadding about K116,000 to the budget in the first year. An inflation allowance of 5 percent per\nannum has been included in the estimation of all future cost components. Costs relating directly\nto individual incidents are generally recoverable from the responsible party. The majority of the\ncosts  included  in  the  analysis  are,  therefore,  associated  with  maintaining  the  response\ncapability, and are, as a consequence, fixed. The anticipated increase in ship traffic will result in\nincreased revenues, while it will not add significantly to the agency\u2019s costs.

All land will be leased rather than permanently acquired. Standard arrears will be paid in\nadvance of signing leases for the navigation aids sites. Of the existing 166 navigation aids sites,\ncompensation claims have been received from 49 landowners. Many of these do not provide a\npractical basis for resolving the issue. Litigation to resolve them would be with lengthy and\nunaffordable delays. Consequently, under the Project, all navigation aids sites, whether a claim\nhas been lodged or not, will be treated on an equal basis, i.e., a standard arrears payment be\noffered for every existing site.\n2. The  acquisition  of  land  access  rights  by  the  Government  will  be  progressively\nimplemented as navigation aids are either rehabilitated or newly constructed over the five-year\nimplementation period. The steps required to gain the rights and access to land required under\nthe Project are summarized in Table A15.\nTable A15: Land Acquisition Plan\nActions Time Period\n1.

If the landowner(s) agree with the conditions of the lease, appoint a provincial One week\nlands department representative(s) to attend the site to promulgate the lease\nagreement with the identified land owners. The function of the core group and\nprovincial authorities at this point of the process is to facilitate agreement of\nlandowners to the standard lease terms.\n8. If the landowner(s) disagree with the lease conditions and refuse to sign the Up to three months\nagreement, convene the core group with support from provincial authorities as\nrequired to resolve issues and obtain voluntary landowner agreement.\n9.

Introduction\n1. The Project includes (i) sector reorganization, (ii) installation or rehabilitation of 198\nnavigation  aids,  (iii)  establishment  of  a  self-reliant  hydrographic  service,  (iv)  training,  (v)\ncommunity  engagement  program,  and  (vi)  support  to  project  management.  The  capital\ninvestment includes lighting of two new shipping routes along the Papua New Guinea (PNG)\ncoast\u2014Nuakata and Nessup channels.\n2. The least-cost analysis of the Project has considered three alternative technologies to\nmeet  the  required  safety  and  efficiency  improvements  for  maritime  navigation:  (i)  fixed\nnavigational  visual  and  radar  aids,  (ii)  electronic  navigation  systems,  and  (iii)  compulsory\npilotage. Economic analysis  has been undertaken  comparing  the  with-project and  without-\nproject alternatives.\nB. Least-Cost Alternatives\n1. Fixed Navigational Visual Aids\n3. Traditionally, maritime navigation has relied exclusively on visual sightings to establish\nvessel position. For coastal navigation, natural or artificially derived visual, and more recently\nradar, aids located on land or water mark navigable channels and warn of submerged hazards,\nwhile celestial aids\u2014the sun, moon, and stars\u2014have been used to navigate through open\nwaters. For several centuries, purposefully constructed navigation aids have been the mainstay\nof coastal maritime navigation, guiding vessels through shallow and difficult waters. Worldwide,\nnetworks of navigation aids remain a primary coastal navigation tool.\n4. Current navigation aids technology includes the use of high intensity, low voltage electric\nlighting  systems.  Most  navigation  aids  are  solar  powered,  and  capable  of  providing  high\nperformance light without the need for costly refueling. The navigation aids generally allow for\nseveral  years\u2019  operability  with  minimal  annual  or  semiannual  maintenance.  Structures\nsupporting the navigation aids are usually simple in design: concrete pile structures located in\nshallow water, floating buoys in deeper water, or towers on land.\n5. Navigation aids provide visual signals to mariners, enabling them to fix position, and\nguide them through difficult waters or into port. In addition, some navigation aids incorporate\nradar transponder beacons (racons), allowing mariners to sight navigation aids in poor visibility.\nA navigation aids system is fundamental to maritime navigation, and its use is second nature to\nall mariners. Every maritime nation maintains a navigation aids system; this is considered an\ninternational obligation.\n2. Electronic Navigation Systems\n6. Advancements over the past two decades have resulted in use of global positioning\nsystems (GPS) by the maritime industry. Based on satellite technology, these systems provide\naccurate  positioning  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  Where  coastal  hydrographic  charts  are\naccurate, commercially available GPS systems can establish positions in charted waters to an\naccuracy  of  a  few  meters.  Use  of  a  GPS  system  requires  commensurately  accurate\nhydrographic charts and provision of a GPS receiver system on board vessels.", "69\nAppendix 16, page 2\n7. In practice, the system relies on the functioning of sophisticated equipment and accurate\ncoastal charts. The charts available for PNG\u2019s coastal waters are not sufficiently accurate to\npermit reliance on a GPS for practical navigation purposes. Moreover, systems such as this fail\noccasionally, and backup systems must be concurrently available. For this reason, and due to\nmariners\u2019 instinctive reliance on visual sightings, GPS and other similar electronic systems are\nalways complemented by a fully functioning navigation aids network of navigation aids. Even\nwith  the  most  sophisticated onboard GPS  system,  mariners  always  check  vessel  position\nthrough visual sightings, wherever possible.\n8. These systems are, therefore, complementary and additional to a network of navigation\naids, and are not an alternative to fixed navigation aids. This is the case even in the most highly\ndeveloped nations, where navigation aids continue to play a key role in maritime navigation.\nThis  is  particularly  relevant  in  PNG,  due  to  the  low  level  of  technological  capabilities,\naffordability constraints, maintenance difficulties, and poor quality of hydrographic charts.\n3. Compulsory Pilotage\n9. In  areas  of  difficult,  complex,  or  crowded  waters,  the  use  of  pilots  is  sometimes\ncompulsory. In this case, a specially trained pilot will take control of a vessel and steer it through\na specified area. Pilots are considered experts in their jurisdictional waters, often to the point\nthat they no longer need the guidance of local navigation aids. It is theoretically possible\ntherefore, that a comprehensive system of compulsory pilotage could be established to replace\nnavigation aids over part or all of the system.\n10. In practice, however, compulsory pilotage would clearly be impractical as a replacement\nfor the entire network of navigation aids. First, pilots still need to rely on navigation aids, no\nmatter how experienced they are in certain areas. Second, with over 7,000 recorded sailings per\nyear of larger ships alone, the pilotage capacity required to avoid navigational bottlenecks would\nbe far greater than could be achieved in practice.\n4. Conclusions\n11. The provision of a network of navigation aids is considered a viable option. It provides a\nreliable, low-technology solution, which has proven sustainability and applicability to PNG. A\nnetwork  of  navigation  aids  currently  exists  within  PNG,  and  with  careful  rehabilitation,\nexpansion, and support can provide a long-term solution for navigational needs. While the\nprovision of GPS or similar systems may be appropriate for PNG in the future, it should be seen\nonly to complement a navigation aids network, not replace it. The alternative of exclusive\ncompulsory pilotage is not considered a viable option, and would also only complement parts of\nthe  network,  not  replace  it.  In  conclusion,  establishing  and  maintaining  a  navigation  aids\nnetwork is the least-cost technically acceptable option to provide the required navigational\nimprovements. Project activities have therefore focused on the development of an affordable,\nappropriate system for the existing maritime sector.\nC. Project Costs\n12. The  project  costs  for  economic  evaluation  comprise  civil  works  construction  costs,\nequipment for navigation aids, establishment of the hydrographic services, community program,\nsector  reorganization  and  project  management,  physical  contingencies,  and  incremental\noperation and maintenance costs. The costs were derived from their estimation in financial\nterms on the basis on unit rates for all items of works that reflect experience under past", "70\nAppendix 16, page 3\ncontracts, international experience, and quotations for the lighting and battery equipment. The\nfinancial cost values have been adjusted to economic values by extracting taxes and duties, and\nby  applying  conversion  factors  for  local  labor  of  0.85  and  0.96  for  technical  nontraded\ncomponents.\n13. Overall, benefits from the Project primarily stem from two key improvements. First, the\nProject will result in significant reductions in voyage times due to faster sailings, shorter sailing\ndistances (in some cases), and in less voyage restrictions (such as allowing voyages at night or\nduring times of poor visibility). Second, there will be considerable improvements in maritime\nsafety. Third, vessel cost savings have been estimated from the  opening of  the  two  new\nchannels. Fourth, safety and fishing industry improvements resulting from improved surveys and\nhydrographic charts have been estimated. The Project will increase the total number of fixed\nnavigation aids in the network from 166 presently to 201, and will approximately double the\nnumber  of  presently  operable  navigation  aids  in  the  network.  Full  implementation  of  the\ntechnical, institutional, and social recommendations of the Project will dramatically improve the\nsustained availability of each light. The key economic benefits resulting from the Project include\nthe following:\n(i)  improved efficiency in the provision of existing maritime transport services; due to\nreduced voyage times, the shipping sector will be able to (a) transport the same\ncargo and passenger volume using less vessel capacity at commensurately less\ncost, or (b) transport more cargo and passengers with the same vessel capacity\nand cost;\n(ii)  increased passenger time savings and overall convenience resulting from faster\nand potentially more frequent vessel services;\n(iii)  reductions in onboard cargo costs due to faster transit through coastal waters;\n(iv)  improved delivery of goods and services to coastal communities that depend on\nmaritime modes of transport;\n(v)  expanded network coverage; and\n(vi)  reduced maritime risks of accidents and loss of lives, goods, and equipment.\n1. Voyage Cost Savings\n14. Currently, the industry suffers from (i) inefficient routings between ports made necessary\nto avoid poorly marked hazards along more direct routes; (ii) longer than necessary layovers in\nports to make sailing times coincide with daylight hours and ideal visual conditions; and (iii)\nslower speeds to accommodate inadequate knowledge and warnings about the precise location\nof hazards. The Project will improve transport efficiency by reducing current constraints, and\nenabling faster sailings, shorter sailing distances, and less voyage restrictions. Quantification of\nthis benefit has been performed as follows; (i) estimating the indicative annual cost of major\nmaritime shipping services in PNG, (ii) estimating overall cost savings as a result of the Project,\nand (iii) performing an economic analysis to determine economic viability gained from the\nbenefit. The estimate is based on calculating the economic cost of an average vessel day, and\nmultiplying this by the estimated number of vessel days within the sector (Table A16.1).", "71\nAppendix 16, page 4\nTable A16.1: Total Shipping Cost Estimate (Economic Values, K)1\nParameter Assumption\nNumber of Vessels in PNG watersa Coastal (domestic) vesselsb 420\nInternational vesselsc  80\nTotal 500\nNumber of working days per vessel/ Coastal (locally registered) vessels 180 days/yr\nyear International (in PNG waters)  90 days/yr\nTotal number of working days Coastal: 180 days x 420 vessels 75,600 days/yr\nInternational: 90 days x 80 vessels  7,200 days/yr\nTotal 82,800 days/yr\nCost per working day per vesseld Average              5,000 vessel-day\nTotal indicative cost/year 82,800 vessel days x K5,000 per day K414,000,000\nPNG=Papua New Guinea.\na  Registered vessels exceeding 15 meter (m) length are included in the estimate.\nb Source: Register of Vessels of Maritime Transport Division.\nc\nSource: PNG Harbours Board.\nd  Costs per vessel-day depend upon the size of ship, its workload, and its condition. Typical costs range between\nK3,000 (vessels less than 50 m length) to K10,000 (larger vessels). An average of K5,000 per vessel-day has been\nassumed. Financial cost of a vessel-day is derived from the standard operating cost of $2,000 for a coastal vessel\nof 50 m and of 1,500-2,000 tons, inclusive of fuel, lubricant oils, crew costs, insurance, and depreciation.\n15. The economic costs of commercial fleets operating in PNG waters computes to a total of\nK414 million ($145 million) annually. This is an indicative cost to transport the 4.7 million tons of\ncargo and 365,000 passengers2 annually to, from, and within PNG.\n16. In practice, the actual cost to the nation will most likely be significantly higher. Several\nvessel groups do not register all shipping movements, such as many of the logging and fishing\nvessels. In addition, smaller vessels (less than 15 meter length) have not been included in the\nestimate. Also, conservatism has been used in estimating the number and cost of working days\nin the calculation (para. 15), especially in estimating the average number of working days per\nvessel per year. It is concluded therefore, that an estimate of K414 million ($145 million) is\nconservative.\n17. A consensus view among shipping companies is that a fully rehabilitated navigation aids\nnetwork would enable an overall improvement in transport efficiency of up to 20 percent by\ncompanies that use the most heavily traveled routes (e.g., Port Moresby-Lae). This is reinforced\nby the industry\u2019s universal acceptance and enthusiasm for the Project. For the purposes of\neconomic analysis, an efficiency benefit to maritime transport of 2 percent is assumed. This\nassumption is considered appropriate as a conservative industry average. The assumed 2\npercent efficiency benefit equates to an overall benefit of K8.3 million ($2.9 million) per year to\nthe industry. There is also a high level of confidence that this benefit estimate is conservative,\nand that the actual benefit is significantly higher. First, not all vessel movements are included in\nthe estimate, which would naturally increase overall costs thereby increasing the level of benefit.\nSecond, the analysis only considers savings in direct shipping costs, and not the additional\nbenefits of passenger time savings; onboard cargo cost savings due to faster transit, or the\nimproved delivery of goods and services to coastal communities that depend  on  maritime\nmodes of transport. Third, the analysis does not account for vessel movement growth over the\nplanning period.\n                                                       \n1\nShipping costs are estimated on a gross output basis and do not compare with the share of transport services of\ngross domestic product, which is calculated on a value-added basis.\n2 Source: PNG Harbours Board (1998).", "72\nAppendix 16, page 5\n2. Safety Improvements\n18. An improved and expanded navigation aids system will considerably improve maritime\nsafety. An analysis of an incident rate and quantification of the associated economic cost\nrequired: (i) a review of incident records for PNG and identification of incidents, which can\nreasonably be attributed  to  current  navigation  aids  deficiencies,  and  (ii)  estimation  of  the\ncumulative economic benefit of preventing such incidents.\n19. Although  there  are  no  recent  Government  records  of  PNG  maritime  incidents,\ninformation is available for a number  of  shipping accidents  within  PNG  over  the  previous\ndecade.3 In total, available records have been reviewed for 29 maritime incidents within PNG\nwaters over the last eight years (1991-1998). Of these, 13 incidents have been determined to be\ncaused wholly or partially by navigational error. A summary of type of vessel and estimated\naccident cost is in Table A16.2.\nTable A16.2: Estimate of the Cost of Accidents Related to Poor Navigation aids in PNG\n1990-2000\nType of Estimated\nYear Accident Vessel Cost (K)\n1991 Adhijuna Nugraha\u2014grounded Logs 100,000\n1991 Maritime Hibiscus\u2014grounded Bulk carrier 250,000\n1992 Hand Cheong\u2014ran aground, heavy damage Logs 150,000\n1993 Armstrong\u2014ran aground in WNB 25,000\n1993 Carlina\u2014ran aground, superficial damage Logs 15,000\n1993 Pixy May\u2014ran aground 50,000\n1993 Tenyu Maru\u2014grounded 50,000\n1994 Dasa Sebelas\u2014grounded 150,000\n1994 Papuan Chief\u2014grounded, heavy damage Container 250,000\n1994 Samsun Brave\u2014grounded and sank, with 10 lives Fishing boat 3,000,000\n1995 Armada Kasturi\u2014grounded Logs 50,000\n1998 Niugini Coast\u2014grounded 10,000\n1998 Star Sun\u2014grounded and sank Logs 1,000,000\nTotal 5,100,000\nWNB=West New Britain.\nSource: Lloyds Data.\n20. Table A16.2 provides an indicative amount of the likely direct costs of the 13 incidents.\nSome of the reported incidents were only minor such as temporary grounding, whereas the\nsinking in 1994 of the Samsun Brave resulted in the tragic loss of 10 lives plus the material loss\nof vessel and cargo. A conservative estimate of the total cost of all 13 incidents is K5.1 million\n($1.785 million). This equates to an average annual cost of approximately K0.64 million ($0.22\nmillion) per year.\n21. In practice, the available maritime incident records reviewed represent only a small\nfraction of total incidents occurring throughout PNG from 1991 to 1998. It therefore follows that\nthe incidents (13 incidents) and the associated annual cost of K0.64 million attributable to\nnavigation aids deficiency of navigation aids (Table A16.2) are also grossly underestimated.\n72\nAlso, the sample does not take into account the potential for a large maritime accident, such as\na passenger ferry or oil tanker sinking, both of which could result in major economic costs and\ntragic human and environmental losses. Conversely, it can be argued that not all of the 13\n                                                       \n3  Source: Shipping incident records of Lloyds.", "73\nAppendix 16, page 6\nincidents analyzed can be directly attributable to deficiencies of the navigation aids. In other\nwords, even if the navigation aids system as proposed is not installed and functioning correctly,\na number of these incidents could still occur.\n22. The  net  effect  therefore  is  that  there  have  most  likely  been  a  greater  number  of\naccidents  than  those  analyzed,  which  were  in  some  way  attributable  to  navigation  aids\ndeficiency, but that a proportion of those accidents would have occurred anyway, regardless of\nsystem effectiveness. For the purposes of analysis, it is assumed that the projected loss of\nK0.64 million ($0.22 million) annually is a realistic estimate of cost due primarily to navigation\naids system deficiency. This forms the basis of the economic benefit relating to maritime safety\nof the project proposals.\n3. Economic Analysis of New Channels\n23. Two  new  routes  will  be  established under  the  Project:  (i)  Nuakata  Channel to the\nsoutheast of the mainland and on the heavily traveled route between Port Moresby and Lae;\nand (ii) Nessup Channel, to the west of West New Britain and on the route between Lae and\nKimbe and Rabaul. The first links major ports on the mainland, and the latter links a major port\non the mainland with two busy ports on New Britain Island.  The new routes were endorsed by\nthe Navigation Aids Advisory Committee (NAAC).\n24. Nuakata  channel  would  serve  as  an  alternative  to  Raven  Channel  for  vessels\nproceeding between Port Moresby and Lae. A survey of the area conducted by the Royal\nAustralian Navy in 1991 indicates that the channel is relatively free from navigational hazards.\nThe recommended navigation aids include (i) new Hibwa light with a range of 10 nautical miles\n(nm) on the southern tip of Hibwa Reef, (ii) a 10-mile light with Racon on Badila-Dadubona, (iii)\na 5 mile-light and radar reflector on Bagshaw Patch, (iv) a 5-mile light and radar reflector\nNuakata West Spit, (v) radar reflector on northeast Hawki Hawki Shoal, (vi) a radar reflector on\nGypsy Shoal, and (vii) radar reflector on Nibor Reef. These aides will provide good visual aid\ncoverage of the channel and a radar beacon will assist mariners to locate the southern entry\npoint.\n25. The new channel (i) will be a significantly safer route than the passage through Raven\nChannel, (ii) is a significantly shorter (165 nm) route than the alternative safe passage via\nJomard Strait; and (iii) lighting will provide a nighttime alternative passage for vessels in transit\nfrom Port Moresby to Lae and return. A minimum of 400 commercial vessel movements occur\nbetween Port Moresby and Lae per year. Under the assumptions that (i) 70 percent of traffic\nnow avoids Raven Channel and adopts the longer safer route; (ii) approximately 280 vessel\nmovements at an average saving of 165 nautical miles would result from the use of Nuakata\nChannel; (iii) the average service speed of vessels is 10 knots; and (iv) the average economic\noperating cost of a vessel of the size and class that typically use the strait is K10,000 per day\n(K416 per hour), the total annual benefit of the route to shipowners is K1.9 million per annum.4\n26. Nessup Channel is an alternative route for vessels proceeding between Lae and the\nNew  Britain  ports  (Kimbe  and  Rabaul).  This  is  a  significant  coastal  route  used  by  both\npassenger ferries and commercial cargo vessels. The following aids are proposed: (i) a pile with\nradar reflector on the shoal adjacent to Nessup Island, (ii) a light with range 10 nautical miles on\nNessup Island with red, white, and green sectors to the south, (iii) a 4-mile port hand (red) light\nand radar reflector on northwest Shoal, (iv) a 4-mile light starboard hand (green) light and radar\n                                                       \n4 Direct vessel operating costs = 280*(165/10) = 4,620 hours saved per year, or K1.9 million per annum.", "74\nAppendix 16, page 7\nreflector on southeast Shoal, (v) a light with range 10 nm on Cape Gloucester Reef to mark off-\nlying dangers on the route from Nessup Channel to Kimbe. This regime of aids will provide good\nvisual aid coverage of the channel and facilitate its use at night.\n27. Nessup Channel (i) is a significantly shorter route between Lae and Kimbe Rabaul; (ii)\nfeatures fixed structures marking the channel, which will overcome the lower reliability inherent\nwith the buoy that is currently the only aid in the vicinity, and thus improve safety; and (iii) will\nenable night passage for vessels that currently use the longer route around Umboi Island during\nhours of darkness. A minimum of 300 commercial vessel movements occur between Lae and\nthe North Coast of New Britain per year. Under the assumptions that (i) 90 percent of traffic now\navoids Nessup Channel adopting the longer route around Umboi Island; (ii) approximately 270\nvessel movements at an average saving of 46 nm would result from the use of Nessup Channel;\n(iii) the average service speed of commercial vessels is 10 knots; and (iv) the average economic\noperating cost of a vessel of the size and class that typically use the strait is K10,000 per day\n(K416 per hour), the total annual benefit of the route to shipowners is K0.52 million per annum.5\nD. Hydrographic Services\n28. The Project establishes a national hydrographic service and a PNG hydrographic office\n(PNGHO) within the Department of Transport and Civil Aviation (DOTCA) and later with the\nmaritime safety authority (MSA). This will enable the PNGHO to carry out a full range of marine\nsurvey,  database  management, and  maritime  navigational  charting  functions,  and  produce\naccurate nautical charts beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001. Chart production is maintained\nat a steady rate, allowing the PNGHO to address charting priorities in PNG waters by the end of\nthe project period (2006). Apart from enhancing general maritime safety in PNG coastal waters,\nthere are a number of areas of national interest in which a strengthened charting capability\nwould play an important role, some carry significant economic benefits.\n1.  Marine Boundary Delineation\n29. Most  of  the  existing  nautical  charts  of  PNG\u2019s  coastline  are  old,  inaccurate,  and\ninconsistent with GPS satellite data. In particular, the precise boundaries of PNG\u2019s 12-mile limit\nand its 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are not known. The relevant charts needed to\ndepict these boundaries, produced using varying methods, are not consistent with reference\npoints. As a result, it is not possible to determine the location of these boundaries to enable\nprosecution  of  foreign  vessels  that  may  be  infringing  PNG\u2019s  rights  in  these  waters.  With\nassistance from the Forum Fisheries Agency in Honiara, the PNG National Mapping Bureau is\nconducting a study of the relevant charts to  define  areas  of  survey  needs to  identify the\nboundaries and reference points. A strengthened PNGHO is vital to carrying out these surveys\nand producing the updated boundary charts.\n2.  Offshore Minerals and Petroleum Prospecting\n30. Precise locations are clearly required for offshore prospecting activities. Prospecting\ncompanies carry out their own seismic surveys, which produce data on depths and seabed\ncontours,  as  well  as  on  the  underlying  rock  strata.6  A  comprehensive  set  of  accurate\nhydrographic charts would assist in the initial identification of prospecting sites, and would be of\n                                                       \n5\nDirect vessel operating costs = 270*(46/10) = 1,242 hours per year saved or K0.52 million per annum.\n6 Considerable quantity of seismic data collected by prospecting companies is filed by the Department of Petroleum\nand Energy. These would provide additional data input for charting work of the PNGHO.", "75\nAppendix 16, page 8\nsignificant benefit in the resource development stage, when precise siting of drilling platforms\nand  associated equipment over a  relatively  large  offshore  area  is  required.  A  full-fledged\nPNGHO would fill a useful role in supporting prospecting and development, and lowering the\nrelated costs. In particular, it is envisaged that the PNGHO will perform as a  commercial\ncontractor  to  prospecting  companies  for  specialized  surveying  and  charting  to  support\ndevelopment  of  identified  prospects.  Such  contracting  would  provide  promising  additional\nfinancial revenues to support the PNGHO. These services are currently being contracted from\nforeign  entities.  Such  surveying  and  charting  will  be  required  to  support  major  national\ndevelopments in the future.\n3.  Fisheries\n31. The emerging local fishing industry is mainly long-liner fishing for sashimi-grade tuna\nwithin PNG\u2019s exclusive economic zone. At present, 34 locally owned long-liner boats exist, each\nwith an average of 10 crew, with an annual catch valued at about $30 million.7 All long-line\nboats carry GPS for identification and recording the precise location of fishing equipment. Most\nof the fisheries are located within a few hundred nm of Port Moresby to ensure international\nairfreight connections.\n32. Most hydrographic charts used by the long-liners around Port Moresby are outdated and\nhave been corrected on an ad hoc basis by the ships\u2019 captains, using their GPS. Potential new\nfishing grounds exist in long stretches of unsurveyed waters on the north coast of the PNG\nmainland. Expanding the fishery to these waters is constrained by (i) the lack of surveys and\naccurate charts, and (ii) greater distance from international air freight connections. Despite\nthese constraints, a small amount of long-line fishing does occur on the north coast, with the\ncatches shipped by air from Lae to Port Moresby. The main difficulty is the very large areas of\nunsurveyed coastline in the potential new areas. The PNGHO would materially assist expansion\nof the long-line tuna fish industry. While long-line fishing remains constrained by air freight, new\nfishing grounds can be opened in the currently unsurveyed waters on the north coast.\n33. The  potential  for  expanding  the  fishing  industry  is  constrained  by  the  lack  of\nhydrographic information needed for assessing the catch potential in these waters. However, a\ncertain degree of commercial potential can be assumed due to the large extent of unsurveyed\nwaters. The current landing value of the catch is $30  million annually. As a  conservative\nestimate of potential benefits from accurate charting of the entire unsurveyed portions of the\nnorth coast, a 10 percent increase in long-line fishing catch can be assumed through greater\nexploitation of the north coast waters. The economic benefit to the country of such an expansion\nwould be in the form of greater export earnings from the sale of fish, and greater employment\ngenerated by additional boats and downstream processing activities. Under the assumption that\nthe adjusted economic value of export earnings from a 10 percent increase in long-liner activity\n(and catch) is a minimum of $1.5 million (K3.75 million) per annum and extra employment for an\nestimated 40 workers (including downstream workers) is valued at K400,000 per annum, total\nestimated economic benefits associated with the fishery expansion induced by the production of\naccurate charts is K4.2 million per annum.\n                                                       \n7 For 340 mariners employed at K10,000/yr, the wage bill is K3.4 million. If employment is increased by 10 percent:\n(3 boats) 30 crew or 300,000/yr, not including downstream employment.", "76\nAppendix 16, page 9\n4.  Maritime Search and Rescue\n34. Maritime accidents happen regularly and frequently in PNG waters. These involve both\nlarge  commercial  ships  and  overloaded  small  craft.  The  Maritime  Search  and  Rescue\n(MARSAR) records report numerous stranded small craft that have capsized or ran out of fuel.\nMany of these accidents are resolved, but frequently the rescue efforts are severely hampered\nby inaccurate or imprecise information about accident location. This occurs usually even when\nthe distressed craft is able to report its GPS location as a consequence of inaccurate charts on\nwhich rescue authorities plot the location of the distressed vessel incorrectly. This significantly\nlengthens the search process, delays rescue, and sometimes has led to fatal consequences.\nTable A16.3 summarizes the most serious accidents recorded in 1998 and 1999.\nTable A16.3: Most Serious Vessel Accidents in 1998-1999\nDate Incident Casualties\n6 April 1998 Dive boat\u2014Cape Vogel, missing 1 dead\ndiver\n15 April 1998 Fishing vessel from Kiribati ran 2 dead\nout of fuel; drifted to Kavieng\n20 July 1998 MV Etotonga traveling to Kavieng, 30 passengers rescued by\nran aground and wrecked passing ship\n5 October 1998 A dinghy with 15 passengers was 7 dead\nstranded in bad weather near\nMadang\n6 October 1998 19 ft dinghy with 12 passengers, 1 dead, 6 missing\nfrom Oro Bay to Tufi\n10 June 1999 MV Kula with 81 passengers 36 dead\nenroute from Woodward to\nLosuia, capsized\n28 July 1999 MV China Steel Trader, ran Oil spill covered Vitiaz Strait\naground, spilling oil\n31 July 1999 FMV Nila 3, ran aground and Vessel sunk\nwrecked\n28 September 1999 Fishing boat, lost mariner 1 dead\n26 November 1999 MV Totol, Kimbe to Lae, person 1 dead\noverboard\n30 November 1999 FV San Andres, accident on 2 dead, several injured\nboard\n35. Accurate charts covering at least the coastal sectors most frequently used by small\ncraft\u2014large portions of which are currently unsurveyed\u2014would help to save lives by improving\nthe accuracy of the accident location. Fifty-one fatalities were recorded at sea during 1998 and\n1999. For this analysis, more accurate charts are assumed to shorten response time and be\nresponsible for saving at least two lives per year, the economic value of this benefit is K1.4\nmillion per annum.8\nE. Cost-Benefit Analysis\n36. The analysis is summarized in Table A16.4. It considers the economic project costs\n(capital and maintenance expenditures) in comparison with the economic benefits (improvement\nin transport efficiency, safety improvements, and improvements from improved survey data)\nover the planned 20-year period. Poverty-reducing benefits have not been included in the\n                                                       \n8 Based on an economic value per human life of K700,000 derived from productivity estimates.", "77\nAppendix 16, page 10\nanalysis and would augment the internal economic rate of return (EIRR).
