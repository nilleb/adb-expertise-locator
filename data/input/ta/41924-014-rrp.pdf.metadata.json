THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ndirect  loan  of  up to  $50  million;  (ii)  a  proposed  B  loan  of  up  to  $77  million funded from \nparticipating commercial banks; and (iii) a proposed direct loan of up to B3,040 million, all \nwithout government guarantee, to Nam Ngiep 1 Power Company Limited (NNP1PC) for the \nNam Ngiep 1 Hydropower Project in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Hydropower resources in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) are extensive, with an \nestimated  potential  capacity  of  30,000  megawatts  (MW). 2  However,  they  are  unevenly \ndistributed. Thailand, which has a large and growing power requirement, has limited hydropower \npotential and is dependent on natural gas which is depleting over time. The Lao PDR, on the \nother hand, has the largest hydropower potential in the region at 20,000 MW, but the smallest \ndomestic  demand.  The  GMS  countries  are  thus  promoting  power  trading  to  enable \ncomplementary access to cost-efficient energy resources. The Lao PDR plans to export up to \n7,000 MW of hydropower to Thailand and up to 5,000 MW to Viet Nam. \n \n3.  The Lao PDR, classified by the United Nations as a least developed country, has a \ngross domestic product per capita of $1,330 in 2013. The country aims to be out of the least \ndeveloped country category by 2020. The energy sector is critical to achieving this goal as \nelectric power is a vital source of export earnings.3 As of 2013, only 3,222 MW have been \ndeveloped. The government\u2019s target is to install an additional 9,300 MW of capacity by 2022. To \nachieve this, it must mobilize capital and technical capacity through partnerships with the private \nsector. \n \n4.  The  project  is  one  such  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP),  to  be  implemented  with \ninvestment risks and capital shared with the private sector. After attempts by some international \npartners to  develop  the  project  in  the  1990s, the  Japan International  Cooperation  Agency \nthrough Nippon Koei conducted a feasibility study during 1998\u20132002. The study confirmed the \nfeasibility of the project on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer basis and recommended a development \nplan based on optimal physical, economic, and safeguard considerations. The government and \nNippon Koei executed an agreement in May 2003 for development of the project. Kansai \nElectric  Power  (Kansai)  joined  and  executed  the  project  development  agreement  with  the \ngovernment in April 2006. Subsequently, Nippon Koei sold its stake in the project and Electricity \nGenerating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) joined as the third developer. \n \n5.  In  January  2007,  Kansai,  EGAT,  and  the  government  (together,  the  sponsors) \napproached ADB for assistance with the project, based on the prominent role ADB played in \n                                                             \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The GMS countries are Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet \nNam. \n3  Export of power generated around 21% of the Lao PDR\u2019s total export receipts in 2013. ", "2  \nearlier Lao PDR hydropower projects.4 The sponsors asked ADB to provide financing and \nguidance  on  the  environment  and  social  preparation  to  ensure  that  the  project  would  be \nimplemented sustainably and compliant with international best practices. After more than four \nyears of project development involving tariff negotiation with EGAT, as off-taker, and a search \nfor  credible  and  competitive  construction  contractors,  the  sponsors  executed  the  tariff \nagreement with EGAT on 12 July 2011 and the project was confirmed for start-up in 2019. \n \n2.  Project Design \n6.  The project involves construction and operation, on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer basis, of a \n290 MW hydroelectric power generation facility, on the Nam Ngiep River, in the provinces of \nBolikhamxay and Xaysomboun. The dam site is 145 kilometers (km) northeast of Vientiane. 5 It \nhas three major components: \n(i)  a main power station (272 MW) with a concrete gravity dam (height 148 meters) \nand  a  reservoir  (surface  area  67  square  kilometers),  with  effective  storage \ncapacity  of  1.2  billion  cubic  meters;  electricity  produced  will  be  exported  to \nThailand; \n(ii)  a  reregulation  power  station  (18  MW)  with  a  concrete  gravity  dam  (height  \n21 meters) and a reregulating reservoir (surface area 1.3 square kilometers), with \neffective storage capacity of 4.6 million cubic meters; electricity produced will be \nsupplied within the Lao PDR;6 and \n(iii)  a 125 km 230-kilovolt (kV) transmission line to connect the main power station to \nthe Nabong substation near Vientiane. \n \n7.  The Nabong substation is already connected to the Udon-Thani substation in Thailand \nby a double-circuit transmission line. The Nam Ngum 2 (NN2) hydropower project installed the \nLao PDR side of this transmission line and EGAT installed the line on the Thai side. It is \ncurrently energized at 230 kV and transmits NN2\u2019s power to Thailand. NN2 will upgrade the \nsubstation by the time of NNP1PC\u2019s interconnection, and the transmission line will then be \nenergized at 500 kV. The government through Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EDL) will purchase these \nfacilities from NN2 for integration into the national grid. After the transfer, NNP1PC and NN2 will \nenter into an interconnection agreement with EDL and pay wheeling charges for use of the \nfacilities. EDL will engage EGAT to operate and maintain the Nabong facilities. \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n8.  The sponsors established NNP1PC as a special-purpose company to implement the \nproject. The shareholders are Kansai through KPIC Netherlands B.V. (KPIC) with 45%, EGAT \nthrough EGAT International (EGATi) 30%, and the government through Lao Holding State \nEnterprise (LHSE) 25%. \n \n9.  Kansai is the second largest of the nine major power utilities in Japan. The company has \n167 power plants with a total generating capacity of 34,958 MW (of which 151 hydropower \nplants provide 8,208 MW). Outside of Japan, Kansai owns 1,106 MW of generating capacity, \n                                                             \n4  ADB. 1994.

Manila. \n5  The Nam Ngiep River is a tributary of the Mekong River. \n6  The project will evacuate power for domestic supply through a 40 km 115 kV transmission line that will connect the \nreregulation power station to the existing 115 kV Pakxan substation. This transmission line will be installed by EDL \nand is not part of the project. ", "  3\nincluding the 345 MW San Roque hydropower plant in the Philippines, the 218 MW Rojana gas-\nfired power plant in Thailand, and the 3,300 MW Sonoko gas-fired power plant in Singapore. \nKansai is coursing its investment into NNP1PC through its wholly owned investment vehicle \nKPIC. Kansai has a long-term debt rating of A3 from Moody\u2019s. KPIC is not rated. \n \n10.  EGAT is Thailand\u2019s largest electricity generator with installed capacity of 15,010 MW \n(including 3,436 MW of hydropower), representing 46% of the country\u2019s installed capacity.7 \nEGAT is investing in the project through its wholly owned subsidiary EGATi, established to \nexpand  EGAT\u2019s  activities  in  neighboring  countries.  The  project  is  EGAT\u2019s  first  direct \ninternational investment and is part of its strategy to invest about $3 billion in Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, and Myanmar through EGATi and other channels. EGAT was rated BBB+ by Standard & \nPoor\u2019s until June 2013, but is currently not rated by any agency. EGATi is not rated. \n \n11.  LHSE is the holding company established by the government to own and manage equity \ninvestments in power projects. Since Nam Theun 2 was commissioned in April 2010, LHSE has \nstarted receiving regular dividend revenue. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact  \n12.  Increased  regional  cooperation.  The  project  will  contribute  to  increased  regional \ncooperation between the Lao PDR and Thailand through the trade of clean energy. The Lao \nPDR has limited opportunities for trade and economic growth but has a very large hydropower \npotential that can be harnessed to generate foreign exchange revenues. Thailand, on the other \nhand, has a strong and growing economy, but this growth is at risk due to the country\u2019s heavy \nreliance on its dwindling natural gas reserves.  \n \n13.  Increased electrification rate. The project will provide 18 MW of capacity for domestic \nsupply and help the Lao PDR reach its target of increasing the electrification rate from 82% to \n92% by 2024. While electrification of 82% is not low among its GMS peers,8 provincial rates in \nthe Lao PDR range as low 33%. The country\u2019s power demand per capita is also low at 402 kWh \nper year.9 \n \n14.  Promotion of environmentally and socially sustainable private sector investment. \nThe Lao PDR does not have the financial or technical resources to effectively monetize its \nhydropower potential and, hence, must partner with the private sector for financing and capacity \nbuilding. Following the success of earlier private sector hydropower projects, the Lao PDR has \nin recent years attracted significant new investments in hydropower. However, affected people \nand civil society are increasingly raising concerns that projects are implemented without due \nconsideration  of  environment  and  social  impacts.  By  contrast,  the  project,  under  ADB\u2019s \nguidance, has been prepared to reflect the best international practice in controlling impacts, in \nparticular impacts from involuntary resettlement. The success of the project will demonstrate \nthat socially responsible investment is not incompatible with financially sound business and will \n                                                             \n7  EGAT also buys electricity from other generators: 12,742 MW from Thai independent power producers, 2,445 MW \nfrom Thai small power producers, and 2,405 MW from neighboring countries (including 2,105 MW from the Lao \nPDR). \n8  The electrification rates in neighboring countries (2011) are 34% in Cambodia, 48% in Myanmar, 70% in the \nPhilippines, 96% in Viet Nam, and 99% in Thailand. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS \n9  Annual per capita electricity consumption in neighboring countries (2011) is 164 kWh in Cambodia, 110 kWh in \nMyanmar, 647 kWh in the Philippines, 1,073 kWh in Viet Nam, and 2,316 kWh in Thailand. http://www.gms-\neoc.org/gms-statistics/overview/electricity-consumption-per-capita \n ", "4  \nencourage more responsible private sector investment into infrastructure development in the \ncountry.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n15.  The outcome will be increased private sector provision of reliable and clean power to \nThailand and the Lao PDR. The outcome will be measured, among others, by the amount of \nelectricity  delivered;  greenhouse  gas  emissions  avoided  in  Thailand;  and  cash  revenues \nreceived by the Government of the Lao PDR in dividends, royalties, and taxes from the project. \n \n3.  Outputs \n16.  The  project\u2019s  outputs  will  be  (i)  a  290  MW  hydropower  plant  completed  in  an \nenvironmentally and socially sustainable manner, (ii) economic benefits to the Lao PDR, and  \n(iii) development of local government capacity in environment and social protection. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n17.  Strategy 2020. The midterm review of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 reaffirmed infrastructure \ndevelopment, regional cooperation and integration, and private sector development as three of \nthe strategic priorities.10 As a PPP cross-border power plant to provide infrastructure essential \nfor private sector development, the project is fully consistent with the midterm review of Strategy \n2020. \n \n18.  Regional strategy. The regional cooperation strategy and program for the GMS has a \nvision  of  a  prosperous,  integrated,  and  harmonious  subregion  achieved  through  regional \ncooperation  that  promotes  economic  growth,  environmental  sustainability,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and capacity development. 11 The project will be a good example of mutually \nbeneficial regional cooperation through EGAT\u2019s investment and through trading of power. \n \n19.  Country strategy. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for the Lao PDR \nfocuses on promoting pro-poor sustainable growth including through regional power trading.12 \nThe project will generate revenues for the country and employment, and improve workers\u2019 skills \nthrough the transfer of technical and safeguard knowledge. The project will provide community \ninfrastructure, which will have economic multiplier effects. \n \n20.  Sector strategy. ADB\u2019s Energy Policy emphasizes renewable energy, access to energy, \nand capacity building. 13 The project is consistent with the policy as it will provide Thailand with \nan additional renewable energy source, increase the power supply to the Lao PDR, and provide \nbest practice in the implementation of a hydropower plant. \n \n21.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  A  key  finding  from  ADB\u2019s  2010  independent \nreview of the Lao PDR energy sector assistance indicates the government lacks the capacity to \nmanage  environmental  and  social  impacts.14Further  interventions  for  capacity  building  are \n                                                             \n10 ADB. 2014.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n23.  ADB proposes to provide (i) a direct loan of up to $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources; (ii) a B loan of up to $77 million funded by participating international commercial \nbanks; and (iii) a baht-denominated direct loan of up to B3,040 million (or its equivalent in \ndollars if baht are not available) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n24.  The  development  of  hydropower  resources  as  an  export  commodity  is  a  critical \ncomponent  of the government\u2019s  strategy to  achieve  its  poverty  reduction  goal.  Substantial \nfinancing from the private sector is required to build these projects. However, the international \nbanking community perceives inherent risks in financing such projects without the involvement \n ", "6  \nof  development-focused  international  financial  institutions  such  as  ADB.  Through  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation, these banks find confidence to co-lend because the project will be financed in a \nstructurally sound manner and will comply with high environment and social standards. The \nnature of the project (i.e., long construction period, high up-front capital expenditure, competitive \ntariffs, long asset life, and revenue contracts) requires long-tenor debt to match its cash flow \nprofile. ADB will mobilize long-tenor debt from the commercial banks and will play a crucial role \nin ensuring the financial viability of the project. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the project is categorized A for \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people;  and  as  highly  complex  and \nsensitive.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks  of  the  project  and  its \nassociated facilities were identified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and \ncompensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard plans.  \n \n26.  Key environmental impacts are associated with the inundation of 68 square kilometers of \nterrestrial  and  riverine  habitats.  Specialist  experts  conducted  biodiversity  studies  in  the \ninundation zone and surrounding areas in 2007, 2013, and 2014.15 Residual impacts will include \n(i) permanent loss of 3,944 hectares of natural habitat and 3,549 hectares of modified habitat; \n(ii) alteration of aquatic habitat; and (iii) a limited loss of habitat for threatened species.16 \nAssessments indicate, however, that the project area is not a critical habitat for any species, \nand a comprehensive program of mitigation, management, and biodiversity offsets are planned. \nThe biodiversity offset program aims to ensure no net loss of biodiversity consistent with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement and will include establishment of watershed management program \nand conservation area for the forested and riverine areas of the Nam Ngiep River; and species \nspecific conservation measures in the Nam Ngiep watershed and other sites. Special attention \nwill  be  given  to  an  endangered  fish  species,  the  giant  pike  carp  (Lucioprynus  striolatus), \nincluding monitoring and protection of habitat and support for a species recovery program.  \n \n27.  The environmental management plan also provides measures for advanced warning for \ndownstream hydrological changes and management of riverbank erosion during operations. \nNNP1PC\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage its environmental and social risks \nare  deemed  adequate. Information  disclosure and  consultations  with  affected  people  were \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements. NNP1PC has allocated a sufficient budget for \nimplementation of environmental and social plans. As this is a highly complex and sensitive \nproject,  an  independent  advisory  panel  is  monitoring  the  project  and NNP1PC  will  submit \nquarterly monitoring reports on the implementation of environmental management plan. \n \n28.  NNP1PC  prepared  a  resettlement  and  ethnic  development  plan  to  address  direct \nimpacts on 432 households requiring relocation and an additional estimated 561 households \nlosing only land for project facilities, including access roads and the 230 kV transmission line. \nThe Hmong ethnic communities living in five villages, which are among those directly affected, \n                                                             \n15 Surveys were supplemented by village interviews, desk reviews, and geospatial datasets. \n16 Threatened species directly or indirectly recorded in the project area include plant species: (1 critically endangered, \n7 endangered,  and 5 vulnerable); mammal species (1 critically endangered, 7 endangered); bird species (1 \ncritically endangered, 2 endangered); reptile species (2 endangered); amphibian species (none); and aquatic \nspecies (1 critically endangered, 5 endangered).

POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nPoverty targeting: General intervention  \nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe project is located in three districts classified as among the poorest in the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR) and as the focus of poverty reduction efforts under the National Seventh Five-Year National Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. The project is aligned with the plan\u2019s designation of energy and mining \nas a strategic sector. Development in the power subsector is focused on using, developing, and expanding \nhydropower sources for environment-friendly energy; and expansion of lines to meet the twin objectives of supplying \nelectricity domestically for the country\u2019s development and export.a The development of the energy sector will \ngenerate income for the government to spend on socioeconomic development. The country partnership strategy of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Lao PDR focuses on promoting pro-poor sustainable growth, including \nthrough power trading and rural electrification.  \nB. Results from the Poverty and Social Analysis during PPTA or Due Diligence  \n1. Key poverty and social issues. The Lao PDR\u2019s recent economic growth reduced poverty incidence from 46% in \n1992 to 27% in 2008. However, poverty remains high and is predominantly rural. In the districts where the project \nwill be implemented, the percentage of households classified as poor ranges from Thathom with 55%, Hom with \n57%, and Bolikhan with 76%. This is due to accessibility difficulties and higher proportion of ethnic groups. Poverty \nincidence among ethnic minorities is higher (40%\u201355%) than among the majority Lao-Tai population (29%). The \nproject will generate about $600 million of government revenues, which may be used for socioeconomic programs. \nThus poor communities elsewhere will indirectly benefit from poverty reduction; expenditures in health, education, \nrural roads, and environment; and rural electrification.  \n2. Beneficiaries. The project will contribute to economic growth, poverty reduction, job creation, and improvement of \nelectricity supply in the project impact zones. Construction will directly employ about 1,800, with many more jobs \nexpected from support services and provision of food and agricultural products to construction workers.  \n3. Impact channels. The project has undertaken a comprehensive social analysis, and prepared a resettlement and \nethnic development plan (REDP) and a social development plan (SDP) comprising (i) a public health action plan \n(PHAP), (ii) a labor management plan (LMP), and (iii) a community development plan (CDP). Benefits of the project \nwill  be  directly  delivered  to  the  affected  people  through  these  plans.  In  addition,  the  project  will  generate \nemployment  opportunities  and  prioritize  local  labor.  At  the  macro  level,  the  project  will  contribute  about  \n$600 million income to the government, which will be useful in implementing national socioeconomic programs that \nare expected to benefit the whole population. \n4. Other social and poverty issues. Programs jointly implemented by government line agencies and civil society \norganizations (CSOs) and funded by international development partners will address concerns on public health, \neducation, human resource development, wildlife conservation, deforestation, and human trafficking. \n5. Design features. Measures in the REDP are designed to double the incomes of affected people in real terms and \nbring all directly affected poor and vulnerable households above the poverty line within 10 years of plant startup. \nThe PHAP will implement programs on community health in the resettlement area, general community health \nimprovement in the project impact zones, capacity building for village health volunteers and district health office \nstaff, water supply and sanitation program, and a special social management and mitigation plan for camp followers. \nConstruction-related public health impacts are addressed through contractors\u2019 obligations regarding minimizing \ndust, noise and air pollutants, and traffic safety. The LMP comprises measures to ensure adherence to national \nlabor laws and core labor standards, policy on contractors and other providers of goods and services, policy for \nlocal labor recruitment, skills training for local residents, community management and infrastructure development, \nhuman trafficking impacts and management, conflict resolution, and strategy and measures for employees and \nworkers\u2019 health. The CDP focuses on aspects that could help improve the community as a whole, and lift up the \nquality of life, living standards, and income of affected people, complementing other programs described here and in \nthe REDP. It comprises the gender action plan, programs for youth and children, and a cultural awareness and \nheritage preservation program.  \n \n   ", "  11 \n   \nII.  PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERING THE POOR \n1. Participatory approaches. During a feasibility study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, three national \nconsultations were conducted during 1998\u20131999 and six local consultations in 1999. Since 2008, the project \nconducted  at  least  50  consultations,  including  joint  site  visits  with  villagers  in  the  impact  zones  and  local \ngovernments. The perspectives of local residents and governments have been considered, resulting in changes to \nthe project design including the location of the resettlement site, alterations to livelihood programs, and reduction of \nthe maximum reservoir level. In May 2014, the project conducted consultations with CSOs, international agencies, \nprovincial and district government agencies, and affected people. Continued consultations will be undertaken by the \nproject. A grievance mechanism is in place to address feedback and concerns throughout construction and \noperation. \n2. Civil society\u2019s role. CSOs and international agencies were consulted on the safeguards mitigation plans.  \n3. Explain how the project ensures adequate participation of CSOs in project implementation? The project will work \nwith CSOs to implement the SDP and has identified CSOs dealing with health, HIV/AIDS, people with disabilities, \neducation, environment, programs for youth and children, cultural awareness, and heritage preservation. CSOs \nidentified include Handicap International, Action with Lao Children, Action for Women in Distressing Circumstances, \nPestalozzi Children's Foundation, World Wildlife Fund, Save the Children Norway, and World Education/Consortium \nin the Lao PDR. \n4. Civil society organization participation envisaged during the project: \nM    Information gathering and sharing    M Consultation     Collaboration     Partnership \n5. Participation plan.  Yes. A public consultation and participation program is included in the REDP. Poor and \nvulnerable households have been identified, and special measures will be implemented to mitigate impacts and \nenhance their well-being. Key features include an adult literacy program, housing adaptation for disabled, and year-\nround food security. Social development and community consultation teams have been formed by the project to \nimplement these measures. \nIII.   GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT \nGender mainstreaming category: Some gender elements  \nA. Key issues. Women head about 8% of households in affected villages. Key issues include (i) high illiteracy of \nethnic minority women; (ii) women\u2019s and girls\u2019 poor health, particularly due to heavy physical workloads, frequent \npregnancies, poor hygiene and sanitation, and limited health facilities; (iii) livelihoods, and different roles of men and \nwomen in the domestic economy of affected households; and (iv) low status given to girls, raising the risk of girls \nbeing sold as domestic or sex workers by parents. Five villages and a hamlet affected by the reservoir are inhabited \nby Hmong ethnic minority. Hmong culture is patrilineal and patriarchal and does not permit women to inherit or co-\nown land and property. Moreover, during construction, an influx of migrant workers may pose potential risks of \nHIV/STDs and trafficking of children and women.  \nB.  Key  actions.  As  women  from  ethnic  groups  and  vulnerable  households  are  more  disadvantaged  and \noverburdened than others, a gender action plan was prepared as part of the SDP. It provides for separate \nconsultations with women, compensation payments, land and property title in names of husband and wife, second \nwives entitled to separate titles in their names, maternal and nutrition health programs, women's adult literacy \nprogram, and livelihood and skills training programs. Examples of specific targets include 40% of scholarships \nreserved for girls; 100% of land titles to be issued in joint spousal names; for households with a husband and more \nthan one wife, 100% land titles for properties of second and third wives to be issued in wife's name and the name of \nanother family member, to be chosen by the wife; 100% of bank books to be opened in the names of both husband \nand wife; and at least one woman in every affected household to be involved in livelihood training activities. \n         Gender action plan        Other actions or measures        No action or measure \nIV.   ADDRESSING SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES \nA. Involuntary Resettlement   Safeguard Category:    A      B       C       FI \n1. Key impacts. The project will relocate 432 households from six villages and one hamlet, which will all be \ninundated. In addition, another 561 households from 31 villages will have other direct impacts, i.e. 163 households \nfrom three villages in the upper reservoir area will lose a considerable part of their low-lying agricultural land; 117 \nhouseholds from 2 villages will  share resources with the resettled community; and another 281 households from 26 \nvillages will lose a small portion of their arable lands or temporary access to lands due to the construction of the 230 \nkilovolt transmission line and access roads. \n2. Strategy to address the impacts. The project will provide replacement land and housing or cash compensation for \nall affected people. Livelihood restoration support will be implemented. The project\u2019s social management office \nincludes ethnic Hmong staff responsible for resettlement infrastructure development, social preparation, public \nhealth, labor management, compensation, livelihood restoration, and monitoring and documentation. The project \nhas established a grievance redress mechanism, which allows affected people to raise concerns and grievances in  \na transparent manner. If the project\u2019s mediation and reaction do not lead to a successful conclusion, affected people \n ", "12 \ncan file a grievance with the village, district, and/or provincial grievance redress committees.  \n3. Plan or other actions.    Combined resettlement and indigenous peoples plan \nB. Indigenous Peoples  Safeguard Category:    A      B       C       FI \n1. Key impacts. Affected households are mainly from Hmong and Lao ethnic groups. Five Hmong villages will be \nrequired to relocate.  \nIs broad community support (BCS) triggered?    Yes. BCS has been obtained from the ethnic Hmong communities \nin zone 2 lower reservoir and zone 3 construction area. Meaningful consultations have been conducted in these \ncommunities  since  2008,  including  exploring  options  to  avoid  or  minimize  involuntary  resettlement  impacts; \nevaluating various resettlement sites; and discussing compensation and potential livelihood restoration measures, \nresettlement site lay-out, and house designs. In 2013 and 2014, the project conducted good faith negotiations with \nthe Hmong communities, which have resulted in (i) larger land allocation in Houay Soup; (ii) culturally sensitive \nvillage lay-out and house design, relocation timeline for graveyards, and development benefits such as scholarships \nand community development fund; and (iii) the option of self-relocation with cash compensation plus livelihood \nsupport before and after resettlement for those relocating within the project influence zones. The project has \nimplemented a pilot soil improvement program at Houay Soup in cooperation with zone 3 affected people, to \nencourage more  people  to move  to  Houay  Soup  where  the project  believes  there  is  higher  probability  for \nsustainable livelihoods, higher standards of living, better community infrastructure, and, therefore, better outcomes \nfor the affected people.  \n2. Strategy to address the impacts. Project activities and benefits have been structured in a culturally appropriate \nway, and good faith negotiations undertaken to address differing views of households in various villages. Male and \nfemale Hmong staff have been employed to ensure comprehensive consultation. The REDP addresses the \nconcerns of all affected people, a significant number of which are Hmong. The SDP is intended to mitigate impacts \nand promote social development in the project area. These plans were designed in consultation with the ethnic \nHmong communities to encourage their participation, commitment, and ownership to ensure their sustainable \nimplementation. \n3.

Labor market impact. During construction, about 1,800 workers will be engaged. An influx of foreign and local \nmigrant workers is expected. The LMP includes a code of conduct mandatory for project and contractor staff, \ncompliance  with  the  national  labor  law,  and measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core labor \nstandards. \nB. Affordability The project will provide power to the grid and does not involve direct selling to the people. \nC. Communicable Diseases and Other Social Risks  \n1. M  Communicable diseases   L  Human trafficking      Others (please specify) ______________ \n2. Risks to people in project area. The PHAP was prepared to anticipate, avoid, and mitigate any social and health \nimpacts due to relocation of households, impacts on host communities, and influx of migrant workers and camp \nfollowers. \nVI.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n1. Targets and indicators. The following indicators are included: standards of living of 100% of poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds affected by involuntary resettlement are brought to at least national minimum standards 10 years after \nthe plant\u2019s start-up, issuance of 100% of replacement land titles in joint spousal names, 40% of postsecondary \nscholarships reserved for ethnic Hmong girls, at least 500 Lao workers employed during construction, and about 80 \nLao workers employed during operation.   \n2. Required human resources. The project\u2019s social management office has about 35 staff to implement and monitor \nthe REDP and SDP.  \n3. Information in the project administration manual. Not applicable. \n4. Monitoring tools. ADB will conduct periodic site visits and review monitoring reports. An external expert will \nmonitor implementation of the REDP and SDP. The project is considered to be highly complex and sensitive, hence, \nan independent advisory panel has been appointed to monitor management of the environmental and social \nsafeguards and other social dimensions of the project during design and implementation.  \na  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. 2011.
