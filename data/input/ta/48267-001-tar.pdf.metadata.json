INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  To utilize its mineral-driven trade expansion for development, Mongolia has acceded to \nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) (1997), and negotiated several trade and investment \narrangements with various trading partners. The objective is to facilitate economic diversification, \nincrease employment, and improve overall household purchasing power. Yet, despite these \nefforts to integrate itself into the global economy, Mongolia still faces trade impediments. \n \n2.  A  key  constraint  is  the  absence  of  a  national  trade  policy.  Without  a  trade  policy \nframework, frequent shifts in government policies and priorities have caused confusion for \nMongolia\u2019s  trading  partners.1 Responsibility  for  trade-related  policies  has  been  frequently \nreassigned from one government agency to another, most recently in October 2014. This lack of \ninstitutional stability and policy clarity not only makes planning difficult for traders, but also has \nnegative  impacts  on  bureaucratic  capacity  (staff  retention  rates  in  government  agencies \nresponsible for trade policy management have decreased because of frequent reassignment of \nthis function from one ministry to another, inhibiting career development). The difficulty with staff \nretention was cited as a reason why little action was taken in response to a recommendation to \ndesign a trade policy, emanating from Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) \nto  support  the  WTO  trade  policy  review  process. 2  Mongolia\u2019s  comprehensive  national \ndevelopment strategy, adopted by Parliament in early 2008, identifies two strategic objectives to \ncreate a favorable foreign trade environment, but if they are to be realized, these aspirations \nrequire further elaboration.3 \n \n3.  Mongolia recognizes these issues and, in response, seeks to design a trade policy for \nparliamentary ratification. The intent is to add stability, develop capacity, and enshrine a long-\nterm view that will reduce the trade deficit and catalyze trade diversification and expansion. In \nApril 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development presented ADB with a draft TA concept note \nseeking  support  for  designing  an  international  trade  policy  (ITP).  The  2\u20134  June  2014  TA \nreconnaissance  mission  to  Ulaanbaatar  reviewed,  discussed,  and revised the TA  proposal \ntogether with the Ministry of Economic Development.4 The mission also consulted with other \nstakeholders  and  possible  contributors.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  secured  the \ngovernment's concurrence with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for Mongolia, 2014\u20132016.5 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.6 \n \n                                                \n1  World Trade Organization. 2014. Trade Policy Review: Mongolia. 24 and 26 September. Concluding remarks by \nthe chairperson. Geneva. \n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Trade Policy Review. Manila (TA 3934-MON). As noted in the \nSeptember 2008 country assistance program evaluation, capacity limitations (caused largely by high rates of staff \nturnover in the civil service) and reluctance to pursue integration proactively with the People\u2019s Republic of China \nand Russia inhibited Mongolia\u2019s follow-through on TA recommendations. \n3  State Great Hural (Parliament) of Mongolia. 2008. Endorsement of the Millennium Development Goals-Based \nComprehensive National Development Strategy of Mongolia. Resolution endorsing the strategy dated 12 February. \nSection 5.1.6., Strategic objectives of foreign trade policy, states two objectives: (i) increase rationally the variety \nand quantity of export products, and (ii) expand and improve the variety and quantity of import products in line with \nthe long-term trends of economic development. \n4  Following a consolidation of government agency functions enacted December 2014, the trade-related functions of \nthe abolished Ministry of Economic Development have been transferred to the Ministry of Industry. \n5  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 August 2014. \n ", "2   \n4.  The TA will reinforce ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Mongolia in two \nways.7 The  strategy  supports  private  sector  development  and  regional  cooperation,  and \nemphasizes the importance of employment creation and support for agribusiness and small and \nmedium-sized enterprises.8 The TA will increase the transparency and continuity of Mongolia\u2019s \ntrade regime. This will improve the business climate for domestic firms and potential investors. \nIn addition, because of Mongolia\u2019s dependence on its direct neighbors for transit trade, a stable \ntrade policy can stimulate more substantive regional cooperation in the longer term. This can \ncomplement associated Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program trade \npolicy initiatives. \n \n5.  The  government  and  other  stakeholders  recognize  the  need  for  a  stable  ITP \nenvironment for traders and regulators, and for improved development partner coordination (the \nEuropean  Union,  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World \nBank  are  supporting  various  aspects  of  trade-related  capacity  and  policy  development  for \nMongolia). The TA is in line with several other ADB initiatives to support Mongolia\u2019s efforts to \ncapture the gains from trade. A recently approved regional TA focusing in part on facilitating \ntrade  for  landlocked  developing  member  countries  may  generate  outputs  that  feed  into \nimplementation of this TA.9 This changed domestic environment inspires confidence that the TA, \nbuilding and expanding as it does on earlier TA outputs, will generate the increased stability and \npredictability Mongolia needs to expand trade and improve competitiveness.10 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  Trade is the primary driver of growth for Mongolia. Yet raw minerals dominate exports\u2014\nan  unstable,  unreliable,  and  unpredictable  source  of  long-term  revenue.  The  government \nrecognizes the need to diversify exports and promote exports of higher value-added products. \nExports benefit from low applied duties (via Generalized System of Preferences and zero-duty \nmost-favored nation), reflecting the lack of diversification of exports.11 Some exports with the \npotential to grow are confronted by higher-than-average tariffs and nontariff barriers to access \nforeign markets. \n \n7.  Seeking more preferential access for its nonmineral exports, Mongolia has explored \nnegotiating directly with trade partners to obtain more favorable conditions.  In June 2012, \nMongolia launched its first-ever free trade agreement negotiations with Japan to conclude an \neconomic partnership agreement.12 The government expects to conclude the agreement in early \n2015. No other WTO-compliant free trade agreements (FTAs) are in progress with major trading \npartners. Yet deeper regional integration via FTAs (possibly focused on Northeast Asia, where \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014. Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n8  Agriculture is increasingly the main contributor to growth and employs more people than any other sector of the \neconomy. Agriculture accounted for 17.5% of gross domestic product and 30% of overall employment in 2013, but \nagriculture-related outputs currently make up just 8.6% of total merchandise exports. Mongolia is aiming to \nincrease nonmineral exports to 20% of total exports. An ITP must support the development of export markets, \nespecially in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and in Japan and the Republic of Korea. \n9  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Facilitating Trade for Fragile and Landlocked States in the  Post-Bali \nInstitutional Environment. Manila (TA 8655-REG). \n10 ADB. 2012. CAREC 2020. Manila. The CAREC program\u2019s strategic framework focuses on two distinct but \ncomplementary objectives: expanding trade, and improving competitiveness. \n11 World Bank. 2008. http://info.worldbank.org/etools/wti/docs/wti2008/brief129.pdf \n12 Ratification anticipated in the first half of 2015. Possible provisions include lowering the 38.5% customs duty on the \nimport of Mongolian meat and the 11% tax on Mongolian cashmere. These could foster economic diversification \nand increase agriculture exports. \n ", "  3 \nMongolia\u2019s trade dependence has increased to 82%)13 could lead to tariff cuts and a lifting of \nnontariff trade barriers.14 To this end, Mongolia has established a working group to consider the \nmerits of negotiating an FTA with the Eurasian Economic Union\u2019s Customs Union (comprising \nBelarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia). \n \n8.  The government has pursued other non-FTA trade-related arrangements. In September \n2013, it concluded an Agreement on Transparency in Matters Related to International Trade \nand Investment with the United States. A complement to the Trade and Investment Framework \nAgreement signed in 2004, the United States\u2013Mongolia Transparency Agreement applies to \nmatters relating to international trade and investment, and includes joint commitments to provide \nopportunities for public comment on proposed laws and regulations, and to publish final laws \nand  regulations  in  English.  This  publication  commitment  should  make  it  easier  for  foreign \nenterprises to do business in Mongolia. Additional commitments address dispute resolution and \nthe application of discipline on bribery and corruption.15 \n \n9.  An international trade policy framework will provide Mongolia and its trading partners \nwith greater predictability, transparency, and stability in conducting \u2013 and diversifying the scope \nof \u2013 international trade. A well-conceived, far-reaching ITP can help liberalize markets even as it \nbuilds confidence and creates predictability for key trading partners. At the very least, even a \nless  ambitious  ITP  can  create  conditions  for  future  liberalization  by  promoting  a  more \npredictable business climate. \n \n10.  A more predictable trade policy environment will contribute to conditions needed to \nincrease trade and will complement actions taken in other areas to stimulate trade. For example, \nMongolia\u2019s  efforts  to  adopt  international  product  standards  aim to  increase  the  number of \nnational product standards that are identical to international standards.16 An ITP that targets \ndiversification of the existing export mix will acknowledge the need to address barriers to \nagricultural exports, such as difficulty complying with international sanitary and phyto-sanitary \nregulations. This will promote its efforts to upgrade its standards.  \n \n11.  The  WTO  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  highlights  the  need  to  support  developing \ncountries  in  their  efforts  to  capture  gains  from  trade.  A  coherent  ITP  can  promote  trade \nfacilitation by identifying priority areas for trade development. Mongolia is committed to ratifying \nand implementing the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. In July 2014, the government notified \nits Category A commitments on trade facilitation. To implement the agreement, the government \nwill rely largely on support from development partners. To match needs with development \nsupport, it needs to update its Trade Facilitation Needs Assessment, produced initially in 2009. \nThe TA will underpin initial implementation of any trade facilitation measures by ensuring they \nare enshrined in the ITP. \n \n \n                                                \n13 M.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be increased capacity to consolidate trade opportunities and promote \ntrade diversification and competitiveness of the nonmineral sector. By 2018, Parliament will \nadopt  an  ITP  and  institutional  arrangements  for  formulating  trade  policy  and  regulating \ninternational trade will be clarified, contributing to a 10% increase in trade volume and value \nover 2013 baselines (to be established by the consultants). The outcome will be a stable and \npredictable trade policy environment that enables Mongolia to conclude mutually beneficial \nFTAs with its major trading partners. Activities associated with FTA negotiations will promote \nmore effective public\u2013private dialogue and build institutional capacity of staff responsible for \nnegotiating  and  implementing  FTAs.  By  2016,  staff retention  rates  in  key  trade regulatory \nagencies will be increased, the performance of CAREC Corridor 4 will have improved, and the \nfrequency of trade negotiator training programs will have increased. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The  TA  will  develop  a  series  of  policy,  legal,  and  market  assessments; \nrecommendations  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  for  trade  policy  formulation  and \nassociated trade facilitation initiatives; and an analysis of the impact of principal trading partners \nacceding to WTO. The TA will deliver the following outputs: \n(i)  an  assessment  of  the  legal  framework  and  institutional  arrangements  for \nregulating international trade; \n(ii)  a  comparison  of  the  motivation  of  countries  to  adopt  an  ITP,  with  benefits \nstemming from ITP adoption identified; \n(iii)  assessments of the impact of trade liberalization on the food processing industry, \nand  of  trade  challenges  and  opportunities  (including  access  to  broader \ninternational markets with Mongolia\u2019s principal trading partners), and a workshop \nto develop good practice in negotiating trade agreements conducted; and \n(iv)  draft ITP prepared, supported by (a) policy simulation and modeling analysis;  \n(b)  updated recommendations to  enhance  institutional  capacity  in  support of \ntrade policy formulation, implementation of WTO commitments, and the conduct \nof trade negotiations; and (c) a validation seminar. \n \n14.  Associated activities will support Mongolia\u2019s capacity to pursue an efficient trade policy \nand negotiate preferential arrangements to complement the country\u2019s economic development. In \naddition, the TA will promote industry associations and the private sector, so that their products \nget better access to international markets. As appropriate, and with the consent of Mongolian \nauthorities, consultant deliverables will be refined and published as knowledge products (e.g., \npolicy-based briefs, written case studies assessing international experience, and knowledge \nshowcases for senior decision makers). \n \n15.  Key  assumptions  include  (i)  demonstrated  government  commitment  to  adopt  and \nimplement  an  ITP,  (ii)  well-managed  interagency  cooperation  and  coordination,  and  \n(iii)  sufficient  allocation of  resources  to retain trained  staff.  Among  the  risks  identified  are  \n(i)  more  restrictive  trade  practices  undermine  policy  implementation,  and  (ii)  institutional \nassignment of trade policy responsibilities remains unsettled. \n \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of translation and interpretation support; venues for training, \nseminars, and conferences; domestic transportation; and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Ministry of Industry (MoI) will execute, administer, and implement the TA in close \ncollaboration with the Public Management, Financial Sector, and Regional Cooperation Division \nof ADB\u2019s East Asia Department (the TA supervising unit) and ADB\u2019s Mongolia Resident Mission. \nMoI will ensure that all other relevant stakeholders are involved in the required consultations \nand TA implementation. \n \n18.  The  Public  Management,  Financial  Sector,  and  Regional  Cooperation  Division  and \nADB\u2019s resident mission in Mongolia will (i) maintain regular contact with MoI and consultants to \nensure that work proceeds according to the agreed schedules, and (ii) participate in TA-funded \nworkshops  to  ensure  that  stakeholder  views  and  concerns  are  adequately  addressed  in \nconsultant deliverables. Peer review of consultant deliverables by ADB\u2019s Economic Research \nand Regional Cooperation Department may be sought to ensure soundness and objectivity. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2016. A consulting firm will \nbe recruited to assemble a team of experts as described in the outline terms of reference for \nconsultants (Appendix 3) to carry out the proposed studies. A total of 15 person-months of \ninternational and 20 person-months of national consultant inputs will be required to provide \npolicy and advisory services under the TA. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The firm will be \nselected using quality- and cost-based selection procedures (90:10). To ensure that the firm has \nsufficient experience, full technical proposals will be sought. If, however, market conditions \nsuggest that the low value of the contract in combination with requiring a full technical proposal \npresents  a  disincentive  to  otherwise  interested  and  qualified  bidders,  simplified  technical \nproposals may be accepted. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  MoI will provide all counterpart facilities and support required by the consultants. It will \norganize an interim consultative workshop and a final dissemination workshop. The workshops \nwill help ensure broad dissemination of TA outputs. All consultant deliverables will be submitted \nin Mongolian and English and posted on ADB\u2019s website once they are accepted by ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Building Trade Policy Capacity: Formulating an International \nTrade Policy, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and   \n  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselinesa  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2018    Assumptions \nIncreased capacity to  Parliament adopts an ITP   Parliamentary  The government is \nconsolidate trade  records  committed to adopting \nopportunities and  Institutional arrangements for  Government  and implementing an \npromote trade  formulating trade policy and  resolutions and  ITP. \ndiversification and  regulating international trade  directives  High-quality \ncompetitiveness of the  clarified  WTO trade policy  consultants are \nnonmining sector  reviews  recruited. \n  Nonmining-related trade  UNCTAD trade data.
