A key lesson from the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis is that mature bond markets are \ncrucial  for maintaining  a  better  balance  within  financial sectors  and  thus  building  financial \nstability in the region. Regional and national initiatives have focused on removing obstacles and \nbuilding  up  infrastructure  to  bond  market  development,  including  improving  information \nasymmetry. Such barriers prevent effective and efficient direct interaction between multiple \nissuers  and  investors,  by  facilitating  bond  market  information  flows.  The  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN)+31 Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) was endorsed at \nthe meeting of the ASEAN+3 finance ministers in August 2003 to accelerate development of \nefficient and liquid bond markets in the region. The Asian Bonds Online (ABO) website started \nunder the ASEAN+3 ABMI in May 2004 with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA)2 aims to continue ADB support in disseminating and \nimproving information flow and to contribute to increasing the transparency, liquidity, efficiency, \nand  depth  of  bond  markets  in  Asia.  The  managing  director  general,  under  ADB\u2019s  3-year \nknowledge products and services work plan 2007\u20132009, approved the TA concept clearance on \n28 April 2006 to address this need. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  A  major  cause  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis\u2014maturity  mismatches  resulting  from \noverreliance  on  short-term  bank  financing  for  long-term  investment,  as  well  as  currency \nmismatches\u2014could have been reduced if well-developed bond markets were an alternative \navenue for channeling the region\u2019s large savings into long-term investments. Consequently, \nafter the crisis, development of bond markets became an important policy reform agenda item \nfor many Asian governments. There have been a number of initiatives and concrete actions to \nfacilitate bond market development in Asia at subregional and regional levels. These include the \nAsian Bond Fund and Asian Bond Fund II established by the Executives\u2019 Meeting of East Asia-\nPacific Central Banks, the regional bond market development initiative of Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation, and the ABMI of ASEAN+3. \n4.  One of the critical requirements for efficient bond markets is to ensure that both issuers \nand investors can avail of an accurate informational framework\u2014on top of the contractual \nframework, the regulatory and supervisory framework, a diversified investor base, and issuing \nand trading processes based on pricing mechanisms. The need for improved information flows \nfor bond markets in Asia is highlighted by the fact that investors outside the region are not \nalways well acquainted with Asian bond issuers with high financial standings, and with the \neconomic,  social,  and  legal  environment  that  underpins  Asian  bond  markets.  Therefore, \ndeveloping bond markets in Asia requires improved flow of local information to global investors, \nas well as across borders to investors within the region. Some issuers known to be high quality \nand financially strong in one country in the region are often not recognized in other countries.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ASEAN+3  comprises  the  10  members  of  ASEAN  (Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam), plus People's Republic \nof China, Japan, and Republic of Korea. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 August 2007. \n ", "2   \n5.  The ABO website was launched in May 2004, supported by a previous TA.3 It has \nsuccessfully served as a one-stop clearinghouse for Asian bond markets. Similar websites4 \nprovide bond market information in Asia, but they have a different mandate\u2014using a different \nformat or language, and varying information coverage. The ABO website is considered the only \none-stop clearinghouse providing information on sovereign and corporate bond issues in the \nregion, as well as the economic and legal circumstances surrounding these issues, to various \nstakeholders such as investors (institutional and retail), corporate issuers, brokers, underwriting \nhouses, policy makers, market regulators, and academics in the region.   \n6.  Currently, the ABO website has three categories of content: (i) structural aspects of local \ncurrency bond markets (the market infrastructure,5 rules and regulation,6 market activities,7 and \nmarket data8 of each market) in the region, ASEAN+3 ABMI activities, and a large number of \nprogress indicators; (ii) cover flow of research (market analysis and policy research) and news \narticles  (commentary)  related  to  the  bond  markets  of  each  country  in  the  region,  and  a \nknowledge center (bond glossary, data release, and how to buy bonds and bond funds); and \n(iii) market watch, which provides the major  market-priced variables and year-to-date and \nmonth-to-date performance figures for each country, updated twice daily.9 The website has also \nextended its content to information such as a new features alert, new issues and issues \nchange,10 and Islamic finance.11   \n \n7.  Initially, the focus of the ABO website was to provide links to information available on \nother websites. However, it has since generated its own content on bond market development in \nthe region in response to viewer demand. The Asian bond indicators section presents graphs, \ntables, and downloadable spreadsheets of 42 indicators which allow viewers to analyze the \nlevel of activity in each market and how it has progressed since 1995 (in most cases). This \nsection  covers  a  range  of  categories:  the  size  (government  bonds,  corporate  bonds,  and \nsecuritization);  liquidity;  yield,  and  returns  of  local  currency  bond  markets\u2014including  the \ncomposition and profiles of issuers and investors; indicators of currency mismatch; and key \neconomic  variables  (including  credit-rating  history).  These  indicators  are  drawn  from  data \nprovided by local agencies and issuers, as well as several data vendors. They are a useful \nanalytical tool for various stakeholders in dealing with these vigorous bond markets. The graphs \nand spreadsheets assist (i) prospective investors in managing suitable risk assets in their \nportfolios, (ii) academics in analyzing how issuance patterns and local risk factors contribute to \nthe development of local currency bond markets, and (iii) market regulators and policy makers \nin learning how governments can shape the public good of local currency bond markets to \nfacilitate economic development.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for the Asian Bonds Online Website. Manila (Japan Fund for Information and \nCommunication Technology  9041-REG, for $2,400,000, approved on 26 December). \n4 Commercial websites are mainly journalistic, data vendors, or hybrids (combining news, data, and trading services). \nNoncommercial websites include public institutions; nonprofit, self-regulatory, and academic institutions; and \nindustry lobbies. \n5 Includes market overview; key market participants; exchange and trading platforms, registries, clearing, and \nsettlement; and rating and rating agencies. \n6 Includes supervisory framework, market regulation, securitization, protection of investors, and investor participation. \n7 Includes instruments, bond identification, benchmark, reference rate, funding and hedging, indices, and street \nconventions.  \n8 Includes major issues, trading statistics, government auction calendar, and auction results. \n9 Market Watch is linked to Reuters, and the information is updated automatically.  \n10 This provides links to several sources for new issuance of bonds in the region.    \n11 This section covers structural aspects such as (i) market infrastructure, (ii) rules and regulations, (iii) market \nactivities, (iv) market data, and (v) government polices and initiatives.    \n ", "  3\n8.  During the last 4 years, the ABO website has progressed from a familiarization site on \nlocal currency bond markets in the region to a one-stop clearinghouse that supports all bond \nmarket users and participants by disseminating information. It will further facilitate regional \nfinancial market integration by enhancing its function as an information portal. The increased \nsignificance of the website is reflected by the steady rise in user activity. Average daily visitor \nnumbers have increased gradually and continuously from 538 in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2004; \n1,746 in Q4 2005; 1,593 in Q4 2006; 2,740 in Q4 2007; to 3,981 in Q1 2008. This rapid increase \nsuggests that a high proportion of users are first-time visitors whose visits are shorter check-in \nvisits. Those who find the site useful return and begin to spend more time.12 Throughout these \ncycles, the most popular sections (in order) are market watch, Asian bond indicators, market \nanalysis, and commentary.  \n \n9.  The Asian Bond Monitor (ABM) is a knowledge output that uses data and analysis from \nthe ABO website. It started in November 2004 and reviews developments in East Asian local \ncurrency bond markets twice a year, featuring a theme chapter that discusses relevant bond \nmarket development issue.13 The ABM has been a useful tool for ADB support to regional \neconomic policy dialogue\u2014mainly for the ASEAN+3 ABMI Focal Group Meeting. So far, the \nABM covers the 10 ASEAN member countries plus People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, \nChina; and Republic of Korea.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  improve  information  flow  for  Asian  bond  markets  by \nmanaging  the  ABO  website.  This  will  help  increase  the  transparency,  liquidity,  efficiency, \ncredibility, and depth of bond markets in the region; lower funding costs for Asian bond issuers; \nand facilitate cross-border capital flows. It will support the streamlining of organizational and \nregulatory procedures for bond market access, and enhance corporate governance and higher \ndisclosure standards. More developed and mature bond markets will enable the private as well \nas  public  sector  of  Asian  countries  to  raise  and  invest  long-term  capital  with  effective \nmanagement  of  credit,  maturity  and  currency  risks,  thereby  reducing  their  economic  and \nfinancial vulnerabilities. The TA will facilitate monetary financial cooperation and integration by \ndeveloping robust local currency bond markets in the region, and thus support key result areas \nof the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) based on the regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI) strategy.14 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will have four components:  \n \n(i)   Managing and maintaining the ABO website. The TA will finance the operation \nof ABO to make the website more accessible to investors and issuers as an \ninformation  portal  for  regional  bond  markets.  It  will  assist  policy  makers, \n                                                 \n12 The average user session length was 17.5 minutes (min) in Q4 2004, 18.6 min in O4 2005, 21.7 min in Q4 2006, \nand 16.6 min in Q4 2007. \n13 The ABM featured \u201cMonitoring Financial Integration in East Asia\u201d in November 2005; \u201cFinancial Deepening in \nEmerging East Asia\u2014An International Perspective\u201d in March 2006; \u201cBond Market Liquidity\u2014Empirical Analysis, \nMarket Survey, and Policy Options\u201d in November 2006; \u201cSecuritization\u2014Concepts and Development in East Asia\u201d \nin April 2007; and \u201cThe Indian Bond Market\u2014Developments and Challenges Ahead\u201d in April 2008.  \n14 ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n ", "4   \nregulators, and journalists (who may influence market development significantly) \nin understanding how policies, rules, and market participants\u2019 behavior affect the \nmarkets in the short and long term\u2014both in local markets and in an integrated \nsystem. It will also support academics and students by providing an updated \nbond market database and indicators. Accessibility improvements will include \nupgrading to an easy and user-friendly interface for first-time and nonexpert \nusers, establishing a relational link between all sections of the site to make \nspontaneous and comparison analysis of topics, and linking the glossary function \nto every aspect of the site content.  \n \n(ii)   Enhancing the website content. The TA plans to improve and enhance the \ncontent on the regional bond markets\u2014comprising the securitization market data \nand  research  tool;  repurchase  agreement  (repo)  markets;  risk  management \ninstruments that are developing in the region, including interest rate and bond \nderivatives; currency and credit derivatives; and performance indicators for bond \nmarket development. Developing the securitization market data and research tool \nwill  include  the  following  subcomponents:  defining  user  projects,  developing \nagreement  with  data  suppliers  such  as  global  and  domestic  credit  rating \nagencies  in  the  region  and  data  vendors,  designing  the  data  architecture, \ncreating user interface tools, loading and validating data, working through trial \nanalysis with the initial trial user to refine the analysis-and-delivery steps, and \npromoting wider use of tools for regulatory planning. Collaboration with the Bank \nfor International Settlements (BIS) and other entities experienced in handling \ncomplex archives will further refine the architecture and the interface tool. On a \nrequest basis, the TA will provide a monthly briefing to ADB staff in the ADB \nlibrary and a weekly highlights newsletter to ABO website clients. \n \n(iii)  Expanding  the  coverage  of  the  Credit  Risk  Monitor. The TA will include \nanalysis of market pricing mechanisms (especially in the ASEAN+3 markets), \nhow they respond to various external and market pressures and changes in \ninstitutions, the  market cycle,  new information,  and  regulations.  This can  be \nachieved by collecting country-specific and regional information and data, and \nmaking  credit-specific  analysis  of  changes  in  the  cost  of  funds.  Credit  risk \nassessment is the core function of credit-rating agencies, and this will provide \nindirect support of ABMI and OREI initiatives with regional rating agencies. As \nmore traditional public sector financing is moved from the central government to \nlocal  government  and  private  sector  operators,  improved  understanding  by \nofficials and outside investors in the factors affecting local credit risk can lead to \nboth better governance of and lower funding costs for local infrastructure. \n \n(iv)   Publishing ABM. The TA will finance the publication of the ABM, a knowledge \noutput that uses ABO data and analysis. The ABM reviews recent developments \nin East Asian local currency bond markets twice a year with a theme chapter, \nwhich features a special topic relevant to the bond market development issue. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. It is estimated to cost the equivalent of $900,000 to cover remuneration, \ntravel, and per diem for international and national consultants. It will also cover the cost of the \n ", "  5\nworkshops, seminars, and publicity activities of the ABO website. Details of the cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. OREI will administer the TA, implement the \nTA in close consultation with ASEAN+3 ABMI officials, and supervise the work of the TA \nconsultants.15 \n \n14.  International and national consultants will be engaged for implementing the TA\u2014about \n21 person-months of international and 138 person-months of national consulting services. The \nTA will be implemented over 12 months, starting in June 2008 and ending in May 2009. All \nconsultants and resource persons will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be engaged as \nindividual consultants. The scope of work and outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION   \n \n15.
