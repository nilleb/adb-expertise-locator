The Government of Indonesia (Government) introduced a major decentralization reform \nagenda in 1999 to devolve significant authorities to district-level governments. In 2003\u20132004, a \nnumber of new laws were enacted and  the original decentralization laws  were amended to \nimprove implementation of the agenda. The Government has been working with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to formulate a proposed sector development program to effectively \nguide the next phase of decentralization over 2005\u20132010. In this context, the Government in \n2003 requested technical assistance (TA) from ADB to (i) formulate a coherent regulatory \nframework  for  fiscal  decentralization  and  disseminate  regulatory  provisions  on  public \nexpenditure and financial management (PEFM) at the local government level; and (ii) develop a \nNational Action Plan on Decentralization (NAPD) to provide policy directions to the Government \nover the medium term. Based on earlier discussions, a fact-finding mission launched in October \n2004 reached an understanding with the Government on the purpose, output, methodology, and \nkey activities, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1 The TA  project \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  decentralization  process  in  Indonesia,  in  terms  of  its  scope  and  speed,  is \nunprecedented.  Designed  to  provide  operational  autonomy  to  district  governments,  bring \ndecision making on public services closer to the people in a geographically vast country,2 and \nallow greater local discretion and opportunities for local citizen participation, the reform agenda \nhas had to balance the distribution of powers between the national, provincial, and local \ngovernments. The central Government transferred more than 2 million civil servants to  local \ngovernments soon after the enactment of the key decentralization laws in 1999. Despite the \nmagnitude of the process and the widely varying capacity levels of local governments, there is \nno  evidence  that  decentralization  has  resulted  in  any  major  disruptions  in  public  service \ndelivery.  Yet,  due  to  its  complexity,  decentralization  has  aggravated  the  already  weak \nintergovernment coordination and has imposed higher costs on businesses.  \n \n3.  Effective  decentralization  is  predicated  on  three  premises:  (i) functions  should  be \ndevolved according to capacities, (ii) funds should follow functions, and (iii) local governments \nshould be held accountable for performance. These premises are not being met in Indonesia \ndue to gaps and inconsistencies in the regulatory framework, lack of sufficient capacities at both \nthe central and local levels, and absence of a national vision for decentralization.3  \n \n4.  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework.  Laws  in  Indonesia  tend  to  provide  a  broad \nframework, leaving related powers and obligations to be defined and clarified in implementing \nregulations and ministerial decrees. However, given the slow process of consensus building and \nlack of adequate oversight mechanisms to resolve key differences between ministries, many \nissues  regarding  decentralization  have  not  been  sufficiently  addressed  in  the  regulatory \nframework. In particular, implementing regulations and decrees, adopted and implemented by \ndifferent ministries, have not been well coordinated and are often inconsistent.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 May 2003.  \n2  Indonesia is divided into 33 provinces and more than 435 districts, with an average population per province of \nslightly less than 7 million, and about 0.5 million per district. \n3  There are approximately 7 laws, 9 government regulations, 5 presidential decrees, and 22 ministerial regulations \nthat are concerned with planning, budgeting, accounting, financial reporting, and accountability for the central and \nlocal governments.  \n ", "2  \n5.  The legal framework for decentralization, provided by the original Laws on Regional \nAutonomy (Law 22/1999) and Regional Fiscal Balance Law (Law 25/1999), devolved significant \nauthority to district-level governments, irrespective of differences in size, socioeconomic status, \nand fiscal and human capacities. Under Law 22/1999, local governments are responsible for \nservices in 11 key sectors, namely public works, health, education, agriculture, communications, \ntrade and industry, capital investment, environment, land affairs, cooperatives, and human \nresources. However, this law does not clearly delineate specific functional responsibilities within \nthese sectors. The revised Law on Regional Administration (Law 32/2004) expands this list to \ncover 16 sectors and/or areas, but does not clarify the delegation of functions. \n \n6.  Compared with the vague assignment of expenditure responsibilities, the assignment of \nrevenues under the original Law on Regional Fiscal Balance (Law 25/1999) is relatively clear. \nHowever, the allocation of the centrally managed general-purpose grants to equalize fiscal \ncapacities across regions has been heavily influenced by the interests of resource-rich regions, \nwhich exacerbates, rather than alleviates, inequalities. While the revised Law on Regional Fiscal \nBalance  (Law  33/2004)  provides  for  some  improvement,  it  does  not  provide  any  clear \noperational  formula  for  determining  fiscal  need  or  the  general  purpose  and  earmarked \ntransfers.4  \n \n7.  Implementing regulations need to be adopted under Law 32/2004 (about 20) and Law \n33/2004  (about  11).  To  ensure  consistency,  these  regulations  require  close  coordination \nbetween the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA). For example, \nto ensure that public resources in the decentralized environment are utilized in an efficient and \naccountable manner, benchmarking and monitoring government performance in service delivery \nis  needed.  Both  laws  require  that  obligatory  functions  assigned  to  local  governments  be \nevaluated against minimum service standards (MSS). MOHA is overseeing the formulation of \nMSS  by  line  ministries  but  has  not  factored  in  the  calculation  of  fiscal  transfers  or  local \ngovernment capacity to ensure that standards developed can be implemented. \n \n8.  Budgeting and financial management in government is regulated under recently adopted \nlaws on State Finance (Law 17/2003), State Treasury (Law 1/1004), State Audit (Law 15/2004), \nand National Development Planning (Law 25/2004). These laws  introduce a range of new \nplanning, budgeting, accounting,  and  financial  management  principles and procedures that \naffect  all  government  entities.  At  the  central  government  level,  a  new  unified  budget \nclassification system has been adopted to combine routine and development expenditures and \nto reflect expenditure priorities along functional rather than sectoral lines. Law 17/2003 also \nstipulates that a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and revised budget classification \nsystems be introduced and MTEF be replicated at the local government level.  Through the \nCommittee on Accounting Standards, MOF has prepared government regulations on accounting \nstandards 1 to 11, as well as the overall conceptual framework for government accounting in \nline with Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 requirements. MOF will need to closely \ncoordinate with MOHA to prepare a plan for implementation of these national accounting \nstandards at the local level.  \n \n9.  The  differences  between  existing  procedures  and  arrangements  under  previously \nadopted regulations and decrees and those outlined in the new laws are substantive and need \nto be reconciled to provide a comprehensive and consistent framework for effective financial \nmanagement. An essential part of these reforms are revisions to Government Regulation No. \n105/2000 on regional financial management and accountability and revisions to MOHA Decree \n                                                 \n4  The revised law provides for a marginal increase in general purpose transfers that will take effect only in 2008. \n ", "  3\nNo. 29/2002 on financial management to provide for consistency with the new legal framework \nfor financial management.5  \n \n10.  MOHA is responsible for disseminating the regulatory framework at the provincial and \ndistrict government levels and for evaluating budgeting and financial management practices and \noutcomes at the district level through the provinces. As Law 32/2004 has conferred greater \noversight authority on provincial governors with respect to local government budgets, MOHA \nneeds to ensure that province-level capacities in this area are enhanced.6 Functionally, MOF \noversees intergovernment fiscal relations; monitors, regulates, and supports PEFM at the local \ngovernment level; and provides local governments with guidance, support, and supervision in \nimplementing Law 17/2003 and the new accounting standards.  \n \n11.  National Government Vision. The rapid pace of decentralization reforms in Indonesia, \nincluding the enactment and amendments of key laws and regulations within a relatively short \nspan of 5 years, have made the challenges more daunting. Laws and regulations have not been \nwell  coordinated  and  do  not  effectively  address  key  issues,  including  the  need  to  more \neffectively provide for more equitable and sustainable intergovernment fiscal relations. In the \nabsence of a clear and coordinated framework, local governments, which are responsible for \npublic service delivery, often invoke innovative solutions, which will fragment and undermine the \nreform effort over the long term.  \n \n12.  An effective institutional arrangement that provides clear and impartial oversight on \ndecentralization issues has not yet been established. Although Law 22/1999 provided for a \nRegional  Autonomy  Advisory  Council  chaired  by  MOHA,  this  body  has  not  become  fully \nfunctional. Recent developments in this area, however, are encouraging. Recent revisions to \nthis law (under Law 32/2004) may lead to the establishment of a Regional Autonomy Advisory \nBoard  by  presidential  decree.  A  new  regional  representative  council  (DPD)  of  elected \nrepresentatives from each region of Indonesia has been established as part of the People's \nRepresentative  Assembly  to  provide  parliamentary  oversight  on  issues  related  to \ndecentralization. However, as  DPD is a new body, there needs to be sound interface and \ncoordination between the Government and DPD to a common understanding of the need for key \nreforms, especially with respect  to intergovernment fiscal relations. Within the framework of \nADB\u2019s proposed Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Sector Development \nProgram, MOF, MOHA and the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) recently \nagreed to form a high-level national intergovernment steering committee (NSC) to improve \ncoordination at the central government level and promote a more harmonized decentralization \nframework. While this is the first time that three ministries have formally agreed to coordinate \nthe implementation of decentralization laws, a longer-term institutional framework is vital. To \nprovide for an effective longer-term policy, institutional,  legal, and regulatory framework for \ndecentralization, the Government has agreed to formulate an NAPD through NSC. The NAPD \nwill: (i) identify key problem areas in implementing administrative and fiscal decentralization that \nhave not been effectively addressed in the legal or regulatory framework; and (ii) propose a \n                                                 \n5  For example, MOHA Decree No. 29 provides for a multiyear framework through strategic planning of each entity, \nwhich is inconsistent with the METF based on budgeting over  2 years with strategic short- and medium-term \nplanning at both levels of government (including regional governments) and their entities, introduced under Law \n17/2003.  \n6   Under Law 32/2004, greater coordination responsibilities are imposed on provincial governments. Regional heads, \nin coordination with  DPD, are required to develop policies, plans, laws, regulations, and budgets, and are \nresponsible for regional financial management, including supervision of budget execution and accountability. \nProvincial budgets need to be evaluated and approved by MOHA and district budgets need to be evaluated and \napproved by provincial governors, who report to MOHA on the outcomes.   \n ", "4  \nseries  of  forward  looking  measures  to  strengthen  administrative  and  fiscal  aspects  of \ndecentralization,  including  more  equitable  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  and  a  more \neffective institutional framework for intergovernmental coordination that are sustainable in the \nlong term. \n \n13.  ADB Support. ADB has provided significant and ongoing support for decentralization \nand local governance reforms since 1998 (Appendix 2), which has been closely coordinated \nwith other development partners through bilateral consultations as well as the decentralization \nworking group under the Consultative Group on Indonesia. The success of reform initiatives has \nbeen  undermined  by  the  lack  of  effective  coordination  among  government  agencies,  a \ncoordinated  national  forward-looking  vision,  and  appropriate  checks  and  balances  on \ngovernment at different levels.  \n \n14.  Decentralization  reforms  are  complex  in  any  country,  and  there  are  significant \nchallenges in Indonesia given the rapid pace at which initial reforms were introduced. The TA \ndraws extensively from initiatives of ADB and other development partners and supports reforms \non a selective basis to achieve regulatory consistency and formulation of a forward-looking \nNAPD to address weaknesses in the policy, institutional, legal, and regulatory framework. The \nnew Government has reaffirmed the need for support in these areas through the signing of a \nmemorandum of understanding for the proposed Local Government Finance and Governance \nReform  Program,  which  is  intended  to  provide  policy  reform  and  investment  support  to \neffectively implement the decentralization agenda. The proposed TA will facilitate consensus \nbuilding within the Government for forward-looking reforms, in addition to providing immediate \nadvisory support to achieve regulatory consistency.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n15.  The overall goal of the TA is to enhance transparency, accountability, efficiency, and \neffectiveness in the delivery of basic public services at the local level. The purpose of the TA is \nto  support  the  central  Government  in  (i) formulating  a  coherent  regulatory  framework  to \nimplement  fiscal  decentralization  and  disseminating  the  framework  on  PEFM  at  the  local \ngovernment level, and (ii) formulating the NAPD to provide policy directions to the Government \nover the medium term. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will cover two areas:  \n \n(i)  Harmonization of the regulatory framework for fiscal decentralization. This \nwill  include  support  for  drafting  background  papers  on  fiscal  aspects  of \ndecentralization, leading to a set of consistent regulations in areas concerning \nfunctional assignments, local government performance, financial management, \nintergovernment fiscal transfers, and local government borrowing; drafting of \ncosting and technical guidelines on MSS in health, education and public works; \nand disseminating the regulatory framework on PEFM at the local government \nlevel; and \n \n(ii)  Formulation of the NAPD. This will entail support for drafting a medium-term \nreform plan aimed at (a) establishing effective and sustainable coordination and \ninstitutional arrangements for decentralization, (b) identifying key problem areas \n ", "  5\nand inconsistencies that have not been addressed in the legal framework, and \n(c) achieving  greater  horizontal  fiscal  balance  across  the  regions,  through \nassessments  of  provincial  and  district  fiscal  capacities  and  needs  and the \nintergovernmental  flow  between  them,  and  ensuring  an  appropriate  vertical \nbalance between the center and the local regions. The NAPD will be formulated \nin  a  consultative  manner  based  on  feedback  from  the  central  Government, \nrepresentatives of local governments, and DPD. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,125,000  equivalent,  including  foreign \nexchange costs of $515,000 and local currency costs of $610,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $900,000 equivalent covering the total foreign exchange costs \nand local currency costs of $385,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  provide \n$225,000  equivalent  to  finance  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  other  expenditures \n(Appendix 3).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  and  MOF  and  MOHA  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. The TA will engage 15 person-months of international consultants and \n51 person-months of domestic consultants. The international consultants will be experts in fiscal \ndecentralization,  intergovernment  relations,  and  public  financial  management.  Domestic \nconsultants will have expertise in government coordination, public expenditure management, \npublic service delivery, parliamentary relations, information technology, and capacity building. \nThe terms of reference and reporting arrangements are set out in Appendix 4. Consultants may \nbe recruited individually or through a firm, based on a simplified technical proposal using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. All consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB \nin accordance with ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. All procurement under the \nTA will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. The TA will begin in March \n2005 and be completed in May 2006.  \n \nIV.
