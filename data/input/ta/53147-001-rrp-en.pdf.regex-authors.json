THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nof up to $4,950,000 to TTC Energy Joint Stock Company (TTC Energy); and (ii) a proposed partial \ncredit guarantee (PCG) covering a principal amount of the dong equivalent of up to $5,400,000 \nplus interest thereon for the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of \nVietnam (BIDV), both for the Commercial and Industrial Rooftop Solar Energy Project in Viet Nam. \n \n2.  The project entails the development of multiple rooftop solar photovoltaic facilities of 1 \nmegawatt (MW) or less on rooftops of commercial and industrial buildings in Viet Nam, targeting \na total aggregate capacity of up to 118 MW. TTC Energy has already completed and financed \nwith equity the project\u2019s first 11.2 MW.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its capacity as \nthe mandated lead arranger, has worked with TTC Energy to develop a financial and project \nstructure that has crowded in other development finance institutions to provide longer-tenor \nUnited States (US) dollar financing, which local lenders are unable to offer. In addition, the \nproposed PCG has allowed BIDV to become comfortable with providing a local currency tranche \nwith a tenor beyond what it typically offers. The project will be the first and largest independent \npower producer solar rooftop project in the country and will significantly increase Viet Nam\u2019s \ncommercial and industrial rooftop solar generating capacity by about 11 times, from an estimated \n11.3 MW as of May 2019 to 129.3 MW by project completion, which is expected in 2023.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Electricity demand in Viet Nam has grown on average by 12% annually from 2005 to 2015 \nand is projected to grow by more than 8.0% through 2030,3 posing a huge challenge to its energy \nsector and National Green Growth Strategy. 4 By 2025, peak demand in Viet Nam is expected to \novertake Thailand in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Meeting this growing demand without \nsignificantly increasing the country\u2019s contribution to global greenhouse gas (GHG) levels will \nrequire an alternative to the large-scale coal developments that are currently underway. \n \n4.  Strong projected electricity demand growth, declining coal reserves, and limited potential \nto develop further large-scale hydropower plants led the government in 2018 to create a pilot \nrenewable energy program,5 which increased national solar production from 150 MW to nearly 5 \ngigawatts by June 2019.6 In spite of the success of the pilot program,  Viet Nam faces a threat \nthat demand for power will outpace supply as soon as 2021.7 Rooftop solar offers a quick and \nefficient way for Viet Nam to quickly deploy substantial amounts of additional renewable energy \ncapacity. Unlike utility-scale projects, which need significant investments in grid infrastructure, \nrooftop solar systems can be widely deployed without substantial upgrades to the distribution \n \n1  As of January 2020. \n2  United States Agency for International Development, Vietnam Low Emission Energy Program. 2019.

The decision established a pilot renewable energy program, setting targets of 800 \nMW for solar energy and an additional 850 MW for wind energy. \n6  EVN. 2019.

Compared with ground-mounted solar, rooftop solar has historically been difficult to \nimplement at scale. Ground-mounted solar benefits from a 20-year feed-in tariff of $0.0935 per \nkilowatt-hour.8 Aside from guaranteed revenues from the state-owned offtaker, Vietnam Electricity \n(EVN),  ground-mounted  solar  benefits  from  the  US  dollar-indexation  of  the  tariff,  allowing \ninternational financiers to finance projects in US dollars, which is much cheaper than doing so in \nlocal currency. \n \n6.  In contrast, rooftop solar installations do not have a set power purchase agreement with \nEVN, and do not earn revenue in US dollars. This has prevented the market from expanding, as \npotential project developers have to rely on more expensive local currency financing. Potential \ncommercial and industrial customers would typically not be able to use all the electricity generated \nby their rooftop solar systems because of downtime, such as on weekends or holidays. This \nunusable surplus power prevents potential customers from entering into take-or-pay contracts. \nThe higher financing costs, combined with the inability to enter into take-or-pay contracts, have \nhistorically prevented the rooftop solar industry from being commercially viable. As such, as of \nJune 2019, the total commercial and industrial solar rooftop segment in Viet Nam was less than \n20 MW, compared with the total solar capacity of more than 4,000 MW for utility-scale solar.9 \n \n7.  Seeking to increase the adoption of rooftop solar, the Viet Nam regulators eliminated \nlicensing requirements for the installation and operation of solar systems of less than 1 MW.10 In \nearly 2019, the Ministry of Industry and Trade began allowing rooftop solar projects in Viet Nam \nto have two-way meters, which permitted owners of solar rooftop systems to sell unused power \nto the grid, independent of any existing sales agreement, and to receive a feed-in tariff.11 This has \ngreatly improved the economics of rooftop solar and has mitigated a key risk barrier, which had \nhindered Viet Nam\u2019s scaling up of grid-parity rooftop solar power. \n \n8.  Project  design.  The  project  entails  leasing  of  sub-1  MW  solar  systems  (each  a \nsubproject) on the rooftops of commercial and industrial buildings in southern Viet Nam. All \nsubprojects  will  adhere  to  the  standardized  financial,  technical,  environmental,  and  social \nframework agreed by TTC Energy and the lenders including ADB, the Netherlands Development \nFinance Company, the Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries, and BIDV. BIDV \nwill screen all potential customers against an agreed set of financial criteria. Individual subproject \nconstruction will only take place once BIDV has approved the potential lessee on behalf of the \nlenders. TTC Energy will use its equity to fully fund the installation of each solar system and \nlenders will only disburse once each subproject has completed construction and the lenders\u2019 \ntechnical advisor has confirmed compliance with an agreed technical framework. \n \n9.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] Lessees will also be free to enter into a \npower purchase agreement with EVN, which will purchase all surplus electricity generated by the \nsolar rooftop system. \n \n \n8  Government of Viet Nam. 2017.

Thanh Thanh Cong Investment Joint Stock Company (TTC) is a \ngroup of private and publicly owned legally independent companies. All of TTC\u2019s companies and \nsubsidiaries are ultimately owned or controlled by Dang Van Thanh\u2019s family. TTC began in 1979 \nas a sugar and molasses company and has grown into a leading Vietnamese conglomerate with \nmore  than  10,000  employees  working  in  four  core  business  sectors:  real  estate,  energy, \nagriculture, and tourism.12 In 1991, Dang Van Thanh, the TTC chairperson, took control of a small \nrural bank, Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank (Sacombank),13 and turned it into \none of the largest commercial banks in Viet Nam.14 \n \n11.  TTC is a renewable energy pioneer in Viet Nam. Beginning in 2003, TTC-Bien Hoa Joint \nStock Company was among the few sugar companies in Viet Nam to begin installing sugar \nbagasse cogeneration facilities at their sugar plants. Today, TTC-Bien Hoa Join Stock Company \nhas 88.6 MW of total biomass generation capacity. The TTC energy unit, Gia Lai Electricity Joint \nStock Company (GEC), owns and operates 14 small and medium-sized hydropower plants with \ntotal capacity of about 100 MW. In 2017, GEC received an equity injection from Armstrong South \nEast  Asia  Clean  Energy  Fund.  Armstrong  South  East  Asia  Clean  Energy  Fund  and  the \nInternational Finance Corporation are now the second and third largest shareholders of GEC, \nafter the Dang family. GEC is listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange. \n \n12.  Following the release of feed-in tariffs for wind and solar power, TTC identified wind and \nsolar power as its most important investment priority and future growth driver. In late 2018, TTC \n(through GEC) completed and connected to the national grid the first large-scale solar projects \nunder Vietnam\u2019s renewable pilot program in Thua Thien-Hue province (35 MW) and Gia Lai \nprovince (69 MW). Under separate joint ventures, GEC, as the majority shareholder, worked with \nGulf Energy (Thailand) to develop two additional solar farm projects (69 MW and 50 MW), which \nwere completed in mid-2019. The TTC group is the largest and most experienced private sector \noperator of renewable energy in Viet Nam. \n \n13.  TTC Energy, the borrower, was established in 2017 as a subsidiary to spearhead TTC\u2019s \nefforts in the solar rooftop business. TTC Energy targets commercial and industrial buildings as \npotential clients because of their large usable rooftop space and strong incentives to reduce \nelectricity costs, as their cost per kilowatt-hour is in the highest grid electricity price brackets. As \nof January 2020, TTC Energy had completed nearly 50 rooftop solar installations totaling 11.2 \nMW,15 and was responsible for more than 60% of the total solar rooftop capacity in Viet Nam. All \nof TTC Energy\u2019s existing rooftop projects use Sharp panels. \n \n14.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence.16 TTC Energy, its shareholders, and its executives \nand management, as well as its significant contracting entities, do not appear to constitute a \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risk as there are no unresolved or substantiated \nadverse media or relevant information related to them. Tax integrity due diligence was not \nrequired. \n \n \n12 About 40% of TTC\u2019s employees are women. \n13 In 2008, ADB provided a $25 million loan to Sacombank. ADB.

The Revised National Power Development Plan, 2011\u20132020 aims to prioritize \nthe development of renewable energy sources for power production and increase solar power \ncapacity to 850 MW by 2020, about 4,000 MW by 2025, and 12,000 MW by 2030. 17 The project \nis aligned with the following impacts: the contribution of solar energy increased, GHG emissions \nlowered, and Viet Nam\u2019s power supply diversified. The successful implementation of the project \nwill demonstrate how to implement rooftop solar at scale in Viet Nam. This project structure can \nbe replicated across ADB member countries. \n \n16.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: supply of clean power to the \ncommercial  and  industrial  sectors  increased.  It  will  generate  about  123,000  MW-hours  of \nelectricity per year and reduce about 107,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per \nyear.18 \n \n17.  Outputs. The outputs of the project will be as follows: (i) total installed rooftop solar \ncapacity increased to 118 MW with a marketing strategy focused on promoting TTC Energy\u2019s \nproducts and services to women developed and executed; (ii) at least 150 permanent jobs \ncreated; (iii) gender inclusiveness of TTC Energy improved through employment targets, internal \npolicies and training; and (iv) local economy supported through domestic purchases of at least $2 \nmillion per annum.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project supports private \nsector participation in infrastructure, a core pillar of ADB\u2019s long-term strategy as affirmed by its \nStrategy 2030.19 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, \n2016\u20132020 in supporting the expansion of infrastructure and environment-friendly technologies \nfor clean energy generation.20 It also contributes to the objectives of Viet Nam\u2019s Revised National \nPower Development Plan, 2011\u20132020.21 \n \n19.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s energy policy, which encourages interventions designed to shift reliance on fossil fuel \nsources for energy to renewable forms of energy to slow down the growth of GHG emissions and \nhelp countries achieve energy self-sufficiency.22 The project will increase Viet Nam\u2019s use of \nrenewable energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, thereby mitigating GHG \nemissions. It is also aligned with Viet Nam\u2019s commitments to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of providing $80.0 billion in \nclimate finance by 2030.23 \n \n17 Government of Viet Nam. 2016.

This is the first large-scale rooftop project for Viet \nNam. The project has considered experience from previous ADB ground-mounted and rooftop \nsolar projects in the structuring and documentation of the transaction.24 In particular, the project \nincorporated lessons in developing the technical criteria, the customer screening criteria, and the \nenvironment and safeguards standardized framework. The transaction is also structured such \nthat installations are fully funded by equity and ADB only disburses once construction is complete, \nthus eliminating construction risk.

It has installed over 11MW for commercial and industrial \ncompanies throughout Viet Nam and is the segment\u2019s market leader. \nImplementation period  TTC Energy has already begun installing solar rooftop systems using \nthe  agreed  technical,  environmental,  and  social  standardized \nframework. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nConstruction arrangements  TTC Energy will be responsible for finding qualified customers, and \ninstalling and maintaining their solar rooftop systems. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \nOperations arrangements   \nRevenue structure  The lessee only pays TTC Energy for actual electricity consumed. TTC \nEnergy remotely reads the meter each month and sends an invoice to \nthe lessee. The lessee will also enter into a power purchase agreement \nwith  Vietnam  Electricity,  which  will  purchase  all  surplus  power. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] While the diversification \nof revenue is a benefit, success of the project is not dependent upon \nthe sale of surplus electricity. \nOperation and maintenance  TTC Energy is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the \nsolar systems.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance will have two components: (i) a direct loan of up to $4.95 \nmillion and (ii) a PCG covering a principal amount of the dong equivalent of up to $5.4 million to \nBIDV plus interest thereon. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  Catalytic impact. ADB\u2019s support for the first nonrecourse financing of a rooftop solar \nprogram in Viet Nam has the potential to be paradigm shifting. Viet Nam urgently needs new \npower generation to address growing demand, and rooftop solar offers a quick solution, with little \nor no cost to EVN. Successful implementation of the project would provide a considerable \ndemonstration effect to the private sector regarding the viability of rooftop solar for the commercial \nand industrial market segments. \n \n27.  Improving commercial viability and compliance. ADB\u2019s PCG is essential for BIDV\u2019s \nparticipation in the project. Lending from BIDV and Netherlands Development Finance Company \nin local currency significantly mitigates the foreign exchange risk, which is often a difficult or cost-\nprohibitive barrier for most private sector projects in Viet Nam. ADB is also able to offer the longer-\ntenor debt that infrastructure projects typically require, improving the commercial viability of the \nproject. ADB\u2019s participation also promotes stringent governance, and extensive environmental \nand social due diligence. \n \n28.  Mobilization  of  financing.  As  the  mandate  lead  arranger,  ADB  is  responsible  for \nstructuring the debt and arranging the finance. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n29.  Demonstration  of  a  scalable  model  for  private  sector  financing  of  distributed \nrenewable energy projects. Rooftop solar programs are typically more difficult to implement \nthan ground-mounted solar. It is difficult to find the correct balance in establishing a standardized \nfinancial and technical framework that ensures a creditworthy portfolio of subprojects, yet does \nnot inhibit the growth and competitiveness of the project sponsor. If this project is successfully \nimplemented, it will be replicable and scalable not only in Viet Nam, but in other ADB member \ncountries. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n30.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n34.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category C), involuntary resettlement (category C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).26 \n \n35.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe institutional capacity and commitment of TTC Energy to manage the project\u2019s social and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n36.  The solar installations, which will be located on the rooftops of existing commercial and \nindustrial buildings, are considered to have minimal potential environmental impacts. Since the \nsolar panels will be located on the rooftops of buildings in commercial and industrial areas, it is \nconfirmed that there will be no need to acquire land and no potential adverse impacts on \nindigenous peoples\u2019 land.
