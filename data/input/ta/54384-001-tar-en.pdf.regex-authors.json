INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  trade  facilitation \nimplementation in the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) through research and development, capacity building, and collaboration with the United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) for the conduct of \nthe Asia-Pacific Trade Facilitation Forum (APTFF).1 This will synergize the efforts of ADB\u2019s \nregional departments and the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) to improve and \nfacilitate cross-border trade. \n \n2.  The Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department\u2019s annual work plan for \n2020 identifies the TA as a priority project. It will complement (i) trade facilitation initiatives in \nother  ADB  departments  and  in  subregional  programs  such  as  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation  (CAREC),  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  and  South  Asia \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC);2 and  (ii)  the  memorandum  of  understanding \nbetween ADB and ESCAP, which identifies trade facilitation as a priority area of collaboration.3 \nThe Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020 also prioritizes \nstronger connectivity between economies through trade facilitation.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  It  is  well  documented  that  trade  facilitation  measures  help  raise  efficiency  and \ntransparency  in  cross-border  trade,  lowering  trade  costs  and  boosting  trade  flows.  Full \nimplementation  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  can \nreduce trade costs by 9% on average, or up to 16% if digital trade facilitation measures are \nimplemented. 5  The  largest  gains  are  expected  for  developing  economies  lagging  in \nimplementation  of  digital  trade  facilitation.  Paperless  trade  measures  can  facilitate \nmainstreaming of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) into international value chains, \nwhich promotes more inclusive employment and development. Pursuit of these measures aligns \nwell with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, in addition to improving trade competitiveness of countries and \nbringing them closer to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.6 \n \n \n1 ADB has supported the APTFF since 2009, which has enabled the participation of government officials and \nresource persons from the DMCs. Organizers have held nine forums so far, the last one in 2019 in New Delhi, \nIndia. Asia Regional Integration Center.

Manila.  \n6 Advancement of trade facilitation measures falls under operational priority 7 (fostering regional cooperation and \nintegration) of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The implementation of these measures is expected to improve services at \nrelated government offices, which aligns with operational priority 6 (strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity). ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the \nPacific. Manila.  \n ", "2 \n4.  Paperless  trade  measures  also  enhance  access  to  finance\u2014a  critical  constraint  in \ntrade\u2015through innovative financial technologies for SMEs with limited access to formal banking \nsystems.7 Digital  financial  technologies,  or  fintech,  give  rise  to  an  array  of  applications  in \nfinancial services, such as payment, financing, asset management, and financial advice. These \ntechnologies help address the main challenges in trade finance provision, including process \ninefficiency,  regulatory  compliance,  and  information  asymmetry,  thus  lowering  the  costly \ncustomer due diligence requirements for banks. \n \n5.  Economies in Asia and the Pacific are steadily implementing trade facilitation measures, \nalthough  much  remains  to  be  done. Overall  trade  facilitation  implementation  in the  region \nincreased from 49% in 2017 to 59% in 2019.8 But subregional implementation rates vary, with \nhigher rates in Australia and New Zealand (93%) and East Asia high (79%), but lower rates in \nCentral Asia (66%), South Asia (55%), and the Pacific (36%). Moreover, measures for cross-\nborder paperless trade and inclusive trade are lagging. Cross-border paperless trade measures \nare implemented only 40% on average and often on a pilot basis. Low implementation rates are \nalso observed for trade facilitation for agriculture (50%), SMEs (36%), and female-owned firms \n(23%). Measures for trade finance facilitation are found to be rarely implemented. \n   \n6.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a major impact on international \ntrade, forecast to fall 9.2% in 2020, and has exposed vulnerabilities in the world trading system.9 \nLockdowns and transport restrictions have disrupted supply chains and hampered cross-border \ntrade of essential food and medical supplies as well as key income-generating products. For \ncustoms and logistics, the prevalence of manual submissions, paper-based filings, physical \ninterface points, and lack of coordination mechanisms constrains trade activity. The pandemic \nhas also revealed (i) the lack of emergency protocols in trade; (ii) a need for a holistic approach \nin transparency, information sharing, transportation, logistics, and transit facilitation; and (iii) the \nneed to expedite digital trade reforms. \n \n7.  A  digital  transformation  in  trade  and  trade  facilitation  will  likely  accelerate  in  the \naftermath of the pandemic. Trade facilitation is already one of the main strategic and operational \npriorities in ADB\u2019s subregional programs, including CAREC, GMS, and SASEC (footnote 2). \nThese  priorities  can  be  further  strengthened  when  post-COVID-19  policy  lessons  and \nimplications are linked up with existing or renewed agendas and potentially shared among the \nsubregional programs. \n \n8.  The  transition  to  the  \u201cnew  normal\u201d  after  the  COVID-19  pandemic  will  require  a \nknowledge  base  for  forward-looking  trade  facilitation  policy  making  as  well  as  enhanced \ncapacity building for stakeholders, including customs and trade officials. DMCs will benefit from \nbuilding  more  resilient  supply  chains  with  enhanced  information  sharing,  adequate  digital \ninfrastructure, and regulatory systems to implement digital trade facilitation. It is also important \nto  promote  greater  access  to  trade  finance  for  SMEs  disproportionately  impacted  by  the \n \n7 The rejection rate of bank-intermediated trade finance applications in 2019 for SMEs was 45%, compared to 39% \nfor large companies and 17% for multinational corporations.

The TA is aligned with the following impacts: opportunities for trade and trade facilitation \nagenda  advanced  (footnote  4),10 and  economic  opportunities  for  SMEs,  especially  those \nmanaged  by  women  entrepreneurs,  increased.11 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome: \ndesign and implementation of DMC trade facilitation measures, especially in paperless trade, \nimproved.12 The outcome will be measured in terms of trade facilitation policies that DMCs will \nadopt. These measures will focus on (i) cross-border paperless trade as part of forward-looking \npolicies and (ii) SMEs to help them and women entrepreneurs benefit from the improved trade \nenvironment. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Best  practices  and  benefits  of  trade  facilitation  and  trade  finance \nadvocated and disseminated. The TA will support the conduct of the APTFF in 2021 and 2023 \nto  continue  to  provide  venues  for  policy  dialogues  that  enable  the  sharing  of  knowledge, \nexperiences, and lessons among public and private stakeholders, including industry or trade \nassociations  that  represent  SMEs  and/or  large  businesses.13 Various  topics  that  will  be \ndiscussed at the APTFFs include (i) opportunities for the future trade facilitation agenda, such \nas  cross-border  paperless  trade  and  innovative  applications  of  emerging  technologies  for \nsustainable progress of the region; and (ii) challenges ahead in materializing such opportunities. \nTo better understand the critical role of access to finance in inclusive and sustainable trade, a \nsession on trade finance will be included in the agenda for at least one APTFF in consultation \nwith ADB\u2019s Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program, which is part of the PSOD. \n \n10.  Output 2: Capacities of trade agencies to initiate digital trade and trade facilitation \nmeasures enhanced. The TA will collaborate with ADB\u2019s regional departments and relevant \ntechnical groups to organize and determine capacity building activities for key government \nofficials during the APTFFs. In addition, the TA will also organize and support two subregional \nmeetings  (i)  to  bridge  knowledge  gaps  based  on  the  feedback  from  the  capacity  building \nparticipants during the APTFFs; (ii) to cater to trade and trade facilitation issues and challenges \nspecific  to  the  subregions;  and  (iii)  to  explore  synergies  with  ADB-supported  subregional \ninitiatives such as CAREC, GMS, and SASEC. In designing the capacity building events, the TA \nwill likewise consult with regional departments and collaborate with the subregional programs; \nthink tanks; and international organizations like ESCAP, the WTO, and the World Customs \nOrganization to better align with operational goals and subregional strategies. \n \n10 ADB. 2019.

The organizers will monitor the situation and coordinate to determine the most desirable \ncourse of action given the circumstances. \n ", "4 \n \n11.  Output  3:  Research  and  assessment  on  developments  in  trade  facilitation \npromoted and disseminated. The TA will conduct five background studies related to post-\nCOVID-19 trade recovery and the long-term trade facilitation agenda for sustainable trade \nfacilitation, focusing on forward-looking trade facilitation research topics with high impacts on \ninclusiveness.  Suggested  research  areas  include  (i)  strengthening  digital  trade  and  trade \nfacilitation, (ii) investigating the role of trade facilitation during crises in vulnerable sectors, (iii) \nsecuring more resilient supply chains, (iv) strengthening support for access to trade finance \nusing emerging technology, and (v) adopting an integrated approach for trade and transport \nfacilitation. The possible research areas and methodologies will be further discussed internally \nwithin ADB, particularly with regional departments, to ensure they are timely and relevant to \nADB operations. As part of the background studies, ADB and ESCAP will jointly produce new \neditions of the Asia-Pacific Trade Facilitation Report for dissemination during the APTFFs. Key \nresearch findings will also be shared with other ADB departments and disseminated through the \nsubregional workshops and other relevant ADB events.  \n  \n12.  Knowledge  products  will  comprise  mostly  digital  publications.  Printed  external \npublications will be printed for targeted government officials and requestors on demand. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $375,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Fund (TASF 6) and $375,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by TASF-other sources. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA.
