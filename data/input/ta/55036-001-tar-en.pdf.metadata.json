INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to promote innovative financing \nfor key ecosystem protection and restoration (EPR) projects.1 The TA will support policy advice, \npropose financing options for selected EPR investments, and facilitate knowledge sharing on \ninnovative market-based financing of EPR investments.2 The TA complements ADB\u2019s support to \nthe PRC in ecological compensation and green finance. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Many years of accelerated growth have enabled the PRC to become an upper middle-\nincome country and the world\u2019s second-largest economy, eradicating extreme poverty, and \ndeveloping  modern  physical  and  economic  infrastructure.  The  country\u2019s  unprecedented \ndevelopment progress has, however, come at a cost to the environment. The environmental \nchallenges arising from the rapid economic expansion have disproportionally affected the low-\nincome  population  and  vulnerable  ecosystems.3 In  this  regard,  the  efforts  on  biodiversity \nconservation, which are vital for sustainable development and rural revitalization, can have \nsignificant direct impacts on human health. This has become particularly important given the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.4 \n \n3.  Cognizant of the importance of an increased focus on protecting the country\u2019s environment, \nthe government has moved toward building an ecological civilization\u2014a concept rooted in the \nbelief that people must live in harmony with nature.5 In this context, progress has been made in \nimproving  vegetation,  soil,  and  water  quality  of  the  ecosystems  mainly  through  eco-\ncompensation\u2014the government\u2019s major market-based mechanism to finance green development \nat central and provincial levels.6 Despite the progress, the level of investment in natural capital \nremains inadequate to reverse the trend of environmental degradation. In this regard, it is \nimportant to increase social capital investment (private firms, state-owned enterprises, collective \nfarms, international financial institutions) in natural capital to diversify the funding sources, \naugment the government\u2019s funding, and create incentives for behavior changes to achieve \ndesirable outcomes for ecosystems.7 \n \n4.  Accelerating  green  and  low-carbon  development  and  strengthening  ecological \nconservation is a policy priority of the government, which has also adopted policies to promote \n \n1  Government of the PRC.

Manila. \n \n ", "2 \nnew funding sources and innovative financing solutions for public investments, including in EPR.8 \nIn 2020, the government adopted a 15-year master plan on EPR (footnote 1), which promotes \ninnovative and diversified investment, facilitates the emergence of long-term multi-stakeholder \nfunding  mechanisms  for  EPR  projects,  and  envisages  that  EPR  projects  should  promote \ngreenhouse emission reduction for eventual carbon emission trading.9 The PRC\u2019s National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC) is the government\u2019s lead agency responsible for \nimplementing the EPR master plan. \n \n5.  Efficient and effective realization of the EPR master plan\u2019s agenda to scale up social \ncapital investment in EPR is constrained by (i) insufficient mechanisms and policies for value \nrealization of ecosystem products and services;10 (ii) a weak enabling environment for innovative \nEPR  investment  financing,  mainly  attributed  to  the  lack  of  an  operational  framework  and \nguidelines to value ecosystem products and services as investment assets and to incentivize \nprivate investment in such assets; (iii) a lack of a pipeline of innovative finance EPR projects \nbecause of the weak capacity in financial structuring of such projects and inadequate knowledge \non funding options; and (iv) an overall weak awareness on innovative financing of EPR projects \nbecause of a lack of knowledge sharing. The TA will help the NDRC address these constraints. \n \n6.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 3 and ADB\u2019s \nClimate Change Operational Framework 2017\u20132030 and is aligned with the strategic priorities of \nADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy, 2021\u20132025.11 The TA will complement and build on \nADB\u2019s comprehensive past and ongoing support to the PRC in eco-compensation and green \nfinance. Based on the One ADB approach, the TA will promote innovation by providing policy \nadvice  on  new  ways  of  catalyzing  private  finance  solutions  for  EPR  projects,  including \ninvestments related to nature-based carbon sequestration.12 The TA\u2019s findings may inform the \nprogramming of ADB\u2019s sovereign and nonsovereign operations in the PRC. The TA is also \nexpected to have a replication potential in the PRC and in other developing member countries \n(DMCs). \n   \n \n8  Government of the PRC. 2020.

Carbon dioxide is \nnaturally captured from the atmosphere through biological, chemical, and physical processes.  \n \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA will be aligned with the following impact: social capital investment in EPR projects \nincreased (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: policies and management on \ninnovative13 finance for EPR investment improved.14 \n \n8.  The TA will focus on EPR projects in the Ningxia, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jilin \nprovinces that come from the EPR master plan, including in preparing preliminary business cases \nfor selected EPR projects in these provinces. The selection of the provinces is to enable \nconsideration of different ecological protection and economic development contexts to enable the \nTA\u2019s policy advice to be relevant for various parts of the PRC. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Innovative financing solutions for ecosystem protection and restoration \ninvestment promoted. Based on EPR specifics of the selected provinces, output 1 will support \nthe preparation of policy-oriented research papers on promoting innovative financing of EPR \ninvestments and EPR-related carbon sequestration. The research on carbon sequestration will \nbe synchronized in time with the workplans of NDRC on carbon sequestration and neutrality \nactivities.15 The research papers will be based on the review of (i) the national and provincial \nframeworks on EPR, public investment, and investment financing;16 (ii) the viability of EPR \nproducts  and  services  as  investment  assets;  (iii)  the  supply  and  demand  sides  of  such \ninvestments (including incentives and constraints);17 and (iv) the applicable international best \npractice.18 \n \n10.  Output 2: Options on innovative ecosystem protection and restoration investment \nfinancing proposed. Output 2 will support the preparation of five preliminary business cases for \nattracting debt and equity financing for selected EPR projects, including suggestions on the \ncatalytic  support  from  ADB  at  project  level  and  to  develop  EPR  funding  schemes  and  \ninstruments.19 Among possible funding instruments and schemes could be environmental impact \nbonds, domestic biodiversity investment funds, and partnerships with multinational or global funds \nrelated to EPR and carbon emission reduction. \n \n13  Innovation means a change that adds value for clients.

New York. \n18  This will involve review of the financing solutions and funding schemes in the United States and the European Union \ngiven their established experience in private financing of EPR investments, including in reducing emissions from \ndeforestation and forest degradation, plus the sustainable management of forests, and the conservation and \nenhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+). \n19  A preliminary business case would discuss the need and benefits of the project, suitability of the proposed technical \nsolution,  economic  feasibility,  suitability  for  private  financing,  affordability,  project  readiness,  and  project \nmanagement plan. \n \n ", "4 \n11.  Output  3:  Knowledge  on  innovative  ecosystem  protection  and  restoration \ninvestment financing enhanced. Output 3 will support capacity building and consultation events \non innovative financing solutions and funding schemes for EPR projects (including reducing \nemissions from deforestation and forest degradation, plus the sustainable management of forests, \nand the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks [REDD+] projects) and on multi-\nstakeholder consultations on the financing of selected EPR projects.20 Output 3 will also support \n(i) study tours of NDRC staff to learn from successful experiences on innovative EPR financing \nand EPR-based carbon sequestration,21 and (ii) preparation of knowledge products on innovative \nfinancing of EPR investments in English and Chinese\u2014to share findings and recommendations \nwithin the PRC and with other ADB DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $660,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), $150,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund,22 and $150,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.23 The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace and supplies, secretarial assistance, venues for activities, information and communication \nfacilities for consultants, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  the  Public  Management,  Financial  Sector,  and \nRegional Cooperation Division of the East Asia Department. The Rural Economy Department of \nNDRC will be the executing agency for the TA. The implementation arrangements are summarized \nin the table. \n \n \n20  The TA will synergize with ADB TA for Sustainable Infrastructure for Asia and the Pacific, which covers the blue \neconomy infrastructure investments. The blue economy is sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, \nimproved livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health.
