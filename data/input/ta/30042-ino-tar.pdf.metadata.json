INTRODUCTION\n1. The Bank's 1995 Country Programming Mission to the Republic of Indonesia was\nrequested by the Government to provide technical assistance (TA) to carry out an electricity tariff\nrationalization study. In May 1996, a Bank Mission visited Indonesia and reached an\nunderstanding with the Government on the scope, approach, implementation, and financing\narrangements for the TA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Indonesia has recorded the highest sustained growth in power demand among the Bank's\ndeveloping member countries (DMC5). In the period 1973 to 1995, electricity sales of the public\nutility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) grew at an average annual rate of 16 percent, i. e., they\ndoubled every five years. Despite energy efficiency improvements and demand-side\nmanagement (DSM) measures, including significant electricity tariff increases, growth in the first\nhalf of the 1990s was only slightly below that in the previous years. The fastest growth was\nexperienced in the industry sector, indicating that the major part of the additional electricity\nprovided was used for productive purposes to support Indonesia's steady economic growth that\naveraged 7 percent per annum in the said period. At the same time, the Government and PLN\ngave attention to rural electrification as well, and, mainly as a result of large-scale rural\nelectrification, the number of new consumers connected by PLN has exceeded 1 million per year\nsince the mid-1980s. The total number of PLN's consumers rose from about 1 million in 1973\nto over 19 million in 1995.\n3. In view of the country's heavy (but declining) reliance on oil prOducts, the Bank supports\nthe Government's energy policy of conserving oil reserves by promoting the development of\nother indigenous energy resources for domestic use. The Bank has been helping the\nGovernment to pursue this policy mainly through assistance for the diversification of the power\ngeneration mix. The Bank's present policy thrust in the power subsector aims at (i)\ncommercialization and phased privatization, (ii) mobilization of private sector investments, (iii)\nintegrated resource planning and DSM, (iv) increased supply-side efficiency and rehabilitation\nof existing facilities, (v) reducing the disparity between Java and the other islands, (vi)\nsustainable development of the hydropower and geothermal potential, (vii) minimizing\nenvironmental impact, (viii) gradually phasing out subsidies, and (ix) development of human\nresources. Given the keen interest of the private sector in thermal power projects, the Bank is\nincreasingly focusing its operations on hydropower development, power transmission and\ndistribution (including interregional and interisland interconnections), and DSM initiatives.\n4. The principal agency responsible for implementing Government energy policies is the\nMinistry of Mines and Energy (MME). In the energy sector, MME coordinates activities and\nsupervises such state enterprises as Perusahaan Tambang Minyak Nasional (PERTAMINA) for\noil, natural gas, and geothermal power development; PT. Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam for coal\ndevelopment; PT. Gas Negara for gas transmission and distribution; and PLN for power\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. Other ministries and agencies involved in the sector\ninclude the Ministry of Public Works, responsible for hydropower resource survey and the\nThe TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in March 1996.", "operation of multipurpose hydropower plants, and the National Atomic Energy Commission. An\ninterministerial National Energy Board (BAKOREN), chaired by the Minister of Mines and Energy,\ncoordinates energy policies with those of other sectors. BAKOREN is supported by a Technical\nCommittee, chaired by the Director General of the Directorate General of Electricity and Energy\nDevelopment (DGEED) of MME.\n5. Indonesia's power subsector consists of (i) PLN, the state-owned electricity corporation;\n(ii) a large number of plants installed and operated by industries for their own use; (iii) three\nGovernment-sponsored electric cooperatives in rural areas; and (iv) a large number (over\n17,000) of unregistered micro enterprises at the village level. The legal framework of the\nsubsector is provided by the Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985). The Act permits establishment\nof private power producers, distributors, and licensees. Presidential Decree No. 37/1992\nspecifically authorizes private sector participation under build-own-operate (BOO) schemes, and\nother legal entities to generate, transmit, and distribute power for public use.\n6. Following the change of its status in October 1994 from Perum (state corporation without\nauthority to issue shares) to Persero (limited liability company whose shares can eventually be\nowned by private investors), PLN has created two subsidiaries for power generation in Java and\nis considering a joint-venture with PERTAMINA for geothermal power development. These are\nimportant steps that will help to enhance transparency in subsidies, promote private sector\ninvestments from the domestic and international capital markets, and introduce competition to\nimprove the operational and financial efficiency of the subsector.\n7. The power subsector is regulated by DGEED. Given the entrance of private power\nprodUcers, the change of PLN's status from Perum to Persero, and its eventual breakup into\nseparate autonomous regional and functional units or companies, there is a need to strengthen\nthe regulatory function and to enhance its independence. The Government intends to form by\nDecember 1996 a new Directorate within DGEED with exclusive responsibility for power\nsubsector regulation and to endow it with greater powers and independence.\n8. Electricity tariffs in Indonesia are regulated by the Government. The current tariff\nschedule became effective on 1 November 1994. The schedule, which is applied uniformly\nthroughout the country, comprises 24 tariff categories. For all but three categories (very small\nsocial institutions, temporary connections, and street lights), the tariff consists of a demand\ncharge based on kilovolt-amperes (kVA) of connected load and an energy charge related to\nkilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed. Time-of-day pricing is adopted for medium and large industrial\nconsumers, large commercial consumers, large social institutions, and large office buildings. The\npast dialogue on electricity tariffs focused on the introduction of a periodic tariff adjustment\nmechanism to capture variations in PLN's input costs of fuel, purchased power, inflation, and\nexchange rates. The adoption of such a mechanism in November 1994, based on a Bank-\nfinanced TA,1 has provided a level of protection to PLN's revenues in real terms and has made\ntariff adjustments more transparent. Though average revenue has kept pace with inflation since\nTA No. 1330-I NO: Study on Electric Tariff Adjustment Mechanism, for $100,000, approved on 29 June 1990.", "3\n1992, the 1995 average revenue of Rp163 per kWh ($0.070 per kWh), was slightly below that\nof other Southeast Asian utilities.1\n9. There are substantial cross-subsidies between small residential consumers, particularly\nin rural areas, and medium-size commercial and industrial consumers. In 1995, small residential\ncustomers representing 76.7 percent of PLN's 19.5 million customers, consumed 19.5 percent\nof the total electricity supplied, paid an average tariff of Rp129 per kWh, and contributed 15.4\npercent of total revenue. Industrial customers representing 0.2 percent of consumers consumed\n47.6 percent of electricity supplied, paid an average tariff of Rp143 per kWh and contributed 41.8\npercent of total revenue. Commercial customers representing 3.2 percent of consumers\nconsumed 10.2 percent of electricity supplied, paid an average tariff of Rp264 per kWh, and\ncontributed 16.6 percent of total revenue. There are also cross-subsidies between the Java-Bali\ngrid and systems in the other islands as uniform tariffs are applied throughout the country. In\n1995, Java-Bali operations earned a net income of Rp2.3 trillion, while a loss of Rpl.3 trillion\nwas sustained in the other systems. The Government intends to phase out the cross-subsidies\nbetween consumer categories and replace them with transparent and direct subsidies from its\nbudget for carefully targeted low-income groups. Regarding the cross-subsidies between Java-\nBali and the other islands, their extent is gradually diminishing because of the expansion and\ngrowing interconnection of the latter.systems, diversification of their power generation mix,\nincrease in load densities, and improvements in supply-side efficiencies.\n10. The Government wishes to thoroughly review the cross-subsidies in the context of the\nconversion of PLN from Perum to Persero, the financial burden of PLN in carrying out socially\noriented activities such as rural electrification, and the emerging competition between PLN and\nprivate power producers. The Bank can play an important role in this area by helping gradually\nphase out the cross-subsidies and develop appropriate delivery mechanisms for direct subsidies\nfrom the Government to low-income groups and for socially mandated activities to enable PLN\nto compete and perform efficiently in the increasingly market-oriented environment. In this\ncontext, it is particularly important that PLN gives the right tariff signals to retain in its system the\nhigh value commercial and industrial consumers. PLN has already prepared for submission to\nthe Government a base tariff increase in 1996, including a proposal for some tariff restructuring\nas the first step toward reducing the cross-subsidies between the various consumer categories.\nUI. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n11. The TA aims to (i) analyze in detail the nature and extent of the prevailing cross-subsidies\nand the social impact of eliminating them; and (ii) in the context of the ongoing privatization\nprogram, develop an appropriate medium-term strategy, together with a time-bound program,\nThailand (Metropolitan Electricity Authority) - $0072 per kWh; Korea (Korea Electric Power Co.) \u2014$0075\nper kWh; Singapore (Public Utility Board) - $0075 per kWh; Taipei,China (Taipower) \u2014$0082 per kWh;\nHongkong (China Light and Power Co.) - $0086 per kWh; Malaysia (Tenaga Negara Berhard) - $0088\nper kWh; and Philippines (Manila Electric Company) - $0114 per kWh.", "4\nfor gradually phasing out the cross-subsidies and replacing them with direct subsidies, where\nnecessitated by social and equity considerations.\nB.\t Scope\n12. An implementation group of international and local experts, and counterpart staff from\nDGEED and PLN will be established to (i) review and update long-run marginal costs of\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution; (ii) analyze existing and projected cross-subsidies\nbetween consumer categories and regions, and asses their impacts; (iii) perform a social impact\nanalysis of vulnerable groups to recommend limits on acceptable levels of welfare loss; (iv)\ndevelop a time-bound program for phasing out cross-subsidies and replacing them with direct\nand transparent Government subsidies, if necessary; (v) develop effective mechanisms for\ntransparently delivering subsidies to the targeted low-income groups; and (vi) recommend an\nappropriate strategy and mechanisms for delivery of direct subsidies.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost is estimated at $399,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of\n$286,700 and a local currency cost of $112,300 equivalent (see Appendix 1 for details). The\nforeign exchange cost and the cost of domestic consultants, amounting to $353,000 equivalent,\nwill be financed by the Bank as a grant and the amount of $46,000 equivalent will be borne by\nthe Government to meet the remaining local currency cost, covering local transport, counterpart\nstaff (including translators), and office space.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. The terms of reference for the consultants are presented in Appendix 2. The study will\nbe carried out by an international consulting firm with experience in economic, financial, and\nsocial analyses; electricity tariff design; and administration of subsidies in the power subsector.\nThe team from this firm will consist of a power economist, a social impact analyst, and an\ninstitutional specialist, assisted by three domestic consultants specialized in the same areas. The\nstudy will require about ten person-months of international consulting services and eight person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. The consultants will work in close collaboration with\nDGEED and PLN and ensure effective know-how transfer. The international consultants will be\nrecruited in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The domestic\nconsultants will be subcontracted by the international consultants.\n15. DGEED will be the Executing Agency. It will provide adequate office space and facilities\nin Jakarta for the use of the consultants, while PLN will provide the necessary input data for the\nstudy. DGEED and PLN will assign a full-time team of counterpart staff for the study duration.\nDGEED will also liaise with other public and private sector agencies.\n16. The study is expected to commence in December 1996 and be completed within six\nmonths, i. e., by June 1997. The consultants will submit, within two weeks of commencement,\nan inception report detailing the proposed methodology and work plan.

Given the entrance of private power\nprodUcers, the change of PLN's status from Perum to Persero, and its eventual breakup into\nseparate autonomous regional and functional units or companies, there is a need to strengthen\nthe regulatory function and to enhance its independence. The Government intends to form by\nDecember 1996 a new Directorate within DGEED with exclusive responsibility for power\nsubsector regulation and to endow it with greater powers and independence.\n8. Electricity tariffs in Indonesia are regulated by the Government. The current tariff\nschedule became effective on 1 November 1994. The schedule, which is applied uniformly\nthroughout the country, comprises 24 tariff categories. For all but three categories (very small\nsocial institutions, temporary connections, and street lights), the tariff consists of a demand\ncharge based on kilovolt-amperes (kVA) of connected load and an energy charge related to\nkilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed. Time-of-day pricing is adopted for medium and large industrial\nconsumers, large commercial consumers, large social institutions, and large office buildings. The\npast dialogue on electricity tariffs focused on the introduction of a periodic tariff adjustment\nmechanism to capture variations in PLN's input costs of fuel, purchased power, inflation, and\nexchange rates. The adoption of such a mechanism in November 1994, based on a Bank-\nfinanced TA,1 has provided a level of protection to PLN's revenues in real terms and has made\ntariff adjustments more transparent. Though average revenue has kept pace with inflation since\nTA No. 1330-I NO: Study on Electric Tariff Adjustment Mechanism, for $100,000, approved on 29 June 1990.", "3\n1992, the 1995 average revenue of Rp163 per kWh ($0.070 per kWh), was slightly below that\nof other Southeast Asian utilities.1\n9. There are substantial cross-subsidies between small residential consumers, particularly\nin rural areas, and medium-size commercial and industrial consumers. In 1995, small residential\ncustomers representing 76.7 percent of PLN's 19.5 million customers, consumed 19.5 percent\nof the total electricity supplied, paid an average tariff of Rp129 per kWh, and contributed 15.4\npercent of total revenue. Industrial customers representing 0.2 percent of consumers consumed\n47.6 percent of electricity supplied, paid an average tariff of Rp143 per kWh and contributed 41.8\npercent of total revenue. Commercial customers representing 3.2 percent of consumers\nconsumed 10.2 percent of electricity supplied, paid an average tariff of Rp264 per kWh, and\ncontributed 16.6 percent of total revenue. There are also cross-subsidies between the Java-Bali\ngrid and systems in the other islands as uniform tariffs are applied throughout the country. In\n1995, Java-Bali operations earned a net income of Rp2.3 trillion, while a loss of Rpl.3 trillion\nwas sustained in the other systems. The Government intends to phase out the cross-subsidies\nbetween consumer categories and replace them with transparent and direct subsidies from its\nbudget for carefully targeted low-income groups. Regarding the cross-subsidies between Java-\nBali and the other islands, their extent is gradually diminishing because of the expansion and\ngrowing interconnection of the latter.systems, diversification of their power generation mix,\nincrease in load densities, and improvements in supply-side efficiencies.\n10. The Government wishes to thoroughly review the cross-subsidies in the context of the\nconversion of PLN from Perum to Persero, the financial burden of PLN in carrying out socially\noriented activities such as rural electrification, and the emerging competition between PLN and\nprivate power producers. The Bank can play an important role in this area by helping gradually\nphase out the cross-subsidies and develop appropriate delivery mechanisms for direct subsidies\nfrom the Government to low-income groups and for socially mandated activities to enable PLN\nto compete and perform efficiently in the increasingly market-oriented environment. In this\ncontext, it is particularly important that PLN gives the right tariff signals to retain in its system the\nhigh value commercial and industrial consumers. PLN has already prepared for submission to\nthe Government a base tariff increase in 1996, including a proposal for some tariff restructuring\nas the first step toward reducing the cross-subsidies between the various consumer categories.\nUI. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n11. The TA aims to (i) analyze in detail the nature and extent of the prevailing cross-subsidies\nand the social impact of eliminating them; and (ii) in the context of the ongoing privatization\nprogram, develop an appropriate medium-term strategy, together with a time-bound program,\nThailand (Metropolitan Electricity Authority) - $0072 per kWh; Korea (Korea Electric Power Co.) \u2014$0075\nper kWh; Singapore (Public Utility Board) - $0075 per kWh; Taipei,China (Taipower) \u2014$0082 per kWh;\nHongkong (China Light and Power Co.) - $0086 per kWh; Malaysia (Tenaga Negara Berhard) - $0088\nper kWh; and Philippines (Manila Electric Company) - $0114 per kWh.", "4\nfor gradually phasing out the cross-subsidies and replacing them with direct subsidies, where\nnecessitated by social and equity considerations.\nB.\t Scope\n12. An implementation group of international and local experts, and counterpart staff from\nDGEED and PLN will be established to (i) review and update long-run marginal costs of\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution; (ii) analyze existing and projected cross-subsidies\nbetween consumer categories and regions, and asses their impacts; (iii) perform a social impact\nanalysis of vulnerable groups to recommend limits on acceptable levels of welfare loss; (iv)\ndevelop a time-bound program for phasing out cross-subsidies and replacing them with direct\nand transparent Government subsidies, if necessary; (v) develop effective mechanisms for\ntransparently delivering subsidies to the targeted low-income groups; and (vi) recommend an\nappropriate strategy and mechanisms for delivery of direct subsidies.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost is estimated at $399,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of\n$286,700 and a local currency cost of $112,300 equivalent (see Appendix 1 for details). The\nforeign exchange cost and the cost of domestic consultants, amounting to $353,000 equivalent,\nwill be financed by the Bank as a grant and the amount of $46,000 equivalent will be borne by\nthe Government to meet the remaining local currency cost, covering local transport, counterpart\nstaff (including translators), and office space.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. The terms of reference for the consultants are presented in Appendix 2. The study will\nbe carried out by an international consulting firm with experience in economic, financial, and\nsocial analyses; electricity tariff design; and administration of subsidies in the power subsector.\nThe team from this firm will consist of a power economist, a social impact analyst, and an\ninstitutional specialist, assisted by three domestic consultants specialized in the same areas. The\nstudy will require about ten person-months of international consulting services and eight person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. The consultants will work in close collaboration with\nDGEED and PLN and ensure effective know-how transfer. The international consultants will be\nrecruited in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The domestic\nconsultants will be subcontracted by the international consultants.\n15. DGEED will be the Executing Agency. It will provide adequate office space and facilities\nin Jakarta for the use of the consultants, while PLN will provide the necessary input data for the\nstudy. DGEED and PLN will assign a full-time team of counterpart staff for the study duration.\nDGEED will also liaise with other public and private sector agencies.\n16. The study is expected to commence in December 1996 and be completed within six\nmonths, i. e., by June 1997. The consultants will submit, within two weeks of commencement,\nan inception report detailing the proposed methodology and work plan. The draft final report will\nbe submitted at the beginning of the fifth month, and will be discussed at a meeting between the\nGovernment, PLN, the Bank, and the consultants.
