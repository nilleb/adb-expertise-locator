During 2002 and 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) carried out regional studies1 \non  small-scale  private  water  providers  (SSPWPs).  The  objectives  were  to  (i)  provide  an \noverview of urban water suppliers beyond formal water utilities, (ii) increase knowledge about \nthe  type  of  services  provided  by  SSPWPs,  (iii)  define  the  profile  of  the  most  significant \nSSPWPs, and (iv) assess the main constraints on and potential of SSPWPs. The studies were \ncarried out in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Shanghai, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); Delhi, India; \nJakarta, Indonesia; Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Kathmandu, Nepal; Manila and Cebu, Philippines; \nand Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. \n \n2.  The results were published by ADB in 2004.2 The studies concluded that city officials, \ncity water utilities, and local banks should work with small network entrepreneurs who can bring \nwater supplies to the poor and disadvantaged immediately, on an agreed-upon interim basis \nuntil  the  water  utility  is  able  to  do  so.  These  small  networks  should  be  included  in  city \ndevelopment  strategies  and  formalized  with  licensing  and  exit  strategies  and  takeout \nagreements. Minimum standards should recognize risk and payback requirements. Enabling \nlegal and contractual conditions should be created and small operators should be integrated into \nthe water supply chain to the extent possible. Finally, the study concluded that ADB should join \nwith two or three cities to test and refine these recommendations during 2005\u20132006. This \ntechnical assistance (TA), which is targeting three cities in three countries, will implement four \npilot projects for small piped water networks (SPWNs) and water supply services surveys that \nwill facilitate upscaling of the pilot projects.3 The ADB Fact-finding Mission visited the three \ncountries in March\u2013June 2005 and reached understandings with the governments concerned, \nlocal government representatives, potential nongovernment organization (NGO) participants, \ncivil society stakeholders, and small-scale water providers (SSWPs) on the purpose, design, \nmethodology, and implementing agencies for the TA. The TA design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In the Asia and Pacific region, another 700 million people need to receive water supply \nto reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).4 To achieve the MDG targets by 2015, \nmany developing member countries (DMCs) acknowledge that it is important to reach Target 10 \non water and sanitation by 2010. The economic impact of improved piped water supply on \nhealth and education is significant.5 While ADB-supported projects in some DMCs, for example \nPhnom Penh in Cambodia and Dalian in the PRC, have achieved 24-hour water supply, many \nutilities in other DMCs have low levels of coverage. At five persons per connection, the effective \ncoverage with piped connections in 20016 was 10% in Dhaka, 32% in Ho Chi Minh City, 31% in \nJakarta, 32% in Manila, and 46% in Delhi. People who are not connected often pay water \nvendors about 15% of their household income for delivery of water, buying water from their \n                                                 \n1  The studies were funded under ADB. 2002.

ADB publications (footnote 2) and experience of the World Bank and other agencies in \nLatin America and Africa reported that there are many issues  in addressing the immediate \nneeds of the poor and those living in peri-urban areas, but the most typical are the following: (i) \non the outskirts of a city, utility piped water is not close and SSWP has to put down a borehole \nand independently serve the people; (ii) the utility is in the area, but only serves through a \nstandpipe/standpost;  by connecting to the utility, an SSWP can serve an area with direct house \nconnections; (iii) on the outskirts of a city, the utility is not far away so the SSWP can connect to \nutility water and extend the piped supply farther out; and (iv) the utility is serving the people but \nthe cost of connection is so high and the terms so steep that only half the people can afford to \nconnect to piped water; thus, the homeowners association (HOA) is looking for better financing \nterms. All these four scenarios will be studied by the pilot projects of the TA. \n \n5.  In all cases, the core issue is getting connected to piped water, promptly and on terms \naffordable to those living in peri-urban areas, especially the poor. Once connected, people will \npay only 1\u20132% of their household income for piped water. The implementation issue therefore is \nto find financing mechanisms that will be flexible and fast, and will respond to the needs of the \npeople. With SPWNs, there is the case where financing is required by the contractor/operator; in \nanother case financing is required by the HOA. With SSWPs, there is a need for regularization \n(maybe initially just by registration) and some control over the quality of construction and the \nresponsibilities for operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n6.  From ADB\u2019s perspective, there is the bigger issue of reaching peri-urban consumers \nthrough piped water supply in an expeditious manner. In this regard, the potential for upscaling \nthe pilot projects and mainstreaming and integrating SPWNs and SSWPs into both public and \nprivate sector loan projects will be important. These issues will be addressed by the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n7.  The TA will enable selected urban population in India, Philippines, and Viet Nam to \nquickly connect to piped water supply. The TA aims to assist in achieving the MDG Target 10 on \nsustainable access to safe drinking water.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  incorporates  five  strategic  approaches:  (i)  implementing  four  SPWN  pilot \nprojects; (ii) setting up a registration system for SSWPs; (iii) preparing an evaluation report on \nthe  implementation  of  the  four  SPWN  pilot  projects;  (iv)  organizing  regional  workshop  to \ndisseminate evaluation report, and (v) developing a tool kit to replicate SPWN efforts. \n \n9.  Output 1. Implementing four SPWN pilot projects in Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India;7  \nKabisig and Lupang Arenda in Metro Manila, Philippines; and Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. The \nfour pilot areas were selected based on regional representation, diversity of issues, available \n                                                 \n7  Two more pilot projects in the cities of Jabalpur and Indore in Madhya Pradesh are proposed for simultaneous \nimplementation with UN-HABITAT parallel funding under the ongoing Water for Asian Cities Program. This \nprogram is implemented together with ADB\u2019s Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement in Madhya \nPradesh. \n ", "  3\ninformation,  and  the  potential  for  upscaling.  In  each  pilot  project,  the  community  will  be \nrepresented by an HOA or its equivalent.  \n \n10.  In  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  pilot  project,  the  SSWP  has  already  developed  its  own \ngroundwater source and has negotiated tariffs with the water utility for bulk sale of water to the \nutility as well as distribution to customers. In the other pilot projects, the water utility will be \nproviding the water source and will sell the water in bulk to either the SSWP (Lupang Arenda) or \nthe HOA (Kabisig) as the case may be. The bulk rate is expected to be an equivalent residential \nrate. The water utility will enter into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the SSWP or the \nHOA for a specific time, after which it agrees to take over full responsibility for the O&M of the \nfacilities. The assets will, however, belong to the HOA or community who will have paid for them \nover a period of 5 years. The water utility or the relevant regulatory authority will be responsible \nfor agreeing to the standard of construction to be used. \n \n11.  The SSWP will enter into an MOA with the local authority to construct the SPWN and \noperate and maintain it. The HOA shall nominate the SSWP. \n \n12.  A local bank or other suitable financial intermediary with a branch close to the pilot \nproject will be nominated to be the recipient of the grant funds from ADB. The bank will onlend \nthe money to the SSWP or HOA as the case may be.8 It will receive at least once a week all \nrepayments of their loan from the SSWP or HOA, for SSWPs normally repay loans weekly, as \npoor consumers prefer to pay water tariffs daily or weekly. Once a month, the bank will report \nprogress to ADB and continue to do so for a period of 5 years, being the maximum time for \nrepayment of the original loans.9   \n \n13.  All physical pipework for each pilot project will be completed within 8-10 months of \ncommencing work. Except for the pilot project in India, each street will have a street meter and \neach household connection a house meter. As far as feasible, the SSWP or HOA will employ in \nthe operation of the new system, including the daily collection of dues (except in Ho Chi Minh \nCity), people such as water vendors who may have lost their job as a result of this intervention. \nMaterials will be procured directly by the SSWP contractor or utility, based on the specifications \napproved for that specific location by the water utility or the regulatory body. \n \n14.  The scope of assistance comprises consulting services to train the HOAs and SSWPs in \nthe construction and O&M of the new facilities. This assistance will be extended with the help of \nlocal government authorities, to all those who may at some time in the future take part in \nupscaling these activities. \n \n15.  ADB  will  request  a  no-objection  from  the  government  of  the  participating  countries \nbefore the TA is implemented. \n \n16.  Output 2. Setting up a registration system for existing SSWPs with the appropriate \nregistering  agency.  To  assist  the  Government  in  registering  all  SSWPS  and  to  set  up  a \n                                                 \n8  ADB may retain administrative charges from the grant as needed. No interest will be charged to the SSWP or the \nhomeowners association. \n9 At such time that ADB deems it appropriate, it may authorize the Government to use the monies paid back for   \nanother round of piped water connections to be made on the basis of a revolving fund. During fact-finding, the \nconcerned homeowners association confirmed that it is willing to borrow from local banks to improve the water \nsupply system. \n ", "4   \nregistration system, a comprehensive water supply service survey10 will be conducted, which \nwill include all types of users, including commercial and industrial. On completion of the survey, \nthe consultants will analyze the results and convene a stakeholder consultation, which will be \nthe basis for formulating policy and plans and Government\u2019s endorsement of providing further \nSPWN for communities not served by the formal water supply system. \n \n17.  Output 3. Evaluating the implementation of the four SPWN pilot projects. The evaluation \nreport will (i) show how many people benefited, to what degree, at what unit cost; (ii) present \nhow  quickly  the  project  was  implemented;  (iii)  identify  any  constraints  for  attention  during \nupscaling efforts; and (iv) assess replicability of the SPWN approach. It will also include the \ninitial assessment of the performance of HOAs or SSWPs in implementing the new facilties.  \n \n18.  Output 4. Organizing a regional workshop in Manila to disseminate the evaluation report \nto DMC key stakeholders to share their views, especially as to how best upscale the pilot \nprojects and mainstream and integrate them into ADB lending.   \n \n19.  Output 5. Developing a practical tool kit to help replicate efforts, and scale up SPWNs \nunder ADB\u2019s lending program to support DMCs to reach MDG Target 10. The tool kit will assist \nADB staff in designing water supply projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the project is estimated at $800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by (i) ADB\u2019s TA funding program in the amount of $200,000 equivalent, and (ii) \nthe Government of France in the amount of $200,000 equivalent, to be administered by ADB. \nThe Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector through an approved TA11 will finance the remaining \namount of $400,000 equivalent. HOAs will use their time and resources to help implement the \npilot projects. In addition, government regulatory agencies will provide assistance in kind. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The TA will be implemented by ADB. The Energy, Transport, and Water Division (RSID) \nof  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department,  in  cooperation  with  concerned \ndivisions  in  the  regional  departments  and  the  ADB  resident  missions  concerned,  will  be \nresponsible for all TA activities. A TA office will be established in RSID.  \n \n22.  A total of 30 person-months of domestic consultants will be needed for implementation. \nIn  each  of  the  three  participating  countries,  one  community-based  water  supply  specialist \n(domestic consultant) will supervise the implementation of the pilot projects, and a regulatory \nspecialist (domestic consultant) will be responsible for the conduct of the water services survey \nin each city. One water supply and sanitation specialist (domestic consultant) based in Manila \nwill coordinate all TA activities. The local banks or other city-based financial intermediaries in \neach pilot project will provide training on billing and collection of dues and basic financial \nanalysis for the communities and the SSWPs. The concerned water utility will give advice on \nconstruction and O&M of the facilities. An expert on water supply and sanitation (international \n                                                 \n10 These will be household surveys that will follow the model terms of reference created by ADB under the Financing \nWater Initiative. They will record how the household accesses water, how much it gets, how much the water costs, \nwater quality, reliability of supply, and the type of household sanitation. \n11 ADB. 2004.

This consultant will also assist in organizing and \nconducting the regional workshop. The required consultants will be recruited as individuals in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other terms acceptable to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for consulting services \nis in Appendix 3.12 \n \n23.  Materials and equipment to implement the pilot projects will be procured following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement and other terms acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \n24.  The TA will be implemented in 24 months, starting in November 2005 and ending in  \nOctober 2007. The pilot projects will be evaluated after the pilots have been in operation for 6 \nmonths. The regional workshop will be held in August 2007. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of France; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis for Implementing Pilot Projects for Small \nPiped Water Networks, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n12  External to this TA, an expert on water sector evaluation (international consultant), funded by the ADB Water \nCooperation Fund and employed by RSID will evaluate the pilot projects and conduct a regional workshop in \nManila to discuss and disseminate the findings.

For each pilot project, this consultant must \ncommunicate daily with the appropriate representatives of the community, the contractor and \nthe water provider as well as the local bank. Once a week, all these people should meet \nformally to discuss the progress of the pilot project with the officer of the government regulatory \nagency present. The consultant will take the minutes of this meeting and forward them to the TA \ncoordinator in Manila (via e-mail) with his/her own comments appended. This consultant will \ntrain the SSWP or HOAs in O&M of the completed facilities until such time as they are taken \nover by the water utility. The training participants will include those designated from within the \npilot project area, as well as representatives of the project area that will be involved in any later \nupscaling of the pilot projects. Two trainees are required from each pilot project: a technical \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nperson for supervising any construction and undertaking any maintenance, and a financial \nperson for recording consumption and payment on a daily basis and remitting payments to the \nlocal bank. Within the first month of the assignment, the consultant will propose a training plan \nthat will need to be endorsed by the community, the SSWP, the water utility, and the local bank \nbefore being submitted to ADB for approval.
