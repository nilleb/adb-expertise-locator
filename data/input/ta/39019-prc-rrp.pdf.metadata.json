An initial environmental examination was \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary initial environmental examination was \ncirculated to the Board in February 2006. \n   \nProject Description  The Project covers the municipalities of Wuhan and Bayannur  in \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) and consists of the \nfollowing: (i) improvement of central heating supply in Dengkou, \nHangjinhouqi,  Linhe,  Wuhai,  Wulatehouqi,  Wulateqianqi, \nWulatezhongqi,  and  Wuyuan;  (ii)  gas  transmission/distribution \nimprovement in these eight areas; (iii) wastewater treatment in \nWulatehouqi and Wulateqianqi; and (iv) institutional reforms and \ncorporate  governance  improvement  for  all  project  implementing \nagencies  (PIAs).  Policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  during \nproject processing focused on (i) maximizing benefits to the poor \nand ensuring that the poor have sufficient heating by establishing \nspecific gas and heating assistance programs, (ii) implementing \nmarket-based tariff reforms and improving billing collection, and \n(iii) promoting private sector participation. \n   \nRationale  Recent rapid economic growth has led to worsening trends of \nenvironmental pollution and ecosystem degradation, particularly \nair and water quality in all major areas (including the eight project \nareas).  The  improved  economic  performance  will  not  be \nsustainable if the government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion (GIMAR) does not immediately respond to the worsening \ntrend of air and water pollution. Urban environmental improvement \nrequires a comprehensive approach including addressing air and \nwater  pollution,  providing  clean  and  cheaper  fuel,  promoting \nprivate  sector  participation  and  institutional  strengthening  to \nimprove operational efficiency of public utilities, and encouraging \nenergy conservation. GIMAR\u2019s willingness to improve the urban \nenvironment  will  provide  a  supportive  environment  for \nimplementing an environmental improvement project in IMAR.  \n   \n   ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will improve the environment by reducing atmospheric \nand water pollution in IMAR. This will be achieved by establishing \nan  efficient,  safe,  and  reliable  gas  and  heating  supply  and \nwastewater treatment facilities to protect water resources, which \nwill conserve energy and water resources in the project areas. \n \nThe Project will have four outputs or components. Component \nA will improve the central heating systems in the project areas \nby installing efficient and large boilers to facilitate the closure of \n396 existing small coal-fired boilers. Component B will provide gas \ntransmission and distribution systems in these areas to supply \nclean and cheaper gas to replace liquefied petroleum gas and \ncoal consumption. Component C will protect water resources by \nenhancing wastewater treatment capacity through construction of \nwastewater  treatment  plants  and  a  sewage  network  in \nWulateqianqi  and  Wulatehouqi.  Component  D  comprises \n(i) institutional  strengthening  and  training  for  implementing  the \ninstitutional and financial reform action plans, (ii) assistance to the \nPIAs  to  implement  tariff  and  regulatory  reforms,  and \n(iii) development of options for private sector participation. Overall, \nthe Project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \noperational strategy in the PRC \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $330.4 million \nequivalent including contingencies  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $120.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility to cover 36% of the project cost including \ninterest and commitment charge during construction on the ADB \nloan. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of \n5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \ndraft Loan and Project Agreements. The balance of the project \ncost will be financed by equity of $175.4 million (53%) from the \nPIAs and domestic loans of $35.0 million (11%).  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Borrower to \nTerms  GIMAR through a subsidiary loan agreement. These proceeds will \nin  turn  be  onlent,  in  succession,  to  the  municipalities  and/or \ncounties and PIAs. All subsidiary and onlending agreements will \nbe made on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2011 \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  30 June 2011 \n   \nExecuting Agency  Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region \n   ", "  iii\nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 4.5 years. GIMAR will be the \nArrangements  Executing Agency. The subcomponents will be implemented by \neight PIAs. A project management office will be responsible for \nmanaging,  coordinating,  and  supervising  implementation  of \nproject  subcomponents.  Each  PIA  will  establish  a  project \nimplementation office to undertake direct responsibility for design, \nconstruction, and operation of subprojects. Project implementation \nstarted in August 2006 with the preparation of bidding documents. \n   \nProcurement  Equipment, materials, and services financed from the proceeds of \nthe  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Items financed with local currency funds \nby GIMAR  will be procured following local competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Advance procurement action and \nretroactive financing was requested by GIMAR and approved by \nADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  Twelve  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n85 person-months of national consulting services will be provided \nto  assist  GIMAR  with  project  implementation,  including  project \nmanagement,  procurement,  construction  supervision  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  impacts.  An  additional \n8 person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n38 person-months of national consulting services will be provided \nfor  implementing  institutional  reforms  and  facilitating \nimplementation of heating tariff reforms. All consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  By addressing air and water pollution, the Project will indirectly \nBeneficiaries  benefit the entire urban population of about 2.2 million residing in \nthe eight project areas.  An estimated 71,324 or 7.5% of the total \nurban  beneficiaries  are  poor  as  measured  by  the  various  city \npoverty lines. The increased use of gas and better central heating \nsupplies will reduce the use of conventional fuels such as raw \ncoal, wood, and coal briquettes to mitigate adverse environmental \nand  health  impacts,  particularly  on  the  poor.  Approximately \n0.96 million urban residents will benefit from the natural gas and \ncentral heating supply with the Project. The wastewater treatment \nprograms  in  Wulateqianqi  and  Wulatehouqi  will  reduce \nwastewater pollution and improve the living conditions and social \neconomic environment in the two counties.  \n \n   \n ", "iv   \n  The  Project  will  improve  energy  efficiency  of  gas  and  heating \nsupply  by  22%  and  conserve  energy  annually  equivalent  to \n540,000  tons  (t)  of  standard  coal.  The  Project  will  provide \nsubstantial environmental and health benefits, including annual \nemission reduction of total suspended particulates, sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen  oxides,  and  greenhouse  gas  of  carbon  dioxide.  The \nwastewater treatment component will lead to annual discharge \nreduction of chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, \nsuspended  solids,  ammonia  nitrogen,  total  nitrogen,  and  total \nphosphorus.  The  quantifiable  local  and  global  environmental \nbenefits over the project life are expected to be about CNY52.2 \nmillion and CNY43 million, respectively, in net present value at \n2004  prices.  Unquantifiable  environmental  benefits,  such  as \nreduced damage from the wastewater of small boilers and gas \nleaks, are also expected to be significant. \n   \n  The economic and financial internal rates of return for the whole \nProject  are  satisfactory  at  21.4%  (with  local  environmental \nbenefits)  and  7.7%,  respectively.  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact \nratio  is  estimated  at  13.5%,  higher  than  the  ratio  of  poverty \npopulation to total population in the project areas (7.5%). The \nProject will create about 10,240 person-years of job opportunities \nduring  construction  and  1,412  full-time  jobs  during  project \noperation. Of the total, 4,090 person-years of job opportunities will \nbe filled by the poor, women, and minorities with an estimated \ntotal of CNY44.2 million in wage payments during construction. In \naddition, 565 employment opportunities with CNY6.1 million of \nannual wage payments are expected to go to the poor, women, \nand minorities during project operation. A total of 52,337 poor \nhouseholds will benefit from a discount on gas and heating supply \nconnection fees (22,971 poor households) and gas and heating \nbills  (29,366  poor  households),  resulting  in  estimated  annual \nsavings  of  CNY10.2  million  in  connection  fees  and \nCNY26.84 million in discounts on gas and heating bills. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The risk of insufficient gas and heating demand for the Project is \nminimal as the gas and central heating supply under the Project is \nmainly  to  meet  existing  demand  and  a  small  fraction  of \nincremental demand. Macroeconomic conditions are expected to \ncontinue to be sound with continuing political stability in the PRC \nand strong economic performance in IMAR. GIMAR will issue and \nenforce  stricter  air  and  water  quality  standards.  The  gas  and \ncentral  heating  supply,  and  wastewater  treatment  under  the \nProject  are  based  on  proven  designs  and  conventional \ntechnologies that have been successfully used in the PRC; no ", "  v\n  significant technical risks are anticipated. The risk of the delay in \nloan effectiveness and construction due to late internal approval \nand procurement are addressed by early preparation of all related \nreports,  timely  submission  of  relevant  documents,  and \nprocurement training for all PIAs. The PIAs will be subject to good \ngovernance  supervision  under  the  project  performance \nmanagement system. ADB\u2019s close involvement will ensure that \ncompetent consultants will be recruited on time. To fully assess \nthe  potential  project  risks,  a  probabilistic  risk  analysis  was \nperformed using the Monte Carlo simulation technique based on \n3,000 simulations for the economic and financial internal rates of \nreturn and the poverty impact ratio. The risk analysis concludes \nthat the Project is robust under future uncertainties, that the risks \nassociated  with  it  are  minimal  and  acceptable,  and  that  the \nprobability of negative outcomes for the poor is also minimal.  \n   \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region \nEnvironment Improvement Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The PRC has severe environmental problems associated with rapid economic growth, \nheavy reliance on coal as the primary fuel, and use of obsolete technology in some industries. \nThe State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) estimates that since the early 1990s \npollution has resulted in a loss to the PRC economy of approximately 4% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), with air pollution accounting for 59%, water pollution 36%, and solid waste 5%.1 \nIn particular, the SEPA estimates that damage from sulfur dioxide (SO ) and acid rain costs the \n2\ncountry CNY110 billion annually. Of the PRC\u2019s 342 major areas, only 132 met the national class \nII air quality standard in 2004. By 2005, only 30% of the rivers met their designated water quality \nstandards, or about half the Government\u2019s target in the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). In \nseven  major  river  basins, 52%  of  river  courses  do  not  meet  the  class  III  standard.  The \n \nGovernment\u2019s efforts in environmental improvement have resulted in a steady decline of major \nair emissions since the mid-1990s. However, during 2002\u20132004, PRC energy consumption \nincreased by 40%, with the consumption of coal, oil, natural gas, and hydropower increasing by \n45%, 33%, 37%, and 30%, respectively. Since 2002, emissions have resumed the upward \ntrend. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) is one of the PRC provinces with severe air \npollution problems in areas due to its heavy reliance on coal as the primary fuel for industry and \nresidential consumption. In 2004, only 7 of 21 areas in IMAR met the national air quality \nstandards. A sector and subsector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  In 2004, 90% of SO and 85% of carbon dioxide (CO ) emitted into the air in the PRC \n2  2\nresulted from burning coal. The PRC is now the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. \nProduction  of  raw  coal  nearly  doubled  in  4  years,  from  1,000  million  tons  (t)  in  2000  to \n1,956 million t in 2004\u2014about 35% of global production in 2004. Coal accounted for 67.7% of \nthe nation\u2019s total energy consumption in 2004 and will continue to be the primary energy \nresource for the foreseeable future. In 2003 and 2004, the PRC\u2019s GDP grew at 9.5%, but \nprimary energy consumption grew at 15.3%. To meet the increasing energy demand, coal \nproduction increased by 20.8% in 2003 and 17.3% in 2004. Natural gas production increased \nfrom 27.2 billion cubic meters (m3) in 2000 to 41.5 billion m3 in 2004, representing a 52.5% \nincrease. In IMAR, coal production was 203.3 million t in 2004 with over 78 active coal mines \nwith capacity greater than 30,000 t per year. State-owned coal mines account for 80% of coal \nproduction capacity. In 2004, the per capita reserves of coal, oil, and natural gas in the PRC \nwere 56%, 11%, and 0.4%, respectively, of the world\u2019s average. \n \n4.  Urban gas and heating demands have grown rapidly due to rising incomes, privatization \nof residential housing, and housing sector growth. As incomes increase, people living in the cold \nnorthern provinces have demanded more and better heating. Central heating in terms of square \nmeters (m2) recorded an annual growth rate of 16% between 1992 and 2004. Nationwide, \nresidential buildings account for about 70% of the total space heating, with commercial and \npublic buildings accounting for the remaining 30%. Heating demand in IMAR has also grown \nrapidly during the past decade. In the PRC, over 60 million t of coal are burned by 500,000 \n                                                 \n1  Based on a study by the Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy of the State Environmental \nProtection Administration. \n \n ", "2   \nsmall, inefficient, coal-fired heating boilers every year, resulting in the emission of substantial \namounts  of  SO ,  CO ,  nitrogen  oxide  (NO ),  and  total  suspended  particulates  (TSP).  The \n2 2 x\nmajority of urban heating supply in IMAR comes from 5,000 of these small boilers, creating \nsevere air pollution problems in urban areas. \n \n5.  Municipal wastewater is a major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes. \nFor many PRC areas, in the absence of a centralized municipal wastewater treatment plant, \nmixtures of raw municipal wastewater and partially treated industrial wastewater are discharged \ndirectly to the nearest body of water. According to water quality standards, surface water \nsources serving municipal water supply systems are polluted to unacceptable levels. In 2004, \nmunicipal  sources  generated  65%  of  the  country\u2019s  estimated  46  billion  m3  of  wastewater; \nindustrial sources generated 35%.Effective municipal wastewater treatment is still in its early \n \nstages, with only about 40% of municipal wastewater treated. Although about 90% of industrial \nwastewater is treated, much of it meets only low effluent standards before discharge. Similarly, \nabout 44% of wastewater in IMAR was treated in 2004; the rest was discharged untreated, \nmainly into the Yellow River and Wuliangsuhai Lake, affecting downstream water quality. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints \n6.  IMAR has a population of about 24 million, with 26% living in urban areas. As one of the \n12 western provinces, its economic development has been relatively slow. In 2004, the average \nper  capita  GDP  in  IMAR  was  CNY11,305,  slightly  higher  than  the  national  average  of \nCNY10,561. Of IMAR's 101 counties, 31 are national poverty counties and 29 are provincial \npoverty counties. IMAR\u2019s GDP increased 8% annually in real terms between 1990 and 1995, \nand 12% between 1996 and 2004. Recent rapid economic growth has led to the worsening \ntrend of environmental pollution and ecosystem degradation, particularly air and water quality in \nall  major  areas  (including  the  eight  project  areas).  Water  shortage  has  become  a  major \nconstraint of IMAR\u2019s economic development. Recent improved economic performance will not \nbe sustainable if the government of IMAR (GIMAR) does not immediately react to the worsening \ntrend of air and water pollution. \n \n7.  Continued strong economic growth in IMAR, combined with a significant increase in \nurban housing construction, has resulted in gas, heating, and water demand outpacing supply. \nConcerns are growing about ensuring sufficient gas, heating, and water supply for the urban \npoor. The adverse effects of urban poverty are often compounded by environmental pollution \nfrom energy and water sources at the household level. The gas, heating, and water distribution \nsystems are usually badly functioning or absent in the poorer sections of the city. The poor do \nnot have the information, access, or funds for more efficient (less-polluting) equipment and \nfuels. Poorly maintained gas, heating, and water distribution systems increase the exposure of \nthe poor to daily doses of pollutants, as well as to the risk of accidents. Indoor air pollution \nparticularly puts women and children at risk. \n \n8.  In IMAR, SOEs have provided public utilities. They have low efficiency, low profitability \nand liquidity, and partly rely on local government support for their operations. The low efficiency \nof  public  utilities  has  resulted  in  substantial  waste  of  energy  and  water  resources,  and \nenvironmental pollution and ecosystem degradation. The experience in IMAR and elsewhere in \nthe PRC indicates that SOE supply of public utilities is not sustainable. The private sector needs \nto participate in public utilities to set benchmarks and improve efficiency. So far, the private \nsector has only very limited involvement in urban gas, heating, and water supply in IMAR. The \npresent business environment and conditions of public utilities do not provide enough incentives \nto attract private investors because of (i) technical and/or institutional uncertainties involving \n ", "3 \nlocal government control over gas and heating distribution, (ii) poor fee collection because \nheating has traditionally been considered as part of the welfare system, (iii) lower profit margins \ndue to the Government\u2019s policy for public utilities, (iv) difficulties in obtaining long-term loans \ndue to low profitability and discrimination of the private sector by state-owned banks, and \n(v)  lack of clear and transparent tariff setting and approval criteria and procedures. \n \n2.  Strategies of the Government and Asian Development Bank \n9.  One of GIMAR\u2019s main development objectives is to contain the worsening trend of \nenvironmental pollution and ecosystem degradation, and to improve the environment in areas. \nGIMAR\u2019s environmental strategy will focus on strengthening its control of pollutant discharge by \nissuing regulations and water standards, and improving monitoring and enforcement. Air quality \nin areas will be improved by substituting coal with gas where feasible, closing polluting small \nboilers for heating,  and  increasing  the  use of  efficient technologies  and  management  that \nminimize urban pollution. Wastewater treatment will be another area of GIMAR\u2019s development \nfocus to provide clean water to its residents and alleviate water shortage. \n \n10.  The operational strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the PRC aims to help \nthe country achieve economic growth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s \nenergy  sector  strategy  includes  (i) developing  cleaner  energy  sources,  (ii) renovating  and \nretrofitting existing facilities to improve efficiency and reduce emissions, (iii) promoting the \ncorporatization and commercialization of energy utilities, and (iv) supporting tariff reforms. \nThis is complemented by ADB's strategy for the environment sector, which supports the use of \neconomic,  supply-side,  and  other  measures  to  (i) ensure  sustainable  utilization  of  natural \nresources and promotion of market-based pricing, and (ii) encourage cost recovery and better \nenvironmental information disclosure. For wastewater treatment and the protection of water \nresources, ADB is focusing on (i) improving wastewater treatment and water supply services \nthrough investment on physical infrastructure, (ii) promoting improved corporate governance \nand commercial management to enhance the potential for future private sector involvement, \n(iii) improving cost recovery by strengthening tariff systems and structures, and (iv) ensuring \nwater resource conservation and environmental protection by continuing support for legislative \nand regulatory provisions. By working to reduce emissions and protect water resources, the \nProject is consistent with and provides support for GIMAR\u2019s development objectives and ADB\u2019s \nenergy, water, and environmental strategy. \n \n3.  Opportunities \n11.  IMAR has air pollution problems due to heavy reliance on coal as the primary fuel for \nindustry and residential consumption, particularly urban heating supply provided by small and \ninefficient coal-fired heating boilers. In 2004, IMAR generated 0.75 billion m3 of wastewater\u2014\n31% from industrial sources\u2014only 44% of the total was treated. Demand for gas, heating, and \nwater supply for domestic and industrial use in IMAR has been increasing, imposing great \npressure on its limited resources. GIMAR considers that proper treatment of wastewater, and \nadequate gas and heating supply are essential to enhance the living standards and productivity \nof  urban  residents,  protect  energy  and  water  resources,  and  sustain  the  current  level  of \neconomic growth. GIMAR will improve air and water quality in all major areas (including the \neight project areas) to meet the national air and water quality standards by 2010. To achieve \nthis, GIMAR will issue and enforce stricter air and water quality standards. By addressing both \nair and water pollution, the Project will be a major part of this effort. The Project, by improving \nthe efficiency and capacity of gas and heating supply systems, closing the existing 396 small \nheating boilers in the project area, providing wastewater treatment facilities to collect and treat \nmore than 80% of urban wastewater in two project areas, and implementing tariff reforms to \n ", "4   \nencourage demand-side management, will help reduce air and water pollution in IMAR and \nconserve energy. \n \n12.  The affordability of the poor for gas, heating, and water services is a major concern in \nIMAR. For example, the average heating bill for a poor household living in a 40 m2 apartment \nunit in IMAR is about CNY160/month during the 5-month heating season. In a typical poor \nhousehold of four, the income at the poverty line is CNY520/household/month in Linhe, CNY600 \nin Wuhai, and CNY912 in Wulateqianqi. Thus, the heating bill represents a large portion of a \npoor  household\u2019s  monthly  income  (30.7%  in  Linhe,  26.7%  in  Wuhai,  and  17.5%  in \nWulateqianqi). This creates a serious affordability problem for poor households with income at \nor below the city poverty lines. In the project area where the temperature in the winter can go as \nlow as minus 250 Celsius, insufficient heating supply will severely affect the quality of life and \nhealth of the poor. GIMAR is willing to make efforts to provide a certain level of urban living \nstandards to address the growing concern of urban poverty, including improving infrastructure of \npublic utilities and establishing social assistance programs. Cost savings resulting from the \nefficiency improvements of the Project will be passed on to the poor in the form of lower gas, \nheating, and water bills, and connection fee discounts. Other assistance programs will be \ndesigned to alleviate affordability problems. \n \n13.  Although private sector participation is a new phenomenon in public utilities in IMAR, it \nhas demonstrated positive impacts in terms of better management and operational efficiency. \nBetween now and 2020, IMAR will need substantial capital investments to meet rising gas, \nheating, and water demand. The resources of local governments and those provided by the \ncentral  Government  can  only  meet  20%  to  25%  of  the  investment  requirement.  GIMAR \nrecognizes the importance of private sector participation in sustaining supply of public utilities \nand is willing to support private sector involvement by providing a guarantee for lower cost \nfunding and by carrying out necessary reforms. With GIMAR support, the Project, by selecting \nBayannur Municipality as a pilot, will directly support private sector participation by providing \nbetter project facilities, and removing barriers and creating an enabling environment through \npolicy  dialogue  in  tariff  reform  and  institutional  strengthening.  The  Project\u2019s  institutional \nstrengthening  will  address  the  issues  of  implementing  capacity,  full-cost  recovery,  and \nimprovement of corporate governance. \n \n14.  The  urban  environmental  improvement  requires  a  comprehensive  approach  and \nGIMAR\u2019s willingness to make efforts to improve the urban environment will provide a supportive \nenvironment for implementing an environmental improvement project in IMAR. The project \ndesign  takes  into  consideration  problem  and  constraints  analysis,  lessons  learned,  and \nassessment of alternative approaches. The focus of policy dialogue was based on the findings \nof  ADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the  Government,  beneficiary  consultations, \ndiscussions with other funding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility reports and \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) consultants. \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n15.  ADB\u2019s experience in the PRC\u2019s energy sector has shown that projects are generally well \nplanned and implemented smoothly. The overall implementation performance of ADB\u2019s energy \nportfolio is satisfactory. Compliance with covenants is generally acceptable, although greater \nefforts are required to implement policy-related covenants. Rigorous government screening of \nprojects  has  had  a  positive  impact.  The  project  completion  and  project  performance  audit \nreports for energy projects indicate that overall they were implemented smoothly, and assess \nthem all as generally successful. Recently, some ongoing energy projects in the PRC have \nexperienced implementation delays relating to long internal approval processes, procurement \nissues, and large cost savings. \n ", "5 \n \n16.  The project completion reports prepared for three ADB environment projects and the \nproject performance evaluation reports for one of the environment projects revealed that the \nactual  achievements  of  some  heating  supply  components  were  lower  than  estimated  at \nappraisal. This was due to several factors, such as lower demand for heating, insufficient heat \nsource, unsuitable design for switching from coal to natural gas, and lower heat and power \ntariffs than anticipated at appraisal. Some projected industrial establishments either did not \nmaterialize  or  lacked  the  financial  capacity  to  pay  for  heating  services.  Some  heating \ncomponents  were  canceled  when  no  noticeable  progress  was  made  and  after  the \nimplementation agencies realized that the projected market for steam and heat usage was \noverly optimistic. In addition, the design to switch these heating companies\u2019 fuel source from \ncoal to natural gas would have seriously affected their financial viability and required large \ngovernment  subsidies. The  lower  heat  and  power  tariffs  coupled  with  lower  achievements \nprevented the project entities from achieving good financial performance. Lessons learned from \nADB\u2019s  post-evaluation  experience  in  wastewater  treatment  indicate  that  both  supply  and \ndemand-side concerns must be integrated into project design. Encouraging broad reforms such \nas commercial management and introducing competition will promote efficient and responsive \ndelivery of water supply and wastewater services. The Project will ensure the viability and \nsustainability of gas, heating, and water supply by incorporating these lessons in project design, \npreparation, risk assessment, and implementation. Appendix 3 presents a summary of external \nassistance and lessons learned.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The Project will improve the environment by reducing atmospheric and water pollution in \nIMAR. This will be achieved by establishing an efficient, safe, and reliable gas and heating \nsupply to facilitate the closure of small coal-fired boilers, and wastewater treatment facilities to \nprotect water resources, which will conserve energy and water resources in the project areas. \n \nB.  Outputs \n18.  The Project has four components: urban central heating supply; natural gas transmission \nand distribution; urban wastewater treatment; and institutional reform and corporate governance \nimprovement.  The  feasibility  studies  and  engineering  design  for  the  subcomponents  were \nprepared  by  several  design  and  engineering  institutes  in  the  PRC  with  experience  and \nqualifications acceptable to ADB. The project preparatory TA consultants reviewed the feasibility \nstudy reports and other supplementary documents. They noted that their previous comments \nwere reflected in the project design and were satisfied with the quality of the feasibility studies \nand engineering design. \n \n19.  Component  A:  Urban  Central  Heating  Supply.  Component  A  comprises  eight \nsubcomponents and will involve the installation of 21 large efficient coal-fired boilers, 138 heat \nexchange stations, and 87.6 kilometers (km) of heat supply pipelines to facilitate closure of \n396 small inefficient coal-fired boilers. The subcomponents are listed in Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6   \nTable 1: Subcomponents under Component A \nCity  New Boilers  Heat Exchange  Heat Supply  Old Boilers \nStations  Pipelines  Closure \n    No.  (MW)  No.  km  No. \nA.1  Dengkou  3a  29x3  11  3.0  39 \nA.2  Hangjinhouqi  3  58x3  31  10.6  11 \nA.3  Linhe      31  36.2  58 \nA.4  Wuhai  4  64x2+29x2  22  10.7  112 \nA.5  Wulatehouqi  2  29x2  14  9.0  35 \nA.6  Wulateqianqi  3  29x3  9  9.8  64 \nA.7  Wulatezhongqi  2  29x2  8  3.0  20 \nA.8  Wuyuan  4a  29x4  12  5.3  57 \n  Total  21  766  138  87.6  396 \nNo. = number; MW = megawatt; km = kilometer. \na  Circulating fluidized bed (CFB)-type boilers. \nSource: Project Management Office. \n \n20.  Component B: Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution. Component B comprises \ntwo  subcomponents:  (i)  the  Changqing\u2013Wuhai\u2013Linhe  natural  gas  transmission  pipeline \nsubcomponent  will  construct  a  401  km  pipeline  across  the  region  of  Erdos,  Wuhai,  and \nBayannur; and (ii) the natural gas distribution subcomponent will construct (a) natural gas \ndistribution networks in eight areas (same as component A), and (b) one master compressed \nnatural gas station in Linhe to supply compressed natural gas. \n \n21.  Component C: City Wastewater Treatment. Component C has two subcomponents: \n(i) the  Wulatehouqi  wastewater  treatment  plant  and  sewage  network  subcomponent  will \nconstruct (a) a 6,000 t/day wastewater treatment plant, and (b) 13.2 km sewage piping network; \nand (ii) the Wulateqianqi wastewater treatment plant and sewage network subcomponent will \nconstruct (a) a 80,000 t/day wastewater plant to treat the city\u2019s wastewater and industrial \nwastewater, and (b) a 40.0 km sewage piping network and five pumping stations.  \n \n22.  Component  D:  Institutional  Reform  and  Corporate  Governance  Improvement. \nInstitutional  capacity  and  corporate  governance  aspects  were  assessed  by  the  project \npreparatory  TA  consultants  for  each  project  implementing  agency  (PIA).  Based  on  the \nassessment, the TA consultants developed an institutional reform action plan for each PIA, and \na financial reform action plan to address cost reduction, bill collection, and financial capacity of \nthe PIAs. Both institutional and financial action plans were discussed with and supported by the \nPIAs. To strengthen the PIAs\u2019 institutional and financial management capacity, component D \ncomprises  (i) institutional  strengthening  and  training  for  implementing  the  institutional  and \nfinancial reform action plans, (ii) assistance to the PIAs to implement the tariff and regulatory \nreforms, and (iii) development of options for private sector participation. The institutional reform \nwill require separation of government functions from commercial management of the PIAs, and \ntransforming  the  noncorporate  PIAs  into  new  corporate  structures  according  to  the  PRC\u2019s \nCompany Law. The financial reforms will assist all the PIAs to build capacity in cost reduction, \nbill  collection,  efficient  accounting,  and  commercial  management.  The  consultants  under \ncomponent D will also help the PIAs prepare tariff reform action plans in accordance with \nrecommendations made by ADB\u2019s TA2 for Pro-Poor Urban Heating Tariff Reforms.3 The TA \nformulated  national  pro-poor  heating  tariff  guidelines  and  established  the  principles  of  an \neffective heating tariff collection mechanism. The consultants under component D will also study \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Pro-Poor Urban Heating Tariff Reforms. \nManila. \n3  The Ministry of Construction was the executing agency for the TA. The TA\u2019s objective was to help the Government \nreform the urban heating sector and promote sustainable urban heating supply in the PRC by (i) formulating pro-\npoor national heating tariff guidelines, and (ii) establishing an effective heating tariff collection mechanism. The TA \nwas completed in 2005. \n ", "7 \noptions for private sector participation in the PIAs. The options developed and implemented will \ndemonstrate how public utilities can be privatized without lowering the quality of utility supply. \nThe Project will provide additional opportunities for ADB to address policy concerns and help \ncreate a supportive environment for private sector participation. \n \nC.  Special Features \n23.  Energy Efficiency Improvement and Energy Conservation. Energy conservation and \nefficient use of energy are of high priority in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). ADB is \nactively supporting the PRC in both these areas. The Project will build large and efficient (above \n80% combustion efficiency) heat boilers equipped with modern pollution control devices to \nfacilitate the closure of 396 small coal-fired boilers. These existing small coal-fired boilers have \nlow thermal efficiency in the range of 55% to 65%, and do not have adequate pollution control \ndevices. In addition, the natural gas pipelines and urban gas distribution networks under the \nProject will provide cleaner fuel that has 25% higher efficiency than coal. Overall, the Project\u2019s \ngas and central heating supply components are expected to improve energy efficiency by 22%. \nThe improvement will annually conserve energy equivalent to 340,000 t of standard coal from \nthe central heating supply and 200,000 t from the gas supply. \n \n24.  Urban  Heating  Tariff  Reforms. Heating tariff reforms are required to improve and \nsustain urban heating supply in IMAR. The current average heating tariff of about CNY15/m2 for \nthe heating season in IMAR is still lower than that of other provinces, but reflects supply cost in \nthe project areas.4 Tariff reforms need to focus on the tariff structure and bill collection. At \npresent, all of the urban heating tariffs are based on a simple fixed rate per square meter \n(e.g., CNY/m2) of the living area or floor area of buildings. Problems with the current heating \ntariff  structure,  payment,  and  collection  systems  include  (i) the  tariff  structure  does  not \nencourage efficient use of heat; (ii) the enterprise-based tariff payment system is not market-\noriented and causes difficulty in tariff collection and (iii)  transparent criteria and methodologies \nfor tariff setting and adjustment are lacking. In addition, the layout of the piping system in \nexisting buildings makes disconnecting supply to delinquent customers difficult for the heating \ncompany. All new buildings in IMAR are required to follow new building codes and use energy-\nefficient building materials. Traditionally in IMAR, heating bills were paid by employers for their \nemployees. In the mid-1990s, many SOEs became financially unviable and could not pay the \nheating bills for their employees. This caused tariff collection to drop to 50%, creating severe \nfinancial difficulties for the heating companies. Tariff collection improved to 70% in 2004 in the \nproject areas and a further improvement to 95% is expected with the Project. To address these \nissues,  GIMAR  will  implement  the  agreed  heating  tariff  reforms  in  the  project  areas.  The \nconsultants under component D will help develop specific reform action plans for (i) installing \nradiator control valves in apartment units to encourage heat conservation, (ii) implementing a \ntwo-part heating tariff so that the variable charge will be based on actual heat consumption, \n(iii) installing heat-measuring devices in apartment units to support consumption-based billing \nsystems, and (iv) training heating company staff on implementation of reform measures. After \nthe reforms, consumers will have the ability to regulate the amount of heat that they consume, \nwhich is essential if tariff-based incentives for heat conservation, insulation installation, and heat \nloss reduction are to work. \n \n25.  Private Sector Participation. With the combined efforts of GIMAR and the ADB project \nteam, the Project will establish private sector participation in central heating and wastewater \ntreatment subsectors in IMAR. Bayannur municipality was selected as the pilot area to involve \nthe  private  sector  in  public  utilities.  The  Project  will  directly  support  five  privately  owned \n                                                 \n4  The heating tariff of CNY15/m2 in IMAR is lower than about CNY19.5/m2 in Xinjiang, CNY20/m2 in Heilongjiang, \nand CNY24/m2 in Beijing. \n ", "8   \ncompanies in central heating supply and wastewater treatment to upgrade and expand heating \nsupply services and provide wastewater treatment facilities. Through policy dialogue and other \nreform measures, an enabling environment for private sector participation will be created by \nreducing institutional uncertainties, improving fee collection, and promoting transparent tariff \nsetting. The five private heating companies involved expect to benefit from the Project in the \nareas of technology upgrade, institutional strengthening, and heating tariff reforms. For the local \ngovernments, the efficiency gains of the heating supply companies with the Project will be used \nto reduce the financial burden in subsidizing the poor and proper treatment of wastewater that \nwas discharged untreated into the Yellow River. Further, a better managed heating subsector \nwill reduce the efforts of local governments to ensure that their urban residents have sufficient \nheating. The Project will demonstrate that private sector participation in public utilities can be \nbeneficial to all parties, and will catalyze private sector involvement in the heating and water \nsubsectors in IMAR. The consultants under component D will identify options for future private \nsector participation in the rest of the project implementing companies. \n \n26.  Benefits for the Poor. In the project areas, heating bills currently account for 17.5% to \n30.7% of the average monthly incomes of poor households. Although improving facilities and \nsupply efficiency will preclude tariff increases, measures need to be taken to make gas and \nheating more affordable to the poor. GIMAR agreed to include two specific programs. The first \nwill require the PIAs to provide gas and heating connection, and tariff discounts to the poor, \nbased on the benefits of the cost savings arising from the 22% efficiency improvement and \nincreasing bill collection to 95%. Each PIA has committed to share the benefits and extend the \ndiscount  to  the  poor  after  satisfying  the  loan  conditions.  They  estimate  that  52,337  poor \nhouseholds will benefit: 22,971 from the discount on gas and heating supply connection fees, \nand 29,366 from the discount on gas and heating bills. This will result in an annual benefit of \nCNY10.2 million in connection fees, and CNY26.8 million in discounts on gas and heating bills; \nrepresenting about 1.8% of the total revenue of the gas and heating companies after the Project \nis completed. The second program requires the county governments to establish a heating \nassistance fund for the poor. It will be included in the annual county budget and the funding \nlevel will not be dependent on budget availability. The county government subsidies through the \nheating assistance fund will be designed so that average heating expenses do not exceed 5% \nof a poor household\u2019s monthly expenditure.  \n \n27.  The  experience  from  the  ongoing  TA,  Heating  Supply  for  Urban  Poor  in  Liaoning \nProvince,5 will  also  help  GIMAR  implement  pro-poor  national  heating  tariff  guidelines  and \nimprove tariff collection; design heating assistance programs for the poor; and develop an \neffective provincial and local monitoring, supervision, and evaluation systems. To make heating \naffordable, about CNY13.4 million will be provided through the heating assistance fund. If the \nfirst program from the PIAs has a shortfall due to a delay in realizing project benefits, the city \ngovernments will increase the contribution to cover the gap. These assistance programs are \nconsistent with ADB policy that tariff subsidies to the poor be transparent and explicit, and \nfunded  by  the  government  budget;  separating  the  welfare  objective  from  the  commercial \nmanagement of public utilities. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n28.  The project investment cost is estimated at $330.4 million equivalent, including physical \nand price contingencies, and financial charges during development (Table 2 and Appendix 4). \nThe foreign exchange costs are $135.3 million, or about 41%. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2004.

Financing Plan \n29.  The Government has requested a loan of $120.0 million (36.3% of the total project cost) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. These finance charges during construction will be financed from ADB loan. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The balance of the project cost will be financed by the PIAs \nthrough equity of $175.44 million (53.1%) and domestic loans of $34.97 million (10.6%). The \nloan from local banks will have a repayment period of 5 to 10 years, including a grace period of \n1 to 2 years, and an interest rate of 6.5%. The Borrower will be the PRC, which will make the \nproceeds of the loan available to GIMAR on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB \nloan. These proceeds will in turn be onlent, in succession and on the same terms and conditions \nas the ADB loan, to the municipalities of Bayannur and Wuhai; the counties of Linhe, Dengkou, \nHangjinhouqi, Wuyuan, Wulatehouqi, Wulateqianqi , and Wulatezhongqi; and to the PIAs. The \nPIAs will assume the foreign exchange and interest variation risks of the loan. The Borrower \nand GIMAR have assured that counterpart funding will be provided to meet the requirements of \nthe Project.

Implementation Arrangements \n30.  Project  Management.  GIMAR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  The \nsubcomponents will be implemented by various PIAs. A project management office (PMO) will \nbe  responsible  for  managing,  coordinating,  and  supervising  implementation  of  all  project \nsubcomponents.  Each  PIA  will  establish  a  project  implementation  office  to  be  directly \nresponsible for design, construction, and operation of subprojects. Based on an assessment of \nGIMAR\u2019s management expertise and its extensive experience in World Bank and other bilateral \nprojects,  GIMAR  shows  the  capability  to  implement  this  Project  and  demonstrates  strong \ncommitment for the Project.  \n \n31.  Implementation Period. Construction of the project facilities is expected to take place \nover 4.5 years beginning in August 2006, and project components to be completed by 30 June \n2011.  Site  preparation  for  some  heating  facilities  has  been  completed;  the  routing  of  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  pipelines  and  the  location  of  the  related  facilities  has  been \nfinalized. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n32.  Procurement. All goods and works under the Project to be wholly or partly financed by \nADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines.  Based  on  the \nimplementation  schedule,  a  procurement  plan  was  prepared.  Civil  works  contracts  costing \n$10 million or more and each supply contract costing $1 million or more financed by ADB will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  using  ADB\u2019s  standard \nbidding documents. Other supply contract packages costing less than $1 million will be procured \neither using national competitive bidding (NCB), or in exceptional circumstances with the prior \napproval  of  ADB,  limited  international  bidding  (LIB)  procedures.  Supply  contract  packages \ncosting less than $100,000 will be procured using shopping procedures. Civil works contracts \ncosting less than $10 million will be procured through NCB. All locally financed items will be \nprocured using procedures acceptable to ADB.  Project design, construction supervision, quality \ncontrol, and contract management will be performed in accordance with national standards \nacceptable to ADB and internationally accepted practices.  Bidding documents will require \ndisclosure of the risks of sexually transmitted diseases in health and safety programs. Equal job \nopportunities will be accorded to men and women. The procurement plan listing the packages \nand their modes of procurement is in Appendix 6.  \n \n ", "11 \n33.  Consulting Services. International and national consultants financed under the loan will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality \nand cost-based selection method with simplified technical proposal. For project implementation \nsupervision,  about  12 person-months  of  international  and  76  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services6  will be engaged to assist GIMAR and the PIAs with (i) project design and \nengineering, (ii) procurement, (iii) construction supervision related to equipment and materials \nprocured under ADB financing, (iv) project management, (v) impact monitoring and assistance to \nprepare all required reports to ADB and GIMAR.  International and national consultants will also \nbe  recruited  for  the  institutional  reform  and  the  corporate  governance  improvement \nsubcomponent,  which  includes  institutional  and  tariff  reforms,  and  corporate  governance \nimprovement and related training. About 9 person-months of international consulting services \nand  53 person-months  of  national  consulting  services  are  expected  to  be  required.  Some \nnational consultants will be engaged by the PMO and the project implementation offices for site \nsupervision and various tasks relating to project implementation. They will have qualifications \nand experience acceptable to ADB. GIMAR was informed of the selection procedures of the \nquality and cost-based selection method. \n \n34.  Disbursement Arrangements. The loan proceeds will be withdrawn in accordance with \nADB's  standard  disbursement  procedures.  To  facilitate  disbursement  of  numerous  small \nexpenditures, GIMAR will set up an imprest account after loan effectiveness in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). Disbursements from the imprest account \nwill  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  applications  and  related  documentation.  Such \ndocumentation  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things,  that  the  goods  and/or  services  are \nproduced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  members,  and  eligible  for  ADB  financing.  The  initial \namount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  6  months  of  estimated \nexpenditures, or $5.0 million, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures procedure may \nbe used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures. Individual payments to be reimbursed or \nliquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000. \n \n35.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing. In January 2006, the PMO \nstarted recruitment of the implementation consultants and procurement agents to prepare bid \ndocuments. In view of the advanced stage of project preparation, ADB management approved \nGIMAR\u2019s request for advance procurement action, which includes recruitment of consultants \nand procurement of goods and civil works, and the request for retroactive financing of eligible \nexpenditures up to $12.0 million (equivalent to 10% of the ADB loan) incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness but not earlier than 1 June 2006, or a maximum of 12 months prior to the date of \nthe loan agreement, whichever is later. The Government was advised that ADB approval of \nadvance procurement action7 and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to \napprove the proposed loan. Contracts proposed for retroactive financing will be undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n36.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting \nsystems and procedures for the Project will be in accordance with the Guidelines for the \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. Each PIA will \nmaintain separate accounts of their operations and of the Project, and submit through the PMO \nto ADB audited project accounts and agency financial statements in English not later than \n6 months after the end of the financial year. The Government, GIMAR, and the PIAs have been \ninformed  about  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  financial  statements  and  possible \npenalties for delays in submission. The submitted audited project accounts and agency financial \nstatements should be of acceptable quality and be prepared in accordance with internationally \n                                                 \n6  About 20 person-months of national consulting services under the implementation supervision will be provided to \ndevelop benchmarks and indicators for the economic, social, and environmental impact of the Project. \n7  The advance action was published in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 March 2006. \n ", "12   \naccepted accounting standards. Financial statements with adverse opinions or disclaimers from \nauditors are considered unacceptable and cannot be submitted for this purpose. GIMAR and the \nPIAs, through the PMO, will also submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of \nthe loan proceeds, project implementation, and the performance of each PIA. The reports will \ninclude (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation, and (ii) a project completion \nreport not later than 3 months after completion of the project facilities. The PIAs will engage \nauditing firms with experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB to carry out the annual \naudits. \n \n37.  Anticorruption Measures. ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy8 was explained to and discussed \nwith the PRC Government and GIMAR. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of GIMAR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to the  Project.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and  contracts  during  bidding  and \nimplementation of the Project. Items financed by the PIAs with local currency funds will be \nprocured following bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. For the Project, GIMAR will take the \nfollowing anticorruption actions: (i) involve full-time officials from the Finance Bureau of IMAR in \nthe supervision of bidding, construction, and operations; and (ii) carry out periodic inspections of \nthe contractors\u2019 activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n38.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. A project performance management \nsystem (PPMS) was developed by the project preparatory TA consultants and agreed to by \nGIMAR. The PPMS includes a set of measurable indicators based on the project design, \nimpacts, and risks. The macroeconomic and sector performance, institutional capacity, and \nreforms were taken into account in designing the monitoring indicators. The indicators cover \nenvironmental impacts, and social and poverty impacts. The major indicators are presented in \nthe design and monitoring framework. In addition, a feedback and reporting mechanism for \neffective project implementation and initial startup activities, including a baseline survey based \non a random household sample to be monitored with follow-up surveys, was included in the \nPPMS.  Each  PIA  will  establish  an  environmental  and  resettlement  management  unit  to \ncoordinate environmental and resettlement management issues associated with the contract \npackages, and during construction and operation. GIMAR will engage an independent domestic \nagency to monitor implementation of the resettlement plan and prepare evaluation reports. The \nimplementation supervision consultants will include an impact monitoring unit (an independent \ndomestic agency) with 20 person-months of national consulting services to develop benchmarks \nand  indicators  for  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impact  of  the  Project.  During \nimplementation, the implementation consultants and the impact monitoring unit will help GIMAR \nto monitor project impacts, and GIMAR and the PIAs will keep ADB informed of implementation \nprogress  with  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  resettlement  plan  through \nquarterly progress reports. Annual reports on achievement of resettlement, environmental, and \nsocial objectives will be submitted to ADB during project implementation and on completion. A \nlonger term monitoring plan after project completion, including an effective monitoring and \nevaluation system, will be developed by the impact monitoring unit and implemented by GIMAR. \nThe monitoring and evaluation system will include specific and measurable targets, and identify \nkey  risks  and  institutional  arrangements  for  effective  monitoring.  The  implementation \nconsultants will also provide the necessary training on monitoring. \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n ", "13 \n \n39.   Project Midterm Review. Two years after loan effectiveness, ADB, GIMAR, and the \nPIAs will carry out a midterm review of the Project, covering all institutional, administrative, \norganizational,  technical,  environmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  resettlement,  economic, \nfinancial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project \nand its continuing viability. The review will examine progress in sector reforms, and evaluate \ndevelopment and poverty impact, and compliance with assurances in the loan agreement. The \nreview shall also undertake a comprehensive review of potential Loan savings, identify areas for \nreallocation of Loan proceeds, and change disbursement percentages, as appropriate. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n40.  Project  preparation  included  economic,  financial,  environmental,  and  social \nassessments. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n41.  Risks associated with the demand forecasts for the Project are minimal as the Project \nwill provide gas, heating, and wastewater treatment mainly to meet the existing demand and a \nsmall share of incremental demand. The gas distribution component will meet only a small \nshare of the total incremental demand for gas in the project areas. The city central heating \nsupply component will replace small boilers to meet the existing heating demand and a small \nportion of incremental demand. A least-cost analysis was performed for each of the three \ncategories of outputs by the Project, including (i) utilization of natural gas for industrial and \nresidential consumption, (ii) central heating supply, and (iii) wastewater treatment. For specific \nindustries and household cooking and water heating in the project areas, the analysis indicates \nthat natural gas is the least-cost option. The large-size centralized boilers proposed under the \nProject for central heating supplies are the least-cost options. For wastewater treatment plants, \nconsidering the technical infeasibility of small-scale, individually installed wastewater treatment \nequipment, and the nonexistence of sewer systems between project areas and central sewage \ntreatment plants, the analysis concluded that on-site sewage treatment plants provide the least \ncost option. \n \n42.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  each  project \nsubcomponent  and  for  the  whole  Project  (Appendix  7).  As  in  the  least-cost  analysis,  the \neconomic analysis applied the conversion factors to investment cost for land,9 cost of equipment \nfuel, and operation and maintenance costs where applicable. The benefits of output were valued \nbased  on  the  cost  saving  of  alternative  fuels  and  efficiency  improvement.  The  cost-saving \nbenefits were valued as the cost differences of the supply options with and without the Project. \nA survey was carried out to determine the appropriate supply options for each category of \nconsumer. Local environmental benefits were taken into account in the EIRR calculation. Line \nlosses are based on the statistics of historical line-loss rates in each project area. \n \n43.  The economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the Project is based on the \nbenefits transfer method. The evaluation used (i) the methodology adopted in ADB\u2019s Economic \nEvaluation of Environmental Impacts: A Workbook (1996) to determine the adjusted estimate of \nthe monetary damages caused by air pollution during the study period, taking into account the \nlocation of the pollution sources, emission level, and population affected; and (ii) estimates of \naverage annual climate change for carbon emissions to evaluate the monetary damage caused \nby greenhouse gas emissions. The economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the \n                                                 \n9  Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n ", "14   \nwastewater projects is based on the criterion of collecting fees for wastewater in IMAR.10 The \nEIRRs  presented  in  Table  4  include  only  the  local  environmental  benefits.  If  the  global \nenvironmental benefits are added to the project benefits, the EIRR for the whole Project would \nincrease to 22.6%. \n \n44.  The summary results of the EIRR calculation presented in Table 4 reflect all project-\nrelated costs, the benefits from cost savings of alternative fuels and efficiency improvement, and \nlocal environmental benefits. The EIRR calculation is a conservative approach, as it takes into \naccount only the main benefits of different components but includes all project-related costs. \nThis approach yields EIRRs ranging from 10.0% to 25.9% without and 14.0% to 40.0% with the \nlocal environmental benefits for the project subcomponents. For the whole Project, the EIRR will \nbe 17.6% without and 21.4% with the local environmental benefits. Sensitivity analyses were \nperformed for each subcomponent. For the EIRR of the whole Project, sensitivity analyses show \nthe  EIRR  (with  local  environmental  benefits)  would  decrease  to  (i)  17.6%  if  the  Project \nexperiences a cost overrun of 20%; (ii) 12.5% if the benefits are reduced by 20%; (iii) 15.0% if \nthe Project experiences a commissioning delay of 1 year; and (iv) 6.4% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all \nwere to happen. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(%) \n  EIRR without    EIRR with Local \nSubcomponent  Environment Benefits  Environment Benefits \nDengkou Central Heating Supply  22.1    26.4 \nHangjinhouqi Central Heating Supply  12.8    17.9 \nLinhe Central Heating Supply  10.0    14.0 \nWuhai Central Heating Supply  11.0    15.0 \nWulatehouqi Central Heating Supply  16.5    21.8 \nWulateqianqi Central Heating Supply  17.9    23.7 \nWulatezhongqiCentral Heating Supply  14.3    20.1 \nWuyuan Central Heating Supply  15.8    19.3 \nChang-Wu-Lin Gas Transmission  20.4    20.4 \nGas Distribution and Station  15.4    16.8 \nWulatehouqi Wastewater Treatment  25.9    40.0 \nWulateqianqi Wastewater Treatment  12.5    21.2 \nThe Whole Project  17.6    21.4 \n EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n45.  The natural gas component will be implemented by Inner Mongolia Western Natural Gas \nLtd, a limited liability shareholding SOE. The company was formed in 2002 and its first phase of \nthe gas pipeline was completed in 2004. The wastewater subcomponents in Wulateqianqi and \nWulatehouqi will be implemented by Inner  Mongolia Saiwaixing Huazhang Paper Ltd. and \nWulatehouqi Water Company, respectively. The central heating component will be implemented \nby six different PIAs, including Inner Mongolia Saiwaixing Huazhang Paper Ltd. in Wulateqianqi; \nBayannur Fuyan Shiye Group Ltd. in Linhe, Wuyuan, and Dengkou; Wuhai Thermal Company \nin Wuhai City; Wulatezhongqi Dagong Thermal Ltd. in Wulatezhongqi; Wulatehouqi Huibao \nThermal Ltd. in Wulatehouqi; and Inner Mongolia Haosheng Thermal Ltd. in Hangjinhouqi. All \nthe PIAs follow the accounting system prescribed by PRC law and regulations, which is being \naligned with international financial reporting standards. An external auditor acceptable to ADB \nwill be selected during the appraisal to audit the project and company financial statements. \n \n                                                 \n10  This methodology was adopted in ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n ", "15 \n46.  Summaries of the financial statements and projected financial performance of the PIAs \nare in Appendix 8. Differences exist among the PIAs due to corporate structure, size, age, and \ntheir core businesses. Inner Mongolia Saiwaixing Huazhang Paper Ltd., a private company, has \ngood  financial  records.  Two  SOEs,  Wuhai  Thermal  Power  Company,  Wulatehouqi  Water \nCompany, currently have low profitability and liquidity, and partly rely on local government \nsupport  for  their  operations.  These  enterprises  will  have  to  take  measures  to  reduce \nadministrative costs and inefficiencies, and seek opportunities for privatization. Commercial \noperations of the gas pipeline of Inner Mongolia Western Natural Gas Ltd. only started in 2005; \nits  financial  performance  is  expected  to  be  good  based  on  its  financial  projections.  Inner \nMongolia Haosheng Thermal Company Ltd., Wulatehouqi Huibao Thermal Company Ltd., and \nWulatezhongqi Dagong Thermal Company Ltd., are newly formed companies to implement \ncentral heating subcomponents. ADB's investment and institutional strengthening in gas and \ncentral  heating  supply  will  address  concerns  regarding  high  distribution  losses,  closure  of \ninefficient small boilers, and poor bill collection. The PIAs must pay close attention to problems \nrelating to productivity, operational inefficiencies, and improvement in bill collection to ensure \nproject  sustainability.  The  local  governments  have  been  supportive  of  tariff  adjustments \nbecause of concerns for inefficient small boilers that pollute the environment, and for security of \nfuel supply. The PIAs will implement the financial reform action plans developed by the TA \nconsultants with the help of the consultants under component D. Regular ADB review missions \nwill closely monitor financial performance of the PIAs. \n \n47.  The financial viability of the subcomponents will be ensured by revenue enhancement \nand cost reduction measures, including implementation of a two-part heating tariff. The financial \ninternal rates of return (FIRRs) of the subcomponents range from 6.7% to 8.4% (Table 5) and \ncompare favorably with the respective estimated weighted average costs of capital ranging from \n3.3% to 4.0% (Appendix 9). The FIRR (Table A9.2) for the whole Project is estimated at 7.7%, \nwhich also compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital for the entire Project \ncalculated on an after-tax basis at 3.9%. The Project is considered both financially viable and \nsustainable. Sensitivity analysis (Tables A9.1 and A9.3) shows that the FIRR for the whole \nProject would decrease to (i) 6.6% if the Project experiences a capital cost overrun of 10%, \n(ii) 6.7% with a 10% operating cost overrun, (iii) 5.2% if the benefits are reduced by 10%, \n(iv) 7.3% if the Project experiences a commissioning delay of 1 year, and (v) 2.9% if all four \nhappen. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Financial Internal Rates of Return and \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  \n(%) \nSubcomponent  FIRR  WACC \nDengkou Central Heating Supply   6.7  4.0 \nHangjinhouqi Heating Supply  7.3  3.6 \nLinhe Central Heating Supply  7.1  4.0 \nWuhai Central Heating Supply  8.4  4.4 \nWulatehouqi Heating Supply  8.2  4.0 \nWulateqianqi Heating Supply  7.6  4.0 \nWulatezhongqi Heating Supply  7.5  3.5 \nWuyuan Heating Supply  7.6  4.0 \nChang-Wu-Lin Gas Transmission  7.9  3.7 \nGas Distribution and Station  7.9  3.6 \nWulatehouqi Wastewater Treatment  6.7  4.0 \nWulateqianqi Wastewater Treatment  7.3  3.3 \nThe Overall Project  7.7  3.9 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n ", "16   \nC.  Environmental Benefits and Impacts \n48.  The Project is classified as environment category B (sensitive). The methodology and \nresults of quantifying project environmental benefits are presented in Appendix 10. The Project \nhas substantial environmental benefits resulting from energy efficiency improvements, reduction \nin emissions from coal burning, and reduction of pollutant discharge into the Yellow River and \nWuliangsuhai  Lake.  Potential  adverse  impacts  assessed  during  project  preparation  are \ntemporary and localized during construction. According to the EMP, the PIAs will implement \nprudent construction management practices to minimize any construction impacts. The PIAs will \nbe  responsible  for  environmental  management  during  project  operation.  The  ADB  review \nmissions and the project implementation consultants will monitor and ensure implementation of \nthese mitigating measures to minimize impacts during construction. \n \n49.  Provincial and local environmental protection bureaus are expanding public information \nprograms, mainly via websites, newspapers, television, and radio.11 Improved environmental \ndisclosure  is  expected  to  facilitate  environmental  management  measures  included  in  the \nProject. In principle, ADB supports the expanded public information programs, including the \nenvironmental performance rating pilot project tested in Nanjing and other PRC areas during the \npast 3 years. Local environmental protection bureaus in IMAR will expand their public disclosure \nactivities.  GIMAR  will  ensure  that  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  project  facilities  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the \nmitigation measures as identified in the initial environmental examination (IEE) and summary \nIEE.12 The EMP prepared by GIMAR is summarized in the IEE; it covers all phases of project \nimplementation from construction to operation. \n \n50.  The IEE concludes that the Project will provide significant benefits for the environment in \nthe project area. Regional air quality will improve with closure of small coal-fired boilers, more \nefficient gas distribution systems, and reduction in coal use because of more efficient boilers. \nThe environmental benefits from the Project include annual coal savings of 540,000 t, and an \nannual emission reduction of total suspended particulates of 19,136 t, SO  of 15,105 t, NO  of \n2 x\n2,272  t,  and  greenhouse  gas  of  CO   equivalent  of  787,243  t.  The  wastewater  treatment \n2\ncomponent will lead to annual discharge reduction of 14,126 t of chemical oxygen demand, \n5,738 t of biological oxygen demand, 7,600 t of suspended solids, 898 t of ammonia nitrogen, \n1,234 t of total nitrogen, and 88 t of total phosphorus. Water and soil pollution will be indirectly \nreduced due to lower rates of pollutant transfer from air to water, with reduced stress on local \necosystems. The quantifiable local environmental benefits over the project life are expected to \nbe about CNY52.2 million in net present value at 2004 prices. The global environmental benefits \nof greenhouse gas reduction (CO ) are expected to be about CNY43 million in net present \n2\nvalues  at  2004  prices.  Unquantifiable  environmental  benefits,  such  as  damage  from  the \nwastewater of small boilers and leaking gas, are also significant. The subcomponents will \ncontribute to the water pollution control for the Yellow River and Wuliangsuhai Lake. \n \nD.  Social Benefits and Poverty Reduction \n51.  ADB  commissioned  a  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  that  included  field \ninterviews  of  the  poor.  Consultations  were  also  held  to  gain  an  understanding  of  gender \ndifferences  in  the  consumption  pattern,  needs,  and  priorities.  During  preparation  of  the \nassessment,  various  participatory  techniques,  such  as  household  interviews,  focus  group \n                                                 \n11 The State Environmental Protection Agency has directed all areas to begin public awareness and disclosure \nprograms by the end of 2004. Most areas in the PRC have mature public awareness programs; many have already \ninitiated some type of expanded environmental information disclosure program. \n12 ADB. 2006. Summary Initial Environmental Examination of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Environmental \nImprovement Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n ", "17 \ndiscussions,  socioeconomic  survey  of  households,  meetings  with  enterprises,  and  site \nreconnaissance, were used.13 Many government organizations were consulted as well. The \npoverty impacts of the Project are assessed by evaluating the expected distribution of net \neconomic  benefits  to  different  groups.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy, \npresented in Appendix 11, summarizes measures to mitigate and enhance the impacts of the \nProject for the poor population. The approach only takes the direct project benefits into account \nin assessing poverty impact. The direct project benefits include (i) lower gas and heating tariffs \ndue to more efficient supply, (ii) environmental benefits, and (iii) job creation associated with the \nProject. \n \n52.  An  impact  assessment  for  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB's policy on indigenous peoples.14 The assessment indicates that most of \nthe affected minorities are Mongolians. The people of Mongolian origin are equal with the Hans \nin  land  distribution,  children\u2019s  education,  and  politics  where  the  two  groups  live  together. \nMongolians have their own special customs in religion, festivals, and house styles. The two \nethnic groups have lived together peacefully for a long time. The social survey shows almost no \ndifference in income level between Mongolians and Hans who are affected by the Project (net \nincome per capita of Han and Mongolian nationality is CNY3,300 and CNY3,200, respectively). \n \n53.  The Project will directly benefit an urban population of about 2.2 million in the eight \nproject beneficiary areas. Among these people, 0.96 million urban residents will benefit from the \nnatural gas and central heating supply with the Project. An estimated 71,324 or 7.5% of the total \nurban beneficiaries are poor as measured by the various city poverty lines. The increased use \nof gas and better central heating supplies will reduce the use of conventional fuels such as raw \ncoal, wood, and coal briquettes to mitigate environmental and health impacts, particularly on the \npoor.  \n \n54.  The Project will create about 10,240 person-years of employment opportunities during \nconstruction  and  1,412  full-time  jobs  during  operation.  Of  the  total,  4,090  person-years  of \nemployment opportunities will be filled by the poor, women, and minorities, with an estimated \ntotal  of  CNY44.2  million  in  wage  payments  during  project  construction.  In  addition, \n565 employment opportunities with CNY6.1 million of annual wage payments are expected to \ngo to the poor, women, and minorities during project operation. Local procurement of the \nmaterials required for the Project is expected to create additional jobs. The improved urban \nenvironment should enhance the local investment climate to attract more investment to the \nregion and act as a catalyst for future development. \n \n55.  The improvement of air quality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-related \ndiseases and associated medical costs, loss of working days, as well as human suffering in the \nproject  beneficiary  areas.  The  poor,  elderly,  children,  and  women,  who  have  less  coping \nresources and are more vulnerable, will benefit greatly from the replacement of domestic use of \ncoal  and  wood  with  gas  and  central  heating.  The  wastewater  treatment  programs  in \nWulateqianqi and Wulatehouqi will reduce wastewater pollution and result in improved living \nconditions and socioeconomic environment in the two areas. A benefit distribution and poverty \nimpact ratio analysis computed the poverty impact ratio of the Project (Appendix 12). The share \nof net project economic benefits directly accruing to the poor is estimated at 13.5%. Since the \npoverty impact ratio is substantially higher than the ratio of poverty population to total population \nin the project areas (7.5%), the Project is considered to be pro-poor. \n \n \n                                                 \n13  A stratified random sampling based on income for 600 beneficiary households was conducted. \n14  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila. \n ", "18   \nE.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n56.  Permanent  land  acquisition  for  the  Project  includes  10.2  ha  for  gas  transportation \nsubcomponents, 33.36 ha for central heating subcomponents, and 7.69 ha for wastewater \ntreatment subcomponents. The other subcomponents will result in a temporary disturbance to \nroads,  and  thus  require  compensation  payments  to  government  agencies  for  necessary \narrangements and support during project implementation. A total of 133 farmers will be affected \nby  permanent  land  acquisition:  20  by  gas  subcomponents,  102  by  central  heating \nsubcomponents, and 11 by wastewater treatment subcomponents. An additional 175 people are \nestimated to be affected by temporary land occupation for an average of 90 days during project \nimplementation.  A  socioeconomic  survey  of  all affected  households  was  conducted  in \nSeptember 2005. The impacts are minor and all those affected will receive cash compensation. \nTo mitigate the impacts, compensation standards and a rehabilitation plan are proposed in the \nresettlement  plan.  A  resettlement  information  booklet  will  be  distributed  to  all  affected \nhouseholds. A summary of the resettlement plan is presented in Appendix 13. GIMAR, the \nPMO, and the PIAs will ensure that all those affected are compensated in a timely manner and \nresettled in accordance with the plan. The PIAs will have additional consultations with those \naffected during project implementation. The estimated budget for resettlement compensation \nand rehabilitation is CNY26.95 million. GIMAR and the PIAs will ensure that all 784 workers \naffected by the closure of the small coal-fired boilers are reemployed in a timely manner and in \naccordance with the reemployment action plan prepared by the PIAs. \n \nF.  Assessment of Project Risks \n57.  A demand analysis was conducted to ensure sufficient demand for the gas, central \nheating, and water supplies generated by the Project. The risk of insufficient demand for the \nProject  is  minimal.  The  heating  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  gas  transmission  and \ndistribution improvement are to meet the existing demand and a small fraction of incremental \ndemand in the project areas. The Project does not require a higher gas tariff as the current \nalternatives (mainly liquefied petroleum gas) have higher prices. The average heating tariff of \nCNY15/m2 in IMAR reflects economic supply cost and is expected to increase mildly due to \nhigher coal prices. The expected improvement in facility efficiency by about 22% and billing \ncollection  to  95%  under  the  Project  will  improve  the  PIAs\u2019  financial  performance  without \nimmediate heating tariff adjustments. Strong economic performance is expected in IMAR, based \non the PRC\u2019s emphasis on the economic development of western regions and its large energy \nreserve. \n \n58.  The gas transmission and distribution, central heating supply systems, and wastewater \ntreatment under the Project are based on proven designs and conventional technologies that \nhave  been  used  successfully  in  the  PRC.  No  significant  technical  risks  are  anticipated. \nPrecautions will be taken to minimize potential risks during project construction and operation. \nThe risk of delay to loan effectiveness and construction due to late internal approvals and \nprocurement  is  being  addressed  by  GIMAR\u2019s  approval  of  feasibility  reports  for  all \nsubcomponents in April 2006, starting recruitment of implementation consultants in January \n2006, early preparation of bid documents in June 2006, and procurement training for all the \nPIAs in July 2006. The chance of large project cost savings will be minimal because of the \nrecent upward trend in the prices of construction materials and a prudent cost estimate. GIMAR \nwill mitigate the risk of inadequate project management by setting up the PMO with experienced \nprofessional staff who have had previous experience in design, construction supervision, and \nprocurement. International and national consultants will also provide assistance in these areas. \nIn addition, all of the PIAs will be subject to good governance supervision under the PPMS. \n \n ", "19 \n59.  To fully assess the potential project risks, a probabilistic risk analysis was performed \nusing the Monte Carlo simulation technique based on 3,000 simulations for both the EIRR and \nFIRR analyses.15 The crucial risk variables were selected because of their significant impact on \nthe Project\u2019s economic and financial viability. The results indicate that the expected EIRR, \nbased on the weighted average of all simulated combinations, is 17.8% or about 3.6% lower \nthan the base-case value, without consideration of project risks. The probability of the EIRR \nfalling below the cut-off rate of 12% is 7%. The economic risk is very low because the Project \nrelies on existing demand, and benefits from efficiency improvements. The results indicate that \nthe expected FIRR is 6.9%, about 0.8% lower than the base-case value, without consideration \nof project risks. The probability of the FIRR falling below the weighted average costs of capital \nfor the Project of 3.9% is 11%. \n \n60.  Poverty is associated with vulnerability. The dimension of risk in poverty assessment is \nof significance since the poor are the most vulnerable to unexpected unfavorable events. The \nexpected  poverty  impact  ratio  is  12.9%,  0.6%  lower  than  the  base-case  value,  without \nconsideration of project risks, and still higher than the share of the poor in the project area. Even \nwith pessimistic assumptions, the probability of a negative outcome for the poor is 4.3%. The \nrisk analysis of the poverty impact ratio calculation, together with the analysis of the probability \nof overall project failure (risk analysis of the EIRRs and FIRRs), concludes that the probability of \nnegative outcomes for the poor is minimal. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n61.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and GIMAR have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are included in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Closure of small coal-fired heat boilers. GIMAR will ensure that the PIAs \ncomplete the closure of 396 small coal-fired heat boilers in the project areas in \nIMAR  by  31  December  2009.  GIMAR  and  the  PIAs  will  ensure  that  all \n784 workers affected by the closure of the small coal-fired heat boilers under the \nProject  are  reemployed  in  a  timely  manner  and  in  accordance  with  the \nreemployment action plan so that they will be at least as well off as they would \nhave been in the absence of the Project. \n \n(ii)  Implementation  of  heating  tariff  reforms.  GIMAR  will  cause  the  PIAs  to \nprogressively implement, at the city level, key heating tariff reforms including \n(a) installation of lock valves in individual apartment units in buildings to improve \ntariff collection; (b) installation of radiator control valves in apartment units in \nbuildings  to  encourage  heat  conservation;  (c)  implementation  of  a  two-part \nheating  tariff  structure  that  the  variable  charge  shall  be  based  on  heat \nconsumption; the overall heating tariff level should be cost-reflective and promote \neconomic efficiency; (d) installation of heat measuring devices, at apartment \nlevel, to support consumption-based billing systems; and (e) conversion from \nenterprise-based tariff payment system to individual-based payment system. \n \n(iii)  Heating assistance to the poor. GIMAR will ensure the PIAs will implement the \npro-poor programs that provide heating tariff discounts to the poor based on the \n                                                 \n15 The simulation was carried out using Risk Master computer software. Monte Carlo simulation works by generating \na series of random numbers following the distribution of probability of each risk variable. For each simulation, which \nrepresents a combination of different states of risk variables, the EIRRs and FIRRs and poverty impact ratio are \ncalculated and recorded. The results of 3,000 simulations are averaged. \n ", "20   \ncost savings from efficiency improvement under the Project. GIMAR will ensure \nthe project areas will establish government-funded heating assistance programs \nto assist the poor and those with incomes marginally higher than the poverty \nlevel to pay heating bills. \n \n(iv)  Gas, heating, and water supply agreements.  GIMAR will cause the PIAs to \nsign and execute long-term gas, heating and water supply agreements with large \nprospective customers to ensure the demand of the gas and heating services. \n \n(v)  Financial performance of the PIAs. In each fiscal year commencing from fiscal \nyear 2007, the PIAs will be expected to maintain a debt-service coverage ratio of \nat least 1.4 times; and a current ratio of more than 1:1 by 2010 and thereafter, \nand a debt-equity ratio of not more than 70:30. \n \n(vi)  Change  in  ownership  and  operation.  In  the  event  (a)  of  any  change  in \nownership of the Project facilities or (b) any sale, transfer or assignment of \nshares or interest or other change of control in any PIA is anticipated, the PIAs, \nthrough  GIMAR,  will  consult  with  ADB  at  least  six  months  prior  to  the \nimplementation of such change. Such change will be carried out in a lawful and \ntransparent matter. \n \n(vii)  Institutional strengthening. GIMAR will ensure that the PIAs will implement, in \naccordance with the implementation plan agreed upon between GIMAR and \nADB,  the  agreed  upon  recommendations  for  financial  and  institutional \nstrengthening made by the consultants under component D of the Project.  \n \n(viii)  Environment. GIMAR and the PIAs will ensure that the Project is constructed in \naccordance with national and local government environmental laws, regulations, \nprocedures, and guidelines, as well as the ADB\u2019s policy on environment,16 and \nthe environmental impact assessment. GIMAR and the PIAs will ensure that any \nadverse environmental impacts arising from the construction and operation of the \nproject facilities will be minimized by implementing the mitigation measures in the \nEMP and the environmental monitoring plan. Environmental monitoring reports \nwill be submitted to ADB twice annually for 2 years during the implementation \nperiod.  The  EMP  (mitigation  measures,  monitoring  plan,  and  institutional \narrangements)  will  be  updated  during  the  engineering  design  stage,  and  be \nincorporated in the bidding documents and civil works contracts. \n \n(ix)  Land acquisition and resettlement. GIMAR will ensure that land acquisition \nand  resettlement  are  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently  following  the \nresettlement plan agreed with ADB, in line with applicable laws and ADB\u2019s policy \non  involuntary  resettlement.17 GIMAR  will  ensure  that  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan is monitored and evaluated and reported to ADB as required in \nthe plan. \n  \n(x)  Monitoring and evaluation. GIMAR will monitor and evaluate project impacts, \nwith the assistance of consultants, as specified in the PPMS, to ensure that the \nproject facilities are managed effectively and the benefits, particularly to the poor, \nare maximized. GIMAR will (i) engage consultants for monitoring and evaluation \nby December 2006; (ii) facilitate the data collection from local governments, \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2002.

Energy Sector and Environment \n1.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has severe environmental problems, including air \nand water pollution associated with rapid economic growth, heavy reliance on coal as the major \nfuel, use of obsolete equipment, and inappropriate planning associated with a centrally planned \neconomy. Estimates of economic losses caused by pollution range from 3.5% to 8.3% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Pollution in the early 1990s resulted in annual economic losses of \nCNY99 billion (about 4% of GDP at the time), with air pollution accounting for 59%, water \npollution 36%, and solid waste 5%.1 The high economic losses reflect waste and inefficiency in \nthe utilization of energy, raw materials, and water resources in the production of goods and \nservices. This is partly a legacy of the past practice of locating industrial enterprises in urban \ncenters, inappropriate regulatory measures, and pricing policies that did not provide adequate \nincentives for conservation and environment-friendly behavior. With rapid economic growth, the \nuse of energy, raw materials, and water will continue to increase. Without introducing better \ntechnology, encouraging use of cleaner fuels, and increasing use of renewable energy, air and \nwater quality will deteriorate and related economic losses will increase. The PRC's heavy \nreliance on coal as its primary fuel for industrial production, power generation, and commercial \nand residential applications\u2014mainly heating and cooking, contributes significantly to emissions \nof sulfur dioxide (SO ) and total suspended particulates (TSP), and high levels of urban air \n2\npollution. Air and water quality is poor in most of the PRC\u2019s industrial areas. Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (IMAR) has air and water pollution problems due to heavy reliance on coal \nas the primary fuel for industries and residential consumption. Most urban heating is provided by \nsmall, inefficient, coal-fired heating boilers. These small boilers typically are not equipped with \nadequate pollution control devices, and are the major sources of air pollution in urban areas. \nSupplementary Appendix A provides additional information. \n \nB.  Coal Subsector \n \n2.  The PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer with 2004 production of 1,950 million tons \n(t) of raw coal accounting for 34% of the world\u2019s total coal production. Coal provides more than \n75% of the energy for power generation, 65% of chemical raw materials, and more than 50% of \ncommercial and civilian energy. Coal accounts for 95% of the nation\u2019s primary fossil energy \nresources. Coal will continue to be the primary energy fuel for the PRC, partly because of \nincreasing thermal power capacity. Coal production was 1,400 million t in 1996. Gradually, as \nenergy efficiency improved and other sources of energy developed, coal production declined to \n1,000 million t in 2000. However it has been rapidly increasing since 2001. Coal production in \nIMAR totaled 72.5 million t in 2000, and increased to 203.3 million t in 2004. IMAR has over \n1,258 active coal mines. State-owned coal mines account for 65% of coal production capacity. \n \nC.  Gas Utilization \n3.  In the PRC, three types of gas are distributed: manufactured town gas, natural gas, and \nliquefied petroleum gas. The development of the natural gas industry and city gas utilization has \nbeen rapid in recent years. In 2004, the reserve of natural gas was estimated at 47,000 billion \ncubic  meters  (m3).  The  proven  reserve  was  4,900  billion  m3,  and  recoverable  reserve \n2,200 billion m3. Natural gas production and consumption were 40.8 billion m3 and 41.5 billion \nm3 respectively in 2004, which accounted for only about 3% of total primary energy production \n                                                 \n1  Based on a study by the Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy of the State Environmental \nProtection Administration. \n ", "26   Appendix 2 \nand consumption in the PRC. Natural gas consumption in the PRC was substantially lower than \nthe average level of 24.7% in the world in 2004. Most of the existing gas distribution systems \nare owned and operated by municipal gas companies controlled by city governments, and \nsupervised by the national Ministry of Construction. Gas prices for end-use consumers were \nsubsidized as a basic human need under the centrally planned system, but have recently been \nadjusted  nearer  to  market  prices.  IMAR  has  994 kilometers  (km)  of  town  gas  distribution \npipelines and 464 km of natural gas distribution pipelines. The most important end uses for gas \nare cooking, water heating, and to a lesser degree, space heating. The average gas price in \nIMAR, about CNY1.50/cubic meter (m3) (heat value of 5,000 kilocalorie/m3), is comparable to \nthe average of CNY2.10/m3 (heat value of 8,000 kilocalorie/m3) for other provinces in the PRC. \nThe growing demand for city gas has been outpacing supply. \n \nD.  Urban Heating \n4.  Urban heating demand in the PRC has grown rapidly due to rising incomes, privatization \nof housing, and housing sector growth. In heated areas, demand increased by an annual \naverage rate of 19.4% from 1996 to 2004. Urban heating demand grew rapidly during the past \ndecade because of economic and housing growth, and housing reforms that promote private \nownership. The total heated area of buildings in the PRC was only 734.3 million square meters \n(m2) in 1996, but increased to 2,166.6 million m2 in 2004. Residential buildings account for \nabout 70% of the total space heating demand, and commercial and public buildings account for \nthe remaining 30%. Only about 35% of total residential buildings were served by combined heat \nand power generation and/or urban central heating supply. The market penetration of central \nheating is relatively low, compared to the 55% to 60% range in developed European countries \nsuch as Denmark and Finland. About 500,000 small coal-fired heating boilers still operate in the \nPRC. The Government\u2019s policy promotes urban central heating supply systems using heat \nsupplied from efficient, large, combined heat and power generation plants and/or large heating \nboilers. Similar to the national trend, heating demand in IMAR grew rapidly during the past \n10 years. The total heated space grew at 18.7% per year, increasing from 32.18 million m2 in \n1996 to 92.15 million m2 in 2004. IMAR\u2019s current average heating tariff of CNY15/m2 is lower \nthan the CNY19.5 /m2 in Xinjiang, CNY20/m2 in Heilongjiang, and CNY24/m2 in Beijing, but \nreflects IMAR supply cost. \n \nE.  Wastewater Treatment \n \n5.  In 2004, municipal sources generated 65% of the PRC\u2019s estimated 46 billion m3 of \nwastewater; the industry sector generated 35% of the total. As the development of municipal \nwastewater treatment is still in the early stages, only 40% is treated. The rest is discharged \nuntreated into rivers and lakes. Although about 90% of industrial wastewater is treated, much of \nit is only pretreated to a low effluent standard before discharge into a municipal sewer and to the \nnearest  body  of  water.  Municipal  and  industrial  wastewaters  are  the  major  contributors  to \npollution  of  IMAR\u2019s  rivers  and  lakes,  affecting  downstream  water  quality.  IMAR  generated \n0.75 billion m3 of wastewater in 2004, 31% of which were generated from industrial sources. \nSimilar to the PRC\u2019s overall situation, only 44% of the total wastewater is treated in IMAR. The \nrest is discharged untreated into the Yellow River and Wuliangsu Lake. Wulateqianqi and \nWulatehouqi have no wastewater treatment facilities, and discharge about 86,000 m3/day of \nwastewater.  Recent  regulations  issued  by  the  local  governments  restrict  discharge  of \nwastewater to the Yellow River. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED \n \nA.  External Assistance \n \n1.  External sources, including foreign direct investment, are increasingly being promoted \nand now finance about 20% of total annual investment in the energy sector of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), mainly in the power sector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \napproved about $3.4 billion to the PRC energy sector to finance 27 projects in the public sector, \nand 2 private sector power projects. Of the power projects, thermal power projects account for \n41% in terms of loan amount, with hydropower projects accounting for about 36%, followed by \ntransmission and distribution (about 17%), and renewable energy (about 6%). ADB has also \nprovided 100 technical assistance (TA) projects for the energy sector for about $50 million to \nhelp prepare projects, provide policy advice, and build institutional capabilities of power utilities \nthat are the executing agencies of ADB loans. ADB has extended nine loans amounting to \n$1.5 billion for urban environmental improvement projects in the PRC, including district heating \ndistribution,  and  combined  heat  and  power  cogeneration  plants.  Four  projects  have  been \ncompleted and are in commercial operation resulting in improved overall ambient air quality in \nthe assisted areas. \n \n2.  ADB is providing TA to support the Government\u2019s reform of heating tariffs.1 The TA\u2019s \nobjective is to help the Government reform the urban heating sector and promote sustainable \nurban heating supply in the PRC by (i) formulating pro-poor national heating tariff guidelines, \nand (ii) establishing an effective heating tariff collection mechanism. The World Bank is also an \nimportant source of external funding for urban district heating. Since the early 1990s, it has \nprovided over $600 million to finance environment improvement projects. The central heating \nsystem components of these projects helped reduce polluting emissions from small inefficient \ncoal-fired heating boilers. In recent years, the World Bank has provided TA to support the \nGovernment\u2019s heating sector reforms. \n \n3.  Among bilateral sources, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is the \nlargest source of external assistance for the PRC\u2019s power sector. It has provided concessional \nloans totaling CNY438 billion ($3.6 billion at the current exchange rate) for 14 power sector \nprojects through its official development assistance window. JBIC has also provided special \ncredits to major areas to improve their environment by installing emission control devices and \nequipment in power plants and factories, and through building water treatment facilities. JBIC is \nconsidering shifting its traditional focus of assistance in the power sector from hydropower and \nthermal power generation to energy conservation and renewable energy, particularly in the \nwestern  region.  German  development  cooperation,  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau \n(KfW), has provided approximately $400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and \nturbine modernization projects. KfW also supported the Government in energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy development. Other bilateral sources providing export credits or mixed credits \nin the energy sector include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, \nand United States. \n \n4.  ADB has established a working relationship with the World Bank in addressing policy \nissues and coordinating lending and TA operations, and exchanges views with bilateral sources \nand the private sector. Both ADB and the World Bank emphasize the importance of improving \nthe management of power utilities, tariff reform, energy efficiency improvement, environmental \nprotection, and a greater role for the private sector. During the processing of the Project, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

The TA is nearly complete. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \ndiscussions were held with the World Bank, JBIC, and KfW to ensure that their respective \nactivities are complementary and to maintain consistency in policy advice. Some additional \ninformation is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nB.  Lessons Learned \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s overall experience with energy and environment sector projects in the PRC has \nbeen  positive.  Projects  are  generally  well  designed  and  smoothly  implemented,  although \nsubstantial  difficulties  have  emerged  in  some  projects.  Success  is  attributed  to  extensive \npreparation prior to ADB intervention, high degree of local ownership, effective leadership in \nproject  management  offices,  timely  policy  and  enterprise  reforms,  and  fortunate  market \nconditions. Delays in mobilizing counterpart funds are not uncommon, but in most cases have \nnot resulted in unsatisfactory performance. \n \n6.  Some problems in energy projects have arisen from inappropriate policies on energy \npricing,  especially  coal  versus  natural  gas  (and  urban  heating),  and  enforcement  of \nenvironmental  protection  requirements.  For  instance,  the  Xi\u2019an-Xianyang-Tongchuan  \nEnvironment Improvement Project, in general, was successfully implemented, but experienced \nthe cancellation of two cogeneration subprojects due to fuel pricing considerations, i.e., while \nnatural  gas  was  the  environmentally  favored  alternative,  existing  gas  pricing  would  have \nrequired subsidies of 30\u201350% to achieve a positive financial internal rate of return.2 \n \n7.  Persistent regulatory loopholes and weak enforcement of key provisions pose some \nproject risk: emissions fees for sulfur dioxide and other waste gas emissions are still set below \nthe  marginal  cost  of  abatement,  making  it  cheaper  for  large  coal-fired  power  plants  and \nsynthetic gas producers to pay the pollution discharge fees than to implement desulfurization \nmethods. Waste coal power plants are given some regulatory exemption from stack emissions \nstandards, based on the comprehensive reutilization principle. Sustained enforcement of total \nemissions quotas on a provincial and air-shed basis was at least partially successful in the late \n1990s, but construction and operation of large coal-fired power plants in the project area may \njeopardize the long-range emissions control plan. \n \n8.  Ongoing market reforms in gas and heating subsectors pose uncertainties in financial \nviability  of  project  enterprises,  particularly  state-owned  enterprises  in  the  early  stages  of \ncorporatization and commercialization. Ongoing environmental improvement projects3 illustrate \nthat market reforms and material price volatility can outpace project implementation with two \nextreme outcomes: (i) they may constrain enterprise profitability, or (ii) enterprise mergers and \nacquisitions may accelerate management and ownership reforms to the point that external \nsupport  is  not  critical.  A  recent  completed  project  performance  audit  report  of  a  similar \nenvironmental  project,  the  Tangshan  and  Chengde  Environmental  Improvement  Project, \nidentified  several  important  lessons  including  choosing  suitable  (not  the  most  advanced) \ntechnology, integrated environmental and financial impacts, and emphasis on implementation.4 \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1997.

Willingness-to-pay analysis indicates \nthat consumers are willing to pay substantially higher prices for water, and to a certain extent, \nare  willing  to  pay  for  wastewater  treatment.  Under  the  Anhui  Environmental  Improvement \nProject, tariffs were increased to levels commensurate with full cost recovery of operation and \nmaintenance costs.5 Capital costs were also being partially recovered through connection fees. \nUnder the Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project, loan covenants require \nwastewater tariffs to be increased to cover all operation and maintenance and financial costs \nassociated with treating wastewater.6 Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s post evaluation experience \nin wastewater, water supply, and water resources management in the Asia and Pacific region \nindicate that both supply and demand-side concerns must be integrated into project design. \nEncouraging broad reforms such as commercial management and introducing competition will \npromote efficient and responsive delivery of water supply and wastewater services. Appropriate \npricing policies for water and sanitation services are also required. Therefore, in particular, \nissues  related  to  tariff  levels,  cost  recovery,  and  commercialization  of  water  utilities  were \ncarefully addressed during project preparation. \n \n10.  These lessons were taken into account in project design and preparation. During project \npreparation, lessons of experience were addressed by (i) thoroughly evaluating the technical \ndesigns and technologies; (ii) ensuring an adequate debt-equity ratio for the implementing \nagencies; (iii) undertaking rigorous sensitivity analysis of cash flows, and financial and economic \nanalysis; (iv) incorporating institutional strengthening measures to improve the level of corporate \ngovernance; and (v) securing autonomy in operations and for procurement decisions by the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  project  management  office  was  given  proper  trainings  in \nprocurement and project administration. Institutional strengthening of the project implementing \nagencies will be implemented in parallel with loan-funded investments. Coordination with the \nWorld Bank and JBIC is active and ongoing, eliminating any overlap in assistance. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1996.

Demand Forecast \n1.  A demand forecast for each project component was carried out by the Government of \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region with assistance from the project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA) consultants. The demand forecasts concluded that the risk associated with \ndemand forecast is minimal (Supplementary Appendix K) because the Project will provide gas, \nheating  and  water  supply  to  meet  the  existing  demand  and  a  small  share  of  incremental \ndemand in the project areas. The Project will supply natural gas to replace liquefied petroleum \ngas (LPG) and coal for residential use (cooking and water heating), and a small portion of \nindustrial  consumption.  The  urban  central  heating  supply  will  replace  the  existing  small \ninefficient boilers. Water is in short supply in project areas and the demand for treated water \nunder the Project is larger than supply. The risks associated with the demand forecast in the \neconomic and financial viability analyses are minimal. \n \nB.  Least Cost Analysis \n2.  A least-cost analysis was performed for the three categories of end use to be served by \nthe Project, including (i) natural gas for industrial use and for household cooking and water \nheating,  (ii)  central  heating  supply,  and  (iii)  wastewater  treatment.  All  the  project \nsubcomponents are parts of their area development master plans. The least cost analysis used \n2004 constant prices and a discount rate of 12%. Tradable commodities were valued at border \nprices at the prevailing exchange rate (CNY8.11/$1.0). Non-tradable commodities were valued at \nshadow prices, using a mix of standard and specific conversion factors.1 The current alternatives \n(mainly LPG and coal) for some industrial use and household cooking and water heating in the \nproject areas are either more expensive or more polluted and the analysis indicates that natural \ngas is the least-cost option. For the central heating supply component, several options including \na  gas-fired  instead  of  coal-fired  centralized  heating  system,  coal-fired  household  heating \nsystems, and gas-fired household furnaces were evaluated. Based on an analysis of main \nfactors such as the coal and gas resources and their prices in Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion, and the local environmental benefits using gas, the least-cost analysis concludes that \nthe large-size centralized boilers for central heating supplies proposed for the project areas are \nthe least-cost option. The optimal size of the hot water boilers was assessed based on a market \nanalysis of present and future heating demands. The least cost analysis for the wastewater \ntreatment component was carried out to determine the lowest supply alternative that will meet \nenvironmental  standards.  Considering  the  technical  feasibility  of  small-scale,  individually \ninstalled wastewater treatment equipment and that there is no sewer system between the \nproject areas to the major areas with central sewage treatment plants, the analysis concluded \nthat the on-site sewage treatment plants are the least cost options. Equalized discount rates of \nthe lowest cost options and the \"without Project\" scenario were applied to all components to \njustify the economic viability of the Project. \n   \nC.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n3.  Economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were calculated for each project subcomponent \nand for the whole Project. Consistent with the least cost analysis, the economic analysis applies \n                                                 \n1  A standard conversion factor of 0.93 is used in the current project.  Border prices were used for all imported items. \nLocal costs were shadow priced using group and specific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 0.95 for steel, \n0.74 for cement, 1.1 for timber, 1.25 for skilled labor, and 1 for unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were excluded.  \nAll these conversion factors were based on ADB project in the PRC (ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of \nthe President to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Liaoning Environmental Improvement Project. Manila.) \n ", "38  Appendix 7 \nthe conversion factors for investment costs for land,2 equipment costs, fuel costs, and operation \nand maintenance costs, where applicable. The input data and assumptions were reviewed by the \nproject preparatory TA consultants and found appropriate. For the EIRR calculations, the benefits \nof output were based on (i) cost savings on alternative fuels, and (ii) incremental demand. The \ncost-saving benefits were the cost differences of the alternative energy supply options with and \nwithout the Project. A survey was carried out to determine the appropriate energy supply \noptions  for  each  category  of  consumers.  The  local  environmental  benefits  were  taken  into \naccount  in  the  EIRR  calculations.  Transmission  and  distribution  losses  were  based  on  the \nstatistics of historical line loss rates in each city. For the central heating supply and natural gas \ntransmission and distribution components, the benefits were based on the incremental benefits \nfrom resource cost savings, revenue, consumer surplus, and the local environmental benefits \nfrom reducing pollutant emissions. The main benefits of the wastewater treatment component \nwere the amount of wastewater treated and utilization of treated wastewater in the cooling-\nsystem of nearby coal-fired thermal plant and for irrigation. In calculating the project\u2019s EIRR, the \nincremental economic benefit of treated wastewater was assumed at 50% of the economic \nvalue of clean water. \n \n4.  The details of the economic analysis are provided in Supplementary Appendix L. The \nEIRR calculation takes a conservative approach, as it takes into account only the main benefits \nof  different  components  but  includes  all  project-related  costs.  This approach  yields  EIRRs \nranging from (i) 10.0% to 25.9% without and 14.0% to 40.0% with the local environmental \nbenefits  for  the  project  subcomponents,  and  (ii)  17.6%  without  and  21.4%  with  the  local \nenvironmental benefits for the whole Project. Sensitivity analyses were performed for each \nsubcomponent.  For  the  Project  EIRR,  sensitivity  analysis  showed  the  EIRR  (with  local \nenvironmental benefits) would decrease to (i) 17.6% if the Project was to experience a cost \noverrun of 20%, (ii) 12.5% if the benefits were reduced by 20%, (iii) 15.0% if the Project was to \nexperience a commissioning delay of 1 year, and (iv) 6.4% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happened. \n \nTable A7.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return (%) \n \n  Without Environmental  With Local Environmental \nSubcomponent  Benefits  Benefits \n     \nWuhai Central Heating Supply  22.1  26.4 \nDengkou Central Heating Supply  12.8  17.9 \nLinhe Central Heating Supply  10.0  14.0 \nHangjinhouqi Central Heating Supply  11.0  15.0 \nWuyuan Central Heating Supply  16.5  21.8 \nWulateqianqi Central Heating Supply  17.9  23.7 \nWulatezhongqi Central Heating Supply  14.3  20.1 \nWulatehouqi Central Heating Supply  15.8  19.3 \nChang-Wu-Lin Gas Transmission  20.4  20.4 \nGas Distribution and Station  15.4  16.8 \nWulateqianqi Wastewater Treatment  25.9  40.0 \nWulatehouqi Wastewater Treatment  12.5  21.2 \nThe Whole Project  17.6  21.4 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n2  Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n ", "    Appendix 7  39 \nD.  Environmental Benefits \n \n5.  An economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the Project was carried out \nbased on the benefits transfer method. The evaluation used (i) the methodology adopted in the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Economic Evaluation of Environmental Impacts: A Workbook (1996) \nto determine the adjusted estimate of the monetary damages caused by air pollution during the \nstudy period, taking into account the location of the pollution sources, emission level, and \npopulation affected; and (ii) estimates of average annual climate change for carbon emissions to \nevaluate the monetary damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The economic evaluation \nof  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  wastewater  component  was  calculated  based  on  the \ncriterion of collecting fees of wastewater in the project areas.3 The EIRRs presented in Table \nA7.1 have included only the local environmental benefits. If the global environmental benefits \nwere added to the project benefits, the Project EIRR would increase to 22.6%. \n \nE.  Risk Analysis \n \n6.  A risk analysis, using the Monte Carlo simulation technique, was carried out for the EIRR \nto ensure the Project\u2019s viability. Based on the foregoing considerations and sensitivity analyses, \ncrucial risk variables have been selected because of their significant impact on the Project\u2019s \nviability. The inputs for the risk analysis are taken from the base case benefit analysis over cost. \nThe correlation between risk variables is explicitly considered before the simulation to avoid \ngenerating  unrealistic  project  scenarios.  The  risk  analysis  for  EIRR  selected  six  variables: \nenergy sales, capital cost, input (coal, gas, and water) prices, implementation delay, exchange \nrate,  and local  environmental  benefits.  The  results  were  based on 3,000  simulations.  The \nexpected EIRR (without environmental considerations), based on the weighted average of all \nsimulated combinations, is 17.8% (with a standard deviation of 5.1%), about 3.6% lower than \nthe base case value without considering project risks. The probability for the EIRR to be below \nthe considered discount rate of 12% is 7%. The very low economic risk is expected because the \nProject mainly relies on existing demand and benefits from efficiency improvement. \n \n                                                 \n3  This methodology was used in the past ADB wastewater treatment project. \n ", "40  Appendix 8 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS \n \nA.  Summary of Past and Projected Financial Performance of Project Enterprises \n \n1.  The detailed historical and projected financial statements of the project enterprises for \n2003\u20132011 are shown in Supplementary Appendix K and summarized here. \n \n2.  Inner Mongolia Saiwaixing Huazhang Paper Limited Company. A private enterprise \nengaged in paper manufacturing, the company has its own heating system providing heat to its \nemployees' housing area. The company will implement the heating and wastewater treatment \nsubcomponents in Wulateqianqi. Wastewater from its paper mill has brought serious pollution to \nthe Yellow River, and its participation in the Project is in response to the provincial government's \nrequirement that it treat its wastewater. The company is structured into functional divisions and \nhas a board that meets regularly. Its finance division has 21 staff, and financial statements are \ncomputerized and comply with national and international accounting standards. Internal controls \nwithin the company appear to be adequate. The company has reported profits in the last 2 \nyears. It maintained a current ratio of 1.0 for 2003 and 2004, and the proportion of debt to equity \nwas 35% in 2003 and 28.8% in 2004. \n \n3.  Bayannur Fuyuan Shiye Group Limited Company. This company, a former state-\nowned  enterprise,  was  privatized  in  2003.  It  currently  operates  central  heating  facilities  in \nDengkou, Linhe and Wuyuan and expects to rehabilitate and augment these facilities under the \nProject. In addition to central heating, the company has business interests in the construction of \nboilers, real estate, and food processing. It has 1,007 staff, and is organized by operational \ndivisions with support from functional divisions. Its board of directors is appointed for a 4-year \nterm. The accounting system is computerized and financial statements comply with national and \ninternational  standards.  Internal  controls  within  the  company  appear  to  be  adequate.  The \ncompany\u2019s audit committee reports to the board. Its current ratios were 1.1 in 2003 and 0.8 in \n2004. Debt as a proportion to equity in 2004 was 35%.  \n \n4.  Wuhai Thermal Company. This fully state-owned enterprise, established in 1993, will \nundertake the Wuhai municipality central heating scheme under the Project. The company has \n170 full-time and some 300 seasonal employees. It is organized on a functional basis with \nfunctional managers reporting to the general manager. The company uses a manual accounting \nsystem.  Although  traditional  recording  of  transactions  is  being  done;  strategic  planning, \nforecasting, and decision-making roles of the finance function need to be strengthened. Internal \ncontrols and accounting procedures within the company need improvement. The company has \nbeen  reporting  losses  for  some  years  due  to  the  low  tariffs.  As  a  government  entity,  the \ncompany does not have any debt. Its financial performance is weak with inadequate current \nassets to meet its current liabilities. The company will continue to need government assistance \nin its operations unless tariffs are raised to meet the cost of operations. Assistance will be given \nto strengthen the company\u2019s financial management under component D of the Project. \n \n5.  Wulatezhongqi Dagong Thermal Limited Company. This state-owned enterprise was \nprivatized in 2004, and will undertake the central heating subproject in Wulatezhongqi under the \nProject. As a new company, it does not yet have a board of directors. The company is run by a \npresident and chief executive officer; its finance division is headed by an experienced qualified \nnational assistant accountant. While the company\u2019s financial management effectiveness cannot \nyet be assessed, it is expected to adopt adequate internal controls in its operations. Assistance \nwill be given to strengthen corporate governance and financial management under component \nD of the Project. \n ", "    Appendix 8  41 \n \n6.  Wulatehouqi Huibao Thermal Limited Company. This limited liability corporation was \nestablished in August 2005 with two main shareholders; Jianxin Group and Dong Sheng Miao \nMining  Company.  The  main  activity  of  the  business  is  heating  supply.  The  company  will \nundertake the Wulatehouqi central heating subproject under the Project. The company has a \nfunctional structure with deputy general managers reporting to the general manager, who in turn \nreports to the president. The company is in the process of setting up its finance division and has \nbeen informed that it should be headed by a qualified accountant. \n \n7.  Inner  Mongolia  Haosheng  Thermal  Limited  Company. This new privately owned \nlimited liability company was formed as a subsidiary of the Cashmere Wool Company, with its \nmain business in heat supply. It will undertake the central heating project in Hangjinhouqi. The \ncompany is headed by a president and is organized functionally. A chart of accounts and \nmanual of accounting is available, and the company is in the process of setting up its finance \ndivision. It is expected to adopt national accounting standards in the preparation of its financial \naccounts. \n \n8.  Inner  Mongolia  Western  Natural  Gas  Limited  Company.  This  limited  liability \nshareholding company was established in 2002. Its shareholders are principally state-owned \nentities. Since its establishment, the company has been involved in the construction of the first \nphase  of  the  natural  gas  pipeline  of  501  kilometers.  Its  participation  in  the  Project  is  to \nimplement the second phase of the gas pipeline of approximately 400 kilometers and expand \nthe distribution network. The company commenced commercial operations only in 2005 after \ncompletion of phase 1. The finance division is headed by a qualified accountant and its financial \nstatements  comply  with  national  accounting  standards.  It  has  a  computerized  accounting \nsystem and internal controls appear to be adequate. It also has an audit committee reporting to \nthe board. Due to the construction of the gas pipeline, it has a significant amount of debt, hence, \na high gearing ratio of 77% in 2004. Its financial performance is expected to improve as \ncommercial operations begin. \n \n9.  Wulatehouqi Water Company. This state-owned enterprise was established in 1981 to \nsupply water to Sai and Bayin townships. It will implement the Wulatehouqi wastewater plant \nunder the Project. The organization is structured according to two geographical regions under \nits control, each headed by a deputy general manager. Standard bookkeeping requirements in \nrespect of reconciliations and registers were carried out. Its financial statements comply with \nnational accounting standards. Its financial performance is rather weak and is supported by \ngovernment subsidy. Its revenue is mainly from water supply; this is expected to increase when \nit is able to charge for wastewater when the Project is complete. If the company is to be \nsustainable in the future, the tariff must be set at an amount to at least cover cost. Assistance \nunder Component D of the Project will provide the institutional strengthening it requires. \n \nB.  Assumptions Used for Financial Projections \n   \n10.  The financial operations of the project companies were projected for 2006\u20132020 based \non major assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Projections were prepared for the \nincome statement, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement for all the companies participating in \nthe Project. \n \n11.  The projected financial performance included the implementation and operation of the \nProject, which will be under construction between 2006 and 2009. Under the proposed loan, the \nproject companies will be required to maintain a debt-service coverage ratio of at least 1.4 times, \n ", "42  Appendix 8 \na current ratio of at least 1:1 by 2010 and thereafter, accounts receivable not to exceed the \nequivalent of 3 months of sales by 2010, and a debt-equity ratio at a maximum of 70:30. The \nfinancial covenants of ADB are expected to be satisfied during the life of the Project. The debt-\nservice coverage ratio is forecast to be adequate throughout. The debt-equity ratio will also be \nwithin the prescribed maximum limit. Other financial ratios are expected to remain satisfactory. \n \n12.  For the central heating projects, a 4-year construction period is assumed from 2006 to \n2009. Project costs were estimated by design engineers and reviewed by technical assistance \n(TA) engineers. The main raw material is coal; the use of more efficient boilers is factored in. \nThe  Linhe  and  Wuhai  facilities  also  use  heat  generated  from  the  power  plant.  The  other \nmaterials required are electricity and water, where the requirement was reviewed by the TA \nengineers. The current prices for these materials are used as the basis for financial projections \nand prices are assumed to increase by 0.8% per annum in real terms. The TA engineers \nestimated the direct and indirect staff costs and other operational overhead. Replacement of \nequipment is assumed to take place at regular intervals. Working capital increases are assumed \nbased on a 1 month inventory, 1.5 month average for receivables, and 2 months for payables. \nThe heating tariffs are segregated by domestic, industrial, and commercial tariffs; ranges vary in \nthe project areas. Regular tariff reviews are assumed to occur to ensure full cost recovery. \n \n13.  Both the city gas pipelines and the Chang-Wu-Lin transmission pipeline are assumed to \nbe  constructed  over  4  years  from  2006  to  2009.  Project  costs  were  estimated  by  design \nengineers and reviewed by the TA engineers. The main raw material is the gas itself, which will \nbe sourced from the Changqing gas field where the company has entered into a long-term \npurchase contract at CNY0.66/cubic meter (m3). The other materials are electricity and water, \nwhich are at current prices. The TA engineers estimated the direct and indirect staff costs and \nother operational overhead. Working capital increases are assumed based on 0.5 month for \nreceivables and 1 month for payables. The tariff is agreed at CNY1.45/m3, which is used for \nprojections. Technical and non technical losses are assumed at 3%. \n \n14.  The wastewater treatment subcomponents are assumed to be constructed over 4 years \nfrom 2006 to 2009. Project costs were estimated by design engineers and reviewed by the TA \nengineers. The main material requirements are in terms of electricity and chemicals, which are \nat current prices. The TA engineers estimated the direct and indirect staff costs and other \noperational  overhead.  Working  capital  increases  are  assumed  based  on  0.5  month  for \nchemicals, 1 month for receivables, and 1 month for payables. No wastewater tariff is currently \nin place and an assumed tariff is used to ensure full cost recovery. \n \n15.  These  subcomponents  were  aggregated  with  the  relevant  companies  to  provide \ncompany financial projections from 2006\u20132020. The projections assume that the proportion of \nthe subprojects financed by ADB, domestic banks, and equity is as given by the companies. \nThe cost of finance before tax by the ADB loan, domestic loans, and equity is assumed to be \n5.42%, 6.5%, and 8% respectively. The ADB loan is assumed to have a grace period of 5 years \nand be repaid in 25 years, while the domestic loans will have a grace period of 1 year and be \nrepaid in 5 years. Corporate taxation is assumed at the rate of 33% of the profit before tax and \ndepreciation  over  25  years  with  no  residual  value.  The  owners  are  expected  to  provide \nadequate equity at the required intervals to maintain a positive cash position. Working capital is \nprojected on the assumption that improvements in its management will take place so that they \nare brought down to acceptable commercial levels. \n ", "    Appendix 8  43 \nTable A8: Summary Financial Performance and Projections\n(CNY million)\n                                            Projected\nYear Ending December 31 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nA8.1: IM Saiwaixing Huazhang Paper Ltd.

General \n \n1.   This appendix describes the notes and assumptions used in the financial evaluation. All \nthe  costs  and  prices  are  expressed  in  constant  2005  prices.  The  economic  lives  of  the \nsubprojects are estimated at 25 years with no residual value. The financial operations of the \nindividual project implementing agencies (PIAs) for the Project are projected based on the \nassumptions described in Appendix 8. \n \nB.  Benefits and Costs \n \n2.  The benefits from the Project will be derived from the sales of output from the individual \nsubprojects based on the projected production levels and applicable tariffs. The capital costs \ninclude physical contingencies, but exclude price contingencies and financial charges during \nconstruction. The agreed transfer prices or projected purchase costs of inputs were considered. \nOther operating costs include personnel, distribution, administration, and other expenses. \n \nC.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n3.  The financial internal rate of return of each subproject was calculated after income tax. \nThe financial viability of the Project was subjected to sensitivity analysis under various adverse \nconditions. The sensitivity analysis results for the overall project are shown in Table A9.1. \n \nTable A9.1: Sensitivity Analysis of FIRR for the Overall Project \n \nProject Group    All Projects  Natural Gas  Wastewater  Central Heating \n  Change  FIRR  FIRR  FIRR  FIRR \nItem  Variable  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%) \n           \nBase Case    7.7  7.9  7.1  7.6 \n(i)  Capital Cost Overrun  10%  6.6  6.8  6.1  6.6 \n(ii)  O&M Cost Overrun  10%  6.7  7.4  4.7  6.5 \n(iii) Benefit Reduction   10%  5.2  5.3  6.6  4.9 \n(iv) Implementation Delay  1 Year  7.3  7.7  6.1  7.3 \n(v)  Combination of    2.9  3.3  1.3  2.8 \n  (i),(ii),(iii)&(iv) \nAfter-Tax WACC    3.9  3.7  3.5  4.0 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, WACC = weighted average cost of \ncapital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n4.  The weighted average cost of capital was calculated after tax in real terms, following the \nmethodology in the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment \nProjects Financed by the Asian Development Bank1 using actual capital mix and costs of funds. \nActual interest rates of local loan funds were considered. For the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) loan, the interest rate is based on the current London interbank offered rate on 5-year \nfixed-interest swap (currently at 5.48%) plus the ADB loan spread of 0.4%. The cost of equity is \nassumed to be 8.0%, and the cost of domestic borrowing 6.5%. The average domestic inflation \nrate is 3.0% per year. The income tax is 33%. The weighted average cost of capital is calculated \nto be 3.9%. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Methodology \n \n1.  The  economic  analysis  of  environmental  impact  requires  an  evaluation  of  avoided \nenvironmental costs of the Project, which are taken as environmental benefits/costs of the \nProject. For each subcomponent, the emissions from the Project and its alternative supply \noptions are studied to identify its environmental benefits (costs). The environmental impact \nanalysis is carried out in four steps: (i) major stressors or polluters are identified; (ii) impact \nscreening is carried out for each stressor; (iii) if the impacts are major, efforts are made to place \nmonetary valuation; and (iv) the benefits (costs) flows are quantified for integration with the \neconomic analysis of the Project. Details of the methodology are presented in Supplementary \nAppendix L. Table A10.1 describes the typical coal contents used by residents and industry in \nthe Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Based on analysis in Table A10.2, the annual avoided \nemissions of the major environmental stresses were estimated, including 1,792.3 ton of carbon \ndioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter (PM10), sulfur oxide and total suspended particulates \n(TSP)  which  were  calculated  as  the  emission  difference  of  the  project  component  and \nalternative  fuels  (liquefied  petroleum  gas,  propane,  and  coal)  for  consumers.  These \nenvironmental stressors are screened for their potential impacts on four major groups: human \nhealth, human welfare, environmental resources, and global systems. \n \nTable A10.1: Coal Quality Analysis \n \nItem  Item  Unit  Value \n  Heat value  Kcal/kg  5,300 \n  Total moisture  %  7.9 \nIndustrial Analysis  Inherent moisture  %  \u2014 \n  Ash content  %  21.4 \n  Volatile meter  %  15 \n  Carbon  %  57.4 \n  Hydrogen  %  3.52 \nElement Analysis  Oxygen  %  4.18 \n  Nitrogen  %  0.93 \n  Sulfur  %  0.46 \n\u2014 = not applicable., Kcal/kg = kilocalorie per kilogram.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  In modeling the effects of waterborne discharges, various factors need to be considered, \nthe most obvious being whether the receiving water system is a stream, estuary, lake, ocean, or \ngroundwater table.

While adjusting the data from the results of original research in the \nUnited  States  (US)  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  (Table  A10.4),  three  major \nadjustments were carried out for (i) GDP differentials between the US and PRC, (ii) updating of \nprice levels to 2004 constant prices, and (iii) medical cost level differentials between the US and \nPRC.

Environment Benefit Summary \n \n4.  The  total  emissions  were  computed  by  first  multiplying  the  emission  factors \n(kilogram/gigajoules) with the estimated heat production (gigajoules per year) at the conclusion \nof the 25-year analysis period for the reference case (small boilers). Then the emissions from \nthe central heating systems (large boilers) were estimated using the same method. The total \nemission reductions from project components were computed by comparing the emission levels \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n \nbetween the reference case and the Project components. For natural gas transmission and \ndistribution, the environmental benefits are the environmental cost differences of the alternative \nenergy supply options with and without the Project. Based on the externality cost of different \nfuels and the amount of air pollutant emissions, the environmental benefit due to the natural gas \ntransmission  and  distribution  can  be  calculated.  However,  calculating  the  incremental \nenvironmental  benefit  of  wastewater  treated  by  the  Project  is  difficult.  Considering  the \nexperience of the Asian Development Bank in wastewater projects in general and the country\u2019s \ncircumstances  in  particular,  the  economic  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the \nwastewater projects were calculated based on the criterion of collecting fees for wastewater in \nthe  PRC.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is  the  sector  identified  as  a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     national priority in country poverty   \n      No  partnership agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nIn line with the Government\u2019s energy sector strategy to promote socioeconomic development and to meet \nthe basic needs of the poor, increased clean gas and central heating supplies are needed to support the \nnational poverty reduction program. Adequate and reliable gas and central heating supplies are essential \nto human well-being in the cold Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Gas and central heating supply will \nreduce coal and wood burning that cause serious environmental and air-related diseases in the project \nareas. The poor, women, and children can be particularly vulnerable as they tend to be exposed more \nextensively to urban pollution than other population classes. A better urban environment can improve the \nlocal investment climate to attract more investment to the region and promote the development of the \nindustry and service sectors. Through careful design of project subcomponents and active policy dialogue, \nthis Project provides specific gas and central heating assistance programs to the poor so they can have \nreliable gas and central heating supplies in the winter. The Project will improve the quality of life for the \nlocal people. Overall, the gas and central heating supplies of the Project will complement the PRC\u2019s \npoverty reduction efforts. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Poverty Classification: General Intervention \nPoverty analysis has been treated as an integral part of project design, and is based on quantitative and \nqualitative methodologies. Project planning and design have made use of national, provincial, municipal, \nand  subproject  poverty  data;  and  involved  field  poverty  assessments,  questionnaire  surveys,  and \nstakeholder consultations, including with project beneficiaries. Participatory methods were used to identify \nthe local poor population and the provisions that would help to improve the quality of their lives. The \nProject will directly benefit a total population of about 2.2 million in the eight project areas. Of the total \nbeneficiaries, about 0.96 million urban residents will benefit from the gas supply and central heating \nsupply. About 71,324 or about 7.5% of the total beneficiaries are poor as measured by the various city \npoverty lines. The increased use of gas and heating supplies (including the closure of 396 small inefficient \ncoal-fired boilers) will reduce the use of coal and coal briquettes that cause environmental and health \nimpacts, particularly for the poor. The Project will indirectly benefit the entire urban population residing in \nthe eight project areas. The benefits for the poor from the Project include the following:  \n \n(i)  Job creation: The Project will create about 10,240 person-years of employment opportunities during \nproject construction and 1,412 full-time jobs during operation. Of the total, 4,090 person-years of \nemployment opportunities will be filled by the poor, women, and minorities with an estimated total of \nCNY44.2  million  in  wage  payments  during  project  construction.  In  addition,  565  employment \nopportunities with CNY6.1 million of annual wage payments are expected to go to the poor, women, \nand minorities during project operation. Local procurement of the materials required for the Project is \nexpected to create additional jobs. \n(ii)  Reduced environmental (outside and indoor) impacts: Through the development of methane gas \nsupply; improved and increased gas and central heating supplies; and closure of 396 small, inefficient, \nand polluting coal-fired boilers, the Project will reduce air emissions of sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, \nnitrogen oxide, total suspended particulate, and solid wastes in the project areas. This will result in \ntremendous socioeconomic and environmental benefits to the local communities and populations. \nImproved air quality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-related diseases and associated \nmedical costs, and loss of healthy working days in the project area. The poor, elderly, children, and \nwomen, who have fewer coping resources and are more vulnerable, will benefit disproportionately \nfrom the reduction in air emissions. Because women usually spend more time than men cooking; the \nlength of their exposure to smoke is higher. As such the Project will benefit women more than men. \n \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \n(iii) Enhanced quality of life for the poor: Survey results show that majority of the urban residents \nbelieve that the supply of gas and central heating and the disposal of wastewater will improve the \noverall quality of life, reduce housework for women, decrease health problems, increase comfort and \nentertainment activities, and facilitate longer study periods during the winter. \n \n(iv) Connection fee and tariff discount: The average heating expenditure burden (the ratio of heating \nexpenditure and the household\u2019s monthly income) of the poor in the project areas is high, ranging from \n17.5%  to  30.7%  of  their  total  household  expenditure.  Through  policy  dialogue,  the  project  city \ngovernments and the project implementing agencies (PIAs) have agreed to specific programs to help \nthe poor to pay for gas supply and winter heating. These programs will ensure the amount for gas or \ncentral heating that a poor household, as defined by the city poverty line, will pay is about 5% of the \nhousehold\u2019s monthly income. The PIAs will provide connection fee and tariff discounts to the poor. \nThese discounts will come from the cost savings from the efficiency improvement of the Project and \nfinancial profits of investment under the Project. If the household\u2019s payment plus the discounts given \nby the PIAs is less than the total gas or heating bill, the remainder of the gas or heating bill will be \ncovered by local governments. This approach is consistent with ADB policy that tariff subsidies should \nbe transparent and explicit, and that the government social objective should be separated from \ncommercial management of enterprises. A summary of the discounts to the poor planned by the PIAs \nand preliminary cost savings follows: \n \nA total of 52,337 poor households living under the city poverty lines classified for those with incomes under \nthe minimum living guarantee in the project areas will benefit from the gas and central heating supply \nconnection and tariff discounts offered by the PIAs. Of these, 22,971 poor households receiving the gas \nand heating supply connection will have annual savings of CNY10.2 million for the connection fees and \nCNY26.84 million for tariff reductions for the beneficiaries. The Project\u2019s city government-funded gas \nsupply and central heating assistance program should supplement the tariff discounts offered by the PIAs \nso that the poor households can have sufficient gas and heating supply.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder consultation and analysis was done during the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) \nand roles of each stakeholder were defined. The local governments and communities will assist the PIAs \nwith land acquisition, implementation of a short resettlement plan, and organization of local labor for \nproject construction. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region government (the Executing Agency), PIAs, \nand TA team undertook socioeconomic surveys and public meetings to raise awareness and gain local \nsupport. These processes enabled local stakeholders to express their opinions and to make relevant \nsuggestions. Specifically, intensive consultation of village leaders, rural poor, and women were conducted \nduring the TA socioeconomic survey on project impact and resettlement issues. The participatory activities \nare an ongoing process that will continue during project implementation. The poor and women will be \ngiven additional consideration during project implementation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA resettlement information booklet for the central heating subcomponent will be distributed to those \naffected  by  the  Project.  Further  consultation  with  those  affected  will  continue  throughout  the  land \nacquisition process. Ongoing consultations will be carried out by the PIAs to understand and meet the \nevolving needs and expectations of the users; increase awareness of the public about the benefits of the \nProject; and encourage the active involvement of local communities to maximize their support for the \nProject, promote gas and heating consumption and saving, and raise the social acceptance of user fees. \nThe consultations can take the forms of annual questionnaire surveys by consumer category, combined \nwith ad hoc community forums. Women\u2019s organizations and schools usually have extensive networks that \ncan be used for the distribution of information materials and survey questionnaires. To maximize project \nbenefits to community members in the project area, the PIAs will ensure that the contractors maximize \nhiring laborers for project construction from local communities and provide necessary training. A social \ndevelopment action plan was prepared to address mitigation and enhancement measures to maximize \nproject benefits to the communities in the project area. \n ", "  Appendix 11  53 \nD.  Gender Development  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n   \nTo  maximize  the  project  benefits  to  women,  preferential  policies  will  be  given  to  women  for  the \nemployment and training opportunities generated from the construction and operation phases, and the \nproposed poverty reduction programs of the Project. Women\u2019s needs and interests will be represented \nduring project implementation. The PIAs will adopt a proactive employment system and targeted training \nprograms for women.

Methodology \n1.  The poverty impacts of the Project are assessed by evaluating the expected distribution \nof net economic benefits among different groups. The approach takes only the direct project \nbenefits into account in assessing poverty impact. The direct project benefits include resource \ncost savings, revenue, consumer surplus, and the local environmental benefits from reducing \npollutant emissions and water pollution. The methodology involves three steps: (i) estimate the \npresent value of net financial and economic benefits by participating group; (ii) for each group, \ndeduct the financial benefits from the economic benefits to give the distribution of net economic \nbenefits; and (iii) assign the net economic benefits (NEB), accruing to the poor, according to the \nproportion of each group that is poor. A poverty impact ratio expressing the proportion of NEB \naccruing to the poor can be calculated by comparing the NEB to the poor with the NEB of the \nProject as a whole.1 The analysis used constant 2004 prices, a standard conversion factor of \n0.93, and a discount rate of 12%. Tradable commodities were valued at border prices at the \nprevailing exchange rate. Nontradable commodities were valued at shadow prices, using a mix \nof  standard  and  specific  conversion  factors.  Net  financial  benefits  (NFB)  and  NEB  are \nexpressed in yuan (CNY). \n \nB.  Benefit Distribution \n \n2.  The  NFB  are  equal  to  sales  revenue  of  CNY5.926  million  minus  capital  costs  of \nCNY1.682 million, operating costs of CNY3.594 million, labor costs of CNY449 million, and \nincome taxes of CNY309 million. The NFB of the Project shows a loss of CNY108 million in net \npresent value at a 12% discount rate (Table A12). The NEB of the Project expressed at the \ndomestic price level are CNY866 million. They are equal to gross benefits of CNY6,771 million \n(including  consumer  surplus  and  environmental  benefits) minus  capital  costs  of  CNY1.723 \nmillion, operating costs of CNY3.745 million, and labor costs of CNY437 million (wages valued \nat the shadow price of labor for both skilled and unskilled labor). The difference between the \nNEB and NFB is distributed by groups. The difference of CNY974 million is made up of (i) \nconsumer surplus of CNY302 million (mainly in terms of the difference between the without-\nproject cost of gas and heating supply and the with-project expenditure on gas and heating plus \nthe value of gas and heating supply consumed but not paid for; (ii) the environmental benefits of \nCNY543 million from efficiency improvement, closure of small coal-fired boilers, and disposal of \nwastewater; (iii) the difference between financial and economic cost of capital investment and \noperating costs of CNY41 million and CNY151 million, respectively (mainly due to government \ntaxes and duties, overvaluation of the exchange rate, and other price distortions); (iv) loss to \nskilled labor of CNY49 million (current wages less opportunity cost of labor); (v) gain of unskilled \nlabor of CNY61 million; and (vi) income taxes of CNY309 million. \n \n3.  The differences between the NEB and NFB give rise to losses and gains among the \nproject participants. Considering the overall result of NFB of negative CNY108 million and NEB \nof CNY866 million for the Project, the NEB exceeds the NFB by CNY974 million. Skilled labor \nwill lose CNY49 million and unskilled labor gain CNY61 million at the project wage levels, which \nare lower (higher) than the opportunity costs, while consumers will gain from their consumer \nsurplus of CNY302 million. The investor (project companies) of the Project will lose CNY108 \nmillion at a discount rate of 12%. Since this is a public sector loan and project companies are \nstate-owned enterprises or guaranteed by the Government, the CNY108 million losses could be \n                                                 \n1  The poverty  impact ratio  is based on the distribution  of project net benefits. This differs from the project \nclassification criterion of the Asian Development Bank, which is expressed in terms of the number of beneficiaries. \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \n \nconsidered as the Government's financial loss from investing in the Project (unable to invest in a \nproject with 12% financial return). The environmental benefits of CNY543 million and income \ntaxes of CNY309 million will be considered as the gains to the Government from a national \nperspective. Subtracting the gains of CNY41 million from capital costs and CNY151 million from \noperating costs results in a net economic gain to the Government of CNY660 million. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Ratio \n \n4.  The differences between the financial and economic values, and the consequent gains \nand losses for different project participants, provide the basis for considering the impact of the \nProject on the poor. The poor account for 7.5% of the people living in the project area.2 The \nincremental  gas  and  better  heating  supply  could  benefit  the  urban  poor  more  as  their \nconsumption is projected to increase faster because of their current low consumption levels. \nThe government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (GIMAR) agreed to ensure that \nproject areas consider establishing heating assistance programs for the poor with adequate \nannual  government  budget.  Cost  savings  resulting  from  the  efficiency  improvement  of  the \nProject will be passed on to the poor in the form of heating bill discounts. These programs will \nbe designed to alleviate the affordability problems in the project areas. Based on the projected \nshare of urban consumers, their consumption pattern, number of the poor living below the \npoverty  line,  projected  cost  savings,  and  the  estimated  tariff  reduction,  the  share  of  the \nconsumer surplus going to the poor is estimated at 7.0%. \n \n5.  From a national perspective, the gains of CNY660 million (the gains of the Government) \nare mainly the environmental benefits and income taxes with the Project. Some Government \nlosses are from capital investment and operating costs (CNY41 million and CNY151 million, \nrespectively). The loss is further offset by the financial losses of CNY108 million (at 12% \ndiscount rate). A 2001 Asian Development Bank (ADB) publication indicates that the poor are \ndisproportionately affected by environmental degradation and benefit more from environmental \nimprovement.3 Without the Project, the poor would not have information about and access to, or \ncould not afford more efficient (less-polluting) equipment and fuels. The water, gas distribution, \nand heating supply networks are usually less well functioning or absent in the poorer sections of \nthe areas. Based on the household survey, most non-poor have access to existing water, gas, \nand heating supplies. The inadequate water, gas, and heating supply to the poor increase the \nexposure of the poor to daily doses of pollutants because of using coal and poor quality water \nfor domestic consumption, as well as the risk of accidents. Therefore, the reduction of local \nenvironmental pollution will benefit the poor substantially more. Based on the household survey, \ndemand forecast, and discussions with the Executing Agency\u2014GIMAR, the local environmental \nprotection  agency,  and  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultants,  this \nanalysis estimates that the share of the government\u2019s net benefits (environmental benefits) \ngoing to the poor living below the poverty line will be 17%. \n   \n6.  The direct employment effect of the Project during construction is an important project \nbenefit. The local currency portion of the Project is about 58% of the project cost. Of the 58%, \nthe nonequipment portion is substantial. Part of that will benefit the rural poor in the project area \nby direct employment. Since the poor are normally unskilled labors, they will be the beneficiaries \nof the Project as the current wages would be higher than their opportunity costs. Based on the \nprojected labor employed in the Project through a special employment program for the poor, \nparticularly in gas distribution and central heating supply subcomponents, 15% of the surplus for \nunskilled labor will go to the urban poor. \n                                                 \n2  The poverty lines used in the poverty analysis are the official urban poverty lines in the project areas. \n3  ADB. 2001. Moving the Poverty Reduction Agenda Forward in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 12  57 \n \n7.  The requirement of a project disproportionately benefiting the poor translates into (i) an \neconomic internal rate of return of 12% or above, and (ii) a poverty impact ratio significantly \ngreater than the poor's share in GDP, which is usually lower than the number of poor in the \nproject areas. Table A12 shows that the NEB directly accruing to the poor are CNY117 million. \nThe  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  ratio,  which  expresses  the  proportion  of  NEB  of  the  Project \naccruing to the poor, is 13.5%; this is higher than the ratio of the poverty population in the \nproject area of 7.5%. The calculation of poverty impact ratio is based on the direct benefits of \nthe Project. All other indirect benefits are not captured in the poverty impact ratio. \n \nD.  Conclusion \n \n8.  The analysis concludes that the Project will support pro-poor economic growth. The risk \nanalysis on the poverty impact ratio calculation, together with the analysis on the probability of \noverall project failure, concludes that the probability of a negative outcome for the poor is \nminimal. \n \nTable A12: Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n(Present values at 12%, in CNY million) \n \n   Accounts    Beneficiaries \nItem  Financial Economic        Government   \n    Accounts Accounts  Difference   Consumers Economy  Labor  Total \n                   \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Environment Improvement Project \nwill finance the construction of (i) a gas transportation system from Changqing gas field to \nWuhai and Bayannur municipalities, (ii) a central heating system in Wuhai and Bayannur, and \n(iii)  two  wastewater  treatment  plants  in  Bayannur.  The  resettlement  plan  covers  all  three \ncomponents and is based on the project feasibility study. Since relatively few people will be \naffected by the Project, the Executing Agency, the government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion (GIMAR), and project implementation agencies (PIAs) conducted detailed village-level \nimpact assessments. The resettlement plan will be revised after the completion of the detailed \nmeasurement survey and submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for approval prior to \ncommencement of land acquisition. \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition \n \n2.  The Project will affect 18 townships and 23 administrative villages in 12 counties, in \nWuhai, Erdos, and Bayannur municipalities. According to the impact survey during the feasibility \nstudy, a total 51.56 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, of which 32% (16.36 ha) is farmland. \nSixty-eight percent is wasteland and sandy land (35.19 ha). A total of 10.21 ha will be occupied \nby the gas transportation system, 33.36 ha by the central heating system, and 7.69 ha by \nwastewater treatment plant. Another 653.45 ha will be occupied temporarily for an average \nperiod  of  90  days  during  construction.  Based  on  per  capita  farmland  in  affected  villages, \n133 people (30 households) will be affected by the permanent land acquisition and an additional \n175  are  estimated  to  be  affected  by  the  temporary  land  occupation.  As  well  as  the  land \nacquisition, other affected assets include trees and electricity poles that have to be removed. No \nhousing relocation is expected under the Project. All land and other assets will be compensated \nat replacement value. \n \nC.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n3.  For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome and living standards in line with the PRC Land Administration Law (1998) and ADB\u2019s \npolicy on involuntary resettlement.1 The project management office (PMO) under GIMAR will \nensure that any people losing land, housing, other assets, or income sources will be assisted to \nfully restore their income and living standards. In 2000, GIMAR issued a land administration \ndecree to implement the 1998 Land Administration Law, and in 2004 issued a special decree \nconcerning  land  compensation,  which  stipulates  the  regulations  for  land  compensation, \nresettlement  subsidies,  young  crop  compensation,  and  other  measures  to  carry  out \nresettlement.  According  to  the  policy  and  basic  socioeconomic  conditions  among  project \ncounties, detailed compensation rates will be agreed upon for each affected county. For the \nresettlement plan, a comprehensive compensation rate for land compensation including young \ncrops has been estimated at ranging from CNY1,531 per ha to CNY2,459 per ha for cultivated \nland; and from CNY306 per ha to CNY699 per ha for wasteland. People losing land temporarily \nduring construction will receive a payment equivalent to production value foregone for the period \nof loss, which is expected to be 1 year. The Project will arrange construction work occupying the \nfarm land to take place during the winter so as to reduce the impact on production. The land \nused temporarily will also be restored by the contractor to the original condition. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 13  59 \n \nD.  Resettlement Strategy \n \n4.  Efforts to minimize resettlement effects have been made after consultations with local \nofficials during the setting of the alignment for the feasibility study. The selected alignment will \navoid towns, villages, and high-yield crop and fruit gardens. Heating source sites are arranged \nas much as possible on land not in use in urban planned areas or established heating source \nplants. Heating stations are arranged in established boilers or reserved land in urban plans. \nPipe will be laid along the established roads in areas. Therefore, no houses will be demolished. \nEfforts have been made to place wastewater treatment subprojects to minimize the use of \ncultivated land. The wastewater treatment subproject will occupy collective wasteland. For those \nunavoidably  affected,  the  resettlement  strategy  is  to  replace  losses  of  land,  other  assets, \ninfrastructure, and income. \n  \n5.  Higher  than  average  compensation  rates  and  various  rehabilitation  measures  are \nproposed. GIMAR will ensure that the resettlement entitlements are provided to those affected \nbefore ground clearance. A land compensation and resettlement subsidy will be paid directly to \nthe  affected  individuals.  Compensation  for  young  crops  and  other  assets  will  be  provided \ndirectly to people losing those assets. Compensation for infrastructure such as electrical and \ncommunication fixtures will be paid to the government departments concerned, for restoration. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n6.  GIMAR will assume overall responsibility for implementing resettlement according to the \napproved resettlement plan. A project leading group for resettlement within the PMO and PIAs \nwill be directly responsible for coordination of the planning, implementation, financing, and \nreporting  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  the  Project.  Both  leading  group  and \nresettlement offices, each comprising three staff members will be established in three areas, \nwith two staff members for 12 affected counties (districts). The county resettlement offices will \ntake primary responsibility for the resettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery \nof entitlements, with assistance from concerned townships and villages. \n \nF.  People Affected by the Project  \n \n7.  A total of 133 people (30 households) will be affected by the permanent land acquisition \nand an additional 175 are estimated to be affected by temporary land occupation. Among those \naffected by the permanent land acquisition, 16 Mongolians will be affected by the Project. No \nMongolian village is located in the project area. Since Mongolians have been closely integrated \nin the current social system with no distinctive isolation or barriers, the compensation and \nrehabilitation adopted for affected Mongolians will be the same as those for Hans. The social \nsurvey shows that almost no difference of income between Mongolians and Hans among those \naffected by the permanent land acquisition (net income per capita of Hans and Mongolians is \nCNY3,300 and CNY3,200, respectively). \n \n8.  No  economically  vulnerable  people,  including  elderly  living  alone,  disabled,  and \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  are  among  those  affected  by  permanent  land  acquisition. \nAverage annual net income per capita of those affected is CNY3,549 or $438 as compared to \nthe national poverty line of CNY637 or $78.55 per capita per year. All those affected have \nincome sources from nonagricultural activities, which range from 6% to 72% of their total gross \nincome.  \n \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \nG.  Consultation and Grievance Redress \n \n9.  The 1998 Land Law and document 28, 2004 requires disclosure and consultation with \npeople affected by a project. The people affected have been notified about the key elements of \nthe resettlement plan during meetings and interviews. During detailed resettlement planning, \nfurther consultations arranged by township and village officials will discuss specific impacts in \neach village and how they will be addressed.  \n \n10.  In  February  2006,  GIMAR  and  relevant  county  resettlement  offices  distributed  a \nresettlement information booklet to all affected townships and villages. The information booklet \ncontains the resettlement scope, expected time frame, compensation rates for land and other \nassets, other assistance to replace assets, and the grievance redress mechanisms. The county, \ntownship, and village officials will ensure that any concerns raised by the people affected are \nquickly addressed. \n \n11.  In case of grievances, all complaints will be processed based on Government Regulation \nNumber 431 on Grievance and Redress effective 1 May 2005. Affected people will submit their \noral or written complaint first to the village committee or the township resettlement office. If their \ncomplaint is not settled in 2 weeks, they can seek redress at the county resettlement office \nwithin 1 month. If still unresolved within 2 weeks, a project leading group for resettlement within \nthe PMO/PIAs will try to achieve a solution. The final redress will be sought, if necessary, in the \ncivil courts, in accordance with the Civil Procedures Act. \n \nH.  Monitoring and Reporting \n \n12.  The  plan  for  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  included  in  the \nresettlement plan. The GIMAR and PIAs will engage a qualified domestic monitoring agency to \ncarry out independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation. The independent monitoring \nagency  will  ascertain  the  extent  to  which  the  affected  people  have  (i)  received  their  full \nentitlements on time; and (ii) fully restored their livelihoods, income levels, and living standards. \nIt  will  also  conduct  a  baseline  survey  prior  to  resettlement,  semiannual  monitoring  and \nevaluation during resettlement, and evaluation 1 year after completion of land acquisition. The \nhousehold survey will include a representative number of those severely affected by loss of land \nand  those  classified  as  a  minority  and  economically  vulnerable.  The  independent  external \nmonitoring agency will provide ADB and GIMAR with copies of the monitoring and evaluation \nreports to be prepared twice a year during resettlement implementation and once a year after \nresettlement completion. \n \n13.  A quarterly reporting system will be established in the project resettlement office in \nGIMAR and PIAs. GIMAR and PIAs will report to ADB on the progress of land acquisition \nthrough resettlement progress reports. After completion of land acquisition, GIMAR and PIAs \nwill prepare a resettlement completion report and submit to ADB. \n \nI.  Finance and Implementation Schedule \n \n14.  The  budget  estimate  is  CNY26.95  million  or  $3.3  million,  for  all  costs  including \ncompensation,  payments  for  other  assets  for  public  infrastructure  and  trees,  fees  for \nresettlement  administration,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  contingencies.  GIMAR  will \nguarantee to supplement the resettlement budget, as necessary, to meet any shortfall that \nemerges in achieving the resettlement objectives. \n \n ", "Appendix 13  61 \n15.  The resettlement implementation schedule has been prepared based on the project \nconstruction timetable agreed to by GIMAR with ADB (Table A13). Land acquisition is expected \nto commence by May 2006 and be completed by September 2006. GIMAR will update the \nresettlement plan after completion of the detailed measurement survey and submit it to ADB for \napproval prior to commencement of land acquisition.  \n \nTable A13: Work Plan and Schedule for Resettlement Planning \n(as of 20 March 2006) \n \nItem  Schedule  Responsible Agency \n1 Sep 2005 \n1.
