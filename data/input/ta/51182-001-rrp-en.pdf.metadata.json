THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the National Solar Park Project. The report also describes (i) the \nproposed administration of a loan and a grant to be provided by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF),1 \nand (ii) the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Republic of \nKorea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for Capacity Development in the Electric Utility \nIndustry. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the administration of the SCF loan, the SCF grant, and the TA. \n \n2.  The project will support the expanded deployment of solar photovoltaic power plants in \nCambodia and address the country\u2019s need to (i) expand low-cost power generation; (ii) diversify the \npower generation mix with an increase in the percentage of clean energy, in line with its greenhouse \ngas emission reduction targets2; and (iii) expand the use of competitive tenders and other global best \npractices in the energy sector. The project will support the national electricity utility, Electricite du \nCambodge (EDC), in constructing a 100-megawatt (MW) capacity solar power park (comprising civil \nworks, including access roads, fencing, and drainage systems) and a transmission interconnection \nsystem to the nearest grid substation.3 Through a transaction advisory services (TAS) agreement \nbetween the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nEDC, the project also aims to help EDC design and conduct a competitive tender for procuring an \nindependent power producer to build the first  solar power plant within the park.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Since 2010, the Government of Cambodia has made significant progress in developing the \ncountry\u2019s power network. The expansion of distribution networks to increase electrification rates and \nexpansion and diversification of national generation capacity beyond diesel plants have helped the \ngovernment lower power prices and meet high annual growth in demand that averaged 16% during \n2011\u20132017.  These  efforts  have  contributed  to  high  economic  growth  and  substantial  poverty \nreduction, but Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product per capita, estimated at $1,427 in 2017, remains \namong the lowest in Southeast Asia, and nearly 5 million Cambodians lack access to electricity. \nContinued investment to expand the supply of electricity from sustainable and affordable sources \nwill improve Cambodia\u2019s economic competitiveness and the welfare of its people. \n \n4.  Energy sector status. At the end of 2017, Cambodia\u2019s installed capacity totalled 1,878 MW:  \nhydropower accounted for 980 MW (52%), coal-fired generation for 564 MW (30%), diesel for 295 \nMW (16%), biomass for 29 MW (less than 2%), and solar for 10 MW (less than 1%) (footnote 2). The \nhydropower and coal-fired plants are owned by the private sector and operated under long-term \npower purchase agreements, which were contracted through unsolicited bids with take-or-pay \narrangements. In addition to domestic generation, about 18% of the electricity supply is imported \nfrom Thailand and Viet Nam. In 2017, 82% of villages and 69% of households had access to \nelectricity. \n \n                                                \n1   The SCF grant is funded through the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries. \n2   Electricity Authority of Cambodia. 2018.

Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2018\u2013\n2020. Manila. \n4   The solar power plants will be tendered to independent power producers in two phases. The first phase is 60 MW. The \nsecond phase will procure 40 MW, for a total of 100 MW. \n \n ", "2 \n5.   The Power Development Plan5 (revised in 2015) projects annual electricity demand of \n18,000  gigawatt-hours  in  2030;  demand  was  8,073  gigawatt-hours  in  2017.  The  government \nforecasts meeting demand growth through further investment in thermal generation (coal-fired in the \nshort term, and coal- or gas-fired in the long term) and large hydropower. Power imports, which \ncontributed significantly to meeting domestic demand since 2007, are being substantially reduced \nand replaced with domestic generation. Recent policies, however, have started a shift from coal and \nhydropower development to more sustainable alternative energy sources, particularly solar. The \ngovernment\u2019s Rectangular Strategy, Phase IV (2018\u20132023), highlights increased investment in solar \nenergy to reduce electricity costs and ensure long-term energy security.6 The government prioritized \nthe development of renewable energy in its National Strategic Development Plan 2014\u20132018 to meet \ngrowing demand for electricity in Phnom Penh and address the country\u2019s electrification target of \n100% of villages by 2020.7 The government\u2019s Industrial Development Policy, 2015\u20132025 identifies \nCambodia\u2019s  historically  high  power  tariffs  as  a  major  impediment  to  the  competitiveness  of \nmanufacturing, and calls for the development of more affordable alternative energy sources.8 In its \nNationally Determined Contribution to the 2015 Paris Agreement, Cambodia committed to reducing \nenergy sector greenhouse gas emissions by 16% from a business-as-usual scenario, by 2030.9 \nClean alternative sources, such as solar energy,  would help reduce the cost of electricity supply; \ncomplement installed hydropower-based generation, which is often inadequate during the dry \nseason; and provide ancillary benefits to the grid around the key demand centers.10  \n \n6.  To alleviate the impact of high residential power tariffs, in 2015, the government introduced \na tariff subsidy scheme for poor and vulnerable households. Customers that consume less than 10 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) per month are currently being charged about $0.12/kWh and those that \nconsume less than 50 kWh are being charged about $0.15/kWh. The current retail tariff for customers \nconsuming more than 50 kWh in and around Phnom Penh is $0.18\u2013$0.19/kWh.11 Lowering the cost \nof power has become a major government priority since the subsidy program began. At the same \ntime, the price of imported coal has increased, making coal generation less advantageous, while \nglobal prices for renewable technologies, such as solar photovoltaic, are rapidly decreasing. In \naddition, the development of coal and large hydropower plants is increasingly facing opposition from \nlocal communities and civil society. In 2016, the government announced a moratorium on the \nconstruction of large hydropower dams until 2020. \n \n7.  In 2013, the government, with support from development partners, began to seriously \nconsider solar energy generation. A technical study prepared that year by the Korea Photovoltaic \nIndustry Association for the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of the Republic of Korea and \nADB helped investigate the scope for developing a 100 MW solar power plant in Cambodia.12 In \n2015, a United States Agency for International Development-funded study explored the viability of \n                                                \n5  Chugoku Electric Power Co., Inc. 2015.

Other related development \npartner activities include expansion of the national grid (including grid strengthening for expanded \nrenewable energy generation), rural electrification, and capacity building.15 \n \n8.  ADB experience and strategic alignment. The government and ADB are developing new \nstrategic priorities for the country\u2019s energy sector. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 \nfor Cambodia,16 which was aligned with the Rectangular Strategy, Phase III (2013\u20132018)17 and the \nNational Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018 (footnote 7), focused on two strategic pillars: (i) \nrural\u2013urban\u2013regional linkages and (ii) human and social development. In line with these priorities, \npast investments focused on expanding access to the grid by developing transmission and sub-\ntransmission lines and increasing household connections.18 The Rectangular Strategy, Phase IV \n(2018\u20132023) (footnote 6) promotes increased investment in renewable energy, particularly solar, to \nreduce electricity costs and improve environmental sustainability. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 similarly \npromotes  addressing  poverty  in  developing  member  countries,  tackling  climate  change,  and \nenhancing environmental sustainability.19 In line with these new strategies, ADB is supporting large-\nscale solar power generation in the country to improve the environmental sustainability of the energy \nsector, reduce electricity costs, and increase access to electricity, which can help drive economic \ndevelopment.20 In February 2016, the government\u2019s tender for a 10 MW solar plant at Bavet in Svay \nRieng Province resulted in a competitive tariff of $0.091/kWh, below EDC\u2019s average cost of supply \n($0.095/kWh  in  2015).  This  project,  which  is  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment, was commissioned in October 2017.21 Following the solar photovoltaic grid integration \nstudy, ADB completed a country-wide solar generation master plan for EDC (para. 7). An upcoming \nTA subproject will help the government develop a comprehensive energy sector strategy and power \ndevelopment plan.22 \n \n9.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s experience with the Bavet project, a small project \nwith demonstrational effect (footnote 21), highlighted the importance of long-term international debt \nfinancing and standard power purchase agreements, as prerequisites for low-cost solar projects. \nBuilding on this experience, the proposed project aims to demonstrate the ability of large-scale solar \nparks to further lower solar energy prices, while providing technical benefits to the national grid \n(footnote 10) and complementing hydropower generation. The project will be the first large-scale \nsolar park in Southeast Asia and will draw on ADB\u2019s experience with the solar park model in India, \n                                                \n13  R. de Ferranti et al. 2016.

Further, it will help EDC gain experience in procuring power from the \nprivate sector through transparent and competitive procurement, using standardized legal and \ncommercial agreements.  \n \n10.  The project represents a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach to providing end-to-end support to EDC. \nSovereign financing will be provided to help reduce private investment risk in solar generation \nprojects in Cambodia by building the solar park24 and transmission infrastructure. Ongoing TAS \nprovided by OPPP is helping EDC design and conduct a competitive tender for procuring the first, \n60 MW, power plant to be built by the private sector within the park.25 The TAS includes project due \ndiligence, including legal, technical, financial, environmental, and social aspects; pre-feasibility and \nfeasibility studies;26 and support for the development of tender documents and long-term power \npurchase agreements, the tender review, and the selection process. Finally, ADB, through its Private \nSector Operations Department, is exploring the potential of financing the development of the first \nsolar plant in the park (footnote 25). Overall project scheduling is being managed, so that the solar \npark will be completed seven months in advance of the commissioning of the 60 MW solar power \nplant.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: cost of electricity in Cambodia lowered \n(footnote 8). The project will have the following outcome: increase in private sector investments in \nsolar photovoltaic plants facilitated.27 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Solar park and transmission interconnection constructed. The project will \nsupport EDC in constructing a 100 MW solar power park in Kampong Chhnang Province and a \ntransmission interconnection system to grid substation 6 (GS6) near the Phnom Penh demand center \nto supply power to the national grid. The park will consist of 100 hectares (ha) of land, and associated \nconstruction works (i.e., fencing, roads, and drainage systems), to accommodate 60 MW of solar \nphotovoltaic plant capacity. The transmission interconnection infrastructure comprises (i) the 100 \nMW capacity pooling substation at the solar park, with two 50-megavolt-ampere transformers (and \nroom for two additional transformers); switchgear; an ancillary system; and controls; (ii) a supervisory \ncontrol and data acquisition system compatible with EDC\u2019s requirements, advanced forecasting \ntools, and expanded information and communication technology applications; (iii) a dedicated 40-\nkilometer 230-kilovolt double circuit overhead transmission line between the solar park substation \nand GS6; and (iv) two new bays with switchgear at GS6.28  \n                                                \n23  ADB.

Climate finance. Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $25.54 million, and ADB will finance \n25.34% of mitigation costs. Climate adaptation measures have been integrated in the main civil work \ncontract costs, and related costs are about $1.17 million. ADB will finance 100% of adaptation costs. \nDetails are in the PAM. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  EDC  will  be  the  executing  and  implementing  agency.  A  project  management  office \nestablished in EDC will have overall coordination and implementation responsibility, with support \nfrom (i) a PIC for supervision of project implementation and management; and (ii) an engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contractor for the solar park civil works, substation, and transmission \nline. Procurement of the PIC and the contractor will be initiated as advanced action to achieve high \nproject readiness. Because they have undertaken several ADB-financed projects, EDC and the \nproject management office have experience in and detailed understanding of ADB\u2019s procurement \nand  financial  management  policies  and  procedures.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2019\u2013December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2022 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(ii)  Executing agency  EDC \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  EDC \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Established in EDC, Phnom Penh \nProcurementa  Open competitive bidding  1 contract  $16.98 million \nConsulting services  Quality and cost-based selection (80:20)  90 person-months  $1.50 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting to recruit the project implementation consultant and \nprocure the engineering, procurement, and construction package for the solar \npark and transmission interconnection was done in Q1 2019. \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds (including ADB-administered cofinancing) will be \ndisbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government \nand ADB. \nAsian Development Bank; EDC = Electricite du Cambodge; Q = quarter. \n ", "7 \na  Since the project will be financed with ADB-administered cofinancing resources in the form of a loan and grant from the \nStrategic Climate Fund, universal procurement will apply to all procurement packages under the project following ADB. \n2013.

Manila. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n18.  The attached TA will support the capacity development of EDC and the Electricity Authority \nof Cambodia, the national electricity regulator, in solar photovoltaic technology and solar park \nplanning.32 In conjunction with inputs from the PIC and ongoing OPPP activities, the TA will focus on \ncompetitive procurement of power from the private sector and management of power purchase \nagreements,  and  technical  considerations  related  to  grid  integration  of  intermittent  renewable \nenergy. The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and workshop \nspace, office supplies, secretarial assistance, local communication facilities, domestic transportation, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  The project was assessed as technically viable with low technical risks. The transmission \ninterconnection line and pooling substation for the solar park will use standard technologies, and \nEDC has experience developing and maintaining similar systems. The system design has been \n \nanalysed, considering the assessed solar irradiation, load demand curve, grid conditions, and \nweather conditions. The substation will include remote monitoring and protection systems to stabilize \nthe grid in line with international design standards. Training will be provided by the PIC to EDC to \nsupport  the  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  solar  park  and  transmission \ninterconnection. EDC will also benefit from the TA subproject by further strengthening its skills in \npower development planning and grid integration of renewable energy (footnote 22). The climate risk \nassessment does not anticipate significant climate risks over the design life of the park (25 years); \nhowever, site level, drainage provisions, and access road design will take account of potential flood \nrisks.33 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  Economic due diligence assessed the project as a whole, including all components (i.e., land \nacquisition, construction of the solar park, and construction and operation of the 100 MW of solar \nphotovoltaic plants within the park). The project is economically viable with an economic internal rate \nof return of 20.0%, which exceeds the economic hurdle rate of 9.0%. Economic benefits are all \nderived from the incremental output of the solar photovoltaic plants to meet additional demand; the \nbasis for the valuation of these benefits was the consumers\u2019 willingness to pay. A sensitivity analysis \ndemonstrates that the expected economic performance is robust. \n \n21.  The project is financially viable with a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 8.4%, which \nis higher than the 2.6% (real) weighted average cost of capital. A sensitivity analysis was conducted \nto account for potential variations in financial viability. The project is financially robust, as the FIRR \n                                                \n32  Attached Technical Assistance Report: Capacity Development in the Electric Utility Industry (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n33  Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \nexceeded the weighted average cost of capital for all the sensitivity scenarios tested as follows: (i) a \n10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% reduction in generation output of solar photovoltaic plant at \nP50 generation levels,34 (iii) a 10% increase in operation and maintenance costs, and (iv) a 1-year \nimplementation delay of the solar photovoltaic plant.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  An assessment of EDC\u2019s procurement capacity found a variety of risks, variously assessed \nas low to high in terms of potential severity, but with ADB support such risks are unlikely to affect the \nprocurement process. The financial management assessment followed ADB guidelines for the \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects and the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology \nNote.35 It identified no significant concerns regarding the capability of EDC to manage the project \nloans and grant in compliance with ADB requirements. The financial management assessment and \naction plan, as presented in the PAM, have identified required improvements, such as the need to \ncomplete the automation of accounting and financial information systems and to extend the scope \nof the internal auditing department to include externally financed projects. Therefore, EDC\u2019s overall \npre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and EDC. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. Integrity due diligence on \nEDC followed ADB Operations Manual sections on anticorruption and on enhancing ADB\u2019s role in \ncombating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.36 No potential significant integrity issues \nwere identified with or relevant to the proposed project to be implemented by EDC. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n23.  The  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  improving  essential \ninfrastructure and providing clean and reliable energy. It will supply energy to economic and industrial \nzones in the neighboring provinces that employ or directly support more than 3,000 workers and \nsupport other direct and indirect local business opportunities. Clean energy will also avoid emissions \nfrom thermal power plants and the associated health impacts, which can disproportionately affect \nthe poor and vulnerable. The project is classified general intervention and some gender elements at \nentry. While it does not address poverty directly, the project is expected to indirectly improve well-\nbeing and expand opportunities for livelihoods of the poor. The project design includes measures to \naddress poverty, including engaging low-income households and poor women for construction work. \nThe project will comply with applicable national labor laws and core labor standards, including \nensuring equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity; and prohibiting child labor. \nIt will also include the provision of special assistance to households headed by women with \ndependents for any loss of livelihood or income, ensure that women represent at least 40% of \nparticipants during public consultations about the project, and ensure the EDC capacity building \ngender target is met. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories are as follows.37 \n                                                \n34  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); ADB. 2005.

Safeguard Categories. \n \n ", "9 \n \n25.  Environment (category B). EDC has prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nand an environmental management plan (EMP), covering environmental impacts and risks in the \nproject area of influence, including the solar photovoltaic plants, which are associated facilities; and \nGS6, which is an existing facility.38 The draft IEE has been disclosed on the ADB website, and the \nfinal IEE will be disclosed following the detailed engineering design. EDC will prepare a project brief \nin the local language, which will be made available at field offices. Public consultations have been \ninitiated to inform the project design and environmental assessment process and will continue during \nproject implementation. The PIC will provide support to EDC for EMP implementation and monitoring. \nEnvironmental complaints or grievances will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism. \nThe solar park site and transmission line right-of-way (ROW) consist of shrubland, rice paddies, \norchards, and plantations, with the ROW crossing a few small water bodies. No protected areas, \nsignificant migratory bird species and flyways, or other particularly sensitive environmental receptors \nhave been identified in the project area of influence. The identified impacts are site-specific and can \nbe reduced to an acceptable level through mitigation measures. Adverse environmental impacts will \nprimarily  occur  during  construction,  such  as  vegetation  clearance,  some  earthworks  and  site \nlevelling, dust, noise, vibration, disposal of construction spoils, occupational and community health \nand safety hazards, increased traffic, and disruption due to power outages (e.g., when constructing \ntowers and stringing conductors). The EMP (i) includes mitigation measures during construction and \noperation, including developing construction management plans; and (ii) identifies responsible \nparties and an implementation and monitoring budget. These measures and plans will be included \nin project bid documents.39 A climate change assessment was conducted and considered in the \nproject design, siting, and construction (footnote 33). \n \n26.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Based  on  preliminary  assessments  and \nconsultations, the project is not expected to have significant land acquisition impacts. Physical \nrelocation of persons or loss of income are not expected. The project is expected to require about \n220 ha of land, of which 100 ha is required for the solar park, including land for the first 60 MW plant. \nEDC is procuring land for the solar park through negotiated settlement. A land acquisition and \nresettlement framework has been prepared to guide EDC in case negotiation fails and involuntary \nland acquisition is required. The transmission tower footings along a 40-kilometer-long ROW are \nexpected to require 3 ha of land, and the 30-meter-wide ROW would require an additional 117 ha. \nThe land for the ROW will not be acquired. EDC has prepared a draft land acquisition and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP)  for  the  transmission  line  component  to  mitigate  impacts,  including \ncompensation at full replacement cost and allowances for the tower footings and the ROW. The land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  framework  and  the  draft  LARP  have  been  formulated  following \ngovernment laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and have been disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website. The project is not expected to acquire any land from customary landowners. No \nlong-term impacts are expected as the construction and operation will not restrict the community \nfrom accessing and using nearby resources. EDC's Social, Environment and Public Relation Office \nhas sufficient staff and capacity to plan and implement the LARP. In total, 226 persons (151 men \nand 75 women) participated in the public consultation meetings. Additionally, 86 women and 66 men \nparticipated in sex-disaggregated focus group discussions arranged at villages. EDC will continue \nconsultations with affected communities throughout the project cycle and use its grievance redress \nmechanism to receive, record, and facilitate the resolution of any concerns. The draft LARP for the \ntransmission line component will be updated and finalized following the detailed engineering design, \nsubmitted to ADB for review, and implemented before civil works begin. \n \n                                                \n38  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39  Relevant environmental and social safeguards provisions will also be included in the bid documents, including the power \npurchase agreement for the associated facilities (i.e., solar photovoltaic plants). \n ", "10 \n27.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Based on a social impact assessment, the project is \nclassified category C for indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities because no indigenous or ethnic \nminority people have been found to be affected by the project. In the project area, less than 0.5% of \nthe total inhabitants belong to an ethnic minority (Cham), and they have been integrated into \nmainstream society. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n28.  The overall project\u2019s risk is low. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.40 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nEDC has no experience  ADB\u2019s OPPP is providing transaction advisory services to EDC.
