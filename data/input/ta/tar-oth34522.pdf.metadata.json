INTRODUCTION\n1. In  June  1999,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  regional  technical\nassistance (TA) to establish the Asia Recovery Information Center (ARIC), funded by a grant\nfrom  the  Government  of  Australia.1  The  objective  of  the  TA  was  to  provide  a  web-based\nclearinghouse for the consolidation, dissemination, analysis, and exchange of timely information\non (i) social and economic impacts of the Asian crisis and recovery; (ii) development assistance\nand domestic policies and programs in response to the crisis, including those in relation to\nsocial safety nets; (iii) emerging assistance needs identified by the affected countries or aid\nagencies; and (iv) public, private, and nongovernment sector expertise that could be utilized in\naddressing specific crisis-related issues. ARIC\u2019s coverage includes the five countries most\naffected by the Asian crisis: Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand.\nThe TA was expected to play an important role in fighting poverty, which had increased in these\ncountries in the wake of the Asian crisis.\n2. The second meeting of the ARIC Advisory Committee, chaired jointly by ADB and the\nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  with  representatives  from  the\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), International Monetary Fund (IMF), United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), and World Bank, was held on 28 September 2000.\nThe  major  agreements  reached  in  terms  of  the  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation\narrangements for the second phase of the ARIC TA are reflected in this TA paper.2 The TA\nframework is attached as Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The Sydney Meeting on Development Cooperation: Responding to the Asia Crisis in\nMarch 1999 organized by the Australian Government concluded that although a large volume of\ninformation on the Asian crisis and recovery was already available, its quality, in terms of\ntimeliness, reliability, consistency, coverage, and accessibility, was questionable, and that there\nwas substantial scope for improvement. It proposed that an Internet-based information facility,\nARIC, be established to facilitate the collaborative exchange of information on and analysis of\nthe Asian crisis and recovery. The Australian Government subsequently requested ADB to\nhouse ARIC. The ARIC TA was approved by ADB in June 1999. The web site was launched in\nearly November 1999.\n4. The ARIC web site was developed in an incremental manner. It currently comprises\neight major sections: Recovery Watch, ARIC Policy Forum, Social Dimensions, International\nAssistance, Country Focus, ARIC Indicators, Meetings & Conferences, and Key Hyperlinks.\nWith the exception of ARIC Indicators, most of these sections provide information in the form of\nexternal links to articles, reports, research papers, official documents, press releases, web\npages, or web addresses obtained from the Internet. The external links are supplemented by\ninformation generated internally. These are occasional overviews and surveys of key aspects of\nthe Asian crisis and recovery prepared by the web team and Regional Economic Monitoring Unit\n(REMU) staff, Economics and Development Resource Center Briefing Notes, and materials\nprovided by AusAID. These sections have been updated on a weekly or fortnightly basis.\n                  \n1  TA 5848-REG: Establishment of the Asia Recovery Information Center, for $1,000,000, approved on 16 June 1999.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 2000.", "2\n5. The ARIC Indicators section provides economic, financial, and social indicators of the\nfive affected countries.  These cover macroeconomic performance, monetary and fiscal policies,\nfinancial  markets,  banking  and  corporate  sectors,  capital  flows,  external  trade,  and  social\ndevelopment. Although annual data are also provided, the focus of this section is on high\nfrequency indicators essential for economic monitoring. The ARIC indicators are compiled using\nraw data obtained mainly from the web sites of official sources such as IMF, central banks,\nministries of finance, and national statistical offices of the countries concerned. This section has\nbeen updated on a weekly basis.\n6. In addition to the eight major sections, the ARIC web site has seven special pages.\nThese  are  Editorials/Opinion,  Daily  Market  Briefs,  Recovery  News  Headlines,  New  Data\nReleased,  International  Assistance  Highlights,  Special  Reports,  and  Asia  Recovery  Report\n(ARR).  The  Editorials/Opinion  page  provides  links  to  selected  newspaper  and  economics/\nbusiness magazine editorials/opinion pieces on issues concerning Asia\u2019s recovery.  It also posts\narticles on topical subjects written by ADB staff. Daily Market Briefs tracks movements in three\nkey financial indicators\u2014exchange rates, stock market indices, and overnight interest rates\u2014of\nthe countries covered by ARIC. Recovery News Headlines provides links to selected local and\ninternational newspapers on significant news relating to Asia\u2019s recovery. New Data Released\nprovides access to official releases of key economic statistics that are later incorporated into the\nARIC Indicators section. International Assistance Highlights monitors recent assistance efforts\nof international aid agencies and multilateral development and financial institutions. Special\nReports is designed to highlight significant reports on Asia's recovery. The ARR is an on-line\npublication on the Asian recovery by REMU.  Most of these pages are updated on a daily basis.\nThe ARR is published twice a year, and supplemented by occasional updates.\n7. Since its launch in November 1999, the ARIC web site has been recognized as a leading\nportal of information and analysis on the Asian crisis and recovery, as evidenced by user\nstatistics and external awards and citations it has earned. Hits now number around 500-600 per\nday. The user profile reflects a wide geographic coverage, including, within the region, Australia;\nHong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; New Zealand; Philippines;\nSingapore;  Thailand;  and  outside  the  region,  the  United  States,  United  Kingdom,  France,\nGermany, Canada, Netherlands, and Italy. The Scout Report3 (February 2000) cited the ARIC\nweb site as \u201ctruly invaluable to users following the Asian crisis.\u201d Forbes magazine rated ARIC as\none of the \u201cBest of the Web\u201d in its summer 2000 issue. The World Bank introduced ARIC in its\nInterest Bearing Notes Newsletter in May 2000. The Asia Observer4 featured the ARIC as a\n\u201cSite of the Week\u201d at the end of May 2000. The Far Eastern Economic Review (10 August 2000)\ncited ARIC as \u201ca good source of updates on Asia\u2019s recovering economies.\u201d During recent ARIC\ndissemination  seminars  in  Indonesia  and  Thailand,5  many  participants  from  concerned\ngovernment offices (ministries of finance, central banks, debt restructuring agencies) and aid\nagencies (World Bank, IMF, UNDP) indicated that they have been using the ARIC web site as\nan important resource and effective tool for supporting their work since its launch. The ARR has\nalso been well received. The inaugural issue (March 2000) and May 2000 Update have been\ndownloaded over 35,000 times. The October 2000 issue was downloaded over 10,000 times\nwithin four weeks after its release, and its total number of downloads reached 22,000 by the end\nof January 2001. The inaugural issue and October issue were released at press conferences\nattended by major news agencies in the region. Both issues received extensive news coverage.\n                  \n3 The Scout Report is a weekly publication by the Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nIt offers a selection of new and newly discovered Internet resources of interest to researchers and educators.\n4 Asia Observer is a web site of news and development in East and Southeast Asia.\n5 The dissemination seminars were organized by REMU with the assistance of the ADB Resident Mission in\nIndonesia and Extended Mission to Thailand.", "3\nWithin ADB, economic and social monitoring facilitated by ARIC is considered to be contributing\ndirectly to ADB\u2019s overarching poverty reduction objective.\n8. Although recovery in the affected countries has been faster than expected, it is still\nincomplete. Because the pace of recovery differs across countries, continuing ARIC\u2019s original\nmandate remains an important goal. In addition, policymakers are now increasingly turning their\nattention to medium-term issues of economic management and development: Can the current\neconomic recovery be sustained and evolve into a new era of high growth? How can crises\nsimilar to the one in 1997 be prevented in the future, and how should capital account crises be\nmanaged  should  they  occur?  How  should  Asian  countries  respond  to  globalization  more\neffectively, and what are the policy priorities? How can the process of poverty reduction in Asia\nbe accelerated and development assistance programs made more effective? Some countries,\nalthough less affected by the crisis, may also be vulnerable to destabilizing shocks. Some other\ncountries have played and will continue to play an important role in facilitating and sustaining\nthe  region\u2019s  recovery.  Reliable  and  timely  information  on  economic  performance,  financial\nsoundness,  and  social  development  in  these  countries  is  also  needed  to  assist  them  in\nmanaging their economies and reducing individual country as well as regional vulnerability.\nThese suggest that ARIC has a larger role to play.\n9. To address these emerging needs, the ARIC Phase II TA will (i) enhance ARIC\u2019s policy\nand knowledge bank activities, with a view to facilitating Asia\u2019s transition from recovery to a new\nera of high growth and dynamism; and (ii) expand coverage to the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC), Singapore, and Viet Nam.\n10. The  longer  term  vision  for  ARIC  beyond  the  second  phase  is  to  develop  it  into  a\nknowledge  portal  on  Asia\u2019s  development  focusing  on  high  frequency  monitoring  of\nmacroeconomic and financial vulnerability, as well as broad development issues and policies. It\ncould  also  be  a  platform  where  policymakers/advisers  of  concerned  developing  member\ncountries  (DMCs),  development  partners,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  civil\nsociety, and other users can interact and share experiences on the unfinished postcrisis reform\nagenda, consider Asia\u2019s development directions in the light of global social and economic\nchanges, and identify the essential development cooperation tasks. During ARIC Phase II,\nalternative arrangements of funding and managing the ARIC operations beyond its second\nphase will be explored, including cofinancing by other assistance agencies.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n11. The objectives of the TA are to continue and consolidate the ARIC activities in Phase I\nand implement new activities, taking into account the faster than expected recovery in Asia. As\nits core activities, the ARIC will continue to (i) monitor the social and economic impacts of the\nAsian  crisis  and  the  recovery  process;  (ii)  provide  information  on  the  responses  of  the\ninternational community, concerned governments, NGOs, and civil society-at-large to the crisis\nand recovery; and (iii) monitor and contribute to ongoing discussions on the postcrisis policy\nagenda.  The targeted web site users will continue to be government officials at various levels in\nthe countries covered by the TA, and other DMCs, aid agencies, private sector users, NGOs,\neconomic policy analysts, academic researchers, and journalists. To address emerging needs,\nARIC will enhance its policy and knowledge bank activities, and expand coverage to more\nDMCs.", "4\nB. Scope\n12. The TA comprises three components: (i) maintenance and consolidation of the existing\nARIC web site; (ii) preparation of the ARR; and (iii) expansion of coverage to other DMCs.\n13. One of the eight existing sections, ARIC Indicators, will be strengthened. This section\nwill be reorganized and new indicators developed to offer better monitoring of macroeconomic\nand financial sector vulnerability. In particular, indicators for monitoring capital flows, aggregated\nmicroprudential indicators for monitoring financial sector vulnerability, and social indicators on\nthe web site are currently relatively weak, and will either be improved or developed in the\nsecond phase. The consolidation will also include redesigning part of or the entire ARIC web\nsite architecture to meet emerging needs and improve the web site\u2019s navigation and operational\nefficiency.6\n14. Two editions of the ARR will be produced during TA implementation. The ARR will\ncontinue to provide analyses of developments in and prospects of asset markets and the real,\nfinancial, monetary, fiscal, external, and social sectors of the countries covered under the TA,\non the basis of high frequency ARIC indicators.\n15. In  addition  to  the  five  affected  countries,  namely,  Indonesia,  Republic  of  Korea,\nMalaysia, Philippines and Thailand, ARIC coverage will be extended to the PRC, Singapore,\nand Viet Nam, as they may be considered as either vulnerable to possible destabilizing shocks\nor important in helping to sustain the regional recovery. Extending ARIC coverage to the PRC\nand Viet Nam aims to help reduce vulnerability of the concerned countries as well as the region.\n16. To maximize the impact of this TA, dissemination seminars will be organized in countries\ncovered by ARIC to increase the awareness for and promote the use of the ARIC web site.\n17. The TA will support the second phase of ARIC for one year. The feasibility of turning\nARIC into a more permanent knowledge portal on Asia\u2019s development for the dissemination of\ninformation and knowledge on economic and social development in the region in the longer\nterm, including its funding arrangements, will be considered and an option paper prepared for\nconsideration by the ARIC Advisory Committee in August or September 2001.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n18. The total cost of the TA will be $930,000. A detailed cost breakdown is provided in\nAppendix 2. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Australian Government. The grant\nwill  cover  the  cost  of  remuneration,  travel,  and  per  diem  for  international  and  domestic\nconsultants, computer hardware and software, accessories, supplies and communication, and\noperation and maintenance of ARIC. All equipment will be purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.\n                  \n6 The current ARIC web site was developed in an incremental manner. Many new sections have been added to the\noriginal  site,  which  was  launched  only  three  months  after  the  project  commenced.  The  web  development\nconsultants have advised that the web site\u2019s architecture may be redesigned to improve its navigation and\noperational efficiency.", "5\nB.  Implementation Arrangements\n19. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  REMU will implement the TA and in doing\nso  will  collaborate  closely  with  other  concerned  ADB  departments  and  offices.  REMU  will\nexplore ways to collaborate closely with the Statistics and Data Systems Division on improving\nthe ARIC indicators system. The ARIC Advisory Committee, consisting of representatives from\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Secretariat, ASEAN Secretariat, AusAID, ADB, IMF,\nUNDP,  and  World  Bank,  will  continue  to  provide  overall  policy  direction.  The  advisory\ncommittee,  chaired  jointly  by  ADB  and  AusAID  representatives,  will  meet  in  August  or\nSeptember 2001 to review ARIC performance and discuss its operations and development\noptions after Phase II.\n20. The TA will require approximately 15 person-months of international consulting services,\nand 114 person-months of domestic consulting services provided by individual consultants. In\naddition, the TA will require a number of technical assistants on an as-needed basis. All the\nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements acceptable to ADB in the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline\nterms of reference for consultants are given in Appendix 3.\n21. One international consultant will be designated as team leader. Under the supervision of\nADB staff, this consultant will oversee the activities of other consultants in developing and\nmaintaining the ARIC web site. The other international consultants, under the supervision of\nADB staff, will help draft specific chapters of the ARR and improve the ARIC Indicators system.\n22. Under  the  oversight  of  the  team  leader  and  ADB  staff,  domestic  consultants\n(economists, statisticians, economist analysts, part-time web editors, and web programmers)\nwill assist in operating the ARIC.\n23. The TA is expected to be implemented over 12 months from April 2001 to March 2002.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n24. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB\nadministering technical assistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $930,000, to\nbe financed by the Government of Australia on a grant basis, for the purpose of the Asia\nRecovery Information Center, Phase II, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nMonitoring Assumptions and\nDesign Summary Performance Targets\nMechanisms Risks\n1.
