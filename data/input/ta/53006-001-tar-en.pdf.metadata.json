INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) supporting the development of a resilient and well-functioning money \nmarket and macroprudential policy framework. The proposed TA will assist the Monetary Policy \nDepartment of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM). The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2019\u20132021.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Weak monetary policy transmission mechanism. The absence of a resilient and well-\nfunctioning money market impairs the effectiveness of the monetary policy framework. Because \nthe banking sector is highly concentrated with a limited product set, monetary policy transmission \nto financial markets using the interbank rate as a reference is weak. Although the BOM has taken \nseveral policy actions to stimulate the interbank money market, it remains underdeveloped both \nas a monetary policy transmission channel and as a mechanism to balance liquidity and funding \nneeds across banks. The BOM is successful in steering interbank rates close to the policy rate, \nbut commercial banks\u2019 deposit and lending rates do not always follow the changes. The shallow \nmoney market, combined with an under-developed primary and secondary debt market, also (i) \ninhibits the development of a complete and reliable yield curve to be used for full development of \ncapital markets in Mongolia and (ii) creates an information gap and asymmetry in price discovery, \nleading to market inefficiency and no reliable benchmark. There is an over-reliance on BOM \nliquidity facilities. Banks heavily rely on BOM facilities for liquidity management rather than taking \na more active approach to rebalance liquidity and funding needs among themselves in the market. \nWhile this is caused by the lack of a well-functioning money market, the ease of availability of \nBOM facilities as a first choice also impairs overall development.  \n \n3.  Underdeveloped  money  market.  The  money  market  is  highly  concentrated  and \ndominated by a few commercial banks. More than 57% of the market share of the interbank \nmoney market by transaction volume in 2018 is concentrated among only three banks. Market \nbreadth is limited, with transactions primarily focused on an unsecured over-the-counter basis. \nThe market is shallow and short-term, increasing market volatility as banks trade with each other \nmainly overnight. The average tenor of interbank transactions was 6.3 days in 2017 and 10.4 \ndays and 2018. According to the BOM, overnight transactions in 2018 accounted for almost 33% \nof total interbank transaction frequency. While economic growth and credit volume has expanded \nsince the 2016 economic and financial crisis, there has been no improvement in the linkage \nbetween official BOM monetary policy decisions regarding the base rate and credit issuance \nvolume of banks. The base interest rate had a 1.0 percentage point cut in early 2018, which \nfollowed  a  2.0-point  cut  in  2017.  Subsequently,  in  response  to  mounting  pressure  on  the \nexchange rate, the BOM hiked the base rate by 1.0 percentage point in November 2018, but the \nimpact on bank commercial rates was nominal and the change in overall credit growth was \nessentially uncorrelated. This evidence supports concerns about the effectiveness of (i) interest \nrates as the key monetary policy tool and (ii) the money market as a key policy transmission \nmechanism.  \n \n4.  The finance sector needs to expand the scope of money market instruments. Secured \ninstruments exist in the interbank market, with banks usually performing \u201crepos\u201d (repurchase \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2019\u20132021. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 September 2019. \n ", "2 \nagreements), but not for more than an overnight basis. The main security for repos is central bank \nbills. Instruments such as repos and reverse repos are now governed only under a domestic \nmaster agreement that BOM developed in 2014. A global master repurchase agreement is not in \nplace. The infrastructure supporting the interbank money market lacks development. Trade \ncommunication among banks is generally via phone. No interbank matching system managed by \nthe BOM exists. Further, there is no framework to effectively regulate practices in the money \nmarket. No market conduct supervision system exists. A framework is needed to oversee market \ndevelopment and practices. A well-functioning money market will (i) aid the conduct of monetary \npolicy through market-based instruments; (ii) provide an anchor for the short end of the yield curve; \n(iii) support the development of the foreign exchange market; (iv) provide the BOM with better \nsignals of market expectations; (v) allow banks and customers to better manage their liquidity \nneeds; (vi)  strengthen financial  intermediation; (vii)  promote  private  issuance  of  negotiable \ncertificates  of  deposits,  promissory  notes,  and  commercial  paper;  and  (viii)  support  the \ndevelopment of the corporate bond market. ADB has assisted the BOM in efforts to enhance \ndevelopment of the money market and monetary policy transmission. Work focused on defining \nkey policy issues in economic management and proposing solutions, including the process for \nmonetary policy committee meetings and assistance in restructuring the BOM\u2019s domestic markets \nand foreign exchange departments. Generally, structural improvements were to include: (i) \nenhancements to the legal and institutional arrangements for improved monetary and foreign \nexchange policy within the law of the BOM; (ii) solutions to improve processes that help formulate \nmonetary policy, including data and statistical analysis and forecasting techniques; (iii) assessing \nmonetary policy transmission mechanisms; (iv) enhancements to the functioning of the monetary \npolicy  committee  and  restructuring  the  Monetary  Policy  Department;  and  (v)  exploring  the \npotential benefits of hedging on the macro-economy, particularly for the prices of meat and \nlivestock.  While  these  efforts  were  sound,  the  BOM  needs  better  analytical  capacity  and \nmechanisms to support direct money market development.  \n \n5.  Ineffective macroprudential policy. A well-articulated framework for macroprudential \npolicy does not exist. Mechanisms must be in place to measure and manage overall financial \nsystem risks and to improve resilience to shocks. The BOM\u2019s macroprudential analysis and \nsystemic risk assessment capacity is weak. While the BOM\u2019s mandate is to ensure financial \nstability, it lacks a full scope of tools and measures to conduct an effective, forward-looking \nmacroprudential policy.  \n \n6.  Narrow capacity and analytical tools to perform risk assessments. The BOM needs \nto expand analytical tools to assess risk scenarios and improve its capacity to use these tools to \nidentify and monitor vulnerabilities within the financial system. Although not yet fully developed, a \ntop-down,  macro  stress  test  would  serve  as  the  first  step  to  establishing  a  more  holistic, \nmacroprudential analytical framework at the BOM. The BOM needs to (i) expand stress testing to \nenhance analytical capacity and forward-looking policy decision-making, (ii) develop satellite \nmodels on banks\u2019 balance sheets and profit and loss, and (iii) model credit risk of households and \nthe corporate sector to fine tune macro model effects.  \n \n7.  A highly interconnected financial system. Mongolia\u2019s financial and economic cycles \nare linked heavily to its mining industry and external conditions and are therefore vulnerable to \nswings in global commodity prices. This concentration can result in situations where a financial \ncycle decline coincides with a real economic cycle recession, thus amplifying the adverse impacts \non the economy. In these cases, monetary policy alone is not enough to resolve the situation. \nThe BOM  lacks macroprudential policy measures that can reduce procyclicality and protect the \nfinancial system from risks and vulnerabilities. In a small economy like Mongolia, traditional \nmonetary policy cannot easily contain financial and economic cycle risks. Actions to contain these \n ", "3 \nrisks require more targeted prudential intervention that acts more directly to constrain excessive \ncredit and leverage as well as manage overexposure to aggregate shocks, such as changes in \nexchange rates and asset prices. Because of the high degree of interconnectedness within the \nfinancial system and between banks, businesses, and the mining sector, it is important to prepare \nadequate systemic risk monitoring and macroprudential tools.  \n \n8.  Limited available policy measures. A broad range of macroprudential policy measures \ndoes not exist. At present, only a series of early warning indicators and a limited range of policy \ncontrols  are  available.  These  measures  include  a  60%  debt  service  to  income  limit  on \nconsumption loans and a capital adequacy 150% risk weight on loans denominated in a foreign \ncurrency. These are all isolated measures and a comprehensive framework that incorporates all \nmacroprudential measures and tools on a consolidated basis is absent. Mongolia has made some \nprogress  on  enhancing  the  financial  stability  oversight  mechanism,  within  the  context  of \nmacroprudential policy, through support of ADB TA and lending programs.2 The law that governs \nthe operation of the Financial Stability Council was amended to clarify its mandate and authority \nand expand its membership to include the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Mongolia. The law \nexpanded the capacity of the council\u2019s secretariat and financial stability coordinators domiciled in \nthe  Financial  Regulatory  Commission  and  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  BOM  revised  the \nresponsibilities, capacity, and structure of the secretariat and staff and developed a road map to \nenhance operations and facilitate collaboration. The BOM designed basic analytical capabilities \nand tools to assess policy proposals, communicated recommendations on using alternative \nmodels to assess financial stability policy decisions and augmented quantitative and qualitative \nanalyses produced by the secretariat. While the BOM made enhancements, they must complete \npreparation of a model to assess policy impacts and financial system vulnerabilities and adopt a \nbroader range of policy measures. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: a stable, sustainable, and balanced finance \nsector  promoted. 3  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  policies  for  supporting  the \ndevelopment of a resilient and well-functioning money market strengthened. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  The TA will help establish an analytical framework for macroprudential policy and help \ndevelop the money market as a more effective transmission mechanism for monetary policy \nthrough two outputs. This TA will draw upon existing, completed TA work supporting financial \nsector  development  and  stability, government plans for  market  development,  and  strategic \nknowledge products and research networking (footnotes 2 and 3). \n \n11.  Output 1: Policy recommendations to expand efficiency and liquidity of the money \nmarket proposed. The TA will prepare an assessment of the status and condition of the money \nmarket in Mongolia. The analysis will evaluate the state of the elements needed to build a well-\nfunctioning money market in Mongolia, including the: (i) capacity and structure of the supporting \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2016.

The TA will produce a money market development agenda to \nhelp guide the BOM and other stakeholders with specific recommendations to enhance the \nefficiency and liquidity of the money market. The TA will identify (i) infrastructure and instrument \nand policy recommendations, among other elements, based on international best practices most \napplicable to Mongolia\u2019s stage of development and (ii) measures that the BOM can enact to \nencourage more participation in the money market. The BOM will establish a working group \nsupported by the TA and financial sector stakeholders to formulate the introduction of the global \nmaster  repurchase  agreement  to  facilitate  market-making  and  hedging.  This  agreement  is \nexpected to increase market-making and allow hedging of capital market instruments. The TA will \nhold workshops to bring financial market participants together to discuss needed enhancements \nto the money market. The TA will hold training for BOM staff on developing money markets.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Draft framework for macroprudential policy proposed. The TA will produce \nan  assessment  and  recommendations  that  outline  the  international  best  practices  of \nmacroprudential policy frameworks and the options to build a forward-looking macroprudential \npolicy to monitor and track the banking sector\u2019s financial soundness in Mongolia. The assessment \nwill identify macroeconomic factors, among other elements, that influence financial institutional \nperformance in Mongolia. Because of the high degree of interconnectedness within the financial \nsystem  and  between  banks  and  the  enterprise  sector,  it  is  important  to  use  adequate \nmacroprudential tools. The TA will prepare a top-down macro stress testing program and base \nmodel, with functional model codes, for macroprudential policy analysis and forecasting. The \nframework  proposal  will  consider  identifying  and  modeling  the  factors  that  affect  banking \ninstitutions\u2019 profitability to enable the BOM to evaluate a broad range of market risks and analyze \nthe impact of macroprudential measures such as loan-to-value ratios, debt-service-to-income \nratios for household loans, and capital adequacy risk weights. The TA will evaluate the cyclical or \ntime-varying components of systemic risk and propose recommendations for mitigations, because \nthese evaluations involve analyzing the gradual build-up of risks in a financial system. The TA will \nconsider the mechanisms and tools needed to assess, signal, and mitigate concerns from volatile \nfinancial cycles, credit booms, and leveraged asset price bubbles. The tools will factor baseline \nand adverse macroeconomic shock scenarios into the tools and consider the structural aspects \nof systemic risk. The risk from the interconnectedness of the banking system in Mongolia must \nbe captured and modeled, among other elements, to consider the liquidity risk arising from \ncontagion and spillovers from one institution to another and onto the entire financial system. The \nTA will hold capacity-building training for BOM staff on implementing a new and expanded \nmacroprudential framework. The TA will support a study tour by BOM officials to an ADB member \ncountry with advanced experience in macroprudential policy assessment and frameworks for the \nofficials to see, firsthand, practices that can be applied most appropriately to Mongolia.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $430,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \naccess  to  needed  data  and  printed  documents,  facilities  for  key  meetings  between  the \n ", "5 \nimplementing agency and consultants, printing and distribution of project materials to staff, \nassistance in coordinating meetings, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The executing agency is the BOM. The implementing agency is the \nMonetary Policy Department of the BOM. The implementing agency will assign staff to a working \ngroup to support the project by jointly evaluating the existing conditions in Mongolia, organizing \noutreach discussions workshops, and formulating final applicable recommendations. The TA will \nrequire two international consultants for 10 person-months total and one national consultant for 6 \nperson-months, contracted through a firm on the basis of a simplified technical proposal. One \nnational consultant (4 person-months) will be individually selected and engaged by ADB under \ntime-based contract. The firm and national consultant will have provisions for fixed out-of-pocket \nexpenditures. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate the firm and consultants and provide staff \nto act as the resource persons in the workshop and conferences if needed.
