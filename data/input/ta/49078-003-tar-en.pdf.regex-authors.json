Seismic Safety Improvement Program (SSIP), first results-based lending program (RBL \nprogram) in Armenia was approved on 22 September 2015 with an amount of $88.5 million. The \nRBL program supports the implementation of the National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction1 \nby (i) improving school seismic safety to reduce casualties and damage in schools during \nearthquakes, and (ii) enabling better use of school buildings as shelters for the general public and \nas focal points for emergency response after earthquakes. SSIP is part of a wider government \nprogram to strengthen schools that are seismically vulnerable. The outcome of the Program is \nimproved coverage of seismically safe school buildings through increased number of students \nstudying in school buildings meeting the safety standards for MSK 9(IX) scale earthquakes by 5.3 \npercentage points from the baseline. The four results areas of SSIP include: i) increasing seismic \nresilience of school buildings; ii) strengthening seismic disaster preparedness and response \ncapacity; iii) improving supportive policies and systems for seismic disaster risk management and \nreduction; and iv) enhancing national capacity in executing and implementing the seismic safety \ninvestment programs. SSIP will reconstruct or retrofit at least 46 priority school buildings. The \nloan closing date was originally envisaged on 31 May 2021 but has since been extended to 31 \nMay 2024 due to start up delays and government\u2019s budget consolidation.  \n \n2.  A knowledge and support technical assistance (KSTA)2 for $800,000 was approved to \nsupport the implementation of SSIP. The KSTA has helped to build capacity during the first three \nyears of the implementation and after two extensions it is scheduled to close on 30 September \n2019. As of 30 October 2018, cumulative disbursements from the TA is $418,227. As of 30 \nSeptember 2018, the RBL program reached 34% of the lapsed time, 12% physical progress, and \n9.3% financial progress. The first advance payment of $21.95 million was disbursed in December \n2015. Based on the achieved disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) an additional $3.8 million was \ndisbursed in December 2016. As of 30 September 2018, cumulative spending by the IA from the \nloan special account is $6.4 million. The executing agency (EA) is the Ministry of Territorial \nAdministration and Development (MTAD) and the implementing agency (IA) is the Armenian \nTerritorial Development Fund (ATDF).  \n \n3.  The verification protocol of SSIP requires that the construction completion report of \nschools shall be validated by an internationally accredited third party in terms of its compliance \nwith the MSK9 (IX) scale earthquake safety requirements. Validation of the constructed and \nretrofitted schools by the accredited third party is an important condition for disbursement of the \nSSIP funds, and endorsement of the detailed design of schools is a key technical milestone. The \nGovernment  of  Armenia  has  requested  ADB to  provide  continuous  support to  design  and \nconstruction of SSIP schools and to cover the costs of validations using TA resources. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The transaction TA (TRTA) will help the EA and IA develop the capacity to implement the \nSSIP and to validate the achievements of DLI targets. The TRTA will have two components: i) \nengineering support for design and reconstruction/retrofitting of program schools, and ii) validation \nof selected DLIs. The first component is justified by the specialized nature of skills required for \nbuilding schools with targeted seismic intensity and lack of local engineering and construction \n                                                \n1 Government of Republic of Armenia. 2012. National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction. Yerevan. \n2 The KSTA was attached to SSIP and was approved on 22 September 2015.  \n ", "2 \ncapacity. Given the nature of RBL for completed building correction of defects will be irreversible \nand impossible. The support will be provided after 30 September 2019, the extended date of the \nongoing KSTA. The second component is justified given the limited budget availability for the \nprogram because of the government\u2019s budget consolidation. Validation activities financed from \nADB TA will help to ensure independent validation and to avoid the risks of delay associated with \nthe government\u2019s fiscal constraints.  \n \n5.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan (COBP) 2019\u20132021 for \napproval in 2018.  \n   \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Quality of Design and Construction Verified and Improved. The activity will \nstrengthen quality of design and construction of seismic resilient schools. While the detailed \ndesign will be financed by the loan, it needs to be verified by the consultant to meet the targeted \nstandards. Considering the weak local capacity, this would be important to comply with SSIP \nrequirements and avoid failure in validation. Consultant\u2019s periodic visits to the construction sites \nwill be conducted to inspect the quality of works. The support will be extended throughout SSIP \nimplementation with relatively heavy inputs during the first-three years of implementation, and \nfewer inputs closer to completion.   \n \n7.  Output 2: About 46 schools with school buildings meeting the safety standards in \nArmenia for MSK 9 (IX) scale earthquake validated. The output will focus on validation of \ncompleted schools through field visits and reviews of design and construction documents and \nreports. A methodology and framework of construction validation will be developed at an early \nstage. The validation will be conducted throughout SSIP implementation.      \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $50,000 is the value of \nthe government's in-kind contribution. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n9.  Eligible  expenditures  include  (i)  consultant  services  for  capacity  building,  and  (ii) \nconsultant services for validation of selected SSIP DLIs.  \n \n10.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, domestic \nland transportation, per diem of national consultants, office space and office supplies, laboratory \nanalysis costs, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA. The Armenia Resident Mission of CWRD will select, supervise \nand evaluate consultants. The Ministry of Territorial Administration and Development will be the \nexecuting agency. The TRTA will be implemented from December 2018 to December 2023.  \n \n12.

Under the ongoing KSTA (through quality and cost-based selection) a consulting \nservices contract amounting $773,250 for program implementation support was signed with IRD \nEngineering S.R.L. on 13 May 2016. The consultant\u2019s activities include program management \nsupport, engineering support for design and construction of seismically safe buildings, and update \nof supportive policies and systems for seismic disaster risk management and reduction. Using \nsavings under the KSTA the contract amount was subsequently increased to $800,000, and the \ncontract completion date and KSTA completion date were extended to 31 July 2019 and 30 \nSeptember 2019, respectively. The consultant\u2019s support to the IA and EA is assessed  as \nsatisfactory. For smooth implementation of SSIP and transfer of knowledge for improving the \nsupportive policies and systems, direct contracting under the new TRTA after completion of the \nongoing KSTA is essential. The single-source selection method will be appropriate for this \ncomponent.

Introduction  \n1.   The Seismic Safety Improvement Program (SSIP) is the ADB loan to Armenia designed \nusing results-based lending (RBL) modality. The $88.5 million program aims to increase the \nnumber of students studying in school buildings meeting the safety standards for MSK 9(IX) scale \nearthquakes by 5.3 percentage points from the baseline.  The program has four results areas. \nResults area 1: Increasing seismic resilience of school buildings. The program will support \nthe strengthening or reconstruction of at least 46 priority school buildings identified by the \nGovernment.  The strengthened or reconstructed school buildings will meet the internationally \naccepted seismic safety standards for an earthquake of Medvedev-Sponheuer- Karnik (MSK) \nscale IX. Results area 2: Strengthening seismic disaster preparedness and response \ncapacity.  An  emergency  response  action  plan  will  be  developed  for each  school  building \nstrengthened or reconstructed under the program and will further raise the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 \nawareness on seismic risks and to guide them in properly responding and evacuating in the event \nof earthquakes. Results area 3: Improving supportive policies and systems for seismic \ndisaster risk management and reduction. The program will support (a) the review and update \nof the country\u2019s building codes for schools so they are harmonized with international standards \nfor seismic safety, (b) development of guidelines for school building strengthening and retrofitting \nin line with international best practices, (c) consolidate and update of the governments broader \nprogram for school strengthening and reconstruction (SSRP), and (d) update of the probabilistic \nseismic  hazard  map.  Results  area  4:  Enhancing  national  capacity  in  executing  and \nimplementing the seismic safety investment programs. The program will strengthen the \nArmenian Territorial Development Fund (ATDF) for effective implementation of the program.  \n \n2.  Based  on  the  four  results  areas  disbursement  linked  indicators  (DLIs)  have  been \ndeveloped. Disbursements under the program are linked to successful achievement of DLIs. The \nprogram documents are accessible from the following URL4. Program DLIs and DLI verification \nprotocol  are  in  Attachment  1.  Validation  of  the  constructed  and  retrofitted  schools  by  the \naccredited  third  party  is  an  important  condition  for  disbursement  of  the  SSIP  funds,  and \nendorsement of the detailed design of schools, is a key technical milestone. \n \n3.  The executing agency (EA) is the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Development \n(MTAD) and the implementing agency (IA) is the Armenian Territorial Development Fund (ATDF). \nThe program completion is scheduled for 30 November 2023. \n \n4.   ADB will provide to the Government of Armenia a technical assistance (TA) grant to support \neffective implementation of SSIP. With two consulting packages the TA will: i) support for \nimproving supportive policies and systems for seismic disaster risk reduction, and support for \ndesigning and constructing school buildings with targeted seismic intensity (Package 1), and ii) \nconduct independent validation of DLI achievement (Package 2). \n \nB.
