INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Azerbaijan (the Government) requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  the \nDepartment of Antimonopoly Policy (DAP) of the Ministry of Economic Development (MED), \nAzeri competition regulator, and to develop a competition policy framework appropriate for all \neconomic sectors. In response, ADB fielded a mission to Baku, on 6-14 February 2003. The \nmission reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, terms of \nreference, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1 The TA \nframework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The structure of the Azeri economy is heavily affected by the dominant role of the energy \nsector.2  The  skewed  economic  structure  is  the  major  anomaly  in  the  Azeri  economy  and \ndevelopment of the nonenergy sectors remains the country's main challenge. Manufacturing is very \nundeveloped, providing just 5% of gross domestic product, far below the share of that in oil \nproducing countries and central asian republics. Although Azerbaijan\u2019s overall economic policy is \nfairly liberal, significant barriers impede the development of a sound, transparent, and competitive \nbusiness environment. Despite heavy inflows of oil-related foreign direct investment, Azerbaijan \nremains fundamentally unattractive to foreign investors. A recent study by the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) ranks Azerbaijan 121st in foreign direct \ninvestment potential, measured by the structural determinants of the economy\u2019s long-term \ncapacity to attract foreign investment.  As for corruption, Transparency International\u2019s 2003 \nreport3 ranks Azerbaijan 95th out of 102 countries considered. In most of the economy, included \nthe service and the agriculture sectors, few participants control large shares of the markets. Private \nand public anticompetitive practices, like collusion, violations of consumer rights, and the abuse of \ndominant positions, are widespread in the Azeri economy.  \n \n3.  Competition policy issues are primarily regulated under four main laws: the Antimonopoly \nLaw, the Law on Protection of Consumer Rights, the Law on Unfair Competition, and the Law on \nNatural Monopolies. These laws address all sectors, including financial services. Besides, wt o \nother laws deal specifically with competition issues within the financial sector: the Law on \nFinancial Industrial Groups, adopted in 1996, and a commercial banking law that is about to be \napproved and contains a provision to deal with antitrust activities and ownership concentration. \nThe  new  law  prohibits  banks  from  entering  into  agreements  and  carrying  out  concerted \noperations  to  monopolize  banking  services  and  limit  competition  in  the  banking  industry. \nCompliance with regulations against monopolization of banking activity will be controlled by the \ncentral bank, which will mean a second, separate competition agency for the banking sector. \n  \n4.  Recently, the responsibility for enforcing all competition policy laws was placed with DAP \nwithin the MED. DAP is at its initial stage of development and its goal is to become a modern \nregulatory body following modern standards for competition and related policies. The main \nfunctions of DAP include implementing measures to promote competition, preventing of both \nunfair  competition  and  abuse  by  firms  with  dominant  market  positions,  and  protecting  of \nconsumer rights. DAP has a staff of only 21 people. One of the primary instruments through \nwhich  DAP  implements  competition  policy  is  its  Register  of  Monopoly  Enterprises;  Azeri \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in February 2003. \n2  In 2001, oil and gas represented one third of the Azerbaijan\u2019s gross domestic product, up from 10% in 1997; oil's share of \ntotal exports rose to 90% in 2001 from 58% in 1997. \n3 Transparency International. 2003. Global Corruption Report. Available: http://www.globalcorruption.org   ", "2 \nenterprises that are deemed dominant\u2014defined as having a market share of at least 35%\u2014are \nlisted on this register and must declare to DAP their prices and profits for approval.  \n \n5.  DAP and its predecessor have a limited record of interventions to enforce the competition \nlaws. A few investigations have taken place, following the simple rules set out by the law, but the \nfindings have not included recommending any cases for prosecution. Thus, there has been no \nreal enforcement of the competition laws in Azerbaijan, and DAP has insufficient independence, \nadministrative and technical skills, human and financial resources, and analytical capabilities to \ncope with the daunting tasks of applying the competition rules and intervening to effectively help \na transition economy become a modern market economy.  \n \n6.  Several factors and institutional limitations have prevented the effective implementation \nof legislation. Consolidation of monopolies and oligopolies has been fostered by indirect forms \nof protectionism; Azerbaijan\u2019s overall policy is fairly liberal, but poorly implemented with huge \nmargins for discretion often exploited by vested interests, creating fertile ground for corruption. \nIncomplete and inconsistent legislation and regulation are also an issue. For instance, DAP \ncannot initiate investigations on its own; its actions must be requested by an entity whose \nlegitimate interests are being damaged. Further, the authorities don\u2019t have the power to ensure \nfirms adopt their decisions and have not yet developed a clear approach to dealing with \nmergers, etc. DAP's administrative capacity is inadequate and it lacks basic information on the \nmarket structures and the behavior of firms. For Azerbaijan, which is still transforming and \nopening  its  economy  to  foreign  competition,  the  optimal  firm  size  is  still  unknown  and \ninstitutional capabilities and statistical information have to be developed further before market \nstructure can be analyzed properly. Due to the constraints, DAP has not yet devoted significant \ntime, or resources to promote an understanding of the benefits of competition in Azerbaijan.  \n \n7.  The  lack  of  understanding  about  competition  issues  when  framing  other  laws  and \nregulations, and when as well as deciding public policy actions, has resulted in inconsistencies \nbetween policies and in the economy, affecting issues such as market entry conditions, exit \npolicies, trade measures (e.g. tariff and nontariff barriers), definition and regulation of natural \nmonopolies, etc. For example, high import duties on goods that are not produced in Azerbaijan \nneed to be addressed especially for goods that are crucial inputs for sectors with high export \npotential.  \n \n8.  Considerable development of Azerbaijan's competition framework is needed before it will \nbecome an effective instrument to enhance market access for new competitors, protect markets \nfrom  restrictive  business  practices,  and  foster  economic  efficiency  and  consumer  welfare. \nDetermination and implementation of competition policy in Azerbaijan still depends heavily on \nindividuals rather than on institutions. DAP does not yet have the autonomy, skills, culture, and \nresources to achieve its objectives and is still struggling to define its role within the Azeri business \ncommunity, civil society, and government institutions. The overall current institutional framework \nshould be assessed to determine whether competition issues should be addressed at the sector \nlevel or economywide, and whether DAP\u2019s present set-up as a department within MED allows \nDAP to function properly. \n \n9.  The efficiency and the future prospects of the Azeri economy will be significantly affected \nby  the  willingness  and  ability  of  authorities  overseeing  competition  to  establish  a  sound \ngovernance  environment  and  to  enforce  effective  competition  policies.  MED  intends  to \nreorganize and to strengthen DAP, and the needed political will seems to be in place to start \nmodernizing and strengthening the Azeri competition policy framework. Thus, the proposed TA \nis timely and the Government has received no other assistance on this matter.  ", "    3 \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of DAP and create a legal and \nregulatory framework for supporting a healthy policy environment for competition in all sectors. \nA well-designed policy framework and an effective competition authority will be instrumental in \nfostering an environment conducive to economic efficiency, consumer welfare, and investment \nand  business  activities  in  Azerbaijan.  In  particular,  and  in  line  with  Government\u2019s request, \nspecial attention will be paid to the regulation of natural monopolies and to the prevention of \ncartels. The TA is in line with the strategic objective of ADB's assistance to promote good \ngovernance in Azerbaijan.  \n \n11.  The expected main outputs of the TA are \n \n(i)  identification  of  a  strategy  to  improve  DAP's  effectiveness  and  institutional \ncapacity, and \n(ii)  identification of legal amendments and institutional and policy actions allowing \nDAP to become an effective regulatory authority following modern standards for \ncompetition and related policies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will \n \n(i)  analyze the main impediments to a modern competition policy framework in \nAzerbaijan;  \n(ii)  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  present  institutional  arrangements  to  deal  with \ncompetition issues, discuss the possible institutional solutions appropriate for a \ntransition economy, and provide recommendations to support the strengthening of \nthe institutional framework in competition policy; \n(iii)  review  the  legal  framework  regulating  competition  and  related  policies  and \nrecommend legal measures to strengthen the laws and regulations and their \nimplementation; \n(iv)  draft amendments of the legal framework to regulate natural monopolies and \ncartels and to prevent unfair competition;  \n(v)  assess the political autonomy, administrative and analytical capacity, adequacy \nof financial and human resources, and availability of the relevant statistical and \neconomic information for DAP to deal with competition policy issues in all of the \neconomy; \n(vi)  identify key areas where training is needed to improve the effectiveness and \ninstitutional capacity of DAP, and provide training for DAP staff; and \n(vii)  organize a conference, open to the public, with relevant decision makers and \nwith participants from other countries competition authorities, to disseminate the \nfindings  of  the  analyses,  discuss  key  policy  and  legal  issues,  promote \nacceptance of the need for competition, and activate relationships with foreign \ncompetition and antitrust authorities. \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $320,000 equivalent, comprising $224,000 in foreign \nexchange and $96,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $26,000 equivalent of the local currency costs.  The TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining  $70,000  equivalent  for  remuneration  and  per  diem  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, and contingencies. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are provided in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MED will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MED will provide office accommodation for \nthe consultants (suitably furnished and with access to communication facilities), counterpart \nstaff, and venue and facilities for workshops and training activities. ADB will review and monitor \nthe implementation of the TA through missions and consultants\u2019 reports.  \n \n15.  A  team  of  four  individual  consultants,  two  international  and  two  domestic,  will  be \nassembled by ADB to implement the TA, for a total of 14 person-months (outline terms of \nreference  are  included  in  Appendix  3).    The  two  international  consultants  will  include  a \ncompetition policy expert (4 person-months) and a legal and economic competition expert \n(4 person-months).  The  domestic  consultants  will  have  had  legal  experience  and  will  be \nengaged for 6 person-months. The consultants will be selected and recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The team leader will submit (i) an inception report (inclusive \nof terms of reference for the domestic consultants) 3 weeks after commencement of their services; \n(ii) draft final report before the conclusion of the contract; and (iv) final report 3 weeks after \nincorporating comments from the MED and ADB. The TA is expected to commence in September \n2003 and to be completed in September 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Azerbaijan for Development of a Competition Policy Framework, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nCreate an environment  Satisfactory legal and  Asian  Political and \nconducive to economic  regulatory policy  Development  macroeconomic \nefficiency, consumer welfare,  framework introduced.
