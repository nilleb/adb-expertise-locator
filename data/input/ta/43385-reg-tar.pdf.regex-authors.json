INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to helping its developing member \ncountries (DMCs) ensure that all of their people have access to clean, modern energy. This goal \nis in line with the objectives of inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth under ADB\u2019s \ncurrent long-term strategic framework, Strategy 2020.1 It also reflects the three operational \npillars of ADB\u2019s updated Energy Policy,2 which aim to promote energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy, maximize the availability of energy for all, and support energy sector reforms along with \ncapacity  building  and  governance.  Many  of  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  have  ambitious  plans  to  greatly \nincrease  the  delivery  of  energy  to  their  citizens,  including,  in  some  cases,  universal \nelectrification programs.  \n \n2.  The proposed regional project preparatory technical assistance (TA) builds on work \nunder ADB\u2019s Energy for All Initiative,3 which was launched in 2008 and has developed new \napproaches  and  methodologies for  expanding  access  to  energy  for  the  poor. The  TA  will \npromote strategic approaches and partnerships to develop and implement larger projects and \nprograms than ADB has supported in the past to make clean energy more available using \nmodern efficient technologies. These undertakings will be oriented toward the poor. The vice-\npresident of knowledge management and sustainable development approved concept clearance \nof the TA on 9 October 2009. 4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Access to modern and reliable energy services is essential for sustainable development. \nModern energy powers more than just economic growth. It also transforms lives by providing \nbetter delivery of education and health services, a cleaner and healthier environment, and \nimproved opportunities for women and girls. Numerous studies have shown that access to \nmodern energy enhances progress toward all of the Millennium Development Goals. Improving \naccess to cleaner, renewable sources of energy also strengthens energy security in DMCs and \nis a key to mitigating climate change. \n \n4.  From 1990 to 2009, ADB provided over $25.8 billion in assistance for energy projects, \nextending electricity and modern fuels to hundreds of millions of people in Asia and the Pacific. \nMost of this support went to large power generation and grid extension projects, however, and \nthe energy needs of many of the urban and rural poor remain unmet. More than 800 million of \nthe region\u2019s people still have no access to basic electricity services. Nearly 1.8 billion still cook \nand heat by burning wood, charcoal, dung and other forms of biomass. Women and children, \nespecially  girls,  work  countless  hours  to  collect  these  traditional  energy  fuels  and  suffer \ndisproportionately from the pollution damage indoor cooking fires inflicts on the health of millions. \nThis widespread energy poverty is hindering progress toward sustainable, inclusive growth.  \n \n5.  The DMCs face great obstacles in their efforts to achieve universal access to modern \nenergy.  Extending  power  grids  to  remote  populations  with  low  volumes  of  electricity \nconsumption  is  often  not  technically  or  financially  feasible.  Lack  of  financing  is  a  major \nimpediment. Much evidence show that poor households are willing to pay for energy services \nbut, without access to credit, cannot afford the cost of connecting to the grid or purchasing off-\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2008, Technical Assistance for Energy for All Initiative. Manila (TA 6443-REG, approved on 6 February, with \nfunding of $2.3 million from the Government of the Netherlands). \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 November 2009. \n ", "2   \ngrid energy services prohibitive for many. Longstanding regulations and incentives in some \nDMCs promote business-as-usual practices by subsidizing grid extension and fossil fuels such \nas diesel and kerosene without offering similar incentives for these off-grid applications that \ncould rapidly expand energy access. \n \n6.  Innovations and cost reductions have made distributed renewable energy technologies \nattractive  for  off-grid  lighting  and  electricity  generation  and  many  DMCs  have  adopted \nregulations to encourage distributed generation. ADB has supported its DMCs in promoting off-\ngrid applications where grid extension was not feasible and has backed initiatives to promote \ncleaner, more efficient cooking technologies. These projects have been successful at a small \nscale. Due to the widely distributed nature of these projects, the high program costs, and the \nintensive capacity building required, however, the challenge has been to develop much larger, \nbankable projects.  \n \n7.  ADB undertook the Energy for All Initiative to begin this transformation from small one-\noff projects to larger programs with more beneficiaries and greater impact. The results have \nbeen positive. In its first 2 years of implementation, ADB\u2019s investment in access to energy rose \nto nearly $900 million, 50% more than the total for the previous 5 years.5 The initiative has \nhelped ADB introduce new approaches to the task. For example, it supported the design of \ncredit facilities that give poor households loans to finance investments in energy services. The \nEnergy for All Initiative supported the establishment of the Energy for All Partnership in June \n2009,6 which brings stakeholders from the private sector, financial institutions, governments, \nand  nongovernment  organizations  across  the  region  together  to  collaborate  on  what  is  a \nregional challenge through knowledge management, capacity building, and project development. \nThe partnership\u2019s working groups address key geographic, thematic, and technological issues \nand provide a platform for stakeholders to help develop and finance projects that will provide \naccess to energy to 100 million more people in the region by 2015.   \n \n8.  Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience in access-to-energy projects have highlighted (i) \nthe  importance  of  end-user  financing  for  achieving  rapid  scaling  up  of  off-grid  energy \napplications and the continued need to unlock local bank financing and microfinance to enable \npoor households to access energy services, especially in rural areas; (ii) the need for regional \ncooperation to facilitate transfer of knowledge and technologies; and (iii) the need for new \nbusiness models that will attract greater private sector participation and reduce dependency on \ndonor financing and subsidies. ADB has also learned that great scope exists for promoting off-\ngrid energy access through its non-energy divisions, such as agriculture and natural resources \nand finance, and that the capacity must be built within these non-energy divisions to develop \nprojects that contribute to increasing access to energy while continuing to achieve their distinct \nsector goals. \n \n9.  The proposed TA will build on ADB's earlier support for new approaches under the \nEnergy for All Initiative by (i) meeting the growing demand among operations departments, \nincluding from non-energy divisions, for support in developing more and larger projects to give \nthe poor access to energy; (ii) meeting the strong demand from DMCs for help to increase the \nuse of clean technologies that satisfy the energy needs of the poor and bolster energy security; \nand (iii) ensuring the crucial support necessary to ensure the relevance and impact of the \nEnergy for All Partnership through its establishment phase and to help it attract more partners \nand resources.  \n                                                 \n5  Investment calculations based on ADB. 2010.

The  TA\u2019s  impact  will  be  improved  economic,  environmental,  gender,  and  health \nconditions for the poor in participating DMCs. The TA outcome will be an increased number of \nprojects that will give the poor access to modern, reliable, clean energy services.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will increase the number of ADB projects that deliver access to energy to the \npoor and raise ADB\u2019s overall investment in access to energy through a combination of support \nto ADB\u2019s operations departments, capacity building among DMC governments and other key \nstakeholders,  and  support  for  the  Energy  for  All  Partnership.  It  will  comprise  several  key \nactivities: \n \n(i)  The TA will help operations departments consolidate and replicate successful \nmodels for providing access to energy to poor communities and will facilitate the \nadoption and adaptation of these models throughout the region. The TA will work \nclosely with energy and non-energy divisions to identify opportunities to develop \naccess-to-energy  projects  or  project  components  early  in  the  project \ndevelopment pipeline. This will support operations departments to develop more, \nand larger-scale, projects based on existing models that aggregate demand, \nespecially through financial intermediation. The approaches promoted will include \noff-grid renewable energy technologies, such as small solar photovoltaic, hydro, \nand wind installations for lighting and electricity generation, as well as cleaner, \nmore efficient cooking and heating applications like improved cookstoves and the \nuse of biogas from livestock manure. The TA will promote the involvement of \nfinancial institutions and the private sector in delivering access to electricity for \nthe poor through public\u2013private partnerships, fee-for-service models, and end-\nuser financing.  \n \n(ii)  The TA will help selected DMCs analyze options for making access to electricity \nuniversal, a first step in the development of project pipelines for future ADB \nassistance.  \n \n(iii)  The capacity of governments, the private sector, financial institutions, and civil \nsociety in participating DMCS will be expanded under the TA so that they can \ndesign and implement effective policies, programs, and projects to make cleaner \nrenewable energy technologies available to the poor.  \n \n(iv)  The TA will also support the development large pro-poor energy access projects \nthrough the Energy for All Partnership by providing seed funding to the regional \nsecretariat and working groups to establish a pipeline for financing by ADB, other \ndevelopment partners, and the private sector. The partnership offers high value \nto ADB because it provides (a) strong links to the private sector and opportunities \nto  help  mobilize  private  sector  resources  in  access  to  energy;  (b)  improved \nknowledge management on access to energy and related poverty alleviation, \ngender, and human development issues; and (c) an external signal of ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to access to energy. During TA implementation, ADB will mobilize \nadditional resources from external sources and will support the establishment of \nthe partnership as an independent legal entity.  \n \n ", "4   \n12.  The TA will be implemented in DMCs where it will have a high impact. Bangladesh, \nBhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal, Pakistan, and the \nPhilippines have been selected based on a number of considerations: the fit with the individual \ncountry  partnership  strategy 7  and  ADB\u2019s  pipeline  of  projects,  interest  from  operations \ndepartments to develop more pro-poor access-to-energy projects, government interest and \ncommitment to increase access to energy to the poor, and current access-to-energy status. \nUsing the same criteria, other countries may be designated during TA implementation. Potential \ninterventions under the TA vary from country to country:  \n \nTable 1: Potential Access to Energy Intervention in DMCs \n \nCountry  Potential Intervention \nBangladesh  Expanding access to piped natural gas among the urban poor, rural electrification \nthrough micro-hydro \n \nBhutan  Biogas development \n \nCambodia  Rural electrification through small wind power \n \nIndonesia  Outer island off-grid rural electrification through solar energy, kerosene to liquefied \npetroleum gas fuel switching for the poor \n \nLao People's Democratic  Biogas development, small wind power development \nRepublic \n \nNepal  Rural energy access through micro-hydro (including improved water mills), small \nwind power development \n \nPakistan  Biogas development \n \nPhilippines  Biogas development, rural electrification through micro-hydro and small wind power \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  The interventions will ultimately be based on (i) local demand and utilization of energy, \n(ii) the renewable energy resources available locally, (iii) the replicability and scalability of a \nparticular intervention in a particular country and within the region, (iv) technical viability, (v) \neconomic viability, (vi) the enabling environment, (vii) the interest shown by communities and \nlocal partners to participate, and (viii) whether other projects to provide access to energy for the \npoor  are  ongoing  or  proposed.  Operations  departments  and  DMC  governments  will  be \nconsulted before final decisions. The initial social and poverty analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The estimated total cost of the TA is equivalent to $2 million. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund8 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility. The cost estimate and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA.

RSID will collaborate closely with energy and non-energy divisions in the \noperations departments, as well as resident missions, in implementing the TA and to ensure \nthat there is no overlap between the resources of this TA and other project preparatory TAs \ndeveloping access-to-energy projects. Each participating DMC will designate an appropriate \nimplementing agency or focal point for the TA. Activities funded by this TA will begin in a \nparticular DMC only after ADB has received written confirmation from the DMC government that \nit has no objection to its inclusion in the TA.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years from 1 May 2010 to 30 April 2013. The TA will \nrequire an estimated 131 person-months of consultant inputs (65 international and 66 national). \nThe engagement of consultants will be phased according to demand for specific expertise. \nRSID will draft detailed terms of reference in consultation with the operations departments for \neach work component. Many of the consultants will be recruited as individuals because of the \nneed  to  source  specialized  and/or  country-specific  expertise.  Individual  consultants  will  be \nengaged through either time-based or lump-sum contracts. A firm will be engaged to carry out \nTA activities in support of the Energy for All Partnership. The firm will be recruited using quality- \nand cost-based selection, or quality-based selection, depending on the value of the contract and \nthe complexity of the assignment. Firms will submit either full or biodata technical proposals and \nwill be awarded either time-based or lump-sum contracts. All consultants will be engaged by \nADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. All procurement of \ngoods and other services under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Upon completion of the TA, all equipment \nprocured by the consultants under the TA will be turned over to ADB. Disbursements under the \nTA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.9  \n \n17.  The TA will bring about an international dialogue in the region on access-to-energy \nissues, plans, and policies. It will disseminate best practices and lessons learned through a \nvariety of tools. These will include training, workshops, technical exchanges, and international \nconferences; publications and multimedia tools, including the websites of ADB, the Energy for \nAll  Partnership,  and  other  partners;  and  the  opportunities  provided  by  the  Energy  for  All \nPartnership  for  the  interaction  of  other  key  stakeholders  and  their  broader  networks.  TA \nconsultants will monitor ADB investment in access to energy and track approved and pipeline \nprojects  to  measure  TA  progress  on  its  goal  of  increasing  the  number  of  these  projects. \nProgress of the Energy for All Partnership will be tracked through a monitoring and evaluation \nsystem that includes quarterly progress reports from the partnership\u2019s working groups and \nsecretariat. A review of the partnership will be conducted midway through the TA period to \ndetermine whether there is continued interest from partners and whether the partnership is \ncontributing to broadening access to energy in the region. It will also determine the next steps \nfor continued ADB support.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n18.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nAsian Clean Energy Fund of the Government of Japan under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility for Empowering the Poor through Increasing Access to Energy. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the project \nwould directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the partner \ncountry. \n \nThe proposed technical assistance (TA) directly supports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) poverty alleviation mandate and the \nfocus under Strategy 2020a  on inclusive growth. It also aligns with ADB's 2009 Energy Policy, which identifies maximizing access \nto energy as one of three pillars for ADB\u2019s overall support to the energy sector. Increasing access to energy also aligns with \ndeveloping member country policies and programs, many of which include ambitious universal electrification targets. \n \nAccess to modern and reliable energy services is essential for sustainable human development, economic growth, higher quality \nof life, and better delivery of education and health services.  \n \nMuch data suggests that poor households spend more on energy\u2014in relative and sometimes even absolute terms \u2013 than their \nwealthier neighbors. The projects implemented with the support of the TA will not only provide cleaner, more efficient energy to \npoor households but may also reduce household energy expenditure. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nNumerous studies have demonstrated the link between access to modern energy and poverty reduction. Access to energy creates \neconomic opportunity for poor households, through lighting and mechanical power, and improves productivity. This is particularly \ntrue for women, who are able to make better use of time formerly spent sourcing fuel and performing manual labor. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory TA/due diligence? \n \nFor all projects that receive support through the TA, ADB staff and consultants engaged through the TA will ensure that the \nsocial and poverty impact assessments of acquired access to energy are appropriately incorporated into the broader due \ndiligence and project design of the respective projects.  \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor governance, \nand pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe projects will explicitly target poor beneficiaries and thus will incorporate pro-poor design elements as appropriate.  \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nPoor households in rural, urban, and remote areas without access to modern energy are the primary beneficiaries of the project. \nWomen in particular will benefit from reduced drudgery, improved income generation opportunities, and improved health. \nChildren, especially girls, will benefit from increased study time and opportunity to attend school. As indigenous peoples often \nlive in remote areas far from electricity grids, they too will be among the primary beneficiaries.  \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nHouseholds reliant on kerosene for lighting or burning biomass for cooking require access to cleaner, more efficient, and often \ncheaper forms of energy. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address them? \n \nThe interventions supported through the TA will be designed so that the poorest households are the primary beneficiaries and to \nensure that benefits are not captured by individuals and households who could access modern energy without project \nassistance. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nPotential stakeholders include affected peoples, affected communities, national, provincial, and local authorities, civil society \ngroups, private sector technology suppliers and service providers, local financial and microfinance institutions, and local \nassociations.  \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation is required during the TA or project processing (e.g., workshops, community \nmobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nAffected  persons  and  communities  and  all  other  relevant  stakeholders  will  be  fully  consulted  during  the  design  and \nimplementation of projects supported through the TA through stakeholder consultations and workshops.  \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nAs this TA will support a number of projects in different developing member countries, consultations will be carried out in \n accordance with the design of each project and relevant national regulations. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program? \n \nWomen and girls suffer disproportionately from inadequate access to modern energy. Women and girls often spend several \nhours a day engaged in subsistence activities like agro-processing, firewood gathering, water pumping, and cooking. Time spent \non these activities deprives women of opportunities for income generation and deprives girls of educational opportunities. In \nhouseholds dependent on biomass and traditional stoves for cooking, women and girls suffer more harmful health impacts from \nindoor air pollution, a condition that kills 1.5 million people worldwide each year.    \n \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making? \n \n      Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nBy improving access to modern energy among the poor, the TA  will promote gender equality by  increasing  women\u2019s \nopportunities for productive work and income generation, by increasing girls\u2019 education prospects, and by reducing the harmful \nhealth impacts from burning kerosene for lighting or burning biomass for cooking. Since this TA aims at supporting projects at \nan early stage and bringing them into ADB's pipeline, gender action plans will be prepared during the processing of such \nprojects, where applicable. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n \n          Yes          No    Please explain  \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nIII.

PROJECT PREPARATORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR DUE DILIGENCE RESOURCE REQUIREMENT \n1.  Do the terms of reference for the TA (or other due diligence) include poverty, social and gender analysis and the relevant \nspecialist(s)?  \n        Yes                    No   If no, please explain why.      \n \nThis TA will support the development of access to energy projects through operations departments. Specialists engaged \nthrough  this  TA  will  provide  inputs  on  the  poverty,  social,  and  gender  analysis  of  the  projects  they  support  but  the \ncomprehensive due diligence will be conducted by the project teams engaged through the operations departments.   \n2.
