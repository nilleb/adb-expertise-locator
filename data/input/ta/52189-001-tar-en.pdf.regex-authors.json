INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will support the knowledge \ncontribution of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the Aid for Trade (AfT) initiative led by the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), including participation in the biennial AfT Global Review. \n \n2.  The TA cluster is included in the Management-approved annual work program for the \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) as a policy research agenda \nfor developing member countries (DMCs) for 2018.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  International trade has been instrumental to rapid economic growth and poverty reduction \nin Asia and the Pacific and will continue to play a key role in meeting the Sustainable Development \nGoals. However, many developing countries, particularly the least developed, face challenges in \nfully benefiting from trade liberalization because of obstacles, such as supply-side capacity and \ntrade-related infrastructure, that constrain engagement in international trade. Moreover, the \nbenefits  of  trade  liberalization  within  countries  are  not  always  shared  equitably  among  all \nsegments of the economy, with micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and women-led firms \ntypically at a disadvantage.2 To fully realize potential trade outcomes for inclusive growth, \ndeveloping countries should focus more on trade liberalization and policy adjustments, as well as \non  the  investments  necessary  to  address  capacity  and  infrastructure  constraints.3 These \nchallenges are exacerbated by DMCs\u2019 lack of understanding of AfT-related issues, including how \nbest to maximize the benefits of AfT to achieve inclusive trade-driven growth. The TA cluster will \naddress this knowledge gap on AfT's key role in helping DMCs address constraints to inclusive \ntrade. \n \n4.  The WTO launched the AfT initiative in 2005 to help recipients maximize the benefits of \ntrade openness by improving trade and productive capacity, infrastructure, and institutions. Since \nthen, AfT has become an increasingly important part of official development assistance (ODA)\u2014\ngrants  and  concessional  loans\u2014targeted  at  trade-related  programs  and  projects. 4  The \ncenterpiece event of the AfT initiative is the AfT Global Review held every 2 years since 2007 at \nthe WTO in Geneva. It brings together stakeholders to take stock of progress and challenges and \nto strengthen monitoring and evaluation to advance the AfT agenda in a coordinated and effective \nmanner. ADB is an important partner of the AfT Global Review; its main contribution consists of \na research report, Aid for Trade in Asia and the Pacific, launched at the AfT Global Review, as \nwell as organization of side events. The report provides an update on AfT trends and patterns in \nAsia and the Pacific. In addition, the report includes in-depth analyses on topical issues related \nto the inclusiveness and sustainability of trade growth, in the context of a biennial work program \napproved and circulated by WTO\u2019s Committee for Trade and Development. This work program \n                                                \n1  The TA cluster first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 November 2018. \n2  N. Mohammed. 2017. Aid for Inclusive Trade and Poverty Reduction. In Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development and WTO. Aid for Trade at a Glance 2017: Promoting Trade, Inclusiveness and Connectivity for \nSustainable Development. Paris: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Publishing / Geneva: \nWTO. \n3  ADB. 2017. Aid for Trade in Asia and the Pacific: Promoting Connectivity for Inclusive Development. Manila. \n4  Footnote 3. Since 2005, AfT disbursements have grown faster than ODA, reaching $32.9 billion in 2015 from a \nbaseline average of $11.8 billion in 2002\u20132005. Asia and the Pacific is the largest AfT recipient, with disbursements \nin 2015 at 38.2% of total $36.3 billion ODA to the region. AfT is also an integral part of ADB support for regional \ncooperation and integration and inclusive development. In 2016, ADB\u2019s AfT commitments reached $2.0 billion, an \nincrease of $1.4 billion over the 2002\u20132005 average, accounting for about 73% of ADB\u2019s total ODA. More than 67% \nof ADB\u2019s AfT targets infrastructure, especially transport and storage, and communications. \n ", "2 \nguides the overall focus of each AfT Global Review in light of emerging trade and development \nissues, hence the need to continuously provide updated knowledge solutions. \n \n5.  While global trade growth further accelerated in 2017, of which Asia has been the key \ndriver, the global economic environment continues to pose challenges.5 As rising protectionist \ntendencies and challenges to the multilateral global trade architecture threaten nascent recovery \nin trade growth, the capacity of AfT measures to produce positive results has become more vital, \nwhich includes building a case on the importance of continued trade liberalization. Empirical \nanalysis indicates that AfT has played an essential role in the region\u2019s positive trade performance \nin goods and services, and in generation of inclusive job opportunities (footnote 3). \n \n6.  Under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, ADB will sustain efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and \nexpand its vision to achieve a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the \nPacific.6 The Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020 identified \nincreased opportunities for cross-border trade and investment among key elements for raising \ncompetitiveness in connected markets, which in turn is essential for generating inclusive and \nsustainable growth.7 ADB will also further strengthen its role as a knowledge provider. Strategy \n2030  underscores  the  value  of  ADB\u2019s  knowledge  and  evidence-based  research  in  raising \nunderstanding and awareness about critical areas and sectors for action; supporting good policies \nand  reforms  by  DMCs;  and  contributing  to  global  development  discussions  by  offering \nperspectives from Asia and the Pacific. Through its contribution to and participation in the global \nreview via knowledge products and events, ADB contributes to better awareness of how AfT can \nplay an effective role in helping DMCs maximize the benefits of trade liberalization in an equitable \nmanner, and leverage trade for inclusive and sustainable growth. \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n7.  ADB has been an active partner of and contributor to the WTO-led AfT Global Review \nsince its inception in 2005. The TA cluster approach is most appropriate, given the 2-year cycle \nof the AfT Global Review. The TA cluster will enable ADB to continue its commitment to the WTO-\nled AfT Global Review without potential interruption, and each cluster can focus on the theme that \nis aligned with the overall theme of the biennial AfT Global Review. The 2-year cycle also allows \nfor in-depth analysis and rigorous peer review in the production of the biennial Aid for Trade in \nAsia and the Pacific report. Under the TA cluster, ADB will support the preparation of the next \nthree Aid for Trade in Asia and the Pacific reports. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n8.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impacts: (i) opportunities for further trade \ngrowth in Asia and the Pacific maximized and (ii) DMCs\u2019 integration into the global economy \n                                                \n5  Global trade volume growth accelerated to 4.7% in 2017 from 1.8% in 2016\u2014surpassing global economic growth for \nthe first time since 2012. Asia contributed about 35% of global volume growth. The region\u2019s trade volume growth \nreached 7.1% in 2017, the highest since 2011, and largely supported the region\u2019s gross domestic product growth. \n6  ADB. 2018.

The plan places \nspecial emphasis on the needs of landlocked and small island economies. An operational plan for 2019\u20132024 is \ncurrently being drafted. \n ", "3 \nheightened through increased trade openness. The TA cluster will have the following outcome: \nDMCs\u2019 understanding of relevant trade opportunities, bottlenecks, and issues improved.8 \n \n9.  Output 1: Aid for Trade in Asia and the Pacific reports published and disseminated. \nTo provide a solid empirical and analytical foundation for the content of Aid for Trade in Asia and \nthe Pacific reports (one report per subproject), the TA cluster will commission background \nresearch papers to supplement research of the Regional Cooperation and Integration Division \n(ERCI) on the selected theme topics. The theme of the seventh AfT Global Review in 2019 is \nSupporting Economic Diversification and Empowerment for Inclusive, Sustainable Development \nthrough Aid for Trade. The report will examine how international trade can promote inclusive \ngrowth and empowerment by (i) actively pursuing the participation of women and the growing \nyouth population in trade-related activities; (ii) facilitating the integration of micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises into regional value chains and global trade; and (iii) promoting inclusive \nindustrial development by broadening trade for the services sector and rural economy. Related \nareas of discussion include the role of digital connectivity, technology, and innovation to widen \nopportunities, improve access to finance, and foster skills development. A section of the report \nwill be devoted to the challenges faced and progress made by the Pacific island economies, \ncompared with other geographically challenged regions. Subsequently, the focus of the 2021 and \n2023 reports will be based on the themes of the eighth and ninth AfT Global Reviews respectively, \nwithin the overarching consideration of how best to leverage trade for inclusive and sustainable \ngrowth. \n \n10.  Output 2: Knowledge sharing events organized. The international launch of the Aid for \nTrade in Asia and the Pacific report during the AfT Global Review will be followed by knowledge \nsharing events cohosted by ADB development partners in Asia and the Pacific. Outreach will \ninclude analytical discussions of the issues in partnership with academic institutions, think tanks, \nand development partners. Distinguished economists and trade experts in the region will be \ninvited to discuss the analytical rigor of the research work. Policy makers and private sector \nrepresentatives will also be invited to the knowledge sharing events to generate discussions on \nthe wider policy relevance. The publications will be widely disseminated in collaboration with \nADB\u2019s Department of Communications and participating resident missions, as well as with \nsubregional programs.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Background  papers  published.  The  background  papers  will  also  be \nconsidered for publication as policy briefs and working papers to provide researchers with more \nextensive analyses related to the themes of the reports. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $750,000 ($250,000 for each TA subproject), of which \n(i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF \n6) and (ii) $250,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia through the \nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade and administered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing arrangements will be presented in each TA subproject proposal submitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. ERCI, ERCD will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants and resource persons; procure goods; organize workshops and conferences; consult \n                                                \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nwith ADB regional and other relevant departments; and provide staff and/or coordinate ADB staff \nfor  supporting  services  and  participation  in  workshops  and  conferences.  For  research \ncollaboration, joint conferences, and dissemination activities, the TA cluster will also partner with \nreputable research institutions in the region or globally. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  January 2019\u2013June 2024 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department \nConsultants  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by \nTrade economists, trade  Individual selection  ADB \nspecialists, aid for trade \nexperts (international) \nEconomic and manuscript  Individual selection  ADB \neditors (international) \nResource persons  Individual selection  ADB \nResearch, economic analysts  Individual selection  ADB \n(national) \nDesktop publishing  Individual selectiona  ADB \nspecialists, graphic designers, \nlayout artists (national) \nManuscript proofreaders  Individual selectiona  ADB \n(national) \nProcurement  Mode of procurement  No. of contracts  Procured by \nRFQ  9  ADB \nDisbursement  Arrangements for disbursement from multiple funding sources (e.g., front-\nloading ADB-administered funds, cost sharing, or pro rata) will be agreed \nwith cofinanciers.

Subprojects. The TA cluster will be implemented through three subprojects (Appendix 2). \nEach subproject will be designed to support the achievement of the cluster outputs (paras. 9\u201311) \nduring the implementation period (Table 2). Each TA subproject proposal will be submitted for \napproval to the ERCD director general, following the business process for knowledge and support \nTA cluster processing.9 Subproject activities will start after approval. \n \nTable 2: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \nBudget \nItem  Subproject Title  Implementation Period  ($\u2019000) \nSubproject 1  Aid for Trade for Inclusive Growth, 2019\u20132020   January 2019\u2013June 2020  250 \nSubproject 2  Aid for Trade for Inclusive Growth, 2020\u20132022  July 2020\u2013June 2022  250 \nSubproject 3  Aid for Trade for Inclusive Growth, 2022\u20132024  July 2022\u2013June 2024  250 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2018.

Individual consultants will be recruited as needed for the duration \nof the TA cluster to provide about 28 person-months of international consulting inputs, including \nresource persons for conferences and other knowledge sharing events; and 138 person-months \nof national consulting inputs. The consultants will be engaged following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.10 Hiring a team of individual consultants will provide more benefits for \nADB than engaging a firm because of the following reasons: (i) faster mobilization of consultants, \n(ii) greater control by the implementing agency in selecting and managing consultants, and (iii) \ngreater flexibility in engaging experts specializing in a broad spectrum of AfT-related topics. \n \n16.  International consultants will be commissioned to prepare background research papers \nfor selected topics in the Aid for Trade in Asia and the Pacific reports and to edit TA-related \npublications and written outputs. National consultants will include research and economic analysts \nwho will assist ADB in the delivery of the TA cluster\u2019s core outputs and in the preparation of the \nTA cluster\u2019s publications and seminars. Other national consultants, including typesetters, graphic \ndesigners, and proofreaders, will be engaged for the publication of AfT and other reports and \npapers. Resource persons, who are internationally distinguished experts and could include ADB \nstaff, will be engaged to present or facilitate discussions at seminars and other events. \n \n17.  A team of ERCI staff comprising two international staff members (one acting as the project \nleader and the leader of the team of consultants), one national officer, one operations coordinator, \nand one operations assistant will oversee and manage the implementation of the TA cluster. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s procurement. Purchases of information and communication technology-related \nequipment and/or supplies and econometric or statistical programs and/or software will follow the \nADB  Procurement  Policy  and  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as \namended from time to time), in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and \nTechnology and Office of Administrative Services, where applicable.11 After the TA cluster is \ncompleted,  any  procured  equipment  will  be  disposed  following  the  Project  Administration \nInstructions on Administering Grant-Financed Technical Assistance.12Disbursements under this \n \nTA cluster will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) administering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $250,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia and \n(ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for Aid \nfor Trade for Inclusive Growth, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n10 ADB will consider lump-sum payments, output-based contracts, and framework agreements or contracts for \nconsulting services. \n11 The procurement plan will be included in each subproject proposal. \n12 ADB. 2018.
