The  Project  will  also  support\ndecentralization of basic education management in the context of the\nadministrative and fiscal decentralization being effected in Indonesia.\nClassification Poverty:   Core poverty intervention\nThematic: Human development\nEnvironmental Category  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\nRationale\nThe National Development Plan (PROPENAS) of the Government\nand the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operational strategy\nprioritize  poverty  reduction  and  regional  equity.  Achieving  and\nsustaining these goals require equitable provision of quality basic\neducation to set a foundation (i) to reduce existing gaps in human\ndevelopment across the country, and (ii) to ensure the availability of\ntrainable  human  resources  to  support  social  and  economic\ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  these  strategic  goals\nthrough (i) focused investment in basic education targeted to poverty-\naffected areas, schools, and children; and (ii) improved management\nand  governance  of  basic  education  through  decentralization,  and\nmeasures for a transparent basic education system, accountable to\ncommunities and civil society.\nObjectives The broad goals of the Project are to contribute to (i) reducing poverty\nand Scope and inequity in human development by supporting the achievement of\nuniversal basic education, and (ii) implementing regional autonomy by\nsupporting  decentralized  management  of  basic  education.  The\nimmediate objectives are (i) to improve poor children\u2019s participation,\ncompletion, and learning outcome from nine years basic education,\n(ii) to develop the capacity of districts to manage decentralized basic\neducation; this includes support to establish school boards and make\nthem operational as well as enhance school committees for greater\ncommunity participation in community or school-based management;\nand (iii) to demonstrate the effectiveness of block grant mechanisms\nto support school, community, and district-based initiatives to improve\nbasic education and enhance school effectiveness.\nCost Estimates\nThe  estimated  Project  cost  is  $125.0  million  equivalent,  of  which\n$30.9 million (25 percent) is the foreign exchange cost and $94.1\nmillion equivalent (75 percent) is the local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan              ($ million)", "iii\nForeign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian 21.1 78.9 100.0 80\nDevelopment Bank\nGovernment 0.0 25.0 25.0 20\nTotal 21.1 103.9 125.0 100.0\nLoan Amount\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  various  currencies\nand Terms\nequivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  77,579,000  from  its  Special\nFunds  resources  (ADF).  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1\npercent per year during the grace period and 1.5 percent per year\nthereafter. ADB will finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost\nof the Project and 73 percent of the local cost. The Government will\nfinance about $25.0 million equivalent in local currency.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2008\nExecuting Agency Ministry  of  National  Education  (MONE).  The  Ministry  of  Religious\nAffairs (MORA) will be co-Executing Agency and will second staff to\nthe central facilitation unit (CFU), provincial project monitoring units\n(PPMU),  and  district  project  management  and  monitoring  units\n(DPMMU) to ensure integration and equitable treatment of madrasah\n(Islamic schools) catering to poor children.\nImplementation\nThe Implementing Agencies will be the district governments of the 21\nArrangements\ndistricts  covered  by  the  Project.  District  project  management  and\nmonitoring units (DPMMU) will be established in each district. The\nDPMMUs will be responsible for day-to-day planning, management,\nand implementation of Project activities.\nProcurement All  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. Each contract for the supply of goods,\nequipment,  and  furniture  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000\nequivalent will be awarded on the basis of international competitive\nbidding  (ICB)  procedures,  while  contract  packages  of  $500,000\nequivalent or less will follow international shopping, local competitive\nbidding (LCB), direct purchase (DP) procedures, or local procedures\nas applicable.\nThe Project will support the rehabilitation of school facilities that do\nnot meet the minimum conditions for learning. It is estimated that the\nProject will support rehabilitation of approximately 1,400 primary and\njunior secondary schools. Considering the small unit costs of civil\nworks (maximum of $12,000 per school), mainly in remote and rural\nsites  with  associated  difficulties  in  material  delivery,  rehabilitation\nworks are unlikely to attract international or domestic contractors and\nsuppliers at the national level. In addition, experience indicates that", "iv\ncommunity-managed rehabilitation ensures greater transparency and\naccountability,  cost-effectiveness  (36  percent  less  costly  than\ncontractor-managed or implemented rehabilitation), stronger sense of\nownership  and  better  facility  maintenance  by  the  communities.\nTherefore,  beneficiary  schools  and  communities  will  procure  civil\nworks for school rehabilitation and school furniture (both labor and\nmaterials) locally through procedures acceptable to ADB.\nThe Project will procure a small amount of office equipment such as\ncomputers for administration and data processing and management,\nand vehicles for the CFU, PPMUs, and DPMMU. Each package is\nestimated to cost less than $50,000 and will be procured under DP\nprocedures showing evidence of limited local tender to obtain the\nmost competitive prices. As districts have slightly different\nrequirements and begin project implementation in phases, equipment\nwill be packaged and procured by district in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.\nThe  Project  will  finance  the  purchase  of  textbooks  and  other\nteaching/learning materials through the School Development Fund\n(SDF) school improvement category.  Actual requirements will be\ndetermined by each school, but will not exceed $6,000 per school.\nSchools will select and purchase textbooks and materials, using DP\nshowing  evidence  of  limited  local  tender  to  obtain  the  most\ncompetitive prices.  The choice of DP was based on lessons from\npast  or  ongoing  projects  indicating  that  consolidated  purchase\nthrough LCB does not result in economy of scale or timely provision\nof textbooks and teaching/learning aids. Delivery of centrally procured\nmaterials by contracted forwarders is not cost-effective or reliable for\nremote  and  rural  schools,  and  school  and  community-managed\npurchase and delivery are more likely to ensure timely and complete\ndelivery.\nConsulting Services Consultants  will  be  required  for:  (i)  district  capacity  building  and\nimplementation support (Package A), and (ii) independent monitoring\nand  evaluation  (Package  B).  Package  A  will  comprise  one\ninternational  consultant  (12  person-months)  and  46  domestic\nconsultants  (1,656  person-months).  Package  B  will  comprise  one\ninternational consultant (24 person-months), 26 domestic consultants\n(456  person-months),  and  about  300  test  administrators.  A  large\nnumber of domestic consultants are required because of the Project\u2019s\nemphasis on capacity building, independent monitoring, and district\nand  school-based  project  implementation.  A  separate  package  of\nmentoring services will be provided under the SDF component. The\nmentoring  services  will  comprise  one  international  consultant  (24\nperson-months), 13 domestic consultants (684 person-months), and\nabout 85 domestic community level mentors to work directly with the\nschools and the communities. The consultants will be selected and\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging\ndomestic consultants. On 21 May 2001, ADB Management approved", "v\nretroactive financing and advance action for recruiting consultants to\npermit their timely fielding for effective project implementation. The\nProject also provides for retroactive financing of eligible expenditures\nincurred  not  earlier  than  9  July  2001  (date  of  the  first  day  of\nappraisal), for a maximum of $2,000,000 equivalent. The Government\nhas been advised that such advance action and the provision for\nretroactive financing do not commit ADB to finance any part of the\nProject.\nEstimated Project 30 June 2008\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits and The Project almost exclusively targets children from poor families.\nBeneficiaries The Project is estimated to benefit a total of 1.26 million primary and\nsecondary school children (ages 7-12 and 13-15 years, respectively)\nin the 21 Project districts.  Of this number, 0.896 million children (71\npercent of the total beneficiaries) are estimated to be from families\nliving below the poverty line. The Project will benefit about 5 percent\nof  all  school-age  children  in  Jakarta,  29  percent  in  Bali,  and  64\npercent in NTB.  Beneficiary children in Jakarta will consist largely of\nthose  residing  in  slum  areas.    Beneficiary  children  in  Bali  are\npredominantly in the northern districts with a high concentration of\npoor tenant farming and fishing communities.\nBy  targeting  poor  children  and  using  poverty  indicators  in  the\nselection criteria for beneficiary schools, the Project is expected to\ngenerate direct benefits for children from below the poverty line and\nlow-income  families  in  two  ways:  (i)  the  children  will  have\nopportunities to obtain and complete primary and junior secondary\neducation  by  having  access  to  scholarships,  school  fee  waivers,\ntutorials,  and  other  support;  and  (ii)  their  completion  of  junior\nsecondary education will improve their marketability in the job market\nor give them opportunities to continue their formal education. At least\n50 percent of the beneficiaries of the scholarship and other school aid\nprograms will be children from families below the poverty line. Net\nenrollment and completion rates will increase among  the  children\nfrom families below the poverty line.  Benefit evaluation studies during\nthe  fourth  and  seventh  years  of  project  implementation  will  allow\nmonitoring of increased primary school completion, transition to junior\nsecondary schools, junior secondary school completion, labor market\nabsorption or entry into higher education.\nThe Project will improve the beneficiary schools\u2019 ability  to  deliver\nbasic education, and meet the needs of low-income and poor families\nfor  quality  education  through  better  on-site  targeting  and  direct\nparent-school communication. The indicators for such improvements\ninclude (i) attendance of communities in participatory processes to be\nsupported in the school based management (SBM) subcomponent;\n(ii) budget allocations for scholarships and other school aid from the\nSDF  subcomponent  to  beneficiary  schools;  (iii)  scores  reflecting", "vi\nschool efficiency and quality of education services; and (iv) reduced\nrepetition and dropout rates among students.\nPreliminary estimates during Project preparation indicate that about\n3,000 schools clustered in poor communities in 17 districts will qualify\nfor assistance through the SDF subcomponent, and an additional\n115,000 children from poor households in all 21 districts will receive\nsupport through the social equity program under the district education\ndevelopment  fund  (DEDF)  subcomponent.  Target  schools  serve\nabout 56-78 percent of students from poor families. Methodologically,\nmore accurate projections are not possible as the as specific project\nsites and beneficiary schools can only be determined during Project\nimplementation, on the basis of thorough socioeconomic surveys to\naccurately capture the geographic distribution and concentration of\npoverty. Nevertheless, the special support for poor children and the\ntargeting criteria for beneficiary school selection will ensure that the\nProject covers children from households below the poverty line and\nthat at least 50 percent of the total beneficiaries of scholarships and\nother support will come from poor families. Children from low-income\nbut non-poor families will also be eligible to receive special assistance\nif they are otherwise unable to attend school. In this manner, the\nProject is designed to address poverty using income as well as non\nincome aspects of social deprivation among families with school-age\nchildren. Through this broader interpretation of social deprivation, the\nProject  will  also  contribute  to  the  national  objective  of  providing\nuniversal access to basic education.\nProject Risks The Project risks are largely attributable to the combination of the\ndecentralized implementation arrangements and intended targeting of\npoverty-affected areas. The key risks are (i) decentralized Project\nimplementation context; (ii) challenges exacerbated by the Project\u2019s\nattempts to reach the poorest communities and schools, which are\noften  remote  and  hard  to  reach;  and  (iii)  heavy  involvement  of\nconsultants.\nIn  the  context  of  the  decentralization  laws,  the  Project  will  be\nimplemented by local (district) governments. Most of the districts have\nsome degree of experience in implementing investment projects in\nthe  social  sectors  financed  by  either  ADB  or  the  World  Bank.\nNevertheless, each district government is at the developmental stage,\nand  a  series  of  system,  organizational,  and  staff  changes  are\nanticipated during the course of Project implementation. In addition,\nvariations are expected in the organizational structure and systems in\neach  district,  including  their  relationships  with  the  provincial  and\nnational governments. To safeguard against risks associated with the\nnewly decentralized administrative context, the Project (i) integrates a\nmajor capacity-building component; (ii) emphasizes direct resource\ntransfer to, and involvement of, schools and communities, the stable\ndelivery point of basic education services; and (iii) employs a process", "vii\noriented design to maintain maximum flexibility and adaptability to\nevolving circumstances. Implementation will take longer than usual,\nanticipating slow start-up and low disbursement during the first few\nyears. Districts will begin implementation in phases. Undue pressure\non fast disbursement during the first years would undermine the need\nto build sufficient and accountable project implementation capacity.\nThe Project targets poor areas that are often remote, difficult to reach,\nand where the capacity of the schools and communities is limited.\nThe building capacity  of schools and communities is a prerequisite\nbefore development activities and resource flows start. Such capacity\nbuilding in difficult-to-reach areas will require on-site and ongoing\ntechnical support that is not threatening to local communities. The\nProject plans to engage a large number of community-worker type\nconsultants  that  can  be  best  provided  through  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs).\nWhile on-going projects have had positive results, use of NGOs and\nCBOs is not yet a common practice in Indonesia.  Similarly, capacity-\nbuilding  support  that  must  take  place  at  the  district  level  and\nrequirements for independent monitors and auditors will involve a\nlarge number of consultants. General experience to date in Indonesia\nindicates  that  the  Government  needs  considerable  lead  time  to\nengage loan-financed consultants; this may take even longer if the\nProject requires new types of service providers. To minimize the risk\nof implementation becoming consultant-led and to ensure localization\nof  Project  experience,  (i)  the  Project  will  primarily  use  domestic\nconsultants  associated  with  a  minimum  number  of  international\nconsultants,  and  (ii)  mentors  for  SBM  and  decentralization/\nimplementation  support  consultants  will  pair  off  with  government\ncounterpart teams.  To ensure timely engagement, ADB management\nhas endorsed advance action and retroactive financing for consulting\nservices.", "v\niii", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Decentralized Basic Education Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In 1997, the Government of Indonesia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to\nsupport the improvement of basic education in the provinces of Bali and Nusa Tenggara Barat\n(NTB) and the Special Capital Region (DKI) Jakarta. The Government selected these places\nconsidering  gaps  in  basic  education  provision  in  those  areas  as  well  as  the  regional\ndemarcation between ADB and the World Bank.1 ADB approved (1998) a small-scale project\npreparatory technical assistance (TA),2 but project preparation was suspended to prioritize\ntimely responses to the economic crisis and to observe political and administrative changes that\nfollowed the crisis. In 2000, the Government and ADB agreed to resume project preparation.\nThe Government requested that the Decentralized Basic Education Project (DBEP) support the\nprocess of decentralizing basic education management, in the context of Law 22/1999 on\nRegional Governance and Law 25/1999 on Fiscal Decentralization. The Government further\nrequested  that  the  DBEP  build  on  accomplishments  of  the  ADB-funded  crisis  response\nprogram, the Social Protection Sector Development Program (SPSDP).3 Subsequently, ADB\napproved a small-scale TA4 to redesign the DBEP to suit the new context. This report is based\non the findings of the Loan Appraisal Mission5 conducted during 6-26 July 2001 and earlier ADB\nmissions,  consultation  with  project  beneficiaries,  reports  prepared  by  the  TA  consultants,\ndiscussions  with  the  central  and  local  governments,  and  discussions  with  international\nassistance agencies. The project framework is given in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Socioeconomic Context\n3. Indonesia has experienced considerable upheaval in recent years, and the processes of\npolitical and economic transformation are still ongoing. The country is ethnically diverse, and the\ndistribution of poverty is uneven. Natural resources, climate, and local cultures vary widely\namong the regions, as does the potential for economic growth and poverty reduction.\n4. Prior to the economic crisis, the annual growth of the gross domestic product (GDP)\nexceeded 7 percent for over two decades.6 Indonesia made substantial progress in human\ndevelopment  as  the  Government  expanded  and  improved  basic  social  services  and\n                                                          \n1 The World Bank is supporting basic education projects in the provinces of Sumatra, West Java, East Java, Central\nJava, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi, and is also preparing a new basic education project\ncovering South and West Sumatra and East Java.\n2 TA 3007-INO: Basic Education in Bali and Nusa Tengara Barat Project, for $150,000, approved on 16 April 1998.\n3 Loan 1622-INO: Social Protection Sector Development Program, for $100 million; and Loan 1623-INO: Social\nProtection Sector Development Project, for $200 million, approved on 9 July 1998.\n4 TA 3456-INO: Preparation of Decentralized Basic Education Project, for $150,000, approved on 14 June 2000.\n5 The Mission comprised I. Matsumoto, Senior Education Specialist/Mission Leader; C. Gregory, Senior Project\nSpecialist; S. Chowdhury, Senior Programs Officer; K. Emzita, Counsel; S. Handayani, Social Development\nSpecialist, and A. Inagaki, Education Specialist. Fiscal decentralization and implications on the local budget were\nexamined during loan fact-finding by N. Usui, Economist. The Appraisal mission was assisted by F. Munger,\nCapacity Building Specialist/Staff Consultant; J. Wood, Teacher Development Specialist/Staff Consultant; and S.\nKataoka, Financial Analyst/Staff Consultant.\n6 ADB 2001, Indonesia: Country Assistance Strategy, March.", "2\ninfrastructure.  Education,  health,  family  planning,  and  nutrition  indicators  improved,  as  did\naccess to water and sanitation services. However, notable regional variations remain in the\nproportion and absolute number of the poor. The economic crisis severely affected Indonesia,\nand eroded the social and economic development gains achieved since the mid-1970s. Poverty\nincidence rose to 24.2 percent, a nearly 50 percent increase from 1996 to 1998. While the crisis\nhit  urban  areas  the  hardest  (the  urban  poverty  rate  increased  by  60  percent),  the\ninterdependence of urban and rural economies also brought a rise in poverty in the rural areas\n(where the poverty rate increased by 30 percent).7 The crisis hit the delivery of social services,\nincluding basic education. Government expenditure on education declined in real terms. School\nincomes fell considerably, as many parents had to delay or stop paying fees.\n5. The national output data at the end of 1999 confirmed the recovery of the Indonesian\neconomy  from  the  crisis,  and  this  trend  continued  through  2001.  The  recent  official\nmeasurement of poverty indicated that transient poverty triggered by the crisis began to reverse\nby mid-1999, along with a slow rise in nominal wages and price deflation, particularly of rice.\nThe poverty rate has returned to near pre-crisis levels of 18.2 percent (15.1 percent urban and\n20.2 percent rural). Nevertheless, following the crisis, the depth of poverty, i.e., the average\namount of income required to raise the poor above the poverty line, increased in all provinces.\nThe intensity or severity of poverty also increased. This meant an increase in the proportion of\nthe ultra poor. At the broadest level, the pattern of the geographic distribution of poverty in\nIndonesia has been one of steady improvement across most of the country, with the exception\nof the eastern part, including NTB.\n2.  Basic Education\n6. The education system in Indonesia consists of preschool, primary education (grades 1 to\n6), junior secondary education (grades 7-9), senior secondary education (grades 10-12), and\ntertiary education (Appendix 2). Basic education covers nine years of compulsory primary and\njunior secondary education. The success of the Government\u2019s supply-side approach to the\neducation sector\u2019s development resulted in rapid growth in the number of primary schools since\nthe 1970s. This success brought about a fast rise in primary net enrollment rate (NER)8 from 60\npercent in 1971 to 92.6 percent in 1999,9 although NER rates vary depending on the data\nsource. In 1994, Indonesia established a goal to achieve universal nine-year basic education by\n2003.10 The junior secondary NER improved considerably between 1993 and 1999, from 46.7\npercent  to  54.8  percent,11  and  did  not  decline  during  the  crisis,  indicating  the  positive\ncontribution of the scholarship and block grants programs accompanied by extensive social\nmarketing to prevent dropouts that ADB initiated during the crisis (SPSDP).\n7. Private schools enroll 41 percent of students at the junior secondary level. All public and\nprivate  primary  and  junior  secondary  schools  share  a  common  core  curriculum  known  as\nCurriculum 1994.12 The size and diversity of the clientele strains the basic education system,\n                                                          \n7 ADB 2000, Poverty Assessment in Indonesia, October.\n8 The primary net enrollment rate (NER) refers to the percentage of students 7-12 years old enrolled in primary\nschools against the total school-age population (7-12 years); junior secondary NER concerns children 13-15 years\nold. The data was drawn from the National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS).\n9 SUSENAS, 1999.\n10 The Government has deferred the target year to 2010, considering the effects of the crisis on the government\nbudget.\n11Ministry of National Education, Jakarta 2000.

Prior  to  the  economic  crisis,  education  expenditures  in  Indonesia  rose  steadily  but\nremained relatively low compared with those of neighboring countries. Education expenditures\n(1995-1997)  averaged  2.3  percent  of  GDP  and  12.3  percent  of  the  total  Government\nexpenditures (Appendix 3). During the same period, the Government expenditures on primary\nand junior secondary education rose by 33 and 44 percent, respectively. The expenditures\nincluded subsidies to private primary and junior secondary schools (e.g., provision of teachers\nand administrators). During the crisis, education expenditures declined to 8.5 percent of total\nGovernment expenditures (1998), recovering slightly to 9.6 percent of Government expenditure\nin 1999. Education expenditures as a percentage of GDP dropped from 2.1 percent (1997) to\n1.7 percent (1998), then rose slightly to 1.9 percent (1999). The share of basic education\nexpenditures in the total Government expenditures decreased during the crisis from 8.4 percent\n(1995) to 5.9 percent (1998). Yet, intrasectoral allocation to basic education within education\nexpenditures  was  well  protected,  and  the  share  of  basic  education  in  total  education\nexpenditure increased from 67.6 percent (1995) to 71.5 percent (1999).13 This attests to a\npositive effect of the financial support and the policy framework agreed upon through the\nSPSDP.\n9.  Effective January 2001, management and financing of basic education14 were devolved\nto  district  governments.  Prior  to  decentralization,  basic  education  was  managed  centrally\nthrough complex and compartmentalized structures in three ministries: Ministry of National\nEducation  (MONE),  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs,  (MORA),  and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs\n(MOHA). MONE was responsible for overall planning, coordination, and regulation for education\nat all levels, and directly administered and financed public junior secondary education. MOHA\nadministered and delivered public primary education (teacher management, establishment and\nmaintenance of primary schools, and provision of subsidies to private primary schools). MORA\nadministered and financed public primary and junior secondary madrasah (Islamic school), and\nsupervised and provided financial assistance to private madrasah. This three-ministry system\nwas replicated at provincial and district levels where each ministry was represented in parallel\nby local offices. Paralleling this complex management structure, basic education budgeting and\nfinancing involved five ministries: MONE, MORA, MOHA, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the\nNational Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), with a mix of financing arrangements\nand funds sources for each type and level of school.\n10. With decentralization, district governments became responsible for planning, financing,\nmanaging,  and  delivering  basic  education.  Their  responsibilities  also  cover  school  staff\nappointment,  transfer,  and  school  location  planning.  The  central  Government  establishes\npolicies,  the  national  curriculum,  a  national  examination/assessment  system;  and  sets\nstandards for (i) achievement at each age; (ii) learning materials; (iii) acceptance, transfer, and\ncertification of students; and (iv) learning time for basic education and fixing the educational\ncalendar.  The  central  Government  sets  standards  and  procedures  for  staff  appointment,\nremoval, dismissal; determines pension, salary and benefits, rights and obligations; and the\nlegal  status  of  civil  servants  and  regional  civil  servants  including  teachers  and  principals.\nProvincial governments (i) define policy on student selection and acceptance including equity for\nminority  students,  students  from  poor  families  and  remote  areas;  (ii)  provide  instructional\nmaterials  for  basic  education;  (iii)  assist  in  higher  education  management,  curriculum\nproduction, accreditation, staff appointment, opening and closing of colleges; and (iv) manage\nspecial  institutions,  including  training  centers,  teacher  training  institutions,  and  special\n                                                          \n13Source: Statistical Office of the Ministry of Finance.\n14Preschools and senior secondary education (including vocational/technical) were also devolved.", "4\neducation. In addition, provincial governments may effect interdistrict transfer of civil servants\nincluding  school  principals  and  teachers,  and  their  transfer  between  districts  or  cities  and\nprovinces and vice versa.\n11. To  absorb  the  devolved  responsibilities,  district  governments  are  undergoing  major\nreorganization. District government structures vary but all include an executive body with an\nelected head and a legislative body or local parliament (DPRD). The local development planning\nagency (BAPPEDA) is responsible for overall development planning, including development\nstrategies and budget planning for the devolved sectors. BAPPEDA\u2019s Office for Social and\nCultural Affairs is responsible for planning for development and monitoring performance of the\nbasic education sector. Sector offices within the district government are responsible for daily\nmanagement and administration of the devolved sectors, including education. These sector\noffices replace the former district offices of the line ministries.\n12. Fiscal decentralization changed the financing arrangements for education, and replaced\nthe  past  system  that  earmarked  central  Government  grants  for  sector-specific  routine  and\ndevelopment budgets (Appendix 4). Under the new system, the central Government transfers to\nprovinces and districts (i) a portion of shared revenues (including land and property taxes,\nduties on land and property transfer, personal income tax, and nontax revenues from forestry,\nmining, oil, gas, and fishery); and (ii) block grants from a General Allocation Fund15 set at a\nminimum of 25 percent of the total domestic revenue of the central Government; and (iii) grants\nfrom a Special Allocation Fund earmarked for specific purposes. District governments determine\nthe allocation of both shared revenues and block grants from the General Allocation Fund to\nrecurrent and development expenditures across the 11 devolved public service sectors, in\nprinciple, in accordance with their development priorities. However, for the foreseeable future,\nrecurrent expenditure patterns (particularly personnel) will reflect the patterns inherited from the\ncentralized  system.  This  applies  especially  to  the  education  sector,  as  it  employs  a  large\nnumber  of  civil  servants,  particularly  teachers.  The  level  of  basic  education  financing,\nparticularly the development budget, will be determined by both the financial capacity of each\ndistrict government and by the relative priority assigned to basic education.\n3.  Key Subsector Issues\n13. Post decentralization Indonesia presents an opportunity to refocus on long-standing\neducation  sector  issues:  (i)  equity  and  quality  of  service  provision,  and  (ii)  efficiency  and\neffectiveness of management and financing.\na.  Equity\n14. The  impressive  rise  in  access  to  basic  education  masks  the  considerable  disparity\nbetween regions and income groups in access to quality primary education and to any form of\njunior secondary education. To reduce inequity, attention and resource allocation must focus on\n(i) provinces and districts with higher incidence of poverty; (ii) pockets of economically, socially,\nand culturally disadvantaged communities within better developed provinces and districts; and\n(iii) private primary and junior secondary schools that cater to poor communities and children.\n15. Poor Children\u2019s Access to Quality Basic Education. Achievement of universal basic\neducation in Indonesia requires concerted efforts to boost enrollment and completion of basic\neducation for low-income children by addressing not only poorer provinces and districts, but\nalso poverty pockets within relatively better-off areas. The national aggregate primary NER was\n                                                          \n15The General Allocation Fund is allocated through a formula based on (i) population, land area, and poverty index;\nand (ii) economic potential, including revenue-raising capacity.", "5\n92.6 percent in1999, yet the NER differed by more than 13 percent between the highest and\nlowest provinces (94.6 percent in North Sumatra and 80.9 percent in Irian Jaya).16 The variation\nin junior secondary NER is even wider, with a gap of 42.7 percent between the highest and\nlowest (77.6 percent in DKI Jakarta and 34.9 percent in NTB). Six provinces fell below the\nnational  average  primary  NER  and  13  provinces  fell  below  the  national  average  junior\nsecondary NER. Provincial NER ranking generally correlates with provincial poverty ranking.\n16. The  NER  within  a  province  is  not  homogeneous.  The  intraprovince  NER  variation\nbetween  income  groups  attests  to  the  strong  correlation  between  poverty  and  school\nenrollment. The NER among children from poorer households remains low, even within better-\noff provinces that exhibit high aggregate NER. While public basic education is tuition free in\ntheory,  families  still  bear  direct  costs  for  schooling  (e.g.  contribution  to  parent-teacher\nassociations, school uniforms, and supplies), indirect costs (lost children\u2019s household labor),\nand opportunity costs (lost income from children\u2019s earnings). These are significant burdens to\npoor households.\n17. Among the poorest provinces, NTB has one of the lowest provincial primary and junior\nsecondary  NER.  Yet,  the  NER  among  higher  income  children  is  at  par  with  the  national\naverage.  On the other hand, while the aggregate primary NER in DKI Jakarta (93.1 percent)\nwas above the national average (92.6 percent), there was an 8 percent difference in the primary\nNER between the highest income group (94 percent) and the lowest income group (86 percent).\nThe primary NER for children in the lowest income group in DKI Jakarta is one of the lowest in\nthe country, and well below the national average for the lowest income group (90 percent).\nPrimary school children from poor households in Jakarta are more likely not to be in school than\nthose in other parts of the country. The difference at the junior secondary level NER in DKI\nJakarta is even more significant.  While the provincial NER is the highest in the country, there is\na 35 percent difference in NER between the highest (80.1 percent) and lowest (44.9 percent)\nincome groups. More than half of children aged 13-15 years old in poor households in DKI\nJakarta are not enrolled in junior secondary schools.\n18. Disparity in Public Resource Allocation. The mechanisms used for transfer of the\nbasic education budget from the central Government to districts brought varied allocations to the\nregions. Data limitations (the likely result of the fragmented multiministry education financing\nsystem)  constrain  full  analysis  but  the  per-student  operational  budget17  in  2000  for  public\nprimary schools averaged $0.89 nationally and was $1.04 in Bali, $0.72 in DKI Jakarta, and\n$0.76 in NTB.18 Another indicator of disparity is the teacher student ratio. The national average\n(2000) is 27 students per teacher. Bali enjoys a high teacher student ratio (1:15), while DKI\nJakarta averages 27 students per teacher, and NTB has poor teacher student ratio (1:30).\n19. At the public junior secondary level, transfers of recurrent budget from the national\nGovernment19 to regions averaged $39.70 per student (2000). Transfers per student to Bali\nwere above average ($55.30) while DKI Jakarta and NTB were below average ($34.70 and\n$35.50, respectively). Within those provinces, resource allocation across districts was uneven,\ngenerally disadvantaging poor districts. In the case of DKI Jakarta, the relatively low level of\nbudget transfer was offset by supplements from the local government, parents, alumni/business\n                                                          \n16Provincial Poverty and Social Indicators SUSENAS 1993-1999, March 2000 appended to Poverty Assessment in\nIndonesia, ADB, October 2000.Data referred to in paragraphs 8 to 9 are for 1999.\n17This budget used to be transferred by the national Government to provincial governments to cover school\nadministrative costs, excluding teacher salaries, which are transferred separately. Reliable financial data on\nprimary schools is not available.\n18Mission estimates based on 2000 allocation data provided by Bali, Jakarta, and NTB.\n19Budget transfers covered teacher salaries, building maintenance, utilities, incentives/allowance for teachers,\ntransfers, learning materials and learning process support.", "6\ncommunities, and others. In addition, the high population density and larger schools in urban\nJakarta, probably permit greater economy of scale in resource use by schools. However, the\nlow transfers to poor and sparsely populated rural provinces with smaller schools (e.g., NTB)\ncould not easily be offset by contributions from local governments, communities, and parents.\nResource constraints limit the delivery and quality of basic education.\n20. The impact of fiscal decentralization on resource allocation for basic education is not yet\nknown.  In  the  absence  of  agreed  subsidy  mechanisms  within  the  decentralized  education\nfinance  system,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  fiscal  decentralization  will  offset  cross-regional\ndisparities  in  public  financing  for  basic  education.  Poor  districts,  where  provision  of  basic\neducation needs major improvements, require proportionately greater financing to achieve parity\nwith better-off areas. Local governments with weak local revenue-generating capacity (districts\nin NTB and poorer districts in Bali) require continued and substantial transfers of resources from\nthe national Government.\n21.  Role of Private Schools in Poor Communities. Inequity in basic education is also\nseen in the unique role of private schools in Indonesia. Private schools, particularly madrasah,20\nare prominent providers of basic education for poorer communities and children because: (i)\npoor rural areas are often under-served by the public system;  (ii) parents may prefer madrasah,\nparticularly for girls; and (iii) poor children with relatively weaker primary education may not be\nsuccessful entering public junior secondary schools where admission is based on competitive\nexamination results.\n22. Nationwide, private madrasah enroll 2.6 million primary schoolchildren (9 percent of total\nprimary enrollment) and 1.3 million junior secondary schoolchildren (14 percent of total junior\nsecondary  enrollment).  In  NTB,  private  madrasah  account  for  9  percent  of  total  primary\nenrollment and 27 percent of total junior secondary enrollment.21 The quality of education in\nprivate madrasah is generally low due to inadequate resources per student. Their operations\nrely much on community contributions, tuition fees, and parental contributions. Although private\nmadrasah receive some government support, including teachers seconded from public schools,\noverall resources are inadequate. Resources per student are much lower than in public schools.\nThere also are considerable resource differences by region with lower resources per student in\nlower income areas.\n23. Parents\u2019 economic capacity directly affects the resource capacity of private madrasah.\nWhile the average recurrent budget per student for public junior secondary school in DKI\nJakarta is $34.70 (2000), that for private madrasah in DKI Jakarta was $23.40, 67 percent of the\npublic schools. Per student resources are lower in poorer districts within DKI Jakarta. Private\nmadrasah in Jakarta Barat operated on $15.70 per student. The public-private gap widens even\nmore in rural NTB, where the public junior secondary schools had an average budget per\nstudent of $35.50 while private madrasah operated on $7.40 per student, only 20 percent of\npublic junior secondary school budget.22 Due to inadequate resources, madrasah catering to\npoor children offer poor quality education, are chronically short of teaching resources and\nteachers, and have limited capacity to implement the curriculum. Achieving greater equity in\naccess to quality basic education requires integrated strategies (i) to foster poorer children\u2019s\naccess to quality public education, (ii) to improve the quality of public schools serving poor\nareas and communities, and (iii) to support improvement of private madrasah.\n                                                          \n20While there are public madrasah, a large proportion of madrasah are private schools normally financed by\nfoundations and communities. Both public and private madrasah are supervised by MORA and implement\nCurriculum 1994 developed by MONE.\n21Source: Ministry of National Education, 2000.\n22Source: Ministry of Religious Affairs, 2000.", "7\nb.  Quality\n24. Studies on learning outcomes in Indonesia reveal that graduates of primary and junior\nsecondary  school  are  not  sufficiently  literate  or  numerate,  and  have  not  mastered\ncommunication and reasoning skills.23 On subject mastery, some improvements have been\nreported  from  achievement  test  scores  in  Bahasa  Indonesia  and  science,  but  not  in\nmathematics. Less-than-desired student learning outcomes are associated with constraints on\n(i) school leadership/management; (ii) teacher effectiveness (mastery of subject and teaching\nmethodologies);  (iii)  quality  or  availability  of  inputs  (instructional  materials,  facilities  and\nequipment); and (iv) policies, procedures and standards, including teacher assignment and\nmanagement policies, budget and resource allocation, curriculum, and learning assessment\ntools.\n25. The  Government  has  made  considerable  investments  in  school  inputs  and  teacher\ndevelopment: improving facilities, providing free textbooks to all primary and junior secondary\nschools, adopting various strategies and policies on pre-service and in-service teacher training.\nYet, many schools, particularly in poorer and rural areas, still remain below minimum conditions,\nas inadequate resource flows do not permit regular maintenance and provision of education\ninputs.\n26. School  inputs  alone  do  not  automatically  result  in  improved  quality  of  education.24\nInternational and local experience shows that the quality of education improves when schools\nexercise greater decision-making power. More attention needs to be geared to the critical roles\nof schools and classrooms, and overall school performance. So far, schools in Indonesia have\noperated as an extension and the lowest point of the largest bureaucracy within the public\nservice (i.e. the public education system). Schools do not have sufficient authority, effective\nleadership, staff, or resources to proactively improve the process of education and thus to\naddress the learning needs of students. Public schools have been accountable solely to parent\nministries; private schools have been primarily accountable to the foundations financing the\nschools. To increase school effectiveness to yield improved outcomes of student learning,\ngreater participation of the beneficiaries and communities is required. By empowering school\ncommittees,  the  Government  plans  to  encourage  school  principals  and  teachers  to  be\nresponsible for the educational process, while the school committees become responsible for\nschool management including planning, budgeting, resource mobilization, and monitoring of\nteacher effectiveness.\nc.  Effectiveness and Efficiency of Management and Financing  \n27. The  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  basic  education  system  in  Indonesia  were\nhampered by the rigidity of the centralized management and financing system. The complexity\nof  the  system  and  limited  interministerial  coordination  for  basic  education  management\nconstrained the system\u2019s capacity to devise and implement flexible solutions enhancing equity\nand quality. The budgetary process for basic education was fragmented across five ministries,\nand preparation of the recurrent and development budgets lacked coordination. The budget\nallocation process was not data based, due to the absence of a systematic or consolidated\ninformation system to track the details of education expenditures. The system did not allow\nadjustments to respond to local or school requirements, because fixed line items in the budget\nlimited  the  flexibility  to  transfer  resources  between  line  items  during  the  year.  Fund-flow\nmechanisms were cumbersome and resources for basic education diminished as they trickled\n                                                          \n23World Bank, 2000.

Interim Report I,  Regional  Education  Development  and\nImprovement Project.", "8\ndown the system, pointing to the need for a better fund flow system with enhanced governance\nto permit more efficient and effective use of limited public resources.\n28. Decentralization  and  the  consequent  consolidation  of  basic  education  finance  and\nmanagement responsibilities at the district government give an opportunity to streamline and\nrationalize education management and finance. If implemented successfully, decentralization\noffers the potential to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability, as well as to provide\na closer match between community expectations and the results of schooling, and to increase\ncommunity contributions to education. To achieve these benefits there must be: (i) sufficient\ninstitutional arrangements and capacity at all levels commensurate with the new functions and\nresponsibilities; (ii) effective vertical and horizontal communication mechanisms; (iii) human\nresources strategies to ensure rational and balanced staffing and skills mix at each level of the\ndecentralized  education  management  system;  (iv)  resources  for  social  services  during  the\ntransition;  (v)  an  education  budget  system  that  ensures  adequate,  equitable,  and  timely\nresource  flows  to  local  governments  and  schools\u2013commensurate  with  the  policy  to\ninstitutionalize school-based management (SBM) and to achieve of minimum service standards;\nand (vi) effective mechanisms to provide education-specific subsidies to disadvantaged districts.\nWithout these, there is a risk decentralization will contribute to further compartmentalization and\ndeterioration of overall service delivery, potentially widening the gaps in equity and quality of\nservice delivery.\n29. A parallel plan to enhance SBM and transfer greater management responsibilities to\nschools and communities offers an added opportunity to enhance the quality, efficiency, and\neffectiveness  of  education  management  that  depends  primarily  on  the  way  schools  are\nmanaged, rather than on the availability of resources.25 To maximize this potential, the process\nof  consolidating  decentralized  education  management  needs  to  integrate  development  of\nsupportive administrative systems (e.g. direct resource flows to schools) for SBM as well as\nleadership training and professional development of school principals.\n30. A smooth transition from centralized to decentralized management requires timely and\nadequate institutional arrangements by the district administrations, BAPPEDAs and DPRDs to\nabsorb the delegated responsibilities. Substantial capacity building needs to accompany this\nprocess to help the local institutions to effectively carry out the new responsibilities that range\nfrom  personnel  management,  finance,  procurement,  to  overall  sector  planning.  Capacity\nbuilding needs to encompass advocacy to gain district government support for basic education,\nincluding timely dissemination of key education sector issues as well as national goals and\npolicy  priorities  (especially  the  concepts  of  SBM  and  minimum  service  standards).  The\nestablishment  of  effective  mechanisms  for  objective  and  data-based  planning  becomes\nparticularly critical to foster rational, transparent, and efficient sector planning and local resource\nallocation. The capacity and interest of the district governments in education vary. Stakeholders,\nincluding heads of local government, DPRDs, civil society, and communities, are not necessarily\nfamiliar with education issues or effective sector strategies, as sector knowledge was formerly\nsequestered  in  the  local  MONE  offices'.  District  governments  are  expected  to  absorb\nresponsibilities over madrasah, and provision of adequate support to private madrasah needs to\nbe integrated within the district government\u2019s basic education plans. Furthermore, within the\nbroader national policy of institutionalizing school and community-based management, effective\ninvolvement of civil society and communities is important to create a demand for education\nservices and for transparent planning and management of education services by the district\ngovernment.\n                                                          \n25United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 2000. School Based Management.", "9\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n31. Law 25/2000 or the National Development Plan (PROPENAS) defines medium-term\n(2001-2004) national development policies and priorities. It attaches high priority to education\ndevelopment, and commits the Government to (i) reduce inequity, (ii) improve quality and\nrelevance, and (iii) enhance management efficiency. Within this framework, the Government\nplans to undertake a major development program for basic education, comprising three thematic\npillars: (i) achieving universal nine-year basic education by 2010, particularly by addressing\nunder-served areas and poor communities; (ii) enhancing transparency and accountability of the\nsystem by fostering SBM and community participation; and (iii) establishing school boards in\neach district, and school committees in each primary and junior secondary school.\n32. The PROPENAS also underscores the Government\u2019s aim to maintain a synchronized\nand integrated national education system, as management and delivery are decentralized.\nNational minimum service standards serve as one of the tools to ensure the integrity, equity and\nquality of post decentralization basic services.\n33. The formation and piloting of school board and school committees is scheduled to be\ncompleted in 2001. The concept of the school board and school committee is intended to\nsupport a system for delivering education that is more democratic, transparent, effective, and\nefficient, and encourages community and parent participation in education management.\n34. The Government defines decentralization of basic education as going beyond devolving\nresponsibilities to the district level. The ultimate aim is to transfer considerable resources and\nmanagement responsibilities to the school level. The Government has already piloted a national\nprogram on SBM during school year 1999/2000 in a selected number of public junior secondary\nschools in 27 provinces.  The Government plans to expand this initiative over the next few\nyears.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n35. Indonesia has vast experience in implementing education improvement programs and\nprojects,  with  both  national  and  international  financing.  The  main  funding  agencies  ADB,\nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAid), Canadian International Development\nAgency (CIDA), German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), Japan Bank for International\nCooperation (JBIC) Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), United Nations Educational\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and\nthe  World  Bank.  These  projects  have  supported  teacher  training,  education  management\nincluding preparing for decentralization and SBM. Investment projects (mainly through ADB,\nJBIC and World Bank) also provided textbooks, and rehabilitated and upgraded schools. Civil\nworks  increasingly  involve  community  management.  Given  the  size  of  Indonesia,  external\nassistance generally covered a segment of the country, either by province or district, although it\nwas managed centrally.\n36. ADB\u2019s support to the education sector in Indonesia started in 1975. To date, ADB has\nsupported 30 education and training projects totaling $2,117 million, and provided about $16\nmillion for 36 TA grants in Indonesia (Appendix 5). Until 1990, ADB supported mainly the\nvocational,  technical,  and  higher  education  subsectors.  Since  the  early  1990s,  ADB  has\nprogressively  increased  support  to  the  basic  education  subsector  that  is  now  a  dominant\nsubsector the ongoing program. Reflecting ADB\u2019s support to the 1994 Government commitment\nto achieve universal basic education and extend compulsory education to nine years, ADB\u2019s\nassistance  to  basic  education  has  covered  both  public  and  private  schools  (including", "10\nmadrasah), and aimed at increasing poor children\u2019s (particularly girls) participation in, and\ncompletion of, basic education, as well as improving the quality of learning outcomes. Since the\nfirst Junior Secondary Education Project26 in 1992, ADB has supported four investment projects\nand one crisis-response sector development program loan in basic education, with a total loan\namount of $414 million.  Lessons learned from the past or on-going support to basic education\nare discussed below.\n37. Recognizing the important role of school management in effective education, a number\nof projects supported training for school principals and introduced SBM. ADB and World Bank\ninvestment projects have supported fairly large-scale principal training programs on school\nmanagement  skills.  More  recently,  the  Government  piloted  a  program  on  SBM  in\nUNESCO/UNICEF and JICA supported projects that encouraged training in and implementing\nschool or site based management. Those projects provide school block grants as a capacity-\nbuilding tool, integrated with on-site training for communities and schools promoting community\nparticipation in school management and improvement programs.\n38. In addition, the crisis response program initiated with the ADB-supported SPSDP, joined\nlater by the World Bank, provided nationwide support to a scholarship and school block grant\nprogram. The SPSDP introduced and demonstrated the effectiveness of direct channeling of\nblock grants to schools and independent monitoring. The outcomes have been positive: primary\nand junior secondary school enrollments remained stable during the crisis. The SPSDP also\ninitiated substantial policy dialogue, laying the groundwork for post crisis Indonesia to further\ndevelop and refine social safety net mechanisms, through better targeting and improved access\nof the poor to basic social services including education. Attention during the crisis focused on\nboth protecting the poor and putting in place a framework of reforms designed to strengthen\ndecentralized  delivery  and  management  of  education.  The  gains  achieved  in  policy  and\nprocedural  improvements  need  to  be  sustained  along  with  tighter  targeting  to  increase\nenrollment  and  completion  rates  at  all  levels  and  transition  rates  from  primary  to  junior\nsecondary school of children from poor families.\n39. Preparing and processing DBEP involved extensive collaboration and coordination with\nother funding agencies.  Several joint project preparation missions were conducted with the\nWorld Bank, which is currently preparing a basic education project covering three provinces\n(West and South Sumatra and East Java).  The ADB and the World Bank projects share similar\nproject approaches and strategies. Preparation also involved close consultations with JICA and\nUNESCO/UNICEF  that  are  supporting  pilot  projects  in  SBM  and  community  participation.\nFurthermore, there are ongoing or planned projects supporting education quality improvement\nand  local  government  capacity  building  within  the  project  provinces  and  districts.  DBEP\npreparation and processing missions also consulted closely with those projects. DBEP's strong\npoverty  focus  and  emphasis  on  equity  complement  other  ongoing  efforts,  and  envisage\nconcrete  coordination  particularly  with  the  GTZ-supported  Science  Education  Quality\nImprovement Project in DKI Jakarta and NTB, UNESCO/UNICEF-supported Creating Learning\nCommunities for Children Project in NTB, and district government institution-building projects\nsupported by GTZ and district government projects in NTB supported by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n40. Past and ongoing projects, including those financed by ADB, have generated a number\nof pertinent lessons and recommendations. Experience with decentralization or decentralized\n                                                          \n26Loan 1194-INO: Junior Secondary Education Project, for $105 million, approved on 19 November 1992.", "11\nproject implementation in other countries in the region (e.g., the Philippines) also provides some\nrelevant lessons. These have been carefully examined and integrated into DBEP design.\n41. Block Grants to Schools. The SPSDP pioneered and demonstrated the effectiveness\nof block grants. The scheme has also been implemented through the Government pilot program\non SBM, the Creating Learning Communities for Children Project (UNESCO/UNICEF), and the\nRegional  Education  Development  and  Improvement  Project  financed  by  JICA.  Positive\noutcomes  include  (i)  quicker  and  more  transparent  flow  of  resources  to  schools  and\nbeneficiaries;  (ii)  effective  use  of  resources  to  secure  inputs  and  support  relevant  to\nrequirements of students, classrooms, and schools; (iii) efficient use of funds27 and minimizing\nadministrative levies on or leakage of project funds as they trickle down the system; and (iv)\ngreater sense of ownership and more proactive roles of schools.\n42. Sustainability of School Grants. Measures to ensure integration of the block grant\nscheme in the government (national and local) education finance mechanisms have been built\ninto the overall DBEP strategy. The Government pilot program on SBM has taken the step to\nintegrate block grants into MONE\u2019s development budget at the junior secondary level. In light of\ndecentralization,  district  governments  need  to  be  convinced  to  supplement  block  grant\nprovisions with the local education financing mechanism. This will require both an effective\npolicy framework at the national level and demand from schools and communities themselves.\nThe latter is particularly important under decentralization.\n43. Community Involvement. Sustaining the school block grant scheme in the local budget\nstructure requires both effective operations and creation of community demand addressed to\nlocal governments for school block grants. This calls for active participation of communities and\neffective school-community partnership in both planning and monitoring the use of the block\ngrants. Experience indicates that project activities involving community participation enhance a\nsense of ownership, sustainability of benefits, transparency, and accountability. Ongoing ADB\nand World Bank-financed projects demonstrate that community-managed school rehabilitation is\nmore cost-effective than centrally procured and contractor-managed civil works, and allows\nregular maintenance by community members.\n44. Joint  Training.  Effective  community  participation  requires  considerable  social\npreparation  and  training.  Experience  from  the  UNESCO/UNICEF  Creating  Learning\nCommunities for Children Project and JICA Regional Education Development and Improvement\nProject identified joint training among communities, school staff, and local administration staff as\nan essential step in fostering effective collaboration among all parties involved in school-or site-\nbased management.\n45. Teacher  Development.  With  a  quality  improvement  objective  within  the  broader\nframework of the Government\u2019s teacher upgrading program, a number of externally supported\nprojects have supported teacher development (mostly in-service training in both subject content\nand pedagogical methodologies). During the 1980s, teacher training was supply-driven, and\ntrainees received one-time mass training at central and provincial centers. Evaluation of these\nprojects noted limited effectiveness and sustainability of the mass training approach, and led to\nincreased use in the 1990s, of cluster-based and ongoing training at school sites. Teachers give\npositive feedback on peer support integrated into teacher development strategies.\n                                                          \n27The Project Management Unit of the World Bank- supported West Java Basic Education Project estimates that the\ncost of school and community-managed school rehabilitation was about 36 percent less than conventional\ncontractor-managed civil works.", "12\n46. Site-Based  and  Ongoing  Training.  The  effectiveness  of  training  is  enhanced  if\nimplemented on site (e.g., in the classroom in the case of teacher effectiveness, in the school in\nthe case of school management). One-time mass training was found less effective than regular\nand ongoing on-site training tailored to the requirements of smaller groups of participants.\n47. Technical Support. In addition to training, continuing demand-based technical support\nis desired to improve the effectiveness of community-based activities. For example, community-\nbased school rehabilitation will still require regular engineering and construction supervision\nsupport  to  ensure  the  professional  quality  of  work,  unless  community  members  have  the\ntechnical  requirements.  A  mentoring  approach  that  provides  onsite  technical  assistance,\norientation,  facilitation  and  coaching  has  found  to  be  effective  in  assisting  schools  and\ncommunities to implement these activities.\n48. School and District Committees. The SPSDP introduced the creation of school and\ndistrict committees as the body to oversee allocation and use of school block grants. Local\neducation  administration,  community,  parents,  and  school  staff  were  expected  to  be\nrepresented on the committees. The results of independent monitoring as well as discussions\nwith recipients have pointed to the need to improve the balance in committee membership. The\ncurrent committees tend to comprise largely public sector representatives including recently\nretired officials and teachers; this should be reversed to increase representatives from broader\ncommunities and civil society. Similarly, formalizing the school and district committees and\nensuing greater commitment and involvement of the members will require regular allocation of\noperational budget for the committees\u2019 activities.\n49. Transparency and Accountability. The critical importance of a public announcement of\nschool fund allocation, amount, and use was confirmed through the SPSDP, UNESCO/UNICEF\nCreating Learning Communities for Children Project and JICA Regional Education Development\nand  Improvement  Project.  Independent  monitoring  and  effective  mechanisms  for  resolving\ncomplaint are also essential for transparency and accountability of scholarships and school\nblock grants. The absence of clear consequences and penalties for infractions has limited the\neffectiveness of the current complaint resolution mechanism.\n50. Block  Fund  Allocation  and  Targeting.    Contrary  to  original  intentions,  the  fund\nallocation formula for the scholarships and school block grant program was applied rigidly and\ndid not take full advantage of the intended flexibility at district level. The resulting area-based\ntargeting excluded some poor schools and students in relatively better-off areas. The allocation\nof block grants in developmental projects must be proposal-based and targeted locally based on\na thorough baseline assessment and profile of poor communities.\n51. Use of Educational Inputs. Providing inputs alone does not improve the quality and\neffectiveness  of  the  teaching-learning  process.  Inputs  need  to  be  accompanied  by  well-\ndesigned orientation and training programs on input use, monitoring of the effectiveness of use,\nand  improved  school  management  capacity  to  translate  the  inputs  into  effective  teaching-\nlearning process and outcomes.\n52. Flexibility and Simplicity.   Experience from locally implemented projects in Indonesia as\nwell as in the Philippines underscores the need for a simple and flexible project design, and a\nfocus  on  long-term  institutional  and  capacity-building  support.  Compared  with  centrally\nimplemented projects with a top-down decision-making process, decentralized projects require\nprocess-oriented,  bottom-up  planning  and  implementation.  Decentralized  projects  involve\nconsiderably longer lead time before the implementation pace picks up, and hence require longer\nproject  implementation  periods.  Financing  arrangements  between  the  national  and  local", "13\ngovernments  also  need  to  be  flexible  and  simple.  Experience  also  shows  the  need  for\nconservative expectations of local governments\u2019 contributions to project counterpart funding while\nthe  decentralized  budget  and  finance  systems  are  being  tested.  In  addition,  a  safety  net\nmechanism is required for local governments with a smaller revenue base.\n53. Capacity Building.  A study of capacity building for district governments supported by\nthe United Nations Development Programme notes that strengthening institutions involves more\nthan training the staff. It requires various interventions that go beyond expanding the individual\u2019s\nknowledge and skills and include developing  appropriate organizational structures  and creating\nsupportive policies, systems, and management process.\nE.  ADB Sector Strategy\n54. The draft updated ADB policy on education28 sets six priorities in supporting ADB\u2019s\nstrategic policies to reduce poverty, enhance the status of women, and facilitate economic\ngrowth. The priorities are (i) increasing equity, access, and retention especially for the poor,\nwomen, and other marginalized groups; (ii) improving the quality of education at all levels; (iii)\nstrengthening management, governance, and efficiency, with emphasis on greater stakeholder\nparticipation; (iv) mobilizing resources for sustainable education delivery, while protecting the\npoor\u2019s access to affordable basic education; (v) strengthening collaboration with partners and\nbeneficiaries; and (vi) emphasizing more experimentation with and dissemination of innovative\nstrategies and technologies.\n55. Within the education sector policy and the broader context of the poverty reduction and\nhuman development objectives of ADB\u2019s operational strategy for Indonesia (2001-2003), ADB\nwill continue to prioritize support to education. Investment in basic education directly contributes\nto social and economic development, and yields a higher rate of return than investment in\nhigher levels of education. ADB support will aim directly at achieving universal, quality basic\neducation  primarily  by  addressing  regional  inequities  and  improving  basic  education\nopportunities for poor children, the group requiring focused attention. The basic education\nsector strategy includes supporting the process of devolving basic education management to\ndistrict governments as well as encouraging community participation in school planning and\nmanagement.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n56. Over the past decade, the Government and ADB have conducted regular policy dialogue\non the education sector. The policy dialogues centered around equity and quality issues, as well\nas  greater  integration  and  public  support  to  private  education  within  the  broader  sector\ndevelopment policies and strategies. The preparation and implementation of the crisis response\nprogram (SPSDP), the first policy-based lending to the education sector, consolidated policy\ndialogue on the basic education subsector. The SPSDP policy framework was not limited to\ncrisis-specific  issues,  but  encompassed  fundamental  policy  issues  related  to  long-standing\nconcerns of quality, equity, and efficiency of basic education. The policy actions agreed upon\nunder  the  SPSDP  are  even  more  relevant  to  post-crisis  Indonesia  that  faces  an  added\nchallenge  to  maintain  and  improve  basic  education  services  under  decentralization.  Policy\ndialogue through the DBEP preparation process built on the policy initiatives of the SPSDP, and\nfurther improvements and institutionalization of earlier policy initiatives. Discussions focused on\nequity and efficiency in decentralized management and delivery of basic education.\n                                                          \n28 Working paper discussed by the Board on 24 April 2001.", "14\n57. Achieving Equity in Basic Education Opportunities by Targeting Poor Children.\nDBEP is aimed at directly reducing disparities between regions and between income groups. To\nthis end, DBEP resources will be predominantly allocated to poorer districts, poverty pockets,\nand schools catering to students from low-income households. It is essential to ensure effective\ntargeting based on an objective measure of poverty and deprivation of the opportunity for basic\neducation. Targeting strategies and general criteria for DBEP were defined from an in-depth\nreview of lessons from past and ongoing initiatives as well as workshops with representatives of\ncommunities, schools, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and local governments in DBEP\ndistricts. In the absence of reliable subdistrict and village-level poverty and education data,\nDBEP, through pre-implementation baseline surveys (including school and teacher mapping),\nwill undertake thorough socioeconomic surveys in the sub-districts to capture the distribution of\nsocio-economically and educationally deprived communities. The information will be used in\nprioritizing and finalizing the selection of beneficiary schools, communities, and students. Each\ndistrict government will refine the targeting strategies with community participation, recognizing\nthe value of local community knowledge and the need to ensure DBEP's responsiveness to the\nlocal poverty context. To support poor students who will enroll and complete basic education,\nDBEP will employ various strategies such as improving the learning environment, scholarships,\nand other remedial support to reduce financial and other barriers to enrollment and completion.\n58. Fiscal Decentralization and National Government Support to Address Inequity in\nBasic  Education.  Post  decentralization  mechanisms  for  central  Government  education\nsubsidies to financially less capable local governments and/or support to implement national\npriority programs are being developed. ADB has provided TA to assist the Government to\ndevelop mechanisms to support basic education services for financially less capable local\ngovernments29 and plans assistance on mechanisms to transfer external loans to districts with\nvarying financial capabilities and for revenue and nonrevenue-generating projects. During DBEP\npreparation local budgets for basic education were reviewed, before and after decentralization.\nFinancing arrangements for DBEP, particularly for the poor districts that are the primary target\nbeneficiaries, were discussed with both central and local governments. DBEP intends to remedy\nthe existing gaps in basic education services in poor districts and poverty pockets. As such, the\nnational Government will remain as the sole Borrower of the ADB loan for DBEP and will\nassume  the  repayment  responsibilities  although  basic  education  is  devolved  to  local\ngovernments. However, to promote local ownership and to enhance the sustainability, local\ngovernments will supply about 90 percent of DBEP counterpart funding.\n59. The DBEP's primary focus is support to districts in NTB and poor districts in Bali with\nhigh poverty incidence, weak revenue-generating capacity, and consequent high dependence\non transfers from the national Government. Before decentralization, these districts received\nrelatively small transfers for education, and needed substantial additional resources to fill the\ngaps. DBEP includes a lower level of support to DKI Jakarta and the better-off districts in Bali,\nfocusing on schools and children in poverty pockets. Local government revenue is fairly strong\nin DKI Jakarta and southern Bali. Schools in DKI Jakarta enroll a large number of students who\nreside outside the province but commute to DKI schools, attracted by the relatively high quality\nof education in the capital. As a result, the children of poor DKI Jakarta residents are displaced\nby the commuting children who are financially better-off. DBEP support to DKI Jakarta will target\nexclusively the displaced low-income students who reside in DKI Jakarta.\n60. Since policies and strategies for fiscal decentralization are evolving, policy dialogue on\nthe implications of fiscal decentralization for basic education services will continue during project\nimplementation based on findings and recommendations of ADB TA and other studies. ADB\nand the Government will periodically review the effectiveness and relevance of the financing\n                                                          \n29 TA 3701-INO: Support for Decentralized Education Management, for of $990,000, approved on 8 August 2001.", "15\narrangements for DBEP and, if necessary, introduce mutually acceptable adjustments to best fit\nthe emerging context and to maximize the project benefits and sustainability.\n61. Enhancing  School-Based  Management.  The  DBEP  will  directly  support  the\nGovernment  policy  to  implement  SBM.  Through  the  provision  of  school  block  grants\naccompanied  by  intensive  on-site  capacity  building  for  SBM,  DBEP  encourages\ninstitutionalization of the financial autonomy of schools. Instead of a predetermined allocation\nformula, DBEP will introduce a system of proposal-based allocations to stimulate more proactive\nplanning, management, and decision making on school improvement initiatives in the school\nand the community. To enhance transparency and accountability of schools to communities,\ndirect and active participation of communities and parent-teacher associations will be an integral\nstrategy to enhance school-and site based management.\n62. Promoting  Effective  and  Efficient  Local  Education  Management.  Attaining  the\nbenefits of decentralization depends largely on the capacity of local governments to prioritize\nbasic education and ensure effective and efficient planning and management of the subsector.\nFinancial support from DBEP will be based on the commitment of the local government to\nprioritize  and  allocate  an  adequate  local  development  budget  to  basic  education  and  to\ncompleted  a  thorough  baselining,  situation  analysis,  and  medium-term  (five  year)  planning\nprocess. To maximize rational and efficient use of resources for basic education, DBEP will\npromote objective data-based planning and resource allocation at the district level. Where\nappropriate, rationalization or consolidation of schools will be encouraged. DBEP inputs will be\nused to provide incentives for school consolidation.\n63. Support to Private Schools Including Madrasah. The Government will continue to\nprovide public support to private schools, particularly madrasah catering to students from low-\nincome families. In this context, DBEP will encourage full integration of private schools and\nmadrasah as eligible beneficiary schools as long as they serve poor children. Baseline surveys\nand school mapping will cover both public and private schools, and the targeting process will\nensure full inclusion of madrasah serving poor communities. DBEP will also promote joint\nactivities between private and public schools, such as site-and cluster-based training. It is\nprobable that, in some areas, private schools will benefit more than their public counterparts.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n64. The PROPENAS and the ADB country operational strategies in Indonesia prioritize\npoverty reduction and achievement of regional equity. Achieving and sustaining these goals\nrequire equitable provision of quality basic education to the poorer segments of the population\nto set a foundation (i) to reduce existing gaps in human development across the country, and (ii)\nto  balance  the  availability  of  trainable  human  resources  to  support  social  and  economic\ndevelopment. The Project will contribute to these strategic goals through (i) focused investment\nin basic education targeted to poverty-affected areas, schools, and children; and (ii) improving\nmanagement and governance of basic education by supporting decentralization and measures\nfor transparency and accountability of the basic education system to communities and civil\nsociety.\n65. The PROPENAS commits the Government to achieve universal access to quality basic\neducation by 2010 and to address the needs and constraints of poor children as the foremost\nsector priority. Despite potential long-term benefits, decentralization is not risk free; any adverse\neffects are likely to impact more on the poor segments of society, whose access to quality basic", "16\neducation is already limited. At the outset of decentralization, therefore, timely support should\nbe given to poverty-affected communities and children. The Government, through the crisis\nresponse program, laid the foundations for mechanisms and policies (particularly school block\ngrants) to achieve equity, quality, and governance/management reforms the basic education\nsystem. The Project directly builds on the earlier achievements of the Government, to provide\nconsistent long-term support to ensure consolidation and institutionalization of the block grant\nscheme and policy initiatives.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n66. The broad goals of the Project are to contribute to (i) poverty reduction by addressing\ninequity in human development through improved access to and completion of the nine-year\nbasic education for poverty-affected children, and (ii) implementation of regional autonomy by\nsupporting decentralized management of basic education. The immediate objectives are to (i)\nimprove poor children\u2019s participation in and completion of quality nine-year basic education; (ii)\ndevelop the capacity of districts to plan, manage, finance and deliver basic education services,\nimprove  community  participation  in  developing  basic  education;  and  (iii)  demonstrate  the\neffectiveness of the proposal-and demand-based block grant mechanisms to support initiatives\nof the school, community, and district for basic education improvement.\n67. The Project covers primary and junior secondary education programs offered by public\nand private schools and madrasah in 21 districts in Bali, DKI Jakarta, and NTB. The Project\nallocates financing and support to each district in proportion to the incidence and depth of\npoverty.  Poor districts will receive higher allocation of resources; hence most resources are\nallocated to districts in NTB and in northern Bali where poverty incidence is high.  The Project\ncomprises  three  parts:  (i)  part  A:  school  development;  (ii)  part  B:  district  basic  education\ndevelopment; and (iii) part C: monitoring, evaluation, and reporting.\n1. School Development (Part A)\n68. This component, with two sub-components, aims to develop the capacity of schools\ncatering to poor communities and children to become self-managed schools accountable to the\ncommunities.  Activities  primarily  take  place  at  the  school  and  community  level.  School\ndevelopment will be implemented in 17 of 21 target districts where poverty incidence is above 5\npercent.\na. Capacity Building for School Based Management (A-1)\n69. This  subcomponent  supports  the  target  schools  catering  to  poor  communities  and\nchildren to become self-managed and accountable to communities.  Beneficiary schools will be\nprioritized  through  poverty  screening,  using  data  and  information  from  the  socioeconomic\nsurveys, family planning and welfare offices, and local or community knowledge. Key activities\nwill include (i) community preparation and socialization for SBM; (ii) establishment and operation\nof school/education committees; (iii) orientation and training workshops on SBM for principals,\nteachers, school committees, and other stakeholders; (iv) facilitated participatory baseline study\nand self-assessment of target schools; (v) participatory preparation of school improvement\nplans;  (vi)  orientation,  training,  and  implementation  of  community  monitoring  of  school\nimprovement;  and (vii) ongoing mentoring for beneficiary schools to implement SBM.", "17\nb. School Improvement through School Development Fund (A-2)\n70. The  School  Development  Fund  (SDF)  is  a  flexible  funding  mechanism  to  support\nimplementation of school improvement plans (para. 69[v]). The primary targets are schools\npredominantly catering to poor children, selected through poverty screening. The SDF will\nsupport the beneficiary schools to meet the minimum learning conditions, to improve poor\nchildren\u2019s enrollment (this includes re-entry of out-of-school children), completion, and learning\noutcomes. Communities, district project management and monitoring units, and independent\nmonitors will ensure transparency and accountability of SDF use in each school. External\nauditors will annually audit SDF accounts. Appendix 6 gives details of eligible items for SDF,\ncriteria and process for selecting beneficiary schools and mechanisms.\n2. District Basic Education Development (Part B)\n71. This component covers all 21 districts and aims to develop district capacity to effectively\nand efficiently plan, manage, finance, and govern the basic education system, as well as to\nimplement and monitor district programs to improve basic education services.\na. District Capacity Building to Plan and Manage Decentralized Basic \nEducation (B-1)\n72. This subcomponent supports (i) school-teacher-pupil mapping to capture the status of\nbasic education in each district; (ii) socioeconomic surveys at district and subdistrict levels to\ncapture the distribution and concentration of poverty; (iii) data-based self-assessment of equity\nand quality of basic education in each target district; (iv) facilitated assessment of the district\u2019s\ncapacity-building requirements to strengthen planning and management of basic education;  (v)\ndevelopment of a  medium-term (five years) plan to improve the basic education system in each\ndistrict;  and  (vi)  socialization,  orientation,  establishment,    and  operationalization  of  the\neducation or school board in each district.\nb. Improving District Education through District Education \nDevelopment Fund (B-2)\n73. This  subcomponent  introduces  a  District  Education  Development  Fund  (DEDF)\u2014a\nflexible  funding  mechanism  that  supports  implementation  of  the  priority  district  education\ndevelopment programs and identified capacity-building activities. While the scope of DEDF-\nsupported activities may vary across districts, DEDF will support activities aimed at (i) improving\nequity of basic education services, including support to poor children in districts or schools in\nbetter-off areas who not benefit from SDF support; (ii) improving the quality of basic education,\nincluding teacher development; and (iii) building district capacity to effectively and efficiently\nplan,  manage,  and  govern  basic  education  services.  The  school  board  and  the  Central\nFacilitation  Unit  (CFU)  will  monitor  implementation  progress,  and  transparency  and\naccountability of DEDF use.\n 3. Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (Part C)\n74. This component supports the systematic monitoring of the school development and\ndistrict  basic  education  development  components,  as  well  as  transition  monitoring  of  the\nprocess and impacts of decentralization on basic education service delivery in DBEP districts.", "18\na. Program and financial compliance monitoring (C-1)\n75. This subcomponent aims to ensure that (i) SDF and DEDF are awarded, distributed and\nused in accordance with the agreed upon criteria and guidelines established by DBEP; and (ii)\npublic accountability and transparency of the SDF and DEDF award and use are maintained.\nFor SDF, (i) the community will monitor the implementation of SDF-supported activities and use\nof the SDF resources; (ii)  the district project management and monitoring unit (DPMMU) will\nvisit the beneficiary schools regularly for routine compliance checks and random compliance\naudit; and (iii) independent monitors will make unannounced visits to randomly selected sample\nschools to audit school eligibility, selection process, and SDF activities against the school\nimprovement plan. For DEDF, (i) the CFU and provincial project monitoring unit (PPMU) will\nconduct  internal  monitoring  through  regular  visits  to  monitor  a  match  between  the  DEDF-\nsupported  activities  against  the  district  education  development  plan,  and  (ii)  independent\nmonitors  will  conduct  in-depth  compliance  audits  in  each  district  twice  during  project\nimplementation.  Financial auditors will audit SDF and DEDF accounts annually.\nb.  Progress and Performance Monitoring (C-2)\n76. Progress  and  performance  will  be  monitored  to  assure  that  project  implementation\nactivities are meeting targeted outputs and indicators of success. At the school and community\nlevels, the school committee will monitor progress against the school improvement plan, and\nreport on progress and outcome of the SDF-financed activities to parents, teachers, community,\nand DPMMU every quarter.  In the districts, the DPMMU will monitor SBM capacity building,\ndistrict  capacity  building,  and  progress  and  achievement  of  the  DEDF-supported  activities\nagainst the district education development plan on a quarterly basis, and report the progress\nand issues to the district school boards, district heads, and the CFU.  The CFU will review and\nconsolidate the overall project progress against the project implementation plan and logical\nframework, and report the progress and issues to the project steering committee and ADB.\nc. Benefit Evaluation (C-3)\n77. Benefit evaluation will measure the project results against stated goals, (i) to improve\npoor children\u2019s participation in and completion of nine years of basic education; (ii) to develop\nschool capacity to become self-managed, accountable, transparent, and effective; and (iii) to\ndevelop district capacity to effectively plan, manage, and govern a basic education system and\nservices.   Indicators to measure achievement of these goals are presented in the project logical\nframework (Appendix 1).  The actual performance targets for each indicator will be set by each\ndistrict through the district education planning process (para. 72). Project benefits and impacts\nwill be evaluated by independent evaluators at baseline, year four, and year seven.\nd. Transition Monitoring (C-4)\n78. The  transition  management  and  monitoring  unit  (TMMU)  at  MONE  will  monitor  the\nprocess and impacts of decentralization on education management and service delivery. ADB-\nfinanced TA29 will support TMMU activities at the national level and baseline situation analysis,\ncapacity assessment and initial capacity building of first phase districts covered by DBEP.\nTechnical support for capacity assessment, and capacity building in the first phase districts is\nexpected to provide recommendations on systems, regulations, and guidelines to make them\nconducive to and supportive of decentralized education management, SBM, and delivery of\noverall education services.\n                                                          \n29TA 3701-INO: Support for Decentralized Education Management, for $990,000, approved on 8 August 2001.", "19\nC.  Cost Estimates\n79. The estimated total project cost is $125.0 million equivalent, comprising $21.1 million in\nforeign exchange cost and $103.9 million equivalent in local currency cost (Table 1). It is\nproposed that ADB finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $78.9 million equivalent in local\ncurrency (76 percent of the total local currency cost). The Government will finance $25.0 million\nequivalent in local currency. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 7.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent ADB Government\nTotal\nForeign Local Local\nCost\nExchange Currency Currency\nA. Base Cost\n1.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $100.0 million equivalent from its Special\nFunds resources (ADF). The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8\nyears, with an interest charge of 1 percent per year during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nyear during the remaining term. ADB will finance 80 percent of the total project cost. ADB\nfinancing will cover 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 76 percent of the local cost\n(Table 2). The Government will finance about $25.0 million equivalent in local cost. The national\nGovernment will provide the loan proceeds through annual national budgetary allocation to (i)\ndistricts and (ii) beneficiary schools during project implementation.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost Percentage\nAsian Development Bank 21.1 78.9 100.0 80.0\nGovernment 0.0 25.0 25.0 20.0\nTotal 21.1 103.9 125.0 100.0\n81. In line with the decentralization policy and to encourage local government ownership,\nGovernment  financing  will  be  shared  by  the  central  and  local  governments.  The  central", "20\nGovernment  financing  is  estimated  at  about  $2.8  million  equivalent  (11  percent  of  the\nGovernment financing) and the local governments will finance about $22.2 million equivalent (89\npercent of the Government financing). The central Government will finance (i) salaries, offices,\nand operational costs of the central steering and technical committees, as well as the CFU;  (ii)\norientation, socialization, and training on DBEP concepts and key national policies on basic\neducation; (iii) school mapping and other baseline surveys; and (iv) progress and compliance\nmonitoring.  The district governments will finance (i) salaries, offices, and operational costs of\nthe district project implementation staff, (ii) salaries and incentives for school staff at the project\nbeneficiary schools, and (iii) incremental recurrent cost of project schools.\n82. It is proposed that ADB provide Special Funds resources and finance 80 percent of the\nproject cost. The reasons include (i) the persistence of severe economic and fiscal constraints\nresulting in large budget deficits in post-crisis Indonesia; other multilateral and bilateral banks\nsuch as the World Bank and the JBIC are now financing 80 percent or more of project costs; (ii)\nDBEP is nonrevenue-generating, primarily intended to support the achievement of universal\nbasic education for poor children and capacity building for local governments, schools, and\ncommunities; (iii) local governments finance a majority of the counterpart requirement, while the\nnational Government provides some counterpart and absorbs the repayment responsibilities for\nthe loan. The Project is classified as core poverty intervention, targets poor districts and poverty\npockets, and expects considerable positive impacts in reducing inequity in basic education\nopportunities  for  poor  children.  Loan  allocation  across  districts  is  based  on  the  estimated\nnumber of children below the poverty line. Poorer districts receive greater loan allocations. NTB,\nwhere all seven districts have 33-55 percent of school-age children below the poverty line,\nreceives 65 percent of the loan allocation. Bali, where four districts have 15 percent or more of\nchildren below the poverty line, receives 20 percent of the loan allocation. DKI Jakarta, where\nthe proportion of children below the poverty line is generally below 10 percent (but absolute\nnumbers are large) receives 15 percent of the loan allocation. Correspondingly, poor districts\nwill  provide  greater  counterpart  financing  responsibilities.  The  economy  of  the  poor  target\ndistricts is based on agriculture and fishery, and has low revenue- generating capacity. The\ncentral Government itself has a limited budget as fiscal decentralization transfers a larger\nbudget to local governments, and the overall Government budget itself is severely constrained.\nE.  The Executing Agency\n83. The Executing Agency of the Project will be MONE. MORA will co-execute the Project\nand second staff to the CFU, PPMUs, and DPMMUs to ensure balanced attention to the\nrequirements of madrasah that cater to poor children. Implementing Agencies will be the local\ngovernments of DKI Jakarta,30 nine districts in Bali, and seven districts in NTB. In line with the\ndelineation roles of decentralization between national, provincial, and district governments, with\nthe functions of executing and implementing agencies are defined differently from those in past\nprojects  in  Indonesia.  MONE  and  MORA  will  provide  overall  national  policy  and  technical\ncoordination and guidance, mainly on the SBM and minimum service standards. They will\nensure  that  project  implementation  adheres  to  Government  and  ADB  procedures  and\nguidelines, as well as be responsible for overall transparency and accountability in loan use.\nProvincial governments, through their education offices, will cover the devolved functions of the\nnational ministries, coordinate cross district activities, and monitor project activities at the district\nlevel.  District  governments,  will  carry  out  day-to-day  management,  administration,  and\nimplementation and will be accountable for the project activities and financial management in\ntheir respective districts.  The project execution and implementation structures are shown in\nAppendix 8.\n                                                          \n30The local government unit in DKI Jakarta, the national capital area, is administratively equivalent to a province,\nbecause its five districts/municipalities do not have the separate DPRDs..", "21\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Organization and Coordination\na.  National and Provincial Levels\n84. Project Steering Committee (PSC) and Central Technical Committee (CTC). The\nPSC will comprise directors general or equivalent senior staff of BAPPENAS, MOF, MONE,\nMORA, MOHA, representatives of the beneficiary local governments, and representatives of the\nPPMUs. The PSC is chaired by the director general of primary and secondary education of\nMONE and will provide overall guidance in project implementation. The PSC will (i) set the\nproject implementation policy, (ii) review project progress and impact, (iii) advise on project\nplans, and (iv) facilitate coordination between the different agencies and departments involved\nin  project  implementation.  The  CTC  provides  technical  guidance  and  coordination  at  the\noperational level, and comprises directors and division heads from BAPPENAS, MOF, MONE,\nMORA and MOHA; and is chaired by an official appointed by the PSC. The CTC will (i) oversee\nand give regular technical guidance to the CFU on operationalizing key policies including SBM\nand minimum service standards through DBEP; (ii) review the annual work plan and budget\nproposals;  (iii)  provide  technical  guidance,  review,  and  approve  project  implementation\nguidelines; (iv) review project monitoring and evaluation reports and advise on follow-up actions;\nand (v) resolve incidents and advise on follow-up actions.\n85. Central Facilitation Unit.  CFU will be responsible for overall planning, coordinating,\nimplementing and administering of DBEP, with staff from MONE and MORA. CFU will be based\nat MONE and will (i) orient districts on the DBEP objectives, design framework, and project\nadministration; (ii) monitor implementation in all districts and the provision of implementation\nsupport  required  by  the  districts;  (iii)  ensure  adequate  allocation  of  counterpart  funds;  (iv)\nconsolidate quarterly progress reports and annual reports, and submit them to the PSC and\nADB (in English); (v) ensure annual external audit of project accounts (national, as well as local\naccounts including DEDF and SDF); (vi) ensure timely submission to ADB of unaudited and\naudited project financial reports; (vii) ensure timely transfer of loan funds to districts; (viii)\nregularly monitor compliance and progress of the project activities in each district; (ix) identify\npolicy and technical issues requiring steering and technical committee\u2019s review and decisions;\nand (x) prepare for and coordinate regular review missions from ADB. The Government has\nestablished and staffed CFU.\n86. Provincial Project Monitoring Unit (PPMU).  Provinces in the Project will primarily\ncarry out the devolved functions of the national ministries (MONE and MORA), and focus on\ncoordination, facilitation, monitoring and evaluation of the project activities and impacts. The\nPPMU  will  be  based  in  the  provincial  education  office  and  staffed  by  BAPPEDA,  MORA\nprovincial office staff, and other relevant provincial entities.\nb.  District Level\n87. District Coordination Committee (DCC)/School Board Leadership and membership\nof the DCCs may vary, depending on the local administrative setup. It will typically be based at\nthe district school board, and its membership would overlap with the school board. Where\nschool  board  has  not  been  established,  the  DCC  would  include  representatives  from  the\nBAPPEDA, district education offices, MORA, as well as representatives from local NGOs and\ncivil society. The chairperson will be selected by the members of DCC. DCCs will address and\nresolve policy issues affecting DBEP, ensure adequate provision of counterpart funds, staff, and\nfulfillment of other local government responsibilities agreed upon for the project; and approve", "22\nSDF for junior secondary schools. The Government is establishing SBM teams in each district\ninitially within the local education office, but later to be transferred to the district school board.\nThe SBM team will be responsible for implementing the school development component.  DCC\nwill delegate the authority to review and approve school improvement plans of primary schools\nto a supporting unit of DCC at sub-district level.\n88. District Project Management and Monitoring Unit  DPMMUs to be established in\neach  district    will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  management,  administration,  and\nimplementation of DBEP. Functions would include but not be limited to (i) financial planning and\nmanagement of both loan and counterpart funds, and adherence to principles of accountability\nand transparency of project accounts; (ii) coordinating, planning, and implementing project\nactivities supported by the DEDF; (iii) monitoring SDF activities; and (iv) preparing district\nquarterly  and  annual  financial  statements  and  implementation  progress.  Considering  the\ndiversity of organization structures in the participating local governments, the base office of the\nDPMMU may vary across districts. Each DPMMU will be headed by a project manager whose\nqualification and experience are acceptable to ADB and will be supported by a secretary, and a\nteam of 6-8 persons specialized in education programs (primary and junior secondary, SBM),\nschool  rehabilitation  management,  finance,  procurement,  and  administration.  To  ensure\ninclusion of madrasah in the project activities, the DPMMU will have representatives from the\nMORA district office.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n89. The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  seven  years,  starting  in  2002  and  will  be\ncompleted in 2008. Implementation will be phased. During the first year (2001-2002), the focus\nbe on seven pilot districts. The remaining districts will phase in during 2002 and 2003. A\nprovisional implementation schedule is in Appendix 9.\n3.  Procurement of Goods and Services\na.  Consulting Services\n90. Consultant will be required for: (i) district capacity building and implementation support\n(Package A), and (ii) independent monitoring and evaluation (Package B). Package A will\ncomprise one international consultant (12 person-months) and 46 domestic consultants (1,656\nperson-months) Package B will comprise one international consultant (24 person-months), 26\ndomestic consultants (456 person-months), and about 300 test administrators. In addition, a\nseparate  package  of  mentoring  services  will  be  provided  under  the  SDF  component.  The\nmentoring services will comprise one international consultant (24 person-months), 13 domestic\nconsultants (684 person-months), and about 85 domestic community level mentors to work\ndirectly with the schools and the communities. A large number of domestic consultants are\nrequired because of the Project\u2019s emphasis on capacity building, independent monitoring, and\ndistrict and school-based project implementation. The consultants will be selected and engaged\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nacceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants. The  outline  terms  of  reference  for\nconsultants are in Appendix 10. On 21 May 2001, ADB Management approved retroactive\nfinancing and advance action for recruiting consultants to permit their timely fielding for effective\nproject  implementation.  The  Project  also  provides  for  retroactive  financing  of  eligible\nexpenditures incurred not earlier than 9 July 2001 (date of the first day of appraisal), for a\nmaximum of $2,000,000 equivalent. The Government has been advised that such advance\naction and the provision for retroactive financing do not commit ADB to finance any part of the\nProject.", "23\nb.  Training and staff development\n91. The Project will train parents, school communities, school staff, and district officials\nthrough workshops, mentoring, focused group discussions, seminars, and organized training\nprograms.  Training and orientation will benefit about 58,660 community members, principals,\nteachers and local government officials. Local governments will procure organized teacher\ndevelopment programs, depending on district needs, to be implemented by training providers\nengaged through a local competitive process, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.\nc.  Civil Works and School Furniture\n92. The Project will support the rehabilitation of school facilities that do not meet minimum\nconditions for learning. It is estimated that DBEP will cover rehabilitation of approximately 1000\nprimary and junior secondary schools. Small scale civil works (maximum of $12,000 per school)\nin remote and rural sites with associated difficulties in material delivery are unlikely to attract\ninternational  or  domestic  contractors  and  suppliers  at  the  national  level.  Past  experience\nindicate that community-managed rehabilitation ensures greater transparency accountability,\nand cost-effectiveness (footnote 27), and better sense of ownership and facility maintenance by\nthe communities. Therefore, civil works for school rehabilitation and school furniture (both labor\nand  materials)  will  be  procured  locally  by  beneficiary  schools  and  communities  through\nprocedures acceptable to ADB, based on procedures already working under ongoing ADB-\nfinanced projects.\n93. In the context of the three-year school improvement plan (para. 69), the schools and\ncommunities  will  jointly  prepare  a  proposal  for  facility  rehabilitation.  Once  the  school\nimprovement plans are approved by the DCC for junior secondary schools and by subdistrict\ncoordinating  committee  for  primary  schools,  the  school  committees  of  eligible  schools  will\nestablish community school rehabilitation teams. The teams will prepare detailed plan for school\nfacility rehabilitation with the assistance of the school rehabilitation supervisor at the district\nlevel. The school committee and the community school rehabilitation team will then organize\nand implement the rehabilitation work, largely utilizing locally available construction materials,\nwhere possible, and labor provided by the community members.\nd.  Office Equipment\n94. The  Project  will  procure  a  small  amount  of  office  equipment  for  the  project\nimplementation units (CFU, PPMU, and DPMMU), such as computers for administration and\ndata management, and vehicles. Each package is estimated to cost less than $50,000 and will\nbe procured under direct purchase procedures showing evidence of limited local tender to\nobtain the most competitive prices. As each district has slightly different requirements and\ndistricts begin project implementation in phases, the equipment will be packaged and procured\nby each district in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\ne.  Instructional Materials and Library Books\n95. The Project will finance the purchase of textbooks and other teaching/learning materials\nthrough the SDF school improvement category. Each school will determine actual requirements\nwhich will not exceed $6,000 per school. The schools will select and purchase textbooks and\nmaterials using direct purchase procedures. This procedure was selected because lessons from\npast  and  on-going  projects  indicate  that  consolidated  purchase  through  local  competitive\nbidding does not result in economy of scale or timely delivery. Delivery by contracted forwarders", "24\nis not cost-effective or reliable for remote and rural schools. School and community-managed\npurchase and delivery are more likely to ensure timely and accurate delivery.  The procurement\nmode and the packages are summarized in Appendix 11.\n4.  Disbursements, Accounts, Auditing and Reports\n96. To expedite the disbursement of loan funds, the Government will establish an imprest\n(special)  account  at  Bank  Indonesia.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,\nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and\ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The ceiling of the imprest\naccount will not exceed $10 million. Funds for DEDF and SDF categories will be transferred to\nbeneficiary districts and schools from the imprest account (Appendix 12). The districts and\nschools will use the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures.\n97. The Government will ensure that records and accounts adequate to identify the goods\nand services financed from the loan proceeds will be maintained. Separate accounts of the\nProject will be maintained, and accounts and financial statements will be audited annually by\ninternationally  accepted  external  auditors  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards\nacceptable to ADB.  Certified copies of such audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within\nnine  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  All  such  reports  and  statements  will  be\nsubmitted in English. The Government has agreed to finance from the loan proceeds costs\nrelated to the annual auditing.\n98. The  CFU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  implementation  of  project-funded\nactivities.  The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB, and will indicate, among other\nthings, progress made against established targets, problems encountered during the quarter,\nsteps taken and steps proposed to resolve the problems, compliance with loan covenants, and\nproject activities to be undertaken during the next quarter.  A project completion report will be\nprepared within three months of project completion.  All reports will be in English.\n5.  Anticorruption Measures\n99. The Mission explained the ADB anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud\nand corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants.  Project accounts including accounts held for SDF and DEDF will be audited\nannually by external independent auditors, and loan allocation provides financing for this.\n6.  Comprehensive Review\n100. Considering the process orientation of the Project, comprehensive reviews of project\nimplementation will be conducted at least twice, at the end of years 2 and 4. The first review will\nfocus on the effectiveness of the implementation mechanisms of the SDF, DEDF, funds flow,\nand poverty targeting. Improvements, as required, will be defined and agreed upon during this\nreview.  The  second  review  will  focus  on  the  overall  benefits  of  the  project  and  likely\nachievement of the Project objectives and goals by the end of the project.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n101. The Project will not have significant adverse environmental impacts, and is classified in\nenvironmental category C. Rehabilitation will comprise minor repairs of existing schools,", "25\nprimarily on land already allocated specifically for schools. Nevertheless, MONE, MORA and the\nparticipating local governments will ensure that the site, design, construction, and operation of\nschool  facilities  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected\nInfrastructure Development Projects and relevant environmental review procedures.\n2.  Poverty and Social Measures\n102. About 1.9 million families in the DBEP area are estimated to live below the poverty line.\nThe nature of poverty and poverty incidence (percentage of families living below the established\npoverty  line)  in  the  three  project  areas  vary  considerably.  DKI  Jakarta  has  urban-based\neconomic sectors and socioeconomic structures. While the overall poverty incidence is relatively\nlow (ranging from 1.4 percent in South Jakarta to 9 percent in North Jakarta), DKI Jakarta has\nthe highest Gini coefficient (0.461), indicating the worst income inequality in Indonesia. Poor\nhouseholds in DKI Jakarta are generally employed in the informal sector with low and irregular\nwages. Bali province as a whole has a strong economic base, associated mainly with tourism\nand related service industries. However, northern districts that depend on agriculture and fishery\nexhibit high poverty incidence. While poverty incidence in Denpasar City is 1.5 percent, poverty\nincidence in the northern districts is 18.8 percent in Karagasem and 14.4 percent in Buleleng.\nNTB, one of the poorest provinces in the country, is characterized by traditional rural poverty in\nIndonesia, based on predominantly tenant agriculture and fishery economy. Poverty incidence\nin NTB ranges from 24.2 percent in Mataram City to 45 percent in Dumpu.\n103. DBEP design takes these socioeconomic features into account by using a two-pronged\ntargeting approach to (i) skew resource allocation to districts with high poverty incidence and to\nschools serving poor areas (largely rural poor), and (ii) provide selective intervention in poverty\npockets in better-off areas (largely urban poor). The School Development component directly\ntargets  schools  serving  poor  areas,  on  the  assumption  that  their  school  population  is\npredominantly children from poor households. Under this component, socioeconomic surveys at\nthe subdistrict level and rapid assessments at school/community level, respectively, will be\nconducted to capture the distribution and concentration of poverty within districts as well as to\nobtain and validate site-specific and school-specific information. Based on the findings, the\nschools in each district will be ranked according to the expected enrollment of poor children,\nincluding the presence of out-of-school children for potential reentry to the school. Priority will be\naccorded to schools where at least 50 percent of the school population are children from poor\nhouseholds.    Such  schools  will  be  eligible  to  apply  for  support  under  the  SBM  and  SDF\nprograms.  In this manner, the poverty-oriented project provisions will be allocated to match the\nactual needs of the schools and the poor communities they serve.  Through the District Basic\nEducation Development component, DBEP provides a funding mechanism that will support\ndistrict activities to be proposed in the district education development plans aimed at targeting\nsimilar  support  for  poor  children  attending  schools  in  nonpoor  or  less  poor  areas.    Thus,\ntargeting of poor children will be effected in the context of a district-level effort to address social\nequity in the school system.  The mechanisms are described in Appendix 6.\n104. Two other pro-poor features are incorporated in the DBEP implementation arrangements\nto adequately match services and resources with site-specific needs of the poor communities.\nThe amount of assistance to be allocated under the SBM and SDF activities to target schools\nwill be proportional to the number of poor children they are expected to serve. Funds are\nearmarked for surveys and rapid assessments to ensure that the targeted schools have the\nnecessary information for accurate targeting of poor children and for executing their school\nimprovement plans.\n105. DBEP  will  directly  address  the  basic  education  opportunities  of  children  from  poor\nfamilies, examine gender barriers to basic education, and promote community involvement in", "26\nschool management. The major target group is disadvantaged children i.e., those from families\nengaged in the informal sector, in subsistence farming and fishing, in manual labor in the slum\nareas; female-headed households; and children from indigenous communities mostly below the\npoverty line.  The Project makes the community and schools, rather than distant district offices,\nthe major decision point to identify and prioritize support required by poor families to make their\nchildren to enroll and complete basic education.  The SDF provides financial and other support\nto reduce pressure on poor families to enter into debt to meet large expenditures such as entry\nfees and costs of uniforms.\n106. The Project incorporates several measures to address gender concerns and to meet the\nneeds of girls in acquiring and completing basic education. Women will be encouraged to take\nan active role in parent-teacher associations and school board committees within communities.\nSeparate toilets for boys and girls provided as part of the school rehabilitation program will\nbenefit girls\u2019 enrollment.  Targeted scholarships will make it easier for girls from poor families to\nattend and complete primary and junior secondary schools. They will also directly benefit girls\nwho bear the responsibility for meeting household needs, including school supplies, monthly\nschool fees, and other incidental expenses related to education.\n107. The Project will support the Government in designing mechanisms that promote more\ncommunity and civil society participation in basic education planning and management, and\nperformance monitoring.  The formation of school committees will lead to improved community-\nschool relationship through interaction programs, and teacher-parent meetings. The broad-\nbased school education committee will be an effective medium in guaranteeing the sustainability\nof decentralized education services.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Project Beneficiaries\n108. The Project almost exclusively targets children from poor families (para. 103). It is\nestimated that between 56 and 78 percent (an average of 71 percent) of beneficiaries will be\nchildren from poor households. The Project is estimated to benefit 1.26 million primary and\nsecondary school children (ages 7-12 and 13-15 years, respectively) in the 21 DBEP districts.\nOf this number, 0.896 million children (71 percent of the total beneficiaries) are estimated to be\nfrom families living below the poverty line. The Project will benefit about 5 percent of all school-\nage children in Jakarta, 29 percent in Bali, and 64 percent in NTB.  Beneficiary children in\nJakarta will consist largely of those residing in slum areas.  Beneficiary children in Bali are\npredominantly in the northern districts with a high concentration of poor tenant farming and\nfishing communities.\n109. By targeting poor children and using of poverty indicators in the selection criteria for\nbeneficiary schools (para. 103 and Appendix 6), the Project is expected to generate direct\nbenefits for children from below the poverty line and low-income families in two ways: (i)\nproviding opportunities to obtain and complete primary and junior high school education by\nhaving  access  to  scholarships,  school  fee  waivers,  tutorials  and  other  support;  and  (ii)\nsupporting completion of junior secondary education, improving their value in the job market and\nopening opportunities to continue formal education through senior secondary education and\nbeyond. Such benefits will be reflected in (i) surveys demonstrating at least 50 percent of the\nbeneficiaries of the scholarship and school block grants program will be children from families\nbelow the poverty line; and (ii) increased NER and completion rates among the children from\nfamilies below the poverty line. Benefit evaluation studies to be conducted during year 4 and\nyear  7  of  project  implementation  will  allow  for  monitoring  of  increased  primary  school", "27\ncompletion, transition to junior secondary schools, junior secondary school completion, and the\ngraduate\u2019s absorption into the labor market or entry into higher education.\n110. The Project will improve the ability of the beneficiary schools to deliver basic education,\nenhance the quality of education, and meet the needs of low-income and poor families through\nbetter  on-site  targeting  and  direct  parent-school  communication  to  remove  constraints  to\neducational  achievements  of  children  in  local  communities.  The  indicators  for  such\nimprovements include (i) participation of communities in the SBM subcomponent, (ii) budget\nallocations for scholarships and other school aid from the SDF to beneficiary schools, (iii) scores\nreflecting school efficiency and quality of education services, and (iv) reduced repetition and\ndropout rates among students.\nB.  Poverty and Social Impacts\n111. Preliminary  estimates  during  DBEP  preparation  indicate  that  about  3,000  schools\nclustered in poor communities in 17 districts would be covered under the SDF subcomponent,\nand an additional 115,000 children from poor households in all 21 districts will receive support\nunder the social equity program under the DEDF subcomponent. Assuming that all target\nschools are eligible for support, about 56-78 percent of students will be from poor families. It is\nnot possible to provide more accurate projections than these estimates as the specific project\nsites and beneficiary schools will only be determined during implementation, based on thorough\nsocioeconomic surveys to accurately capture the geographic distribution and concentration of\npoverty.  Nevertheless,  the  special  support  for  poor  children  and  the  targeting  criteria  for\nbeneficiary school selection will ensure that the Project covers children from families below the\npoverty line, and that at least 50 percent of the total beneficiaries of scholarships and other\nsupport will be from poor families. It should be noted that children from low-income but nonpoor\nfamilies will also be eligible for special assistance if they are otherwise unable to attend school.\nIn this manner, the Project is designed to address poverty using income as well as nonincome\nindicators of social deprivation among families with school-age children. Through this broader\ninterpretation of social deprivation, DBEP will contribute to the national objective of providing\nuniversal access to basic education.\nC.  Affordability and Sustainability\n112. In  line  with  decentralization,  district  governments  will  finance  the  majority  of  the\ncounterpart  and  incremental  recurrent  costs.  Financial  capacity,  particularly  local  revenue-\ngenerating capacity, differs considerably across the project districts. Jakarta and a few southern\ndistricts in Bali have a fairly strong local revenue-generating base. On the other hand, the poor\ndistricts  in  Bali  and  NTB,  with  economies  based  on  agriculture  and  fishery,  have  limited\nrevenue-generating capacity and are highly dependent on budget transfers from the national\nGovernment.\n113. In Jakarta and southern Bali districts, the Project selectively addresses poverty pockets.\nThe numbers of beneficiary children, resource allocations, counterpart financing requirements,\nand  incremental  recurrent  costs  are  relatively  small.  The  Project  is  easily  affordable  and\nsustainable in those districts. The loan investment accounts for about 0.5 percent of the total\ndistrict  development  budget,  and  about  7  percent  of  the  district  development  budget  for\neducation. Counterpart financing accounts for 0.1-0.2 percent of the total district recurrent and\ndevelopment budget annually. The incremental recurrent cost to sustain the project benefits will\nrequire about 0.1 percent of the total district recurrent budget and less than 0.3 percent of the\nprojected district recurrent budget for education.", "28\n114. The Project skews loan allocations to poor districts in northern Bali and NTB. The\nnumber  of  beneficiary  children,  loan  allocations,  counterpart  funds  requirements,  and\nincremental recurrent costs are greater in those poor districts where financial capacity is not the\nstrongest. These districts now allocate about 31-43 percent of the district budget to basic\neducation. DBEP will be affordable and sustainable in the poor beneficiary districts, provided\nthat (i) ADB finances 80 percent of the project costs, and (ii) beneficiary districts are able to\nmaintain or increase the level of the local budget through transfers from the national budget or\nincreased local revenue, as well as maintain and progressively increase the budget allocation to\nbasic education.\n115. In the poor project districts, DBEP investment is estimated to account for 4-20 percent of\nthe total district development budget or 56-150 percent of the district education development\nbudget  annually.  DBEP  will  provide  significantly  more  development  resources  to  basic\neducation in the target districts. The additional development resources and counterpart budget\nwill be primarily directed to schools catering to poor children; these schools are estimated to\naccount for 50-60 percent of the schools in the poor project districts. To maximize the use of\ninvestment resources, DBEP will employ community-managed school rehabilitation, which is\nexpected to cost 36 percent less than contractor-managed rehabilitation. Counterpart financing\nis estimated to require 0.6-1.9 percent annually of the total district budget, or 1.2-4.1 percent\nannually the district education budget.\n116. Annual incremental recurrent cost is estimated to account for about 2 percent of the total\ndistrict  recurrent  budget.  Use  of  community-managed  school  rehabilitation  minimizes\nincremental recurrent costs to the local government, as materials are locally available and\nfamiliar techniques are used permitting regular maintenance by the communities. To strengthen\nthe local government\u2019s resource base to sustain the benefits, the Project includes building the\ncapacity  to  make  financial  plans  and  mobilize  resources.  This  support  aims  to  help  local\ngovernments  explore  options  to  maintain  and  increase  their  budget  allocation  to  basic\neducation, as well as options to mobilize nonpublic resources, such as contribution from local\nindustries and foundations.\n117. An important gage of project sustainability is incorporation of the school block grant\nscheme in the local government financing mechanisms for education. The timing of the Project\nis favorable at the outset of decentralization when local governments are in the process of\ndetermining structure and mechanisms to channel resources to schools. The national policy on\nSBM is another positive factor, setting an example of transferring the national budget to junior\nsecondary schools as block grants. To pave the way to sustain the block grant scheme, ongoing\nADB-financed  TAs31  are  providing  parallel  support  covering  capacity  building  and  policy\ndialogue on ways to institutionalize the school block grant scheme in decentralized education\nfinance mechanisms.\nD.  Risks\n118. The  project  risks  are  largely  attributable  to  the  combination  of  the  decentralized\nimplementation  arrangements  and  intended  targeting  to  poverty-affected  areas.  Key  risks\ninclude (i) decentralized project implementation context, (ii) challenges exacerbated by the\nProject\u2019s attempts to reach the poorest communities and schools that are often remote and hard\nto reach, and (iii) heavy dependence upon consultants.\n                                                          \n31 TA 3042-INO: Capacity Building for Decentralized Social Services, for $900,000, approved on 9 July 1998, and TA\n3071-INO: Support for Decentralized Education Management, for $990,00, approved on 8 August 2001.", "29\n119. Consistent  with  decentralization  laws,  the  Project  will  be  implemented  by  district\ngovernments. A series of discussions with the local governments in DBEP pilot districts during\nproject preparation confirmed their high level of interest and commitment. Most districts have\nsome experience in implementing investment projects in the social sectors financed by either\nADB or the World Bank. Nevertheless, each district government is at the developmental stage,\nand a series of system, organizational, and staff changes are anticipated during the course of\nproject implementation. In addition, variations are expected in the organizational and system\nsetups in each district, including their relationships with the provincial and national governments.\nTo safeguard against risks associated with the newly decentralized administrative context, the\nProject  (i)  integrates  a  major  capacity-building  component;  (ii)  emphasizes  direct  resource\ntransfer to and involvement of schools and communities, the stable delivery point of basic\neducation services; and (iii) uses a process-oriented design that maintains maximum flexibility.\nThe  implementation  schedule  is  longer  than  usual,  anticipating  a  slow  start-up  and  low\ndisbursement during the first few years. Districts will begin implementation in phases. Undue\npressure on fast disbursement during the first years may undermine the need to build sufficient\nand accountable project implementation capacity.\n120. The Project targets poor areas that are often remote and difficult to reach, and where the\ncapacity  of  the  schools  and  communities  is  limited.  Building  the  capacity  of  schools  and\ncommunities is a pre-requisite before development activities and resource flows start. Such\ncapacity building in difficult-to-reach areas will require on-site, ongoing technical support that is\nnot threatening to the local communities. The Project plans to engage a large number of\ncommunity- worker type consultants (i.e. mentors) that can best be provided through NGOs and\ncommunity based organizations. While experience in ongoing projects has been positive, the\nuse of NGOs and community-based organizations is not yet a common practice in Indonesia.\nExperience in Indonesia indicates considerable lead time is often needed for the Government to\nengage loan-financed consultants; this may take even longer if the Project requires new types of\nservice providers.  To minimize the risk that project implementation may be consultant-led and\nto ensure localization of the project experience, the Project primarily uses domestic consultants\nand few international consultants. Mentors for SBM and decentralization/implementation support\nconsultants  will  work  closely  with  the  government  counterpart  teams.  To  ensure  timely\nengagement,  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  for  engaging  consultants  has  been\nendorsed.\nV.  ASSURANCES\n121. The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\nA.  Special Assurances\n(i)  Laws 22 and 25 of 1999.  The provision of funds from the loan proceeds and the\ncorresponding counterpart funds necessary for financing Project activities will\ncontinue throughout the Project implementation period by earmarking the funds,\nnotwithstanding any changes in national or district government responsibilities\narising from the full implementation of Laws 22 and 25 of 1999, unless ADB\notherwise agrees.\n(ii)  Funds Channeling. Unless ADB otherwise agrees, the loan proceeds will be\ntransferred  through  annual  budgetary  allocation  throughout  project\nimplementation to make payments for all Project expenditure, including, to (a) the\nparticipating districts, and (b) the beneficiary schools.", "30\n(iii)  Counterpart Funds. All counterpart funds for project implementation will be\nprovided on time. The Government and the participating districts will make timely\nsubmissions  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation  requests  and  ensure  prompt\ndisbursement of appropriated funds during each year of project implementation.\n(iv)  External  Auditors,  Annual  Auditing  and  Financial  Statements.  External\nauditors will be engaged to audit project accounts, including the DEDF and SDF\naccounts. The consolidated annual audited accounts and financial statements,\ntogether with audit reports, in English, will be submitted to ADB within nine\nmonths following the end of the relevant Government fiscal year.\n(v)  Poverty and Social Dimensions.  Priority will be given to children from poor\nfamilies, remote rural villages, and urban slum areas in the participating districts.\nAt least 50 percent of the beneficiaries are children from households below the\npoverty line. Beneficiary sub-districts and schools will be prioritized by incidence\nand depth of poverty, based on (a)  an integrated poverty factor calculated from\nthe proportion of families below the poverty line in the subdistrict, (b) NER, and\n(c) dropout rate. The process of prioritizing must be participatory.\n(vi)  SDF and DEDF. SDF will be given to schools registered with either the local\ngovernment of the project district or MORA or both, that serve poor communities\nand students. Identifying and selecting eligible schools, and the mechanics of\nawarding SDF will follow the criteria set out in Appendix 7. DEDF will be awarded\nto participating districts that have satisfied the requirements set out in Appendix\n6.\n(vii)  Support to Madrasah.  Madrasah will be included in the process of identifying\neligible  schools,  selecting  the  SDF  beneficiary  schools,  and  identifying\nbeneficiaries for the programs supported by the DEDF.\n(viii)  Community  Participation.    The  national  and  local  governments  will  ensure\ninvolvement of civil societies and full participation of beneficiary communities in\nimplementing the Project, and preparing and implementing of proposals for the\nSDF in preparing and implementing the DEDF.  DCC/school board will have\nadequate staff to represent madrasah.\n(ix)  Counterpart  Staff.    All  necessary  staff  and  facilities  for  the  CFU,  PPMU,\nDCC/school board, SBM, and DPMMU, will be maintained throughout project\nimplementation. The Government and ADB will review the effectiveness of the\nCFU and DPMMUs one year after the effective date, and if required, adopt\nmeasures to improve implementation effectiveness.\n(x)  Monitoring and Benefit Evaluation. The award, distribution, and use of the\nSDF  and  DEDF  will  be  monitored  to  ensure  that  they  are  carried  out  in\naccordance  with  the  agreed  upon  criteria  and  guidelines  established  by  the\nProject. To ensure that public accountability and transparency are maintained,\nbenefit evaluation activities will measure the project results against the Project\ngoals.\n(xi)  Gender. Special measures will be undertaken to promote the participation of\nwomen in the project activities.  In each participating district, (a) the school", "31\neducation  committees,  subdistrict  selection  committees,  and  board  education\ncommittees  will  include  at  least  two  women  representatives;  (b)  women  will\ncomprise  at  least  50  percent  of  teachers  in  the  development  programs;  (c)\nwomen will compose of at least 30 of the participants in workshops on SBM\ntraining;  (d)  girls  will  comprise  at  least  50  percent  of  the  recipients  of\nscholarships; and (e) separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys will be part of\nthe school rehabilitation component.\n(xii)  Environment.  Although no significant environmental impacts were identified,\nsite selection, design, construction, and operation of school facilities rehabilitated\nunder  the  Project  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental\nguidelines.\nB. Condition for Loan Effectiveness\n122. The effectiveness of the Loan Agreement will be subject to the issuance of decrees by\nthe Minister of National Education establishing the PSC and CTC.\nC.  Condition for Loan Disbursement\n123. Except for mobilization payment for consultants, loan disbursement will not take place\nuntil:\n(i)  decrees establishing of the DCC/school board and DPMMU are issued for the\nseven districts in the first phase.\n(ii)  the CFU has prepared and submitted to ADB, in form and substance satisfactory\nto ADB, the guidelines on consequences of noncompliance with or violation of\nthe project criteria on the use of DEDF and SDF, and the general code of\nconduct on the use of the loan proceeds.\nVI.  RECOMMENDATION\n124. I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 77,579,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Decentralized Basic\nEducation Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with\nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\nTadao Chino\n    President\n 31 October 2001", "32\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Project Framework 33 1, 2\n2 The Formal Education System in Indonesia 39 2, 6\n3 Education Expenditures in Indonesia 40 3, 8\n4 Financial Decentralization 41 4, 12\n5 ADB Assistance to the Education Sector 43 9, 36\n6 School Development Fund and District Education 45 17, 70\nDevelopment Fund\n7 Detailed Cost Estimates 50 19, 79\n8 Project Management Organization 51 20, 83\n9 Project Implementation Schedule 52 22, 89\n10 Terms of Reference for Consulting Services 53 22, 90\n11 Indicative Procurement Packages 57 23, 95\n12 Funds Flow and Disbursement Procedures 58 24, 96\n13 Poverty and Social Assessment 60 27,111", "33 Appendix 1 page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Project Indicators / Targets Monitoring Assumptions and\nMechanisms Risks\n(i)  Goal\nTo support PROPENAS Improved indicators in PROPENAS 2001- SUSENAS survey Local governments\u2019\n(National Development Plan) 2005 such as gross enrollment rates MONE and data commitment to national\ngoal to achieve universal nine- (GERs) of 120.7 percent for primary /MORA annual goals and guidelines\nyear basic education that education and 78.9 percent for junior survey data\nserves the needs of poor and secondary education.

Decentralization  has  drastically  changed  intergovernment  financial  relations  in\nIndonesia. Before decentralization, there were two transfers from the central Government to\nregional governments: (i) subsidy to regions, which was mainly used to finance salaries of local\ncivil servants; and (ii) regional development funds for development expenditures. These central\ntransfers were recorded in the regional budgets as \u201csubsidy\u201d and \u201ccontribution\u201d, respectively.\nStarting with fiscal year (FY) 2001, both transfers were eliminated and combined into the more\nflexible General Allocation Fund (GAF) set at minimum of 25 percent of total domestic revenues\nin the central Government budget. The GAF is allocated based on a formula that incorporates\nfinancial needs and the capacity of all regions. The GAF can be allocated for any purpose at the\ndiscretion  of  the  regional  governments.  With  the  introduction  of  GAF  and  the  widening\nresponsibilities of the regions, regional governments are expected to be able to make decisions\non budgetary allocations based on their own priorities.\n2.  Another newly introduced transfer channel is the Special Allocation Fund (SAF). Funds\nare made available to regional governments for investments in specific sectors given national\npriority. The funds can be provided on a matching-grant for basis projects that originate from the\nregional governments. In this system, regional governments are required to provide at least 10\npercent as counterpart funds.\n3.  An additional transfer from the central government is revenue sharing. Even before\ndecentralization, regions received a portion of revenues from the land and building tax, duty for\nobtaining rights on land and building, and forestry and mining royalties. With decentralization,\nthe regional governments can receive larger shares from these revenues and also new shares\nfrom the personal income tax and the on natural resources including oil, gas, and fishery.\n4.  In the central Government budget for 2001 includes all three transfers totalling $808\nmillion (revenue sharing $201 million, GAF $599 million, and SAF $9 million). Compared with\nthe previous year, the amount transferred to regions increased by 82.7 percent. Of this amount,\nprovincial governments received $106 million and district governments, which are the major\ntarget of decentralization, received $701 million (Table A4).\nTable A4: Central Government Budget\nItem Fiscal Year 2000 Fiscal Year 2001 Increase\n2000-2001\nPercent\n$ Million Percentage $ Million Percentage\nGrant Total 2,600 100 3,126 100 20.2\nCentral Spending 2,518 83.0 2,317 74.1 7.4\nRoutine Expenditures 1,813 69.7 1,882 60.2 3.8\nDevelopment Expenditures 345 13.3 435 13.9 25.9\nTransfer to Regions 442 17.0 808 25.9 82.7\nShared Revenues 35 1.3 201 6.4 486.1\nGeneral Allocation Fund 408 15.7 599 19.2 46.7\nSpecial Allocation Fund - -     9 0.3 -\nSource: Ministry Finance.", "42 Appendix 4, page 2 \n5.  According  to  Law  25/1999,  regional  governments  have  the  following  resources  for  their\nbudgets: (i) surplus of previous year; (ii) local revenue; (iii) balanced fund, which consists of revenue\nsharing, the GAF, and SAF; and (iv) regional loans.\n6.  Prior to decentralization regional revenues depended heavily on the central transfers. In the\nlast five years (FY 1995/96 to FY 2000), dependence on transfers from the central Government was\n58.3 percent in provinces and 84.2 percent in the districts. Local revenues accounted for only 33.5\npercent and 11.7 percent, respectively.\n7.  Traditionally,  regional  governments  had  access  to  only  limited  tax  instruments.  Major\nprovincial revenues came from the tax on automobiles, the fee for change of vehicle ownership, and\nthe tax on fuel for vehicles. The tax rates were determined by the central Government. At the district\nlevel, there were many minor excise taxes such as hotel and restaurant tax, entertainment tax,\nadvertisement tax, tax on street lights, etc. The district government could set their tax rates within the\nceiling rates set by the central Government. The Government revised the regional tax law (Law\n34/2000), and a new sharing scheme between the provinces and districts was introduced. However,\nwith the current assignment of tax instruments, it will be difficult for regional governments to improve\ntheir revenue position and significantly reduce dependence on central transfers.\n8.  Regional loans (development receipts) are marginal in the total revenues and account for only\nabout 1 percent in both provinces and districts. Weak revenue bases have limited the scope for\nregional borrowing, leading to heavy dependence on central transfers. To improve their borrowing\ncapacity regional governments must increase their revenues. However, the possibility of improving\ntheir revenue position is limited.\n9.  The  structure  of  the  regional  budget  is  prescribed  by  the  central  government.  Regional\nbudgets  are  divided  into  revenues  and  expenditures.  The  expenditure  part  comprises  separate\nsections for routine and development expenditures. The development expenditure is structured into\nthe same standard sectors as the national budget. However, the structure of routine expenditures\ndiffers  from  that  of  the  national  budget  in  that  there  is  no  analysis  by  sector.  Instead,  routine\nexpenditure is prepared by the spending agency of the regional governments, and is classified into\nfive categories: personnel, equipment, maintenance, official travel, and others.\n10.  In both the provinces and districts, the shares of current expenditure were about 60 percent of\nthe total expenditures. Current expenditures are mainly for personnel costs (49.1 percent in provinces\nand 70.2 percent in districts). There is little difference in the expenditure pattern of the development\nbudget at the provincial and district levels.", "43 Appendix 5, page 1\nADB ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR\nTable A5.1:   Loans\nNumber TITLE Date of Amount Closing\nApproval ($ million) Date\nA.

School Development Fund (SDF)\n1.  Objectives and Eligible Schools\n1. The SDF will finance school development and improvement activities at both private and\npublic primary and junior secondary schools catering to children from poor families in the project\ntarget districts. It will support two types of schools: (i) schools in disadvantaged areas serving a\nhigh proportion of children from poor families, and (ii) schools in relatively advantaged areas but\nserving poor communities and children.\n2. It is estimated that 10-60 percent of primary and junior secondary schools in the target\ndistricts will be eligible for SDF support. The actual proportion and the number of beneficiary\nschools will vary depending on the degree of poverty in a given district. Poorer districts will have\nlarger proportion and number of beneficiary schools.   It is estimated that about 2,100 (54\npercent)  primary  and  junior  secondary  schools  in  Nusa  Tenggara  Barat  (NTB):    500,  (16\npercent) schools in Bali, and 400 or 8 percent of schools in DKI Jakarta will implement school\nimprovement activities through SDF.\n2.  Identifying and Selecting Eligible Schools Through Poverty Targeting\n3. SDF will be provided to schools registered with either the district government or the\nMinistry of Religious Affairs that service poor communities and students. The Project will employ\na participatory process to select the SDF beneficiary schools. The district will rank subdistricts\nby  the  incidence  of  poverty  as  defined  by  the  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS).  Because  there\ncurrently is no information on the incidence of poverty below the district level, the Project  will\nfinance subdistrict and village-level socioeconomic surveys, to be conducted as an extended\nactivity  of  the  BPS\u2019s  annual  socioeconomic  surveys  at  the  district  level.    This  will  be\nimplemented to capture the distribution and concentration of poverty affected communities\nwithin each district.  In ranking subdistricts, districts will also use information on the (i) proportion\nof families categorized under the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN) welfare\nindicators, (ii) proportion of students from familiesin the lowest category (BKKBN data), (iii)  per-\nstudent expenditure at the school, (iv) commitment to school based management (SBM), and\n(v) subdistrict net enrollment and dropout rate data.\n4. Each subdistrict will then review and list the distribution of \u201celigible\u201d SDF schools, based\non  the  information  from  the  socioeconomic  surveys,  school  and  school  neighborhood\ncharacteristics, and local knowledge including consultations with villages. The subdistrict will\nprepare a list of eligible schools, and conduct participatory rapid assessments of eligible schools\nwith villages and communities. Then it will categorize the eligible schools into (i) poor schools in\npoor  neighborhoods,  (ii)  better  schools  in  poor  neighborhoods,  (iii)  poor  schools  in  rich\nneighborhood, and (iv) better schools in rich neighborhood but with poor children. This process\nwill be based on (i) the catchment community and student profile (parental income, occupation),\n(ii) conditions of school facilities compared with minimum service standards (including furniture\nand school sanitation), and (iii) interest in or commitment to SBM.", "46\nAppendix 6, page 2\n3.  Eligible Items for SDF support\n5. The  SDF  will  broadly  support  items  aimed  at  improving  of  (i)  equity,  (ii)  minimum\nlearning  conditions,  and  (iii)  quality  (teaching-learning  process  and  learning  outcomes).\nExamples of eligible items  follow:\n(i)  Equity\n(a) Financial and other support to students from poor households\n(b) Remedial/catch-up programs/tutoring for students who were absent to help\nfamilies (e.g., seasonal harvesting, fishing, etc.)\n(c) Alternative programs for children who are unable to regularly attend classes\n(i)  Minimum learning conditions\n(a) Repairs and rehabilitation of facilities that are dangerous to students\n(b) Purchase of classroom and library furniture\n(c) Basic water and sanitation facilities for schools\n(ii)  Quality\n(a) Textbooks and library books\n(b) Teaching aids and classroom supplementary materials\n(c) School and/or cluster based teacher development activities\n4.  Mechanisms for SDF Award\n6. School Improvement Plan (SIP). Once the local government determines the groups of\nschools eligible for SDF, each eligible school and catchment communities will receive intensive\ncapacity building/mentoring on (i) SBM, including community-school partnership and school\ncommittee formation or consolidation (if the school already has a school committee); and (ii)\nfacilitated self-assessment of school effectiveness, with full participation of communities, and\npreparation of the three-year SIP. The SIP will be simple, and specify priority activities to\nimprove  (i)  enrollment  and  completion  of  primary/junior  secondary  education  among  poor\nchildren in the catchment area, and (ii) effectiveness of the schools. The SIP will include simple\nimplementation and financing plans, where responsibilities of the local government, schools,\nand communities are clearly stated.\n7. Evaluation and Approval. SIPs will be reviewed and approved by the (i) subdistrict\ncommittees  for  primary  schools,  and  (ii)  district  committees  for  junior  secondary  schools.\nEvaluation criteria will include (i) clear identification of, and strategies to address (a) constraints\non participation and completion among poor children, and (b) school effectiveness; and (ii)\nevidence of commitment to school-community partnership in the school\u2019s development process.", "47\nAppendix 6, page 3\n5.  Implementing SDF\n8. Schools  and  communities  will  be  primarily  responsible  for  implementing of the SDF-\nsupported school improvement activities, including purchase  of school inputs, rehabilitation and\nrepairs, and organization of teacher development activities. The  Project  gives technical support\nto schools and  communities:  (i)  education  supervisors  at  subdistricts  and  district  education\noffices and mentors for matters related to educational inputs, teacher effectiveness, and school-\ncommunity  partnership;   and   (ii)   school   rehabilitation   supervisors   at   the   district  project\nmanagement unit for school rehabilitation matters. Mentoring services for SBM.\n9. The Project will provide mentoring services for SBM to the schools and communities\neligible for SDF. Mentors will work intensively with project schools and communities and assist\nthem in understanding the concept of SBM, developing, implementing and monitoring SIPs, and\nmanaging SDF.\n6.  Mentoring SDF-Supported School Improvement Activities\n10. SDF-supported activities in each beneficiary school will be monitored by three groups: (i)\ncommunity  members  in  the  school  catchment  areas,  (ii)  district  project  management  and\nmonitoring unit (DPMMU) for progress monitoring, and (iii) independent monitors for program\nand financial compliance.\n7.  Transparency and Accountability\n11. The Project will require SDF beneficiary schools to publicly announce (on bulletin boards\nvisible to the public) the summary of the SIP, amount of funding received from SDF, status of\nSDF use, and implementation of the financed activities. Each beneficiary school will prepare\nquarterly progress reports and monthly financial reports. Community members, independent\nmonitors, district and subdistrict officials, and other stakeholders should be able to review these\nreports any time. Schools will also be required to regularly report in a public forum to community\nmembers  on  activities,  progress,  and  financial  status  of  the  SDF  supported  activities.\nIndependent  monitors  and  external  auditors  will  regularly  check  program  and  financial\ncompliance of the SDF activities, and findings will be reported to the public.\nB.  District Education Development Fund (DEDF)\n1.  Objectives\n12. DEDF  will  support  district  initiatives  and  programs  aimed  at  improving  equity  and\neffectiveness of basic education within the district. DEDF will particularly support (i) activities\nthat can achieve better economy of scale if implemented at the district level, (ii) those that are\ndifficult or cannot be organized by individual schools or school clusters, and (iii) activities aimed\nat efficient and effective planning and management.\n1.  Eligible Items\n13. Examples of initiatives and programs that can be supported by the DEDF are as follows:", "48 Appendix 6, page 4\n(i)  Equity\n(a) District-wide campaigns and programs to promote enrollment, prevent drop-\nouts, and promote full transition of primary graduates to junior secondary\nschools,\n(b) Special support programs (e.g., scholarships) for children from low-income\nfamilies, but attending schools not covered by the SDF,\n(c) Implementation  of  alternative  programs  for  school-age  children  unable  to\nregularly attend schools,\n(ii)  Quality\n(a) Teacher  development  programs  (e.g.,  qualification  upgrading,  teaching\nmethodologies, etc) and any technical support for the district to address\nspecific constraints on quality\n(iii)  Management efficiency/effectiveness\n(a) Professional development of basic education supervisors, basic education\nplanners and managers at the district level\n(b) Essential office equipment intended for improvement of management and\nadministrative efficiency\n2.  DEDF Award, Implementation, and Monitoring\n14. Each  beneficiary  district  will  develop  a  medium-term  (5-year)  basic  education\ndevelopment plan, based on review and analysis of school-teacher mapping and socioeconomic\nbaseline survey. The plan will include (i) analysis of the current status of basic education in the\ndistrict, particularly with regard to provision of basic education services to disadvantaged and\npoor communities, overall quality of basic education services, and status of basic education\ncompared with national minimum service standards; (ii) five-year goals and priority activities to\naddress  constraints  on  equity  and  quality  of  basic  education  services;  and  (iii)  annual\nimplementation  plans,  financing  strategies,  and  responsibilities  of  districts,  schools,\ncommunities, and civil society for implementing the district basic education development plan.\nPlan preparation  will involve the local government, representatives of schools, communities,\nand civil society. Once the district coordination committee and head of district endorse the plan,\nthe proposal is submitted to, reviewed, and evaluated by the central technical committee.\n15. The district basic education development plan and financing for implementing it will be\nreviewed against established criteria: (i) clarity of goals and objectives, with demonstrated\ncommitment to improve equity and quality of basic education services;  (ii) commitment of local\ngovernments to basic education, as demonstrated by concrete contribution (in cash or in kind)\nfrom the local government in financing strategies for the plan;  and (iii) evidence of consultation\nand participation of a wider range of  stakeholders (civil society and school and community\nrepresentatives) in preparing the plan.", "49\nAppendix 6, page 5\n16. Once  the  plan  is  approved  by  the  national  technical  committee,  local  governments  will\nimplement their own development plans over 4-5 years. The project central facilitation unit and\nprovincial  project  monitoring  unit  will  internally  monitor  implementation  progress.  Independent\nmonitors to be engaged separately will conduct external monitoring.\n3.  Transparency and Accountability of DEDF\n17. Each beneficiary district will be required to publicly announce the contents of the district\neducation  development  plan,  the  formulation  of  which  involves  full  participation  of  civil  society,\nrepresentatives  of  public  and  private  primary  and  junior  secondary  schools,  non-government\norganizations, and other relevant stakeholders. Once the district is awarded DEDF financing, the\namount and implementation plans will be publicly announced through the local media, and progress\nwill be periodically reported to the public through newsletters and other  local means. Each beneficiary\ndistrict  will  be  required  to  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  and  monthly  financial  statements\nincluding amount, contents, selection process, and implementation plans for all contracts awarded\nunder the DEDF.  The Central Facilitation Unit and provincial project monitoring unit will regularly\nmonitor  the  progress  of  DEDF  implementation.  Independent  monitors  and  external  auditors  will\nregularly check program and financial compliance, and findings will be reported to the public.", "Project Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($000)\nTotal Project Cost  ADB Financing Government Financing\n Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total  District  Total\nExchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost National\nA.

The deposit for the imprest account will not\nexceed $10.0 million.  The account will be used to direct the loan proceeds through two systems\nof funds channeling: one for the School Development Fund (SDF) and another for the District\nEducation Development Fund (DEDF) and for other project expenditures.  The systems are\nshown in Figures A12.1 and A12.2.\nA.  School Development Fund (SDF)\n2. Eligible primary schools (Appendix 6) will prepare and send school improvement plans\n(SIPs) to the subdistrict coordinating committee and eligible junior secondary schools to the\nDistrict Coordinating Committee (DCC). Each SIP will be for three years, with an annual rolling\nplan budget.  Upon approval of the SIP, the schools will open a separate bank account in a\ndistrict/subdistrict branch of the selected bank1 to transfer SDF funds.  If this bank has no such\nbranches near the school, the school will open the bank account at the closest bank in its\nlocality.  Once the committees approve the school proposals, the DCC issues a decree signed\nby  the  chairperson  DCC.    The  decree  will  contain  the  list  of  schools,  their  bank  account\ninformation, and amount of funds to in transferred from the BI to each school for the first year.\nThe first year budget represents tranche one, i.e., the approved planned expenses for the first\nyear of the schools\u2019 activities.\n3. The District Project Management and Monitoring Unit (DPMMU)  will send a copy of the\ndecree to Central Facilitation Unit (CFU)  and to the district branch of the selected bank.  Based\non the decree, CFU will send the payment request to Ministry of Finance (MOF) to request for\ntransfer of funds, and MOF will issue a payment order to BI to transfer the SDF funds to the\ncentral branch of the selected bank.  Upon receiving the funds, the central branch through an\n\u201cinformation note\u201d informs its district branch of the availability of funds.  Immediately following\nthis advice, the district branch bank will transfer the SDF funds for the first tranche directly to the\nbank accounts of schools.\n4. The schools will submit to the DPMMU quarterly financial and annual program reports.\nBased on these reports, the second year plan of activities and budget may be revised.  Upon\nsatisfactory review of financial and program reports by DPMMU and DCC, the second tranche\nfor the second year budget will be released from BI to the school bank accounts in the same\nmanner as in the first year.  The same review and approval of reports will be necessary for the\nrelease of the third and last tranches of SDF.\n5. Within three months of each funds transfer from BI to the school bank account, DPMMU\nwill prepare the statement of expenditures (SOE) summarizing the SDF funds provided to the\nschools of the entire district by category, i.e., for school improvement and facilities improvement.\n                  \n1 The bank will be a state-owned commercial bank, which will be selected by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for the\ntransfer of SDF funds.  MOF will discuss and negotiate with 2-3 such banks for the best terms and conditions this\ntask.  The bank should agree to transfer funds without charging transfer fees, to transfer the funds as directed by\nthe DCC decree in the most efficient and timely manner;  and the transactions are subject to  independent audit of\nthe Project expenditures.  MOF will issue a decree to give the details of the agreement on the tasks to be\nperformed by the selected bank.", "59\n  Appendix 12, page 2\nDPMMU will use the bank statements from the bank district branch, attach these to the SOE,\nand submit these to CFU. MOF will send a copy of the payment order, BI statement, and bank\nstatement of the commercial bank central branch to CFU.  CFU will prepare the withdrawal\napplications based on district SOEs, attach the relevant BI statement, payment order and\ncommercial bank\u2019s statements, and submit them to MOF for endorsement and submission to\nADB for replenishment of the imprest account held at BI.  The transfers from the district branch\nof the commercial bank to schools\u2019 bank accounts according to the approved SDF budget\ntranche will serve as the basis for SOE.\n6. The Government will submit to ADB with appropriate evidence that the Government is\nalso disbursing counterpart funds for the parallel activities during ADB\u2019s review missions. The\nappropriate evidence will be based on the payment orders of Government expenditures for\nproject activities financed from the central Government and regional budgets.\nB. District Education Development Fund (DEDF)\n7. The DPMMU in each district will submit a five-year plan as well as an annual rolling plan\nand budget to the DCC/school board.  After DCC\u2019s review and endorsement, the DEDF plan will\nbe submitted to the Central Technical Committee (CTC) for approval, and CTC will inform CFU\nof the approval.  Based on this approval, CFU will inform the paying office of MOF in the district\nand DPMMU of the amount to be transferred.  DPMMU will then send a payment request to the\npaying office in the district to transfer the funds from BI to DPMMU project bank account,\nthrough a payment order.  This amount will represent the planned expenses for the first six\nmonths program of activities of DEDF (first tranche).\n8. DPMMU will submit a quarterly financial report and an annual program report to CFU.\nThe second tranche for the second six months activities will be released from the BI to DPMMU\nproject bank account in the same way through the paying office in the district office at the\nrequest of DPMMU, following satisfactory review of the first quarterly financial report by CFU.\nThe second and subsequent years\u2019 release of funds from the BI to DPMMU will depend upon a\nsatisfactory review of both the financial and program reports.  Revisions and adjustments may\nalso be made to the second and subsequent years\u2019 plan and budget.\n9. Within one month of each funds\u2019 transfer from BI to DPMMU, DPMMU will obtain a copy\nof the payment order from the paying office in the district and send it to CFU, and MOF will\nprovide a copy of the BI statement to CFU.  CFU will prepare the withdrawal applications and\nattach the relevant BI statement and payment order, and submit them to MOF for endorsement\nand submission to ADB for replenishment of the imprest account at BI.  The transfers from\ndistrict paying office from BI to the DPMMU bank account according to the approved DEDF\nbudget tranche will serve as the basis for SOE.", "Appendix 13, page 1\n60\nPOVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\nA. Poverty in the Project Area\n1. The incidence of poverty in the project area varies considerably from 4 percent in DKI\nJakarta to 33 percent in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB). While DKI Jakarta has a fairly low\npercentage of population below the poverty line, its Gini coefficient (indicating the gap in income\nbetween the rich and the poor) is the highest in the country. This suggests that other poverty\nindicators for DKI Jakarta, particularly those based on population \u201caverages\u201d, do not necessarily\nreflect the reality of poverty in Jakarta. During the economic crisis, DKI Jakarta had one of the\nlargest reductions in primary and junior secondary school enrollment.1 Bali is among Indonesia\u2019s\nmore developed provinces. The human development index places Bali 8th of the country\u2019s 30\nprovinces.  However, the province has many communities that can be classified as remote or\nisolated  and  there  are  emerging  signs  of  an  increase  in  poverty.    Poverty  is  evident  in\nagricultural and fishing villages, particularly around seaports in the northern part of the province.\nNTB is among the poorest and least developed provinces in Indonesia. As ranked by the human\ndevelopment index NTB is 26th of 30 provinces. NTB has the characteristics of traditional\npoverty, i.e.,  tenant agriculture or fishery-based and subsistence economy, where poor families\nlack cash-generating employment.\n2. Indonesia has been relatively successful in providing access to primary education in\neven the most remote villages. There is only a 3 percent difference in net enrollment rates in\nprimary school between households in the lowest and highest expenditure quintiles. Enrollment\nfrom poor households at junior secondary level is significantly below that of children from\nwealthier households.  There is a 35 percent difference in enrollment of children between\nhouseholds in the lowest and highest quintiles.  This difference is caused by a number of factors\nincluding the quality of the primary school experience and the significantly higher cost of a junior\nsecondary education due to the need for transportation, uniforms, books, and fees, and physical\naccess to junior secondary schools  in remote areas.\nB. Poverty Targeting\n3. Poverty  targeting  will  be  implemented  through  a  two-step  process  based  on  area\ntargeting and local knowledge about the schools and their clientele.  Allocation to districts has\nbeen  done  based  on  the  incidence  and  depth  of  poverty.    Districts  with  a  relatively  high\nconcentration of the poor will receive a high level and proportion of the school development fund\nas well as district education development fund.  Districts with a lower concentration of poverty\nwill receive DEDF using appropriate criteria to target individual poor students.\n4.  For allocation purposes at the subdistricts,  ranking according to welfare indicators will\nbe used to identify areas with a high concentration of the poor. Primary and junior secondary\nschools  will  be  targeted  by  different  criteria  to  take  into  account  local  variables  such  as\napplication-to- enrollment ratios  (a favored or better-off school will have a high application-to-\nenrollment ratio), low average scores on final State Exams (NEM), physical condition of the\nschool, dropout rates, and local knowledge based on feedback from the surveys.\nC.  Project Benefits and Impact on Poverty\n1.  Project Beneficiaries\n5.  The principal target groups are primary (age 7-12 years) and junior secondary (age 13-\n15 years) school-age children  from low-income households (two lowest income quintiles) in 21\n                  \n1  The British Council.  The Impact of Scholarships and Grants Program.  Jones, Hagul, and Damayanti. May 2000.", "61 Appendix 13, page 2\ndistricts in DKI Jakarta, Bali and NTB. The Project is estimated to benefit about 1,256,097\nchildren:  243,580  or  about  13.0  percent  of  the  school-age  children  in  DKI  Jakarta,  about\n156,971 or 25.0 percent of school-age children in Bali, and about 855,549 children or 75.0\npercent of the school aged children in NTB. By targeting poor children through the use of\npoverty indicators, the Project will benefit approximately 871,766 primary school children and\n161,972 junior secondary school children from families below the poverty line.  Table A13\nshows that approximately 72.25 percent of student beneficiaries are from families below the\npoverty line.\n6.  The Project is estimated to benefit 3,209 primary and junior secondary schools, of which\napproximately 64 percent will be in NTB.  The Project will improve the schools\u2019 ability to deliver\nbasic education, improved education quality, and services tailored to the needs of low-income\nand poor families.  Such families will be identified through direct parent-school communication\nto remove constraints to the educational achievements of the children. Furthermore, about\n31,000 teachers and 3,209 school principals will benefit from the Project through improvement\nof  (i)  teacher  effectiveness  (mastery  of  subject  and  teaching  methodologies);  (ii)  school\nleadership/management;  and  (iii)  policies,  procedures,  and  standards,  including  teacher\nassignment/management  policies,  budget/resource  allocation,  curriculum,  and  learning\nassessment tools.\n2.  Expected Social and Poverty Reduction Impacts\n7. By improving poor children\u2019s access to quality basic education, the Project will help\nimprove beneficiary children\u2019s opportunities for further education. Employment and hence better\nearnings will help break perpetuating intergeneration poverty. Recent studies in Indonesia2\nrevealed that in the 16-60 years age group, those who completed primary school earn 38.4\npercent more than those who did not. Assuming that each of the six grades of primary school\nyields the same increment to earnings, this implies that earnings increase by 5.6 percent for\neach grade at the primary level. Completion of junior secondary education yields an additional\nearning  increment  of  34.4  percent,  or  10.4  percent  for  each  of  the  three  years.    Senior\nsecondary education yields another 59.8 percent increase in earnings, or 16.9 percent for each\nof the three years.
