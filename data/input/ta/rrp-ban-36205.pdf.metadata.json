The initial environmental examination (IEE)  for the \nAssessment  Program was undertaken and the summary is in a core appendix. \n   \nThe Program Loan   \n   \nRationale  The Country Strategy for Bangladesh of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) aims to reduce poverty, by among others, promoting \nfaster  private  sector-led  economic  growth  by  accelerating  the \npace  of  structured  reforms  and  providing  assistance  for \nimprovement in infrastructure. The Sector Development Program \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  Power  Sector  Reforms  in \nBangladesh (PSRB) adopted in 1994 to (i) improve governance, \n(ii) build long-term institutional capacity, (iii) improve efficiency and \nfinancial  viability,  and  (iv) facilitate  private  sector  participation. \nSince 1994, the Government has, with the support of ADB and \nother  development  partners,  carried  out  the  following  major \nactions under its reform program: \n\u2022  introduction of private sector participation in generation; \n\u2022  creation of five new companies in generation, transmission, \nand distribution; \n\u2022  restructuring of the distribution areas; \n\u2022  reduction  of  system  losses  by  computerized  billing  and \nimproved collection management; and \n\u2022  Parliament\u2019s  passage  of  the  new  Energy  Act  2003  as  a \nfoundation  for  the  establishment  of  an  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission (ERC). \nThis phase of the reforms involves financial stabilization of the \nsector  entities  created  earlier  under  the  reform  program  and \ncorporatization of another four sector entities, to enable improved \ngovernance  through  regulatory  oversight,  and  to  introduce \nstructured competition and discipline in the sector. \n \nObjective  The objective of the Sector Development Program is to support \nthe Government\u2019s efforts to reform the power sector through the \nfinancial stabilization of two major transmission and distribution \ncompanies, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) and \nDhaka  Electric  Supply  Company  (DESCO),  and  partially \nBangladesh  Power  Development  Board  (BPDB)  and  Dhaka \nElectric Supply Authority (DESA) by settlement of outstanding \ndues  of  the  Government,  and  its  semi-autonomous  and \nautonomous bodies to the sector. These actions will prepare the \nsector for long-term financial sustainability and gradually relieve \nthe Government of financial support for the sector. ", "iv   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The loan will be for $100.0 million from ADB's ordinary capital \nresources. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 0.5% (the front-end fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Program \nAgreements.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2005 \n   \nEstimated Program  31 December 2004 \nCompletion Date \n \nTranching  The program loan will be released in two tranches of $50 million, \neach  to  support  restructuring  of  the  finances  of  PGCB  and \nDESCO through the settlement of the outstanding dues of the \nGovernment, and its semi-autonomous and autonomous bodies, \nto  the  distribution  entities,  DESCO,  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nAuthority (DESA), Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) \nand the rural cooperatives (PBSs), subject to policy initiatives \nconcerning  tariffs,  competitive  generation,  and  independent \nregulation being taken by the Government. \n   \nExecuting Agencies  Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral \nResources. \n   \nProcurement  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items, \nprocured for the power sector, produced in and procured from \nADB\u2019s  member  countries,  other  than  those  specified  in  the \nnegative list in Appendix 9 and imports financed by other bilateral \nand multilateral sources. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart funds will be used by the Government in accordance \nwith arrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support the financial \nrestructuring  of  PGCB  and  DESCO  and  the  adjustment  costs \nassociated with the Program. \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  v\nThe Project Loan   \n \nProject Description  The project loan has three components: \n \nPart A: Construction of 2 x 100-megawatt (MW) peaking power \ngeneration capacity at Siddhirganj near Dhaka. \n \nPart  B:  Construction  of  a  national  load  dispatch  center  at \nRampura in Dhaka. \n \nPart C: Renovation, upgrading, and extension of distribution in \nRajshahi, Serajgonj, Bogra, Pabna, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Joypurhat, \nThakurgaon,  Nilphamari,  and  Gaibanda  towns  in  northwest \nBangladesh. \n   \nRationale  The power system of Bangladesh is still suffering from: (i) load \nshedding due to lack of peak load capacity during peak hours \n(twice as high as the base load demand); (ii) lack of facilities for \nefficient  competitive  dispatch  of  the  power  generation;  and \n(iii) insufficient and unreliable supply of electricity in urban and \nrural areas outside Dhaka. In improving governance and financial \nperformance some of sector entities have already been set up as \nindependent  companies  although  still  financially  suffering  from \nearlier weak management. A joint intervention of investment in \ngeneration  peak  load  capacity,  load  dispatch  facilities,  and \nupgraded  distribution  system  simultaneously  with  further \nunbundling and corporatization of additional power sector entities, \nand  financial  support  through  settlement  of  the  Government\u2019s \noutstanding  dues  will  have  a  major  long-term  impact  on \nperformance and financial viability of the sector. \n   \nObjectives  The objective of the Project is to improve the quality of electricity \nsupply by (i) improving peak load generation capacity to reduce \nload  shedding,  (ii) introducing  competition  in  generation  by \ninvestment  in  a  new  National  Load  Dispatch  Center  (NLDC), \n(iii) improving  network  reliability,  and  (iv) increasing  access  to \nelectricity  services  by  upgrading  and  new  investments  in  ten \ntowns in the northwest of Bangladesh. This support will further \nboost the restructuring of the sector by transferring the operation \nof the urban distribution in northwest Bangladesh from BPDB to \nNorth-west Zone Power Distribution Company (being created) and \nimprove  losses  and  extension  of  electricity  supply  to  urban \nhouseholds and the commercial sector. This will also improve the \nsupply situation in rural areas under PBSs that are getting power \nthrough  medium-voltage  networks  of  some  urban  distribution \nsystems under the Project. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $328.5 million  equivalent, \ncomprising  $195.6 million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and \n$132.9 million in local currency costs. \n ", "vi   \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign  Local \nTotal Cost \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Percentage \n($ million) \n($ million)  ($ million) \n         \nADB Project Loan  186.0  0.0  186.0  56.6 \n         \nCofinance\u2014NDF   9.6  0.0  9.6  2.9 \n         \nGovernment/EAs  0.0  98.7  98.7  30.1 \n         \nDomestic  0.0  34.2  34.2  10.4 \nBorrowing   \nTotal  195.6  132.9  328.5  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EA = executing agency, NDF = Nordic Development Fund. \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $186.0 million, from ADB's ordinary capital resources will \nhelp finance Parts A, B, and C of the Project. The loan will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 0.5% (the front-end fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Program \nAgreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The loan proceeds will be re-lent to PGCB and BPDB (and later \nTerms  transferred to the new companies) pursuant to subsidiary loan \nagreements  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB. \nRelending terms to PGCB and BPDB will include a repayment \nperiod of 25 years including a 5-year grace period, and interest at \nthe  rate  of  5.0%  per  annum.  Foreign  exchange  risk  will  be \nassumed by PGCB and BPDB during the life of the respective \nsubsidiary loans. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  Implementation will begin in December 2003 and be completed in \nArrangements  December 2007. Direct supervision of subproject implementation \nand monitoring of subproject operation performance will be the \nresponsibility  of  the  executing  agencies  (EAs)  and  the \nGovernment.  These  agencies  will  provide  quarterly  progress \nreports to ADB covering their respective responsibilities within 30 \ndays  from  the  end  of  each  quarter.  ADB  will  review  the \nimplementation  and  operation  of  the  Project  based  on  these \nreports and meet with the EAs and the Government semiannually \nto discuss project progress. ADB will also monitor the overall \nperformance of the EAs. ", "  vii \n   \nExecuting Agencies  The EAs will be BPDB and the succeeding Siddhirganj Power \nStation Company for Part A, PGCB for Part B, and BPDB and the \nsucceeding North-west Zone Power Distribution Company for Part \nC of the Project. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by ADB will be procured following \nADB's Guidelines  for  Procurement.  For  such  procurement,  bid \nspecifications  will  be  prepared  so  as  to  ensure  maximum \ncompetition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  Advance \nprocurement has been allowed. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will support PGCB, BPDB, and the new generation and \ndistribution companies, for their respective parts of the Project and \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. Consultants will essentially provide \ndesign review, quality assurance services, and training. ADB has \nagreed to the request of the Government to permit internationally \nrecruited consultants to collaborate with domestic consultants.  \n    \nBenefits and  The combined intervention of the proposed investments and the \nBeneficiaries of Power  program components are strongly linked and will further enhance \nSector Development  the Government\u2019s ongoing reform program and strengthening of \nProgram  the power sector\u2019s financial and economic viability over the next 5 \nyears,  and  improve  sector  oversight  and  governance,  thereby \nproviding an assurance of sustained growth of the sector and \ngradually  relieve  the  Government  of  financial  support  for  the \nsector. The investment components will result in access to more \nreliable  supply  of  electricity  to  all  of  Bangladesh  through  the \nadditional peak load power generation capacity and increased \naccess to electricity in the urban and rural areas of the northwest \nzone  through  the  upgrading  of  the  distribution  system  and \nconnection  of  about  170,000  new  domestic  and  commercial \ncustomers. In the commercial category, most of the consumers in \nthe towns utilize between 100 to 120 kWh/month, indicating that \nthey operate small businesses and shops. The investments will \nhave a remarkable impact on the growth of cottage industries and \nenterprises  depending  on  electricity  for  lighting  as  well  as \nproductive purposes. A significant positive  human development \nimpact  is  envisaged  through  availability  of  light  for  education, \nimproved  water  supply,  and  diagnostic  health  services  from \nimproved power supply. The National Load Dispatch Center is the \nessential  linkage  and  prerequisite  for  introduction  of  full \ncompetition among the public and private generation plants in \nachieving the most economical dispatch. By enforcing commercial \ndiscipline in the sector, inter alia, corporatization of another four \nsector entities along with settlement of the Government\u2019s dues to \nthe sector and enforced revenue collection among the distribution \ncompanies, the financial viability of the entire sector will further \nimprove. ", "viii  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Program does not entail any major risks other than an ending \nof  the  continued  commitment  to  the  reform  program,  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s compliance with the settlement of the outstanding \ndues, and of the continued improvement in management of PGCB \nand DESCO. The sector has comprehensive experience in setting \nup  new  companies  under  the  Companies  Act  from  previous \nprojects and the settlement of the dues has been arranged in \ncooperation with the Ministry of Finance and has its full support. \nSimultaneously, the distribution companies have geared up their \ncollection  drive,  including  from  government  institutions.  With \nregard to the investment components, the EAs have sufficient \ncapacity from implementation of previous similar kinds of projects, \nhence there are no major risks in the investment components. For \nthe reform process, the appointment of competent regulators is an \nimportant factor and is to be carefully monitored by all concerned \nexternal funding agencies. \n   \n \n \n ", "  ix \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Power Sector Development Program and \nthe Power Sector Development Project. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The power sector in Bangladesh performed poorly through the late 1980s and 1990s. \nThe major constraints in the sector were (i) lack of institutional capability; (ii) unavailability of \nlong-term domestic capital for financing investments; (iii) limited foreign exchange debt service \ncapability of the economy; (iv) poor management systems and procedures; (v) low employee \ncommitment; and (vi) institutional weaknesses in governance, banking, law enforcement, and \njudicial processes, which are external to the sector but are essential for its proper functioning. \n \n3.  In 1994, the Government of Bangladesh adopted a paper titled Power Sector Reforms in \nBangladesh (PSRB), which was formulated in consultation with the major development partners \n(DPs)1 in the power sector. The PSRB outlined the reform process proposed to be followed by \nthe Government to gradually remove the constraints in the sector through improvements in \nsector and corporate governance, introduction of competition, and public-private partnerships. \nReform of the external environment was to be done through targeted interventions in the power \nsector. Sector and subsector analysis is further presented in Appendix 1. \n \n4.  Bangladesh\u2019s annual per capita electricity consumption of 110 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in \nFY2003 was the third lowest among the developing member countries of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), after Cambodia and Nepal.2 Despite intensive efforts to increase coverage, only \nabout 32% of the population has access to electricity.3 Consumption of electricity in Bangladesh \ngrew at an average annual rate of 8.2% from FY1994 to FY2002, with major increases in \nindustrial and residential use. The Power System Master Plan Study financed by ADB4 estimated \nthat the demand for electricity would increase by about 8% per year for the following 10 years, \nwhich has been the actual growth. The current installed capacity is 4,710 megawatts (MW). The \npeak demand met was 3,622 MW on 17 August 2003.  \n \n5.  Inadequate supply of electricity is a major constraint to economic growth. During FY2003, \nload shedding in the range of 5\u2013468 MW was resorted to on 210 days for a total duration of 767 \nhours. The situation has improved since November 2002 with (i) elimination of gas supply \nconstraints to power stations, (ii) full commissioning of the 360 MW Haripur independent power \nproducer (IPP) station, (iii) full commissioning of the 450 MW Meghnaghat-1 IPP station and \n100 MW expansion in Baghabari, and (iv) reinforcement of the Dhaka 230-kilovolt (kV) grid and \ncompletion of the Rampura 230 kV substation. Some load shedding is expected to continue until \nsubstantial new generation capacity is added to the system to (i) replace  very  old  power \nstations, (ii) allow for routine preventive maintenance through creation of reserve margin, and \n                                                 \n1  ADB, the World Bank, Department for International Development, Japan Bank for nIternational Cooperation, \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, and the United States Agency for International Development.  \n2  In 2001, the annual per capita consumption was 55 kWh in Nepal and 30 kWh in Cambodia. Comparable figures \nfor some other developing member countries (DMCs) were 340 kWh for India, and 950 kWh for Thailand. \n3  Comparable figures for some other DMCs are less than 10% for Cambodia, 18% for Nepal, 82% for India, 48% for \nPakistan, and 98% for Thailand. \n4  ADB. 1993. Technical Assistance to Bangladesh on Preparation of a Power System Master Plan. Manila. ", "2   \n(iii) meet the additional demand from new connections and suppressed load growth.  Erratic \npower supply has tended to increase the unwillingness of consumers to pay their bills, which in \nturn has led to shortages of funds for maintenance and has further aggravated the situation. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Government Policies and Plans \n6.  The  PSRB  envisions,  in  the  long-term,  a  structure  of  the  power  sector  based  on \n(i) separation of sector regulation and operation; (ii) autonomy and commercial orientation of the \nsector entities; (iii) separation of generation, transmission, and distribution; and (iv) increased \nprivate  sector  participation.  Under  such  a  structure,  a  new  regulatory  authority  would  be \nresponsible  for  (i) setting  electricity  tariffs  and  determining  the  corresponding  performance \nnorms; (ii) collecting, verifying, and disseminating sector statistics; (iii) reviewing and approving \nlong-term power planning; (iv) creating and maintaining a nondiscriminatory and commercial \nbusiness environment in the sector; and (v) adjudicating disputes between sector entities. While \ntransmission will remain in the public sector, generation and distribution assets will have both \npublic and private ownership. The objective is to eliminate monopolies and foster competition. \nCommercial  discipline  and  good  customer  service  are  expected  to  be  achieved  through \ncompetition among entities in the power sector.  \n \n7.  With the initiation of reforms in 1994, the organizational setup of the sector has changed. \nWhereas in 1994, all generation was with BPDB, today there are several public/private and \nprivate sector entities that have been licensed to construct and operate power-generating \nfacilities. The first private barge-mounted power station started operation in December 1998. \nThe first gas turbine of the Rural Power Company (RPC) at its Mymensingh site5 started \noperation in April 2000 and now has a capacity of 140 MW; construction of a 70 MW steam \nturbine portion is in progress to convert the plant to combined-cycle operation. Three barge-\nmounted power stations totaling about 310 MW are  operating, as are, since June 2002, the \ncombined-cycle plant of the Haripur (360 MW) IPP station, the Meghnaghat-1 (450 MW) IPP \nstation,6 and the 100 MW expansion at Baghabari. IPPs now account for about 40% of net \npower generation in the country. \n \n8.  As a direct result of assistance by ADB and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), five \nnew companies have been established\u2014 Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB), Dhaka \nElectric Supply Company (DESCO), RPC, Ashuganj Power Company, and West Zone Power \nDistribution Company. While RPC was a new start-up generation company, PGCB took over \nassets and liabilities of the existing transmission operations of BPDB and DESA, while Ashuganj \nPower Company and West Zone Power Distribution Company took over assets and liabilities of \nthe existing operations of BPDB. DESCO was created based on a transfer of assets and \nliabilities  of  the  Mirpur\u2014later  expanded  to  cover  the  erstwhile  Gulshan  circle\u2014distribution \noperations of DESA. Although PGCB and DESCO have improved their operations and have \n                                                 \n5 The Rural Power Company Ltd. has 72% of its shares held by private sector rural electric cooperatives and 28% by \nthe public sector rural electrification board (REB). It was established in 1994 as part of the policy dialogue for ADB \nLoan 1356-BAN(SF): Rural Electrification Project for SDR34.4 million, approved on 30 May 1995. \n6 Supported by ADB through TA 2338-BAN (ADB. 1995.  Solicitation for Private Sector Implementation of the \nMeghnaghat Power Project. Manila) for $211,000, approved on 30 May 1995 and increased to $595,000 in March \n1998; and Investment Loan 7165/1793-BAN (ADB. 2000. AES Meghnaghat Power Project. Manila) for $50 million \nloan; and 31909-BAN (ADB. 2000.  AES Meghnaghat Power. Manila) $70 million partial risk guarantee and \ncomplementary financing scheme no. 39, for $20 million, all approved on 5 December 2000.

As a result of these previous interventions in the power sector, major improvements have \ntaken place.

However, REB and DESCO have quickly \nturned around these areas and gradually improved their performance indicators. Simultaneously, this transfer has \nhelped DESA bring up its indicators for the remaining distribution areas. \nSource: Monthly management reports from the various sector entities. \n \n10.  Good governance, at both the sector and the corporate levels, is emphasized in the \nPSRB.  At  the  sector  level,  governance  is  to  be  improved  through  predictability  (long-term \nplanning,  codification  of  rules  and  regulations,  and  independence  of  regulatory  processes), \ntransparency  (systematic  dissemination  of  relevant  sector  information,  public  hearings,  and \ndiscussions on issues before they are decided), and accountability (cause-effect structure of \nincentives).  At  the  corporate  level,  governance  is  being  enhanced  through  corporatization, \nindependence of the boards of directors from the Government, introduction of work-based pay \nstructure, defined delegation of powers to staff, computerized management information systems, \nand commercialization of activities. \n \n11.  With regard to the Government\u2019s dues to BPDB, Rural Electrification Board (REB), and \nDESA, it is imperative for the Government to lead in commercializing the sector by liquidating \nthe arrears owed by it and its agencies to BPDB, DESA, DESCO, and the palli bidyut samity \n(rural electric cooperatives, or PBSs). In September 2001, the Government made a special \nbudget allocation of Tk690 million (about 30% of  its total dues) to settle outstanding dues to \nBPDB and DESA. This process will be continued and expanded under the Program to include \nDESCO and PBSs, along with a comprehensive financial restructuring of the sector, initially \nfocused on PGCB and DESCO. \n \n12.  The Government has agreed to compensate DESCO for losses incurred during the initial \nperiod of operations. DESCO assumed charge of the loss-incurring Mirpur area from DESA in \nSeptember 1998. At that time, the collection-to-import ratio of Mirpur was  35%. With great \nperseverance, DESCO has improved the operations in Mirpur and the collection-to-import ratio ", "4   \nnow  stands  at  over  69%.  DESCO  has  now  broken  even  on  a  cash  basis  in  its  current \noperations.  However,  there  is  an  overhang  of  accumulated  losses  incurred  during  this \nturnaround period of about Tk339.9 million ($5.8 million). Similarly, DESCO has just taken over \nthe loss-incurring Gulshan area from DESA in February 2003. However, the turnaround of \nGulshan will be more rapid than Mirpur since DESCO is already an established company and \nnow has trained human resources, and Gulshan is not as poorly run as Mirpur. To the extent \nthat there will be such a shortfall in the first year of DESCO\u2019s operation of the Gulshan circle, \nthe  Government  has  agreed  to  compensate  DESCO  for  earlier  accumulated  losses  by  a \nshareholders\u2019 unconditional loss-contribution. It is estimated that DESCO will incur a loss of up \nto Tk1,180.0 million ($20.0 million) during the interim period, which will be a burden on its \nfinances. It is the intention of the Government to facilitate DESCO to be the first profitable \ncommercial  distribution  entity  in  Bangladesh.  Hence,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  this \ncompensation.  \n \n13.  Bangladesh is facing an anticipated shortfall of about 2,500 MW of generating capacity \nover the next 5 years. This capacity comprises about 1,900 MW of base load generation and \nabout  600 MW  of  peak  load  generation.  BPDB  has  invited  (or  is  inviting)  private  sector \nproposals for the development of over 1,000 MW of capacity over the next 5 years, most of \nwhich will be awarded to foreign private companies. Peak load power plants are not exposed to \nthe same kind of competitive dispatch as the base load power plants, hence are unsuitable for \nprivate sector participation. BPDB is also seeking to redevelop its only hydropower project at \nKaptai to create about 100 MW of additional peak load capacity. However, actualization of \nadditional  capacity  will  be  constrained  by  the  inflow  of  revenues  into  the  sector  and  the \nperception of domestic and international investors regarding the need for an efficient and \nimpartial regulatory system.  \n \n14.  Under the reform program, the Government has made the following major achievements \nsince 1994: \n \n(i)  creation  of  a  competitive  diverse  market  of  independent  public  and  private \ngeneration companies; \n(ii)  restructuring of the sector by transferring all transmission assets and operations to a \nnew transmission company, PGCB; \n(iii)  through  corporatization  of  DESCO  and  West  Zone  Power  Distribution,  and \nrestructuring  of  distribution  areas  from  other  public-operated  distribution  areas, \ncreation of a manageable and competitive environment through bench-marking; and \n(iv)  in establishing a transparent energy sector, on 10 March 2003 Parliament passed \nthe  new  Energy  Act  2003  as  the  basis  for  establishing  an  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission (ERC). \n \n15.  The  Government  is  continuing  its  restructuring  program  to  enable  a  business \nenvironment  for  the  sector  that  would  be  conducive  to  improving  the  sector\u2019s  operating \nefficiencies,  financial  viability,  service  to  its  consumers,  and  conservation  of  electricity.  It \nproposes to do this through (i) encouraging and facilitating private sector participation in power \ngeneration and distribution and fostering a transparent and competitive environment with a level \nplaying field between the public and private sectors; (ii) adoption of a corporatized \u201cprofit center\u201d \napproach for optimizing the operations of the public sector power utilities; (iii) tariffs based on \ncommercial principles that enable costs to be recovered and reasonable returns to be made on \ninvestments; (iv) independent regulation and tariff setting backed up by statutory provisions; and \n(v) transparent, reasonable, direct, and quantified subsidies to targeted sections of consumers. \nParliament, on 10 March 2003, approved the ERC Bill, which lays the basis for the ERC for the ", "    5 \nelectricity  and  downstream  hydrocarbon  sectors.  USAID  and  ADB7  are  assisting  the \nGovernment in establishing the ERC, and in providing capacity building to comprehensively \namend the existing legislation, regulations, and tariffs in the sector to bring into effect the above \nprinciples. \n \n16.  After implementation of this Program the sector will have the following structure based \non FY2003 statistics: \n \nTable 2: Division of Generation Capacity and Power Generated \n \nInstalled  Share  Power  Share \nGeneration  Capacity  (%)  Generated  (%) \n(MW) \nBPDB (Public)   3,420  72.6  12,160  65.1 \nIPPs (Private)  1,290  27.4  6,531  34.9a \nTotal  4,710  100.0  18,691  100.0 \nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, IPP = independent power producers, MW = megawatt. \na \nBased on current installed capacity and a full year generation, the IPP share will increase to about 40%. \nSource: Monthly management reports from the various sector entities. \n \nTransmission   \nThe transmission grid has gradually been transferred from BPDB to PGCB, today the sole \nowner and operator of the entire transmission grid of Bangladesh. PGCB is created as an \nindependent  public  owned  company  and  just  recently  also  the  entity performing the \ndispatch function of the country. Completion of the national load dispatch center (NLDC) \nwill enable PGCB to ensure establishing a proper competitive regime for dispatch of \nelectricity on the basis of unit incremental cost of generation. \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 1997.

External Assistance to the Sector \n17.  Investment in the power sector during the last decade totaled $3.5 billion. The major \nsources of funding were ADB, World Bank, France, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Department for International Development (DFID), \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID), Nordic Development Fund (NDF), \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and \nRussian Federation. Other sources include the Islamic Development Bank, Kuwait Fund for \nArab  Economic  Development,  Saudi  Fund  for  Development,  Canadian  International \nDevelopment  Agency,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency, Belgium, Danish International Development Agency, Finnish \nInternational Development Agency, and foreign private sector. The PRC and the former Soviet \nUnion also provided suppliers\u2019 credit for power generation, transmission, and distribution. \n \n18.  While ADB has assisted generation, transmission, and distribution in urban and semi-\nurban areas, JBIC has concentrated its assistance on generation and rural electrification projects. \nDFID has financed transmission and distribution in the Dhaka area. USAID has been instrumental \nin establishing and funding REB and the first PBSs, and continues to provide technical support to \nthem.  KfW  has  assisted  in  augmenting  generating  capacity  and  in  reinforcing  transmission \nprojects. Other aid agencies have also financed generation projects, although France and OPEC \nhave financed some transmission and distribution projects as well. The World Bank (WB) had \nearlier supported generation projects and distribution in smaller towns and rural areas. However, \nafter the reforms were initiated, it has not provided any assistance to the sector other than ", "    7 \ntechnical assistance (TA) for soliciting private participation in power generation and establishing \nthe Power Cell, which is mandated to plan and execute reform related activities and act as a \nquasi-regulator until the statutory regulator is appointed. WB provided a loan of over $200 million \nfor creation of an infrastructure development fund in Bangladesh and provided a partial risk \nguarantee for Haripur IPP plant. After almost a decade of absence, WB has recently approved a \nproject  loan  of  $190 million  covering  rural  electrification  and  renewable  energy  and  is \nconsidering another one tranche program loan of $250-300 million. External assistance to the \npower sector is summarized in Appendix 2.  \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n19.  ADB has been extensively supporting the power sector over the last 25 years. From being \na provider of funds for individual projects in the 1970s, it became a provider of funds as well as \ntechnical advice in the 1980s. Since the adoption of the PSRB in 1994, ADB has been providing \npolicy advice to the Government in implementing the PSRB, as well as funds to help achieve the \nleast-cost expansion program. During this involvement, ADB has learned the lessons outlined in \nthe following paragraphs.  \n \n20.  The key lessons identified from two project performance audit reports8 (PPARs) included \n(i) need for more rigorous checking on least-cost design of projects; (ii) need to strengthen \nfinancial  management  and  transparency  of  financial  statements;  (iii) necessity  of  major \ninstitutional reforms and operational improvements for the success of a project/program\u2014they \nshould be made a precondition for further lending. All these issues have been addressed in the \nlast projects for Bangladesh and are the main scope for further reforms in this Program as well. \n \n21.  Delegation of powers from the Government to management of the sector entities and from \nthe management to staff is crucial for speedy and efficient decision making. Due to efforts by \nADB, delegation of power to the sector entities\u2019 boards of directors and management has been \nsignificantly improved, resulting in speedier decisions on procurement by the newly established \ncompanies. BPDB and DESA are also restricted by the Government's personnel and wage \npolicies; therefore, recruiting and retaining of competent staff and retrenching or dismissing of \nexcess or nonperforming staff are inhibited. The situation is being addressed and a beginning has \nbeen made by RPC, PGCB, and DESCO through market and work-based pay structures. The \nabove factors clearly underscore the limited extent of the improvements that can be made to the \nexisting power sector entities in their present form. It is therefore essential to (i) create new \nsector entities that are not subject to the organizational limitations of BPDB and DESA, and \n(ii) establish an overall environment of commercialization in the sector.  \n \n22.  Fundamental changes in infrastructure sectors take time to implement even in developed \ncountries. In developing countries, change is more difficult to implement and, therefore, requires a \ngradual approach. Speeding up reforms is functional only if the change is comprehensive. For \nexample, increasing tariffs too rapidly may help the finances of the sector but often undermines \nthe objectives of the reforms by penalizing the good consumer if the utilities collect only from a low \npercentage of consumers. Affordability is also a factor. Rapid rises in tariffs can drive up the costs \nof  electricity  so  that  it  becomes  unaffordable  to  poorer  consumers,  whereas  more  gradual \nincreases could have allowed time for managing the effects of the increase. \n \n                                                 \n8 Power System Rehabilitation and Expansion Project, 1992; and Seventh Power Project, 1998. ", "8   \n4.  Compliance with Reform Actions Under Earlier Asian Development Bank \nLoans \n23.  The ADB-financed Eighth Power Project9 closed on 23 February 2001 and the Rural \nElectrification Project (footnote 5)  closed on 29 January 2001. All structural reform-related \nconditionalities  stipulated  in  these  loans  have  been  met.  Likewise,  all  the  restructuring \nconditionalities stipulated under the ongoing Ninth Power Project10 and Dhaka Power System \nUpgrade Project11 have been fulfilled, although at a slower pace than initially anticipated. \n \n24.   Some of the major achievements under earlier ADB loans relating to reform actions that \nhave been accomplished by the Government are: (i) handing over all transmission assets to \nPGCB; (ii) corporatization of Ashuganj Power Station; (iii) handing over distribution assets to \nDESCO and REB; and (iv) creation of the West Zone Power Distribution Company. \n \n25.  The fulfillment of some conditions related to restructuring has been delayed, in some \ncases by over a year, e.g., some parts of the transfer of transmission grid from DESA to PGCB \nand  distribution  grid  from  DESA  to  DESCO.  Nevertheless,  the  Government  must  be \ncomplimented in its determination to follow through with these politically difficult and sensitive \nactions. Some actions have led to law and order problems that the Government had to tackle \nfirmly. Since the reform program started in 1994, the Government has always delivered on the \nconditionalities it has agreed to as part of the process of power sector reforms. The Government \nhas also, on its own, started the process of rationalizing retail electricity tariffs for residential \nconsumers  of  BPDB  and  DESA,  as  also  the  base  retail  tariffs  for  the  sector.  Effective \n1 September 2003, the Government reduced domestic tariff slabs from five to three and raised \ntariffs in all three slabs, leading to a weighted average increase of about 5%. The Government is \nalso preparing a tariff policy that will help the regulator set tariffs in the future. This gives DPs \nconfidence that the Government will take the necessary actions to determinedly pursue reforms in \nthe future.  \n \n5.  Performance of Executing Agencies \n26.  The political unrest in the country over the last few years has significantly affected the \ncollection operations of both BPDB and DESA, since many commercial establishments, including \nbanks, were closed for prolonged periods and those that were open functioned with minimal \nservices. DESA was particularly hard hit since Dhaka, as the capital city, was the center of the \nunrest, and normal life in the city was disrupted for longer periods than in other towns. During \nFY2000, the collection-to-generation ratio of BPDB and the collection-to-import ratio of DESA \nwere 65.9% and 65.1%, respectively. These were way below the targets, which were 75% for \nBPDB and 70% for DESA. In FY2001, however, with the implementation of the ADB-funded \nFinancial  Management  Upgrade  Project,12  the  collection  performance  of  both  utilities  has \nimproved dramatically, resulting in a collection-generation ratio of 70.8% for BPDB. DESA\u2019s \nperformance remained stagnant on account of the deferred payments instituted with the PBSs \nthat had just taken over DESA\u2019s loss-incurring rural areas in FY1999.

REB\u2019s (PBSs\u2019) overall collection-\nimport performance deteriorated slightly to 77.4% in FY2001 on account of the bad areas taken \nover from DESA. However, the trends are in the right direction and these PBSs should contribute \npositively to the sector\u2019s financial viability in FY2003. Along with delegation of power, close \nfinancial monitoring of operations is crucial to improved performance. Financial and operational \nperformance indicators of BPDB, DESA, REB (PBSs), and DESCO have been closely monitored \non a monthly basis over the last 8 years since the start of reforms. Performance indicators are \nsummarized in Appendix 1. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n27.  ADB recognizes that (i) the substantial external assistance to the sector in the past has \ninduced a tendency in the sector agencies to depend on external assistance for their funding; \n(ii) recovery and development must come from within the sector; and (iii) the Government and all \nmajor aid agencies must realign their individual strategies to emphasize the objective in (ii). In \nconsultation with the Government and the other DPs involved in the sector, ADB has developed \nits strategy to improve the power sector in Bangladesh. The strategy consists of (i) changes in the \nbusiness environment through corporatization, commercialization, and increasing private sector \nparticipation;  (ii) institutional  improvements  in  BPDB  and  DESA;  (iii) creation  of  new  sector \nagencies that could serve as role models for the sector; (iv) enlarging the scope of the PBSs; and \n(v) strengthening the long-term planning and regulatory processes in the sector. The proposed \nProgram addresses items (i), (ii), and (iii) of this strategy. Item (iv) is an ongoing process and item \n(v) has partially been addressed through the Power System Master Plan (PSMP), the creation of \nthe  Power  Cell,  and  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  (TA)  Support  for  an  Energy  Regulatory \nAuthority,13 which supports the establishment of the ERC.  \n \n28.  In the past, ADB and other DPs extended assistance to discrete power projects in \nBangladesh on a \u201cpolicy reform linked assistance\u201d, with substantial policy actions to be taken as \npreconditions for such assistance. This approach enabled the Government and the executing \nagencies (EAs)  to gradually build technical and managerial capacity in the sector. Further, this \ngradual approach has allowed for a smooth transition from the prereform monopolistic model to \nthe  postreform  unbundled  model  without  any  major  service  disruption  or  agitation  among \nemployees. However, in order to make its interventions more policy oriented and focused, ADB \ndecided to concentrate its assistance in the power sector on a limited number of selected entities \nand areas. The first stage reforms have all progressed satisfactorily, creating opportunities to \nwiden  and  deepen  the  reforms  as  part  of  a  second  stage.  This  stage  involves  financial \nstabilization of the sector entities created earlier, to enable improved governance of the sector \nthrough regulatory oversight, and to introduce structured competition and discipline in the sector. It \nis considered that a sector development modality, comprising a policy loan in parallel with an \ninvestment loan, will be the best instrument to achieve this end. The Program, which will be the \nfifth assistance provided by ADB in support of the reform process, is consistent with ADB's 2003 \nCountry Assistance Program for Bangladesh. \n \n29.  The Government and ADB have agreed on a framework for the restructuring of the power \nsector, which is presented in Appendix 3 (Power Sector Roadmap). The Government\u2019s proposed \ninvestment in the sector during the period FY1996\u20132006 is in the order of $6.6 billion. The \nProgram seeks to further key objectives of the reform process that will mobilize greater resources \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1998.

The \nProgram is the first mixed-modality, sector development program in Bangladesh.  \n \n7.  Policy Dialogue \n30.  ADB,  World  Bank,  JBIC,  DFID,  USAID,  and  KfW  have  all  been  involved  in  policy \ndialogue with the Government about issues in the power sector, with ADB playing the role of DP \ncoordinator. ADB has also played a major role in drawing up the reform assistance strategy of \nthe DPs. In addition, it organized coordination meetings for the power sector in 1992, 1994, \n1995, and 1996, and for the power and natural gas sectors, annual coordination meeting from \n1997. ADB-led aid coordination meetings in December 1992, December 1994, and September \n1995 contributed to the formulation of reforms and identification of reform-linked projects in the \nsector. ADB also provided TAs to review electricity legislation,14 prepare a power system master \nplan (footnote 4), upgrade the financial management of BPDB and DESA (footnote 12), seek \nprivate  sector  implementation  of  the  Meghnaghat  Project  (footnote  6),  and  corporatize  the \nAshuganj Power Station of BPDB.15 ADB has been instrumental in assisting the Government to \ndraw up a plan for the planned transformation of the sector, as well as the creation of new sector \nentities. \n \n31.  The medium-term goals of the policy dialogue with the Government up to 2005 and the \nresults achieved so far are summarized in the roadmap in Appendix 3. Generation is no longer a \nmonopoly and has significant private sector interest, and the public sector stations are starting \nto  be  corporatized  and  commercialized.  The  transmission  function  of  BPDB  has  been \nsegregated and corporatized. Distribution is being corporatized in the Dhaka area as well as in \nthe southwest zone, and the private sector PBSs have increased their share of sales from 13% \nin FY1993 to 35% in FY2003. Further corporatization will be carried out in the northwest zone \nas part of the proposed Program. Average retail power tariffs were increased by about 15% (in \nSeptember and December 1996), and an interim formula for semiannual adjustment of retail \npower tariffs to take into account fluctuations in fuel costs and foreign exchange rates has been \nsuccessfully implemented.16 On the regulatory side, work has progressed through the creation \nof the Power Cell. The recently approved  ERC Bill will form the basis for regulation of the \nunbundled sector. \n \n8.  Aid Coordination \n32.  Aid coordination in the sector has been intensive since the start of the reform process. \nThe DPs hold a formal coordination meeting every year where sector policies and achievements \nare reviewed by headquarters staff, and over the last year the DPs have introduced quarterly \nmeetings at the Resident Mission level to monitor progress. Informal views are also exchanged \nbetween  ADB  missions  that  visit  Dhaka  and  the  resident  missions/offices  of  other  DPs \nwhenever possible. Regular visits by senior ADB staff to Washington, DC, and by World Bank \nstaff to Manila, have also ensured that there is full exchange of views between the World Bank \nand ADB. Aide-m\u00e9moires of ADB missions are shared with all DPs, and points of specific \nconcern to any DP are discussed by email and telephone. \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1992.

During  the  last  coordination  meeting  in  August  2003,  all  involved  DPs  fully \nacknowledged the positive progress that the sector has achieved during the last decade of \nsupport by ADB. \n \n34.  The Project has been extensively discussed between ADB and the other DPs and is \nsupported by the World Bank, JBIC, KfW, NORAD, and DFID. NORAD and NDF will most likely \ncofinance the Project. KfW has also been in constant dialogue with the Government in support \nof the liquidation of the Government's dues to BPDB and DESA.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n35.  The objective of the Program is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to reform the power \nsector through financial restructuring of two major companies and to prepare for long-term \nsustainability of the sector. Especially, the Program will assist the Government in (i) providing \nsupport and incentives for sector reform activities such as independent tariff setting, competitive \ndispatch of generation, and functional segregation of sector activities; (ii) promoting the Power \nGrid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) and the Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO) as \ncommercially viable companies that can access capital markets for at least a part of their future \ncapital  needs;  and  (iii) modernizing  and  upgrading  distribution  systems  in  northwest \nBangladesh. The Project components are linked to the ongoing power sector reforms and will \n(i) expand peak load generation capacity to reduce load shedding, (ii) introduce competition in \ngeneration, (iii) enhance network reliability, (iv) increase access to electricity services in urban \nareas of northwest of Bangladesh, and (iv) improve efficiency and financial viability including \nfurther corporatization BPDB\u2019s generation and distribution. The entire exercise is geared to \nimproving the power sector\u2019s financial and economic viability over the next  5 years, and to \nenhance sector oversight and governance, thereby providing an assurance of sustained growth \nin the sector. Appendix 4 shows the program framework. \n \nB.  Special Features \n36.  PGCB  will  seek  commercial  cofinancing  through  the  issue  of  Tk2,000 million \n($34.2 million) in long-term tax-free bonds for financing the local currency costs of the NLDC. \nDiscussions with commercial banks have already been initiated by ADB in cooperation with the \nmanagement  of  PGCB.  If  the  bonds  are  successfully  raised,  this  will  be  the  first  direct \ncommercial borrowing by the public part of the power sector. Utilities cannot be financially self-\nsustaining without a long-term bond market. Currently, there is no bond market in Bangladesh, \nand it is the Government\u2019s desire that such a market be developed, since raising capital through \nbonds reduces the requirement of the Government to finance the sector. Since this is a \ndevelopmental effort and also helps the Government\u2019s finances, the Government has indicated \nits willingness to accord tax-free status to this bond issue. \n \nC.  The Program Loan \n1.  Objectives \n37.  The objective of the Program is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to (i) reform the \npower sector through the restructuring of two major transmission and distribution companies \nand  (ii) prepare  the  sector  for  long-term  financial  sustainability,  gradually  relieving  the \nGovernment of financial support for the sector.  ", "12   \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n38.  The program loan comprises support for restructuring the finances of PGCB, DESCO, and \npartially BPDB and DESA, by settlement of the outstanding dues of the Government, and its semi-\nautonomous and autonomous bodies, to DESCO, DESA, BPDB, and REB, subject to policy \ninitiatives  by  the  Government  concerning  tariffs,  competitive  generation,  and  independent \nregulation. PGCB and DESCO, as the first power sector companies, have for the last year been \nable to make a financial turnaround of their daily operations. Now that they are finally established \nas sound and long-term viable companies, the inherited financial constraints and their impact on \nthe balance sheets need to be addressed.  \n \n39.  A diagrammatic description of the dues owed by the Government and its bodies to each \nsector agency, the interagency debts, and the debts owed by agencies to the Government is \ngiven in Appendix 5. \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n40.  The Government has requested a loan of $100.0 million from ADB's ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-\nend fee of 0.5% (the front-end fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n4.  Counterpart Funds \n41.  The counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the policy loan will be used \nto  finance  the  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the  Program,  including  settlement  of \noutstanding arrears of BPDB, DESA, DESCO, and REB, due from the Government and its \nsemi-autonomous/autonomous bodies; payoff of DESCO\u2019s accumulated losses in Mirpur; and \nfor establishing DESCO\u2019s base working capital for turnaround of the Gulshan circle of DESA \nafter its transfer.  \n \nTable 4: Estimated Public Sector Arrears as of 30 June 2002 \n \nDefaulting Agencies  Amount ($) \nMinistries  56.8 \nClosed-Down State-Owned Enterprises  48.3 \nRunning Semi-Autonomous and Autonomous bodies  68.4 \nTotal Owed to the Power Sector  173.5 \n   Source: Accounts of the concerned power sector entities. \n \n42.  The Government of Bangladesh is expected to incur adjustment costs  over the reform \nperiod to recover and/or adjust outstanding dues of the Government and its semi-autonomous \nand autonomous bodies amounting to about Tk10,300 million ($173.5 million). \n ", "    13 \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Program Management \n43.  For the program loan, the borrower will be the Government and the EAs will be the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  the  Ministry  of  Power,  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  of  the \nGovernment. These two ministries will be the overall coordinators of the Program. \n \nb.  Procurement and Disbursement \n44.  The proceeds of the policy loan will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding local \ntaxes and duties) of items, preferably procured for the power sector, produced in, and procured \nfrom ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the negative list in Appendix 6 and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \n45.  In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedure \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the program loan will be \ndisbursed to the Government as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired. Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of certification provided by the Borrower, \nconfirming that in each year which policy loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value \nof  total  imports  minus  (i) imports  from  nonmember  countries,  (ii) ineligible  imports,  and \n(iii) imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the \namount expected to be disbursed during the year. The Government will open an account (the \ndeposit account) at Bangladesh Bank into which the proceeds of the loans will be deposited and \nfrom which all withdrawals will be made. The Government will, however, certify with each \nwithdrawal request its compliance with this formula. Otherwise, import documentation under \nexisting procedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds \nand verify the accuracy of government certification. Loan proceeds may be used to finance \neligible  imports  for  which  expenditures  were  incurred  180  days  before  the  loan  became \neffective. However, retroactive financing is limited to 20% of the policy loan amount. Monthly \nstatements of the deposit account will be attached to the semiannual report of the policy loan. \n \n46.  The loan will be released in two tranches and made available as follows: First tranche of \n$50.0 million17 on fulfillment of the following: \n \n(i)  The Government shall have settled at least $90 million of accumulated and \noutstanding dues for the period up to and including 30 June 2002 for supply of \nelectricity to the Government or to any of the Government\u2019s closed-down state-\nowned  enterprises.  In  settling  such  liabilities,  the  Government  may  use  a \ncombination of (a) cash payments and (b) accounting adjustments against debt \nservice liabilities that may have accrued to power sector entities against the \nGovernment. \n \n(ii)  The Government shall cause DESA to more systematically and actively pursue \ncollection of DESA's all unrecovered accounts receivables relating to the supply \nof electricity through its erstwhile Mirpur division in accordance with procedures \nto be agreed with ADB. \n \n                                                 \n17 Including front-end fee of $0.5 million. ", "14   \n(iii)  The  Government  shall  have  taken  all  necessary  steps  to  render  the  ERC \noperational. The Government shall further have caused the appointment of at \nleast three commissioners to the ERC pursuant to the rules and regulations for \nsuch appointments as set forth in the ERC Act 2003. \n \n(iv)  The Government shall have caused (a) the adoption on a pilot basis of a \u201cgrid \ncode\u201d for the power sector and (b) issuance by the relevant authorities of the \nGovernment of a notification of such adoption of a \u201cgrid code\u201d acceptable to ADB. \n \n(v)  The relevant authorities of the Government shall have caused the adoption of a \ncompetitive regime for dispatch of electricity on the basis of incremental cost per \nunit of generation of electricity and shall have granted approval to PGCB to \nexercise such a regime (cooperative pool) for its dispatch, all in accordance with \nterms acceptable to ADB. For avoidance of doubt, in such a competitive regime \nfor dispatch of electricity, the capital cost of an electricity generation plant shall \nbe  recovered  on  a  fixed  basis  whereas  the  incremental  cost  of  electricity \ngeneration  per  unit  shall  be  recovered  on  the  basis  of  actual  dispatch  of \nelectricity. \n \n(vi)  The  relevant  authorities  of  the  Government  shall  have  adopted  and \noperationalized a new regime for transmission billing in accordance with terms \nand procedures agreed with ADB. The new billing regime to be  adopted and \noperationalized  by  the  Government  shall  require  billable  amounts  to  be \nseparated by (a) energy purchased from BPDB and (b) charges for transmission \nservices  rendered  by  PGCB,  resulting  in  distribution  companies  paying  two \nseparate bills, one to BPDB for the cost of energy purchased and the other to \nPGCB for the cost of transmission services rendered. \n \n(vii)  The Government and its various regulatory agencies, as appropriate, shall have \ngranted all required approvals for PGCB to issue 7\u201310-year, tax-free bonds of up \nto Tk2,000 million in one or more tranches to finance local currency costs of \nconstructional equipment of the NLDC to be carried out by PGCB under this \nProgram.  \n \n47.  Second tranche of $50 million on fulfillment of the following: \n \n(i)  The Government shall have settled payment of all accumulated and outstanding \ndues for supply of electricity for the period up to and including 31 December to \nthe  Government  and  to  any  of  its  closed-down  state-owned  enterprises.  In \nsettling  such  liabilities,  the  Government  may  use  a  combination  of  (i)  cash \npayments and (ii) accounting adjustments against debt service liabilities that may \naccrued to the relevant power sector entities against the Government. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  shall  cause  its  current  operating  autonomous  and  semi-\nautonomous bodies to settle all accumulated and outstanding dues for supply of \nelectricity to them up to and including 31 December 2003. In cases where any \nsuch entity fails to fully settle its dues to the relevant power sector entity or \nentities by the agreed upon date, the Government shall settle all such dues, \nusing a combination of (i) cash payments and (ii) accounting adjustments against \ndebt service liabilities that may have accrued to such power sector entities \nagainst the Government. Any amount of dues settled by the Government in such ", "    15 \nmanner shall be considered as loan extended by the Government to the relevant \nnon-paying autonomous or semi-autonomous body as the case may be. \n \n(iii)  The Government shall have appointed an independent auditor acceptable to \nADB for undertaking a comprehensive investigation of the nature, causes, and \nextent of past unrecovered losses in DESA and other power sector entities due \nto  nonpayment  of  electricity  supply  bills  by  nonpublic  customers.  Such  an \nindependent  auditor  shall  carry  out  its  tasks  in  accordance  with  terms  of \nreference agreed between the Government and ADB and report in detail on, \namong other things, (a) policies and practices that have in the past resulted in \nfailure of power sector entities to collect payments for provision of electricity; \n(b) recommend  mechanisms  through  which  the  Government  through  its  own \ninstruments or through third-party private mechanisms (such as collection action \nby  designated  banks  or  other  financial  institutions)  may  launch  efforts  in \nrecovering all or at least a part of such unrecovered past dues for electricity \nsupply; and (c) recommend strategies for mitigating future losses, including ways \nof improving and preserving records on defaulters and the extent of default \namounts  that  expedite  any  required  recovery  action  in  the  future.  The \nGovernment shall have agreed to present the report of such independent auditor \nto ADB and to release the full report to the public within 6 months of the release \nof the second tranche. \n \n(iv)  To the extent that in spite of the renewed efforts by DESA at collection of \nunrecovered accounts receivables as contemplated in para. 45(ii) above, there \nremains as of the date of the second tranche, an uncollected balance of accounts \nreceivables for the period prior to 1 September 1998, the Ministry of Finance and \nBPDB shall cause a shareholders' unconditional loss contribution to DESA in an \namount equal to such unrecovered accounts receivables. \n \n(v)  To the extent that there is a shortfall (as calculated by determining profit after \ndepreciation) in the first year of DESCO\u2019s operations of the Gulshan circle, the \nMinistry of Finance and DESA shall provide additional cash support to DESCO to \ncover such shortfalls in DESCO\u2019s finances by way of enabling it to effect a \ncomplete financial turnaround of the Gulshan circle. \n \n(vi)  The Government shall cause the reorganization of BPDB, DESA, and BPDB\u2019s \nnorthwest  zone  distribution  network  and  Siddhirganj  power  station  into \nindependent corporate bodies incorporated under the Companies Act 1994, as \namended.  The  Government  shall  further  ensure  that  each  such  entity  is \nconstituted in accordance with principles and procedures acceptable to ADB, \nprovided however, that at least 50% of the membership of the board of directors \nof each such entity shall be persons who are neither current employees, nor \nhave they been employees in the preceding 3 years of the Government or any of \nits public or semi-public organizations. At least 25% of all board members of \neach of the companies shall be representatives of independent consumer or \nprofessional interests. \n \n(vii)  DESCO and PGCB shall have filed their first tariff applications to the  ERC, \nestablished under the ERC Act 2003, and the Government shall have agreed in \nwriting to cause the ERC to process all such  applications within 3 months of \nreceipt of the subject applications. ", "16   \n \n(viii)  Subject to receipt of bids deemed credible on the basis of evaluation criteria \nagreed with ADB beforehand, the Government shall have awarded a contract on \na  build-own-operate  basis  for  the  Meghnaghat-2  Project  with  a  generating \ncapacity of equal or more than 450 MW, unless otherwise agreed with ADB. \n \nD.  The Project Loan \n1.  Objectives \n48.  The objective of the Project is to improve the quality of the electricity supply and this will \nbe achieved by (i) improved supply of electricity, reduced load shedding, and balancing the \nnational grid regarding supply/demand through construction of about 200 MW peak load power \ngeneration capacity; (ii) support and incentives for further sector reform activities such as \nindependent tariff setting, competitive and optimized dispatch of generation, and functional \nsegregation of sector activities, through investment in an NLDC; and (iii) improved access to \npower supply in the relatively underdeveloped northwest region of Bangladesh.  \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n49.  The project loan includes funding for the following components: \n \nPart A -  2  x  100 MW  peaking  power  generation  capacity  at  Siddhirganj,  near \nDhaka; \nPart B -   the NLDC at Rampura in Dhaka; and \nPart C -   renovation, upgrading, and extension of distribution in Rajshahi, Serajgonj, \nBogra, Pabna, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Joypurhat, Thakurgaon, Nilphamari, and \nGaibanda towns in northwest Bangladesh. \n \n50.  Electricity  demand  in  Bangladesh  is  mainly  from  the  residential  sector  and \nconsequentially there are sharp peaks in the demand for electricity between 9 am and 1 pm, \nand between 6 pm and 10 pm each day, the evening peak being greater than the morning one. \nAt present, these peaks are met either by load shedding or by the use of base load units, which \nare  inappropriate  to  serve  these  types  of  loads  leading  to  higher  fuel  costs  and  greater \nmaintenance requirements for the machines. \n \n51.  The Power System Master Plan (PSMP) of 1995 (footnote 4) developed a least-cost \ngeneration addition plan up to 2015. This plan includes a mix of base load and peak load plants, \ncorresponding  to  the  electricity  demand  characteristics  of  Bangladesh.  The  PSMP \nrecommended installing 800 MW peaking power plants  by  2005.  As part of the plan, 2 x \n100 MW open-cycle gas turbine generating units are proposed as Part A of the Project to be \ninstalled within existing Siddhirganj power station complex, which is close to a major load \ncenter. The proposed plant will meet electricity demand of the country especially in the Dhaka \narea during peak hours, which will address the low voltage problem and improve system \nreliability. The proposed gas turbine plant will be built virtually as a replacement of the old \ninefficient power plants (after dismantling 3 x 10 MW steam plants and the 1 x 50 MW steam \nplant) and there will be no adverse impact on the surrounding area. The technology for these \nunits is proven and no major risks are foreseen. The plant is designed to be fired on natural gas \nand requirement will be 3.0 million cubic feet per hour. The fuel will be supplied from the existing \nsupply system of Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company. \n ", "    17 \n52.  The plant will comprise: (i) two units of open-cycle gas turbine generating units, each \nhaving a capacity of 100 to 120 MW; (ii) two sets of unit transformers for two gas turbines; \n(iii) three sets of gas booster compressors for two gas turbines and one standby. The efficiency \nof each gas turbine generating unit will be approximately 33% at site conditions of 35 degrees \nCelsius, 1,013 bars, and 98% relative humidity. \n \n53.  In order to run the country\u2019s power transmission system, which is the responsibility of \nPGCB, in coordination with generation and distribution, it is essential to set up a computer-\ncontrolled NLDC with the modern energy management system (EMS) and supervisory control \nand data acquisition (SCADA) facility, and a fiber optic-based fast communications network. \nThis will be able to centrally control the generation, transmission, and distribution economically, \nefficiently, and securely by fixing the instantaneous generation target of a unit through analyzing \nthe present scenario of demand and availability of generation. The facilities will support PGCB \nfor the most economic dispatch of power generation. \n \n54.  The proposed Part B of the Project is to establish an NLDC at Rampura, Dhaka, \ncomprising  EMS  and  SCADA,  to  manage  the  230/132kV  electrical  power  network  and \nassociated  substations  and  power  stations.  The  proposed  Project  will  also  include  a \ncommunications system suitable for transmission of an electrical power system\u2019s data, voice, \nand control commands. The new NLDC will be of sufficient size to accommodate PGCB\u2019s \nrequirements in 2007 plus to allow for developments up to 2015. Although this will be the first \nsuch installation in Bangladesh, BPDB (Chittagong) and DESA have been exposed to a smaller \nsupervisory control and data acquisition system built under ADB-funded projects, which is \noperating successfully. However, in order to ensure that the NLDC is designed, engineered, \nconstructed,  and  operated  as  per  standards,  the  loan  includes  provision  for  hiring  an \ninternational  consulting  firm  to  help  PGCB.  Training  of  PGCB  staff  in  operation  and \nmaintenance will be provided by the supplier of the NLDC as part of its contract. \n \n55.  Currently, the size of the Bangladesh power system is about 4,700 MW, and by 2007 is \nexpected to be about 7,000 MW. The existing central load dispatch center is equipped for \nsystem monitoring only, using voice communication and is incapable of managing a large power \nsystem with several generation and distribution entities involved. It cannot take into account the \neconomic and commercial parameters and the stability needs. Private generation has already \nstarted along with that of public sector enterprises and the power system is becoming bigger \nand more complex, both technically and commercially. \n \n56.  Competitive dispatch of generation plants will reduce the cost of generation to the \nsystem. A modern facility to enable such dispatch will also help in planning for maintenance of \nthe various generation units and power system facilities, leading to greater system reliability. \nThis is essential if more private sector investments are to be introduced into the generation \nsubsector.  \n \n57.  Part C of the Project involves upgrading and extending the distribution network in \nnorthwest Bangladesh by renovating, rehabilitating, and extending the 33 kV, 11 kV, and 0.4 kV \ndistribution system in 10 towns. The objective of the Project is to improve system reliability, \nreduce system losses, connect prospective consumers, and strengthen the distribution network. \nThis is conventional technology and should not pose any technical risk to BPDB and the \nproposed North-west Zone Power Distribution Company. This support will further boost the \nrestructuring of the sector by transferring the operation of the urban distribution from BPDB to a \nnewly created company and reduce losses, including all types of commercial losses. It will also \nextend electricity supply to urban households and the commercial sector. ", "18   \n \n58.  The  main  components  of  Part  C,  distribution,  are:  (i) renovation  of  one  132/33 kV \nsubstation;  (ii) renovation  of  19  33/11 kV  substations,  (iii) installation  of  11  new  33/11 kV \nsubstations, (iv) installation of 1,562 11/0.4 kV distribution transformers having a total capacity \nof 300 megavolt-amperes (MVA), (v) installation of 10 km of 33 kV cable, (vi) installation of \n115 km new 33 kV lines, (vii) renovation of 102 km 33 kV lines, (viii) installation of 584 km of \nnew 11 kV and 0.4  kV lines, and (ix) renovation of 500 km of 11 kV and 0.4 kV lines. \n \n3.

The Government has requested a loan  of $186.0 million from ADB's ordinary capital \nresources to help finance parts A, B, and C. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% (the front-end fee \nwill be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions to be set forth in the draft \nLoan and Program Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The borrower will be the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh. The loan proceeds will be re-lent to PGCB and BPDB (and later \ntransferred to the new companies) pursuant to subsidiary loan agreements with terms and \nconditions acceptable to ADB. Relending terms to PGCB and BPDB will include a repayment \nperiod of 25 years, including a 5-year grace period, and interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum. \nThe foreign exchange risk will be assumed by PGCB and BPDB during the life of the respective \nsubsidiary loans. \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \n62.  The implementation schedule of the Project is in Appendix 8. Implementation will begin \nin December 2003 and be completed by December 2007. Direct supervision of subproject \nimplementation and monitoring of subproject operation performance will be the responsibility of \nthe EAs and the Government. BPDB and PGCB have established units that are designated to \nbe in charge of the implementation issues. The EAs will provide quarterly progress reports to \nADB covering their respective responsibilities within 30 days of the end of each quarter. ADB \nwill review the implementation and operation of the Project based on these reports and will meet \nwith the EAs and the Government semiannually to discuss project progress. ADB will also \nmonitor the overall performance of the EAs. Components procured under NDF funds will follow \nNDF\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n \na.  Procurement \n63.  Goods and related services, as well as civil works financed by ADB, will be procured \nfollowing ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. For such procurement, bid specifications will be \nprepared so as to ensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding. Contracts \nestimated to cost in excess of $500,000 for equipment and related services, and $1,000,000 for \ncivil works will be subject to international competitive bidding requirements, and supply contracts \nvalued at $500,000 or less, except small and off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000, will \nbe procured under international shopping procedures. Small and off-the-shelf items valued at less \nthan  $100,000  may  be  procured  following  direct  purchase  procedures.  To  encourage  local \nmanufacturers, suppliers, and contractors to participate in international competitive bidding, ADB\u2019s \ndomestic preference scheme may be utilized. Contract packages are listed in Appendix 9. \n \nb.  Consulting Services \n64.  International consultants (consulting firms as well as individual consultants) will assist \nPGCB, BPDB (Part A), and the new generation company for evaluation of bids  and project \nimplementation supervision (including assistance to establishing an environmental and safety unit \nfor the new power generation company) for their respective parts of the Project. They will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. In the case of consulting firms, the quality \nand cost-based selection method will be implemented. Consultants will essentially provide design ", "20   \nreview,  quality  assurance  services,  and  training.  ADB  has  agreed  to  the  request  of  the \nGovernment  to  permit  internationally  recruited  consultants  to  collaborate  with  domestic \nconsultants. Consulting services required for the NLDC are estimated at about 168 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in  SCADA  engineering, \ncommunication, and civil/structural engineering. Similarly, 136 person-months of international and \ndomestic consulting services are expected for the peak load power plant, covering expertise in \nmechanical, electrical, instrument, and civil engineering.  \n \nc.  Advance Procurement \n65.  All the EAs have sufficient expertise in procuring materials for the works entrusted to them \nunder the Project and are allowed to initiate advance  procurement action for the goods and \nconsulting services to be financed by ADB. The Government has been advised that ADB's \napproval of advance action on procurement and recruitment of consultants does not commit ADB \nto  subsequently  approve  the  Project  or  to  finance  the  recruitment  and  procurement  costs. \nRetroactive financing has not been permitted. \n \nd.  Disbursement Arrangements \n66.  Since the disbursements under the Project will be mainly for the supply of goods and \nconsulting services, ADB's commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be used for \nthe purpose. Disbursement under the loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook and with detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. \n \ne.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n67.  The EAs of the project components, BPDB, and its succession companies as well as \nPGCB and DESCO will have their annual financial statements and project accounts audited by a \nprofessional auditing firm, acceptable to ADB. They will  maintain separate accounts for the \nProject. Unaudited statements will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of the \nfinancial year and audited statements within 3 months thereafter. \n \nf.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n68.  The EAs  will  prepare  separate  progress  reports  for  their  respective  investment  and \nprogram components and submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis. The reports will provide a \nnarrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  in  the  implementation \nschedule, problems or difficulties encountered, the performance of the project implementation \nconsultants, and the work to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports will also \ninclude a summary financial account for the investment and program components, consisting of \nproject expenditures during the period year to date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review \nthe implementation and operation of the Program based on these reports and meet with the EAs \nand the Government semiannually to discuss project progress. Program completion reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 3 months of program completion.  \n \n69.  BPDB, PGCB, and the new generation and distribution companies established under this \nProgram will carry out the program performance monitoring. Performance will be evaluated on the \nbasis of performance indicators/targets stipulated in the program framework (Appendix 4). \n ", "    21 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Social Aspects \n1.  Social and Poverty Issues \n70.  Since the Program seeks to lower the costs of electricity supply and improve efficiencies \nin operation of the grid, all the electricity consumers of Bangladesh will benefit. The distribution \nupgrade and extension in the northwest part of the country will benefit the urban as well as the \nrural population in the area, both in terms of extension of services to more consumers in urban \nareas as well as in the improvement of quality of supply for both urban and rural areas. The \nprogram and project components will result in indirect social and  poverty benefits. Improved \nfinancial management through corporatization of BPDB and DESA and independent tariff rulings \nwill  benefit  all  consumer  categories.  Commercialization  will  result  in  improved  corporate \ngovernance minimizing corruption, reducing losses, and allowing the Government to realize \nsavings that could be utilized for social sectors. Construction and operation of the NLDC in \nRampura will improve load dispatch and systems availability, reduce power outages, and lower \ncosts. Dismantling of old, small, inefficient steam turbine power plants and their replacement \nwith a peak power generation plant at Siddhirganj will improve the efficiency of the power supply \nto  Dhaka  city  and  will  benefit  several  industries  in  and  around  Dhaka,  including  small \nbusinesses that cannot afford alternative emergency lighting and power supply. Environmental \nbenefits will be realized from the operation of a modern plant with appropriate monitoring \nequipment and management of environmental impacts. \n \n71.  BPDB and the new companies will improve their procedures for public interaction by \nholding regular consultations with different consumer categories. Focus group discussions were \ncarried out with different consumer groups to assess the social and poverty impacts. \n \n72.  Improvement and expansion to the distribution network in 10 towns in the northwest \nregion will bring considerable benefits in efficiency improvements to all consumers. These towns \nare  district  towns  and  the  lead  local  government  institution  is  the municipality, except for \nRajshahi,  a  divisional  town  with  a  city  corporation.  Public  sector  institutions  like  schools, \ncolleges, and hospitals are operating in all the towns. Some have a university, medical college, \nmental hospital, etc. The population of the towns is about 1.5 million and the total number of \nhouseholds is 230,314. The districts are extensions of the rural economy. Some districts are \nleading  vegetable-growing  areas  of  the  country.  Due  to  the  construction  of  the  Jamuna \nmultipurpose bridge, the patterns of the economy are changing fast. In most of the towns, a \ngradual expansion of manufacturing and services operations is apparent. These operations are \ngenerally small, such as light engineering units, flower and rice mills, poultry feeders, bakeries, \nweaving and twisting mills, etc. Cold storage is also gradually increasing. Women work as the \nfront line workers in many of the units in all towns. \n \n73.  The power supply situation in all 10 towns is similar. The inadequacy in distribution \ncapacity causes frequent power disruptions, particularly in summer. Almost all the towns face \nlow voltage problems. The Project aims to enhance the power distribution capacity in the 10 \ntowns by renovation of existing network as well as installing new facilities. \n \n74.  Improvements are expected in the following areas: (i) all consumers will receive reliable \nand improved quality power supply, (ii) production of commercial and industrial operations will \nbe smooth, (iii) low voltage problems will improve, and (iv) replacing old lines with insulated \nones will improve safety. Electricity will be supplied to any group that requests new connection ", "22   \nor increased supply. Estimated incremental energy supply would be 8,500 GWh during 2007\u2013\n2013. \n \n75.  The improvement in the power distribution system will benefit all, including poor, women \nand children. In the commercial category, most of the consumers in the towns utilize between \n100 and 120 kWh, indicating that they operate small businesses and shops. The improvement \nwill have a remarkable impact on the growth of cottage industries and enterprises that depend \non electricity for lighting as well as production. Expansion of employment opportunities and \npoverty reduction is envisaged. Increased income and employment opportunities for the poor \nare expected through a stable power supply leading to stability in manufacturing/services \nprocesses and increased productivity of the enterprises. Women\u2019s self-employment initiatives, \nleading to additional earning, will be facilitated. \n \n76.  An indirect, but significant positive human development impact is envisaged through \navailability of light for education, improved water supply, diagnostic and health services, etc. \nChildren  and  students  will  benefit  from  longer  study  hours,  information  technology-based \nlearning,  and  communications  opportunities.  Improved  recreational  facilities  and  better \nmunicipal services are expected, resulting from improved power supply. Rural areas will also \nhave a similar positive impact through improved power supply through the PBSs. Intensity of \nland use under electrically operated irrigation equipment will increase, leading to additional \nemployment opportunities. The operational cost for all equipment and lights will be lower than \nthose operated by diesel and kerosene. It is envisaged that the power distribution project for the \n10 towns will have a positive impact not only in the project towns but also in the adjoining rural \nareas. In general, rural electrification has far-reaching social and poverty impacts will benefit \nfrom this Program, since the quality of supply to the rural areas of the northwest will improve as \na result of the distribution upgrade. \n \n2.  Resettlement \n77.  The NLDC at Rampura and the new peak power generation plant at Siddhirganj do not \nrequire land acquisition. Both will be set up on existing sites already owned and managed by \nBPDB and PGCB.  \n \n78.  Part C of the Project requires a total of 4.5 acres distributed over 10 towns with the \nmaximum  land  requirement  at  any  site  not  to  exceed  0.5  acre.  The  land  is  required  for \nconstruction of 33/11 kV substations. BPDB explored possibilities to minimize land acquisition \nand four towns lowered their original land requirements from one acre to half an acre. BPDB \nhas provided written confirmation that government land, free of encumbrances, will be used, \nand that, if needed, private land will be purchased through tender or direct negotiation. There \nwill be no compulsory land acquisition. ADB will review land procurement procedures during \nloan review missions. \n \nB.  Financial Aspects \n79.  The financial evaluation of the Program was carried out in real terms using constant \n2003 prices covering the three project loan components independently. Incremental costs and \nbenefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of the EAs under with- and without-\nproject scenarios. All parts show a robust financial internal rate of return (FIRR).  \n \n80.  For Part A of the Project, the peak load power plant station, the tariff is computed based \non current methods of tariff setting for this kind of power plant, demanding a rate of return on ", "    23 \nincremental assets of at least 10%. On this basis, the resulting revenue tariff is Tk4.34 (7.36 US \ncents) per kWh, which is normal for a peak load power station. Including the 4% minimum rate \ntest, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated at 4.63% for this part. \n \n81.  Likewise, for Part B of the Project, the revenues of the NLDC are computed based on an \nexpected rate of return on incremental assets of at least 10%, which is the current method of \nsetting the wheeling charges for the transmission grid. In achieving a return of at least 10%, an \nincrease of Tk0.027 per kWh in transmission charges during 2008, the first revenue generation \nyear, has been assumed. Including the 4% minimum rate test, the WACC is estimated at 4.4% \nfor this part. \n \n82.  For Part C of the Project, renovation and upgrading of the distribution in the northwest of \nBangladesh, the FIRR is estimated at 26%. The WACC, including the 4% minimum rate test, is \n4.79%. \n \n83.  Sensitivity analyses for the three components found comfortable switching values for \nincreases in capital costs and energy input prices, reduction in benefits, as well as a worst-case \nscenario of a combination of these. From a financial point of view, all three project components \nare  robust  and  comfortably  above  the  respective  WACC.  Detailed  financial  analyses  are \npresented in Appendix 10. \n \nC.  Economic Aspects \n84.  All components of the Program will result in increased and efficient supply of electricity \nto consumers. For this Program, the economic analysis has been carried out for the investment \nportion (i) peak load power plant, (ii) NLDC, and (iii) the distribution network in 10 towns, only. \nAs the program component is financial restructuring of DESCO, PGCB, and other power sector \nentities, it has not been considered in the economic analysis. \n \n85.  The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the peak load power plant was \nestimated at 20.2%, for the NLDC, 24.0%, and for the distribution network in 10 towns, 38.7%. \nThe combined EIRR for all three components was estimated at 29.1%. \n \n86.  Sensitivity analyses for the three components found comfortable switching values for \nincreases in capital costs and energy input prices, reduction in benefits, change in curvature \nfactors, as well as a worst-case scenario for a combination of all these aspects. From an \neconomic point of view, the Program is robust. Detailed economic analysis is presented in \nAppendix 11. \n \nD.  Environmental Aspects \n87.  The  reforms  as  part  of  the  policy  component  are  mainly  focused  on  financial \nrestructuring aspects, and therefore no potential environmental impact of the policy loan exists. \nHowever,  there  is  an  opportunity  to  establish  an  institutional  arrangement  for  handling \nenvironmental and safety issues within the corporatized BPDB. The environmental consultant \nwill be hired to identify the tasks and responsibilities of the unit and conduct training to prepare \nthe power plant to operate in an environmentally acceptable manner. \n \n88.  The  investment  component,  which  includes  dismantling  of  old,  inefficient,  power \ngenerating  units  at  Siddhirganj  is  not  expected  to  generate  any  significant environmental \nimpacts. During the construction stage, the dismantling and disposal of old machineries that ", "24   \nhave been used for a long time have to be carried out in accordance with good practices. The \nfollowing mitigation measures need to be adopted: (i) all the old machinery will be washed, to \nclean it of oil content inside the project area, and the waste water has to meet effluent standards \nbefore disposing of it into a water body; (ii) the waste oil will only be sold to parties authorized \nby the Government for recycling, or reuse of waste oil; (iii) only clean scrap will be sold to the \nmarket. Although the operation of the new power plant will contribute to improving Dhaka\u2019s air \nquality,  it  is  necessary  to  undertake  environmental  monitoring  in  accordance  with  the \nBangladesh Environmental Conservation Act and Rules, to ensure that all emissions, effluents, \nand noise will meet the existing environmental standards of Bangladesh. \n \n89.  The expansion of the distribution system is not expected to generate any significant \nimpact, either during construction or operation. However, the location of the substations will \nneed to be selected carefully to avoid noise disturbance to neighboring schools, clinics, etc. \nFurthermore, it is also required that only transformers free of Poly Chlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) \nwill be installed and that all cooling equipment should be free of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). \n \nE.  Risks \n90.  The success of the Program partially depends on the successful creation of the new \npower  generation  company  and  the  North-west  Zone  Power  Distribution  Company,  and \nrecruitment of their management. The sector has comprehensive experience in setting up new \ncompanies  under  the  Companies  Act  from  previous  projects.  Furthermore,  based  on  the \nongoing successful restructuring of the sector, advertised managerial positions have been very \nattractive in the market. Hence, there have been a lot of applications from highly qualified \nprofessionals for these positions.  \n \n91.  One major constraint might be the Government\u2019s compliance with the settlement of its \noutstanding dues to the sector and the recruitment of competent regulators for the ERC. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n92.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA.  General \n93.  The Government shall ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken, as described \nin the policy letter and the policy matrix, continue in effect for the duration of the program period. \n \n94.

Specifically, the \nGovernment will not intervene, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of policies or \nactions of the sector entities, including their organizational structure, recruitment of \npersonnel,  procurement  decisions,  or  actions  regarding  of  their  respective ", "    25 \noperational,  financial,  and  commercial  responsibilities.  The  Government  shall \nfurther refrain from taking any action, directly or indirectly, that inhibits, curbs, or \notherwise limits the independence of such entities.  \n \n(ii)  The Government shall ensure that within 6 months of the effective date, each of \nSiddhirganj  Power  Station  Company  and  North-west  Zone  Power  Distribution \nCompany are incorporated under the Companies Act 1994, as amended. The \nGovernment shall further ensure that the boards of directors of each of Siddhirganj \nPower Station Company and North-west Zone Power Distribution Company are \nconstituted in accordance with principles and procedures acceptable to ADB, \nprovided that at least 50% of members of all such boards shall be persons who are \nneither current employees nor have been employees in the preceding 3 years of \nthe Government or any public or semi-public sector organization. At least 25% of \nall board members of each of the entities shall be representatives of independent \nconsumer or professional interests. \n \n(ii)  The Government and its agencies shall expedite or assist in expedition of the \nissuance of required permits and licenses for formation and operation of BPDB\u2019s \nand DESA\u2019s successor entities.  \n \n95.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  all  local  currency  funds  required  for  the \nimplementation of the Program are allocated and made available to the appropriate entities in a \ntimely manner.  \n \n96.  In the event that PGCB is unable for any reason to successfully raise all or any part of \nthe sum of Tk2,000 million through issuance of commercial bonds within 2 years of the effective \ndate  as  presently  contemplated,  the  Government  shall  make  appropriate  budgetary \narrangements  to  fund  PGCB  under  customary  terms  and  conditions  an  amount  of  up  to \nTk2,000 million that PGCB is unable to raise through such bond issuances. \n  \n97.  The Government will assist in expediting issue of  due permits and licenses for the \neffective implementation of the Program as may be required by law. \n \n98.  The  Government,  as  the  principal  shareholder,  shall  ensure  that  each  of  PGCB, \nDESCO, and the new power sector companies established pursuant to the terms of this \nProgram comply at all times with the following financial covenants: (i) debt service coverage \nratio of not less than 1.2; (ii) rate of return on equity after tax not less than 10%; (iii) rate of \nreturn on net fixed assets not less that 5%; (iv) debt-equity ratio not exceeding 70:30; and \n(v) accounts receivables not more than 2 months billing. \n \n99.  The Government shall ensure that the vendor\u2019s agreement dated 30 December 2002 \nbetween BPDB and PGCB regarding transfer of BPDB assets to PGCB shall be revised (i) to \nvalue the assets transferred at their historical value minus accumulated depreciations and (ii) to \nprovide for the purchase of such transferred assets through (a) a loan on customary terms and \nconditions from BPDB to PGCB in an amount that is equivalent to 70% of the value of such \nassets as determined by (i) immediately above and (b) increased equity of BPDB in PGCB in an \namount equal to 30% of the value of such assets as determined by (i) immediately above. No \naccrued debt service charges and interest before the actual transfer of assets should be \ntransferred to PGCB. \n ", "26   \n100.  The  Government  shall  cause  each  of  the  program  EAs  to  carry  out  performance \nmonitoring and reviews during program implementation, to evaluate the scope, implementation \narrangements,  benefit  monitoring,  progress,  and  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  their \nrespective  components  of  the  Program,  with  due  participation  of  nongovernment  and \ncommunity-based  organizations,  all  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance \nmanagement  system  guidelines.  These  reviews  shall  include  verification  of  (i) numbers  of \nadditional connections provided; (ii) the consumer categories of the new connections; (iii) the \nimprovements in service for existing consumers in the program  area;  and  (iv) institutional \nparameters such as accounts receivables and accounts payables, and system losses. \n \nB.  Land and Resettlement \n101.  The Government shall ensure that all land, rights in land, or rights of way obtained for \nthe  program  are  either  (a) government-owned  land  that  is  free  of  liens  or  any  other \nencumbrances or (b) private land that is purchased through arms-length negotiations. In no \nevent shall such land be acquired through any compulsory land acquisition procedures. \n \n102.  Although no land acquisition or land clearing activity is currently anticipated for the \nexecution of the Program, in the event such activity becomes necessary, the Government will \nprepare a resettlement plan in full compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy and \nsubmit it to ADB for approval prior to any action on such matters. \n \nC.  Social Protection \n103.  The Government shall cause the EAs to require contracts for all civil works contractors \nto provide information at worksites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS \nas part of the health and safety measures of those employed during construction. \n \n104.  The  Government  shall  cause  each  of  the  EAs  to  ensure  that  all  program-related \nactivities are carried out in compliance with all applicable labor laws and regulations, including \nequal pay for equal work, and that no child labor is employed in any program-related work. \n \nD.

The  Government  shall  cause  the  EAs  to  ensure,  with  respect  to  their  respective \ncomponents, that the environmental mitigation measures identified in the initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  are  incorporated  and  followed  during  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance of program facilities.  \n \n106.  The Government shall ensure that the EAs implement their respective components in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines, 2003 and ADB\u2019s Environment \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects, 1993, as amended. \n \n107.  The Government shall cause BPDB to establish in its reorganized corporate structure a \nspecial unit dedicated to handling environmental and safety issues. \n \n108.  The Government shall cause the EAs to adopt provisions in relevant contract documents \nrequiring contractors implementing any aspect of the Program to adopt mitigation measures to \nminimize  adverse  environmental  impacts  during  dismantling  and  removal  of  plant  and \nequipment as well as during construction of facilities. \n ", "    27 \n109.  The Government shall ensure that the EAs routinely  monitor and at least once a year \nassess  and  document  the  Program\u2019s  compliance  with  the  Bangladesh  Environmental \nConservation Act 1995 and Bangladesh Environmental Conservation Rules 1997. \n \n110.  The Government shall ensure that BPDB or its successor  entity, Siddhirganj Power \nStation Company, shall not commence any construction related to Siddhirganj power plant as \ncontemplated under this Program until after obtaining all due clearances and approvals from the \nGovernment\u2019s Department  of  Environment.  The  Government  shall  further  ensure  that  the \nDepartment  of  Environment  holds  all  required  public  consultations  prior  to  granting  such \nclearances or approvals. \n \nE.

The power sector in Bangladesh is organized under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral \nResources. The Government, through the ministry, wholly owns and supervises the Bangladesh \nPower Development Board (BPDB), the Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA), and the Rural \nElectrification Board (REB), which are its three executing agencies in the sector. Until fiscal year \n(FY) 1998, BPDB was responsible for all generation and most of the transmission in the country, \nand also for distribution in district towns, municipalities, and some rural areas, while DESA was \nresponsible for distribution in the greater Dhaka area, including the capital city. The distribution of \nelectricity in most of the rural areas of Bangladesh is the responsibility of the 67 rural electric \ncooperatives or palli bidyut samities (PBSs), which are organized, initially funded, and monitored \nby REB. As part of the sector reform process, new public sector entities such as the Power Grid \nCompany of Bangladesh Ltd. (PGCB) and the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd. (DESCO) \nas  well  as  private  sector  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  such  as  the  Rural  Power \nCompany Ltd. (RPC),1 the Meghnaghat AES Power Company Ltd.,2 and the Haripur AES Power \nCompany Ltd. have been constituted. Over the next few years, these companies will own and \noperate a substantial part of the power sector\u2019s assets. The distribution subsector has also seen \na major rationalization of distribution territory between DESA and the PBSs. The Government, \nBPDB, and REB have taken steps to involve the private sector by (i) adopting a private power \ngeneration policy in October 1996, (ii) adopting a small power generation policy in 1998 to \nencourage distributed generation, and (iii) awarding contracts for about 1,800 megawatts (MW) \nof generating capacity on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. \n \n2.  After DESCO became operational in 1998, and distribution territory between DESA and \nthe PBSs was rationalized, the sector\u2019s operational and financial situation improved (Table \nA1.1).  \n \nTable A1.1: Performance of the Power Sector, FY1998 and FY2002 \n \n  Distribution Share  Distribution Losses   Revenue Collections \n \n  FY1998  FY2003  (% of imports)  (% of billings) \n  GWh  %  GWh  %  FY1998  FY2003  FY1998  FY2003 \n                 \nBPDB    3,485  42    4,838    35  29.1  20.7    81    90 \nDESA    3,239  39    3,484    25  30.1  30.9    80    92 \nPBSs    1,435  17    4,888    35  16.5  17.3    96    100 \nDESCO      224a    3       681    5  46.7a  21.2     88a    88 \n                 \nTotal    8,383  100   13,891   100    27.7    23.4    82    93 \nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, DESCO = Dhaka \nElectric Supply Company, Ltd., GWh = Gigawatt-hours, PBSs = rural electric cooperatives. \na As the Mirpur Division of DESA prior to its restructuring.

It was established in 1994 as part of the policy dialogue for ADB Loan 1356-BAN(SF): \nRural Electrification Project for SDR34.4 million, approved on 30 May 1995. \n2  Supported by ADB through TA 2338-BAN: Solicitation for Private Sector Implementation of the Meghnaghat Power \nProject, for $211,000, approved on 30 May 1995 and enhanced to $595,000 in March 1998; Investment Loan  \n7165/1793-BAN: AES Meghnaghat Power Project, for $50 million loan; and 31909-BAN $70 million partial risk \nguarantee and complementary financing scheme no. 39, for $20 million, all approved on 5 December 2000. ", " 30 Appendix 1 \n \n3.  Bangladesh has limited hydropower potential because the terrain is flat. The Jamuna-\nPadma-Meghna river system, which runs north to south, divides the country into two. The \ncountry's entire proven recoverable reserves of oil (including condensate) estimated at 59 million \nbarrels, and natural gas estimated at 12 trillion cubic feet are on the eastern side of the river \nsystem. The limited hydropower potential is also in the eastern part of the country. The western \npart  has  no  developed  commercial  sources  of  energy.  Coal  reserves,  which  are  in  the \nnorthwestern part, are deep beneath the surface and difficult to develop, and only one potential \nmine with a limited output of about 1 million tons per annum is being developed, with external \nassistance. Consequently, of the country's total installed generation capacity of 4,710 MW, about \n487 MW fueled by diesel oil and heavy fuel oil and 261 MW fueled by natural gas, are in the \nwestern part. Of the 3,962 MW in the eastern part, 3,732 MW is based on natural gas, the \ncountry's primary commercial fuel, and 230 MW on hydropower. In terms of energy generated, \nabout 90% of the total in FY2003 was from gas-fired power plants.  \n \n4.  In FY2003, BPDB's average retail tariff for its ultimate consumers was Tk3.31/kilowatt-\nhours (kWh) ($0.057/kWh), DESA's was Tk2.93/kWh ($0.051/kWh), DESCO\u2019s was Tk3.19/kWh \n($0.055/kWh) and PBS's Tk3.45/kWh ($0.060/kWh), leading to a weighted average tariff of \nTk3.26/kWh, ($0.056/kWh), compared with the estimated long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of \nsupply of Tk3.98/kWh ($0.068/kWh). Rationalization of the domestic tariff structure, effective 1 \nSeptember 2003, will increase unit rates at retail level substantially. The LRMC is, however, \ndeclining due to (i) the lower costs of production from the larger private sector IPPs, and (ii) \ndeclining losses. Retail tariffs are being adjusted every 6 months to reflect increased costs of \ninputs by way of (i) the increased debt service burden on the utilities in local currency caused by \nthe devaluation of the taka and (ii) increase in the price of natural gas. In FY2002, BPDB\u2019s \naverage cost of generation including cost of power purchased from IPPs was Tk1.84/kWh only, \nwhich has further decreased in FY2003 following commissioning of the 450 MW Meghnaghat-I \nIPP station. \n \n5.  The political unrest in the country over the last few years has significantly affected the \ncollection operations of both BPDB and DESA since many commercial establishments, including \nbanks, were closed for prolonged periods and those that were open functioned with minimal \nservices. DESA was particularly hard hit since Dhaka, as the capital city, was the center of the \nunrest, and normal life in the city was disrupted for longer periods than in other towns. During \nFY2000, the collection-to-generation ratio of BPDB and the collection-to-import ratio of DESA \nwere 65.9% and 65.1%, respectively. These were way below the targets, which were 75% for \nBPDB and 70% for DESA. In FY2001, however, with the implementation of the ADB-funded \nFinancial Management Upgrade Project,3 the collection performance of both utilities  went up \ndramatically, resulting in a collection-generation ratio of 70.8% for BPDB. DESA\u2019s performance \nremained stagnant on account of the deferred payments instituted with the PBSs that had just \ntaken over DESA\u2019s loss-incurring rural areas in FY1999. The performance of the seven PBSs \nsupported by ADB in the Rural Electrification Project (footnote 3) has been very good, with an \naverage  collection-to-import  ratio  of  over  85%.  REB\u2019s  (PBSs\u2019)  overall  collection-import \nperformance slightly deteriorated to 77.4% in FY2001 on account of the bad areas taken over \nfrom DESA. However, the trends are in the right direction and these PBSs are already contributing \npositively to the sector\u2019s financial viability in FY2002 and onward. The operational performance of \nBPDB, DESA, REB, and DESCO over the last 10 years since the start of reforms is summarized \nin Table A1.2. \n                                                 \n3  TA 2004-BAN: Financial Management Upgrade of BPDB and DESA, for $1,000,000, approved on 26 November \n1993.

The financial evaluation of the Program was carried out in real price terms covering \nthe project loan only. The project cost estimates, projections, and financing plans were \nprepared using current prices. Investments in respect of project costs include a physical \ncontingency at the rate of 5.0% of the initial capital investment.  \n \nA.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n2.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the three project components was \ncalculated as follows. \n1.  Peak Load Power Plant  \n3.  The first component of the project is installation of the peak load power plant (gas \nturbine) at Siddhirganj, with a capacity of 200 megawatts (MW), which will run for 6 hours a \nday  at  an  estimated  availability  of  98%  to  generate  429,240  megawatt-hours  (MWh) \nannually. As it is a new gas turbine plant, and running during peak hours only, a 98% \navailability level is considered normal, keeping in view that the remaining period of the day is \nsufficient for its repair and maintenance. \n4.  The FIRR was calculated assuming fuel cost of 1.5 US cents/kilowatt-hour (kWh) and \noperation, maintenance, and administration cost at 1.0% of its capital outlay. It has been \ncalculated for a period of 17 years including 2 years of construction with a life span of 15 \nyears with no residual value. Based on ruling tariff-setting principles, demanding a return on \nincremental investments of at least 10.0%, the revenue comes out at Tk4.34 (7.36 US cents) \nper kWh, which looks normal given that it is a peak load power station. This is the prevailing \ntariff-setting principle and as such will be implemented as well. The FIRR calculations for the \npeak load power plant are given in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n2.  National Load Dispatch Center \n5.  The FIRR for the transmission component has been calculated for a period of 24 \nyears including 4 years of construction. A period of 20 years is considered normal for \nrevenue generation with the proposed capital investment.  The investment in the national \nload dispatch center will result in savings in fuel and other operational costs of generating \npower because of facilitated instant dispatch of the most economical power. However, the \noverall economic benefits in cost savings through more efficient dispatch will not result in \nany additional revenue to the executing agency, but justifies an increase of the wheeling \ncharges  for  transmission  to  cover  the  additional  investment  and  operational  costs.  In \nachieving a return of at least 10.0%, an increase of 0.027Tk/kWh in transmission charges \nduring  2008,  the  first  revenue  generation  year,  has  been  assumed.  FIRR  has  been \ncalculated with nil residual value. The FIRR calculations for the national load dispatch center \nare given in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n  3.  Distribution \n6.  This component covers the transfer of urban distribution in the northwest zone to a \nnew North-west Zone Power Distribution Company, which will take over the distribution of 10 \ntowns, namely Bogra, Dinajpur, Joypurhat, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Pabna Serajgonj, Nilphamari, \nGaibanda, and Thakurgaon. It will include the transfer of assets, liabilities, and personnel in \nrespect of these towns to the new company. At present in these towns, power is distributed \nby BPDB. \n7.  The losses in the distribution sector due to insufficient and poor control over billing \nand improper records are the major area of consideration. At present, the average total ", " 48 Appendix 10 \nlosses in the distribution grid for the 10 towns, excluding the palli bidyut samity (rural electric \ncooperatives,  PBSs),  worked  out  at  26%  approximately.  Under  this  Program,  with \ncomputerization  of  the  distribution  operations,  and  with  a  new  company  culture,  the \ndistribution losses are expected to gradually come down to 15% in the first 5 years after \nimplementation of the Program. The collection ratio should also improve to add to the \nrevenue potential of the Program. The collection ratio is anticipated to improve from 85% \npresently to 98% by the end of 2007. \n8.  Besides  the  above  potential  source  of  revenue  generation,  additional  sales  of \nelectricity to existing and new consumers will be a major source of revenue. The demand \nprojections for the coming years have been made keeping in view the current coverage in \nthese towns, and the growth trend of demand for power in Bangladesh. The revenue stream \nwas  estimated  using  these  demand  projections  and  respective  tariff  rates  for  various \ncategories of consumers. For estimating the revenue stream, the distribution to  the PBSs \nunder the Rural Electrification Board has not been considered. No tariff increase is assumed \nin the analysis. Operation, maintenance, and administrative costs have been taken as 5.0% \nof the capital investment. \n9.  The  FIRR  has  been  calculated  for  a  period  of  20  years  including  4  years  of \nconstruction. In calculating the FIRR, no residual value has been considered. The calculated \nFIRR is 26.6% as given in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nB.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n10.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has been calculated in real terms for \neach component as well as for the consolidated investment. Loans from the ordinary \ncapital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and from the Nordic Development \nFund (NDF) will be extended to the Government and an onlending interest rate of 5.0% per \nannum from the Government to the executing agencies has been taken for calculation of \nWACC, while the rate of interest for the local currency loan through commercial bonds in \nthe case of the national load dispatch center has been taken as 11.0% per annum. An \nincome tax rate of 40.0% per annum has been considered for calculations. The inflation \nrates  considered  are  2.4%  and  4.5%  for  foreign  currency  and  local  currency  loans \nrespectively. The return for the long-term capital contribution as equity has been taken as \n15.0%. \n11.  On the basis of the above, the WACC has been worked out to be 4.63% in the \ncase of the peak load power plant, 4.23% in respect of the national load dispatch center, \nand 4.81% in the case of the distribution component. The consolidated weighted cost of \ncapital is worked out to be 4.55%. \nC.  Sensitivity Analysis \n12.

The scope of this Program includes four components: \n(i)  Establishment of a peak load gas turbine at Siddhirganj to be corporatized \ntogether  with  a  base  load  power  station  of  210  megawatts  (MW),  to  be \ncommissioned shortly; \n(ii)  Setting up of a national load dispatch center (NLDC); \n(iii)  Transfer of assets, personnel, and operations from BPDB to the North-west Zone \nPower Distribution Company. The areas to be transferred are Bogra, Dinajpur, \nJoypurhat, Pabna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Serajgonj, Thakurgaon, Nilphamari, and \nGaibanda; and \n(iv)  Financial restructuring of Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd. (DESCO), Power \nGrid Company of Bangladesh Ltd. (PGCB), and partially other power sector \nentities. \n \n2.  All these components of the Program will result in increased and more efficient supply of \nelectricity to consumers. For this Program, the economic analysis has been carried out for \ncomponents (i), (ii), and (iii). As component (iv) is financial restructuring of DESCO, PGCB, and \nother power sector entities, financed through a program loan, it has not been considered in the \neconomic analysis.  \n \n3.  When an investment is made as a package for creating a generation, transmission, and \ndistribution network, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) on the investment made is \nnormally considered representative of the rate of return on the transmission and distribution \ninvestments, as they are typically only a part of the total investment. But this program includes \ninvestments in three quite independent components, i.e., a distribution network in 10 towns, an \nNLDC,  and  a  peak  load  power  plant.  Keeping  in  view  the  standalone  nature  of  these \ninvestments in the context of the existing power sector in Bangladesh, the economic analysis for \nthe three components was carried out separately. \n \n4.  For  the  purposes  of  economic  analysis,  the  estimated  capital  costs  of  the  three \ncomponents1 were broken down into tradable and nontradable goods and services. All cost \nelements were valued at border price numeraire,2 using a domestic currency with all taxes and \nduties  excluded,  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.855  for  nontraded  items,  and  a  labor \nconversion factor of 0.8 for unskilled labor and 1.1 for skilled labor. Operating costs were \ncalculated as a fixed percentage of the economic investment cost, using 5% for the distribution \ncomponent, 1.5% for the peak load power plant, and 1% for the NLDC.  \n \n5.  On  the  cost  side,  the  economic  valuation  of  the  distribution  component  includes \neconomic send-out costs of power. The economic cost of importing power for the distribution \nsystem in these 10 towns has been valued at the long-run marginal cost of generation plus the \n                                                 \n1  The peak load power plant at Siddhirganj has been planned to be built at the existing site of an obsolete power \nplant. Therefore, the costs on account of transmission lines, land, and resettlement will not arise and are thus not \nincluded in the capital cost component. Taxes, duties, and interest during construction are also excluded, while \nphysical contingency is included in the financial capital cost, to arrive at the economic capital cost. \n2 In order to bring all resource effects to a common basis so that they can be aggregated into an estimate of project \nnet benefits, domestic price numeraire has been used. This procedure has been assumed to be most suitable \nbecause a significant part of project capital and other input costs as well as project benefits are of a nontraded \nnature. \n ", "Appendix 11   51 \nwheeling  charges  for  transmission.  As  economic  analysis  of  the  distribution components \nconsiders it a standalone investment, to reflect the economic benefits that arise solely because \nof investment in this component, wheeling charges for transmission of electricity for distribution \nhave been considered as part of the economic cost of electricity to the distribution system.  \n \n6.  A period of 20 years was considered for economic analysis of distribution and NLDC \ncomponents, while in the case of the peak load power plant, its life being 15 years with 2 years \nof construction, the analysis period was also taken as 17 years. \n \nB.   Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n1.   Peak Load Power Plant \n \n7.  In  the  case  of  the  peak  load  power  plant,  the  economic  value  of  total  generated \nelectricity valued on the basis of cost of alternative sources of energy net of transmission and \ndistribution  losses  has  been  considered  in  the  economic  analysis.  Valuation  was  done \nconsidering the proportionate shares of various categories of consumers that will consume the \noutput  of  this  plant  and  the  cost  of  representative  alternative  fuels3  for  these  categories, \nrespectively. The calculated EIRR is 20.2% as presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n2.   National Load Dispatch Center \n \n8.  The investment in the NLDC will result in savings in fuel and other operational costs of \ngenerating power because of facilitated instant dispatch of the most economical power. Such \nsavings will not be reflected in the economic benefits estimated for various categories of \nconsumers, as the power tariff is regulated and does not get adjusted automatically to account \nfor the additional cost of peak load power generation. Therefore, these savings in generation \ncosts arising because of NLDC have been considered as economic benefits. These were \nestimated to be 2.0% of total electricity consumption in Bangladesh. The calculated EIRR is \n24.0% as presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n  \n3.   Distribution in 10 Towns \n \n9.  The economic analysis for the distribution component compares the economic benefits \narising on account of consumption of increased and efficient supply of electricity by three \ncategories  of  consumers,  i.e.,  domestic,  commercial,  and  industrial,  with  the  total  capital \ninvestment proposed for the system. As agricultural consumers are small in number in these 10 \ntowns, they have been put with the commercial category for simplifying calculations. The PBSs \nunder the Rural Electrification Board (REB) as a bulk consumer in the towns has been excluded \n                                                 \n3 As the project output in the case of the peak load power plant will be of a nonincremental nature, where it will \nsubstitute for alternative forms of supply, the shadow price is in terms of alternative sources of energy. Further, \nwhen load is shed during peak periods, in all likelihood consumers shift to alternative sources of energy. The logic \nmay run as follows: (i) when load is shed, the immediate decision facing the consumers is whether go without or \nthink for alternatives; (ii) rational behavior on part of consumers means looking for alternatives. They have two \nchoices\u2014either switch to alternative fuel during hours of load shedding or shift consumption to off-peak periods. \nMost likely, they will switch to alternative fuel for two reasons. First, there will be no incentive for deferred \nconsumption as such shifting will not be a saving that can be consumed in future to enhance welfare. Second, it is \nnot possible to shift total consumption of \u201cload shedding hours\u201d to off-peak periods because certain uses of \nelectricity are continuous or hour-specific in a day; for example continuous running of a refrigerator or use of an \nelectric bulb during the night; (iii) the implication of the above postulates is that consumers are most likely to switch \nto alternative sources and thus the valuation of economic benefits in terms of alternative sources of energy is quite \njustified. \n ", "52   Appendix 11 \nfrom the respective totals for these towns for two reasons. First, in the future, Bangladesh \nPower Development Board itself is supposed to supply electricity directly to REBs; second, it is \ndone to realistically estimate the savings in town distribution losses to their own customers in \nthe ten towns only. \n \n10.  Economic benefits arising out of reduced distribution losses in terms of electricity saved \nvalued at its long-run marginal cost of generation have been considered. Economic benefits \narising out of the investment in the distribution network in the 10 towns have been calculated as \nincremental and nonincremental separately. Incremental benefits are assumed to appear for two \nreasons.  First,  on  account  of  normal  average  increases  in  consumption  by  the  existing \nconsumers during the same number of hours of supply as today; and second, on account of \nreduced load shedding and breakdowns resulting in more hours of electricity supply. It is \nexpected that reduced load shedding will motivate consumers to buy and use more sensitive \nelectrical appliances, such as refrigerators (domestic consumers) and production equipment \n(industrial consumers). However, economic benefits arising out of increased demand for such \nequipment  and  likely  growth  in  an  electric  consumer  durables  industry  have  not  been \nconsidered.  \n \n11.  Incremental consumption was valued by estimating the consumer\u2019s willingness to pay for \nincremental electricity supply and adding the related consumer surplus benefits to the tariff-\nbased revenues. Nonincremental benefits were valued in terms of resource cost savings by \nconsidering  the  cost  of  representative  alternative  sources  of  energy.  Costs  of  alternative \nsources of power used by three categories of consumers were estimated. The dominant source \nof alternative energy in domestic sector is assumed to be kerosene, while for commercial and \nindustrial consumers, alternative sources of energy are assumed to be inverter batteries and \ndiesel generator sets, respectively.  \n \n12.  For reasons of convenience, usually, the relevant demand curve segment is treated as \nlinear to simplify the calculations. However, to reflect the demand price elasticity for the various \ncategories of consumers in the evaluation, only a portion of the maximum consumer surplus \nbenefits is assumed for the valuation of incremental sales. However, keeping in view the \nsubstantial quantum of economic benefits and thus robustness of the Project, the consumer \nsurplus was not included in the economic benefits. The calculated EIRR is 38.7% as presented \nin Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nC.  Conclusion \n \n13.  The EIRRs calculated for the three components reveal that project components are \nrobust. EIRRs are given in Table A14.1. \n    \nTable A11.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value of Three \nComponents, Individual and Combined, % \n  Component  Analysis  EIRR (%)  NPV (Tk \nPeriod  million \n(years) \n  Peak Load Power Plant  15  20.20  1,963 \n  National Load Dispatch Center  20  24.04  4,422 \n  Distribution Network in Ten Towns  20  38.70  4,927 \n  Combined  20  29.07  12,151 \n        EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \n        Source: ADB staff estimates. \n ", "Appendix 11   53 \n \n14.  Sensitivity analysis for the three components indicates comfortable switching values for \nincreases in capital costs and energy input prices. Sensitivity of EIRR to changes in the \ncurvature factor for the different categories of consumers as well as for changes of fuel input \nprices for selected captive generation did not lead to a significant deterioration in the EIRR. The \nresults of sensitivity analysis under  various scenarios are given in Table A14.2.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector identified as a National Priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in  Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   Country Poverty Partnership \n  Agreement?  \n \nContribution of the sector to reduce poverty: \n \nIncreased efficiency in the energy sector is an essential component for economic growth in Bangladesh. \nAccording to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) 2000, national access to power is about 31%, \nconsidered to be small and insufficient even by standards of low-income countries. In 2000, nationally, \n12% of the poorest households had electricity connections, 3% rural and 46% urban. Those who have \naccess to electricity receive poor, unreliable services with regular power outages and low voltage. \nImproved energy services are essential for the country\u2019s economic growth and other social services. \nEfficient power supply is essential for the manufacturing and service industry, particularly the micro and \nsmall industries including the garment sector which employs several million poor, particularly poor \nwomen. Agricultural production is also dependent on energy, especially electricity. Energy efficiency \nbeyond Dhaka is necessary if GOB is to meet its objectives to decentralize development away from \nDhaka to secondary towns as well as develop rural infrastructure. Bangladesh has one of the highest \npaces  of  urbanization  among  developing  countries.  The  rural-urban pull is resulting in increased \nmigration into Dhaka city.  \n \nUrbanization  has  contributed  to  the  reduction  in  national  poverty.  For  instance,  during  the  period \n1983/84 and 1991/92 there was a 5% reduction in the national head-count index. Dhaka city however \ncannot  be  the  sole  hub  that  attracts  rural  migrants.  Electricity has been instrumental in creating \nemployment opportunities for the poor in the rural and urban areas \n \nThe ongoing multi-donor support to GOB\u2019s Power Sector Reform is an indication of the importance GOB \nplaces on the sector\u2019s contribution to national development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Classification: Other  \n \nThe first block of domestic power consumption 100 KWh per month is subsidized in Bangladesh. In the \nfinancial year 2002 the highest electricity consumption was in the residential  category. Renovation, \nupgrading and extension of distribution networks will be implemented in ten towns of Rajshahi, Serajgonj, \nBogra, Pabna, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Joypurhat, Thakurgaon, Nilphamari and Gaibanda in the northwest. In \neight of the ten towns, the average domestic power consumption was less than 100 units in February \n2003 indicating that poor consumers constitute the biggest user category. Similar to the Dhaka Power \nTransmission and Distribution Project, the project can be expected to have indirect benefits on the lives of \npoor people who use small amounts of electricity and women who engage in micro-level production \nactivities (Greater Dhaka Power Transmission and Distribution Project Phases II and II A, Evaluation \nReport/EV550-1994). In all towns, domestic consumers followed by commercial and industrial customers \nare the main users. In the commercial category, in six of the ten towns, average consumption was less \nthan 100 units and in two were less than 120 units indicating that small shops and business ventures \nformed the largest group of consumers in this category. \n \nWhile the policy and investment components are not designed to have poverty impacts, they are likely to \nresult in indirect positive impacts on the poor in terms of income and employment, and public services \nsuch as health, education and municipal services. At least 170,000 new meter connections will be \nprovided to domestic and commercial users, which is expected to benefit the poor households and micro \nlevel commercial units. A total of 3,500 new connections for industrial consumers and one new 11/kv sub-\nstation in each town will be established to improve quality of supply. In addition, replacement meters will \nbe provided to all consumer categories. These demands are based on projected load demand for a \nfifteen-year period to service the needs of the towns until the year 2020. According to BPDB, the following ", " 60 Appendix 13 \nkey improvements are expected (i) all consumers will receive uninterrupted, improved electricity supply (ii) \ncommercial and industrial operations will be uninterrupted (iii) low voltage problems which are particularly \ndamaging to remote rural areas will improve and (iv) replacing old lines with insulation will improve safety. \nThe benefits will be in terms of employment, income, better supply of essential services like water, street \nlights, diagnostic and health services and cost saving for energy and maintenance of equipments with \nbetter supply of power. \n \nOn  the  policy  side,  improved  governance  which  includes,  streamlining  financial  operations,  billing \narrangements and corporatizing BPDB will result in better service to the public. The establishment of an \nindependent regulator will result in transparent and consultative procedures for issuing tariff rulings and \ndistribution services. Possible reduction in costs of products can be expected from price rationalization \nand efficiency gains. Employees will benefit from a new management structure and skills training.  \n \nOn the investment side, the new peak power generation unit to be established at Siddhirganj will provide \nregular and improved energy supply to the city of Dhaka. Considerable environment benefits, cost \nsavings  on  stand  by  generators  and  improved  efficiency  in  the  manufacturing  business,  including \ngarments, pharmaceuticals and electronics will result from the new plant. All categories of workers and \nparticularly  those  in  the  ready-made  garment  industries  are  likely  to  benefit  from  better  working \nenvironments and reduced hours of work. \n \nThe structure of the northwest regional economy is mostly agricultural with industry limited to agro \nprocessing and production for local markets. Value added from Government consumption activity is 11% \nin the region compared to 8% in Bangladesh as a whole. Pabna, and Bogra have a larger share of \nindustry (manufacturing plus construction), Also a few large-scale industries are situated in the area. \nSome service units serve the rural producers. For example, Rajshahi has 32 cold storage facilities which \nstore agricultural products of poor farmers, power outages up to eight hours cause serious loss to both \ngroups. The owners have to spend about 60% higher for stand by generators to protect their business. \nRajshahi is also the divisional headquarters with government offices and many educational institutions \nincluding a university. Sirajganj and Pabna have many power and handloom weaving and twisting \nfactories  and  provide  employment  for  the  poor.  The  largest  consumer  category  are  households. \nConsumer consultations indicate that the quality of the distribution network and low maintenance often \ncause power disruption, particularly during the summer months and during storms, almost all seven towns \nexperience disruption to the network. During the irrigation season overloading during peak hours causes \npower outages that affect all consumers.  \n \nUnstable power supply and peak period power cuts have effects on peoples\u2019 lives in various ways. Poor \nand particularly women who work as front line workers on a piece basis are severely affected by power \nloss. Low income, long working hours and sometimes bringing in children to make up lost hours is the \nresult of unstable power supply. Many electrical items brought into repair shops are damaged due to \npower interruption. Small business units such as photo studios, cyber cafes, beauty parlors, photocopy \nshops all complain of disruption to business and loss of income during the peak time. Health clinics and \ndiagnostic services are also seriously disrupted as many units become non-operational due to low voltage \nor have a shorter service life because of constant power outage. Patients are inconvenienced by having \nto wait long hours or have to return due to disruption of services. Municipal water supply, streetlights are \nalso of poor quality due to power disruption. \n \nBeneficiaries expressed the need for regular and expanded power supply. Perceived benefits from an \nimproved system include, increase in income and employment through stable production activities in \nexisting and new units. Costs, time saving and production losses could be minimized by way of reducing \ndamage to household and production equipment. Basic municipal and other services would be improved \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 13   61 \nC.

Introduction \n \n1.  The investment components of this Project include: (i) replacement of old steam power \ngeneration plant and installation of a new gas power plant (open-cycle turbine); (ii) expansion of \ndistribution line in 10 towns (11 kilovolts [kV] and 0.4 kV); and (iii) construction of a new 2,800 \nsquare meter office building for the national load dispatch center (NLDC).  \n \n2.  The investment component for the construction of the office building is not expected to \nhave a significant impact due to its location as well as the nature of the activities involved in \nconstructing the office building and in operating its office. Therefore, no initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  for  this  investment  component.  The  investment \ncomponents to replace the old generation steam plant and expansion distribution line are \nclassified as B projects in accordance with the Guidelines on Environmental Assessment of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The IEE for these two investment components was prepared. \nThis appendix is based on the information in the IEE reports submitted by the Government. \n \n3.  According to the Bangladesh\u2019s Environmental Preservation Rules 1997, the construction \nor improvement of power generation plant and replacement and expansion of power distribution \nlines fall under the \u201cred\u201d category. Any works for these types of projects can only be done after \nthe Department of Environment issues an environmental clearance. \n  \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n4.

Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Project area involved in and affected by the replacement of old  \npower plant with the new gas power plant \n \n5.  The project area is located in Siddhirgonj Power Plant Complex of Naryanngonj District \nand situated 1.5 km east of Dhaka\u2013Chittagong Highway. This power plant complex is also part \nof Siddhirgonj Industrial Area. The site is flat, and it was land filled by riverbed dredging that was \ndone in the early 1970s. The existing steam power plant is one of the power plants located in \nthis complex, where there are two other gas and steam power plants inside this power plant \ncomplex. There is no residential area near to the complex. No cultural artifacts or historical \nremains are in the vicinity (at radius 5 km). There is no environmentally sensitive area, however, \nthe complex is located about 1 km from Shitalaxma river. The river is the important source of \nwater for this industrial complex. \n   \n2.  Project Area Involved In and Affected by Distribution Lines \n \n6.  The project area will spread all over northwest zone of Bangladesh. It involves 10 towns \nand all of them are capital districts, therefore, it is characterized by a small-town type of \necosystem. There is no environmentally sensitive area involved in this subproject, and no \ncultural artifacts or historical remains are affected by the Project. All the substations (existing \nand new) are not located nearby the residential area, and none of them is located near to any \nsocial infrastructures (e.g., clinic, school).  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Replacement of the Old Steam Power Generation Plant with the New Gas \nPower Plant (open-cycle turbine)  \n \n7.  There is no significant impact expected due to the site of the Project, since the project is \nlocated within the power plant complex belonging to BPDB. The existing steam power plant, \nwhich was established in the early 1970s, is generating 50 MW of power, which is being used to \nserve Dhaka\u2019s demand.  \n \n8.  This investment component will not include any development of transmission line, since \nadequate transmission systems already are in place. Therefore, the main feature of the project \nactivities as part of construction work is dismantling of the existing building and machinery. The \nscrap machinery has an economic value, however, this machinery has been used for a long \ntime, and therefore some of it has become corrosive and most of it contains lubrication oil as \nwell as transformer oil. To mitigate any environmental impact associated with the used scrap, \nthe following mitigation measures will be adopted: (i) all the old machinery will be washed, to \nclean its oil content, inside the project area. Wastewater from washing the machinery will be \ndisposed of in the river after trapping its oil, and the oil contained in its wastewater should not \nexceed the Bangladesh Effluent Standard (10 mg/l); (ii) the waste oil will only be disposed or \nsold to the parties that are authorized by the Government to treat oil waste; and (iii) only clean \nscrap will be sold to the market. The disposal from dismantling the building will be used to fill up \nthe lower area inside the power plant complex.  \n \n9.  The  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  of  new  building  and \nmobilizing the new machinery are negligible and will only locally affect the project area, in fact \nonly within the power plant complex. There will be no dumping of construction materials outside ", " 70 Appendix 16 \nthe power plant complex. Similarly, there will be no container or car parking outside the power \nplant complex, since the complex has adequate space for parking. However, traffic approaching \nthis project area will increase, and therefore, the proponent should work with the local authority \nto reroute the traffic if necessary. \n \n10.  The environmental impacts due to the operation of the plant is expected to be positive, \nbecause the new plant will be based on CNG, which will be supplied by already existing \npipelines. No exhaust steam will be emitted. There will be no cooling wastewater to be disposed \nof in the river. The use of natural gas for power generation will generate very little material, \nwhich cannot burn, so no dust is emitted in the exhaust gases. The NO  emission has been the \nx\nsubject of extensive development work by gas turbine manufacturing and, considering the \nBangladesh CNG, it is expected that the NO  level can be reduced to 25 parts per million. \nx\nTherefore, the new power plant will clearly contribute to improving Dhaka\u2019s air quality.   \n \n2.  Expansion of Distribution Line \n  \n11.  The  screening  of  potential  impacts  identifies  that  there  will  be  no  significant \nenvironmental impact due to sitting of these distribution line and substation, because all these \nsubprojects will be carried out in the town area and mostly in the existing facilities and along the \nroads. The environmental impacts associated with the construction stage will mostly involve \ntraffic disturbance. To minimize this impact, a clear traffic sign will be placed in the construction \narea and if necessary traffic will be rerouted. Good practices during the installation of cable or \ndistribution line will be adopted and will be included in the bidding document. Therefore, it is \nclear that the impacts associated with the rehabilitation of distribution line will be minimal and \nthe mitigation measures will be manageable.  \n \n12.  It is predicted also that there will be an environmental impact associated with the \nrehabilitation of the substation particularly related with the disposal of damaged equipment (e.g., \ntransformers, conductors). Unused transformers and equipment that contain Poly Chlorinated \nBiphenyl (PCB) will be collected and cleaned prior to selling them or disposing of them on the \nmarket. The wastewater from cleaning of the equipment will be disposed of after treating them \nas required by the Government. A permit to sell, dispose, and use materials containing PCBs \nwill be processed by the Central Environmental Authority.  \n \n13.  To avoid future environmental problems, it is also recommended that the Project will only \nuse (i) PCB-free transformers and conductors; and (ii) chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-free cooling \nsystem equipment. To avoid noise problems, it is recommended to locate the transformers at a \nreasonable distance so that noise level from the fence will not exceed 55 decibels during the \nday and 45 decibels during the night. It is clear that the proposed mitigation measures are \npractical and manageable and all of these will be included in the loan covenants.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n  1.  Institutional Framework and Responsibility \n \n14.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor.  The  construction  supervisors  from  the  Bangladesh  Power \nDevelopment Board (BPDB) will be responsible in preparing contract documentation so that the \nbidding documents, bills of quantity, and other contractual obligations of the contractor clearly \nidentify environmental responsibilities and describe penalties for noncompliance. BPDB will also \nmonitor the waste oil as part of the effluent disposed outside the project area. BPDB will ensure ", "Appendix 16  71\nthat scrap sold to other parties are oil free and the oil waste will be sold to authorized dealers. \nBPDB is responsible for implementing overall mitigation measures and the monitoring plan, \nwhich includes collaboration with other agencies (e.g., Department of Explosives for testing \nexplosive materials and equipment for CNG storage, District and Municipal Traffic Enforcer for \nrerouting traffic during the construction stage, and Bangladesh Road and Transport Agency for \nmonitoring the movement of buses and auto rickshaws outside Dhaka).  \n \n2.  Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan \n \n15.  The IEE has identified the generic monitoring and management program, which will be \npart of the mitigation on the adverse impacts, which mostly will become responsibility of BPDB. \nTherefore, it is recommended that an environmental and safety unit be established within the \npower plant organization.  \n \n16.   Environmental  monitoring  to  ensure  environmental  mitigation  measures  during  the \nconstruction stage will be carried out by BPDB. While the environmental monitoring to maintain \nenvironmental quality (e.g., effluent emission and other potential pollution such as disposing of \nhazardous and toxic units including oil, as well as noise) during construction and operation will \nbe  carried  out  by  Siddhirganj  Power  Company  in  accordance  with  the  Bangladesh \nEnvironmental  Conservation  Act  1995  and  Bangladesh  Conservation  Rules  1997  to  meet \nexisting government-prescribed environmental quality standards. \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n17.  The IEE study shows that environmental impacts associated with this proposed Project \nare manageable and can be mitigated. While the positive impact particularly in improving air \nquality will lead to reducing the threat on public health. In addition, none of environmentally \nsensitive  areas  will  be  involved  in  this  Project.  Therefore,  a  full  environmental  impact \nassessment to analyze further impacts is not required. However, the Project is categorized as a \n\u201cred category project\u201d in accordance with Bangladesh\u2019s Environmental Preservation Rules 1997. \nTherefore, any construction works for this Project only can be done after the Department of \nEnvironment issues an environmental clearance.  \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n18.  The Project will contribute to improving air quality. The overall IEE finding is that the \nProject will not cause significant environmental problems and that the potential adverse impacts \nare manageable. However, monitoring should be continued.
