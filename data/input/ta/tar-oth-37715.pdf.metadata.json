It  highlighted  the  urgent  need  to  tackle \nenvironmental  degradation  as  a  precondition  for  reducing  poverty.  Poor  people\u2019s  own \nperceptions of their well being are strongly related to environmental quality in terms of access to \nnatural resources and ecosystem services, access to safe water and sanitation, exposure to \npollutants and hazardous wastes, and likelihood of natural disasters.1 At the same time, poor \npeople\u2019s, especially women\u2019s, limited access to finance, markets, and services, combined with \ninadequate  policies  and  institutions,  constrains  their  capacity  to  contribute  positively  to \nenvironmental quality. \n \n2.  The relationship between environmental quality and poverty is most obvious at the local \nlevel, especially in places where institutions and people are least able to cope, and where \nresources  are  scarce.  While  increasing  attention  is  being  placed  on  important  global \nenvironmental issues, the more immediate environmental problems facing the poor are being \nneglected. Poverty is exacerbated by environmental problems, such as locally manifested air \nand water pollution; land degradation and loss of agro-biodiversity, natural habitats, and wild \nfauna; and exposure to natural and manmade hazards. These complex poverty-environment \nlinkages require locally specific responses to increase our understanding and ability to design \nand implement effective interventions.   \n  \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board approved the establishment of the Poverty \nand Environment Fund (PEF), on 7 July 2003. The PEF, a multidonor umbrella facility, with \ninitial contribution from the governments of Norway and Sweden, will support environmental \ninterventions  to  promote  effective  environmental  management  that  reduces  poverty  and/or \nimproves the capacity of poor people to contribute to environmental management.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.   Poverty is a multidimensional concept that cannot be captured by a single dimension \nsuch as income level.  It reflects both geographic location and scale and the economic, social, \nand cultural characteristics of individuals, households, and social groups. The degree of poverty \ndepends on the level of interrelated elements of deprivation, such as inadequate or unstable \nincome and asset base, lack of basic services, discrimination against certain groups of people \nincluding women and indigenous people, and limited or no formal land tenure or user rights \nwithin political or legal systems.  Environmental determinants affect the multidimensional nature \nof poverty.  \n \n5.  In rural areas, the poor often rely on a variety of natural resources for food, fuel, and \nincome. Environmental conditions and access to a variety of natural resources are crucial to the \npoor\u2019s ability to sustain their livelihoods by diversifying and differentiating their use of available \nnatural resources. Loss of livelihoods due to mismanagement of natural resources and resulting \nenvironmental degradation as well as scarcities of arable land and water deprive the poor of an  \nasset base and future livelihood opportunities.   \n \n6.  Environmental degradation also exacerbates the frequency and impact of environmental \ndisasters such as droughts, floods, and other natural hazards in both rural and urban areas.  \n                                                 \n1  Brocklesby, M.A. and E. Einshelwood. 2001. Poverty and the Environment: What the Poor Say. Centre for \nDevelopment Studies. University of Wales: United Kingdom. ", "2  \nWhile  the  poor  have  many  informal  mechanisms  and  survival  strategies,  such  as  income \ndiversification,  temporary  migration,  and  informal  insurance  in  the  face  of  environmental \ndegradation  and  disaster,  their  capacity  to  mitigate  and  recover  from  disaster  is  often \nconstrained by government policies and institutional, as well as socioeconomic factors.  \n \n7.  In urban areas, where a large range of environmental hazards\u2014lack of safe water and \nsanitation, indoor and outdoor air pollution, chemical poisoning, and lack of or inadequate \nphysical  and  safety  measures\u2014are  concentrated,  a  high  proportion  of  the  poor  face  very \nserious  environmental  hazards  in  their  home,  surroundings,  and  workplace.    Due  to  the \nconcentration of people and activities and resulting high levels of pollution and large volume of \nwaste, environmental hazards burdens the poor, especially women and children, with poor \nhealth, injuries, and premature death, which contribute to poverty.    \n \n8.  To reflect the multidimensional and dynamic nature of poverty-environment linkages, \nenvironmental management needs to extend beyond the activities of environmental institutions \nto meet the need to (i) manage and sustain the long-term capacity of the environment and \necosystem that provides goods and services; and (ii) ensure secure and equitable access by \nthe poor to environmental assets and the benefits, to expand their livelihood opportunities, \nprotect their health and capacity to work, and reduce their vulnerability to environment-related \nrisks. This broader approach to environmental management and poverty reduction needs to \ninvolve the public and private sectors and civil society. This broader approach needs to be \ntested and adopted at the local level to demonstrate effective solutions to local environmental \nproblems facing the poor and implemented at the national level to bring about policy and \ninstitutional changes.   \n \n9.  In line with its Poverty Reduction Strategy2 and Environment Policy,3 ADB will assist \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) to pursue projects and programs for environmental and \nnatural resource management to improve poor people\u2019s livelihoods, health, productivity, and \nresilience to natural disasters. This process can be strengthened by structured efforts to identify, \npilot-test, and demonstrate potentially replicable approaches to solving environmental problems \nfacing  the  poor.  Such  identification  and  demonstration  of  promising  approaches,  and  the \nlearning of associated lessons, (i) is expected to accelerate the mainstreaming of environment \nwithin ADB\u2019s operations, within the activities of other funding agencies, and ultimately within \nDMC policies and plans; and (ii) may stimulate mobilization of additional domestic and external \nresources,  especially  in  areas  where  the  perceived  willingness  and  ability  to  pay  for \nenvironmental improvement is currently inadequate. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Purpose and Output \n \n10  The purpose of the proposed regional technical assistance (TA)4 is to promote targeted \nenvironmental interventions that contribute to poverty reduction and improve the environment \nthrough providing funding for pilot interventions, targeted analytical studies, and information \ndissemination  in  the  following  three  prioritized  areas:  (i)  protection,  conservation,  and \nsustainable use of natural resources and ecosystem services to maintain the livelihoods of the \n                                                 \n2  Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development Bank was \napproved by the Board on 9 November 1999. \n3  ADB\u2019s environment policy was approved by the Board 22 August 2002. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 14 October 2003. ", "  3\npoor; (ii) reduction of air and water pollution and waste that directly impacts the health and \nproductivity  of  poor;  and  (iii)  reduction  of  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards  and  disaster \nprevention.  The potential TA activities will be implemented by ADB, and its development \npartners such as all levels of governments, civil society organizations, local communities, and \nbusinesses. Through appropriate linkages with ADB operations, the outcome of the proposed \nTA activities will be sustained by influencing future ADB country programming, policy dialogue, \nproject identification, design, and implementation as well as DMCs\u2019 poverty reduction strategies. \nAppendix 1 provides the TA framework.   \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Eligibility.  Participation in the TA is open to all DMCs.5 Each proposed project, not \nexceeding $250,000,6 should focus on environmental interventions in the three prioritized areas.  \nProposed projects should be in addition to, and not substitute for, ongoing or pipelined activities.  \n \n12.  Selection Principles.  Proposals will be reviewed and recommendations for funding will \nbe made on the basis of the selection criteria (Appendix 2).7      \n \n13.   Component A: Pilot Interventions.  The pilot interventions will support innovative ideas \nthat  demonstrate  unique  institutional  arrangements,  participatory  approaches,  or  technical \nsolutions  to  local  environmental  problems  with  clear  potential  for  successful  replication, \nmainstreaming, and/or upscaling in one or more countries.  The small-scale activities may cover \na range of interventions such as institutional arrangements that recognize gender sensitive  \nnatural  resources  management  and  agriculture;  community-based  resource  management; \nbiodiversity conservation and income-generating opportunities; cleaner production and emission \nmanagement and monitoring among local small and medium enterprises (SMEs), interventions \nin  indoor  air  quality,  public  health,  and  sanitation;  and  environmentally  sound  and  locally \nappropriate  technology  choices  that  increase  outputs  in  agriculture,  forestry,  fisheries,  and \nindustry.  Potential  projects  should  have  strong  measurable  results  that  demonstrate  how \nenvironmental improvement can lead to poverty reduction. Appropriate poverty-environment \nindicators will be developed during the preparation period (January through March 2004) to \nrequire  that  the  proposals  for  pilot  interventions  assess  the  conditions  of  poverty  and \nenvironmental  problems  and  measure  the  progress  through  interventions  toward  expected \nenvironmental, poverty, and economic benefits during the projects\u2019 implementation. \n \n14.  Component B: Targeted Analytical Studies.  This component will include activities \naimed at enhancing the analytical basis for policy dialogue on, raising awareness on, and \nbuilding  capacity  for  poverty-environment  linkages.    This  includes  focused  studies,  action \nresearch,  and  targeted  activities  aimed  at  removing  policies,  institutional,  organizational, \ntechnical,  and  financial  barriers  to  improve  environmental  management  at  the  local  level.  \nProposed studies should have strong linkages to operations. The analysis drawn from the \nstudies  will  answer  some  of  the  key  questions  regarding  the  relationships  between \nenvironmental  change  and  its  impact  on  poor  men\u2019s  and  women\u2019s  livelihood,  health,  and \nvulnerability, and will be an important discussion base for policy dialogue.    \n \n                                                 \n5   A no objection letter has been sent to each DMC to obtain its concurrence with the Poverty and Environment   \nProgram. \n6  Under special cases where the steering committee determines appropriate, proposals greater than $250,000 may  \nbe considered. \n7  Each participating ADB\u2019s resident mission office will prioritize the selection criteria according to its priority areas.  ", "4  \n15.  Component C: Information Dissemination.  The objective of this component is to \nidentify,  compile,  and  disseminate  lessons  learned  and  good  practices  for  addressing  the \nenvironmental dimensions of poverty. The objective can be implemented through awareness \nand capacity-building activities, conferences, and workshops; publications of lessons learned; \nand integration of the knowledge gained into the ADB\u2019s information dissemination and the  \nknowledge  management  activities  of  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department \n(RSDD). As part of RSDD\u2019s information dissemination effort, a communication and information \ndissemination plan will be developed to identify effective dissemination methods and venues, \nincluding internet and intranet-based information management.   \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n  \n16.  The TA will be administered by ADB. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3.92 \nmillion equivalent, of which $3.42 million equivalent will be financed by the PEF, and $500,000 \nequivalent will be financed by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis.    The  cost  estimates  include  consulting  services,  workshops,  publications,  and \nadministrative costs.  The cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 3. \n   \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 4 years, commencing in April 2004 and \nending in March 2008. Proposals will be solicited and reviewed on a periodic basis. RSDD\u2019s \nEnvironment and Social Safeguard Division will administer the TA in close coordination with \nregional departments, and other offices (e.g. the Office of External Relations, Nongovernment \nOrganization  (NGO)  Center,  Office  of  Cofinancing  Operations,  and  other  divisions  within \nRSDD).  \n \n18.  TA activities can be proposed by ADB staff and/or all levels of governments and NGOs \nas well as other local organizations in the participating DMCs, through ADB staff.  Proponents \nneed  to  demonstrate  in  their  proposals  their  consistency  with  national  poverty  reduction \nstrategies and with ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and program (RCSP), country strategy \nand program (CSP), and country environmental analysis.  \n \n19.  A steering committee, comprising representatives of the regional departments, RSDD, \nand other offices, will have overall program oversight responsibilities, including reviewing and \napproving proposals and overseeing the progress in implementing approved projects. Proposals, \nreviewed and prioritized based on the eligibility and selection criteria (Appendix 2), will be \nselected for funding. No project funds will be disbursed without first securing an approval or \u201cno \nobjection\u201d letter for the regional TA from the government concerned.  An NGO focal point at \neach participating resident mission will be responsible for soliciting and screening proposals \nreceived from local governments, NGOs, and other local institutions. Resident missions and \nregional departments are responsible for ensuring the consistency in the proposals, supervising \nthe progress of implementation, and reporting the progress to the PEF secretariat on a periodic \nbasis.   \n \n20.  A small secretariat (PEF secretariat) comprised of Environment and Social Safeguard \nDivision staff and consultants will administer the TA. The PEF secretariat will be responsible for \n(i) preparing proposal guidelines and proposal formats; (ii) setting up a system to monitor the \nimplementation of approved TA activities and disbursements; (iii) developing an information \ndissemination plan; (iv) coordinating the proposal preparation, review, and selection process; (v) \nscreening  proposals  for  eligibility;  (vi)  identifying  NGOs  and  international  organizations  for ", "  5\npotential  partners;  (vii)  developing  and  maintaining  the  TA  web  site;  (viii)  developing  an \nevaluation system; (ix) producing summaries of key innovation characteristics for dissemination; \n(x) conducting annual review missions; and (xi) preparing semiannual progress reports, annual \nstatus reports, and a final report on lessons-learned. As part of the internal coordination, the \nsecretariat will collaborate with concerned departments on a periodic basis to eliminate any \nduplication and/or conflict with other similar funds operations or research activities promoted by \nADB.8  The PEF secretariat will work with the NGO Center and Office of External Relations to \ndevelop and implement an information dissemination plan to identify effective dissemination \nvenues and methods, and collaborate with the similar initiatives9 to enhance synergy, cohost \nworkshops, and explore future collaboration for the TA implementation.   \n \n21.  ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants, to implement the TA and assist the PEF secretariat.  The outline terms of reference \nfor consulting services are in Appendix 4. A domestic consultant will be recruited as program \nadministering specialist for 40 person-months to assist the PEF secretariat in administering the \nTA activities. An international consultant will be recruited as analyst for 3 person-months to \nassist  the  PEF  secretariat  in  developing  performance  indicators  and  assessing  and \nsummarizing  key  characteristics  of  innovation  and  best  practices  implemented  by  other \norganizations.  Consultants will be engaged to implement approved TA activities.  Their tasks \nwill include evaluating and preparing the completion report for the individual approved TA \nactivities. Small civil works, equipment, and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement or other procedures acceptable to ADB.   \n \n22.  Progress reports on the TA and use of the PEF will be prepared by the PEF secretariat \non a 6-month basis in collaboration with the Office of Cofinancing Operations. TA activities will \nbe monitored and reports made available through the TA web site. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n \n23.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $3,420,000  for  the  Poverty  and \nEnvironment Program, to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty and Environment Fund. If \nthe Board approves ADB administering the technical assistance, the President, acting under the \nauthority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB providing the balance of the technical \nassistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $500,000,  for  the  Poverty  and  Environment \nProgram, and hereby reports this action to the Board.    \n \n                                                 \n8   The close coordination required includes Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, \nGovernance Cooperation Fund, Cooperation Fund for the  Water Sector, and Agriculture, Natural Resource, Rural \nDevelopment Committee managed by RSDD, other similar funds and research initiatives supported by ADB \nthrough regional departments and Office of Cofinancing  Operations.    \n9   Similar initiatives include Poverty and Environment Initiative by the United Nations Development Programme and \nPoverty Environment Partnership implemented by many funding agencies including ADB.
