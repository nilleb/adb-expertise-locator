INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will assist the Human \nSettlements Development Program of the Government of Mongolia to define strategic directions \nfor inclusive, green, competitive, and sustainable urban development through the formulation of \nprovincial  socioeconomic  and  spatial  development  plans,  and  with  prioritized  legislative, \ntechnological, and institutional strengthening support. The TA is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2018\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The TA is aligned \nwith ADB Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priorities, especially reducing inequality, tackling climate \nchange, making cities more livable, and promoting rural development.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia's transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy in 1991 led \nto important changes in its socioeconomic structure. These changes were reflected in the massive \nand continuous migration to urban areas\u2014by 2017, Mongolia's urbanization rate had reached \n71% (2.2 million of a total population of 3.1 million).3  The country-wide migration also led to a \nrapid expansion of substandard ger (traditional tent) areas4 that lack basic urban infrastructure \nand services such as paved roads, water supply and sewerage networks, district heating systems, \nand public space and services. As a result, these ger areas are having serious environmental \nimpacts on urban centers through high levels of air, water, and soil pollution. Mongolia's urban \ncenters also face high levels of natural disaster risk.5 Some striking features of the current \nMongolian urban system are the demographic and economic dominance of Ulaanbaatar, the \ncapital city, and its significant difference in size compared with the aimag (province) centers. In \n2017, Ulaanbaatar was home to more than 1.46 million people, accounting for 47% of the \npopulation,  about  two-thirds  of  Mongolia's  gross  domestic  product,  and  66%  of  the  urban \npopulation. Except for the cities of Darkhan and Erdenet (each with about 80,000 people in 2016), \nthe  services  in  urban  areas  across  the  country  are  weak,  unsound,  and  truncated.6 This \nunderserves the needs of urban residents; fails to reduce migration to Ulaanbaatar; slows down \neconomic  diversification;  and  is  an  obstacle  for  enhancing  inclusive,  green,  resilient,  and \nsustainable economic and social development. \n \n3.  The government faces the complex task to strategically plan its urban development, the \nspatial distribution of the country's population, and its economic activities to optimize the benefits \nof urbanization and economies of agglomeration. The most recent national urban development \nplan was formulated in 1996 as part of the national framework for regional development in \nMongolia.7 However,  only  some  portions  of  the  plan  were  formalized  and  comprehensive \nsolutions aimed to drive the country's future urban development were never implemented. The \nsignificant changes in its socioeconomic structure, and the partial approval and implementation \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2018\u20132020. Manila. The TA title has been adjusted to \nbetter reflect its objective. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on \n21 September 2018. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n3  United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 2017. World Urbanization \nProspects: The 2017 Revision\u2014Key Findings and Advance Tables. New York. \n4  About 60% of the total population in the case of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city. \n5  Such as floods, severe winters, droughts, dzud (succession of severe winters and droughts), storms, or earthquakes. \n6  Most of the rest of the aimag capitals have a population below 25,000. \n7  The national framework for regional development in Mongolia is laid out in the Regional Development Concept \n(adopted by Parliament in June 2001), the Law on Regionalized Development Management and Coordination \n(adopted by Parliament in May 2003), and the Medium-Term Strategy on Regional Development, 2001\u20132010 \n(adopted by Parliament in June 2003). \n ", "2 \nof the national framework for regional development made the existing urban development plans \nobsolete. Mongolia is in urgent need to formulate a comprehensive and pragmatic approach to \ntackling the current socioeconomic and spatial development challenges, such as unbalanced \nterritorial development and lack of attractiveness for investments. Such a new approach should \naim to provide livable urban environments, boost local economic potential, reduce urban pollution, \nprovide adequate housing to residents, decrease migration to Ulaanbaatar, strengthen the link \nbetween urban and rural economies, and mitigate climate change impact. \n \n4.  In response to the need for an updated urban development master plan, the government \nformulated a program that aims to define short-, medium-, and long-term strategic directions for \ninclusive, green, competitive, and sustainable urban development in Mongolia. The program will \ninclude both national and provincial integrated socioeconomic and spatial development plans as \nwell as legislative, institutional, and technological reforms. A national committee headed by the \nPrime Minister (chair) and the minister of construction and urban development (vice-chair) will be \nformed to guide the implementation of the program. The national committee will be assisted by a \nstanding  office  to  coordinate  activities  across  different  ministries  and  agencies.  An  urban \ndevelopment and research institute will also be established under the Ministry of Construction \nand Urban Development (MCUD) to coordinate the work plans of working groups and inputs from \nvarious stakeholders such as academic and research centers and nongovernment organizations.8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: policy environment for urban and land \ndevelopment improved (Objective 5, Article 2.1.5, Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision \n2030)9 in support of economic diversification and social stability.10 The TA will have the following \noutcome:  inclusive  and  comprehensive  strategic  directions  for  sustainable  human  spatial \ndistribution in Mongolia developed.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Provincial development plans formulated. The TA will build on existing \nstudies  and formulate a  development-oriented  aimag  plan for  each of the  21  aimags  and \nUlaanbaatar City. Each plan should be an integrated collaborative planning approach that builds \nup from the local level into a provincial urban development framework, relying on priority actions \nand incentives to achieve the recommended vision, objectives, and strategic directions. It will \nidentify desirable development, socioeconomic and environmental objectives, and pragmatic \nsolutions to achieve them. It will help MCUD and local governments in decision-making to drive \nthe  socioeconomic  and  environmentally  sustainable  development  of  each  aimag;  and  will \ncollectively reflect and support the need and aspiration of the people and business community. It \nwill cover three main aspects: a planning framework used by aimags in preparing their general \n                                                \n8  Several related studies were carried out by the government and various donors to serve as the foundation for the \nHuman  Settlements  Development  Program,  especially  the  Mongolia  National  Urban  Assessment,  2017 \n(unpublished) by ADB; and Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2017.

Manila. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nterritorial and spatial plans; a policy framework that includes policies, regulations, and institutional \nsettings; and development drivers or smart growth features. This will be complemented by a \nhuman settlement typology, describing the role, function, and potential investment for each type \nof human settlement. The analysis will take into account the role of each aimag within a broader \nregional urban cluster, the low population density of Mongolia, the solutions for redeveloping ger \nareas and achieving affordable housing supply, environmental sustainability, as well as the \nimportance of urban\u2013rural links. The data collected for this output will also be incorporated into \nthe web-based mapping platform and the e-atlases to be developed under output 4 of the TA. \n \n7.  Output  2:  Integrated  national  strategy  and  policies  for  human  settlement  and \nterritorial development co-developed. In collaboration with the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), the TA will contribute to the outputs led by JICA in the preparation of the national \ncomprehensive development plan of Mongolia. These include the formulation of (i) national \nstrategy and policies, and (ii) national and regional socioeconomic and spatial development plans. \n \n8.  Output 3: Relevant national laws and regulations developed. The TA will (i) support \nthe amendment of  the existing urban development law and review other pertinent laws and \nregulations, i.e., land law, urban construction law, and urban redevelopment law or regionalized \ndevelopment management and coordination law, to ensure that they are aligned with and can \nsupport the implementation of the national urban strategy; and (ii) help develop guidelines for the \nimplementation of the urban development law as well as its effective enforcement. \n \n9.  Output 4: Web-based mapping platform and provincial e-atlases completed. The TA \nwill strengthen the existing web-based mapping application developed under the National Urban \nAssessment of Mongolia, 2015\u20132016 (footnote 7) by providing equipment and training to MCUD \nfor developing a mapping system for targeted areas. The mapping system will translate the \nfindings of the regional development plans and use satellite maps and statistical mapping as an \nopen source to support an evidence-based decision-making process. An e-atlas for each province \nand sub-region of Mongolia will also be produced in both paper-based and electronic versions.12  \n \n10.  Output  5:  Program  coordination  capacity  for  urban  planning  and  urban \ndevelopment strengthened. The TA will provide capacity-building support to the Standing Office \nof  the  National  Committee  and  the  Urban  Development  Design  and  Planning  Institute  to \ncoordinate the program, including but not limited to training programs and workshops, and \nexchange and dissemination of knowledge products and tools. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,150,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of support staff, meeting facilities, data, topical information \nand government documentation, and other in-kind contributions. Ineligible expenditures include \nthe following: pilot activities with no link to ADB-financed operations; activities normally funded \nunder ADB loans or ADB budgets for preparation of ADB-financed projects, including TA for these \nactivities; preparation of poverty reduction strategy papers and other TA for poverty reduction \nmonitoring activities; academic research, land acquisition, motor vehicles purchase, government \nstaff salaries, scholarships or long internships, and foreign training or study tours. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n12 For this output, the usage of Spatial Data Analysis Explorer (SPADE), developed jointly by ADB, the European Space \nAgency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the University of Tokyo, will be considered. \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA. The Urban and Social Sectors Division of the East Asia \nDepartment will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. Engagement of the consultants and \nprocurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nthe associated project administration instructions and staff instructions. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2018\u2013December 2020 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Construction and Urban Development \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nQuality- and cost-based  International  $823,000 \nselection method  (39.5 person-months) \nNational (135.5 person- $553,000 \nmonths) \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants \nShopping  2 contracts  $110,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Equipment will be turned over to the executing agency upon completion of \narrangement upon TA completion  TA activities. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB. \n \n13.  Consulting services. The TA will require tentatively 175 person-months of consulting \ninputs from 10 international experts (39.5 person-months) and 12 national experts (135.5 person-\nmonths).13 A consulting firm will be selected and engaged by ADB under a performance-based \ncontract using the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a 90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio and \nfull technical proposal procedure.14 Contingencies may be allocated to recruit additional experts \nby the consulting firm or to hire individual consultants based on needs during TA implementation.\n \n14.  Cofinancier requirements. A TA letter-signing ceremony with press coverage will be \norganized. To enhance visibility, a representative from the Embassy of Japan in Mongolia will be \ninvited. The TA will ensure clear references to the financial contribution of the Government of \nJapan during major project activities and for major outputs (i.e., workshops, publications, press \nreleases, and speeches); and use the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and Japan aid logos on \ncorrespondence, workshop material, banners, and any media publication. The Embassy of Japan \nin Mongolia will be informed about the TA progress, milestones, and deliverables, especially when \nmajor  changes  in  scope  and  objectives  are  required.  Given  the  proposed  program\u2019s \ninterdependence with JICA\u2019s involvement in urban and regional development, close strategic and \npolicy cooperation is expected during implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  administering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$2,000,000 to the Government of Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction for the Human Settlements Development Program, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \n13 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 The ratio of 90:10 will be adopted because of the complexity of the project design. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nPolicy environment for urban and land development improved (Objective 5, Article 2.1.5, Mongolia \nSustainable Development Vision 2030)a in support of economic diversification and social stability (country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020)b \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Indicators with  and Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2021     \nInclusive and  The program is approved by the  MCUD and  Mongolian Parliament \ncomprehensive  Government of Mongolia  socioeconomic  is unwilling to accept  \nstrategic directions  (2018 baseline: not applicable)  framework  the socioeconomic \nfor sustainable  framework \n   \nhuman spatial \ndistribution in \nMongolia developed \nOutputs  By 2020     \n1.
