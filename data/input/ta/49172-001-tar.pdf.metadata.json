INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Outlook  (ADO)  is  a  flagship  publication  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), showcasing its knowledge and expertise about the region. This \npublication  includes  staff  analyses  of  the  macroeconomic  prospects  for  all  of  ADB\u2019s  45 \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs), referred to collectively as developing Asia, and provides \ninsights into the current economic issues the region faces. Its content provides vital intelligence \nto policy makers in DMCs, ADB Management and shareholders, and researchers globally, and \nunderpins ADB operational decisions. The production of the ADO has been supported regularly \nby technical assistance (TA) funding.1 The objectives, scope, and activities to be covered by the \ncluster TA are in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As identified in ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, poverty reduction and inclusive \ngrowth are among the strategic priorities that will guide ADB\u2019s work through 2020.3 The ability to \nunderstand the key drivers of, and constraints on, economic growth is a critical element of \ninclusive growth. With its comprehensive analysis of evolving macroeconomic developments, \nthe ADO plays an important role in fostering this understanding, a role recognized by the TA \nStrategic Forum in 2008. Under ADB\u2019s streamlined business processes, the ADO is one of the \nmain  references  for  the  economic  assessment  and  outlook  section  of  country  partnership \nstrategies. \n \n3.  In line with the 2015 staff guidelines to improve mainstreaming of inclusive growth into \ncountry partnership strategies,4 the ADO country chapters support the analysis of key obstacles \nto  inclusive  economic  growth:  (i)  factors  preventing  productive  employment  generation,  (ii) \nhuman development constraints, (iii) gender and other socioeconomic barriers, (iv) spatial and \ngeographical limitations, (v) institutional and policy weaknesses, and (vi) factors preventing \nexpansion of social protection programs. The theme chapters tackle important development \nchallenges for a transforming Asia and the Pacific. Recent themes have included confronting \nrising inequality in Asia; improving weak governance and institutional capacity; safeguarding \nfinancial stability; and addressing persistent gender disparities. The ADO can also contribute to \ninformed debate in other topical areas, such as avoiding the middle-income trap; and coping \nwith environmental pressures. \n \n4.  Developing Asia has enjoyed stellar growth since its recovery from the 1997\u20131998 Asian \nfinancial crisis. A generally favorable global environment coupled with structural transformation \nand reforms boosted productivity. The 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis, however, altered the \nglobal economic and financial backdrop. Although developing Asia\u2019s growth is still more resilient \ncompared  to  the  advanced  economies,  growth  prospects  for  some  of  the  region\u2019s  largest \neconomies are looking less promising. This change ushers in a \u201cnew normal\u201d of global and \ndomestic conditions that may have implications to the region\u2019s growth potential. \n \n5.  The  region's  rapid  growth  has  also  increased  its  share  of  global  greenhouse  gas \nemissions  making  the  current  path  unsustainable. Without  radical  changes  to  the  region\u2019s \nenergy mix, highly polluting coal consumption would rise by a whopping 81% as consumption of \n                                                \n1  The ADO has been identified as a corporate priority TA and was submitted to the Strategy and Policy Department \nas part of ERCD\u2019s priority TA program in October 2014. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 July 2015. \n3  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2015. Revised Guidelines on Inclusive Economic Growth in Country Partnership Strategy. Manila. \n ", "2   \noil would double and the consumption of natural gas would triple by the year 2035.5 This would \ndouble carbon dioxide emissions to over 20 billion tons in the next two decades. Developing \nAsia alone would then emit almost all of the 22 billion tons that climate change experts see as \nthat  year\u2019s  maximum  sustainable  carbon  dioxide  emissions  for  the  whole  world.  Locally, \nexpanded fossil fuel use would foul air and water. This phenomenon has raised environmental \nissues that the region needs to address in order to achieve sustainable development.  \n \n6.  With these foregoing issues in view, the Macroeconomics and Research Division (ERMR) \nwill continue to formulate a 2-year rolling research plan centered on enhancing the quality of \nADB\u2019s flagship publications. This is an initiative that ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department (ERCD), previously the Economic and Research Department, started \nin  2011  in  response  to  the  growing  demand  for  knowledge  solutions  from  ADB  DMCs, \nknowledge-related support from within ADB, and an Asian voice in international forums.6 The \nextension of the research production process proved to be beneficial for the ADO, especially in \nthe preparation of the theme chapters, as it allowed ERMR more time for in-depth analysis and \nrigorous  peer  review.  As  the  ADO  will  cover  several  topics  encompassing  important \ndevelopment challenges that the transforming Asia and Pacific region is facing, the TA cluster \napproach is more appropriate to ensure that the 2-year rolling research work is continuously \nsupported through timely engagement of experts and other activities. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced debate and policy research on the development \nchallenges faced by Asia and the Pacific and an improved environment for policy formulation in \nDMCs.  The outcome will be increased reference to the ADO by the media and by economic \nresearchers, both within ADB and beyond. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Cluster Technical Assistance \n \n8.  The proposed TA cluster will comprise three TA subprojects encompassing production of \nthe  2016\u20132018  ADOs,  ADO  updates,  and  ADO  supplements.  These  TA  subprojects  are \nchronologically sequenced. The outputs of the cluster TA will be disseminated ADO, ADO \nupdates, and supplements from 2016 to 2018, and published background papers, as well as \ninitial activities on ADO 2019. The cluster TA will support the following activities: (i) preparing \nbackground analytical papers following the 2-year rolling research plan, (ii) further developing \nand refining analytical methods, (iii) drafting of ADO content, (iv) editing economic content and \nmanuscripts, (v) preparing and laying out of materials for publication, and (vi) disseminating key \nresults and policy messages. In parallel, the cluster TA will support initiatives to build capacity \nfor macroeconomic modelling and for generating growth projections and monitoring markets. To \nprovide a solid empirical and analytical foundation for the content of ADO, the TA cluster will \ncommission background research papers that will supplement ERMR research on the selected \ntheme topics by analyzing issues and policy implications for developing Asia. These papers will \nbe  consolidated  in  edited  research  volumes  to  provide  researchers  with  more  extensive \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n ", "  3 \nanalyses  related  to  the  theme  topics.  The  research  volumes  may  be  copublished  with  a \nreputable publishing house, which would likely entail a buyback arrangement. \n \n9.  The TA cluster will also support the development and refinement of analytical methods \nto supplement ADB\u2019s short- and medium-term country economic monitoring and reporting. This \nwill strengthen the economic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs, \nthereby making economic policies better informed and designed, and enhancing ADB\u2019s country \nassistance. As part of the preparation to strengthen the ADO content, the TA team will organize \nconferences and workshops. The writers\u2019 workshop, which will be co-organized with the Human \nResource Policy and Programs Division, will focus on macroeconomic analysis of current issues, \ngrowth accounting, economic projections and macroeconomic modeling, and effective writing \nskills.  The  workshop  will  target  selected  economists  and  national  staff  in  ADB\u2019s  regional \ndepartments and resident missions that are responsible for writing the country chapters. The \nconferences will focus on the reports\u2019 theme chapters. Distinguished economists in the region \nwill be invited to discuss initial drafts of the background papers to improve the analytical rigor \nand policy relevance of the theme chapters. \n \n10.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the ADO and the \nedited volume of background research papers, international consultants will provide high-quality \nediting services. \n \n11.  The publications will be widely disseminated in collaboration with ADB\u2019s Department of \nExternal Relations (DER) and participating resident missions. The international launch will be \nfollowed by presentations cohosted by ADB development partners within and outside Asia and \nthe  Pacific.  Outreach  will  include  analytical  discussions  of  the  issues  in  partnership  with \nacademic institutions and think tanks. The cluster TA will also undertake activities to evaluate \nthe effectiveness of ADO outreach. ERMR will work with DER to attempt to capture broader and \nmore useful client feedback. \n \n2.  Subproject 1 (2015\u20132017) \n \n12.  The first subproject of the cluster TA will cover the ADO 2016 cycle and will produce the \nADO 2016, ADO 2016 Update, ADO  supplements, and background papers as outputs. In \naddition to the country-by-country and regional economic analyses, ADO 2016 will feature a \nsection  on  developing  Asia's  potential  growth  and  structural  transformation.  Asia's  newly \nindustrialized  economies  successfully  made  the  transition  from  low-income  to  high-income \neconomies. However, the path that these economies took to transform themselves may not be \nfeasible in the current global economic landscape. The theme chapter will use the estimates of \npotential growth drivers\u2014determined by structural transformation considerations\u2014to map out \nscenarios for the future path of the region's income. Building on the work by the Economic \nAnalysis and Operational Support Division on low-carbon growth, the ADO 2016 Update theme \ntopic will tackle the green growth challenge for Asia. Using a top-down global computable \ngeneral  equilibrium  model  and  the  global  energy  selection  optimization  model,  the  theme \nchapter will look at both the cost of no action and cost of moving towards a low carbon growth \npath in developing Asia. It will also delve into the constraints and bottlenecks that impede its \nshift to green growth and propose policy actions to overcome them.  ERCD will explore the \npossibility of collaborating with a partner center of excellence, for instance, the Global Green \nGrowth Institute. Initial activities for the preparation of the ADO 2017 may also be supported \nunder the subproject. \n \n \n ", "4   \n3.  Subprojects 2 (2016\u20132018) and 3 (2017\u20132019) \n \n13.  Subsequent TA subprojects will be structured along the lines of TA subproject 1 and will \ncover the production of ADO 2017, ADO 2017 Update, ADO 2018, ADO 2018 Update, four ADO \nsupplements,  and  relevant  background  papers.  The  flagship  publications  will  provide \ncomprehensive  analyses  of  economic  performance  in  the  previous  year  and  will  offer \nprojections for the next 2 years for the 45 economies in developing Asia. For the theme topics of \nADO  2017  and  beyond,  ERCD  will  solicit  ideas  through  discussions  with  ADB\u2019s  regional \ndepartments, members of the regional economic outlook task force, and exchanges with sector \nand thematic groups, as well as by responding to priority issues identified by ADB Management. \nTo  ensure  that  the  theme  chapters  support  ADB\u2019s  understanding  of  the  region\u2019s  evolving \ndevelopment challenges on the selected issue, a consultative process will be followed to refine \nthe focus of the theme topics. As with past ADO research, ERCD will explore partnerships with \nrelevant centers of excellence. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,600,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V for subproject 1, while subsequent TA \nsubprojects will be financed by the succeeding TASF replenishment). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency, while its Macroeconomics Research Division (ERMR) \nof ERCD will be the implementing division. Adopting the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach in knowledge \nsolutions, ERMR will continue to collaborate with regional departments and resident missions in \npreparing the country chapters. To ensure that ADO knowledge work is operationally relevant, \nERMR  will  work closely with regional departments and  sector and thematic groups in the \nidentification and preparation of ADO theme chapters. ERMR will also seek to collaborate with a \nreputable center of excellence during TA implementation. The cluster TA will be implemented \nfrom September 2015 to December 2019. \n \n16.  Each TA subproject will be approved by the chief economist and director general, ERCD. \nApproval will be sought through a memorandum outlining the (i) overall progress of the TA \ncluster to date, (ii) outcome and intended outputs of the TA subproject, (iii) cost estimates and \nbudget, (iv) implementation arrangements, (v) implementation schedule, (vi) terms of reference \nfor consultants, and (vii) other aspects, as appropriate. Each TA subproject proposal requires a \ndraft design and monitoring framework and will be subject to consultations with departments \nand/or offices concerned before submission to the chief economist and director general, ERCD \nfor approval. \n \n17.  The production of a high-quality ADO will be a joint effort of ERCD economists, country \neconomists of the regional departments, other experts within ADB, and consultants. The ADO \nwill require international consultancy from economists who will prepare the background papers \nand analyses on issues pertaining to the theme topic. International economic advisory and \nediting consultants will be required for the economic and technical editing of ADO manuscripts \nbefore final publication. An international expert on communication strategy will also be engaged \nto  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  ADO  dissemination.  National  economics  consultants  and \nresearch assistants will be required to assist with data management and to conduct research on \nissues related to macroeconomic development, growth, trade and investment, human capital \ndevelopment, and long-term employment generation in the Asia and Pacific region. National \n ", "  5 \nconsultants  will  be  needed  to  perform  the  desktop  publishing  and  graphic  design  of  the \npublication. Resource persons will be engaged for a maximum of 10 working days to conduct \ntraining on macroeconomics and economic forecasting and also serve as discussants during \nworkshops. The consultants and resource persons will be recruited as individuals as the TA will \nrequire rapid mobilization of the editorial consultants and will involve independent studies where \nthe consultant\u2019s experience and qualifications are the primary consideration. This will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). Workshops will be conducted to review and discuss the initial country chapters and \nbackground papers prepared for the ADO. The TA may cover travel expenses of selected \nresident mission staff participating in the workshops as resource persons. \n \n18.  The  TA  cluster  will  finance  procurement  of  information  technology  equipment  and \nsoftware, and information and knowledge services such as subscription to macroeconomic data \nproviders as may be required to inform relevant up-to-date content. All procurement to be \nfinanced under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). Procurement of information technology equipment and \nsoftware will be done in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology \nand Office of Administrative Services. After the TA, any procured equipment will be disposed of \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Administration Instructions.7 Disbursements under the TA will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n19.  As team leader, the director, ERMR will monitor the work under the TA to ensure its \neffective implementation. ERCD researchers will review the work of consultants engaged to \nverify that tasks are completed in accordance with the terms of reference, and that draft reports \nare  delivered  on  time,  with  the  director,  ERMR  managing  the  combined  outputs  of  the \nconsultants. Dissemination activities will be conducted in cooperation with ADB\u2019s DER and \nresident missions. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $3,600,000 on a grant basis for Asian Development Outlook \n2016\u20132018.  \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2013.
