I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Infrastructure Development Investment \nProgram for Tourism. \n \n2.  The investment program targets inclusive economic growth and provision of livelihood \nopportunities  for  local  communities  in  the  tourism  sector  through  tourism  infrastructure \ndevelopment. It will focus on preservation and development of natural and cultural heritage, and \nincidental  services  linked  to  subprojects  including  municipal  services, 1  tourist  support \ninfrastructure and services, and tourist destination connectivity infrastructure. The proposed \nMFF is provided to support the four participating states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil \nNadu, and Uttarakhand to develop the tourism sector as a key driver for economic growth. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  India has experienced impressive economic growth recently. Gross domestic product \n(GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 7.7% during FY2002\u2013FY2007 and is forecast to \nincrease to 8.7% during the 11th Five-Year Plan (2007\u20132012), making it one of the fast-growing \neconomies in the world.  \n \n4.  India\u2019s economic growth aims at being inclusive. The percentage of the population below \nthe poverty line has declined from 36% in FY1994 to 27.5% in FY2005, but the rate of decline in \npoverty has not kept pace with GDP growth. The rural\u2013urban divide is rapidly rising in India, with \nper capita household expenditure in rural areas estimated at less than half of that in urban \nareas.2 Economic growth across regions has also not been uniform.  \n \n5.  However, it is neither easy nor effective to try to reduce the rural\u2013urban disparities by \nstimulating  the  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector  alone.  To  address  the  disparities  more \neffectively, it is important to stimulate the rural non-agriculture sector and the rural service \nsector as a whole to generate more economic and employment opportunities. \n \n6.  Potentially, India is one of the attractive tourist destinations in the world and its tourism \nsector has been growing rapidly. Total foreign tourist arrivals have increased by about 126% \nfrom 2.38 million in 2002 to around 5.37 million in 2008 (or 14.6% growth per annum). In 2008, \nabout $11.75 billion was generated in foreign exchange. Total domestic tourist visits have also \ngrown by about 109% from 269.6 million in 2002 to 562.9 million in 2008 (or 13.1% growth per \nannum).3 Virtually every kind of tourism\u2014cultural, religious, eco and adventure, medical, and \nrelaxation\u2014has  significant  prospects  in  the  country.  The  richly  varied  developed  and \nundeveloped tourist attractions permit product differentiation and branding. Rapid expansion \nand upgrading of the sector\u2019s infrastructure and services to international standards will increase \nits  attractiveness,  efficiency,  and  competitiveness  against  other  international  destinations,4 \nthereby creating significant opportunities for employment generation and growth in livelihood \nprograms. \n                                                 \n1  Municipal services includes water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, drainage and flood control. \n2  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n3  Government of India, Ministry of Tourism. 2009. India Tourism Statistics 2008. Delhi.  \n4  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Improving Connectivity and Destination Management of Cultural and Natural \nResources in the South Asia Subregion. Manila (TA 6504-REG, approved on 8 December 2008). This technical \nassistance (TA) looks into this aspect. ", "2 \n \n7.  In 2002, the government adopted a new policy that recognized tourism as one of the \nsectors with high potential for growth and employment generation, particularly in less-developed \nareas. Based on 2003\u20132004 surveys, India\u2019s tourism sector contributed only 5.9% of GDP, \nsustaining around 41.8 million people in full-time jobs. However, such a level of contribution to \nGDP by the tourism sector is much lower than the world average of 10.4% in 2007.5 Increased \ninvestments  in  tourism  can,  therefore,  generate  significantly  more  direct  and  indirect \nemployment because of tourism sector\u2019s forward and backward linkages, and contribute to \nmitigating the high levels of rural unemployment and poverty, and the rural\u2013urban inequalities. \nThis strategy is reflected in the government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan and the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  India  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u20132012  (footnote  2)  that  supports \ndevelopment of required urban infrastructure to strengthen the tourism potential of heritage \ncities in an environmentally sustainable manner. \n \n8.  To  this  end,  the  government  committed  to  (i) assisting  the  state  governments  with \ntourism development; (ii) encouraging private sector provision of tourist facilities and services, \nsupported by public sector infrastructure development; and (iii) providing regulatory support to \nensure sustainable tourism. A tourism sector road map for the country, prepared with ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA) support in the context of the government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan, sets \ntargets  to  increase  visitor  volumes,  and  their  average  length  of  stay  and  spending,  and \nemphasizes more equitable sharing of tourism benefits with local communities. Under the TA, a \nset of recommendations, which are part of the road map, was also made for capacity building \nand human resource development.6 While the tourism sector\u2019s growth during the 10th Five-Year \nPlan (2002\u20132007) period was impressive as is mentioned above, 11th Five-Year Plan targets \nwere rather ambitious, which included 10 million total international tourist arrivals and 812 \nmillion total domestic tourist visits by 2011, and are turning out to be challenging due to, inter \nalia, the global economic slowdown that started in 2008, badly affecting tourism throughout the \nworld. \n \n9.  Private sector participation in the tourism sector is a relatively recent phenomenon in \nIndia. Many states are still in the transition from service providers to promoters and regulators of \ntourism development with increasingly more private sector service providers actively joining the \nindustry.  However,  the  public  sector  still  has  a  significant  role  to  play  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment  if  the  economic  potential  of  tourism  is  to  be  realized.  Inadequate  or  poor \ninfrastructure connecting the gateways from outside the states and connecting tourist attractions \nwithin each state, as well as the lack of basic services at tourist destinations\u2014such as water \nsupply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management\u2014need  to  be  addressed.  Infrastructure  to \nsupport community-based tourism is almost absent. \n \n10.  The investment program will assist the government in achieving its targets by tapping \nthe tourism sector\u2019s potential to contribute to sustainable and inclusive economic growth. It will \nrespond to the urgent need for developing tourism-related infrastructure in the four participating \nstates\u2014Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and Uttarakhand (the three main states of the North West \nHimalayan Heritage Circuit), and Tamil Nadu (the anchor state of the South Heritage Circuit)\u2014\nto  promote  the  economic  potential  of  the  tourism  sector  within  a  planned  framework  and \naddress  weaknesses  in  management  capacity.  These  four  states  voluntarily  sought  to \nparticipate  in  the  implementation  of  the  road  map,  and  the  government  supported  their \n                                                 \n5  World Travel and Tourism Council http://www.wttc.org/eng/Home/ \n6  ADB. 2007. Component Technical Assistance for Tourism Infrastructure Development Study. Under: ADB. 2006. \nTechnical Assistance Cluster to India for Project Processing and Capacity Development. Manila (TA 4814-IND). \nThe component TA was approved on 18 December 2006 by the director general of the South Asia Department. ", "3 \nparticipation. The government prepared a more specific road map along with a framework for \nnecessary  policy  and  sector  reforms  for  each  of  the  four  states  under  follow-up  ADB \nassistance,7 and proposed the MFF modality to support the government\u2019s medium- and long-\nterm goals. \n \n11.  While infrastructure supporting tourism is being put in place, sector reform must be \ncarried out in parallel to attain the goals of more sustainable and inclusive tourism sector \ndevelopment. Key challenges include existing limitations in (i) public sector financing; (ii) sector \npolicies on, and institutional capacities for, heritage site management; (iii) an effective enabling \nenvironment  for  enhanced  private  sector  participation;  (iv)  operation  and  maintenance  of \ntourism infrastructure; and (v) effective mechanisms to engage local communities in the tourism \nvalue chain. Detailed discussions about the national tourism development road map and tourism \nroad maps of the four participating states can be found in the framework financing agreement \n(FFA).8 \n \n12.  The  investment  program  includes  a  number  of  policy-driven  sector  reforms.  The \nparticipating states are committed to making investments in the tourism sector more attractive \nfor  private  sector  participation.  They  will  also  promote  homestay  programs  and  other \nnoncommercial or semicommercial lodging alternatives, such as bed and breakfast facilities. \nEach state will develop a tourism policy to mainstream (i) balanced distribution of economic \nopportunities  across  the  state  through  the  promotion  of  community-based,  tourism-related \neconomic and livelihood activities, and ecotourism development; (ii) financial sustainability of \ntourism destinations and their heritage assets, and connectivity infrastructure; and (iii) policy \nand regulatory reforms to provide for adaptive reuse of publicly owned heritage buildings so that \nadditional means of cost recovery are established. \n \n13.   The  MFF  modality  is  considered  suitable  for  the  proposed  intervention  because \ndeveloping  the  capacities  of  the  sector  agencies  as  facilitators  and  regulators  of  tourism \ndevelopment will be a gradual process requiring longer-term commitments. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  investment  program  will  enhance  the  contribution  of  the  tourism  sector  to \nsustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth  during  its  10-year  implementation  period.  The \nimpact can be assessed by a 50% increase in local employment  created by tourism and \neconomic activities linked to tourism in each participating state, and a 30% increase in the \naggregate contribution of tourism to the GDP of each participating state. The outcome will be \nincreased volume of domestic and international tourists. More private sector investments in \ntourism and enhancement of destinations and attractions are also expected.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The investment program outputs will be (i) improved basic urban infrastructure (such as \nwater supply, sanitation, road and public transport, solid waste management, and environmental \nimprovement) and incidental services (such as public toilets, street signage and lighting) at \nexisting and emerging tourist destinations and gateways; (ii) improved connectivity to tourist \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2007.

To complete phase 2, which \nfocuses on implementation capacity development support to the participating states, the completion date was \nextended to 31 August 2011. \n8  Framework Financing Agreement (Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nattractions focusing on the improvement of last-mile connectivity; (iii) enhanced quality of natural \nand  cultural  tourist  attractions  to  ensure  convenience  and  safety  for  visitors;  (iv) greater \nparticipation by local communities in tourism-related economic and livelihood activities; and \n(v) strengthened capacity of concerned sector agencies and local communities for planning, \ndevelopment, management, and marketing of tourist destinations and attractions, and promoting \nprivate sector participation and small businesses. \n \n16.  Supporting programs will be established for developing the capacities to promote private \nsector participation and small businesses to increase the benefits they gain from tourism, and \nstimulating  more  active  tourism-related  economic  and  livelihood  activities.  Consultancy  will \nsupport project implementation and programs for developing the capacities of sector agencies \nfor sustainable management of tourism and related infrastructure and services. Two batches of \nsubprojects  are  anticipated  from  each  participating  state,  which  the  government  will  then \nconsolidate, if applicable, and forward to ADB in the form of periodic financing requests (PFRs). \nThe selection criteria set out in the FFA apply to the subprojects to be financed under the \nsecond tranche onwards and the subprojects under tranche 1 have substantially followed these \ncriteria. The first PFR covering the respective first batches of two participating states with \nadvanced project readiness (i.e., Himachal Pradesh and Punjab) is processed together with the \nMFF. Five PFRs (including the first one) are anticipated under the investment program. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n17.  The  road  map  covering  the  four  participating  states  during  2011\u20132020,  which  is \nidentified as priority investment, is estimated to cost $1.69 billion,9 of which $357.14 million will \nbe financed under the investment program (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Investment Programa ($ million) \nHimachal  Tamil \nItemb  Pradesh  Punjab  Nadu  Uttarakhand  Total \nA.

About \n13 subprojects of such nature, with each subproject typically having eight to ten different activities and costing \nabout $0.7 million on an average, are proposed to be undertaken in Punjab under the investment program. \nb There are a number of consulting service packages, each of which is ideally carried out by the same team \nthroughout the investment program from 2011 to 2020 to ensure continuity. There is an option to make this long-\nterm engagement possible. Under this option, each contract covers the entire implementation period of the \ninvestment program from 2011 to 2020. The initial loan will cover the consulting service contracts partially while the \nsubsequent loan will cover the remaining balances of the contracts. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n21.  State-level empowered committee. Each state government will establish a state-level \nempowered committee, chaired by the state\u2019s chief secretary and comprising secretaries from \nline agencies, to take all decisions on behalf of the state and will (i) act as a policy making body; \n(ii) provide  overall  advice  and  guidance  to  the  state\u2019s  executing  agency  and  project \nmanagement unit (PMU); and (iii) accord all approvals under the investment program. \n \n22.  Executing agency. The Department of Tourism of each state will be the executing \nagency. All necessary powers to: (i) assume overall responsibility for the execution of the MFF; \n(ii) engage adequate permanent and fixed-term staff to implement the MFF; (iii) set up a state-\nlevel  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs);  (iv) provide \noverall strategic guidance on the implementation of the road map; and (v) ensure compliance \nwith the loan covenants and undertakings set forth in the FFA will be delegated to the respective \nexecuting agencies. \n \n23.  Implementing  agency. The Tourism Development Board, or its equivalent, of each \nstate will be the implementing agency. \n \n24.  Each PMU will be headed by a full-time project director and will consist of personnel \ndeputed from state government departments and recruited from the market. Each PMU will also \nbe  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants.  PMU  will  be  the  nodal  agency  for  the  overall \nmanagement of all activities under the investment program and will be responsible for: (i) project \nplanning and budgeting; (ii) provision of day-to-day assistance, supervision and guidance for the \nPIUs and their consultants; (iii) review of subprojects\u2019 compliance with ADB\u2019s due diligence \nrequirements and approval of subproject proposals submitted by PIUs and state government \ndepartments; (iv) bidding, evaluation and contract award; (v) management and disbursement of ", "7 \nfunds;  (vi) compliance  review  with  loan  covenants,  contract  specifications,  work  plans  and \nquality standards; (vii) consolidation of progress reports, and financial, accounting and audit \nreports; and (viii) coordination regarding matters requiring higher-level decisions of the state-\nlevel empowered committee and ADB. \n \n25.  PIUs will be established in strategic locations in each state for day-to-day management \nof works and capacity building activities. PIUs will mainly consist of engineers and experts \ndeputed from state government departments. A team of design and supervision consultants will \nbe engaged by the executing agency concerned for each PIU to strengthen its capacity. PIUs \nwill be responsible for: (i) prioritizing and preparing subproject proposals; (ii) providing day-to-\nday  assistance,  supervision  and  guidance  for  the  design  and  supervision  consultants; \n(iii) conducting detailed assessments and surveys including public consultation and input from \nstakeholders;  (iv) preparing  detailed  designs,  specifications,  schedule  of  quantity,  bidding \ndocuments,  and  related  documentation;  (v) implementing  civil  works  and  related  activities; \n(vi) reporting to PMU; (vii) preparing regular progress reports for the state-level empowered \ncommittee,  the  executing  agency  and  ADB  through  PMU;  (viii) supervising  construction, \nconducting quality control, approving progress payments to contractors; and (ix) maintaining \nrecords and accounts on an up-to-date basis and making these available to ADB for inspection. \n \n26.  Phase 2 of the technical assistance for Preparing the Inclusive Tourism Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project, which focuses on implementation capacity development support to the \nparticipating states, will cover the initial start-up period of the proposed investment program until \n31  August  2011  (footnote  7).  In  addition  to  the  usual  project  administration  support,  the \nconsultants will assist the PMUs and PIUs in the formulation of (i) mobility plans; (ii) possible \npublic\u2013private  partnership  schemes;  and  (iii) community  participation  and  capacity  building \nschemes, including promotion schemes for homestay programs and bed and breakfast facilities, \nand training for community-based tourism activities, while letting the staff, private sector parties, \nand communities be exposed to international best practices. Loan-funded consultants will then \ntake over the task of implementation support and capacity building for the PMUs and PIUs. \nADB\u2019s  India  Resident  Mission  will  also  provide  strong  project  administration  support,  in \nparticular during the initial start-up period. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  Support  with  respect  to  planning  exercises  would  be  necessary,  particularly  in \naddressing  key  issues  such  as  (i) peak-period  visitor  safety  concerns;  (ii) greenfield \ndevelopment at prospective tourist destinations, focusing on proper planning and regulations; \nand (iii) mobility and public transport planning in congested areas or mountainous terrain where \nthe scope of physical infrastructure improvements is limited, in particular focusing on possible \nadoption of innovative new solutions (i.e., the use of information technology, etc.). In addition, \npublic\u2013private partnership contract packaging will be explored in consideration of particular local \nconditions, market conditions, and the level of interest by potential bidders. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n28.  The economic analysis has reviewed11 the following aspects of the investment program: \n(i) the economic rationale for government intervention, (ii) goals, (iii) sector development plans, \n                                                 \n11 Analysis on the investment program was carried out in accordance with D. Dole. 2005. Assessing Aid for a Sector \nDevelopment Plan: Economic Analysis of a Sector Loan. ERD Technical Note. No. 14. Manila: ADB. \n ", "8 \n(iv) associated economic policies, (v) economic risks, (vi) each state government\u2019s capacity, (vii) \nfiscal impact, (viii) each state government\u2019s commitment, (ix) coordination of foreign aid, and (x) \nconditions attached to the loan. The economic rationale for government intervention is justified, \nsince the investment program supports basic public services characterized by monopolistic \nconditions, externality management, and impacts on income distribution. \n \n29.  In principle, the participating states will ensure that admission and user fees of tourist \nfacilities created or rehabilitated under the investment program are set at levels sufficient to \nmake  their  operation  financially  sustainable.  Some  participating  states  intend  to  levy  user \ncharges on certain subprojects, such as adaptive reuse of publicly owned heritage buildings for \ncommercial purposes. However, most subprojects either cannot earn sufficient revenues or \ndirectly generate revenues. The participating states will, therefore, ensure that adequate funds \nare provided to meet any shortfall between the costs and revenues for the operation and \nmaintenance of those tourist facilities. Most of the proposed subprojects in Himachal Pradesh \nand Punjab under the first PFR are not revenue earning, but the forecast increases in tourist \nvisits and incremental tourist spending from longer length of stay will generate higher sales tax \nrevenues. The additional budgetary requirements created by the subprojects will not be a \nsignificant burden for those states, considering their revenue surplus since FY2009. \n \n30.  The  proposed  subprojects  in  Himachal  Pradesh  and  Punjab  under  the  first  PFR \ngenerate economic benefits in the form of additional tourist spending from the increases in \ntourist volumes and length of stay, and increased revenues from sales taxes due to additional \ninternational tourist spending. Other quantifiable and unquantifiable economic benefits are also \nexpected in the form of enhanced environmental quality and improved access (less travel time \nand vehicle operating costs). Based on the estimated economic benefits, the economic internal \nrates of return for the subprojects under the first PFR were estimated at 14.1% for Himachal \nPradesh and 22.3% for Punjab.   \n \nC.  Governance \n31.  There  is  a  need  to  strengthen  the  financial  management  and  overall  project \nimplementation capacities of the executing agencies and implementing agencies. The financial \nmanagement assessment of the investment program showed that there were common financial \nmanagement  challenges  in  the  implementing  agencies  of  each  state,  which  include \n(i) procedures for internal audit; (ii) cash-basis accounting; and (iii) computerization of financial \nmanagement processes. As part of the project management consultancy, financial specialists \nhave been included to assist in (i) strengthening internal audit procedures; (ii) studying the \nadoption of accrual-basis (if applicable, double-entry) accounting, and (iii) computerizing the \nproject accounting system. Further strengthening of the overall governance will also be explored \nby  facilitating  sound  partnership  arrangements  among  sector  agencies,  local  business \ncommunities, and local civil societies. These will be addressed during the proposed investment \nprogram through the capacity building programs for sector agencies. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Department of Tourism of each state. Specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The poverty and social assessment conducted during investment program preparation \nindicates that poor and marginalized people require skills training and credit for tourism-based ", "9 \nlivelihood development. The investment program design, therefore, proposes tourist destination \nenhancement  with  community  participatory  activities  that  support  training  and  local \nentrepreneurship to channel economic benefits directly to the surrounding communities. Poor \npeople in these communities will, therefore, benefit from the prospective interventions through \nexpanded tourism-related business opportunities, generation of new employment, improved \nliving conditions for the local populations, and an increased stake in the management of natural \nand cultural tourism resources. A participation plan under the investment program will facilitate \nsuch  local  efforts.  The  gender  analysis  conducted  during  investment  program  preparation \nindicates that the sector can provide opportunities for women to participate at all levels. A \ngender action plan was prepared to ensure inclusive social impacts. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n34.  Environment.  Project  1  is  classified  environmental  category  B  and  two  initial \nenvironmental examinations with environmental management plans were prepared in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The initial environmental examinations conclude \nthat no significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated, and any impacts during the \ndesign  and  construction  stages  are  readily  addressed  through  mitigation  measures.  Key \nenvironmental benefits include improved on-site and off-site hygiene and sanitary conditions at \ntourist destinations, and enhanced conservation through alternative livelihood opportunities in \necotourism and increased environmental awareness. All subprojects are consistent with approved \nenvironmental management plans (which aim to conserve natural tourist attractions) and with \ngovernment environmental regulations. An environmental assessment and review framework was \nprepared to guide environmental assessment in subsequent loans to ensure there are no adverse \nimpacts. \n \n35.  Social.  Project  1  is  classified  involuntary  resettlement  category  C  and  indigenous \npeoples category C. Subprojects under project 1 do not result in any physical or economic \ndisplacement due to involuntary acquisition of land, or involuntary restrictions on land use, or \nmore specifically access to the Pong or Keshopur sanctuaries. All land parcels required for \nthese subprojects are owned by the respective state governments or implementing agencies. \nThere  are  no  indigenous  peoples  in  the  subproject  areas  under  project  1.  Because  no \ninvoluntary resettlement or impact on indigenous peoples is expected under these subprojects, \nno social safeguards planning documents have been prepared. A resettlement framework and \nan indigenous peoples planning framework have been prepared for future loans, which detail \nscreening  and  categorization,  assessment,  planning,  and  institutional  arrangements  and \nprocesses to be followed.12 Implementation arrangements ensure that PMUs and PIUs have \nadequate capacity to manage social impacts through consultant support and capacity building. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measure \nLower demand for tourism due to  Promoting tourism as a government policy priority \nadverse economic conditions \nLimited institutional capacity for  Provision of grant-funded and loan-funded consultants for implementation \nimplementation  support and capacity building \nProject implementation delays  Establishment of project management units and project implementation units \nwith qualified staff supported by consultants, and implementation capacity \n                                                 \n12 Resettlement Framework; Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisk  Mitigating Measure \ndevelopment and project administration support from the India Resident \nMission \nDegradation of quality of natural  Supporting the preparation and implementation of management plans for \nand cultural tourist attractions due  natural and cultural heritage sites, including mobility planning \nto increased number of tourists \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n37.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n38.  The government and the Department of Tourism, or its equivalent, of each state have \ngiven ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants \nagreed by the government and the Department of Tourism, or its equivalent, of each state with \nrespect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreement and project \nagreement for the respective tranches. \n \n39.  For each \u201ctourist trail\u201d subproject, the relevant PMU will prepare and submit a mobility \nplan before the finalization and issuance of bidding documents to ensure the convenience and \nsafety  of  tourists.  The  mobility  plans  must  cover,  among  other  subjects,  public  transport, \npossible pedestrianization (permanent or time-bound) of certain trails, and, where relevant, \nevent and crowd management plans for peak periods (e.g., festival periods, auspicious periods \nfor pilgrimage). \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $250,000,000 to India for the Infrastructure Development Investment \nProgram for Tourism from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \nframework financing agreement presented to the Board.  \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n6 September 2010 ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets and Indicators with Baselinesa  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nReporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact  By MFF completion:  State tourism  Assumption \nEnhanced  \uf02d  50% increase in local employment created by  statistics  Participating states are \ncontribution of the  tourism in each participating state (target: 30%  State economic and  committed to \ntourism sector to  women)   employment  sustainable tourism \nsustainable and  \uf02d  30% increase in aggregate contribution of tourism to  statistics  development. \ninclusive economic  the gross domestic product of each participating  Risk \ngrowth  state.
