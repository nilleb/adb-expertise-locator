An initial environmental examination was completed.  \nAssessment\nSocial Category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \nAssessment indigenous peoples. \nProject Description  The  Green  Power  Development  Project  has  two  components: \n(i) regional clean power trade, and (ii) renewable energy access \nfor  the  poor.  Under  the  first  component,  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower development (a 114-megawatt [MW] run-of-river type) \naims to export power from Bhutan to India through the existing \ngrid  to  India.  The  rural  electrification  component  will  provide \naccess  to  electricity  sourced  from  hydropower  to  8,767 \nhouseholds  and  facilities  with  grid  extensions,  and  electricity \nsourced from solar energy to 119 remote public facilities (e.g., \nschools, health clinics, and other community facilities) on an off-\ngrid basis. \nThe Dagachhu hydropower development will be promoted by a \njoint venture company between Druk Green Power Corporation \n(DGPC)  in  Bhutan  and  Tata  Power  Company  (TPC)  in  India \nthrough  a  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP).  The  rural \nelectrification component will be mainly served by Bhutan Power \nCorporation (BPC), a public utility service company.  \nRationale Bhutan has substantial clean and renewable hydropower capacity. \nTheoretical potential hydropower is 26,760 MW\u2014only about 6% is \nbeing used. Of the total 1,500 MW installed, 80% is exported to \nIndia after meeting domestic consumption. Power exports account \nfor the largest source of Government revenue in the form of taxes \nand dividends from hydropower companies. Despite the nation\u2019s \nnet power surplus for export, most rural residents do not have \naccess to electricity. Only 40% of rural households use electricity \nas their main source of lighting as compared to 96.4% of urban \nhouseholds. Expansion of rural electrification will provide access \nto  more  remote  rural  areas  where  the  costs  of  investment, \noperation, and maintenance will be higher due to low population ", "ii\ndensity and unfavorable terrain.\nSince about 70% of the population lives in rural areas, electricity \nfor  all  is  a  significant  implementation  challenge.  Operating \nsubsidies are essential to ensure the sustainability of expanding \nrural  electrification.  In  Bhutan,  subsidies  are  regulated  and \nprovided  from  royalty  revenues  yielded  from  power  exports  to \ncross-subsidize electricity prices, in particular for rural domestic \ncustomers.  The  Government  distributes  the  remaining  power \nexport revenues to support socioeconomic goals, such as health \nand education, as well as infrastructure development, e.g., rural \nroads  and  bridges.  Thus,  rural  electrification  and  hydropower \nexport are strongly interrelated with inclusive economic growth \nand poverty reduction. Expanding generation capacity for export \nand  rural  access  to  electricity  will  enhance  energy  and  social \nsecurity. \nThe Government aims for (i) 100% electrification by 2013, and \n(ii)  an  additional  10,000  MW  of  hydropower  development  and \ntrading by 2020. In rural areas, electricity from hydropower and \nsolar sources will replace kerosene and fuelwood. Given the coal-\ndominated Indian power market, clean energy development for \npower export will promote low-carbon energy sources and foster \neconomic cooperation in the South Asia region. \nAccelerating  the  development  of  hydropower  for  export  is  of \nstrategic  significance  for  Bhutan\u2019s  economy.  Given  the \nGovernment\u2019s  limited  fiscal  capacity  for  large  infrastructure \nprojects,  the  hydropower  development  strategy  is  to  leverage \npublic  and  private  investments  through  private  participation  in \ndevelopment projects. This approach is expected to accelerate \nhydropower  development,  and  generate  income  for  more \nsocioeconomic development. To promote the country\u2019s strategy, \nthe project preparatory technical assistance (TA) supported the \nGovernment in establishing a policy and institutional framework \nfor public and private participation in hydropower development. \nThe Dagachhu hydropower development is a demonstration PPP \nfacility in line with the Hydropower Development Policy, which is \nto  promote  private  and  foreign  investments  for  hydropower \ngeneration  in  Bhutan.  Further  TA  support  will  be  provided  to \ndevelop Government capacity for hydropower export. \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is to sustain the country\u2019s inclusive \neconomic  growth  by  promoting  cross-border  power  trade  and \nelectricity access. As an outcome, the power sector is to improve \nthe coverage of distribution and expand electricity export through \nclean power development in a sustainable manner. Investment for \nDagachhu hydropower will generate a long-term revenue stream \nfor Bhutan to finance its enormous development needs in social \ninfrastructure, such as health and education, as well as economic \ninfrastructure facilities like roads and electricity supplies. They will ", "iii\nform the basis of rural development and poverty reduction in the \ncountry. Investment for rural electrification will improve access to \nelectricity by rural households and small businesses, and replace \nmore  expensive  and  polluting  kerosene  and  fuelwood  with \nrenewable  hydropower  and  solar  energy.  It  will  make  social \ninterventions to the poor and improve the standard of living and \nquality  of  life  of  people  living  in  rural  areas.  The  Dagachhu \ndevelopment will generate export revenues, which will be used for \nsubsidies  to  maintain  low-cost  power  supplies  to  rural \nelectrification, while exporting power to India through which cross-\nborder  cooperation  and  regional  energy  efficiency  will  be \nenhanced.\nOutput Regional  Clean  Power  Trade.  The  Dagachhu  hydropower \ndevelopment will be a 114 MW run-of-river, with minimal adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts. Generated power will be sold to \nIndia through the existing grid connected to India. As the first \nundertaking  of  a  commercial  nature  in  Bhutan,  the  Dagachhu \nplant will be developed through PPP to leverage private capital \nand maximize the impacts of the government investment. DGPC \n(a  Bhutanese  state-owned  company)  and  TPC  (Indian  private \npower  company)  agreed  to  a  joint  venture  arrangement,  and \nDagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (DHPC) was incorporated as \nthe project special purpose company. The Government envisages \nthat the Dagachhu development will be a pilot case to catalyze \nprivate  participation  and  accelerate  hydropower  development. \nSince  the  Dagachhu  development  has  applied  for  the  United \nNations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  under  the \nClean Development Mechanism (CDM) as defined in the Kyoto \nProtocol, it will be a showcase cross-border CDM project. These \noutputs will help create a competitive investment environment in \nregional power trading and clean energy development.  \nRenewable Energy Access for the Poor. The rural electrification \nsystem  will  be  extended  to  provide  clean  and  reliable  power \nsupply to rural areas mainly in seven districts of Bhutan. It will \nelectrify  8,767  domestic  households  and  facilities  in  remote \ncentral and eastern regions. In addition to the grid extension, 119 \nsolar  photovoltaic  systems,  using  an  emerging  energy-efficient \ntechnology, will be installed to support electrification in isolated \noff-grid rural areas, especially schools, health clinics, monasteries, \nand other community facilities.   \nProject Investment Plan The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $234.45 million, \nincluding  contingencies  and  financing  charges,  comprising \n$201.47 million for regional clean power trade, and $32.98 million \nequivalent for renewable energy access for the poor.  \nFinancing Plan  Regional  Clean  Power  Trade.  The  Dagachhu  hydropower \ndevelopment  will  cost  $201.47  million,  including  debt  of \n$121.47 million (60%) and equity of $80.0 million (40%). ADB will ", "iv\nfinance $80 million as anchor money to take a lead in the financial \nstructuring. The Kingdom of Bhutan will be the borrower of the \nADB loans from ordinary capital resources (OCR) and hard-term \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF).  Of  the  $80  million,  ADB  will \nprovide $51 million (OCR) to the debt portion of the Dagachhu \ndevelopment,  and  $29  million  (hard-term  ADF)  to  the  equity \nportion through lending to the Government. The entire equity will \nbe  funded  through  Bhutan\u2019s  public  sector  including  the \nGovernment, DGPC, and National Pension and Provident Fund \n(NPPF); and the Indian private company, TPC. The debt balance \nis expected to be cofinanced by the Austrian Export Credit Agency \n(ECA) ($55.46 million) and NPPF ($15 million).  \nRenewable  Energy  Access  for  the  Poor.  The ADB grant of \n$25.28 million equivalent from the ADF will support the on-grid \ncomponent for rural electrification. The Government will finance \nthe balance of $6.64 million equivalent. The Asian Clean Energy \nFund  (ACEF)  established  by  the  Government  of  Japan  and \nadministered by the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \n(CEFPF) is expected to provide an additional grant cofinancing of \n$1.00 million for the off-grid component for rural electrification.  \nFinancing Plan\n($ million) \nDagachhu  Rural\nSource Hydropower  Electrification  Total \nADB \n     OCR loan    51.00    51.00 \n     Hard-term ADF loan  29.00     29.00 \n     ADF grant    25.28  25.28 \nACEF under CEFPFa     1.00  1.00a\n  Subtotal  80.00  26.28  106.28 \nAustrian ECA  55.46    55.46 \nGovernmentb 45.01  6.70  51.71 \nTata Power Company  21.00  21.00\nTotal  201.47  32.98  234.45 \nACEF = Asian Clean Energy Fund, ADB = Asian Development Bank, CEFPF = \nClean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, ECA = export credit agency. \na Subject to approval from the Government of Japan. \nb Includes the Government-owned company (DGPC) and fund (NPPF). \nA loan of $51,000,000 from ADB\u2019s OCR will be provided under \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility. The loan will have a 30-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. \nA loan of $29,000,000 will be provided under terms for hard-term \nloans from the ADF.

DOE will be responsible for overall execution and \ncoordination  of  the  rural  electrification  component.  The \nimplementing  agencies\u2014BPC  (for  the  on-grid  component)  and \nDOE  (for  the  off-grid  component)\u2014will  undertake  project \nimplementation and administration for their respective areas.  \nProcurement  Civil works, materials, and goods to be financed by ADB will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines\n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  following  international ", "vi\nand/or  national  competitive  bidding.  Advanced  contracting  is \nendorsed to facilitate timely procurement and implementation. \nConsulting Services  The off-grid rural electrification package will include small-scale \nconsultant services to support DOE in implementing procurement \nand installation of solar panels. Consultants will be selected and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and individual \nexperts will be recruited based on biodata submitted in specific \nterms of reference for assignments. \nProject Benefits and  The  first  PPP  modality  demonstrated  by  the  Dagachhu \nBeneficiaries hydropower development will be catalytic for future public and \nprivate  investment  in  Bhutan.  Coupled  with  the  Hydropower \nDevelopment Policy, clean and renewable energy development \nand  trade  will  be  promoted  for  the  country\u2019s  and  region\u2019s \neconomic benefits.    \nIn accordance with the Tariff Determination Regulations 2006, the \nroyalty revenue yielded from power export from the Dagachhu \ndevelopment will be used to subsidize electricity for rural domestic \ncustomers,  in  particular  under  a  lifeline  tariff.  Since  the \nGovernment estimates that more than 90% of the poor live in rural \nareas,  rural  electrification  will  contribute  significantly  to \nsocioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction  for  about \n9,000 households and 55,000 residents, representing almost 10% \nof  the  national  population.  Rural  electrification  is  expected  to \ncreate  opportunities  for  alternate  income-earning  avenues  and \ndevelopment  of  rural  industries,  and  improve  access  to  social \nservices such as education and health. After implementation of \nthe component, the national rural electrification ratio is expected \nto be increased to 84% from the current 60%. \nPower exports will increase the Government\u2019s revenue base and \nenable  it  to  allocate  more  resources  to  socioeconomic \ndevelopment including health, education, and rural electrification. \nIn 2006/07, revenues from power exports contributed to all the \nexpenditures for the agriculture and social sectors (e.g., health \nand education). During the next five-year plan, the Government \nconsiders that revenues from hydropower development will be the \nmajor sources to directly improve social quality of life and reduce \npoverty. Incremental income from power exports will be used for \nimproving  and  expanding  road  and  bridge  infrastructure  to \npromote rural development for poverty reduction. The enhanced \ninfrastructure  will  encourage  tourism,  agribusiness,  and \ncommunication; and thus contribute to inclusive economic growth. \nIt will also encourage private sector operations and help create \nnew employment opportunities.\nIn Bhutan, wood is still predominately used for fuel, especially by \nthe poor (with 83% of total consumption); electricity and gas are ", "vii\nwidely  used  for  cooking  by  urban  residents  (90%).  Rural \nhouseholds  in  nonelectrified  villages  depend  on  kerosene  for \nlighting. Therefore, access to electricity sourced from hydropower \nand  solar  will  have  significant  positive  environmental  impacts, \nsuch  as  reduced  use  of  fossil  fuels  and  deforestation  due  to \nfirewood harvesting. Export of the clean power surplus will lower \ngreenhouse gas emissions (500,000 tons per year) of the coal-\ndominated Indian power market.\nRisks and Assumptions Dagachhu Hydropower. The main external risks relate to off-take \nand CDM. The first risk will be mitigated by a 25-year power \npurchase agreement with Tata Power Trading Company (TPTC). \nThe agreement has a constant escalation, which will make the \ntariff  revision  risk  minimal.  The  small  size  of  the  114  MW \nDagachhu generation capacity will likely be absorbed by the vast \npower  demand\u2013supply  gap  in  India.  Second,  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower  development  is  based  on  the  assumption  that \nadditional cash flows will be generated from the sale of carbon \nemission reductions, however, the nature of a post-2012 CDM \nframework  is  as  yet  unknown.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  this \nuncertainty, DHPC and TPTC have in principle agreed for the \npurchase of the emission reductions to be underwritten by TPTC \nover the 30 year duration at a specific minimum price.  \nPotential risks for the Dagachhu development include (i) increase \nin prices of civil works and equipment, and (ii) delays in project \nimplementation and operation. The cost and time overrun risks \nare  to  be  mitigated  by  contractual  warranties  in  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contracts. Sufficient physical and \nprice contingencies have been considered for any increase in the \nequipment and civil works costs. The implementation capacity of \nthe  development  sponsors  will  also  be  important.  The  main \ndeveloper,  DGPC,  has  implemented  hydropower  projects  with \nvarious  agencies  and  is  operating  four  hydropower  plants  in \nBhutan. DHPC is adequately staffed with personnel experienced \nin executing hydropower projects. This will minimize the risk of \ncost and time overruns, along with a PPP arrangement with TPC, \na joint venture partner, with extensive experience in implementing \nand operating hydropower projects worldwide. The Government of \nAustria  will  fund  TA  to  strengthen  DHPC\u2019s  capacity  for \nimplementation and supervision during construction. \nRural Electrification. Potential risks include (i) increase in cost of \nconstruction materials and transportation due to higher fuel prices, \n(ii) construction delays due to procurement and contract awards, \nand (iii) difficult accessibility due to undeveloped access roads. \nThese risks are to be mitigated by (i) adequate physical and price \ncontingencies  and  cost  estimates  based  on  2008  actual  bid \nprices,  (ii)  advance  procurement  action,  and  (iii)  integration  of \nroad  development  plans  in  rural  electrification  programs.  The \nGovernment has firmly committed support for implementation and ", "viii\ncounterpart funding.  \nTechnical Assistance  A  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (CDTA)  will  be \nattached to the Project. The Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership Facility will provide a grant of $888,000 and the ADB \nTA  funding  program  will  provide  $600,000,  for  a  total  of \n$1,488,000.  The  CDTA  for  Promotion  of  Clean  Power  Export \nDevelopment aims to (i) develop capacity (e.g., risk management \nand  project  structuring,  and  public  and  private  participation \npromotion) for DOE, DGPC, and Druk Holding and Investments; \n(ii) conduct a financial structuring study for medium-size power \nexport  projects;  and  (iii)  prepare  project  design  document(s) \naccessing CDM funding sources. The CDTA will support DOE in \npromoting  investment  solicitation,  due  diligence,  and  financing \nplans for the demonstration projects. ", "", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.

The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1.   \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n1.  Sector Overview \n2.  Bhutan is the only South Asian country with a surplus of power for export. Almost \n100%  of  power  generated  in  the  country  is  hydropower\u2014the  most  productive  natural \nresource in Bhutan. The mountainous terrain and network of perennially flowing rivers and \nstreams  provide  an  abundant  source  of  clean  and  renewable  energy.  Bhutan  has  27 \nhydropower stations comprising 4 major hydroelectric power plants, 12 minihydro plants, \nand 10 microhydro plants, with a total installed capacity of about 1,500 megawatts (MW). \nBecause generation is significantly greater than the 157 MW of domestic demand, Bhutan is \na net power exporter. \n3.  Of total power generated, 80% is exported to India. Power exports account for the \nlargest source of Government revenue in the form of taxes and dividends from hydropower \ncompanies. Given the production of an additional 1,020 MW from the Tala hydropower plant \ncommissioned in July 2006, the power sector accounts for more than 40% of national \nrevenue and 25% of gross domestic product (GDP). Hydropower infrastructure development \ncontributes another 25% of GDP through the construction sector.    \n4.  Real GDP grew at an annual average of over 7% during the Government\u2019s 9th Five-\nYear Plan (FYP) (2002\u20132007). While hydropower is a key driver of economic growth, the \nBhutanese  economy  has  strong  linkages  with  the  Indian  market.  Because  Bhutan\u2019s \ncurrency, the ngultrum, is pegged to the Indian rupee at par, local prices in Bhutan generally \nreflect inflationary movements in India. During the past 5 years, 92% of imports and exports \nwere from and to India. Among all trading commodities, power export is a major foreign \nexchange earner. During the 10th FYP (2008\u20132013), the Government intends to expand \nhydropower  development  for  export.  An  increasing  power  shortage  in  the  South  Asian \nregion represents a significant power-trading opportunity.  \n5.  Despite the net power surplus for export, most rural residents do not have access to \nelectricity. Only 40% of rural households use electricity as their main source of lighting as \ncompared to 96.4% of urban households.2 The Government aimed for 100% electrification \nby 2020 as outlined in Vision 2020, Electricity for All. The Rural Electrification Master Plan \ntargeted  increasing  the  electrification  ratio  from  60%  to  84%  under  the  10th  FYP.3 It \n                                                          \n1  Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. \n2  National Statistics Bureau. 2005. The Population and Housing Census of Bhutan 2005. Thimphu. Rural \nhouseholds depend on kerosene (51.3%) for lighting, firewood (2.6%), and solar energy (2.5%).  \n3  The Government met the target of 52% during the 9th FYP, achieving an overall electrification ratio of 60%.  ", "2\nidentified all nonelectrified villages and provided on-grid and off-grid electrification plans \nbased on economic cost\u2013benefit analysis.4 Of the 1,716 nonelectrified villages identified, at \nleast 857 will be electrified under 10th FYP. Now the Government has revised the target to \nachieve 100% electrification during the 10th FYP.5\n6.  Considering that about 70% of the country\u2019s population lives in rural areas, providing \nelectricity for all will be a significant implementation challenge. Further expansion of rural \nelectrification  will  cover  more  remote  areas,  where  operation  and  maintenance  will  be \ncostlier. Experiences with rural electrification indicate that overall electricity consumption will \nincrease as rural households acquire new appliances and increase reliance on electricity \nuse,  and  rural  economies  develop.  Even  now,  per  capita  consumption  of  all  energy \n(including  fuelwood)  in  Bhutan  is  the  highest  in  South  Asia.6 Therefore,  continuous \ngeneration addition and export will be promoted to (i) meet the increasing demand, (ii) \nreduce fuelwood consumption and conserve the forest environment, and (iii) provide cross-\nsubsidies to sustain costlier rural electrification supply through export revenues. Energy \nsecurity will involve expanding generation capacity and providing rural access to electricity.  \n2.  Institutional Overview \n7.  The Electricity Act, 2001, deals with restructuring the power sector. In 2002, the \nGovernment restructured the Department of Power of the Ministry of Trade and Industry into \nthe (i) Department of Energy (DOE) as the Government\u2019s policy and planning agency; and \n(ii)  Bhutan  Power  Corporation  (BPC)  as  the  utility  service  company  responsible  for \ntransmission,  distribution,  and  supply  of  electricity  within  the  country.  DOE  under  the \nrenamed Ministry of Economic Affairs continues to be the nodal agency for all planning and \ncoordination activities for the energy sector. \n8.  The Government is focusing on second-generation reforms to improve the capacity \nand efficiency of hydropower generation. Bhutan has four major power stations: (i) Chhukha \nHydro Power Corporation (336 MW), (ii) Basochhu Hydro Power Corporation (64 MW), (iii) \nTala Hydroelectric Project Authority (1,020 MW), and (iv) Kurichhu Hydro Power Corporation \n(60 MW). Three are located in the western region; the Kurichhu power plant supplies the \ncentral and eastern regions. The Tala power plant, established as a joint venture with the \nGovernment of India, will be fully owned by the Government of Bhutan in 2009. The other \nthree companies are wholly Government-owned and were amalgamated to form Druk Green \nPower Corporation (DGPC) in January 2008. To optimize resources and maximize efficiency, \nthe  Government  established  DGPC  as  a  holding  company  to  oversee  its  interests  in \nhydropower companies and projects, and to accelerate new hydropower development.7\n9.  Under the Electricity Act, Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA) was set up as the sector \nregulator in 2002,8 and since then has been regularly revising the tariff structure. In 2007, \n                                                          \n4  Only the villages with an economic internal rate of return of 12% were considered viable for grid-based rural \nelectrification; the rest will be provided with electricity through off-grid options. \n5  The country\u2019s first election resulted in the formation of a new government in April 2008.  \n6  The energy sector encompasses more than the generation of electric power. In Bhutan, consumption of \nfuelwood is about 1,200 kg per capita per year, which is the highest consumption worldwide (twice as high as \nin Nepal). Fuelwood accounts for about 77% of total energy consumption. Recent evaluations show that \nelectrification reduces fuelwood consumption by 25%\u201335%.    \n7  ADB.  2003.

BEA \nissued  separate  tariff  structures  for  low-voltage,  medium-voltage,  and  high-voltage \nconsumers, in accordance with the Tariff Determination Regulations, 2006. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Sector Development Strategy  \n10. Regional Economic Growth and Cooperation. In July 2006, the governments of \nBhutan and India signed an umbrella agreement with a mutual obligation to develop and \ntrade at least 5,000 MW of hydropower generation by 2020. The two governments further \nagreed in principle to increase this target to 10,000 MW by 2020. Hydropower development \nand export have steadfastly underpinned rapid growth of Bhutan\u2019s economy and generated \nvaluable  resources  for  social  and  other  investments.  Therefore,  accelerating  the \ndevelopment of hydropower for export will be of strategic significance to the economy. The \nrevenues from power export will provide a cross-subsidy to maintain low-cost power supply \nto  domestic  customers,  making  the  power  industry  environmentally,  economically,  and \nfinancially sustainable.  \n11.  Bhutan\u2019s potential hydropower is 26,760 MW, 6% of which is being used to meet \ndomestic consumption and the reminder is for export. On the other hand, the northern and \nwestern regions of India are experiencing a large power supply deficit and are shifting \nelectricity from the eastern and northeastern regions within the country. The scenario of a \npower surplus in Bhutan and supply deficit in India is expected to enhance mutual interest in \ndeveloping hydropower projects in Bhutan and exporting electricity to India. Clean energy \ndevelopment  for  power  export  will  improve  energy  efficiency  and  foster  economic \ncooperation in the region.  \n12.  Bilateral assistance has supported the development of all hydropower projects in \nBhutan. The major hydropower export projects at Chhukha (336 MW) and Tala (1,020 MW) \nwere developed through bilateral assistance from the Government of India. In 2007, the two \ngovernments signed an agreement for jointly developing the next project at Punatsangchhu \n(1,095 MW at stage I). A number of large hydropower projects with more than 500 MW are \nplanned for development under the two governments\u2019 partnership.  \n13. Private Sector Participation. In addition to bilateral arrangements, the development \nstrategy  will  require  considering  various  financing  mechanisms  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships  (PPPs)  and/or  independent  power  producers.  Exploitation  of  hydropower \npotential  is  constrained  by  high  up-front  investments  and  large  funding  arrangements. \nBecause  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  capacity  for  big  infrastructure  projects  is  limited,  the \nhydropower  development  strategy  will  leverage  public  and  private  investments  through \nprivate participation in the development, in particular for medium and small size projects. \nSuch an approach is expected to accelerate hydropower development, restrain Government \nexpenditure, and generate income from export revenues.\n14. Inclusive  Growth.  Income  from  power  export  will  increase  the  Government\u2019s \nrevenue base and enable it to allocate more resources for socioeconomic development \nincluding health, education, and rural electrification. Additional resources could be used to \nimprove  and  expand  road  and  bridge  infrastructure  to  promote  rural  development  and \nreduce  poverty.  The  enhanced  infrastructure  will  encourage  tourism,  agribusiness, ", "4\ncommunication, and urban development; and thus contribute to inclusive economic growth. \nIt will also encourage private sector operations and create new employment opportunities.   \n15.  Supplying rural areas with access to electricity will improve the living standards of the \nrural population. Since the Government estimates that more than 90% of the poor live in \nrural areas,9 the goal of 100% electrification will contribute significantly to socioeconomic \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction  by  promoting  local  economic  development.  Rural \nelectrification is expected to create opportunities for alternate income-earning avenues and \ndevelopment of rural industries. It will also improve access to social services such as \neducation and health. Rural electrification thus provides social interventions and benefits.     \n16. Financial and Economic Sustainability. Rural electrification projects often require \noperating  subsidy  inputs  to  ensure  sustainability.  Currently  the  subsidies  for  rural \nelectrification are provided through (i) sale of power from generation companies to BPC at a \nrate  that  is  less  than  the  cost  of  production,  and  (ii)  cross-subsidies  from  the  sale  of \nelectricity to large industrial customers. Under the Tariff Regulations, the regulator, BEA, \nintends to effectively cap the total subsidy available from the sale of power, and require \npayment at the full cost of power sales to India for all local consumption in excess of 15% of \nBhutan\u2019s current hydropower generation capability. This means the subsidy will adequately \ncover low-voltage rural domestic customers below the lifeline tariff, with medium- and high-\nvoltage customers paying the full cost of supply. \n17. Environmental  Sustainability.  One-fourth  of  the  national  land  comprises \nenvironmentally protected areas, including four national parks, one natural reserve, and four \nwildlife sanctuaries. The country\u2019s forest, which covers more than 70% of the land, is also \nprotected. Bhutan\u2019s strong environmental conservation policies have affected the pace of \nimplementing power projects because of the time required to complete procedures such as \nenvironmental  impact  assessments,  public  consultations,  forestry  clearances,  and  road \nplanning. Nevertheless, the priority concerns for the environment relate to protection of \nwatersheds, forests, and the ecosystem. All the existing hydropower project sites are run-of-\nriver, with less environmental and social impacts compared to economic benefits. In remote \nand isolated rural areas, solar panel systems have been installed. In spite of the efforts, \nwood is still predominately used in rural villages (83% of total consumption), while electricity \nand gas are widely used for cooking by 90% of urban residents. Rural households in \nnonelectrified  villages  depend  on  kerosene  for  lighting.  Therefore,  access  to  electricity \nsourced from hydropower will have significant positive environmental impacts by reducing \nfossil fuel use and deforestation due to firewood harvesting. Export of clean power surplus \nwill lower greenhouse gas emissions in the coal-dominated Indian power market. Global \nwarming is critical to Bhutan since a potential environmental hazard is a glacial lake outburst \nfrom the Himalaya Mountains, which will influence the long-term viability of hydropower \nprojects that are on rivers fed by glacial lakes.   \n2.  ADB Operations and External Assistance \n18. ADB Sector Strategy. Power sector development is a major element of the ADB \ncountry partnership strategy for Bhutan.10 During the past decade, ADB has supported the \nGovernment in expanding rural electrification and implementing power sector reforms. The \n                                                          \n9  National Statistical Bureau. 2007. The Poverty Analysis Report, 2007. Thimphu.

", "5\nsecond generation reforms will focus on efficiency improvement of hydropower generation, \nwhile  extending  rural  electrification  to  more  remote  areas  using  hydropower  and  other \nrenewable sources. ADB will support the Government in achieving the sector targets: 100% \nrural  electrification  by  2013,  and  10,000  MW  hydropower  export  by  2020.  These  new \ninitiatives will be aligned with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy \n2020). Strategy 2020 refocuses ADB operations on three development agendas: inclusive \neconomic  growth,  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  regional  integration.11 ADB\u2019s \nCharter, which would sustain support for cross-border infrastructure development, assigns \nhigh priority to regional cooperation. The ADB\u2019s Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nand Carbon Market Initiative are expected to be used to leverage resources to promote \nenergy efficiency, and renewable and clean energy in Bhutan. The assessment of the power \nsector is in Appendix 2. \n19. Lessons. ADB has supported Bhutan in expanding rural electrification through three \nconsecutive loans since 1995, covering more than 20,400 households. The first two loan \nprojects  were  delayed  by  1\u20132  years  because  of  procurement  and  logistic  problems, \ninexperienced  local  contractors,  and  force  majeure  of  heavy  rains.  Nevertheless,  the \ncompleted projects are rated successful based on a review of relevance, effectiveness, \nefficacy,  and  sustainability.  The  experience  enabled  BPC  to  complete  the  third  loan \nsatisfactorily  ahead  of  the  original  schedule  without  any  consultancy  implementation \nsupport.  ADB  has  worked  with  the  power  sector,  since  the  early  stages  of  the  sector \ndevelopment, to promote reform, improve operating efficiency, and strengthen the capacity \nof key institutions. Success is most sustainable when the sector development program \nmaintains long-term involvement and combines institutional capacity building with scaling-up \ninvestment projects to accelerate development.    \n20. External Assistance. While ADB has supported restructuring of the power sector, \ninstitutional development, and rural electrification expansion; bilateral development partners \nhave largely supported developing generation capacity through grants and soft loans. The \nGovernment  of  India  funded  and  assisted  in  constructing  three  major  power  stations: \nChhukha, Kurichhu, and Tala for export purposes. The Government of Austria supported \ndevelopment of the Basochhu hydropower plant for domestic supply, and conducted a \nfeasibility study for the proposed Dagachhu hydropower development. The governments of \nJapan and Norway supported feasibility studies for potential hydropower sites and prepared \nthe Rural Electrification Master Plan and Power System Master Plan, respectively. The \nAustria, Netherlands, and Japan governments, and ADB have been actively supporting rural \nelectrification. Bhutan still needs to access concessionary sources of external assistance to \nclose the domestic investment gap. The external assistance is summarized in Appendix 3. \n3.  Policy Dialogue \n21. Hydropower  Development  Policy  for  Private  Participation.  To  accelerate \nhydropower  development  on  a  sustainable  basis,  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (PPTA)12 supported the Government in establishing a policy and institutional \nframework for private participation, such as PPPs and independent power producers. The \nHydropower Development Policy was issued in July 2008 with provisions of (i) an energy \n                                                          \n11ADB. 2008.

", "6\nroyalty requiring a minimum of 12% of the electricity generated to be free to the Government, \nand (ii) a minimum concession period of 30 years. The key objectives of the policy are to (i) \npromote public, private, and foreign investments to accelerate development of hydropower \ngeneration in a competitive manner; (ii) maximize benefits from hydropower generation for \nsocioeconomic development of the country; (iii) assure energy security for domestic demand \nand overall development of the sector; (iv) establish the renewable energy fund for the \nsector  development  and  operational  sustainability;  and  (v)  protect  and  sustain  the \nenvironment. The policy outlines the various elements including the project structure, fiscal \nincentives, and bidding process.  \n22. Institutional Reforms. In line with the policy initiatives, the Government established \nits sovereign fund, Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), which groups the Government \nshareholdings of its 11 companies to promote new projects and private sector participation. \nIn January 2008, the Government established Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC) as a \nholding  company  to  oversee  existing  hydropower  companies  and  stations.  The \namalgamation of the existing corporations enabled DHI and DGPC to have larger assets \nand better financial strength. Both DHI and DGPC are expected to promote new hydropower \nprojects by leveraging and structuring public and private capital through various approaches \nincluding PPPs. Another challenge is to simplify the process of private investment and \nprovide \u201csingle-window\u201d clearances to enhance investor confidence in Bhutan. In July 2008, \nthe Government approved DOE to become the Energy Secretariat as the apex agency for \naccelerating hydropower projects and ensuring good governance through an impartial and \nbalanced investment framework, and use of competitive practices under the Hydropower \nDevelopment Policy. These new roles will require strengthening of institutional capacities \nwithin these organizations. \n23. Demonstration Projects for PPP and Clean Development Mechanism. The first \nfew private investment projects coming to Bhutan will be watched and scrutinized by the \ninvestor community. Therefore, it is critical for Bhutan to demonstrate its ability to attract and \nmanage private investments. A pilot hydropower project structured through PPP will evince \ninterest  and  competition  from  private  developers.  Financial  structuring  on  commercial \nprinciples is expected to achieve more credibility and provide more confidence to potential \nforeign public and private investors and lenders. To increase the comparative advantage of \nBhutan\u2019s  hydropower  sector  in  the  regional  power  trading  market,  some  power  export \nprojects will need to be promoted on commercial principles, unlike past projects where tariffs \nhave been politically negotiated with bilateral assistance.13 Any off-take prices set in a \ncommercial manner will make significant impacts on subsequent project development and \ninvestment. Additional benefits from sales of carbon emission reductions are expected to \nattract private capital once power export substantiates cross-border Clean Development \nMechanism (CDM) opportunities.\n24. Regulatory Systems. The regulator, BEA, is regulating only two government-owned \npublic entities: BPC and DGPC. It will be required to take proactive initiatives to frame \nstandards and codes to regulate the activities of hydropower development and companies, \nincluding private players. Presently, BEA is run by a commission that is functionally and \nfinancially autonomous.14 While BEA remains within DOE managerially, the Government \nrecognizes that the current structure will no longer be appropriate if the private sector \n                                                          \n13No specific tariff regulations are in place for cross-border power trading between Bhutan and India. The \nexisting three power plants for export have export tariffs ranging from Rs1.8 to Rs2.0. \n14One of commissioners was recently appointed to represent the private sector.", "7\nbecomes  involved  in  hydropower  generation.  The  Government  is  targeting  a  complete \nseparation of BEA from DOE in 2009 to prepare for private sector involvement.15\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n25.  The impact of the Project is to sustain the country\u2019s inclusive economic growth in \npromoting cross-border power trade and electricity access. As an outcome, the coverage of \npower distribution will be improved, and the export of power expanded through clean power \ndevelopment  in  a  sustainable  manner.  It  will  generate  a  long-term  revenue  stream  for \nBhutan to finance its enormous development needs for social infrastructure such as health \nand education, as well as economic infrastructure facilities like roads and electricity supplies. \nThey will form the very basis of rural development and poverty reduction in the country. \nInvestment for rural electrification will improve access to electricity for rural households and \nsmall businesses, and replace more expensive and polluting kerosene and fuelwood with \nrenewable hydropower and solar energy. It will also make social interventions to the poor, \nand improve the standard of living and quality of life of rural residents. The Dagachhu \nhydropower development will generate export revenues that will be used for subsidies to \nmaintain low-cost power supplies to rural electrification, while exporting power to India and \nthus enhancing cross-border cooperation and regional energy efficiency. \nB.  Outputs \n26.  The  Project  will  provide  separate  financing  for  each  of  two  major  physical \ninvestments: (i) regional clean power trade, and (ii) renewable energy access for the poor. \n1.  Loan-Financed Regional Clean Power Trade \n27.   The 114 MW run-of-river Dagachhu hydropower component will generate 500,000 \nmegawatt hours (MWh) of power annually and export to India through the existing grid \nconnected to India. BPC will separately build a 19 km, 220-kilovolt (kV) transmission line to \nevacuate  power  generated  from  the  plant  to  the  grid.  The  project  site  will  be  on  the \nDagachhu river, a tributary stream of the Punatsangchhu (Sankosh), which drains into the \nBrahmaputra river in India. Construction of access roads to the site (with Government \nfinancing) is progressing well and expected to be completed by January 2009.       \n28.   Clean and renewable power export will be counted as carbon saving in the coal-\ndominated Indian power market. Under the CDM as defined in the Kyoto Protocol, the clean \npower generated from the Dagachhu plant will displace power generated by fossil fuel-\nbased thermal power generation in the eastern Indian power grid. The resulting reduction of \ngreenhouse gases equivalent to CO  emissions will be quantified as 500,000 tons every \n2\nyear and 15 million tons over 30 years.         \n                                                          \n15ADB and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) supported BEA in establishing a \nregulatory framework. NORAD has committed to provide continuous technical support to BEA capacity \nbuilding.  ", "8\n2.  Grant-Financed Renewable Energy Access for the Poor \n29.   The rural electrification component will extend the distribution system to provide \nclean and reliable power supply to rural households mainly in seven districts of Bhutan.16\nThe Rural Electrification Master Plan aims for rural electrification of about 25,000 more rural \nhouseholds during the 10th FYP. In May 2007, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation \nprovided a loan to support rural electrification of 15,322 households in 10 districts. ADB\u2019s \nfinancing will be provided in parallel to cover the balance of the target, including more \nremote central and eastern regions. Based on a physical route survey for each of seven \nsubprojects, ADB will help electrify 8,767 consumers including households, facilities, and \nindustries.\n30.   In addition to grid extension, 119 solar photovoltaic systems will be installed to \nsupport off-grid rural electrification in isolated areas, focusing on schools, health clinics, \nmonasteries, and other community facilities to maximize development impact. The solar \nphotovoltaic systems will apply emerging technology of (i) white light-emitting diode for \nlighting,  and  (ii)  capacitors  for  electricity  charging  to  replace  conventional  lamps  and \nbatteries. Compared to conventional types of photovoltaic systems, these products will be \nenergy  efficient  and  environment  friendly  with  much  longer  life  and  lower  electricity \nconsumption. Therefore, they are expected to resolve traditional unsustainable solar energy \nproblems such as unfavorable impacts to the environment from battery disposal, high cost of \nfrequent battery maintenance and replacement, and delivery difficulties for heavy batteries \nto remote areas.\nC.  Special Features  \n31. Public\u2013Private Partnership. The Dagachhu hydropower development will be the \nfirst  undertaking  with  a  commercial  nature,  unlike  projects  promoted  under  bilateral \nassistance.  It  was  developed  through  PPPs  to  leverage  private  capital  and  maximize \nimpacts  of  the  government  investment.  In  June  2008,  DGPC  signed  a  shareholders \nagreement to form a joint venture with equity participation from a private company, Tata \nPower Company (TPC), which has sufficient experience as a private power developer in \nIndia. Accordingly, Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (DHPC) was incorporated as the \nspecial  purpose  company  for  the  development.  The  Government  envisaged  that  the \nDagachhu development would be a pilot case to catalyze private participation through a \nconcessional agreement and accelerate hydropower development in Bhutan. Tata Power \nTrading Company (TPTC) signed a power purchase agreement to supply power generated \nfrom the Dagachhu plant.17 The experience gained by Bhutan in terms of negotiating with \noff-takers for commercial tariffs and developing shareholders agreements with a strategic \npartnership with the private sector will be of significant importance to implementing more \nhydropower  projects  under  the  Hydropower  Development  Policy.  The  Dagachhu \ndevelopment is expected to catalyze and expand investment for clean energy projects in \nBhutan.\n                                                          \n16Target  districts  include  Pemagatshel,  Punakha,  Samdrup  Jongkhar,  Sarpang,  Trashigang,  and \nWangduephodrang. Due to the recent changes of district boundary, part of Dagana and Mongar will also be \nincluded.  \n17The power generated from the Dagachhu plant is expected to be supplied to North Delhi Power through the \ntransmission line owned by Powerlinks Transmission, a private joint venture with TPC and Power Grid \nCorporation of India. ", "9\n32. Regional Cooperation. Presently, cross-border power trading is limited in South \nAsia, where most power exchange is available only between Bhutan and India.18 During the \npast decades, all cross-border power trading projects in South Asia have been supported by \nthe Government of India. The Dagachhu hydropower development will be the first to be \nmainly  promoted  by  the  Government  of  Bhutan  and  assisted  by  banks  and  financial \ninstitutions. Since the cross-border power trading market and participants have been limited, \nTPTC\u2019s private sector participation in the market will create a competitive business climate \nin regional power trading in South Asia.19 The PPP modality will enhance the investment \nenvironment for developing clean hydropower potential in the region through private capital. \n33. Clean Development Mechanism. The Dagachhu hydropower development posted \nits application to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change website for \npublic  comments  in  2007.  A  validation  report  is  being  prepared  and  DHPC  will  seek \nregistration with the CDM Board. The Indian electricity grid based on mainly coal-fired power \nplants has been treated as the baseline against which greenhouse gas emission reductions \nof the Dagachhu hydropower development  are measured. Thus, the Government expects \nthe Dagachhu hydropower development to be a showcase cross-border CDM project. The \ngovernments of Bhutan and India have already approved it as a CDM project. Since TPTC \nhas in principle agreed to underwrite the purchase of the emission reductions over 30 years \nat a specific minimum price, irrespective of whether a post 2012 agreement is reached,20\nDHPC expects to have an assured revenue from carbon emission reductions over the \nduration of its operations.  \n34. Energy  Efficient  Design  and  Technology.  The  Project  focuses  on  energy \nefficiency and environment-friendly technology. The generation system for the Dagachhu \nplant will use pelton turbines, which can be operated in an environment-friendly manner with \nsmall discharges of river water. The rural electrification will apply the single-phase system \nwhere  the  cost  is  lower,  electricity  supply  is  more  efficient,  and  the  delivery  is  easier \nbecause of its smaller transformer size.21 The off-grid rural electrification component will \napply for emerging technology of white light-emitting diode and capacitors considered to be \nmore  environment-friendly  and  sustainable.22 The  technology  transfer  will  need  to  be \ndemonstrated in terms of design, procurement, and performance before replicating and \nimplementing further applications. \nD.  ADF IX Grant, Hard-term ADF, and Ordinary Capital Resources  \n35. ADF  IX  Grant  Financing.  In 2007, ADB decided to align with the International \nDevelopment Association 14 framework, to define eligibility for grants to Asian Development \nFund (ADF)-only countries. Under the revised ADF grants framework, Bhutan is classified as \neligible for 100% grants until the ADF IX replenishment period ends in 2008. ADF grants aim \nto  provide  development  assistance  to  help  a  country  tackle  development  issues  in  an \n                                                          \n18The power exchange between India and Nepal is presently only at 50 MW. Since Nepal has an acute power \nshortage, excess power from Nepal has been limited.   \n19The best off-take price of TPTC was selected on a competitive basis. \n20DHPC and TPTC signed a term sheet in August 2008. \n21Most rural electrification in Bhutan was designed with a costly three-phase system. This would make the \nmaterial head loading transportation more difficult and its associate costs higher since the target project sites \nextended for rural electrification were remote with difficult terrain away from the existing grid system. \n22The lifetime of a white light-emitting diode is more than 20 years compared to 1 year for conventional compact \nfluorescent  lamps;  capacitors  have  guarantees  at  least  for  10  years  (no  lifetime  theoretically),  while \nconventional  chemical  batteries  have  a  short  lifetime  (usually  3  years)  and  regular  replacement  and \nmaintenance is required at the expense of consumers. ", "10\nenvironment of debt vulnerability, and assist the country in developing the private sector and \nachieving sustainable economic development.23 The ADF grant is allocated for the rural \nelectrification component.  \n36. Hard-Term ADF and Ordinary Capital Resources Financing. While ADF grant-\neligible  countries  will  generally  be  restricted  from  public  or  public-guaranteed  ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) borrowing until their debt indicators improve, an exception to this \nrestriction is given in individual cases for high-revenue-earning projects that generate more \nnet foreign exchange than the foreign debt service requirement. This is consistent with the \napproach of the ADB graduation policy for OCR borrowing by ADF countries. In accordance \nwith the graduation policy and the revised ADF grant framework, nonconcessional term \nlending (i.e., OCR), hard-term ADF lending, and/or guarantees can be considered on an \nexceptional basis for Bhutan for the Dagachhu hydropower development as it will be earning \nforeign exchange and will be able to fully service foreign debt from net foreign exchange \nearnings (para. 61).24\n37. Debt  Sustainability.  Bhutan\u2019s public debt to GDP ratio  peaked in 2006 mainly \nbecause of borrowings for the Tala hydropower plant and the purchase of aircraft for the \nstate-owned Druk Air. It declined in 2007 and will continue to drop if no new large projects \nare  accommodated.  Even  with  new  projects,  such  as  the  Dagachhu  hydropower \ndevelopment, the ratio will rise again until 2011 in the short term; it is expected to drop \ncontinuously afterward. The PPTA conducted Bhutan\u2019s debt sustainability analysis based on \nthe debt sustainability framework for low-income countries as defined by the International \nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)  and  the  International  Development  Association  (Appendix  4). \nConsequently, the cumulative effects arising from the new development\u2019s benefits after \n2011 will result in a considerable reduction of debt burden with a higher pace. This indicates \nthat  the  Government\u2019s  debt  burden  arising  from  new  projects  including  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower development will be more than offset by the reduction in debt burden indicators \nresulting from increases in exports, GDP, and fiscal revenues. The Dagachhu hydropower \ndevelopment will thus help ensure the country\u2019s debt position is sustainable. The IMF\u2019s 2007 \nArticle IV Consultation on Bhutan clarifies that Bhutan\u2019s experience in implementing and \noperating  hydropower  projects  is  one  of  the  biggest  mitigation  factors  in  substantially \nimproving the debt dynamics. Consequently, IMF suggests that Bhutan's risk of external \ndebt  distress  be  upgraded,  reflecting  the  authorities'  good  record  of  implementation  of \nexternally  financed  hydroelectric  projects,  high  overall  foreign  exchange  reserves,  and \nstrong external development partner support for power sector projects.25\nE.  Project Investment Plan  \n38.  The project investment cost is estimated at $234.45 million including all relevant \ncosts (Table 1 and Appendix 5). The Dagachhu hydropower component is estimated to cost \n$201.47  million  including  contingencies  and  financing  charges.  The  rural  electrification \ncomponent is estimated to cost $32.98 million, including contingencies, which comprise the \non-grid component of $31.92 million, and the off-grid component of $1.06 million.  \n                                                          \n23ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila. \n24ADB Operations Manual, Section A1/BP, para.10 and A3/BP, para.19. \n25The IMF Article IV Consultation was issued in October 2007 and concludes that Bhutan\u2019s risk of external debt \ndistress is upgraded to \u201cmoderate.\u201d ADB follows the debt-distress classification of the International Monetary \nFund and International Development Association, which has a cutoff date of 31 December 2006, to determine \nfuture grant eligibility.

Dagachhu Hydropower. The Government has requested a loan of $51,000,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s OCR to help finance the Dagachhu hydropower component. The OCR loan will \nhave a 30-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility, \ncommitment charges of 0.15% per annum during the disbursement period, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication \nor advice from ADB. \n41.  The  Government  also  requested  a  loan  of  $29,000,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The hard-term ADF loan will have an interest charge at the rate of \n3.15% per annum; a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements. 26\n42.  The Dagachhu hydropower component will cost $201.46 million including debt of \n$121.5 million (60%) and equity of $80.0 million (40%). ADB will finance $80 million as \nanchor money to take a lead in the financial structuring. The Kingdom of Bhutan will be the \nborrower of ADB loans from OCR and hard-term ADF. Of the $80 million, ADB will provide \n(i) $51 million (OCR) to DHPC as the debt portion of the Dagachhu development, and (ii) \n$29  million  (hard-term  ADF)  to  DGPC  as  the  equity  portion  through  lending  to  the \nGovernment.  For  the  total  equity  requirement  of  $80  million,  Bhutan\u2019s  public  sector, \nincluding the Government, DGPC, and National Pension and Provident Fund (NPPF), will \ncontribute $59 million (including the $29 million from the hard-term ADF loan); Tata Power \nCompany will participate as a minority shareholder with equity of $21 million. The debt \nbalance is expected to be cofinanced by the Austrian export credit agency, OeKB ($55.5 \nmillion) and NPPF ($15 million). The detailed financial structure and fund flow proposed is \nprovided in Appendix 6. \n43.  The Government will relend the ADB loans to DGPC and DHPC through subsidiary \nloan agreements with the same terms and conditions as the ADB loans. Foreign exchange \nrisks  will  be  assumed  by  the  corresponding  entities.  The  Government\u2019s  equity  will  be \nprovided to DGPC, which will become the majority shareholder (59% of the total share) of \nDHPC. The balance of DHPC\u2019s shares will be held by minority shareholders: TPC (26%) \nand  NPPF  (15%).  An  Indian  commercial  bank  is  expected  to  help  hedge  the  foreign \ncurrency  loan(s)  through  currency  swap  arrangements  or  any  alternative  proposals  to \nminimize  the  currency  mismatching  risk  between  the  project\u2019s  revenue  and  debt.  The \ncurrency risk analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix J.\n                                                          \n26The hard-term ADF loan is more concessional than OCR. The blended use of the hard-term ADF is based on \nInternational Monetary Fund guidance that low-income countries (as defined by the fund) should exhaust all \navenues  of  access  to  concessional  resources  before  considering  nonconcessional  borrowing,  and  that \nborrowing on nonconcessional terms may be justified with high expected rates of return.  ", "13\n44. Rural Electrification. ADB will provide a grant of $25,280,000 equivalent to help \nfinance the on-grid component of the rural electrification. The financing will be provided from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The Government will finance the local currency component \nfor civil works by providing $6,640,000 equivalent. The Government will relend the grant \nproceeds to BPC with no interest charge. For the off-grid component, the Asian Clean \nEnergy  Fund,  administered  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  is \nexpected to provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $1,000,000, subject to approval by the \nGovernment of Japan.27\nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n45. Dagachhu  Hydropower. DGPC will be the Executing Agency and have overall \nresponsibility for the component. DHPC will be the Implementing Agency with responsibility \nfor day-to-day coordination, implementation, and administration. DHPC is a special purpose \ncompany  that  has  the  capacity  to  undertake  all  activities  required  for  successful \nimplementation, including (i) procurement of goods and works; (ii) construction supervision; \n(iii)  maintenance  of  separate  project  accounts;  (iv)  monitoring  and  reporting  of  project \nimplementation; and (v) provision of supervision, coordination, support, and liaison activities \nas required.  \n46. Rural  Electrification.  DOE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  BPC  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency for grid-extended rural electrification and DOE\u2019s Renewable Energy \nDivision will be the Implementing Agency for off-grid electrification. BPC has executed the \npast three ADB-financed rural electrification projects and demonstrated good performance \nfor project management. BPC has established a project implementation unit and assigned \nthe project manager and staff. Under BPC\u2019s supervision, local private contractors will carry \nout the majority of construction works.28 The project implementation unit will coordinate with \ncontractors,  district  offices,  and  relevant  government  departments,  in  particular  the \nDepartment of Roads.  \n2.  Implementation Period  \n47.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years to 31 December 2013. The Dagachhu \nhydropower component has already started developing site infrastructure for access roads, \nwater, and electricity facilities. Construction for the rural electrification component will be \ncompleted in a phased manner for each of seven subprojects. The implementation and \nproject readiness schedules are in Appendix 7. \n3.  Procurement \n48.   The  Dagachhu  hydropower  component  has  two  contract  packages  through  the \nengineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  scheme:  one  for  civil  works  to  be \nfinanced by ADB and one for electromechanical works to be financed by the Austrian Export \nCredit Agency, OeKB. The civil works will be procured by using international competitive \n                                                          \n27Asian Clean Energy Fund (ACEF) was established by the Government of Japan. If the Government of Japan \ndoes not approve the financing from ACEF, either (i) alternative financing will be obtained, or (ii) the off-grid \ncomponent will not form part of the Project. \n28This approach of outsourcing construction work to local private contractors is based on experience gained \nduring ADB\u2019s previous rural electrification projects, which proved very successful. ", "14\nbidding procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time), and the electromechanical works will be procured in accordance with \nOeKB requirements.29 For the rural electrification component, the ADB grant will mainly be \nused for the hard costs of material procurement using international competitive bidding. All \nconstruction  works  and  material  transportation  are  to  be  outsourced  through  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. 30  DHPC  and  BPC  will  include \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  and  costs  identified  in  environmental  assessments \napproved for each component in civil work contracts to comply with Bhutanese and ADB \nenvironment requirements. The procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n4.  Advanced Contracting \n49.  To expedite implementation, the Government, DHPC, DGPC, and BPC asked ADB \nto approve advance actions for procurement of works, goods, and services. ADB granted \napproval of advanced contracting on 1 July 2008. DHPC floated a tender for civil works on \n15 July 2008, and electromechanical works on 1 August 2008. BPC will begin this process \nwithin 2008.  \n5.  Consulting Services \n50.   ADB assessed BPC\u2019s capacity to implement the rural electrification component and \ndetermined that consulting services are not required. Off-grid rural electrification packages \nwill include small-scale consultant services to support DOE in implementing procurement \nand installing solar panels. Consultants for this component will be selected and engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and individual experts will be recruited based on biodata submitted in specific terms \nof reference for assignments. To support the Dagachhu hydropower component in preparing \nbidding documents and conducting bidding, bid evaluation, and negotiations for civil works \nand electromechanical contracts, the Austrian Government also provided DHPC with TA for \nconsulting services. The Austrian Government has committed to provide subsequent TA to \nsupport construction and supervision work during construction. \n6.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation \n51.   All relevant stakeholders, including affected communities and affected people, were \nfully  consulted  during  project  preparation.31 Development  of  the  Dagachhu  hydropower \ncomponent considered affected peoples\u2019 concerns and preferences during finalization of the \ndesign,  particularly  the  alignment  of  access  roads  to  minimize  negative  impacts,  while \nmaximizing benefits. They were consulted to define appropriate compensation rates and a \ncourse of actions including scheduling, and were requested to select cash compensation or \nthe alternative land to be awarded as replacement for the land acquired by the Dagachhu \nfacility. Public consultation with all stakeholders will continue throughout implementation of \nthe Dagachhu hydropower component. \n                                                          \n29To coordinate these two procurement processes, the bidding documents for both packages were prepared \nbased on ADB\u2019s Standard Bidding Documents for Plant and FIDIC Conditions of Contract for EPC/Turnkey \nProjects.\n30The national competitive bidding procedure is applied as (i) the contract values are small, (ii) works are \nscattered across the country, and (iii) works are labor intensive. \n31The consultation included the awareness and prevention campaign for HIV/AIDS during construction in spite of \na small infection rate in Bhutan. ", "15\n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n52.  Disbursement  procedures  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nby the Government and ADB. Since the disbursements under the Dagachhu hydropower \ncomponent  will  mainly  be  for  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services,  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment letter, reimbursement, and direct payment procedures will be utilized.32 The \nhard-term ADF loan will be disbursed through the Government to DGPC for its equity \ncontribution.  The  rural  electrification  component  will  also  use  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures to liquidate advances for each payment not exceeding $100,000. Under these \nprocedures, ADB will advance 6 months of estimated expenditures, or 10% of the grant \namount,  whichever  is  lower,  to  the  imprest  account,  and  the  Government  will  use  the \naccount to pay eligible expenditures.  \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n53.  The accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the project loans \nand  grants  will  be  established  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  and  practices \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  maintain  separate \naccounts for the components. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, they will \nsubmit to ADB (i) annual project accounts, with detailed descriptions of the sources of \nreceipts  and  expenditures;  and  (ii)  annual  financial  statements  comprising  an  income \nstatement,  balance  sheet,  statement  of  cash  flow,  and  related  notes  to  the  financial \nstatements and consolidated for all operations. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB will \n(i) audit the project accounts and financial statements, (ii) provide an opinion on the ADB-\nfinanced imprest fund and statement of expenditures, and (iii) confirm compliance with \nADB\u2019s financial covenants, in conformity with the definitions contained in the loan, grant, and \nproject agreements. \n9.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance \n54.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the Government, DGPC, DHPC, and BPC. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of the Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the loan and grant regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the loan and grant \nprojects  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords and accounts of the executing and implementing agencies and all contractors, \nsuppliers, and other service providers as they relate to Project.  \n55.  DHPC will operate within a corporate and power sector governance framework. \nThrough the PPP structure of the Dagachhu hydropower component, DHPC has public and \nprivate shareholder representatives on its board of directors. The shareholders agreement \ndefines  board  composition,  transparent  financial  reporting  and  auditing,  professional \nmanagement  of  the  company  at  an  arms-length  basis  from  shareholders,  and  full \ntransparency  of  day-to-day  administration.  The  Government  ensures  that  the  corporate \ngovernance procedures in the Companies Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan will supplement the \n                                                          \n32The Dagachhu hydropower component will not require an imprest fund.

Project Performance Management System \n56.  Each of the executing and implementing agencies will prepare progress reports for \nits respective component and submit these to ADB on a quarterly basis within 30 days from \nthe end of each quarter. Each report will provide (i) a narrative description of progress made \nduring the period, (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems or difficulties \nencountered, (iv) work to be carried out in the next period, and (v) progress on social and \nenvironmental compliance. The progress report will include a summary financial account for \nthe project loan and grant components, consisting of project expenditures for the year to \ndate and total expenditure to date, and a contract financing plan. In particular, DHPC and \nBPC will submit a consolidated report that integrates the Dagachhu development with its \nassociated transmission component financed by BPC. Performance will be evaluated based \non  indicators  and  targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  BPC  will \nidentify  and  maintain  profiles  of  new  customers  connected  by  the  rural  electrification \ncomponent as baseline data for the postproject analysis. DHPC will monitor the baseline \ninformation as per the resettlement plan (para. 69) and the environmental management plan \n(EMP) (paras. 74 and 75).  \n57.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of project approval to prepare the \nproject administration memorandum. ADB will review the implementation and operation of \nthe  investment  project  based  on  the  quarterly  progress  reports  and  meet  with  the \nGovernment, and executing and implementing agencies semiannually to discuss progress of \nindividual  subprojects  and  any  changes  to  implementation  arrangements  or  remedial \nmeasures required to achieve the project objectives. A midterm review will be carried out ", "17\nduring the third year of project implementation, and a project completion report will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 3 months following completion of the individual component.   \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n58.  A capacity development technical assistance (CDTA) will be attached to the Project. \nThe Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund33 will provide a grant of $888,000 and the \nADB TA funding program will provide $600,000, for a total of $1,488,000. The CDTA for \nPromotion of Clean Power Export Development aims to (i) develop capacity (e.g., risk \nmanagement and project structuring function, and private participation promotion) for DOE, \nDGPC, and DHI; (ii) provide a financial structuring study for medium-size power export \nprojects,34 and (iii) prepare project design document(s) for accessing CDM funding sources. \nThe CDTA will also support DOE in promoting investment solicitation, due diligence, and \nfinancing plans for the demonstration projects. The Government asked ADB for advance \ncontracting to facilitate CDTA implementation. The proposed CDTA scope is presented in \nAppendix 9.\nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial Justification \n59. Financial Viability and Sustainability. The financial analysis for each of the two \nproject  components:  Dagachhu  hydropower  and  rural  electrification  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005). All financial \ncosts and benefits are expressed in constant 2008 prices. To determine the financial internal \nrate  of  return  (FIRR),  cost  streams  such  as  capital  investment,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance reflect costs of delivering the estimated benefits. Revenue streams are based \non the tariff for sale of energy generated by each of the components. The weighted average \ncost of capital was calculated and compared with the project FIRRs to ascertain the financial \nviability of each project component. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the \nunderlying assumptions was also assessed.  \n60.  The FIRR after taxes is 10.44% for the Dagachhu hydropower component. The FIRR \ncompares favorably with the estimated value of weighted average cost of capital at 5.63%, \nsubstantiating  the  component\u2019s  financial  viability.  However,  the  rural  electrification \ncomponent  will  not  be  financially  viable  without  any  capital  or  operating  subsidies.  A \nsummary of the project financial analysis is presented in Appendix 10. \n61.  DHPC\u2019s  debt  to  equity  ratio  is  60  to  40.  Its  projected  financial  performance  is \nexpected to maintain adequate debt service coverage ratios, with the minimum of 1.5 times \nand average of 2.2 times. This clearly indicates that the Dagachhu hydropower development \nwill generate cash surplus to fully service debt obligations. The profitability is represented by \nan internal rate of return on equity of 15.6% on a before-tax basis and 12.0% on an after-tax \nbasis.35 These results demonstrate that the Dagachhu development is bankable. DHPC is \nexpected to contribute to Government revenue through taxes, dividends, and royalties. The \nmajor sponsor of DHPC is DGPC, which also contributes to the financial robustness. The \n                                                          \n33Established under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility. \n34The sample projects will include the Nikachhu (210 MW) and Khomachhu hydropower (326 MW) projects. \n35The return was calculated after deducting the royalty revenue to the Government. The provision for the energy \nroyalty is that a minimum of 12% of the electricity generated for the first 12 years and 18% for the balance of \n18 years will be made available at no charge to the Government. ", "18\nopening financial position for DGPC as of 1 January 2008 is based on the accounts of three \nsubsidiary hydropower companies including Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation, Basochhu \nHydro Power Corporation, and Kurichhu Hydro Power Corporation. DGPC\u2019s profitability is \nvery high, with 29% return of net fixed assets primarily due to Chhukha Hydro Power \nCorporation, which is a debt-free hydropower company. Overall DGPC\u2019s return of net fixed \nassets  is  likely  to  increase  and  contribute  to  Bhutan\u2019s  economy  as  it  merges  Tala \nHydroelectric Project Authority36 and promotes more hydropower development projects.  \n62.  BPC substantially improved its profitability in 2006 through a combination of tariff \nincreases  and  improved  operating  efficiency  after  making  losses  since  2002.  Tariff \nincreases were implemented in a timely manner and BPC introduced a performance-based \nincentive  scheme  for  all  operations  staff  in  2006.37 These  initiatives  enabled  BPC  to \ngenerate net profits and resulted in a 4.9% return on net fixed assets as of 31 December \n2007. The transmission wheeling revenues from the Tala plant will enable it to improve its \nprofitability. BPC\u2019s debt service coverage and self-financing ratios have been maintained \nwell above the previous loan covenant\u2019s targets of 1.5 times and 20%, respectively. It has \nalso  maintained  its  overall  system  loss  at  9%\u201310%.  However,  BPC\u2019s  future  financial \nperformance will be influenced by the very high proportion of rural electrification within its \nnetwork and the need to work within tariff policies that incorporate high cross-subsidization. \nThe financial performance and management is summarized in Appendix 11. \n63. Financial  Management.  Financial  management  assessment  was  undertaken  to \ndetermine  the  current  ability  of  DHPC,  DGPC,  and  BPC  to  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary \nrequirements; and identify areas for improvement. The assessment was in accordance with \nADB  guidelines  using  the  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  and  field \ninterviews.\n64.  DHPC was formed as an authority in April 2007 and incorporated in May 2008. As \nthe project company is in its inception stage, its financial accounting is relatively simple, and \nis used by one of the other hydropower companies under DGPC. DHPC presently uses \nspreadsheet-based  software  for  accounting  purposes.  The  PPTA  supported  DGPC\u2019s \nintegration of the accounting system among its subsidiaries and DGPC plans to install the \naccounting  software  in  its  own  offices  and  each  of  its  subsidiaries  to  record  financial \ntransactions in a common format. Then, DHPC is expected to strengthen its accounting \nmanagement and move from manual accounting procedures to an integrated computerized \nfinancial management and accounting system. The joint venture project sponsors, DGPC \nand TPC, agreed to have the seconded or professional financial staff from TPC assist DHPC \nin conducting its financial management. DHPC and DGPC have no prior experience with \nmanaging foreign currency debt and will require capacity building for foreign exchange \nmitigation, fund raising, and concomitant risk management. This will be supported by a new \nCDTA (para. 58).  \n                                                          \n36 The Tala Hydroelectric Project Authority will become a corporation after finalizing its 2008 accounts, and be \namalgamated into DGPC at a later date. \n37The performance-based incentive scheme gave all staff an opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 25% of their \nbasic annual salary, depending on the extent to which the corporation and its component department and \ndivisions  met  objectively  measurable  performance  targets.  This  scheme  has  resulted  in  a  significant \nimprovement in BPC\u2019s operating efficiency. ", "19\n65.  BPC has 53 accounting units within 29 branch offices; all the units are computerized. \nBPC developed procedures and guidelines for this reporting under ADB TA.38 BPC has well-\ndefined  charts  of  accounts  for  recording  financial  transactions.  It  now  plans  to  raise \ncommercial financing from local banks to construct a transmission line to evacuate power \ngenerated from DHPC. In the future, it may need to raise commercial financing outside \nBhutan for some of its investment requirements. Then, BPC will need to develop capacity \nbuilding for raising and managing external funds.  \nB.  Economic Justification \n66.  Economic  analysis  for  each  of  the  two  project  components  was  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. A summary of the \nproject economic analysis is presented in Appendix 12. \n67.  The economic analysis shows that the Dagachhu hydropower component, inclusive \nof the transmission link, has an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.8%, \nwhich is above the ADB traditional threshold. In addition to the normal revenue stream from \nexport of generated power to India, the Dagachhu hydropower component is expected to \ngenerate additional revenue from emission reductions under CDM. In addition it supplies \npower to address India\u2019s energy deficit, in particular to its northern region. Therefore, the \noverall benefits to the Bhutan\u2013India subregion will be significantly higher than the estimated \nEIRR, considering that it will eventually supply unserved demand in the subregion. As a \nresult, the EIRR for the subregion is estimated to be 22.0%.  \n68.  The  economic  benefits  and  costs  were  quantified  with  and  without  the  rural \nelectrification  component.  Each  of  the  component\u2019s  subprojects  exhibits  EIRR  values \nranging from 13% to 26%. The overall component is estimated to have an EIRR of 20%.  \nC.  Social and Poverty Assessment \n69. Social  Aspects.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  and  the \nsummary  resettlement  plan  are  in  Appendix  13  and  Appendix  14  respectively.  No \nindigenous peoples will be affected. No resettlement of houses is required for either of the \ntwo project components. The land acquisition for the Dagachhu hydropower component will \nbe mainly necessary due to the construction of access roads, not covered by ADB financing. \nA total of 25 households will be affected by losing part of their land. Each of the affected \nhouseholds and communities was given the opportunity to choose between cash or land-for-\nland compensation. Through the public consultation, they have selected alternative plots of \nland. In addition to the land plots, DHPC is providing compensation for affected crops. Due \nto the lack of recent market rates for trees and crops, DHPC agreed to top-up the amounts \nalready compensated with additional funds at the end of the cropping season. Affected \npeople agreed to this two-stage compensation approach that will ensure compensation at \nmarket value for crops and trees. To guide the land acquisition and compensation, a short \nresettlement plan was disclosed to all those affected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary\nResettlement Policy (1995) and the relevant laws and policies of the Government.  \n70.  No  negative  social  impacts  are  anticipated  during  implementation  of  the  rural \nelectrification component. No land acquisition will be required and no damage to crops and \n                                                          \n38ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  Capacity  Building  of  Bhutan  Power \nCorporation. Manila.  ", "20\nprivate trees is expected as distribution lines and poles can be designed and aligned to \navoid any disruptions. No resettlement plan is therefore included, although an in-depth \nsurvey was carried out under the PPTA to assess poverty impacts. Access to electricity will \nmake positive social impacts on health, in particular for women who are more active at \nhousework such as cooking. \n71. Poverty Aspects. The poverty impact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix G. \nRural  electrification  schemes  have  proved  beneficial  for  poverty  reduction  and  income \ngeneration. As rural areas usually fall behind in access to both social services and income \nopportunities, the grid expansion along with development of other infrastructure such as \nroads and public utilities will boost the local economy and provide additional health-related \nbenefits. Access to electricity is also expected to improve education by allowing children to \ndevote  longer  hours  to  studying,  and  schools  to  avail  of  additional  facilities  such  as \ncomputers. Income generation activities and increased productivity are among the major \npositive impacts of rural electrification schemes. Income security through its diversification is \nalso a fundamental benefit, as it reduces vulnerability. According to the results from the in-\ndepth survey of project beneficiaries, affordability is not expected to be an issue since their \nreal capacity to pay is greater than the expected demand measured by their willingness to \npay.  As  a  result,  the  poverty  impact  ratio  of  the  rural  electrification  subproject  is  an \noutstanding 62%. \n72.  The Dagachhu hydropower component will have direct and indirect positive impacts \non poverty. The local economy has already started developing as some of the civil works \nhave been implemented. The development of access roads to the project site will improve \naccessibility of local communities to main roads. This is expected to stimulate the local \neconomy, while improving quality of life. The Dagachhu development will indirectly support \nrural domestic customers, in particular under a lifeline tariff. The tariff policy requires the \nGovernment to subsidize electricity for lifeline consumers, using 12%\u201318% of the royalty \nrevenue yielded from power export from the Dagachhu plant. Because alternative sources of \nenergy, in particular kerosene, have become progressively more expensive, use of cheaper \nelectricity will increase savings. Power exports will increase the Government\u2019s revenue base \nand  enable  the  Government  to  make  more  resources  available  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment including health, education, and rural electrification. In 2006/07, revenues from \npower exports contributed to all the expenditures for agriculture and social sectors (e.g., \nhealth and education). During the next FYP, the Government considers that revenues from \nhydropower development will be the major source for directly improving quality of life and \nreducing poverty. Incremental income from power exports will be used for improving and \nexpanding  road  and  bridge  infrastructure  to  promote  rural  development  for  poverty \nreduction.\nD.  Environmental Assessment \n73.  ADB classifies the Project as environment category B. In accordance with ADB\u2019s\nEnvironment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), a summary \nIEE (SIEE) was prepared, and reviewed by ADB, to provide a sound basis for project \nprocessing  and  implementation  (Appendix  15  and  Supplementary  Appendix  H).  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental due diligence covers all project-associated facilities including access roads \nand a transmission line from the Dagachhu plant.  \n74.  In accordance with the national legislation, an environmental impact assessment was \ncompleted  for  the  Dagachhu  component  in  July  2006,  and  the  National  Environment ", "21\nCommission granted the environmental clearance in June 2007. The Dagachhu component \nuses  a  run-of-river  design  and  does  not  encroach  on  any  protected  areas.  Mitigation \nmeasures included in the EMP are designed to assure the avoidance of any damage to the \nlocal  environment  or  communities,  or  disturbance  of  important  habitats.  No  human \nsettlement relocation is required for project implementation. Some impacts will occur due to \nconstruction of an access road, but the road does not cross any protected areas or disturb \nlocal habitats in the 51 hectares of broadleaf and conifer forest and scrub for the whole \ndevelopment area. This is a small amount in relation to the very large areas of similar habitat \npresent nearby. Impacts on biodiversity will be minimal.39\n75.  The National Environment Commission and Department of Forests provided national \nenvironmental and forestry clearances for the rural electrification component, and initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) were issued for each district of the project area. While \nconstruction  of  the  distribution  infrastructure  is  not  expected  to  have  major  adverse \nimpacts,40 some negative environmental impacts will occur as most of the villages targeted \nfor electrification are located in forested areas. These impacts will be mitigated through the \nEMP, which requires a set of measures including the reduction of clearance areas for the \nrights-of-way,  installation  of  covered  conductors  in  areas  close  to  protected  areas  and \nsensitive habitats, and alignment of distribution lines along public roads (on curbs) that are \nexcluded from the protected status according to the Road Act of Bhutan 2004. In addition, \nall civil works will be performed by manual labor, and cutting of trees will be monitored by \nstaff  from  Department  of  Forests  local  offices.  After  implementation,  the  schemes  will \noperate without major negative environmental impacts.41\nE.  Risks and Assumptions \n76. Dagachhu Hydropower. Two external risks relate to off-take and CDM. While the \noff-take tariff was agreed with an Indian private power trader (i.e., TPTC, para. 31) on \ncommercial terms, the regulatory or tariff revision risk is considered minimal as the power \npurchase agreement defines the base-year tariff with 2% constant escalation per annum \nover 25 years. Due to the large power demand\u2013supply gap in India, the small 114 MW \nDagachhu generation capacity is likely to be absorbed in the power trading market. Second, \nthe Dagachhu hydropower development is based on the assumption that additional cash \nflows will be generated from the sale of carbon emission reductions, however, the nature of \na post-2012 CDM framework is as yet unknown. To mitigate the risk of this uncertainty, \nDHPC and TPTC have in principle agreed for the purchase of the emission reductions to be \nunderwritten by TPTC over the 30 year duration at a specific minimum price. Therefore, the \noverall project risk to the financial sustainability due to external factors is deemed minimal. \n                                                          \n39As per the EMP, DHPC will continue to monitor the air, soil, water quality baseline, and aquatic life and \nmigratory fish species to determine the minimum ecological water flow and an optimal design for the civil \nworks.   \n40This is because (i) distribution line routes were chosen to minimize the need for forest clearance; (ii) 30% of \ndistribution lines will be in unforested areas where a right-of-way will not be necessary; (iii) lines will be \nlocated on road curbs, which are not subject to environmental protection status; (iv) all other construction work \nis small in scale and will be conducted by manual labor without the use of heavy vehicles and machinery; (iv) \nmost affected areas outside the villages are uninhabited, and work in villages can be conducted without \ncausing major disruption to residents; and (v) construction work is relatively straightforward and can be \ncompleted in a fairly short time. \n41 Rural electrification schemes normally operate with routine maintenance and only occasional repair; any \nrepairs should be small in scale and infrequent.", "22\n77.  Potential risks for the component include (i) increase in cost of civil works and \nequipment, and (ii) delays in project implementation. The cost and time overrun risks are to \nbe mitigated by contractual warranties in the engineering, procurement, and construction \ncontracts.  Sufficient  physical  and  price  contingencies  have  been  considered  for  any \nincrease in the equipment and civil works costs. The component\u2019s main sponsor, DGPC, \nhas already implemented hydropower projects with various agencies and is operating four \nhydropower plants in Bhutan. DHPC staff have experience executing hydropower projects. \nThis will minimize the risk of cost and time overruns, along with PPP arrangements with \nTPC\u2014a joint venture partner in the component with extensive experience in implementing \nand operating hydropower projects worldwide. TA funded by the Government of Austria will \nsupport  DHPC  in  implementation  and  supervision  during  construction.  The  risk  and \nmitigation analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n78. Rural Electrification. The overarching objective of rural electrification is to reduce \npoverty by promoting local economic development through provision of electricity supply. \nHowever, investment and operations in rural electrification will be not financially viable \nbecause of the rural customer\u2019s low paying capacity, associated risks, and high staffing cost \nfor utility services in remote areas. Therefore, the Government\u2019s financial assistance in the \nform of an up-front capital subsidy is inevitable. Since failure to mobilize the necessary \ncounterpart funds is critical to the component, the Government has assured timely provision \nof counterpart funding. \n79.  Potential risks for the component include (i) increase in cost of construction materials \nand transportation due to higher fuel prices, (ii) delays in construction due to procurement \nand contract awards, and (iii) difficult accessibility due to undeveloped access roads. These \nrisks  are  to  be  mitigated  by  (i)  adequate  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  cost \nestimates  based  on  recent  actual  bid  prices;  (ii)  advance  procurement  action; and  (iii) \nintegration of road development plans in rural electrification programs.  \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n80.

Resettlement  Plan  Disclosure.  If any changes are made to the design of the \nProject that affects the land to be acquired or used for the Project in any way, or if new land \nacquisition and/or involuntary resettlement is required for the Project, the Government, and \nthe executing and implementing agencies will prepare or update the resettlement plan for \nADB review and approval, prior to any land acquisition being initiated and no later than the \naward of civil works, and disclose the resettlement plan to affected people in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s applicable information disclosure requirements. The Government will ensure that \nessential public infrastructure that may be affected under land acquisition and resettlement \nis replaced as appropriate in an expeditious manner in accordance with the resettlement \nplan.\n95. Compensation. The Government, DGPC, and DHPC will ensure that (i) sufficient \nbudgetary resources are made available to cover all compensation and associated costs; (ii) \nall compensation will be paid at the applicable rates for project implementation as per the \nresettlement plan; (iii) rates will be revised by September 2008 to ensure application of the \nactual market price, and the entitlement matrix in the resettlement plan should be used in \ndetermining the suitable compensation; (iv) payments are made in a timely manner, in any \ncase before dispossession and beginning of civil works; (v) all project-affected persons are \ncompensated fairly, such that their living standards are not adversely affected; and (vi) any \nrelocation, resettlement, and compensation of any project-affected persons will be promptly \nand efficiently carried out in accordance with the resettlement plan, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary\nResettlement Policy (1995), such that project-affected persons will at least maintain their \nstandard of living at the same level as before project implementation.

", "30 Appendix 2   \nPOWER SECTOR ASSESSMENT \nA.  Key Challenges Facing Hydropower Development \n1.  Domestic  Financial  Resources.  The  most  critical  challenge  facing  hydropower \ndevelopment in Bhutan is the lack of available domestic financial resources to fund large \ninvestments.  The  country\u2019s  Power  System  Master  Plan  identifies  15  projects  for \nimplementation, and the Government considers more than 10 hydropower projects with \naggregate generation capacity of over 10,000 megawatts (MW) for implementation between \n2008 and 2018 during the 10th and 11th five-year plan periods (Table A2).1 The total \ninvestment  requirement  will  be  more  than  $10  billion.  Such  a  capital  expenditure  is \nsignificant compared to aggregate capital figures for the rest of the country\u2019s economy. In \nBhutan, limited public funds invariably need to be allocated to socioeconomic development \nfor health, education, and rural development. Under the circumstances, the Government will \nneed to develop a domestic capital market and diversify operations in the financial sector to \nraise domestic capital and intermediate with external funds.  \nTable A2: Hydropower Projects Proposed during the 10th and 11th Five-Year Plans \nProject Name  Installed Capacity (MW) Type \nPunatsangchhu-I  1,170  Run-of-river \nPunatsangchhu-II  1,000  Run-of-river \nMangdechu  720  Run-of-river \nChamkachu-I  670  Run-of-river \nKholongchu  485  Run-of-river \nAmochu  500  Run-of-river \nKuri Gobgri  1,800  Reservoir \nSunkosh  4,060  Reservoir \nDagachhu  114  Run-of-river \nChamkachu-II  570  Run-of-river \nKhomachhu  326  Run-of-river \nNikachhu  210  Run-of-river \nMW = megawatt. \nSource(s): Gross National Happiness Commission. 2008. Draft 10th Five Year Plan (2008-2013); and \nDepartment of Energy, 2003, Power System Master Plan  \n2. Fiscal Sustainability. The Government\u2019s investment is dependent on international \naid.  Increasing  debt  burden  from  external  sources  would  raise  the  issue  of  debt \nsustainability, and limit access to financial resources for the country. The capital needs of \nthe power sector vastly exceed the availability of resources from traditional multilateral and \nbilateral agencies, and domestic financial resources. Development finance has become \neven tighter given the declining worldwide trend in availability of concessionary financing for \npower development, and the recognition that scarce public resources are needed to develop \nsocial sectors. In this context, the strategic use of foreign public and private participation and \ninvestment will help accelerate the development of hydropower projects in Bhutan. \n                                                          \n1  A number of large hydropower projects with more than 500 MW are planned for development under the \nbilateral partnership between the governments of Bhutan and India.  ", "Appendix 2    31\n3. Investment  Environment.  Private  and  foreign  direct  investment  is  in  its  early \nphases. Even though the underlying economic performance for hydropower development is \nstrong, its concomitant risks keep private investors away. This is most evident in emerging \nmarkets where the most unexploited hydropower potential exists. In neighboring countries \nsuch as India, private investment in hydropower sector was miniscule until recently. Hence, \none of the challenges for Bhutan is to develop a hydropower development policy that can \nattract private sector participation and create a sustainable and competitive investment \nclimate.\n4. Market  Competition.  The  recent  private  sector investment  in  Indian  power  is \ncreating alternative and competitive generation sources. To solve the large domestic supply \ndeficit, the Government of India has unveiled the concept of large thermal projects: ultra \nmega power projects. Some of these projects have offered tariffs in a competitive range of \n$0.03\u2013$0.05/kilowatt-hour. These attractive tariffs are due to generation being available \nthroughout the year, compared to run-of-river type hydropower projects in Bhutan where \ngeneration capacity is limited during winter months due to lower water flow. To increase the \ncomparative advantage of Bhutan\u2019s hydropower in the regional power trading market, some \npower export projects must be promoted on commercial principles, unlike past projects \n2\nwhere tariffs were politically negotiated on bilateral assistance.  Any off-take prices set on a \ncommercial basis will make significant impacts on subsequent project development and \ninvestment.\n5. Transmission  Networking.  Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) will need to work \nclosely  with  its  Indian transmission  counterpart  to  ensure  transmission  facilities  for  the \nexport  of  electricity.  BPC  is  responsible  for  developing  the  transmission  system  within \nBhutan for the evacuation of electricity from hydropower stations to the Indian border point \nof transfer. To supervise and control efficient operation and maintenance of the national \nsystem, BPC is developing a national load dispatch center, which is expected to contribute \nto improving system reliability, shortening power interruption time, and reducing system \nenergy losses. \nB.  Key Challenges for Rural Electrification \n6. Cost Effectiveness. The average capital expenditure for household electrification \nwas  $1,535  under  the  previous  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  project.3 This  is \nexpected  to  reach  $3,640  per  household  customer  in  the  planned  rural  electrification \ncomponent of the Green Power Development Project. The increased electrification cost is \nmainly due to recent price appreciations of materials and fuels (e.g., steel, copper, and \ngasoline). In spite of a least-cost engineering design, the new rural electrification subproject \nwill be inherently more costly due to more remote and dispersed project areas where the \naverage distribution line length is 50% longer and access roads are further away.4 Any \nfuture rural electrification program will have even higher capital expenditure considering \ntougher and more unapproachable terrain. Achieving 100% electrification is estimated to \ncost about $90 million.5 To improve project implementation efficiency, least-cost design and \n                                                          \n2  No specific tariff regulations are in place for cross-border power trading between Bhutan and India. The \nexisting three power plants for export have export tariffs ranging from Rs1.8 to Rs2.0. \n3  ADB. 2003.

The  Government  set  up  an  off-grid \nelectrification arrangement as an alternate approach in case the economic rates of return for \nthe grid extended options are not feasible. \n7. Sustainability. Rural electrification projects often require operating subsidy inputs to \nensure sustainability. Currently the subsidies for rural electrification are provided through (i) \nthe sale of power from generation companies to BPC at a rate that is less than the cost of \nproduction,6 and (ii) cross-subsidies from the sale of electricity to large industrial customers. \nUnder the Tariff Regulations, the regulator, Bhutan Electricity Authority, intends to effectively \ncap the total subsidy available from the sale of power, and require payment at the full cost of \npower  sales  to  India  for  all  local  consumption  in  excess  of  15%  of  Bhutan\u2019s  current \nhydropower generation capability. This means the subsidy will adequately cover low-voltage \nrural domestic customers below the lifeline tariff,7 with medium- and high-voltage customers \npaying the full cost of supply. Nevertheless, BPC\u2019s expenditures for rural distribution system \noperation  and  maintenance,  combined  with  customer  services  result  in  a  loss-making \nproposition  for  BPC.  It  must  develop  a  participative  approach  where  minor  repairs, \nmaintenance, and billing and collection work will be outsourced to contracted villagers.8\nMaintenance  responsibilities  and  ownership  for  off-grid  batteries  will  be  transferred  to \ntrained village technicians.9\n8. Interregional Transmission Network. The lack of an interregional transmission link \nbetween the western and eastern regions of the country has led to constrained industrial \ngrowth in these regions. Due to limited generation availability in the eastern region, the \nextent of rural electrification has lagged. Hence, the interconnection of the western and \neastern grids in Bhutan will increase the reliability of electricity supply in the eastern region \nand  reduce  dependence  on  import  from  India  during  the  winter  when  generation  from \nKurichhu is insufficient to meet domestic demand. The interconnected grid will also provide \nopportunities for accelerated industrialization in the eastern and central region of the country. \n                                                          \n6  The average production cost of electricity from hydropower generation in Bhutan is Nu1.19/kilowatt-hours \n(kWh). Electricity for local consumption is sold to BPC for Nu0.3/kWh. Electricity is sold to India for Nu2.0/kWh, \nexcept  in  eastern  Bhutan,  where  electricity  from  the  Kurichhu  hydropower  project  is  sold  to  India  for \nNu1.80/kWh.\n7  In 2007, domestic customer consumption was 14.88% of the total BPC consumption. \n8  ADB. 2006.

Bhutan\u2019s power sector has received a major portion of its external assistance from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and governments of Austria, India, Japan, Netherlands, \nand Norway and their bilateral agencies.\n2.  While ADB has supported power sector restructuring, institutional development, and \nrural  electrification  expansion;  bilateral  development  partners  have  supported  building \ngeneration capacity through grants and soft loans. The Government of India funded and \nassisted in constructing three major power stations: Chhukha, Kurichhu, and Tala for export \npurposes.  The  Government  of  Austria  supported  the  development  of  the  Basochu \nhydropower plant for domestic supply, and conducted a feasibility study for the proposed \nDagachhu hydropower development. The governments of Japan and Norway supported \nfeasibility  studies  for  potential  hydropower  sites  and  prepared  the  Rural  Electrification \nMaster Plan and the Power System Master Plan, respectively.

", "34 Appendix 4   \nDEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT \n1.  The Department of Public Accounts of the Ministry of Finance is responsible for \nmanagement of government external borrowings. It has shifted its debt records to a more \nsophisticated  information  system\u2014Commonwealth  Secretariat\u2019s  Debt  Recording  and \nManagement System (CS-DRMS). The system is expected to be actively used for regularly \nmonitoring and analyzing debt. \n2.  Current Debt Situation. Total outstanding debt in Bhutan at the fiscal end of June \n2007 is estimated at Nu34,973 million, resulting in a debt to gross domestic product (GDP) \nratio of 88%, down from a high of 95% in 2005/06 and 91% in 2004/05. The drop in \ndomestic and external borrowing contributed to the decrease in debt burden.  \n3.  A major portion of the Government\u2019s borrowing requirements is met from external \nsources. At the close of fiscal year 2006, domestic borrowing constituted only about 8% of \nboth the sanctioned amount and the total outstanding debt. The Government of India has \nbeen the main source of grant aid and loans, contributing the maximum (53%) of Bhutan \nGovernment\u2019s  total  outstanding  debt.  Convertible  currency  loans  contributed  to  the \nremaining debt (i.e., 39%). Of other sources of borrowing in convertible currency, ADB \ncontributed  the  most,  about  17%  of  the  outstanding  debt  followed  by  the  International \nDevelopment Association (IDA), which contributed about 10%.  \n4.  On similar lines, Indian rupee denominated loans contributed 53%, while special \ndrawing  right  (SDR)  loans  constituted  about  30%  of  total  loans  outstanding.  Euro-\ndenominated loans shared about 9% of the debt. Overall, the Government of India, ADB, \nIDA, and the Government of Austria were the main sources of external borrowing. \n5.  Sector Composition of Government Borrowing. The largest portion (about 60%) \nof Government borrowing has been directed to investments in the rapidly expanding power \nsector.  The  transport  and  communications  sectors  (including  telecommunications) \ncontributed to about 14% of the outstanding debt. Among other sectors, agriculture and \nforestry consumed 7% of borrowing, while education and training, and social infrastructure \nsectors,  each  contributed  5%.  Thus,  the  Government  has  purposefully  used  external \nborrowing for power, transport, and communications. Since the power sector provides a \ncomparative  advantage  to  Bhutan,  while  transport  and  communications  are  necessary \ninvestments  for  economic  growth,  the  Government  has  been  prudent  in  utilizing  its \nborrowing.\nA.  Methodology \n6.  Technical  Justification  and  Selection  Criteria.  One  of  the  important \nconsiderations  for  external  borrowing  for  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  is  its \nimpact on the country\u2019s economy. This assessment essentially entails a comparison of \nbeneficial impacts in terms of additional growth in GDP, exports, and revenues with the \nimpending fiscal stress resulting from additional debt service obligations for the borrowing. \n7.  The  debt  sustainability  analysis  is  in  accordance  with  the  debt  sustainability \nframework of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and IDA for low-income countries. The \nmethodology focuses on five key ratios: (i) net present value (NPV) of external debt to GDP; \n(ii) NPV of external debt to exports, (iii) debt service to exports, (iv) NPV of external debt to \nrevenue, and (v) debt service to revenue. However, the IDA 14 approach argues that ", "Appendix 4    35\nrevenue-based ratios are not reliable indicators of stress because of external debt and \nrecommends three indicators of debt distress: (i) NPV of external debt to GDP, (ii) NPV of \nexternal debt to exports, and (iii) debt service to exports.The following analysis is confined to \nthese three indicators.\n8.  Under the debt sustainability framework, the magnitude of each ratio is compared \nwith respective indicative thresholds defined for the ratio. The thresholds, in turn, depend on \nthe classification of the country as a strong, medium, or weak policy nation. Furthermore, \nindicative thresholds follow a decreasing order as the countries move from a \u201cstrong policy\u201d \nto  \u201cweak  policy\u201d  classification.  Bhutan  is  classified  as  a  \u201cstrong  policy\u201d  nation  and  the \ncorresponding thresholds are used for the analysis. \n9.  To assess the impacts of the Dagachhu hydropower development, a forward-looking \napproach  is  used  to  examine  the  dynamic  behaviour  of  the  key  ratios  under  various \nscenarios. The dynamic analysis considers the impact of future borrowing and is preferable \n1\nover static analysis, which is based on a snapshot of a country\u2019s external debt situation.\n10.  In  assessing  the  debt  distress  of  countries,  the  debt  sustainability  framework \ncategorizes them into three groups: low-, moderate-, and high-risk countries; countries in \nserious  debt  distress  breach  the  thresholds  by  a  significant  margin.  This  classification \ninvolves examining the relative distance of the country from the debt distress threshold \nbased on the three indicators. The debt situation in Bhutan was assessed accordingly.\n11.  Liabilities considered for analysis include the existing budget and off-budget loans, \nloans in the pipeline, and expected additional liabilities because of the fiscal deficit. The \ncomposition of new loans is assumed to follow past trends. \n12.  The impact of the planned borrowing for standby power projects (namely Dagachhu \nand  Punatsangchu-I)  was  analyzed  by  including  these  projects  in  stages  in  different \nscenarios.  In  addition,  the  impact  of  past  power  projects  was  assessed  separately  by \nexcluding debt service obligations and their beneficial impacts on the economy.  \n13.  Further, additional scenarios were examined by excluding all self-sustaining new and \nexisting power projects from the Government liabilities to measure overall impact of the \npower sector on the debt sustainability indicators. This is based on the self-sustainability \nconcept of \u201cenclave\u201d or commercially viable projects. \nB.  Analysis \n14.  The measurement of debt distress involves the thresholds for the three indicators, (i) \nNPV of external debt to GDP\u201450%, (ii) NPV of external debt to exports\u2014200%, and (iii) \ndebt service to exports\u201425%. \n15.  The introduction of the Dagachhu hydropower development results will increase \nBhutan\u2019s external debt by $135 million over 3 years. The analysis shows that the ratios of \nNPV of debt to exports and debt service to exports remain within the thresholds even under \na scenario where 30% local currency depreciation is allowed. The NPV of debt to GDP ratio, \n                                                          \n1  ADB uses the analysis from the 2007 IMF\u2013IDA debt distress classification, which has a cutoff date of 31 \nDecember 2006. Under the analysis, the static approach was used in the absence of the forward-looking \napproach. ", "36   Appendix 4 \nwhich is already above the threshold and rises further when new loans are introduced, soon \nfalls steeply below the threshold. The rate of fall of this indicator is significantly higher than \nin the scenario even when new loans are not considered.  \n16.  Further the analyses show that although some of the key indicators rise in the short \nterm when new projects, Dagachhu and Punatsangchhu-I, are considered, the fall in these \nratios is significantly faster in the medium term than when these project loans are not \nconsidered. Also these indicators rapidly drop below the levels that would be achieved in the \nabsence of these projects. Thus, Bhutan would be at a disadvantage in the long run if the \nnew power project loans are not utilized. \n17.  From a different perspective, since the Tala, Dagachhu, and Punatsangchhu-I power \nprojects are self-sustaining with firm long-term sales contracts; they can be excluded from \nthe debt stock for the purpose of debt-sustainability analysis. With this approach, all three \nratios would remain within the sustainable limit throughout the period.  \n18.  If the calculations exclude the impact of all the existing power projects such as Tala, \nChhukha,  Kurichhu,  and  Basochu,  the  debt  situation  would  become  completely \nunsustainable and all three ratios would be adversely affected. This is because the benefits \nfrom these projects in terms of additional exports, revenues, and GDP growth are significant. \nThis means that although these large power projects may cause additional financial burden \nin the short term, the benefits in the long term far outweigh the debt burden imposed on the \ncountry.\n19.  The financial analysis shows that the Dagachhu hydropower development is self-\nfinancing and sustainable, and is not likely to have any burden on the Government budget. It \ncan  be  supported  given  its  positive  long-term  impact  on  the  economy  and  debt \nsustainability. \n20.  When considering the dynamic sustainability and solvency criteria of declining fiscal \nstress, the overall debt situation in Bhutan appears to be sustainable.  \n21.  In June 2007, based on the prevailing debt situation, the IMF\u2013IDA categorization, \nand available economic data until 2005, ADB classified Bhutan as a high-risk country.2\n22.  Since then IMF\u2013IDA issued its staff report on article IV Consultation in October 2007 \nproviding  a  positive  assessment  of  Bhutan\u2019s  debt  distress.  Though  the  conventional \nindicators and tests point to Bhutan as having a high risk of debt distress, IMF Article IV \nConsultation on Bhutan (October 2007) suggests that mitigation factors such as Bhutan\u2019s \nexperience in implementing and operating hydropower projects, and its relationship and \nwider dialogue with India, and its support to annual budget, have substantially improved the \ndebt dynamics.  Therefore IMF concludes that Bhutan's risk of external debt distress is \nmoderate, reflecting the authorities' good record of implementation of externally financed \nhydroelectric  projects,  high  overall  foreign  exchange  reserves,  and  strong  external \ndevelopment agency support for power projects.

Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Finance.  The cost of the Dagachhu hydropower \ndevelopment  is  estimated  at  $201.5  million  including  all  related  costs  and  contingencies, \nassuming debt of $121.5 million (60%) and equity of $80.0 million (40%). ADB is expected to \nfinance $80 million as the development anchor money to take the lead for financial structuring \nfor both debt and equity. ADB loans will consist of (i) $51 million from the ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) and (ii) $29 million as a hard-term loan from the Asian Development Fund \n(ADF). Of the $80 million, $51 million (OCR) will be used for the debt portion of the Dagachhu \ndevelopment, and $29 million (hard-term ADF) for the equity portion through lending to the \nGovernment. The borrower of the ADB loans will be the Kingdom of Bhutan. \n2. Equity  and  Debt  Structure. The Government will support the equity through Druk \nGreen Power Corporation (DGPC) with a leverage of ADB finance ($29 million). The balance of \nthe total equity ($80 million) will be mobilized from (i) public capital from the Government ($7 \nmillion), DGPC ($11 million), National Pension and Provident Fund (NPPF) ($12 million); and (ii) \nprivate resources of the Tata Power Company ($21 million). The debt balance of the total debt \n($121.5 million) is expected to be financed by the Austrian export credit agency, OeKB ($55.5 \nmillion), and NPPF ($15 million).

Issues \n1.  Bhutan generates significantly more electricity than it consumes. With a total installed \ncapacity of about 1,500 megawatts (MW) and a maximum domestic demand of 157 MW, \nBhutan is a net power exporter to India. The power sector accounts for a significant proportion \nof the gross domestic product (GDP) and provides the Government with more than 40% of its \ntotal  revenue.  Given  the  importance  of  the  power  sector,  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to \ncontinue to give priority to developing Bhutan\u2019s hydropower potential to increase government \nrevenues and provide an important input for economic growth and development with minimal \nenvironmental  impact.  In  2006,  the  governments  of  Bhutan  and  India  signed  an  umbrella \nagreement to develop and trade an additional 5,000 MW of hydropower by 2020. Now the \ngovernments aim to increase this target to 10,000 MW.   \n2.  The Government is looking to accelerate development of hydropower generation by \nleveraging  public  and/or  private  investments.  To  provide  the  framework  for  attracting \ninvestments in hydropower, the Hydropower Development Policy was formulated with technical \n1\nassistance (TA) support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  To accelerate hydropower \ndevelopment, the Government plans to restructure DOE to form the Energy Secretariat, which \nwill be the nodal agency for soliciting investment proposals and selecting developers through a \ncompetitive bidding and/or strategic process. \n3.  The  Government  has  already  consolidated  its  three  government-owned  hydropower \ncorporations (Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation, Basochu Hydro Power Corporation, Kurichhu \nHydro Power Corporation) by amalgamating them into a single corporation, Druk Green Power \nCorporation (DGPC) in January 2008. It also plans to merge the Tala Hydroelectric Project \nAuthority with DGPC in 2009. DGPC will be the agency responsible for implementation of \nhydropower  projects  to  be  developed  under  public\u2013public  and  public\u2013private  partnership \n2\nroutes.\n4.  Under a royal charter issued on 11 November 2007, a government holding company, \nDruk  Holding  Investment  (DHI)  was  formed  to  hold  the  shares  of  the  Government  in  11 \ncompanies in areas such as hydropower, banking, minerals, and natural resources, where the \ngovernment has a full or partial stake. DHI is expected to play a major role in accelerating the \nfuture development of Bhutan\u2019s hydropower resources since Bhutan Power Corporation and \nDGPC are now fully owned corporations of DHI. \n5.  As such, three government-owned organizations, DOE (the Energy Secretariat), DHI, \nand DGPC, will play a critical role in hydropower development in Bhutan. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (CDTA)  is  designed  to  (i)  promote \nhydropower development, which will contribute to Bhutan\u2019s economic growth, and (ii) enhance \nregionwide energy efficiency and cross-border cooperation. These impacts will be achieved by \n                                                          \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Preparing the Bhutan Power Development Project.\nManila. \n2  Under the Hydropower Development Policy, DOE will mainly promote and execute the bilateral projects. ", "48 Appendix 9 \nbuilding capacity to implement the Hydropower Development Policy. The CDTA will result in (i) \nstrategy and an action plan to broaden financing avenues for future large hydropower projects \nfor DGPC and DHI; (ii) internal capacity development within DGPC to manage development of \ncommercial hydropower projects on its own or through partnerships with private and public joint \nventures or foreign investment, and (iii) internal capacity building in DOE for promoting more \nprojects in line with bilateral programs and/or the policy. To make the results practical and \nvisible, the CDTA will be implemented through preparation of actual demonstration projects that \nwill focus on a financial structuring study and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project \ndesign document development.  \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The CDTA will have three focus areas. \n8. Component 1: Facilitating financing of DHI and DGPC for hydropower projects.\nThe CDTA will undertake a review of Bhutan\u2019s financial market, and associated policies and \nregulations to assess local financing potential as well as options to attract foreign investments \nfor future hydropower development. The study will look at innovative financing and contractual \noptions including initial public offers, divestment of shares, and issue of bonds. The consultants \nwill share international best practices and experiences from other countries for financing large \nhydropower projects. The CDTA will formulate a strategy and prioritized action plan for Bhutan. \nThe plan will include changes required in existing legal statutes, policies, and regulations to \nfacilitate greater access to financial markets for DHI and DGPC. \n9. Component  2:  Developing  internal  capacity  for  DGPC  to  manage  commercial \nprojects.  The  CDTA  will  support  DGPC  in  developing  internal  capacities  for  hydropower \nprojects under public\u2013public and public\u2013private partnership routes. This will include building \ncapacities for soliciting investments, evaluating financing proposals, and negotiating for off-take \ntariffs.  To  achieve  visible  and  tangible  results,  the  CDTA  will  prepare  and  study  practical \nfinancial structuring options for standby hydropower export projects, namely the Nikachhu (210 \nMW) and Khomachhu (326 MW) projects. In order for DGPC to become a project management \norganization to develop public projects allocated to DGPC, the CDTA will support DGPC in \ndeveloping  integrated  management  information  systems  to  effectively  conduct  project \nmanagement. and evaluate existing subsidiary companies and new project investments. To \napply emission reductions for CDM and the subsequent framework for climate change, the \nCDTA will assist DGPC in preparing the project design documents for any sample project(s).  \n10. Component  3:  Building  internal  capacity  in  DOE  for  accelerating  hydropower \ndevelopment in line with the Hydropower Development Policy. The CDTA will support \ncapacity  building  of  DOE  for  promoting  project  structuring,  conducting  due  diligence,  and \npreparing financing plans for these and other selected hydropower projects. The CDTA will \nassist DOE in acquiring additional capacity required in the areas of promotion, planning, design, \npower  tariff  negotiations,  contract  management,  environment,  social,  economic,  and  risk \nmanagement  areas  to  accelerate  hydropower  development  in  line  with  the  Hydropower \nDevelopment Policy. The CDTA will support DOE in restructuring to form the Energy Secretariat \nalong  with  identifying  specific  training  and  skill-building  requirements  in  the  newly  created \ndepartment under the secretariat. A study tour will be made to observe the policy and project \nimplementation, practices, and lessons from run-of-river and storage plant developments in \nanother country. The scope of work will include formulation of a captive power generation policy \nand a renewable energy policy with focus on small and micro hydropower projects, in line with ", "Appendix 9  49 \nthe Hydropower Development Policy and Electricity Act 2001, which will be reviewed and/or \namended under assistance from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. \n11.  Based on the training needs assessment, short-term external training programs will be \nprovided to key staff for capacity building. \nD.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The  CDTA\u2019s  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,512,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide \n$1,488,000. The CDTA will be jointly financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility \n($888,000) and the ADB technical assistance funding program ($600,000). The Government of \nBhutan will provide $24,000 equivalent of local currency costs through in-kind contributions, \nincluding  office  accommodation,  facilities,  data,  and  other  information.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are given in Supplementary Appendix B. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  DOE will be the Executing Agency for all CDTA components. DGPC and DHI will be the \nimplementing agencies for components 1 and 2. The DOE director general will be the project \ndirector, overseeing day-by-day CDTA implementation. DOE, DGPC, and DHI will help the \nconsultants liaise with other government ministries and agencies, local authorities, and other \nstakeholders in the project areas, and obtain data and documentation from them. They will \nassign the counterpart staff for each expertise areas for on-the-job-training and skills transfer. \nDOE will provide sufficient office space, furniture, and support facilities to the CDTA consultants \non time.\n14.  The CDTA will be implemented over 24 months from January 2008 to December 2010. It \nwill require 55.5 person-months of consulting services (40.5 international and 15 national). The \nareas of expertise and outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix B. ADB will \nengage a consulting firm or consortium of firms using its quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Equipment financed by the CDTA will be procured under ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).", "50 Appendix 10   \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nA.  Dagachhu Hydropower Development \n1. Methodology  and  Major  Assumptions.  The  financial  analysis  of  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower  development  of  the  Green  Power  Development  Project  was  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Cost streams used to determine the financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) reflect costs of delivering the estimated benefits. The weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) of the Dagachhu hydropower development was calculated and compared with the \nFIRR to ascertain financial viability. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the \nunderlying assumptions was also assessed. Based on this analysis, the Dagachhu hydropower \ndevelopment is determined to be financially viable.  \n2.  The costs of the development include all capital investment including civil works, roads \nand  bridges,  electric  and  mechanical  works  with  physical  contingencies,  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  and  resettlement  and  environmental  costs.  Additional  payments  are \nassociated with a 12% royalty power from the development to the Government for the initial 12 \nyears, and then 18% for the remaining 18 years. The hydropower development is assumed to \nhave a 30-year economic life and to revert to the Government at nil value at the end of the \nconcession period. \n3.  The tariff for the sale of energy generated has been agreed with the Tata Power Trading \nCompany (TPTC), India, and the power purchase agreement (PPA) has been signed with \nTPTC. The base-year tariff is agreed at Rs2.40/kilowatt hours (kWh) with 2% annual escalation \nover the 25-year PPA and a rebate of 2% for timely payment. Under the terms of the PPA, \nTPTC will buy at least 88% of the energy generated from the Dagachhu hydropower facility. For \nthe balance of the power, TPTC will ensure merchant sales on a best effort basis if required by \nDruk Green Power Corporation (DGPC). The delivery point will be the northern grid of India at \nthe India\u2013Bhutan border. All losses and taxes beyond the Bhutan border will be borne by TPTC. \nThis price includes all transmission costs, and taxes applicable in Bhutan. As payment security, \nTPTC will establish and maintain an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of Dagachhu Hydro \nPower Corporation (DHPC); the amount of the letter of credit will be the equivalent of the \nmaximum generating month during non-monsoon (8 months) and maximum generating month \nduring the monsoon (4 months). \n4.  The Dagachhu development was originally initiated as a Clean Development Mechanism \n(CDM)  case.  The  development  posted  its  application  to  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  website  for  public  comments  in  2007.  The \ngovernments of Bhutan and India have already approved it as a CDM project. Presently, a \nvalidation report is being prepared and DHPC will seek registration with the CDM Board of the \nUNFCCC.  Based on the advanced process, TPTC signed a term sheet to underwrite the \npurchase of emission reductions over 30 years at the minimum specific price in euros. These \nrevenues are duly considered in the analysis. \n5. Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The financing plan for computing \nthe WACC considers that equity contributions will be provided by the Government, DGPC, \nNational Pension and Provident Fund, and Tata Power Company. The debt component will be a \nmix  of  local  and  foreign  loans  including  the  ADB  loans.  The  cost  of  Dagachhu  equity  is \nconsidered at 14%. The domestic inflation rate is taken at 5.00% and the international inflation ", "Appendix 10  51 \nrate at 2.39% for the dollar component and 1.99% for the euro component. The average WACC \nfor the Dagachhu hydropower development is 5.63% (Table A10.1). \nTable A10.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Dagachhu Hydropower Development \nADB  OeKB Local\nSource Loan Credit Lender Equity  Total  \nA.

Calculation of FIRR and Sensitivity Analysis. The after-tax financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) is 10.44 % for the Dagachhu hydropower development, and compares favorably \nwith  the  estimated  WACC  at  5.63%,  substantiating  the  financial  viability  of  the  Dagachhu \ndevelopment. \n7.  Separate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse \nchanges in key variables: an increase in construction time by 6 months, a 10% increase in \nproject costs, and a 10% decrease in energy generation (Table A10.2). The results are robust \nwith the sensitivities exceeding the WACC; the development is most sensitive to a reduction in \nenergy generation. \nTable A10.2: FIRR Sensitivity Analyses: Dagachhu Hydropower Development \n  FIRR  DSCR \nItem    Variable  (%)  Minimum  Average \nBase Case      10.44  1.5  2.2 \nTime Period  +6 months  10.00  1.4  2.1 \nProject Cost  +10%  9.48  1.3  1.9 \nGeneration  \u201310%  9.38  1.3  1.9 \nWACC  5.63     \nDSCR = debt service coverage ratio, FIRR = financial rate of return, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \nB.  Rural Electrification \n8. Methodology and Major Assumptions. The financial analysis of the rural electrification \ncomponent was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of \nProjects. All financial costs and benefits are expressed in constant 2008 prices. Cost streams \nused for the FIRR determination reflect costs of delivering the estimated benefits. The WACC \nfor rural electrification was calculated and compared with FIRR for each of seven subprojects to \ndetermine the financial viability. The sensitivity of the FIRR to unfavorable movements in the \nunderlying assumptions was also assessed. The off-grid component for rural electrification is \nanalyzed in Supplementary Appendix L. ", "52 Appendix 10 \n9.  The  costs  include  all  capital  investment  including  civil  works,  material  costs, \ntransportation costs, operation and maintenance costs, social and environmental costs, and \nphysical  contingencies.  The  component  is  expected  to  have  a  30-year  economic  life  after \nconstruction. The base tariff for projections is the country\u2019s 1 July 2009 electricity tariff with \nannual escalation of 5%, which the regulator has already given notice under the multiyear tariff \nscheme.\n10. Calculation Weighted Average Cost of Capital. To compute the WACC, 79% of the \nfinancing source is assumed to be the interest-free Government loan (financed through the ADB \ngrant) and the remaining 21% in the form of Government equity to BPC. The cost of equity is \ncalculated at 6% after upward adjustments for the duration of the rural electrification component \nand associated risks. The average WACC for the rural electrification component is 0.20% (Table \nA10.3).\nTable A10.3: Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Rural Electrification \nGovernment  BPC\nItem Loan Equity  Total  \nA.

Calculation FIRR and Sensitivity Analyses. The FIRR is calculated at a negative \n5.99% for the rural electrification component. The rate compares unfavorably with the estimated \nvalue of WACC at 0.20%, indicating that the rural electrification component is not financially \nviable. A sensitivity analysis of the operation and maintenance cost element, capital costs, and \ntime overrun was completed to identify the implications of increase of these costs on component \nviability.  Table  A10.4  indicates  the  sensitivity  of  FIRRs  to  an  increase  in  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  capital  costs,  and  time  period.

The remaining equity of $33 million will be provided by the National Pension and \nProvident Fund ($12 million) and Tata Power Trading Company ($21 million). ADB plans to \nfinance another loan of $51 million from its ordinary capital resources. The Austrian export credit \nagency, OeKB, plans to provide export credit of $55.5 million for electromechanical equipment \nas debt. The National Pension and Provident Fund will also provide $ 15 million as debt. \n4.  Revenues. As per the power purchase agreement signed by DGPC with Tata Power \nTrading Company (TPTC), TPTC agrees to buy the generating power of the Dagachhu plant. \nThe tariff is set at Rs2.40/kilowatt-hour (kWh) (Rs2.35/kWh after a discount of timely payments) \nwith annual escalation of 2.0%. \n5.  Operation and Maintenance Costs. DHPC has established its corporate structure and \nemployed staff to fill various posts. Currently, DHPC is constructing the Dagachhu hydropower \ndevelopment with all salary expenses capitalized. The operation and maintenance expenses for \nDHPC are considered to be 1.00% of the development cost with annual escalation of 3%.  \n6.  Depreciation Cost. The average depreciation for the plant is estimated at 3.3% for \naccounting purposes. \n7.  Interest and Financing Charges. The interest rate is based on the weighted average \ncalculation from three streams of term loans:  \n(i)  from ADB with tenure of 30 years and an interest rate linked to the London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR) in dollars;  \n(ii) from OeKB with tenure of 19 years and a floating interest rate of 5.75% for 10% \nof the loan value and a fixed interest rate at 5.20% in euros for the balance (90%) \nof the loan value; and \n(iii) from a local lender (i.e., National Pension and Provident Fund) with a tenure of \n15 years with annual interest of 10%. \n8.  Interest during construction is capitalized at the rate of interest during construction. The \ninterest rate on working capital finance is taken at 12.0%. Working capital is taken as 1 month of \noperation and maintenance expenses and 1 month of receivables from the sale of power. \n9.  Transmission Losses. Transmission losses are calculated at 0.6% of gross generation. ", "54 Appendix 11 \n10.  Taxation. Income tax is calculated as 30% on profits. \n11.  Key  Financial  Performance  Indicators.  The  key  assumptions  underlying  the \nprofitability projections for Dagachhu hydropower development and the key financial parameters \nfor the first 5 full years of operations are presented in Table A11.1.  \nTable A11.1: Summary of Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation  \nFinancial Projections and Key Financial Ratios  \nYear ending 31st December  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016 \nRevenues (A) (Nu million)  569 1,161 1,185 1,224  1,250\nOperating Expenses (B) (Nu million)  41 84 86 89  92\nInterests (C ) (Nu million)  188 443 426 404  383\nTax (D) (Nu million)  58 110 124 145  160\nRepayments (E) (Nu million)  0 122 244 244  244\nCash Surplus (A-B-C-D-E)  282 402 305 342  371\nReturn on capital employed (%)  4.7 10.3 10.6 11.4  12.1\nFixed assets coverage ratio (times)  1.7 1.7 1.8 1.9  2.0\nProfits before depreciation/Sales (times)  1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1  1.1\nProfits after tax/Sales (times)  0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3  0.4\nDebt service coverage ratio (times) 2.5 1.7 1.5 1.5  1.6\nSource: ADB staff estimates.                       \n12.  The projected financial performance will maintain adequate debt service coverage ratios, \nwith  the  minimum  of  1.5  times  and  average  of  2.2  times.  This  clearly  indicates  that  the \nDagachhu development will generate cash surplus to fully service debt obligations and that it \nwill be in a position to finance its internal requirements from its own sources. The profitability \nrepresented by an internal rate of return on equity is 15.6% on a before-tax basis and 12.0% on \nan after-tax basis. \n2. Financial Management Assessment\n13.  As DHPC is in its inception stage, its financial accounting system is based on that \nfollowed by hydropower subsidiaries under DGPC. DHPC generally uses spreadsheet-based \nsoftware for accounting purposes. In some cases, DHPC has developed in-house software to \nrecord financial transactions. The project preparatory technical assistance supported DGPC\u2019s \nintegration of the accounting system among its subsidiaries and the accounting software is to be \ninstalled at DGPC and each of its subsidiaries to record financial transactions in a common \nformat. DHPC is expected to strengthen its accounting management and move from manual \naccounting procedures to an integrated computerized financial management and accounting \nsystem.\n14.  DHPC follows financial accounting on an accrual basis as per provisions of its governing \nstatutes and generally accepted accounting principles. As a company it is subject to audit under \nthe Companies Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan, 2000 and by the Royal Audit Authority. DHPC \nhas a chart of accounts to enable proper recording of financial transactions. Since DHPC was \nformed on 13 May 2008, it has not prepared its first set of financial statements.  ", "Appendix 11  55 \n15.  The  Future.  DHPC  will  strengthen  its  systems  and  move  from  manual  accounting \nprocedures to use of computerized management information and accounting systems. This will \nstrengthen project construction management, accounting, and reporting procedures; and later \nhydropower operating procedures. It will improve overall corporate accounting and financial \nreporting, and provide the basis for accurate and timely accounting and reporting procedures for \nADB loan-financed projects. To achieve these goals, the joint venture partners, DGPC and Tata \nPower Company agree to have the seconded or professional financial staff from Tata Power \nCompany assist DHPC financial management, in line with the shareholders agreement. DHPC \nand  DGPC  have  no  experience  managing  foreign  currency  debt  and  will  require  capacity \nbuilding for foreign exchange mitigation, fund raising, and concomitant risk management. These \nareas will be supported by a new technical assistance project for capacity development.  \nB.  Druk Green Power Corporation \n1.  Financial Performance \n16.  DGPC,  incorporated  in  January  2008,  was  formed  by  the  amalgamation  of  three \nhydropower generating companies: Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation, Basochu Hydro Power \nCorporation,  and  Kurichhu  Hydro  Power  Corporation.  Since  the  Tala  Hydroelectric  Project \nAuthority (THPA), commissioned in 2006, will be merged with DGPC in 2009 or later, it is not \nreflected in the historical financial performance of DGPC. Table A11.2 summarizes generation, \nexport sales, and financial performance of DGPC\u2019s subsidiaries.\nTable A11.2: Druk Green Power Corporation Generation, Sales and Financial Performance  \nYear Ended 31 December (Audited)  2004 2005 2006  2007\nGeneration and Sales   \nEnergy Production (GWh): Chhukha Plant (336 MW)  2,054 1,885 1,983  2,148\nEnergy Production (GWh): Basochu Plant (64 MW)  131 231 331  314\nEnergy Production (GWh): Kurichhu Plant (60 MW)  333 340 365  374\nExport Sales for Chhukha/Total (%)   75 71 72  89\nExport Sales for Basochu/Total (%)   0 0 0  0\nExport Sales for Kurichhu/Total (% )  90 83 82  73\nFinancial Results         \nChhukha Plant          \nReturn on Net Fixed Assets (%)  78 103 118  109\nDebt/Debt plus Equity (%)  10 6 3  0\nBasochu Plant          \nReturn on Net Fixed Assets (%)  3.5 2.3 3.7  1.3\nDebt/Debt plus Equity (%)  48 70 63  62\nKurichhu Plant          \nReturn on Net Fixed Assets (%)  (0.3) 0.8 1.1  0.8\nDebt/Debt plus Equity (%)  48 46 44  42\n( ) = negative value, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Druk Green Power Corporation. \n17.  The Chhukha plant has been making considerable profits and had an impressive reserve \nof Nu596 million, and cash and cash equivalents of Nu1,274 million ($32 million equivalent) in ", "56 Appendix 11 \n2007. As the plant is old, it has a low book value but continues to give economic benefits \nreflected by the high return on fixed assets at 109% in 2007. The debt to total assets ratio is low \nat 3% in 2006 and 0% in 2007.  \n18.  The Basochu plant has been showing an increasing trend in profits with profit after tax \nreaching Nu119 million in 2006 from Nu32 million in 2004. The debt to total assets ratio is high \nat around 62% in 2007. As the plant is relatively new, the return on fixed assets in 2007 is low at \naround 1.3%.\n19.  The Kurichhu plant had considerable losses until 2004. In 2005, the plant had a Nu39 \nmillion  profit.  However,  due  to  initial  years  losses  carried  forward,  the  amount  of  profits \ntransferred to the balance sheet is still negative Nu139 million in 2007. This is reflected in the \nreturn on net fixed assets, which has been maintained positive over these three years.  \n2.  Projected Financial Performance  \n20.  Capital Expansion Program and Funding. DGPC is planning to enter into additional \npower generation schemes including the Dagachhu hydropower development in 2009. These \ninvestments along with the regular capacity expansion and repair and maintenance activities \ncan be sufficiently financed through internal sources of DGPC, as DGPC has significant cash \nand cash equivalents as indicated in Table A11.3.  \nTable A11.3: Druk Green Power Corporation Capital Expenditure  \n(Nu million) \nParticulars 2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 \nCapital investment (A)  442 2,155 342 308 340 281  168 160\nNet cash flow before capital \ninvestment (B)  3,205 3,382 1,746 1,788 2,026 1,823  1,854 2,197\nFree cash flow after capital \ninvestment (B-A)  2,762 1,227 1,403 1,479 1,687 1,542  1,686 2,037\nSource: ADB and DGPC staff estimates. \n21.  Tariff  Revenue.  Export  sale  to  the  Power  Trading  Corporation  of  India  from  the \nChhukha plant is considered at a base rate of Nu2.0/kWh with a 5% escalation every 5 years, \nand that from Kurichhu plant at Nu1.80/kWh with a similar escalation. Domestic sale to Motanga \nis at Nu1.29/kWh with a similar escalation. Wheeling charges are unchanged at Nu0.13/kWh. In \naddition revenues from the sale of royalty power at Nu0.30/KWh and demand charges on a \nmonthly  basis  follow  the  same  escalation  principle.  Domestic  consumption  is  assumed  to \nincrease at 9% annually.  \n22.  Staff Costs. For the projected figures, employee costs are adjusted year-on-year at 6% \ntaking into account the effect of inflation and increase in staff grades. \n23.  General Administration Expenses. General administration expenses are escalated at \n6% annually from the base level of 2007.  \n24.  Depreciation Cost. Permanent buildings, compound walls, fencing, roads, culverts, and \ncivil works are depreciated at 3% whereas mechanical works, powerhouse generators, plant \nand  machinery,  transmission  lines,  and  substation  equipment  are  depreciated  at  5%. ", "Appendix 11  57 \nSemipermanent and temporary buildings are depreciated at 20% and 50% respectively. All \nother equipment is depreciated at 15%.  \n25.  Interest and Financing Charges. Interest charges on term deposits are considered at \n3% and interest for loans taken by Basochu is calculated at 6%.    \n26.  Taxation and Dividend. DGPC pays tax at 30%, and is assumed to pay 90% of its profit \nafter tax as a dividend to shareholders.  \n27.  Key Financial Performance Indicators. The opening financial position for DGPC as of \n1 January 2008 is based on the accounts of Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation, Basochu \nHydro  Power  Corporation,  and  Kurichhu  Hydro  Power  Corporation  for  the  year  ended  31 \nDecember 2007. Table A11.4 summarizes the results of the financial analysis for 2008\u20132015. \nThe debt to asset ratio is progressively declining as principal is being repaid and retained \nearnings are building up. The return on average net fixed assets is high at 21% in 2008 primarily \ndue to the Chhukha plant. This increase to more than 30% in later years as the plants, though \nhaving a low book value, are able to generate significant economic returns. To be conservative, \nTHPA is not included in this projection. \nTable A11.4: Summary of Druk Green Power Corporation \n Financial Projections and Key Financial Ratios \nYear Ending  \n31 December  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 \nTotal Revenues (Nu million)  4,374  4,473  4,660  4,611  4,568  4,529  4,489  4,657 \nTotal Expenses (Nu million)  1,541  1,508  1,522  1,472  1,464  1,446  1,447  1,450 \nProfit after Tax (Nu million)  1,983  2,076  2,196  2,198  2,173  2,158  2,129  2,245 \nCash and Bank Balances (Nu million)  2,762  2,620  2,082  1,868  1,940  2,132  2,023  2,285 \nTotal Assets (Nu million)  15,154  15,197  15,158  14,942  14,668  14,385  14,061  13,921 \nReturn on Average NFA (%)  21  23  25  26  27  29  29  33 \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times)  4.9  5.1  4.4  4.4  4.4  4.4  4.5  4.7 \nDebt/ Asset (Debt + Equity) (%)  58  53  46  40  33  27  21  15 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, NFA = net fixed assets, Nu = ngultrum. \nSource: ADB staff estimates.  \n28.  Once THPA (1,020 MW) is merged with DGPC in 2009 or later, DGPC\u2019s financial \nperformance will be much better. DGPC\u2019s strong balance sheet and profitability will enable it to \nmake leverage for external borrowing to execute more hydropower projects. This indicates that \nDGPC is in a position to contribute equity to new development projects from its own revenue \ngeneration and/or borrowing and be able to act as a public joint venture partner in public\u2013private \npartnership programs.  \n3.   Financial Management Assessment \n29.  Financial management  assessment was undertaken to assess the current ability of \nDGPC  to  fulfil  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  and  identify  areas  for  improvement.  DGPC \ncompleted  a  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  to  facilitate  a  review  of  its \nfinancial systems and processes, and to identify issues or constraints. \n30.  A chart of accounts and accounting manual for DGPC will be developed so that similar \naccounting and financial processes are followed throughout the organization. This requirement \nwill be significant when THPA is merged with DGPC in 2009. Presently, most of the hydropower ", "58 Appendix 11 \nplants and DGPC head office maintain accounting and financial systems using an off-the-shelf \naccounting package (i.e., Tally).  \n31.  DGPC follows financial accounting on an accrual basis as per provisions of its governing \nstatutes  and  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Being  a  corporate  entity  and  a \ngovernment company, it is subject to audit under the Companies Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan, \n2000 and the Royal Audit Authority. Since DGPC is expected to be the Government agency to \nundertake the public investment portion of new hydropower projects, it will need to leverage its \nbalance sheet to raise commercial financing including financing from international sources. \nThus\u00b8  DGPC  needs  to  strengthen  its  systems  and  processes  to  become  an  international \nfinancial reporting standards compliant entity so that it is easier to raise funds in international \nfinancial markets. \n32.  Accounting and financial reporting responsibilities are carried out as per a defined set of \ndelegation of powers, which needs strengthening. DGPC has no prior experience of managing \nforeign currency debt and will require capacity building for foreign exchange fund raising and \nconcomitant risk management. An important challenge for DGPC is management of financial \nresources for funding large investments in hydropower projects. DGPC will need to significantly \nenhance its capacity in the areas of financial reporting, financial management, management \ninformation systems, and budgeting. \n33. The  Future. The steps undertaken by DGPC to improve financial management will \nstrengthen project construction management, accounting, and reporting procedures; as well as \nimprove DGPC\u2019s overall management and operating performance. DGPC plans to implement \nan integrated computerized financial management and accounting system. Project preparatory \ntechnical assistance supported DGPC in preparing its consolidated balance sheet after merger \nof the three existing hydropower companies and in selecting the information systems to be \ninstalled for integrated accounting and financial management across the hydropower plants.  \nC.  Bhutan Power Corporation \n1.  Financial Performance \n34.  Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) was established on 1 July 2002 from the former \nDepartment of Power with a mandate to ensure that reliable, adequate, and affordable electricity \nis available to all citizens of Bhutan. BPC is responsible for transmission, distribution, and rural \nelectrification activities. As of December 2007, it had 77,433 customers. Overall transmission \nand distribution losses have been maintained at about 9%\u201310%.  \n35.  After losses from 2003 through to 2005, BPC had profits of Nu269 million in 2006 and \nNu456 million in 2007. This is reflected in the return on net fixed assets, which increased from \nminus 0.6% in 2004 to plus 4.9% in 2007. The company\u2019s debt component increased from 13% \nin 2004 to 31% in 2007 primarily due to increased borrowing from the 2007 transfer of THPA\u2019s \ntransmission debts to BPC.  Table A11.5 summarizes the BPC\u2019s financial performance for the \npast years.

Projected Financial Performance  \n36.  Capital Expansion Program and Funding. As a part of the capital expansion program, \nBPC  identified  many  areas  of  transmission,  distribution,  and  rural  electrification  where \nexpansion is required. Most of these activities are expected to be funded from internal sources \nof BPC (Table A11.6). A significant contribution is expected in the form of grants. \nTable A11.6: Bhutan Power CorporationProject Funding Source 2008\u20132018 \n(Nu million) \nInternal\nProject  Loans  Grant  Funding Total\nTransmission  0  3,463  7,897  11,360 \nDistribution  0  0  336  336 \nRural Electrification  3,073  0  320  3,394 \nHead Office  0  0  659  659 \nOthers  0  0  1,103  1,103 \nTotal  3,073  3,463  10,315  16,851 \nSource: Bhutan Power Corporation and ADB staff estimates. \n37.  Tariff Revenue. The consumer tariffs for BPC are determined by the Bhutan Electricity \nAuthority, which calculates the average cost of supply for each tariff category. The average cost \nof supply per kWh for high-voltage, medium-voltage, and low-voltage categories for 2007/08 \nwere computed as Nu1.62, Nu 1.93, and Nu 0.97 respectively. At present, the tariffs are fixed at \nNu1.43/kWh  for  high-  and  medium-voltage  consumers  and  Nu1.30/kWh  for  low-voltage \nconsumers. The subsidy obtained from royalty power has been directed at low-voltage tariffs \n(Nu750 million per annum), so the costs of supply for low voltage are not fully cost reflective. \nThe cost-reflective supply to low-voltage customers, excluding the royalty subsidy, is around \nNu3.4/kWh. The low-voltage tariff at Nu1.30/kWh covers 38% of this cost of Nu3.4/kWh. In 2007 \nhigh-  and  medium-voltage  consumers  subsidized  around  Nu1,045  million  for  low  voltage \ncustomers. For projection purposes, the supply tariffs are taken from the 1 July 2009 electricity \ntariffs, approved by Bhutan Electricity Authority under the multiyear tariff scheme, with annual \nescalation of 5% on the base tariff for projections.   \n38.  Staff Costs. BPC has around 1,450 staff and an employee cost for 2007 of about Nu323 \nmillion. For projection purposes, employee remuneration is increased at 5% for inflation and \nanother 2% for real increase in remuneration. \n39.  Operation  and  Maintenance  Expenses.  Operation and maintenance for projection \npurposes is escalated by 5% annually to take into account the effect of inflation. Proportional \nincrements for capacity expansion are duly considered.  ", "60 Appendix 11 \n40.  Depreciation Cost. The depreciation rate for transmission assets and customer service \ndepartment  line  assets  is  set  at  3.33%,  and  at  5.00%  for  customer  service  department \ngeneration assets. The assets at the head office are depreciated at 6.4% per annum. \n41.  Taxation and Dividend. Income tax is calculated at 30% of profits. BPC will set aside \naround Nu23 million from its net profit after tax for transfer to the general reserve and pay 20% \nof the remaining amount to shareholders as dividend.\n42.  Key  Financial  Performance  Indicators.  Table  A11.7  summarizes  the  results  of \nfinancial analysis for 2008\u20132017. Assuming tariffs subsidized by the royalty, BPC is expected to \nmaintain adequate profitability and debt service capacity. However, the profitability is likely to be \ngradually  declined.  BPC\u2019s  future  financial  performance  will  be  influenced  by  the  very  high \nproportion of rural electrification within its network and the need to work within tariff policies that \nincorporate high cross-subsidization.    \nTable A11.7: Summary of Bhutan Power Corporation Financial Projections and Key \nFinancial Ratios \nYear Ending 31 \nDecember  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017 \nTotal Revenue  \n(Nu million)  3,143  3,807  4,133  4,674  5,095  5,592  5,848  6,118  6,290  6,419 \nTotal Operating \nExpenses (Nu million)  2,214  2,780  3,183  3,590  3,903  4,376  4,611  4,909  5,174  5,463 \nProfit after Tax  \n(Nu million)  594   688   637  747  819  874  879   830  742  636 \nCash & Cash \nEquivalents (Nu million)  869  1,116  941  422  392  1,017  1,962  2,834  3,283  2,951 \nTotal Assets  \n(Nu million)  12,476  13,661  14,673  16,486  18,317  20,336  21,085  21,608  21,999  22,346 \nReturn on Net Fixed \nAssets (%)  5.8  6.2  5.3  5.3  5.2  5.2  5.4  5.2  4.7  3.9 \nDebt Service Coverage \nRatio (times)  4.60  5.10  4.70  5.10  5.20  6.00  6.00  5.00  4.60  4.40 \nDebt / Asset (Debt + \nEquity) (%)  19.4  20.6  22.2  25.1  22.8  22.1  21.3  20.2  18.8  17.5 \nSource: ADB staff estimates.  \n3.

BPC\u2019s Finance and \nAccounts Department has developed procedures and guidelines for this reporting.  \n46.  BPC follows financial accounting on an accrual basis as per provisions of its governing \nstatutes and generally accepted accounting principles. Being a corporate and a government \ncompany, it is subject to audit under the Companies Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan, 2000 and \nthe Royal Audit Authority.  \n47.  The  Future. BPC raises commercial financing for its investments from local banks. \nGoing forward, it may be required to raise commercial financing outside Bhutan for some of its \ninvestment requirements. BPC needs capacity building for raising and managing external funds. \nAnother  area  of  capacity  building  is  in  the  field  of  budgeting.  BPC  carries  out  an  annual \nbudgeting exercise for its all accounting units that needs to be well-documented in budgeting \nmanuals and procedures.  \n48.  The  detailed  financial  performance  for  DHPC,  DGPC,  and  BPC  is  analyzed  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. ", "62 Appendix 12   \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Dagachhu Hydropower Development \n1.  The 114 megawatt (MW) run-of-river Dagachhu hydropower development is on the left \nbank of the Dagachhu River in Dagana district. It is planned to be implemented under the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) as defined in the Kyoto Protocol. A dedicated transmission line \nfrom Dagachhu to Dhajay will evacuate power from the hydropower plant. This transmission line \nis energized at 220 kilovolts (kV), has a single circuit on a single circuit tower, and is considered \nas a part of this facility for economic evaluation. \n2. Generation Forecast. The generation system for the Dagachhu hydropower plant is \ndesigned to deliver power at a maximum flow of 50 cubic meters/second. Its mean annual net \nenergy  production  is  estimated  to  be  500  gigawatt-hours  (GWh),  while  the  net  energy \nproduction with 90% dependability is about 360 GWh. The economic analysis is based on its \neconomic life of 30 years. \n3. Cost. The Dagachhu plant is expected to be set up at an aggregate cost of $201.5 \nmillion  (including  soft and  hard  costs).  The  total  economic  cost considered  in  this current \neconomic assessment is $173.9 million, excluding price contingencies and financing costs. \n4. Benefits. The main benefit of the facility to Bhutan comes in the form of export of power \nto  India.  The  total  power  generated  is  expected  to  be  exported  at  a  border  price  of \nNu2.40/kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  and  a  2%  discount  on  timely  payment  leading  to  an  effective \nNu2.35/kWh. When Bhutan\u2013India subregional benefits are considered, they are in the form of \navoidance of operation of standby generation units of industrial, commercial, and agricultural \nconsumers  as  well  as  serving  domestic  consumers  more  hours  of  electricity  at  average \ndomestic tariffs. \n5.  Under the CDM, the development will seek emission reduction certificates that can be \nsold to provide additional revenues to the facility. These benefits are assumed to continue even \nafter  the  first  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  which  ends  in  2012,  the  year  of \nexpected commissioning of the power plant since Tata Power Trading Company in principle \nagreed  to  underwrite  the  purchase  of  emission  reductions  for  30  years  beyond  the  first \ncommitment period at specific minimum price.   \n6. Estimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return. Based on these assumptions, the \noverall Dagachhu facility has an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.8% for \nBhutan, indicating that it is economically viable. When the benefit to Bhutan\u2013India subregion is \nconsidered, power exported to India is assumed to eventually replace diesel standby generating \nsets in industry, commercial, and agricultural sectors, while domestic consumers are willing to \nconsume at their average electricity price. With these assumptions the EIRR considering the \nbenefits to the subregion rises to 22% (net present value at 12% discount rate is Nu488.3 \nmillion).\n7. Sensitivity Analysis. To test the robustness of the results, a sensitivity analysis was \nbased on a variety of parameters tested separately (Table A12.1).

Rural Electrification \n8.  The Government has updated the target for household electrification to complete 100% \nelectrification by 2013. The rural electrification component, which is intended to partially fulfil \nachievement of this target, is expected to be implemented by Bhutan Power Corporation. Most \nof the required data for the economic analysis was obtained from a comprehensive household \nsocioeconomic survey. The detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D and the \noff-grid subproject is analyzed in Supplementary Appendix L.   \n9. Demand  Forecast. Household demand is based on the willingness to pay and the \ncapacity to pay, values determined using the socioeconomic survey. The average monthly \nhousehold electricity consumption in the seven districts to be electrified is estimated to be about \n103 kWh. For other categories of consumers, energy demand projections used for the technical \ndesign  are  used.  For  medium-voltage  consumers,  the  capacity  projections  are  considered \nbecause of the two-part tariff. This forecast was extracted from the technical assumptions. \n10. Cost. Total economic cost of installation and commissioning of all feeders in the seven \ndistricts is estimated to be $29.27 million inclusive of physical contingencies. \n11. Benefits. In principle, the estimation of economic benefits will be based on an estimate \nof the household demand curve for energy. Economic benefits are assumed to be equal to the \narea under the demand curve, i.e., the sum of consumer surplus, cost savings, and revenue to \nBhutan  Power  Corporation.  For  other consumers  (low-voltage  bulk  and  medium  voltage), \neconomic benefits are derived from fuel savings and revenue to Bhutan Power Corporation. \n12. Estimation of the EIRR. To estimate the economic feasibility of the rural electrification \ncomponent, EIRR values were determined for feeders and districts in the targeted areas. Each \ndistrict exhibits EIRR values ranging from 13% to 26%, significantly higher than the threshold \n12% EIRR required by ADB for funding a project. The overall EIRR of the rural electrification \ncomponent is estimated to be 20%. \n13. Poverty Impact Analysis. Poverty impact analysis is carried out to establish the impact \nof rural electrification on poor population groups in different stakeholder categories. The share \nof the poor in net economic benefits is estimated (Table A12.2). The estimated poverty impact \nratio is 62%, implying that the poor are estimated to receive 62% of the net economic benefits.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nIn Bhutan, most of the population (about 70%) lives in rural areas, rural electrification is therefore a key issue in the \nGovernment\u2019s overall development strategy. For this reason, the Government is highly committed to develop and promote \nrural electrification projects, from which a larger part of the population is expected to benefit. Under the present 10th five-year \nplan, at least 25,000 households are expected to have access to electricity, raising the percentage of the population with \naccess to 84%. The Government now aims to increase this target to 100% for the next five years by 2013. \nAccess to electricity in rural areas is a key element of human development as well as economic growth. Electrification does \nnot only mean longer productive hours, it is also expected to improve health care delivery and education. Most of all, it means\na greater range of opportunities for rural people to exploit to improve their quality of life and capacity to generate income. It \nwill also benefit the living conditions of women and children, reducing the incidence of respiratory diseases and increasing \ntheir time for more productive activities. \nAnother immediate tangible benefit is the reduced use of costly energy sources, i.e., of kerosene and  wood. Rural \nelectrification provides electricity to public facilities such as health centers, schools, and other local community facilities.\nRural electrification under the Project will provide a stable supply of electricity as well as opportunities for commercial \nbusiness development and employment in extensive rural areas of Bhutan. Benefits from power export, owing to the \nincreased capacity given by the construction of a new run-of-river generation plant in Dagachhu, will contribute to the \ncountry\u2019s economic growth, providing low cost supply of electricity to customers including the most vulnerable households of \nthe poor. Regional development and use for clean and renewable energy will specifically benefit the poor beyond the country \nsince they are more adversely affected by pollution and environmental degradation. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention\n1. Key Issues\nThe Project has two major components: Dagachhu hydropower development and rural electrification. While the construction \nof a run-of-river hydro plant generally does not have direct benefits for local poor, rural electrification is expected to improve \nquality of life and bring new economic opportunities in increasingly remote areas of the country. \nThe Dagachhu hydropower facility\u2019s benefits are related to increased economic activities (particularly in restoration and small\nretail) around the plant site, increased accessibility due to construction of access roads connected to the main roads, and use\nof 15% of the revenue generated by the plant to subsidize lifeline customer tariffs. \nConcerning the rural electrification component, the socioeconomic impacts of electrification will be very positive in nature and\nconsiderable in scale. These include the beneficial impacts accrued from (i) improved lighting; (ii) improved education, as \nimproved lighting permits students to study for longer hours during the evening; (iii) improved health through decrease in \nsmoke emitted from kerosene wick-lamps leading to decreased eye and respiratory ailments; (iv) cleaner living environment \nas smoke emitted from kerosene lamps for lighting purposes is reduced; (v) promotion of weaving and other income-\ngenerating activities during the evening leading to enhanced incomes; (vi) facilitation of undertaking household chores during \nthe evening; (vii) promotion of recreational activities in the evening such as reading, watching television, and listening to the \nradio; (viii) promotion of social visits and interaction even after dark; (ix) making it easier to prepare for, perform, and conduct \nreligious ceremonies and prayers; (x) making it easier to deal with emergencies such as illnesses and child delivery at night, \nand (xi) decreased dependence on kerosene for lighting purposes means residents do not have to walk (in many instances for \ndays) to district headquarters to purchase kerosene and saves the cost of kerosene. \nThe poverty reduction potential of this component is significant since rural electrification is a pro-poor intervention that \nprovides an avenue for supporting social progress by dispersing benefits of electrification widely and equitably. The impact of\nrural electrification is enormous among smaller, more remote communities, where isolation presents an additional dimension \nto combating poverty and improving quality of life. ", "66 Appendix 13 \nThe component will contribute significantly to poverty reduction and promote equitable regional development, particularly rural\ndevelopment. It will also ensure that coverage in terms of electricity provision is equitable, and will support economic growth\nand sustainable development. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nB. In 2007, Bhutan had a population of 658,888, with 345,298 males (52.4%) and 313,590 females (47.6%); 43.5% is below \nthe age of 20 years, 34% between 20 and 39, 15.5% between 40 and 60, and 7% above 60 years. Sixty-nine percent live in \nrural areas. \nBy 2007, Bhutan had 29 hospitals, 179 basic health units, 514 dispensaries and outreach clinics, 1 Indigenous hospital, 21 \nindigenous dispensaries, and 150 doctors. In 2001, the doctor to person ratio was 1:7,476, by 2006 within a span of 5 years it \ndecreased to 1:4,312, with 90% of the population covered by health care. In 2002, 24% of women were attended to by trained \npersonnel during childbirth; by 2006 this had more than doubled reaching 57.1%. In the 1970s and 1980s life expectancy was \n47 years; about two decades later in the 2000s it has increased to 68 years. \nUntil the late 1950s monastic education was the only form of formal education in Bhutan; formal school-based education was \nintroduced only in the late 1950s. In 1959, the country had only 11 primary schools and enrolled a total of 440 children.a In \n1968 the first 20 Bhutanese completed high school (class X) education within the country.b By 2007, Bhutan had 1,158 \nschools and institutions catering to 169,776 students.  \nIn 2004, agriculture contributed 24.7% to the total economy, i.e., as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). It was also \nthe single largest sector, providing livelihoods to 79% of the population.c The contribution of agriculture to GDP has been \ngradually decreasing; in 2006 it accounted for 21.4% of GDP. This decline is only natural as the energy (hydropower) sector is \nexperiencing a boom and is set to overtake agriculture as the largest contributor to GDP. Nonetheless, agriculture was still the\nlargest contributor to GDP in 2006. Agricultural practices have changed tremendously. Until a decade ago, agriculture was \npracticed on a subsistence basis. Now an increasing number of farms are mechanized with sizeable investment in machinery \nand other inputs that are subsidized by the Government leading to increase in export of agricultural produce. \nThe major source of energy has traditionally been firewood, and it still represents the major source of energy consumption. \nWith the commissioning of the first two units of the Chhukha Hydropower Project in 1986, and the other two units in 1998, \nBhutan increased its electricity generation substantially and became a significant exporter of energy to India. In 2006, the total\nelectricity generated was 3,357.2 million units. The Kurichhu Hydropower Project has a generating capacity of 60 megawatts \n(MW) and Basochu 64 MW. The number of villages electrified increased from 1,210 in 2004/05 to 1,318 by December 2006. \nBhutan first opened to tourism in 1974 when only a handful of tourists visited. In 2001 Bhutan received a total of 6,393 \ntourists, within 5 years, by 2006, this number almost tripled with tourist arrivals totaling 17,342. \nIn 2001, the value of Bhutan\u2019s exports was Nu4,994.75 million, by 2006 the value of exports almost quadrupled to \nNu18,771.00 million. The value of imports in 2001 totaled Nu8,990.20 million and reached Nu19,011.00 million in 2006.  \nBoosted by earnings from Tala Hydropower Project, GDP grew at an average of more than 7% during the 9th five-year plan. \nThis growth was derived from the sustained expansion of electricity and construction, which experienced average annual \ngrowth of around 25% and 11.8% respectively. Trade and other services sectors grew at an average of 11.5%. Overall, \nelectricity continues to dominate the country\u2019s exports accounting for around half of the country\u2019s total export during the 9th\nFYP period. The country\u2019s per capita income is estimated to rise to $1,500 in 2006 from $835 in 2002. \nThe rural electrification component is an integral part of the rural electrification program under the 10th FYP (2008-2013) and\nwill help Bhutan achieve its target. Around 9,000 rural households mainly in seven districts,d including remote central and \neastern regions, will be connected to the main grid. In addition, 119 solar panels will be installed to electrify public utilities in \nextremely remote areas. \nOf the beneficiaries, 88% farm as their main activity (mainly rice and maize); 10% raise livestock; and the remaining 2% are \nemployed in some service activity, particularly hospitality (restaurants and small guesthouses). Additional information on \npoverty and social analysis are in Supplementary Appendix F. ", "Appendix 13  67 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nFor the Dagachhu hydropower component, affected people were consulted since September 2007 to define acceptable \nalignment of the access roads, and the most appropriate compensation package. All 25 affected families have opted for land-\nfor-land and chosen their preferred plot, which is currently being legally transferred to them. In addition, the affected families \nwho are losing land and crops for the construction of access roads have already been compensated for the loss of crops and \ntrees. They all accepted additional compensation for the crops at the end of the cropping season as they expect a sharp \nincrease in prices. The project authorities, along with local authorities, agree that the fairer market price will be available at the \nend of the cropping season (September) and they are willing to top up the present compensation with the necessary funds, as \nagreed with the affected people. All affected people have expressed their support for the Dagachhu hydropower component in \nview of the agreements reached with the authorities. For the rural electrification component, public consultations are \nmandatory to explain to the beneficiaries\u2019 acceptance of electrification, safety awareness of electricity, and the availability of \nfree electrification kits. These activities are completed. \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing   Consultation   Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes  No\nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. Consultations are ongoing in a constant and consistent manner. Given the small \nnumber of affected people, the approach of direct involvement in all relevant decisions seemed to be the best option and no \nspecific plan was therefore considered necessary. The consultations will be carried out during implementation as per \nBhutanese regulations. No plan is therefore prepared for further consultations and related activities are embedded into the \nimplementation of the Project. \nC.   Gender and Development\n1.  Key Issues. While the Dagachhu hydropower development is basically neutral to gender issues, rural electrification is \nexpected  to  make  positive  interventions  on  gender  development.  Women  in  the  rural  electrification  area  will  not  be \nconstrained by any discrimination in accessing the benefits that accrue from electrification. In fact, females will benefit more\nthan males as they remain indoors and perform household chores. The provision of electricity will not only make their chores \neasier but will improve their health condition since most of their respiratory and eye ailments are caused by the smoke emitted\nfrom firewood stoves and kerosene wick-lamps in poorly ventilated houses. Considering the status of women in the project \nareas, and considering that the rural electrification component is gender neutral, no specific measures (gender plans) are \nneeded for differential gender requirements as women are not specifically disadvantaged because of economic, political, or \nsociolegal discrimination and they do not face specific barriers to access and benefits of electrification. A gender-specific \nanalysis for the rural electrification component is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n2.  Key Actions.

The Dagachhu hydropower development of the Green Power Development Project will \nuse the water of the Dagachhu River to power the turbines. The run-of-river power plant is \nlocated on the left side of the Dagachhu River between river kilometer (km) 10.5 and 20.2, \nupstream of the Dagachhu\u2013Sunkosh confluence. The river stretch between the intake and \ntailrace outlet is about 9.7 km. The difference in riverbed elevation between the intake and outlet \nis about 296 meters (m), and the natural river gradient averages about 3%.  \n2.  The main components of the development are the weir and intake, desilter, headrace \nchannel and tunnel, surge shaft, pressure shaft, powerhouse (cavern) with two pelton turbines, \nand transformers for 220 kilovolt power transmission. The system is designed to convey a \nmaximum flow of 50 cubic meters/second. The plant will have an installed capacity of 114 \nmegawatts (MW). \n3.  The development will require land for the construction of these components. Although \nmost of the land required is within government-owned land some land required belongs to \nprivate individuals. Since Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy applies to all resettlement \neffects, irrespective of the scale of land to be acquired and regardless of the number of people \naffected,  a  resettlement  plan  is  a  mandatory  requisite  for  all  ADB-financed  projects.  This \nresettlement plan was prepared in keeping with ADB policy and in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998). \n4.  The  resettlement  plan  defines  affected  persons  as  those  who  stand  to  lose  as  a \nconsequence  of  the  project,  permanently  or  temporarily,  all  or  part  of  their  physical  and \nnonphysical  assets  including  homes;  communities;  productive  and  nonproductive  lands; \nresources such as forests, community lands, or important cultural sites; commercial properties; \ntenancy; income-earning opportunities; and social and cultural networks and activities.  \n5.  The Dagachhu development is classified as having \u201cnonsignificant\u201d resettlement effects \nsince it does not involve relocation and resettlement of any households and since the number of \nhouseholds affected is only 25, and the total number of affected persons in the 25 households is \n145, which is less than 200. Moreover, the development does not affect any structures (house \nor living quarters, other physical structure, commercial or industrial structure, and rented or \noccupied commercial premises) or religious, community, or cultural sites. Therefore, following \nADB guidelines, a full resettlement plan is not required since the resettlement effects are not \nsevere enough to warrant it, and a short resettlement plan will sufficiently protect the interests of \nthe affected people.  \n6.  To minimize the effects of resettlement, as far as possible vacant government land was \nidentified for the location of project infrastructure, and the acquisition of private land was kept to \nthe essential bare minimum. Other measures to minimize resettlement effects include (i) access \nroad contractors are to avoid affecting homesteads even if this causes some realignment of the \naccess roads design; (ii) efforts were made to avoid affecting larger settlements, resulting in no \nfamilies being displaced; (iii) during design, extra care will be taken to ensure that religious \nstructures and public property are avoided; and (iv) stone crushing units and other noise-\ngenerating activities will be located away from residential areas as far as possible to mitigate the \neffects of noise pollution. Similarly, air pollution caused by dust, will be alleviated by locating \nmachinery and equipment that cause air pollution away from residential areas. ", "70 Appendix 14 \n7.  The total amount of land to be acquired from affected people is 27.42 acres. Of this, \nabout  19.99  acres  is  Kamzhing  (dry  land  including  orange  orchards)  and  7.43  acres  is \nChhuzhing (wet land or paddy fields). Of the 27.42 acres, 2.61 acres falls under Kana, 16.27 \nacres falls under Khebisa, and 8.54 acres is under Goshi. Overall, about 2.7% of the total \npopulation of the three affected blocks (about 5,363 people) is affected by the DHP.\n8.  The total amount of standing crops affected is 3.1 acres of paddy and 8.16 acres of \nmaize. The total number of fruit trees affected is 388 orange trees. \nA.  Policy Framework and Entitlement Matrix \n9.  This resettlement plan provides a review of Bhutan\u2019s policy framework and laws and \nregulations pertinent to the development and its effects, including the identification of policy \ngaps  in  land  acquisition,  land  replacement,  and  cash  compensation.  It  also  provides  an \noverview of ADB\u2019s policy on resettlement and recommends measures to make Bhutan\u2019s policies \ncompliant with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n10.  The basic principles adopted in the resettlement plan are (i) involuntary resettlement and \nloss of land, structures and other assets, and incomes will be avoided and minimized by \nexploring all viable options; (ii) affected people will be provided with compensation for their lost \nassets, incomes, and businesses; and provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist \nthem  to  improve  or  at  least  maintain  their  preproject  living  standards,  income  levels,  and \nproductive capacity; (iii) lack of legal rights to the assets lost will not bar affected persons from \nentitlement to such compensation and rehabilitation measures; (iv) replacement of affected \nassets (land, crops, fruits, structures) will be provided at the 2008 rates fixed by the Property \nAssessment  and  Valuation  Agency  (PAVA).  However,  if  the  difference  between  the  rates \nadopted  by  PAVA  is  found  to  be  significantly  lower  than  current  local  market  rates,  an \nindependent assessment of current local market rates will be undertaken and this will be used \nas  a  basis  for  making  compensation;  (v)  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  and  their \nimplementation will be carried out with participation and consultation of affected people; (vi) a \nbudget schedule for resettlement planning and implementation must be incorporated into the \noverall development, and; (vii) payment of compensation or replacement of affected assets \nmust be completed prior to the award of civil works contract, apart from the access roads. \n11.  To implement these principles, 16 policies were developed in the resettlement plan and \nwill be applied when implementing the plan.  \n12.  A detailed section on entitlements in the plan covers eligibility and entitlements for \nvarious categories of losses. The entitlement matrix is provided in the Table A14.1. \n13.  Compensation for land acquired by the development will be on a land-for-land basis as \nfar as possible. Cash compensation for land acquisition will only be made if the affected person \nconcerned  insists  even  after  being  advised  otherwise.  The  replacement  land  must  be  of \nequivalent size as the land acquired and of similar productivity standards and potential. The \nreplacement land must, as far as possible, be within the immediate vicinity of the affected land \nor close to it to avoid causing inconveniences to the already affected person.

If paddy fields are acquired and undeveloped land is provided as replacement land, then \nthe affected person is entitled to \u201cland development costs\u201d for converting the undeveloped land \ninto paddy fields. The market rate for such land development costs is estimated to be Nu60,000 \nper acre. This rate was arrived at after consulting with officers of district offices, the affected \npeople in the project area, and farmers in other districts. \n15.  Cash  compensation  will  be  paid  for  loss  of  standing  crops  and  fruit  trees.  The \ncompensation  rates  will  be  determined  by  PAVA  (PAVA  expects  to  finalize  the  2008 \ncompensation  rates  by  September  2008),  an  agency  instituted  by  the  Government  to  set \ncompensation rates. The 2008 compensation rates are expected to be in line with current local \nmarket valuation.  \n16.  Site  selection  for  replacement  land  will  be  carried  out  by  the  affected  persons \nthemselves in consultation with the land records officers of the Dagana district office and the \nexecutive officers of the block offices. This has been agreed to by the district authorities. The \naffected persons will be given the choice of choosing replacement land of their preference from ", "72 Appendix 14 \nwithin the same block (if vacant government land is available) to avoid causing encumbrances \nto affected people and to minimize complaints and grievances about the replacement land. In \nfact many affected people have already selected and identified their replacement land. \nB.  Grievance Redress Mechanism \n17.  A two-tier grievance redress committee has been set up for the affected people who will \nhave  the  right  to  file  complaints  and/or  grievance  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement such as inventories, valuation, and entitlements. Any affected persons who have \nhad their land, crops, fruit trees, or structure expropriated or altered and believes that they have \nnot been compensated or assisted in compliance with their entitlements will be able to express \ntheir  grievances  through  the  two-tier  grievance  redressal  mechanism  instituted  under  the \nresettlement  plan.  Three  grassroots  redressal  committees,  gewog  grievance  redressal \ncommittees (GGRCs) have been set up (one in each of the three affected blocks [gewogs]). The \nGGRCs comprise members elected by the affected people themselves and selected on the \nbasis of who could best represent and voice their grievances. Over 90% of GGRC members are \naffected people themselves. The executive officer of the respective block office will chair the \nGGRC.\n18.  A  higher-level,  grievance  redressal  committee  has  been  set  up  at  for  the  districts \n(dzongkhags). The dzongkhag grievance redressal committee (DGRC) is chaired by the chief \nexecutive officer of Dagana district. The DGRC comprises the district agricultural officer(s), \nforest officer(s), land record officer(s), finance officer(s), and engineer(s) as its members. \n19.  If the grassroots grievance redress committee is unable to resolve the grievance, within \n1 week it must pass the unresolved grievance to the DGRC. If the DGRC is unable to resolve \nthe grievance, then the DGRC must, within 2 weeks, refer the complaint or grievance to the \nNational  Land  Commission,  which  is  the  highest  body  to  approve  land  replacement  and \ncompensation allotments in the country. If the National Land Commission is unable to resolve \nthe grievances referred to it, then the affected people have the right to appeal to the courts or to \nHis Majesty, the King of Bhutan who is the ultimate arbitrator in the country. The grievance \nredress procedures are summarized in Table A14.2. \nTable A14.2: Grievance Redress Procedure\nStep 1: GGRC deals with grievance within 7 days of receipt of complaint from affected person. If unresolved, \nStep 2: DGRC deals with grievance within 2 weeks. If unresolved the grievance is forwarded to the National Land \nCommission,\nStep 3: The National Land Commission deals with the grievance. If unresolved, \nStep 4: The affected person has the right to appeal to the courts or to His Majesty, the King of Bhutan. \nC.  Consultation and Disclosure \n20.  The  resettlement  plan  was  disclosed  to  the  affected  people  and  the  public  (all \nstakeholders)  for  review  and  comments  on  the  various  mechanisms  and  entitlements  for \nimplementation of the plan. The intention of this procedure was to receive comments from \naffected  families  in  particular  so  that  appropriate  suggestions  can  be  incorporated  in  the \nresettlement  plan  and  at  later  stages  of  implementation.  Relevant  components  of  the ", "Appendix 14  73 \nresettlement plan were translated into the national language (dzongkhag) and placed at the \nblock office, office of the Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (DHPC), and their websites.  \n21.  An institutional framework prepared as a separate section assigns specific roles and \nresponsibilities to relevant agencies and individuals to implement the resettlement plan. Various \ncommittees such as the dzongkhag resettlement committee, internal monitoring committee, and \nthe  Resettlement  Cell  within  DHPC  have  been  established.  Moreover,  the  resettlement \ncommissioner, chief resettlement officer, and district resettlement officer have been identified \nand  their  roles  and  responsibilities  designated.  The  main  report  provides  details  on  the \nfunctions, role, and responsibilities of individual officials and committees. \nD.  Budget \n22.  The  budget  required  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan  is  provided  Table  A14.3. \nHowever,  the  resettlement  cost  estimate  and  budget  are  subject  to  revision  when  PAVA \nfinalizes the compensation rates for 2008, particularly for standing crop loss and loss of fruit \ntrees.

", "Appendix 15  7 5\nABSTRACT OF SUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENT EXAMINATION \n1.  The Green Power Development Project is classified as Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nenvironment category B. In Bhutan, the National Environment Commission (NEC) is the apex \nbody that oversees environmental protection and issues environmental clearance mandatory for \nany projects and activities that may have adverse environmental impacts. Bhutan released the \nNational Sustainable Development Strategy of Bhutan in 2006. Other major environmental acts \ninclude Environment Assessment Act 2000, the Forest and Nature Conservation Act 1995, and \nthe Biodiversity Act of Bhutan 2003. \nA.  Dagachhu Hydropower Development \n1.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n2.  The  Dagachhu  development  won\u2019t  encroach  on  any  declared  protected  areas,  or \nundermine the rich cultural heritage sites of Bhutan. Some localized impacts due to construction \nactivities could be mitigated or minimized by implementing the designed mitigation measures.  \n3.  The physical, biological, and social impacts identified and the scope for mitigation and \nenhancement measures, provide obvious reasons from an environment perspective why the \ndevelopment should not be implemented. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) report \n1\nprepared by the Department of Energy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs,  and approved by \nNEC proposes measures to mitigate potential impacts along with measures to enhance positive \nimpacts of construction and operation of the Dagachhu hydropower plant. The enhancement \nmeasures should receive equal attention as the proposed mitigation measures. \n4.  Potential increases in air, water, and noise pollution due to construction activities will be \nminimized by taking proper mitigation measures and are not expected to exceed the compliance \nstandards provided in the respective 2003 NEC regulations. The river water quality is unlikely to \ndeteriorate because the water circulates relatively quickly. \n5.  Mitigation measures are included in the environmental management plan (EMP) that \nconstitutes an integral part of the EIA preparation and is subject to implementation by the \nDagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (DHPC). The EMP approved by NEC covers all aspects of \nenvironmental issues in connection with the plant site and activities. The EMP is arranged for all \nthree phases: preconstruction, construction, and operation. The EMP lists possible impacts and \nproposes adequate mitigation measures. The expected impacts are similar to those that are \ncharacteristic of other medium-size hydropower developments including effects from excavated \nsoil, worker safety, increase in air quality and noise pollution, handling construction and solid \nwaste, electrical fire hazards, and safety aspects of facility operation and management. All \nidentified impacts are ranked as low or medium, and appropriate mitigation measures are \nproposed for implementation through DHPC. The EMP outlines such mitigation measures as \ntransporting of excess soil and rocks to designated dump sites, and ground leveling; slope \nstabilization and revegetation to prevent slides and soil erosion along access roads and river \nbanks;  appropriate  handling  of  construction  waste  and  hazardous  waste  (if  applicable)  to \ndesignated  disposal  sites;  setting  up  barriers  and  check  posts  to  prevent  poaching; \nimplementation of electric shock and fire prevention safety measures; regular water sampling to \nassure early detection of water-borne diseases; data collection of hydrological flows to assure \nimplementation  of  the  minimum  ecological  water  flow  requirements;  water  reservoir \n                                                          \n1  The document was prepared under the feasibility study funded by the Government of Austria. ", "76 Appendix 15 \nmanagement including sampling downstream water quality to detect riverbed sedimentation \nlevels;  and  proper  handling  of  transformer  oil  replacement.  All  recommended  mitigation \nmeasures reflect industry best practices on environmental mitigation actions for hydropower \nfacilities.  \n6.  Specific  issues  addressed  in  the  preconstruction  phase  include  (i)  environmental \nclearance, that is mandatory to obtain as per the Environment Assessment Act 2000 before \ninitiation of any project activities (completed); (ii) preparation of a resettlement plan (completed); \n(iii) incorporation of environmental requirements in project design particularly inclusion into \ncontract clauses; and (iv) monitoring of implementation of the EMP and resettlement plan. \n7.  EMP-specific issues for the construction phase include the following (i) setting up an \nenvironmental management unit within DHPC (completed); (ii) coordination with the project \nengineering  unit  to  incorporate  environmental  concerns  into  civil  works  contracts;  (iii) \nenvironmental capacity building including contractor\u2019s engineer; (iv) monitoring of civil works \nexecution; (v) monitoring of wildlife indicators; (vi) monitoring of social indicators; and (vii) \nreporting and mitigation measures rectifications. \n8.  Particular  issues  to  be  addressed  during  post  construction  are  basically  the \nimplementation of monitoring and mitigating activities including downstream flow variations, \nreservoir  management,  downstream  water  quality  management,  and  insect  vector  disease \nmanagement. \n9.  The Government-approved EIA report recommends a minimum flow (ecological flow) \nrelease from the dam 1.4 cubic meters per second (roughly in the range of 5%\u201310% of the \nmean annual natural flow) to support animal life, in particular fish migration from March to April \n(to spawning site) and from September to October (return to lower altitude for warm water). \nHowever, because only limited data on baseline water quality and aquatic habitat patterns was \ncollected, DHPC will continue to conduct a separate study on collection of baseline water quality \nindicators (for subsequent monitoring during implementation) and aquatic species migration \nroutes and spawning sites for enhancing mitigation measures through potential installation of a \n2\nfish ladder (or other means of facilitating fish migration).  DHPC will reflect the results of the \nstudy in the design and construction works.    \n10.  The  development  will  result  in  minimal  negative  social  impacts.  It  will  impact  25 \nhouseholds with part of their landholdings on the plant site or needed for construction of access \nroads (not financed by ADB). DHPC has compensated affected people as per the Land Act of \nBhutan 1979 and Land Compensation Rates 1996. In addition, DHPC agreed to pay for affected \ncrops using market rates at the end of the cropping season.  \n11.  Social impacts from the hydropower plant are expected from the influx of about 1,500 \nconstruction workers into the area during the construction, although the number of workers for \neach site is minimal. Nevertheless, subsistence agriculture has been the norm for centuries, and \nestablished social and cultural institutions will shape people\u2019s understanding. Thus, special \nattention  will  be  given  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  of  the  interaction  between  existing \ncommunities and the construction work force. \n                                                          \n2  The environmental study will be conducted by the technical assistance consultant (the terms of reference are given \nin Supplementary Appendix B). ", "Appendix 15  77 \n2.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n12.  The Executing Agency, Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC) will be responsible for \noverall implementation of the EMP. Specifically, DGPC will be responsible for management, \ncoordination, and execution of all activities funded under the ADB loans. DGPC will bear overall \nresponsibility for providing regular monitoring reports to ADB as specified in the EMP. DHPC as \nthe Implementing Agency, will be responsible for construction and operation of the plant, and \nimplementation of the EMP.  \n13.  DHPC has already set up an environmental unit headed by an environmental manager \nand support staff. The unit will be responsible for day-to-day monitoring of EMP implementation \nand preparation of environmental monitoring reports as specified in the EMP. DHPC will assure \noverall  environmental  compliance  and  adherence  to  the  required  mitigation  measures  as \nspecified in the EMP. It will be responsible for reporting any changes in the project scope (e.g., \naddition of new civil works or changes of access roads alignments and the tunnel layout) to \nDGPC. DGPC will, in turn, inform ADB about any changes proposed to the agreed scope of \nworks. If ADB finds that the changes will have impacts on environmental safeguard compliance, \nDGPC will be required to complete either initial environmental examinations (for category B \nprojects) or a full EIA if the changed scope is categorized as an environmental category A.  \n3.  Public Consultations and Disclosure \n14.  DHPC will acquire land for the construction of the Dagachhu plant. Although most of the \nland required is government-owned land, some land will be required from private individuals. \nThe land acquisition exclusively concerns the access road construction, but not the reservoir \nand dam building. No activities take place in environmentally protected areas, and thus the \nconsultations  were  held  with  people  affected  due  to  access  road  construction.  The  EIA \napproved by NEC indicates that water quality and fish migration will not be affected to the extent \nthat family incomes (from fishery) or dietary habits of the local population will be altered.  \n4.  Conclusion \n15.  The Dagachhu hydropower plant will generate moderate to low environmental impacts \nthat can be alleviated through a set of mitigation measures proposed in the EMP. None of the \nidentified  potential  impacts  will  be  of  an  adverse  nature  requiring  additional  studies  or \ncomplementary mitigation programs (with the exception of a thorough study on baseline water \nquality  and  aquatic  species  seasonal  migration  to  be  completed  for  monitoring  purposes). \nOverall, hydropower generation as a renewable energy source will contribute significantly to the \nsocioeconomic development of the country and the region, and improve the standard of living \nfor the population.\nB.  Rural Electrification \n1.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n16.  During the construction stage, the activities that can cause potential environmental and \nsocial impacts generally include (i) clearance of the right-of-way where distribution lines pass \nthrough forested areas; and (ii) soil excavation and line stringing during the pole and line \ninstallation. The operation phase is not expected to have any major negative impacts because \n(i) rural electrification schemes normally operate with routine maintenance and only occasional \nrepairs; and rural electrification infrastructure is inspected and maintained by Bhutan Power ", "78 Appendix 15 \nCorporation (BPC) regularly, so that repairs should be small in scale. Once the system is \noperating the main risks will relate to probable occurrence of accidents harming workers during \nmaintenance or repairs to the system.   \n17.  To avoid or reduce environmental impacts, the mitigation designs and actions include \n(i)  narrower coverage of right-of-way  to avoid branches touching the line compared \nto the standard requirement;  \n(ii) routing of the lines along existing farm roads and footpaths to reduce the cutting \nof new trees; \n(iii) installation of covered conductors for lines near protected areas and biological \ncorridors to ensure that local habitat is not in danger of electroshocks;   \n(iv)  terms of reference for all civil works to require employing manual labor under the \nguidance  of  field  environmental  officers  to  reduce  the  impacts  of  (i)  heavy \nmachinery tracking through forest areas; and (ii) cutting mature trees that have \necological value;  \n(v)  locating poles on field boundaries where the lines cross agricultural areas, to \nreduce the loss of productive land; \n(vi)  marking  the  right-of-way  boundary  and  prohibiting  workers  from  trespassing \noutside;\n(vii) limiting  tree  cutting  to  samples  marked  as  approved  for  cutting  by  the \nDepartment of Forests; \n(viii) adequately  equipped  labor  camps  including  sanitation  facilities  and  serviced \naccommodation; and \n(ix)  screening  of  workers  for  infectious  diseases  and  providing  free  treatment  if \nnecessary.\n18.  Although some of the distribution line will run close to protected areas and through \nbiological corridors, all lines are aligned along the existing or planned roads and highways, and \npoles are placed at road curbs. The Road Act of Bhutan (2004) states that for all roads \nconstructed and maintained by the Department of Roads (DOR) that 15 meters on either side of \nthe motors road is DOR property, irrespective of whether such roads are constructed or passing \nthrough protected areas. If a distribution line is located within 15 meters of the roadside, it is \nconsidered  to  be  located  on  DOR  property  and  the  line  installation  is  not  subject  to \nenvironmental requirements applicable for works performed within protected areas (the Road \nAct of Bhutan, 2004).\n2.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n19.  Each  subproject  for  each  district  will  be  managed  and  implemented  within  the \ninstitutional framework that already exists in Bhutan for the provision of rural electrification \nservices.  The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  as  the  Executing  Agency,  is  responsible  for \nmanagement, coordination and execution of all activities funded under the loan. BPC as the \nImplementing  Agency  is  responsible  for  construction  and  operation  of  all  subprojects. \nImplementation will be managed centrally by the BPC\u2019s Project Implementation Unit where a \nproject manager and staff have already been appointed.  \n20.  By August 2008 the national environmental clearances for all subprojects were obtained \nfrom NEC. Environmental issues have been coordinated by the BPC Environmental Unit, which \nensures that all subprojects comply with ADB and national environmental safeguards. Initial \nenvironmental examinations and other documents were developed for all subprojects during ", "Appendix 15  79 \nproject preparation to comply with ADB and the Government requirements. In the unlikely event \nthat further study is required, this will be conducted by the BPC Environmental Unit and/or by \nthe BPC-recruited environment consultants.\n3.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n21.  More than 2,000 people attended 26 public consultation meetings organized by DOE, \nBPC, and the consultant in each of the districts. Primary stakeholders included residents of \ntarget households and owners/users of facilities to be electrified; people who work on farmland \nthat is crossed by the lines; and owners and users of land that is acquired for the erection of \npoles. Secondary stakeholders are DOE, BPC, Department of Forests as the custodian of \nprotected areas and other forested land through which the lines will pass, NEC as the authority \ngranting  environmental  clearances,  other  government  institutions;  nongovernment \norganizations working in affected communities, and ADB. \n22.  Public meetings were organized with the objectives of disseminating information to local \ngovernment officials and the community about the rural electrification component, to explain \npotential impacts and mitigation measures; and to solicit the views of the community and clarify \nany issues or doubts regarding the undertaking. Prior to each meeting, the local government \noffices were contacted to set the date, time, and venue for the meeting.  \n4.  Conclusion\n23.  The environmental impacts of the rural electrification infrastructure proposed by the \nProject were assessed by initial environmental examinations summarized in this section in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines\n(2003). The overall conclusion is that through implementation of the mitigation measures, no \nsignificant negative impacts will result from the location, design, construction, or operation. The \nanalysis does not include any uncertainties, and no additional studies are required to address \nfurther concerns or to comply with ADB procedures or national laws.
