Improved project implementation and administration constitute a focus of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and its borrowers. Since 1978, the regional and country project \nimplementation and administration seminars funded by ADB technical assistance (TA) grants \nhave  helped  borrowers  and  their  executing  agencies  (EAs)  strengthen  their  capacities  to \nmanage project implementation. Senior and middle-level officials of EAs, central ministries, \nstate  banks,  and  state  and  provincial  governments  from  34  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs) have participated in these seminar programs covering the procurement of goods, works \nand  consulting  services,  as  well  as  disbursement.  This regional  TA  (RETA)1 aims  to  hold \ncountry  seminars  in  approximately  nine  DMCs,  two  subregional  seminars,  and  a  regional \nseminar at ADB headquarters in the period July 2007 to June 2009. The RETA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Country portfolio review missions and regular project supervision missions continue to \nobserve that delays in project implementation are largely caused by a lack of understanding of \nand  unfamiliarity  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and  guidelines.  There  is  a  continuing  need  for \ntraining for EA and staff of project implementing units (PIU), with a program designed to meet \nthe needs of both ongoing and new projects, as well as provide different levels of skills. DMCs \nalso  appreciate  that  familiarity  with  ADB  procedures  will  ultimately  lead  to  better  project \nimplementation that avoids or reduces delays, leading to early delivery of project benefits and \nsavings in commitment charge payments. \n \n3.  This  RETA  is  designed  to  address  deficiencies  in  project  implementation  and \nadministration by upgrading or updating the skills of EA and PIU personnel in an adaptable and \nflexible manner. The training will (i) familiarize participants from new EAs and PIUs with the \nADB Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time); ADB disbursement procedures, and other \nassociated subjects in project administration; and (ii) train other officials from EAs that may have \nadministered ADB-assisted projects but may need to transfer and replace staff of ongoing ADB-\nassisted projects, or acquire new staff for new projects, or both.  \n \n4.  The RETA supports capacity-building, particularly in fulfilling two objectives: institution \nstrengthening and human resource development. The training programs indirectly support other \ngovernance strategies on improved accountability, transparency, and anticorruption efforts. \n \n5.  Evaluation and feedback from seminars indicate that the training programs strengthen \nparticipants' professional skills and increase their understanding of ADB\u2019s requirements for \nproject implementation and administration. Past lessons learned from these seminars have led \nto amendments to clauses in the standard bidding documents, as well as to changes in the \ncontent and focus of case studies and exercises in seminars. The seminars\u2019 structure and \ncontent are continually revised and improved on the basis of suggestions from participants and \nin response to the changing needs of EAs and ADB.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 18 May 2006. \n ", "2   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The seminars will enable project directors, managers, and other key staff members of \nEAs, PIUs, and other government counterpart agencies to develop the required proficiency in \nproject implementation and administration following ADB policies and procedures. The seminars \nwill provide tools and information on ADB's guidelines and procedures in procuring goods and \nworks,  selecting  and  engaging  consultants,  and  making  disbursements.  The  new  stock  of \nknowledge gained by personnel and officials will upgrade the implementing capacity of EAs and \nDMCs in general. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  It is estimated that nine country seminars on project implementation and administration, \ntwo subregional seminars (possibly for the Pacific and Central Asian DMCs), and one regional \nseminar to be held at headquarters will be conducted. The seminars will have similar formats, \nschedules, and content. New methods of delivering the seminar content will be adopted based \non the results of the pilot test undertaken in the previous RETA. These will be more interactive, \nwith greater use of the Internet, when feasible. As an option to the traditional \u201ccomponent-\nbased\u201d seminar where the modules and topics involve general discussions of procurement, \nconsultant selection, and disbursement procedures, the seminar program  may  be \u201cproject-\nbased,\u201d  i.e.,  the  same  topics  are covered  but  the  cases  and  exercises  are  focused  on  a \nparticular project or group of projects in the host DMC. The factors that will be considered in \ntailoring the program and mix, subjects and durations of lectures and case studies to the \nspecific country and regional seminars are the profile and capacity of participants, the types of \nprocurement planned, and the implementation issues currently faced by or expected from the \nparticipating project or projects. \n \n8.  The nine country seminars, each lasting 6 to 9 days, will be conducted in DMCs (i) \nwhere  loans  approved  in  2006  and  2007  involved  or  will  involve  new  EAs  and  PIUs,  (ii) \nreceiving a large number of loans annually, (iii) that requested inclusion, and (iv) that need the \nseminar  as  a  result  of  analyses  undertaken  during  project  review  missions.  The  target \nparticipants are project managers and middle-level project staff. The seminars will be flexible in \nterms of modules and size of participation, as well as the time schedule. Subject to midyear and \nyear-end  reviews,  the  country  seminars  are  expected  to  be  held  in  Cambodia,  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan. \n \n9.  The seminars will be conducted in English, and combine lectures, case studies, group \ndiscussions,  workshops,  and  practical  exercises.  They  will  address  the  responsibilities  of \nmanagers and other key project officials in project implementation, including pre-implementation \nactivities  of  project  packaging  and  procurement  planning,  start-up  activities  of  consultant \nselection and procurement, and the critical implementation concern of disbursement. The scope \nand content will include discussion of issues and situations that arise in relation to these \nactivities, as well as good practices in evaluation methods and decision making. The case \nstudies will analyze problem situations and the decision-making process. The class exercises \nwill test and reinforce the participants' abilities to apply implementation tools and techniques in \nrelation to the types of projects assisted by ADB.  Quizzes and short tests will be incorporated \ninto the programs. \n \n ", "  3\n10.  The subregional and regional seminars will follow the same format and schedule as the \ncountry seminars, but may offer additional presentations to the extent that ADB headquarters \nand resident mission (RM) staff resources are available. The regional seminar will also take \nfrom 6 to 9 days, and newly appointed project directors and senior policy makers of central \nagencies will form the target group.  \n \n11.  The major risk that will continue to be faced by the program is the retention of the trained \nstaff in the PIUs, as it is not unusual for these trained officials to be placed in more senior \nadministrative duties after initial success in their technical duties. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.   The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent, which will support the \nnine country seminars, and the regional and subregional seminars. The detailed cost estimates \nare shown in Appendix 2. The RETA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Central Operations Services Office (COSO) will be responsible for implementing the \nRETA. Nominations for participation will be solicited from ADB\u2019s regional departments (RDs) \nand RMs. A list of ADB-recommended nominees will then be submitted to the governments for \nconsideration  and  endorsement.  Acceptance  of  additional  nominations  proposed  by  the \ngovernments will be subject to confirmation by ADB. \n \n14.  Apart  from  identifying  the  participants,  RMs  will  provide assistance in  selecting  the \nvenue  and  negotiating  contractual  terms  for  use  of  the  selected  venue.  By  opening  the \nseminars, RMs and the guest officials from the counterpart government agencies also can guide \nthe ADB resource persons to any particular emphasis among the seminar topics that should be \ntaken, to the extent possible. Counterpart government agencies or RMs/RDs may also request \nspecial topics to be inserted into the seminar schedule such as a discussion on the national \nprocurement  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures.  A  typical  seminar  program  is  shown  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n15.  Invitations will be extended to project directors and managers and to other key staff from \nthe EAs of ADB-assisted projects, particularly those at the inception stage. Participation of \nselected policy makers from central agencies involved in formulating financial and procurement \nregulations will be encouraged. About 30 to 40 participants for each seminar will be selected. \nRETA activities are expected to start in the third quarter of 2007 and be completed by the \nsecond quarter of 2009. The resource persons for the country and regional seminars will be \nfrom ADB, particularly procurement specialists from COSO and financial control specialists from \nthe Controller\u2019s Department. Specialists from other departments may be invited for special \ntopics, e.g., the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) for an anticorruption module.  \n \n16.  A no-objection letter will be obtained prior to starting or financing the RETA activities in \nthe territory of the participating DMCs. Postseminar feedback from participants and resource \npersons will be provided to the DMCs through the RMs.  \n \n \n ", "4   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Seminars on Capacity Building for Project Implementation and Administration for 2007\u2013\n2009, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1             5 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance   Data Sources/  Assumptions and Risks \nReporting Mechanisms \nTargets/ Indicators \nImpact  Assumption \n   \n\u2022  DMC project portfolio is  \u2022  Projects-at-risk portfolio  \u2022  Reports of country  \u2022  Participants apply \nmanaged efficiently and  portfolio review  concepts, policies, \nindicator reduced by 5% 1 \neffectively  missions   procedures, and \nyear after the conduct \u2013\nguidelines to ongoing \nfollowing the seminar \u2013 of  \u2022  Updating of the PMIS \nprojects. \nconsultant  selection, \n \n \nprocurement or \ndisbursements, for 75% of \ncountry portfolios involving \nthe participating projects \nOutcome      Assumption \n\u2022  EA and PIU staff of DMCs  \u2022  The contracts-commitments  \u2022  Project performance  \u2022  Project officers from \nhave developed proficiency in  ratio and the disbursement  reports   RDs/RMs help secure \nproject implementation and  ratio of projects benefiting  data to be used for \nadministration following ADB  from the seminars are  \u2022  Updating of the PMIS  monitoring. \npolicies and procedures.   better than country  \u2022  Country procurement   \naverages based on a  assessment reports  Risks \n \nrandom sample of 10% of \n  participants 1 year after    \u2022  Trained personnel are \ncompletion of the seminar.  not retained in their \n  positions in the \n \nexecuting agencies. \n\u2022  Factors affecting \nproject \nimplementation, other \nthan actions by the \ntrained project staff, do \nnot remain the same \nwithin 1 year from \ntraining. \n \nOutputs    Assumptions \n \n\u2022  Tailored CPIA seminars in  \u2022  Up to nine CPIA seminars  \u2022  Seminar attendance  \u2022  Participants are \n(tentative list) Cambodia,  are delivered.  records and BTOR  involved in \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China,  procurement, including \n   \nIndia, Indonesia, Nepal,  planning and \nPakistan, , Philippines, Sri      preparation of bid \nLanka, and Uzbekistan     documents and bid \n  evaluation reports. \n\u2022  Tailored RPIA seminars in  \u2022  Up to three RPIA seminars \nADB headquarters, in Pacific  are delivered.    \u2022  Number of participants \n     is adequate. \nregion, and in CAR   \n\u2022  75% or more of  \u2022  Seminar completion   \n\u2022  Tools conveyed to develop \nproficiency of executing  participants rate the  questionnaire  Risk \nseminar topics totally   \nagency personnel in selecting \nrelevant or mostly relevant  \u2022  Personnel from DMC \nconsultants, procuring goods  to their work.
