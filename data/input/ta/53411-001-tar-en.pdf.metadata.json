INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the transport and trade \nfacilitation  initiatives  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  and  in  particular  the \nimplementation  of  the  GMS  Cross-Border  Transport  Facilitation  Agreement  (CBTA),  by  \n(i) providing assistance to implement the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the \u201cEarly \nHarvest\u201d permit under the CBTA;1 (ii) enhancing the capacity of the private sector to participate \nin the liberalization of transport services; and (iii) strengthening the institutional mechanisms that \nsupport the CBTA. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) prepared the TA in response to requests from the \nGMS countries for continued ADB support to the CBTA.2 The TA is included in the country \noperations  business  plans  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  \n2020\u20132022 and Thailand, 2020\u20132022.3 In addition, the TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nOperational Plan for Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The CBTA was initiated by the six GMS countries\u2014Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014in recognition of the need to \nmatch the large-scale investments in physical infrastructure (i.e., road transport hardware) in the \nGMS with investments in cross-border cooperation and regulation (i.e., the related software) to \nbetter reap the benefits of cross-border trade, transport, and connectivity. To enhance the GMS\u2019s \ncompetitive edge, the CBTA formulated policies and rules to foster a more efficient cross-border \nmovements of people, good, and services, which also promote improved compliance with relevant \nnational laws and regulations. \n \n4.  With the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the GMS countries\u2019 initial \nreactions were to close most of the borders to reduce the spread of the virus across borders. With \nthe pandemic\u2019s negative impact on the economies of the GMS countries, however, transport and \ntrade facilitation have become more important and critical than ever in order to avoid logistics \nobstacles that lead to shortages of necessary supplies. To reopen borders safely, new border \nmeasures were introduced, which have led to delays in release of goods. Under the \u201cnew normal\u201d \nof transport and trade facilitation, the GMS countries need to build the capacity of border agencies \nand adopt a systematic notification procedure to facilitate implementation of these new border \nmeasures (including closing and/or reopening). Conducting dialogue with transport operators on \nnew border measures and safety requirements is also needed to support business continuity and \nfacilitate safe cross-border trade. \n \n5.  The CBTA aims to overcome the logistical obstacles to facilitate transport and trade \nmovement, but the agreement, conceived in 1999 and fully ratified at the end of 2015, requires \n \n1  The \u201cEarly Harvest\u201d permits are permits issued under the Memorandum of Understanding on the \u201cEarly Harvest\u201d \nImplementation of the Cross-Border Transport Facilitation Agreement (CBTA) signed by all GMS Countries in 2017 \nand 2018. \n2  The GMS countries are Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n3  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 2020\uf02d2022. Manila; and ADB. \n2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Thailand, 2020\uf02d2022. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 July 2020. \n4  ADB. 2019. Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration. Manila. \n ", " \n2 \nupdating to be consistent and at par with the current international best practices.5 Recognizing \nthe shortcomings, the GMS countries signed the Early Harvest MOU at the Sixth Joint Committee \nMeeting of the CBTA held on 15 March 2018. Myanmar was given a grace period and will join the \nGMS-wide agreement on 1 June 2021. In the interim, Myanmar will implement the CBTA \narrangements on a bilateral basis with its immediate geographical neighbors: the Lao PDR, the \nPRC, and Thailand. \n \n6.  The implementation of the Early Harvest MOU is now at a critical juncture, with the GMS \ncountries enacting new legislation and starting to issue GMS road transport permits. While the \nuse of the Early Harvest permits is still limited because of operational issues, governments need \nto assist the private sector to maximize the use and benefits of the Early Harvest MOU.6 Options \nto build private sector capacity include, among others, greater consolidation within the freight \ntransport and freight forwarding sectors and encouraging foreign transport operators to expand \nstrategic partnerships or joint ventures with the GMS private sectors. Implementation of the Early \nHarvest  MOU  will  also  explore  measures  to facilitate  safe  cross-border trade  and  support \nbusiness continuity for the transport operators in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n7.  Institutional frameworks under the CBTA also require further support. The institutional \narrangements under the CBTA comprise a CBTA joint committee at the (transport) ministerial \nlevel, supported by the National Transport Facilitation Committee (NTFC) of each GMS country. \nFour  subcommittees  were  also  established:  (i)  transport,  (ii) customs,  (iii)  sanitary  and \nphytosanitary, and (iv) immigration. With the ratification of the CBTA in late 2015 and signing of \nthe Early Harvest MOU, the GMS transport ministers have been meeting biannually to monitor \nthe implementation of the Early Harvest MOU. To achieve the agenda, the CBTA requires a \ncapable institutional framework to strengthen the coordination between and among institutions at \nthe local, national, and GMS levels. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: intermodal links, transport facilitation, logistics \ndevelopment, road safety, and asset management promoted.7 The impact is also linked to ADB\u2019s \nOperational Plan for Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2019\u20132024 \n(footnote 4) which focuses on (i) greater and higher quality connectivity between economies, and \n \n(ii) expanded global and regional trade and investment opportunity.The TA will have the following \noutcome: liberalization of traffic rights in the GMS increased.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA has three outputs: (i) implementation of the Early Harvest CBTA supported;  \n(ii) capacity of the transport operators to participate in a liberalized transport sector enhanced; \nand (iii) GMS CBTA institutional mechanisms strengthened. The TA will build on the outputs \nproduced by a TA completed in June 2019 that helped implement a transport and trade facilitation \n \n5  The negotiation on the main text of the CBTA was concluded in November 1999. The negotiations on its annexes \nand protocols were conducted from 2003 to 2005. \n6  Operational issues as reported by the Mekong Institute in their monitoring and evaluation report include, among \nothers, lack of awareness of border officials on the Early Harvest arrangement and the lack of opportunities for \ntransport operators to meet with potential partners in other GMS countries.  \n7  ADB. 2018. The Ha Noi Action Plan, 2018\u20132022. Manila. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", " \n3 \nprogram in the GMS.9  \n \n10.  Output 1: Implementation of the Early Harvest Cross-Border Transport Facilitation \nAgreement supported. The TA will support (i) the development of interim customs transit \narrangements pending adoption of CBTA 2.0; (ii) the continuous monitoring of the implementation \nof the Early Harvest CBTA, including any issues that may arise; (iii) the integration of Myanmar \ninto the GMS-wide Early Harvest MOU; and (iv) the negotiation of the CBTA 2.0.10 The negotiation \nof the CBTA 2.0 will build on revised draft texts that are based on the CBTA review submitted to \nthe GMS transport ministers at the Fifth Joint Committee Meeting in 2017.11 The TA will also \nsupport COVID-19-related measures, such as increasing the number of border agencies using \nenhanced risk management and handling of emergency relief consignments in accordance with \ninternational standards set by World Customs Organization. It will also consider lessons from \nCOVID-19-related measures under the Early Harvest implementation to provide guidance on \nincluding provisions to address future possible pandemics, such as notification procedures. To \nfoster trade facilitation in the GMS more broadly, ADB will implement the TA in close coordination \nwith other trade facilitation-related TA in ADB.12 \n \n11.  Output 2: Capacity of the transport operators to participate in a liberalized transport \nsector enhanced. The TA will support the private sector by enhancing its capacity to reap the \nbenefits of liberalized transport services under the Early Harvest MOU and the full implementation \nof the CBTA 2.0. These capacity-building initiatives include creating a network of Early Harvest \npermit holders to promote joint marketing and transport operations, training local transport \noperators to qualify for international cross-border transport licenses, and other related activities. \nAlso, the TA will engage with leading transport and logistics service providers, including through \ntheir representative associations, to encourage permit use and to enhance the capacity of local \ntransport operators. During the COVID-19 pandemic, activities may use remote video technology, \nsuch as online training and webinars as necessary. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Cross-Border  Transport  Facilitation \nAgreement institutional mechanisms strengthened. The CBTA Joint Committee, comprising \nthe GMS Transport Ministers expect that NTFC subcommittees will participate more strongly as \nimplementation  of  the  Early  Harvest  CBTA  advances.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  CBTA\u2019s \ninstitutional setup to facilitate and encourage subcommittee participation in deliberating measures \nto address issues in implementing the Early Harvest CBTA. The institutional setup of the CBTA \nalso needs to be better linked to the broader GMS structures in order for the CBTA to make a \ngreater contribution to the GMS Strategy 2030.13 The TA will continuously review the current \nstructures of CBTA and their linkages to the broader GMS structures and support the CBTA \nsecretariat within ADB and the GMS countries. \n \n \n \n9  ADB. 2014.

The TA was closed on 30 June 2019. \n10 The CBTA 2.0 will be an updated CBTA comprising revised provisions to be in line with current international and \nregional best practices as well as business models of transport operators. \n11 The revised texts of the CBTA include the main agreement and its 20 annexes and protocols. The revisions also \nidentified outdated texts that need to be aligned with the current best practices or that would benefit from streamlining \nand simplification. \n12 ADB. 2017.

The GMS Strategy 2030 is expected to be endorsed at the next GMS \nsummit in March 2021. The TA may provide an opportunity to prepare the groundwork for the establishment of a \ntrade facilitation and investment facilitation working group proposed under GMS Strategy 2030. \n ", " \n4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUnited Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.14 The key expenditure \nitems are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division, \nSoutheast Asia Department will implement the TA in consultation with the Southeast Asia \nDepartment\u2019s resident missions and sector divisions, as well as with the East Asia Department. \nThe project team will monitor TA implementation in coordination with the respective NTFC \nsecretariat of the GMS member countries.

Individual consultants would provide flexibility to \nselect experts who would be well accepted by most if not all of the six countries. \n17 The Mekong Institute is an intergovernmental organization run by six governments in the GMS: Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, Myanmar, the PRC, Thailand, and Viet Nam. ADB serves as one of the council members. The Mekong Institute \ndelivers various programs and activities that focus on human resource development and capacity building for regional \ncooperation and integration. As an organization affiliated with GMS and an impartial entity, the Mekong Institute has \nbeen assigned by the GMS transport ministers to monitor and evaluate the Early Harvest implementation of the \nCBTA. The ministers have requested the Mekong Institute to continue the task. \n ", " \n5 \nADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  staff \ninstructions.

During implementation, the TA team will provide semiannual \nprogress reports to the United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity under the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility, including an overview of \nexpenditures. Eligible activities for financing include the cost of expert services and related \nfacilities  required  for  the  TA  or  related  operational  activities  (including  staff  training  and \ndevelopment for eligible developing member countries) to be carried out by ADB. ADB will discuss \nany major changes in the TA scope and objectives with the United Kingdom Fund for Asia \nRegional Trade and Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnerships Facility. ADB will also share the TA completion report with the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  administering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$1,500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade \nand Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility \nfor \u201cEarly Harvest\u201d Implementation of the Cross-Border Transport and Trade Facilitation in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " \n6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nIntermodal links, transport facilitation, logistics development, road safety and asset management \npromoted (GMS Ha Noi Action Plan 2018\u20132022)a \n    Performance Indicators with     \n  Targets and Baselines  Data Sources and   \nResults Chain  Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nOutcome:  By 2022:     \nLiberalization of  Utilization of \u201cEarly Harvest\u201db  M&E reports of the  Delays in decision \ntraffic rights in the  permits by at least 20 transport  Early Harvest CBTA  making by GMS \nGMS increased  operators.
