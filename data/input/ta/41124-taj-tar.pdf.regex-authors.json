Since independence Tajikistan has been implementing reforms that included eliminating \nprice controls, lifting tariff barriers, and privatizing small enterprises. These efforts together with \nthe end of civil conflict, macroeconomic recovery, and strong remittances contributed to  strong \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth (about 9% average per annum during 2001\u20132006), with \nmodest inflation and a stable exchange rate. The Government is now embarking on a more \ncomprehensive  reform  program  that  includes  reforming  state  institutions  and  public \nadministration, and private sector development (PSD). In March 2006, the Government adopted \nthe Public Administration Reform Strategy.     \n \n2.  The Government, with the help of the Donor Coordination Council, developed the Private \nSector Development Strategy (PSDS) in 2006. The PSDS is aimed at improving government \npolicies and laws that are the greatest impediment to investment and PSD. The PSDS consists \nof four elements: (i) reducing risk and uncertainty for the potential investor or entrepreneur, (ii) \nremoving  barriers  that  actually  prevent  entry,  (iii)  reducing  the  cost  of  doing  business  in \nTajikistan including entry and exit costs, and (iv) supporting the private sector to increase \nproductivity and human capacity to drive growth. \n \n3.  The Government established the State Committee on Investments and State Property \nManagement  (SCISPM)  during  structural  reorganization  of  the  government  in  late  2006. \nSupporting development of the private sector and attraction of foreign direct investments are \namong the key functions of SCISPM, enabling it to potentially play a major role in implementing \nthe PSDS. However, the institutional capacity of SCISPM in fulfilling its responsibilities is weak \nand requires major technical assistance. \n \n4.  In 2006, the Government requested aid agencies to provide assistance for implementing \nthe PSDS. Accordingly, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) fielded its Fact-Finding Mission1 \nfrom 30 April to 10 May; that led to an understanding with the Government on the impact, \noutcomes,  outputs,  approach,  cost  estimates,  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of \nreference  of  the  technical  assistance  Implementation  Support  for  the  Private  Sector \nDevelopment Strategy in Tajikistan (TA).2 The Department for International Development (DFID) \nof the United Kingdom would cofinance the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  The design of the TA has been closely coordinated with the planned assistance of \nother development partners, especially the European Commission (EC) and the World Bank \n(WB)  group.    The  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  facilitated \nMission consultations with the private sector and commercial banks and contributed to the \ndesign of the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Tajikistan ranks 133 out of 175 countries in the WB\u2019s Doing Business in 2006.3 The \nprivate sector\u2019s share in GDP grew slightly to 43% in 2005 from 40% in 2004, but still remains \nlow by international or even regional standards. Unfavorable investment climate is increasingly \n                                                 \n1 The Mission comprised Zafardjon Khotamov, Economics Officer, TJRM (mission leader); and Neeraj Jain, CD, \nTJRM, (mission member). ADB also invited representatives of other aid agencies to join the Mission: Valsa Shah, \nEconomist, DfID; Etta Gaskell, Head of Office, DfID; Zainiddin Karaev, Program Officer, DfID; Barbara Plinkert, EC; \nFrederik Coene, Project Manager, EC; Gary Fine, Senior Private Sector Development Specialist, WB; and Firuz \nKataev, Consultant, WB.  \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities website on 1 June 2007. \n3 See Doing Business at http://www.doingbusiness.org/. \n ", "2   \nbecoming a binding constraint to sustainable economic growth. In response, the Government \nhas identified PSD as a strategic development priority for Tajikistan. The Poverty Reduction \nStrategy for 2007\u20132009 aims at increasing the share of the private sector to 55% by 2009.      \n \n6.  Increased  growth  of  small  producers  was  recorded  in  recent  years.  Growth  was \nparticularly strong in the traditional \"small business\"4 areas like construction, retail trade, and \ncatering. There are, however, numerous obstacles to stronger growth and greater dynamism of \nthe private sector. They include (i) the Government\u2019s insufficient understanding of its role as an \n\u201cenabler\u201d of the PSD, (ii) multiple and often ill-designed registration and inspection requirements, \n(iii) an inadequate legal framework and the judicial system, (iv) weak public administration; (v) \nweak infrastructure  particularly in energy and transport, and (vi) an underdeveloped financial \nsystem. Lack of profitable investment opportunities due to the small size of the economy5 and \nlimited physical access to export markets also constrain private sector development in Tajikistan. \nImprovements in transport infrastructure and cross-border trading arrangements would help \nalleviate these constraints in the long term. In the interim, industry-level solutions could be found \nthrough better quality information on markets and technology. \n       \n7.  SCISPM staff has been drawn largely from the previous State Agency for Antimonopoly, \nAid  Coordination  Unit  under  the  President\u2019s  Office  and  the  State  Property  Management \nCommittee.  SCISPM  also  recruited  professionals  from  National  Social  Investment  Fund  of \nTajikistan and other aid-funded projects. The management of SCISPM consists of a team of \nexperienced government officials drawn from  various government institutions, including the \ncentral  bank  and  former  ministry  of  economy  and  trade.  A  quick  capacity  assessment  of \nSCISPM in Supplementary Appendix A suggests a need for review of its regulation (charter) \nand organizational structure, and for building the capacity of its staff to shift the focus from \ncontrol  of  the  private  sector  to  providing  an  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector. \nLegislative and policy reforms to improve the climate for the PSD are urgently needed. The \ncapacity of SCISPM to coordinate the drafting of relevant legislation and its approval needs \nbuilding up.    \n \n8.  In  the  initial  stages  of  PSD,  institutional  strengthening  of  business  promotion  and \nadvisory services strongly complements policy reforms for an enabling environment. Modern \nbusiness education is absent in Tajikistan and significant support and advisory services are \nrequired for the private sector to attract financing and develop. For example, commercial banks \nin Tajikistan avoid long-term lending to the private sector and when they do lend for the short \nterm, they tend to demand high levels of collateral. Therefore, there is a strong need to create \nsome success stories of enterprises that demonstrate improved operational, marketing, and \nfinancial results to make Tajik enterprises attractive as an investment class and provide an \nincentive for banks and potential investors to increase lending to this sector.  \n \n9.  PSD is a key operational priority of ADB and is one of the three crosscutting themes of \nthe  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (2001\u20132015).  For \nsustaining  high  growth,  employment  creation,  and  rising  production,  the  Private  Sector \nDevelopment Strategy of ADB operationalizes the Bank\u2019s strategies and visions through three \nmain thrusts: (i) help governments of the developing member countries to create enabling \nconditions  for  PSD,  (ii)  generate  private  sector  investment  opportunities,  and  (iii)  catalyze \nprivate investment. The proposed TA will address the first and third pillars of PSD.       \n                                                 \n4 Tajik statistical authorities generally classify industrial and construction firms with less than 50 employees as \n\"small\". \n5 The domestic market is fragmented due to geographical reasons exacerbating economy of scale difficulties. \n ", "  3\n \n10.  With its sector expertise and multilateral structure, ADB can serve as an effective partner \nfor the Government in initiating, implementing, and coordinating PSD-related analysis, policy \ndialogue, capacity development, and reform  design and implementation, toward supporting \nprivate sector-led growth. The translation of the PSDS matrix into actions must be facilitated \nthrough continuous engagement and dialogue, and effective change management. At the same \ntime the private sector must be engaged with a view to select and nurture a limited number of \nmost promising businesses. The TA can better achieve its outcomes by supporting reform \nchampions and creating demonstration effects.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA aims to improve the capacity of the Government in promoting PSD. The main \nintended outcomes of the TA are (i) the Government\u2019s understanding  of its role as an \u201cenabler\u201d \nof the private sector, (ii) effective engagement and active leadership of the Government in \nsimplifying  business  regulations  and  creating  a  favorable  environment  for  PSD,  and  (iii) \nmainstreaming  and  strengthening  of  business  promotion  and  advisory  services  by  the \nGovernment.  \n \n12.  The expected outputs of the TA include (i) policy advice including that for coordination of \nPSDS implementation, (ii) assessment and development of the Government\u2019s capacity for PSD, \nand (iii) development of a concept of investment and business promotion for Tajikistan and \nbusiness advisory assistance to a few businesses for demonstration purposes. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Implementation of the TA would be closely coordinated with the planned support of other \ndevelopment assistance partners. DfID, which is cofinancing the TA, would also be involved \nduring TA implementation. A working group comprising SCISPM and development partners (the \nworking group) would be set up to oversee the management of external assistance, including \nthat for the TA for PSDS implementation. The TA will assist the Government to lead aid \ncoordination in PSD through the proposed working group.  \n \n14.  The TA will have three tasks. A more detailed set of activities under each task are in \nAppendix 1. The set of activities will be further refined in a participatory manner in consultation \nwith the working group during the 3-month inception phase.  \n   \n  1.  Policy Advice and Coordination for PSD Strategy Implementation \n \n15.  This task would entail providing expert advice to SCISPM on implementing the PSDS, \ncoordinating government and development partner support for PSD, and identifying resource \ngaps and helping SCISPM address those gaps.   \n \n  2.  Capacity Building \n \n16.  Capacity building will be at two levels, namely, institutional and human development. It \nshould result in (i) creating robust mechanisms for implementing the PSDS, and (ii) building in \ndifferent government institutions a greater awareness of the government's role in PSD. Building \nindividual and institutional capabilities of SCISPM, including through reorganization, to fulfill its \n ", "4   \nmandate to support PSD, will be an important part of this task. This component will complement \nand build on relevant capacity-building activities assisted by other development partners. \n \n  3.  Business Development and Investment Promotion Support \n \n17.  This task would lead to the development and implementation of a business development \nand  investment  promotion  concept,  taking  into  account  the  relevant  experience  of  other \ncountries, principles of market economy and transparency, and the importance of avoiding the \ncreation of additional bureaucratic structures.     \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The estimated TA cost is $2,000,000 equivalent, of which $900,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government of the United Kingdom has agreed \nto contribute $1,000,000 equivalent on a grant basis. ADB will administer the contribution from \nthe  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom.  The  Government  of  Tajikistan  will  contribute  the \nbalance of $100,000 equivalent in kind by providing office accommodation, and remuneration \nand per diem of counterpart government staff. The TA costs and the financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  SCISPM will be the Executing Agency of the TA under the overall coordination of the \nPresident\u2019s Office of Tajikistan. The TA will be implemented by a team of individual national and \ninternational  consultants.  The  input  will  comprise  54  person-months  of  international  and \n72 person-months of national consulting services. Outline terms of reference for the consultants \nare in Appendix 3. ADB will engage the consultants (both national and international) on an \nindividual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The consultants will be located at SCISPM. Equipment under the TA will be \nprocured by ADB in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and will be transferred to SCISPM upon completion of the TA. The TA is estimated to \nstart in October 2007 and be completed in October 2010.  \n \nE.  Monitoring and Reporting  \n20.  The consultants will submit to ADB, SCISPM, and the working group an inception report \nat the end of the 3-month inception phase. The inception report will  \n(i) include a detailed work plan for the project team and the implementation plan of the \nTA;  \n(ii) assess the current capacity of SCISPM in relation to its mandate to support PSD; \n(iii)  identify  key  success  factors  supported  by  the  TA,  including  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation plan; and  \n(iv)develop  a  strategy  for  communicating  and  coordinating  TA  implementation  with \nrelated activities of other development partners and government agencies.   \n \n21.  Thereafter, the consultants will submit to ADB, SCISPM, and the working group progress \nreports every 6 months and a final report on the activities, outputs, and results of all TA tasks. \nThe second 6-month report will include a detailed action plan for implementing the PSDS, \nincluding a set of quantitative and qualitative performance indicators of SCISPM\u2019s progress in \nimplementing the strategy. \n  \n ", "  5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of \nTajikistan for Implementation Support for Private Sector Development Strategy in Tajikistan, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact       Assumptions \n       \nIncreased  Increased private sector  Economic and  Achieving these \ncontribution of the  share of GDP from 43% in  country reports   outcomes requires:  \nprivate sector to  2005 to 55% in 2009    \u2022 political will to \neconomic growth     (Government,  implement PSDS, \n    ADB/IMF/World  commitment to \n  Bank)  undertake reforms at \n  both  central and \nADB review missions  oblast levels \n\u2022 promising enterprises \nability and desire to \nlearn doing business \nin a competitive \nenvironment \n \nRisk \n\u2022  Slow pace of reform \nimplementation \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nImproved capacity of  The management and core  Final and progress  Achieving these \nthe Government in  staff of SCISPM  apply  reports under the TA  outcomes requires  \npromoting PSD  best practices in creating    \u2022 stability in \n   an enabling environment  PSA updates and  Government, \n   for PSD and in business  other business and  including in SCISPM \nand investment promotion  government surveys  \u2022 continuous \nby 2010       commitment and \n  ADB CPS, CPA, and  political support of \nAdoption and  other country  the Government in \nimplementation of policies,  economic reports   relation to PSD- \nlaws, regulations for PSD    promoting activities of \nenabling environment by  Doing Business  SCISPM  \n2010  reports by the World   \n  Bank   Risk \n    \u2022  Loss of institutional \n    memory when the \n  trained staff leave \n  post \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7\n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
