INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following the sharp increase in the prices of rice and other foods in 2007 and 2008, food \nsecurity became a major concern among the members of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN).1 Rice is the food staple and the major source of livelihood for most of the \nrural residents of Southeast Asia. In March 2009, ASEAN members adopted a regional food \nsecurity initiative called the ASEAN Integrated Food Security (AIFS) and the Strategic Plan of \nAction for Food Security (SPA-FS).2 \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) is in response to the request by the minister of agriculture \nand cooperatives of the Government of Thailand for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help \nASEAN implement the AIFS and SPA-FS. The TA design benefited from consultations and \ndiscussions  with  ASEAN  members  and  the  ASEAN  Secretariat.  ADB\u2019s  collaboration  with \nASEAN can contribute greatly to attaining food security within and beyond the ASEAN region.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  More ASEAN rice trade. The rice price crises in 2007 and 2008 demonstrated the \nvulnerability of the rice market within the ASEAN region. This vulnerability largely reflects the \nthin global market for rice. Historically, only about 5%\u20137% of worldwide rice production has \nbeen traded, compared to 20% for wheat and 13% for maize. Rice trade among ASEAN \nmembers generally plays a minor role as their domestic needs are met mainly by government-\nrun self-sufficiency and buffer stock programs. ASEAN members responded to the global rice \nprice  crisis  with  government-to-government  trade  and  trade  restrictions  that  entailed  huge \ntransactions costs and fueled additional volatility in rice prices. Open rice trade needs to be \nencouraged as a vehicle for stabilizing food prices and ensuring access.4 However, because \nmany ASEAN members regard rice as a political, rather than an economic, commodity, building \nconfidence in trade as a vehicle for food security cannot be left to individual economies. A \nregional  body  such  as  ASEAN,  with  its  collective  commitment  to  promoting  initiatives  that \nsupport sustainable food trade under the AIFS and SPA-FS, has an exceptional opportunity to \nestablish regional trust in rice trade.    \n \n4.  Regional reserve system. While open rice trade as a vehicle to achieve sustainable \nfood security in the region may be a long-term goal, ASEAN members could address temporary \nrice shortages during emergency situations5 through the management of a regional buffer stock. \n                                                 \n1  The ASEAN countries comprise Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, \nMalaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. ASEAN + 3 also includes Japan, People's \nRepublic of China, and Republic of Korea.  \n2  During the 14th ASEAN Summit that was held in Cha-am, Thailand on March 2009, the ASEAN Heads of State \nadopted the AIFS and the SPA-FS. Following the 1996 World Food Summit, the ASEAN defined food security as a \nsituation \u201cwhen all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food to \nmeet their dietary needs and food preferences for a healthy and active life.\u201d The statement of the Heads of State of \nthe ASEAN  in support of food security in the region is in http://www.14thaseansummit.org/pdf/Outcome_Document \n/Statement%20on%20Food%20Security%5B1%5D.pdf. The complete version of the two documents can be found \nin http://www.aseansec.org/22338.pdf.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 Oct 2009. \n4  During 1999\u20132009, rice price volatility was 1.05, the highest when compared to wheat at 0.91 and to corn at 0.87 \nThfoer  vthieew sasm eex pyreeasr sed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n5m  \"eEmmbeergrse,n Bcyo\" awrdas o df eDfiinreedc taosr sa,  \"Mstaantea ogre cmoendnitt,i oonr  hsatavifnf,g a snudff emready e bxetr epmreel iamnidn aurnye xinp encatetudr ena. t ural or man-induced \ncalamity, which is unable to cope with such state or condition through its national reserve and is unable to procure \nthe needed supply through normal trade\" (ASEAN. 2009. ASEAN Integrated Food Security Framework and \nStrategic Plan of Action on Food Security in the ASEAN Region. Cha-am, Thailand). Additional information on the \nAIFS and SPA-FS is in http://www.aseansec.org/22338.pdf.   \n ", "2   \nThe East Asia Emergency Rice Reserve (EAERR) was launched in March 2004 as a pilot rice \nbuffer stock project. Financed by the Government of Japan, it was to develop the mechanisms \nfor a more permanent reserve system. The EAERR operation has been limited to small-scale \ndisaster relief6 on humanitarian grounds. Its stocks are inadequate to make a difference during \nprice spikes, and the releases require time-consuming bilateral negotiations. Aware of the \nprojected increase in demand for rice, continuing volatility of food prices because of economic \nspeculation, and potential rice supply fluctuations caused by climate change, ASEAN members \nsee the need to expand the regional buffer stock into an ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN+3) \n7emergency  rice  reserve.  Learning  from  the  EAERR  experience,8  ASEAN+3  envisages  a \nreserve that will be used for more than disaster relief, will cover larger volumes of rice to \naugment ASEAN members\u2019 individual national emergency food reserves, and will be more \nfinancially sustainable. During the 31st meeting of the AMAF, the ministers agreed to start the \npreparatory work for the establishment of  the ASEAN Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserve \n(APTERR) after the end of the EAERR pilot project on February 2010. However, knowledge \ngaps remain on the appropriate business model and management structure for this planned \nexpanded regional reserve system. ASEAN+3 also may not be able to perform even a limited \nrole of disaster relief as the EAERR project office's financial support from the Government of \nJapan will end in February 2010.   \n \n5.  Enhanced food security information. ASEAN members require timely, accurate, and \nupdated information on short- and long-term food supply and demand. The data is needed to \nmake sound decisions on food policies and food reserve management to ensure food security, \nparticularly  against  sudden  economic  and  natural  shocks.  The  Government  of  Japan  is \nsupporting an ASEAN initiative, called the ASEAN Food Security Information System (AFSIS), \nwhich is continuing until 2012. The AFSIS depends on data supplied by public agencies of \nASEAN members, and its database and analytical methods are being developed. The utility of \nthe data and analysis has not been validated for a wider range of potential users, such as the \nmanagers of the APTERR, policy makers, rice traders, and farmers. In addition, AFSIS will need \nto collaborate with other food security information systems in the region for efficiency and \nsynergy.  \n \n6.  Gaps and technical assistance proposal. For ASEAN members to move forward in \nimplementing  the  AIFS  and  the  SPA-FS,  the  following  knowledge  gaps  will  need  to  be \naddressed: (i) identifying the appropriate business model and management structure for a \nsustainable  regional  food  reserve  system,  (ii)  developing  the  appropriate  road  map  for \npromoting freer trade of rice in the region, and (iii) validating the food security information \nsystem to make sure it is responsive to users. The TA will address these gaps and facilitate \nASEAN+3  in  implementing  the  most  crucial  elements  of  the  SPA-FS:  (i)  developing  a \nsustainable regional rice reserve system, (ii) promoting regional rice trade and food market, and \n(iii) broadening the outreach of the food security information system.  \n  \n                                                 \n6  During 2008\u20132009, the EAERR delivered about 2,100 tons of rice for floods and other disasters in Cambodia, \nIndonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines.   \n7  ASEAN +3 also includes Japan, People's Republic of China, and Republic of Korea. \n8  The  experience  of  the  South  Asian  Food  Bank  is  similar  to  that  of  the  EAERR  in  terms  of  low  reserve \ncommitments, bureaucratic procedures, and weak financial sustainability.  \n ", "      3 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be improved availability of and sustainable access to adequate rice for \npoor and vulnerable households in ASEAN countries (Appendix 1). The outcome will be more \nregional cooperation in the rice market among ASEAN+3 countries.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  To achieve the outcome, the TA will deliver three outputs: (i) ASEAN authorities agree \non  the  business  plan  and  management  structure  for  the  APTERR  and  their  implementing \nguidelines; (ii) ASEAN authorities agree on the strategy and medium-term action plan, including \nthe implementing rules and regulations, for expanded and stable rice trade in the region that \nfully complies with the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA); and (iii) AFSIS outreach is \nbroadened. For outputs (i) and (iii), ADB will provide assistance in collaboration with the ongoing \nsupport of the Government of Japan for EAERR, APTERR, and AFSIS. \n   \n9.  For the first output, an analytical assessment will be conducted to (i) review EAERR \noperations and international best practice on regional reserves; (ii) provide indicative options for \na sustainable APTERR business model, including the management structure and financing \narrangement for a least-cost, effective, and efficient reserve; and (iii) determine the appropriate \ncoordination with other emergency support systems, such as that of the World Food Program. \nOperational  guidelines  for  implementation  will  also  be  prepared  in  support  of  the \nrecommendations  for  a  sustainable  APTERR.  The  recommendations  will  be  forwarded  to \nASEAN+3 authorities for their review and decision. The TA will cover the operational costs of \nthe EAERR project office during preparations for the establishment of the more permanent \nAPTERR. \n \n10.  For the second output, the factors contributing to the low level of rice trade in the region, \nsuch as trade and trade-related policies, transaction costs, and private sector participation, will \nbe analyzed.9 Challenges and opportunities for strengthening the rice market will be identified in \na major exporting and major importing country, and the process of rice price formation will be \nexamined. The implementation of the ATIGA provisions on rice trade will be reviewed and \nimplementation policies, such as sub-agreements elaborating on the relevant ATIGA provisions, \nwill be drafted. These policies will form the strategy and medium-term action plan for expanding \ntrade in the region.  \n \n11.  For the third output, support will focus on areas that are crucial for the efficient and \neffective outreach of the AFSIS network, but are not covered by the technical grant of the \nGovernment of Japan for the AFSIS. Indicative activities will include the validation of the existing \ndatabase from the viewpoints of various users and the conduct of expanded outreach programs \non the AFSIS. Consultative workshops on the findings of the assessment will try to ensure that \nusers, particularly of APTERR, are equipped with proper and timely information and appropriate \nassessment methods for anticipating rice shortages. Recommendations will be provided for \nstrengthening the database, assessment methods, and information system, and for expanding \nits outreach.  \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n m   e m   b  e  r s  ,  B   o a  r d    o  f   D  i r e  c t o  r s  ,   M  a  nagement, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n9  By identifying the contribution of improved supply chain infrastructure in rice to trade, this study will complement the \ncurrent TA of the World Bank on food supply chains in East Asia for ASEAN. \n \n ", "4   \n \n12.  For the three outputs, a participatory and broad-based approach will be used, including \nconsultations in the form of workshops, e-discussions, and focus groups involving major food \nsecurity stakeholders in the region. The consensus-building approach will be jointly undertaken \nwith the concerned government agencies in ASEAN. Collaboration with the World Bank on its \nfood value chain study, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on its work \non food security, and other development partners will be ensured.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $2.3 million. ADB will finance $2.0 million, \nand ASEAN will provide in-kind contributions equivalent to $0.3 million. The financing will be \nprovided on a grant basis by Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. Detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n14.  ADB will finance (i) the engagement of consultants; (ii) technical working group (TWG) \nmeetings, and national and regional multi-stakeholder workshops in ASEAN on issues directly \nrelated to the TA activities and outputs;10 (iii) capacity building of APTERR technical staff on the \nuse and analysis of rice-related supply and demand data; and (iv) operational expenses of the \nAgriculture Industries and Natural Resources Division (AINRD) of the ASEAN Secretariat for the \nholding of the TWG (para. 20) meetings and workshops, and attendance in meetings of TWGs \nand other TA-related activities.  \n \n15.  ADB will also finance the operational expenses of the EAERR from March 2010 to \nFebruary 2011, including salaries of EAERR project management staff, as well as the costs of \nthe emergency relief system, office supplies and communications, conduct of meetings and \nworkshops, and travel. ADB's support for the continued operations of the EAERR project office \nis justified to sustain ASEAN+3's capacity to respond to the emergency food situation. The TA is \nexpected  to  facilitate  the  collective  decision  making  of  the  concerned  authorities  on  the \nstructure, business models, and implementation guidelines for the operation of the APTERR.  \n \n16.  A separate imprest account will be created in AINRD to contain the funds for the EAERR \noperational costs, and the costs of TWG meetings and TA-related expenses of the AIRND. The \nAIRND  will  withdraw  from  the  account  according  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the \nimplementation agreement. The statement of expenditures procedure may be used to reimburse \neligible expenditures of the project and liquidate advances provided into the imprest account. \n \n17.  ASEAN's in-kind contribution of counterpart services and facilities includes the staff time \nof AINRD and ASEAN members, and the office facilities of EAERR and AFSIS for the TA \nconsultants.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA is expected to be implemented from January 2010 to June 2011. ADB, through \nits Regional and Sustainable Development Department \u2013 Agriculture and Rural Development \nUnit (RSDD-AR) will be the executing agency. The ASEAN Secretariat will be the implementing \nagency. As the secretariat is the coordinator of all ASEAN bodies and activities and the clearing \npoint  for  information,  it  is  well-placed  to  ensure  collaboration  among  the  ASEAN  member \n                                                 \n10  Rules and regulations for ADB financing TA-related expenses will apply, including restriction of funding the travel of \nofficials of the countries that are classified as developing member countries (Singapore and Brunei Darussalam).  \n ", "      5 \ngovernments, the additional countries in ASEAN+3, and other stakeholders in ASEAN. The \nsecretariat also has a good track record in working with ADB on TA projects relating to ASEAN.  \n .   \n19.  ADB will recruit the consultants individually in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA project will require 85.5 person-\nmonths of consulting services, comprising 32.5 person-months of international consultants and \n53 person-months of national consultants. Four person-months of international consultants do \nnot have specified expertise requirements in anticipation of food trade-specific issues related to \nthe implementation of ATIGA provisions that will be identified during discussions of the TWG on \ntrade. Individual engagement is justified as the expertise will not be required at the same time. \nThis will enable the engagement of specialized skills and those with proven work experience in \nregional cooperation, particularly with ASEAN operations. Expertise is needed in food security, \ntrade, technical and legal aspects of a sustainable regional reserve system and food trade, \nregional food information, regional organization, and website development. To facilitate the day-\nto-day operations, two regional specialists will be engaged, one to be based in the AINRD office \nin Jakarta and the other in ADB.  \n   \n20.  ADB will execute an implementation agreement with the ASEAN Secretariat, which will \ndesignate the AINRD as its implementer of the TA project. The agreement will state the fund \nflow arrangement, the eligible expenses, responsibilities of the concerned parties, and other \ngeneral provisions. The AINRD will work with the RSDD-AR to (i) facilitate the provision of the \nnecessary information and resources from ASEAN+3 countries for the TA project; (ii) ensure the \nestablishment of the TWGs, as well as coordinate and oversee the TWG meetings and multi-\nstakeholder workshops; and (iii) coordinate the decisions of their authorities on the TA outputs, \nincluding the discussions at the senior officials meeting and the ASEAN ministers on agriculture \nand forestry. Three TWGs will be formed, each responsible for the delivery of one of the TA \noutputs.  The  TWGs  will  oversee  and  make  technical  decisions  on  the  TA  outputs  and \nrecommendations; and facilitate the review and decisions at the senior officials meeting and the \nmeeting of ASEAN ministers on agriculture and forestry, and any other authorities authorized by \nASEAN+3. A detailed work arrangement of the TWG and its membership structure are is \ndiscussed in Appendix 3.  \n \n21.  The AINRD will hold an inception workshop within 2 months after TA approval to firm up \nproject activities and the schedule for each output. A midterm workshop will be held within 9 \nmonths of TA approval and a final workshop within 18 months. The AIRND will submit the \nfollowing  reports  to  ADB:  (i)  an  inception  report,  (ii)  a  midterm  progress  report,  (iii)  the \nproceedings of the TWG meetings and the draft reports of experts for each output, (iv) a final \nreport, (v) semiannual financial statements accounting for the use of funds, and (v) an audited \nannual financial statement. The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the performance \nindicators outlined in Appendix 1 and through the timely submission of reports following on-site \nconsultations and training. Performance will also be assessed during TA review missions. Good \npractices  and  lessons  will  be  disseminated  through  the  agriculture  community  of  practice \nwebsite, and shared with other development partners.  \n \nIV.
