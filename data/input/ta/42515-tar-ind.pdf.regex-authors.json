INTRODUCTION \n1.  Aligned with the Government of India\u2019s development objectives, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has put the less developed and weak states in India at the main focus of its \nstrategy  and  program,  including  financial  support  to  infrastructure  investment  and  capacity \ndevelopment  activities  in  urban  development,  roads  and  highways,  water  resources \nmanagement,  public  resource  management,  and  energy  sectors.  One  investment  program \nunder the multitranche financing facility1 in the urban development sector was approved in 2009 \nand the first tranche project2 is now under implementation in five states\u2014Tripura, Mizoram, \nSikkim, Nagaland, and Meghalaya. The second tranche of the investment program may be \nprocessed in 2011. New projects in the transport sector3 and water resources4 sectors are \nprogrammed for processing and approval in 2010. \n \n2.  Recognizing that the capacity in project preparation and project implementation in the \nless developed states is low, capacity development technical assistance (TA)5 was included in \nADB\u2019s 2009 country operations business plan for India,6 with the key objective of supporting the \nimplementation of ADB operations in those states. Following a discussion with the government \nin October 2009, consensus was reached in principle, on the purpose, scope, implementation \narrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. The concept for this TA was approved by \nADB Management on 13 October 2009. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  government\u2019s  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan,  2007\u20132012,7 outlines  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment strategy that includes the reduction in interstate disparities. It seeks to redress \ninterstate divides in economic and social indicators by proposing various instruments (including \nfiscal  incentives  for  lagging  regions,  industrial  policies,  and  directly  targeted  programs)  to \nachieve this objective. ADB has long experience in assisting the lagging states. Since 2003, \nADB has initiated operations in Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Orissa, and \nUttarakhand. While ADB has responded to the government\u2019s evolving needs, the challenges of \ndesigning and implementing operations in the states with weak capacity and little familiarity with \nADB are enormous. ADB\u2019s experience since 2003 has shown that it takes much longer than \ninitially anticipated to design and implement investment projects in those states. Building up \ngood communication channels with officials of new state governments and executing agencies, \nand familiarizing them with ADB policies and procedures, takes time. Despite these challenges, \nADB remains committed to engaging with states with weak capacity. Adequate staff and TA \nresources need to be provided for capacity building during processing and implementation. \n \n4.  The involvement of international development agencies has been very limited in the \nlagging states, and experience in the development and implementation of large schemes has \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

Most of the concerned government \nagencies in those states have prepared detailed designs only for a few major projects, and \nsupervise construction with their own staff. Implementation of projects in those weak states is \nfurther complicated by limited availability of local contractors, generally not exposed to large-\nscale civil works contracts. \n \n5.  Lessons drawn from the implementation of ADB-funded projects in India have shown \nthat start-up delays and slow disbursements in the initial years, largely because of delays in \nrecruiting  consultants  and  completing  preparatory  work  before  contract  awards,  could  be \nreduced through provision of up-front TA support prior to loan approval. Moreover, lessons from \nADB\u2019s experience in implementing projects under severe time constraints in locations of difficult \naccessibility and where responsible agencies\u2019 capacity was either limited or had been reduced \nas a result of a disaster (such as in Gujarat,8 Jammu and Kashmir,9 and Kerala and Tamil \nNadu10)  has  shown  that  the  provision  of  a  dedicated  project  support  team  expedites  the \nimplementation process. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA will provide capacity building support to the ongoing project as well as future \nprojects in weak states. It will help mainstream effective and efficient project implementation, \nleading to timely delivery of project benefits, which in turn will lead to inclusive economic growth \nin those states. The TA outcomes will be improved efficiency and effectiveness in managing, \nimplementing, coordinating, and monitoring the implementation of infrastructure and institutional \nreforms under ADB\u2019s investment program. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will be implemented initially in six states, i.e, Tripura, Mizoram, Sikkim, Nagaland, \nMeghalaya where an investment program is currently under implementation (footnote 1), and \nAssam where the processing of the new project in the agriculture and natural resources sector \nis in an advanced stage (footnote 4). The TA scope will be expanded to other weak states as \nnew investment projects are processed and approved, and the TA activities will be adjusted as \nappropriate in coordination with the ADB sector divisions that administer those projects. \n \n8.  Enhancing  projects  processing  and  implementation.  Under  the  TA,  a  projects \nsupport office (PSO) will be established in Guwahati, Assam. Guwahati is selected because of \nits relatively easy access to the other five states as well as to the rest of India. This arrangement \nfollows the successful model of the project support unit established in Jammu and Kashmir \nunder ADB-financed TA.11 The PSO will be staffed with project implementation specialists as \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

The team will provide expert assistance and logistical support to ADB \nprocessing missions and project review missions. The team will also provide assistance to \nofficials of the project executing agencies in advance project preparation activities such as \nfeasibility studies, detailed project reports, and detailed engineering design. Emphasis will be \ngiven to project implementation, by reviewing documents prior to submission to ADB (such as \nbidding documents and bid evaluation reports) as well as providing advice in contract awards, \ncontract management, construction supervision, disbursement, and financial audit. The team \nwill  also  provide  assistance  to  the  project  executing  agencies  in  setting  up  a  project \nmanagement system supported by appropriate computer software. \n \n9.  Developing implementation capacity of state executing agencies. In addition to the \nactivities  mentioned  above,  formal  training  and  workshops  will  be  conducted  in  project \nimplementation,  including  procurement,  recruitment  of  consultants,  disbursements,  contract \nmanagement, and dispute resolution. The TA will assist the executing agencies in assessing the \ntraining needs and in developing suitable training programs. The workshops will be conducted \nby inviting resource persons from ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office and Controller\u2019s \nDepartment, as well as from the national training institutions in India. Formal workshops will also \nbe conducted to develop capacity in preparing and monitoring the social and environmental \nsafeguards in compliance with the safeguards policies of ADB, India, and state governments. \nThese workshops will be conducted by ADB\u2019s safeguards specialists as well as officials from the \ngovernment and the states. \n \n10.  Building public relations. The TA will help the executing agencies and urban local \nbodies conduct effective public relations, consultations, and awareness campaigns with project \nstakeholders,  including  state  officials,  municipal  staff  and  elected  representatives, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  citizens\u2019  groups  to  improve  public  understanding  and \nacceptance of various reforms proposed. A semimonthly publication will be issued featuring \narticles that describe ADB\u2019s activities, as well as salient information about the projects including \ntheir expected impact, outcome, and outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost at $937,500 equivalent, of which $750,000 will be financed \non a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). The \ngovernment, through the states, will provide $187,500 equivalent in kind for counterpart staff, \ndata collection, venues, and facilities for workshops and seminars, and other logistical support. \nDetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  Because of the multistate and multisector nature of the TA, the Department of Economic \nAffairs of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency. ADB and the Department of \nEconomic Affairs will jointly plan the TA inputs and activities, and will regularly review the \nprogress and effectiveness of the TA implementation. \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 26 months, from January 2010 to February 2012. The \nperiod from January to April 2010 will cover preparatory activities, including selection and \nengagement of key experts and establishment of the PSO. The effective implementation will \nstart from April 2010 after the PSO is established and becomes operational. The TA consulting \nservices will include national specialists for six positions with total inputs of 68 person-months. \nThe expertise required includes a project management specialist (20 person-months) who will \n ", "4     \nact as overall PSO team coordinator, a procurement specialist (15 person-months), a financial \nmanagement and accounting specialist (15 person-months), an environmental due diligence \nspecialist (7 person-months), a social safeguards and resettlement specialist (7 person-months), \nand a public relations specialist (4 person-months). Support staff, including a junior engineer or \nanalyst and an office manager or secretary will be provided and hired under the contract of the \nPSO coordinator. Highly qualified and experienced national experts in these areas are available \nin India. Except for the project management specialist, there may be more than one expert for \none specialist position at a time depending on the work requirement. The outline terms of \nreference for each of the positions are in Appendix 3.  \n \n14.  The consultants will be engaged on an individual basis by ADB, in accordance with its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Individual \nconsultants, rather than a firm, are proposed for this TA because (i) the fielding time for each \nconsultant should be kept flexible to ensure the optimum outputs, (ii) some of the consultants \nwill provide intermittent short inputs over a long period of time, (iii) the teamwork among the \nconsultants  is  not  critical,  and  (iv)  the  number  of  consultants  is  not  too  many  and  still \nmanageable if they are recruited individually. Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.12  \n \n15.  The PSO coordinator will prepare brief monthly reports and comprehensive quarterly \nreports covering the progress of the projects and activities of the PSO. At the end of the TA, the \nPSO coordinator will prepare a final report summarizing the TA\u2019s achievements. Each individual \nconsultant is required to prepare an end-of-assignment report for each time they are fielded. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for Multistate and Multisector Project Management Capacity Building, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2008.
