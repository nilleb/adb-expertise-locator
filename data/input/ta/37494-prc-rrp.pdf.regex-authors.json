An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nundertaken. The summary was uploaded on the web site of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) on 31 May 2005. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  (i)  construct  a  64-kilometer  (km)  expressway \nacross hilly and mountainous terrain; (ii) upgrade 129 km of local \nroads,  improving  access  to  52  poor  villages;  and  (iii)  provide \nconsulting  services  and  training  to  enhance  the  quality  of \nconstruction, the maintenance management system, the intelligent \ntransport system, the safety of roads, and the project monitoring \nand evaluation system. \n   \nRationale  The Project is located in Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture, one of \nthe poorest areas in the country, located in northwest Hunan in \nmostly rural and mountainous territory with limited accessibility. \nThe incidence of rural poverty is 30.1%. Eighty percent of the \npopulation lives in rural areas and ethnic minorities, mainly Tujia \nand  Miao,  account  for  some  77%  of  the  population.  The \ninadequate road infrastructure is a major cause of the area\u2019s high \nincidence of poverty: only two thirds of the villages are served by \nroads. Thus despite the region\u2019s economic potential, weaknesses \nin the road infrastructure stunt economic growth. The national \nhighway (NR319), which runs parallel to the project expressway, \nis a combination of class II, III, and IV roads, with steep slopes, \nsharp  turns,  and  low  allowable  speed.  Congestion  is  a  daily \nphenomenon because of the booming mining and agricultural \nprocessing industries. The road network in western Hunan needs \nto be improved to facilitate economic growth and to integrate \npoor, isolated area into the centers of economic growth. \n \nThe  Government  adopted  the  western  region  development \nstrategy (WRDS), a key theme of the 10th Five-Year Plan, to \nenhance economic development in the poor, western part of the \ncountry.  The  WRDS  assigns  high  priority  to  road  sector \ndevelopment as a way to promote economic growth and poverty \nreduction  in  the  western  region.  The  Project  will  support  the \nWRDS by building a 64 km expressway from Jishou to Chadong, \na link in the Changsha-Chongqing corridor, one of the eight high-\npriority western corridors included in the 10th Five-Year Plan. \nThe trip from Jishou to Chadong by car on NR319 currently takes \n4 hours. The project expressway, which will be 30 km shorter, will ", "iv   \ncut travel time to less than 1 hour. By lowering transport costs \nand improving the frequency and level of transport services, the \nProject is expected to spur economic activities, thereby helping \nreduce poverty in the area. The development of the road network \nin Western Hunan will help transfer the benefits of the eastern \nregion\u2019s economic growth to the poor western region. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will help promote sustainable economic growth and \npoverty reduction in Hunan province and the project area. It will \nachieve this by (i) enhancing road transport efficiency and safety; \n(ii) providing a link in the Changsha-Chongqing corridor, one of \neight  high-priority  western  corridors;  and  (iii)  improving  rural \nminority villages\u2019 access to income-generating opportunities and \nsocial services. \n \nThe Project involves (i) constructing a 64 km, access-controlled \ntoll  expressway  from  Jishou  to  Chadong,  including  a  large \nsuspension bridge (1.2 km), 13 tunnels (10.5 km in total), 36 \nextra large or large bridges (18 km in total), interchanges, toll \nstations, and service areas; (ii) upgrading 129 km of local roads \nto improve access to 52 poor villages in the rural minority area; \n(iii) promoting private sector participation through an operation \nand maintenance concession; and (iv) strengthening the Hunan \nprovincial  government\u2019s  capacity  of  construction,  road  safety, \nproject monitoring and evaluation, and asset management and \nmaintenance by means of consulting services and training.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is $519.51 million equivalent, with a \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $263.98  million  (50.8%)  and  a  local \ncurrency cost of $255.53 million equivalent (49.2%). The cost of \nthe local road component is $20.7 million. Of the $208 million ADB \nloan, $8.0 million will finance the local road component. \n   \nFinancing Plan   ($ million)\nForeign  Local  Total \n    Source  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n    Asian Development Bank Loan  208.00  0  208.00 \n    Ministry of Communications   0  59.74  59.74 \n    Hunan Provincial Government   55.98  38.60  94.58 \n    State Development Bank   0  157.19  157.19 \n    Total  263.98  255.53  519.51 \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n     \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $208 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n   \n ", "  v\nAllocation and Relending  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Borrower \nTerms  to Hunan province, which will onlend $200 million to the project \ncompany with the same financial terms and conditions as those \nof the ADB loan. The project company will bear the interest rate \nvariation and foreign exchange risks. Hunan province will keep the \nbalance of $8.0 million to be used for the local road component \nand will bear the interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks \nfor this amount. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The project company will be the implementing agency responsible \nArrangements  for  the  project  expressway.  The  local  road  component  will  be \nimplemented  by  the  Hunan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HCD)  \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for \nthe expressway will be procured through international competitive \nbidding. Procurement for the local roads financed by the $8.0 \nmillion ADB loan will use local competitive bidding. Equipment will \nbe  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  ADB \napproved advance action for the procurement of civil works in \nJune 2005. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  47  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  for  (i)  assisting  with  project  management \nduring the construction period; (ii) providing expertise in bridge \nconstruction,  tunnel  construction,  road  safety,  traffic \nmanagement, and asset management; and (iii) helping formulate \na  human  resource  development  and  training  program.  The \ninternational  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consulting \nServices by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. HCD \nwill  engage  and  finance  3,700  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services.  Of  the  3,700  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services, 300 person-months will be allocated to the \nlocal road component to ensure proper design, supervision, and \nproject management, as well as to train engineering staff. About \n24 person-months will be allocated to monitoring the Project\u2019s \nsocioeconomic and poverty impacts. The domestic consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with government procedures. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The expressway will take 3 hours off the travel time between \nBeneficiaries  Jishou  and  Chadong.  A  better  road  network  will  promote \neconomic growth in the area and integrate poor, isolated regions \nwith the centers of economic growth. Once linked to the major ", "vi   \nroad network, the improved local roads will facilitate the spread of \nthe  expressway\u2019s  benefits  to  the  rural  economy.  Improved \ntransportation will increase income opportunities from cash crop \nfarming or seasonal work involving migration, increase contact \nwith urban centers, and make trips to markets and social services \neasier. \n \nThe project expressway will directly benefit road users, such as \ntransport  providers,  bus  and  truck  operators,  passengers, \ntraders, government officials, and the private sector in general. \nRural households in the project area are also a beneficiary group. \nFarmers will be in a position to increase their agricultural incomes \nthrough better access to markets. The Project will boost tourism \nin the project area, benefiting the poor in the city of Jishou and \nthe  counties  of  Huayuan,  Guzhang,  and  Fenghuang.  The \neconomic internal rate of return for the Project is estimated at \n19.1% and the financial internal rate of return for the expressway \ncomponent  is  estimated  at  5.5%,  higher  than  the  2.8%  real \nweighted average cost of capital. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  be  subject  to  any  significant \ntechnical  risks.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  to  reduce \npotential  technical,  economic,  financial,  and  social  risks.  The \nmain technical risks are associated with the construction of a \nlarge suspension bridge and the 13 tunnels. To mitigate the risks, \ninternational consultants have reviewed the proposed design and \nconstruction  methods.  The  prequalification  of  contractors  will \nfocus  on  their  financial  and  technical  capabilities  in  handling \nsimilar  works.  During  the  construction  period,  monitoring  and \ncontract management information systems will be set up and \nimplemented with the assistance of the consultants for timely \nidentification  of  technical  problems  and  implementation  of \ncorrective  measures.  HCD  has  proven  experience  and  has \nperformed satisfactorily in implementing internationally financed \nprojects. The financial risk associated with the construction and \noperation of the expressway will depend on the level of traffic, the \ncosts of construction, the ability of the commercial management, \nand  the  toll  level.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  the  project \ncompany will build up a commercial business environment for \nexpressway operations, and the project expressway will receive \nsubstantial injections of equity from the central and provincial \ngovernments.  The  social  risks  include  resettlement,  HIV/AIDS \ninfection, and impacts on ethnic minority communities associated \nwith the Project. Appropriate mitigation measures are in place in \nthe resettlement plan and ethnic minorities development plan. \n ", "(cid:49)(cid:49)(cid:48)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:39)(cid:69)

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hunan Roads Development III Project. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC has achieved rapid economic growth and poverty reduction in recent decades. \nGross domestic product has grown more than 9% per year since the 1980s, and the incidence \nof rural poverty fell from 33% in 1978 to just 2.8% in 2004. The PRC\u2019s sustained economic \ngrowth has resulted in an unprecedented expansion in traffic between and within provinces. In \naddition,  the  economy\u2019s  changing  structure  and  increasing  diversification  have  altered  the \npattern of transport demand. The demand for road transport has outpaced that for other modes \nof transport. The movement of goods and passengers by road, which as a means of transport is \nmore flexible and responsive to the needs of a market economy than other modes of transport, \nis  increasing  rapidly.1 The  shift  in  demand  also  reflects  the  loosening  of  anticompetitive \nrestrictions in the road transport industry. Large investments in automotive manufacturing and \nthe country\u2019s rapid economic growth spurred the expansion of vehicle fleets at a pace that will \nlikely be maintained in coming years. \n \n3.  Propelling  the  country\u2019s  robust  growth  and  drastic  poverty  reduction  were  massive \ninvestments in roads. The Government has made major efforts to increase the country\u2019s road \ncapacity to meet the growing demand for improved access to markets and services. At the heart \nof the development of the road network is the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS), a \n35,000-kilometer (km) system of interprovincial expressways and high-class highways (target \ncompletion:  2007).  The  NTHS  will  be  complemented  by  the  development  of  a  network  of \nnational, provincial, county, and township roads. During the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2001\u2013\n2005), the Government (i) accelerated the construction of a network of expressways and high-\nclass highways, giving priority to five north-south and seven west-east sections of the NTHS; (ii) \nstarted the construction of highways in the western region totaling 18,000 km, including the \neight high-priority western corridors2; (iii) targeted opening about 1.95 million km of highways to \ntraffic, with expressways accounting for 35,000 km; and (iv) began to implement the 85,000 km \nnational expressway network plan, slated for completion in 2040, with an annual investment of \nCNY100 billion to CNY150 billion. \n \n4.  As a result, the country\u2019s highway network grew from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.86 \nmillion km in 2004, for an average annual increase of 6%. Of this, 1.52 million km were \nclassified. The total length of expressways increased from 147 km in 1988 to 34,287 km in 2004, \na more than 100-fold expansion. Class I highways increased from 196 km in 1980 to 33,522 km \nin 2004, or 29% per year on average. Class II and above highways accounted for 299,524 km, \nor  19.7%  of  the  total  length.  County,  township,  and  village  roads,  which  the  Ministry  of \n                                                 \n1  Between 1990 and 2004, road traffic grew by about 9.0% per year for passenger traffic, reaching 876.5 billion \npassenger-kilometers, and by 6.0% per year for freight, reaching 759.7 billion ton-km. In Hunan, road passenger \ntraffic grew by 6.4% per year and freight grew by 9.7% per year during the same period. In 2004, road traffic \naccounted for 53.7% of the PRC\u2019s total passenger traffic and 11.4% of its total freight traffic. \n2  These  include  Altai-Hongqilafu,  Xi\u2019ning-Korla,  Yinchuan-Wuhan,  Arongqi-Behai,  Lanzhou-Mohan,  Xi\u2019an-Hefei, \nChangsha-Chongqing, and Chengdu-Zhangmu. ", "2   \nCommunications classifies as rural roads, totaled 2.9 million km in 2004.3 Details of a road \nsector analysis are in Appendix 2. \n \n5.  Even though rural roads play a huge role in poverty reduction, the rural road network, \nwhich accounts for 85% of the country\u2019s total road network of 3.3 million km, is underdeveloped \nin terms of both extent and quality. Thus the 30 million rural poor face significant challenges in \nrelation to transport. Many of them live in isolated villages, which increase their transportation \ncosts, thereby restricting their access to basic goods and services. Most rural roads, especially \nin the western region, are in poor condition because of deficiencies in design and construction, \ninadequate maintenance, and damage caused by overloaded vehicles. The roads\u2019 technical \nstandards are low: only 11% are class III roads or above. Village roads are even worse, with \nmerely 2% being rated as class III or above. Only 20% of county roads, 15% of township roads, \nand 9% of village roads are paved. About 71% of rural roads are dirt roads, making them highly \nvulnerable to bad weather. As a result, many townships and villages still depend on earth tracks \nthat have no drainage system, making them unsuitable for motorized traffic and impassible \nduring the rainy season. This limitation prevents the rural poor from taking advantage of job \nopportunities generated by economic growth. \n \n6.  Aware of the importance of improved access to reducing poverty, the Government has \nbeen pouring funds into rural road construction. During the 10th FYP, it has constructed or \nupgraded approximately 72,000 km of rural roads at a cost of CNY60.9 billion. By 2010, paved \nroads will link all villages in the eastern region, 80% of villages in the central region, and 90% of \nvillages in the western region. To this end, the Government plans to invest CNY100 billion more \nin rural roads during the 11th FYP (2006\u20132010).  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Problems and Constraints \n \n7.  Despite the huge amount of investment, the road network still does not provide access to \nlarge parts of the country, particularly the poorer inland regions, and is inadequate to support \nsustainable economic growth. Roads built to a high standard (above class II) account for only \n19.7% of the total network. The remaining 20% are medium- to low-grade paved roads and gravel \nroads (para. 5). As a result, the expansion in the demand for road transport has strained the \nroad infrastructure, as manifested by bottlenecks in the network. The resulting high cost of \nshipping goods between inland provinces and ports has been a serious constraint.4  \n \n8.  Hunan, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, is bordered by Jiangxi to the \neast, Chongqing and Guizhou to the west, Guangxi and Guangdong to the south, and Hubei to \nthe north. In 2004, the province\u2019s per capita gross domestic product was CNY7,546, or 83% of \nthe national average. The Project is located in Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture in northwest \nHunan, and is one of the poorest areas in the country. Located mostly in rural and mountainous \nterritory, accessibility is limited. The incidence of rural poverty is 30.1%. The project area \nconsists of one city and four counties, with 80% of the population living in rural areas. Ethnic \nminorities, mainly Tujia and Miao, account for some 77% of the population. The prefecture \npossesses water resources, mineral deposits, coal reserves, fertile soil, and tourism potential.5 \n                                                 \n3  Of the total rural roads, 479,372 km are county roads, 945,180 km are township roads, and 1,473,534 km are \nvillage roads. \n4 The shortage of adequate road networks has thus hindered economic growth and regional development in the PRC. \n5  Mineral resources are abundant: more than 50 kinds of minerals, including coal, iron, and manganese, have been \ndiscovered in 480 mines. ", "  3\nIts major agricultural outputs are citrus fruits, corn, ramie, tea, rice, and tobacco. The leading \nindustries, most of which are in Jishou city, the prefecture\u2019s capital, are coal, agricultural and \nchemical processing, power, machinery manufacture, construction materials, and textiles. \n \n9.  The area\u2019s remoteness and inadequate road infrastructure are among the main causes \nof the area\u2019s high incidence of poverty. Only two thirds of villages are served by roads. While \ndemand for the prefecture\u2019s products from other provinces has been increasing continuously, \nthe weaknesses in the road infrastructure are hindering economic growth in the project area and \nin Hunan. The national highway (NR319), which runs parallel to the project expressway, is a \ncombination of class II, III, and IV roads, with steep slopes, sharp turns, and low allowable \nspeed.  Congestion  is  a  daily  occurrence  because  of  the  booming  mining  and  agricultural \nprocessing industries. Traffic on NR319 has grown by about 7.3% per year in recent years, and \nalong several stretches will exceed the road\u2019s capacity by 2008. Improvement of the road \nnetwork in western Hunan is needed to facilitate economic growth and to integrate the poor, \nisolated regions of the country with the centers of economic growth. \n \n10.  Poor road conditions have resulted in inadequate and unaffordable transport services in \nthe area. The poor quality of the roads deters licensed bus and truck operators from plying the \nroutes to townships and villages. As a result, many villages and townships in the project area \nstill have no direct bus service. In addition, the fares and routes of the formal bus system are \nregulated, which often results in inefficient services. Thus villagers have to rely on informal \nmeans of transport, such as bicycles and motorized tricycles. Because informal means of \ntransport are constrained to local services between villages and townships, it has limitation to \nreplace the formal transport system. For selling their products, the rural poor thus often rely on \ntraders who drive to villages with a stronger bargaining power. \n \n2.  Government\u2019s and Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategies \n \n11.  The Government\u2019s strategy for road development is to construct expressways to expand \nthe NTHS and link all cities with populations of more than 500,000 and develop secondary \nroads, particularly those that will connect to rural markets. The Government has also adopted \nthe western region development strategy, a key theme of the 10th FYP, to enhance economic \ndevelopment in the western part of the country, where most of the poor reside. The strategy, \nwhich aims to reduce the disparity between western and coastal regions, assigns high priority to \nroad sector development as a way to promote economic growth and poverty reduction in the \nwestern region. \n \n12.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) operational strategy in the PRC\u2019s road sector \nsupports  (i)  the  construction  of  roads  that  connect  major  growth  centers  with  hinterland \neconomies; (ii) the integration of the network so that the NTHS is supported by a system of local \nroads, particularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) the delivery of adequate and \naffordable transport services; (iv)  the promotion of road safety and the reduction of  vehicle \nemissions; (v) the strengthening of institutions to increase financial and managerial efficiency in \nexpressway operation; (vi) the adoption of appropriate pricing policies to optimize road transport \ncapacity; and (vii) the use of alternative methods of investment financing, including private \nsector participation. In line with the Government\u2019s strategy, ADB road sector assistance has \nalso targeted the poor, less developed central and western provinces. The proposed Project is \nconsistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. \n \n3.  Opportunities \n \n13.  The Project will support the western region development strategy by building a 64 km \nexpressway from Jishou to Chadong, a link in the Changsha\u2013Chongqing corridor, one of the ", "4   \neight high-priority western corridors included in the 10th FYP.6 The trip from Jishou to Chadong \nby car on NR319 currently takes 4 hours. The project expressway, which will be 30 km shorter, \nwill cut travel time to less than 1 hour. By lowering transport costs and improving the frequency \nand level of transport services, the Project is expected to spur economic activities and inter-\nregional trade, thereby helping reduce poverty in the project area. The development of the road \nnetwork in Western Hunan will help transfer the benefits of the eastern region\u2019s economic \ngrowth to the poor western region. A local road improvement program was integrated into the \nProject to expand the road network in rural minority villages. The integrated approach will help \nspread the expressway\u2019s benefits to the poor. \n \n14.  The evaluations of several completed road projects financed by ADB have confirmed the \nimpacts of road investments on poverty reduction.7 Several ADB studies have also affirmed the \nrelevance  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy,8 showing  that  road  infrastructure  has  contributed  to  poverty \nreduction in the PRC not only by directly improving the living conditions of the poor, but also by \ndiversifying their sources of income and helping to increase their productivity. The findings of an \nADB-funded technical assistance (TA) for Socioeconomic Impacts of Road Projects9 confirmed \nthe validity of the road portfolio\u2019s geographic focus: the poorer western interior provinces. The \nTA showed that complementary investments in local roads strengthen the impact of expressway \ninvestments. As such, ADB has expended rigorous efforts to identify road projects that have a \ntight focus on poverty. \n \n15.  External assistance has been provided to help the Government streamline its road \nsector  strategy  and  investment  projects,  mainly  by  ADB,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation, and the World Bank. Since 1991, ADB has extended 31 loans totaling $6.2 billion \nto finance 4,391 km of expressways and 8,237 km of associated local road networks. As of \n1995, local roads have been included in the scope of road projects to make ADB\u2019s interventions \nin the road sector more pro-poor. Of the ADB-funded projects, 18 have already been completed \nand are open to traffic. ADB has also supplied 54 TA packages totaling $28.3 million to the road \nsector. The advisory TAs have addressed policy and institutional issues, including highway \nplanning,  road  safety,  human  resources  development,  socioeconomic  assessment,  and \ntransport pricing and the mobilization of nongovernment financial resources. The World Bank \nand the Japan Bank for International Cooperation have provided about $6.6 billion and \u00a5219 \nmillion,  respectively,  to  finance  road  investments.  ADB  coordinates  with  both  these \norganizations to ensure that each major development partner focuses on different corridors, and \ninformation related to policy advice is shared across the development community (Appendix 3). \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n \n16.  The Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HCD) has had experience as an \nexecuting agency for five externally financed road projects, including two projects financed by \n                                                 \n6  These include Altai\u2013Hongqilafu, Xi\u2019ning\u2013Korla, Yinchuan\u2013Wuhan, Arongqi\u2013Behai, Lanzhou\u2013Mohan, Xi\u2019an\u2013Hefei, \nChangsha\u2013Chongqing, and Chengdu\u2013Zhangmu. \n7  ADB. 2000.

", "  5\nADB.10 The operation and maintenance (O&M) of the first ADB-financed expressways was \nawarded as a concession to a company in 1998, a move that introduced sound business \npractices  to  Hunan\u2019s  expressway  sector.  However,  an  important  lesson  learned  from  this \nProject11 was that concessions to private companies should be awarded through transparent \ncompetitive  bidding  to  maximize  the  benefits  of  the  concession  to  efficient  expressway \noperation. Other lessons include (i) the need for traffic forecasts to reflect rapid economic \ngrowth, thereby avoiding expensive road widening within the first few years of operation; (ii) the \nadvantages  of  a  participatory  approach  to  project  preparation;  (iii)  the  benefits  of  a  well-\ncoordinated resettlement schedule, preceded by consultations with the affected parties before \ntheir relocation; (iv) the advantages of using road safety audits in designing and constructing \nexpressways; and (v) the need for careful geological investigation during the design stage to \nminimize unnecessary contract variations. All these issues have been taken into account during \nproject preparation. Due attention has been given to the adequacy of the O&M framework to \nensure that the concession is reasonably priced by awarding it through transparent bidding \n(para.  32).  Consultations  with  affected  villagers  were  emphasized  from  the  start,  and \ninternational consulting inputs for the supervision of civil works were included to ensure a \ncareful review of geological investigations for the Project. \n \n17.  Performance reviews of completed road projects have concluded that all loans to the \nroad  sector  in  the  PRC  have  been  or  are  being  implemented  satisfactorily.12 Of  seven \ncompleted  projects,  six  were  rated  as  generally  successful  and  one  was  rated  as  partly \nsuccessful. The performance audit reports for three road projects concluded that they were \neither highly successful or successful.13 The lessons gleaned from previous ADB-financed road \nprojects are reflected in the design of the Project. To avoid delayed loan effectiveness caused \nby  delays  in  procurement,  a  tendering  company  was  recruited  to  prequalify  civil  works \ncontractors.  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  and  requirements,  including  anticorruption \nprovisions, were discussed extensively during appraisal. Emphasis was put on the need to (i) \nstrictly  follow  ADB\u2019s  mandatory  bidding  documents,  (ii)  evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-\napproved evaluation criteria, and (iii) substantiate clearly the conclusions of the bid evaluation. \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue  \n \n18.  Transport Services in the Project Area. The extent to which the rural poor benefit from \na road project depends on their access to reliable and affordable transport services. Adequate \ntransport services provided on a competitive basis are a prerequisite for spreading the Project\u2019s \nbenefits to the rural poor, especially those who are currently beyond the reach of road transport \nservices.  During  project  preparation,  due  attention  was  given  to  the  delivery  of  efficient, \naffordable, and sustainable transport services in the project area. The TA survey indicated that \nwhen roads are upgraded, transport services improve shortly thereafter and the frequency of \nvillagers\u2019 trips to local markets and towns increases significantly.14 The improvement of local \nroads will thus spur transport service providers to improve transport services. Further, with \n                                                 \n10 One is the Hunan Expressway Project (approved in 1993), under which the Changsha\u2013Xiangtan and Changsha\u2013\nYongan sections were constructed (open to traffic in 1996). The other is the Hunan Roads Development II Project \n(approved 2004), under which the Changde\u2013Huaihua section (173 km) is under implementation. \n11 ADB. 2000.

", "6   \nincreased competition among transport service providers, poor rural farmers who rarely use \nroads will also benefit from improved transport services by way of higher farm-gate prices for \ntheir  cash  crops  and  more  frequent  visits  from  extension  and  health  personnel  (including \nveterinarians) and public servants and officials. \n \n19.  Expanding access to transport services is an integral part of Hunan\u2019s plan for transport \nservices. Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture,15 where the Project is located, has only one class II \nbus terminal in Jishou city, and more than 80% of townships do not have even rural bus stations. \nTo enhance the sustainable delivery of transport services, the prefecture has implemented a \nplan to construct class I\u2013IV bus terminals.16 A class I bus terminal is being constructed in Jishou \nand is scheduled to open in 2006. The construction of class II bus terminals in five counties is \nalso under way and at least one class II bus terminal will be built in each of the three remaining \ncounties during the period of the 11th FYP. The prefecture aims to build a class V rural bus \nstation in each village by 2015, 15 of which will be completed in the project area by 2007. HCD \nagreed to implement these facilities in tandem with the Project to ensure the efficient provision \nof transport services when the project roads have been built (Appendix 4). \n \n20.  Small Business Development Opportunities. Basic prerequisites for developing small \nbusinesses in the project area are generally met. Active secondary and tertiary markets and \nmicrofinance schemes for small businesses are available under provincial programs. Several \npoverty reduction programs are being implemented either by the government or multilateral \nassistance agencies. These programs will complement each other and provide a good basis for \nsetting up small businesses. In the project area, a wide assortment of businesses has already \nbeen established to provide basic necessities for local communities and travelers.17 When roads \nare improved, existing enterprises are expected to expand further their businesses. The TA \nsurvey shows that the current trend evinces an inherent entrepreneurial spirit among local \nresidents who, if given the opportunity, are likely to establish commercial enterprises. A number \nof factories are located along NR319, an indication that the proposed expressway may attract \nlarger commercial establishments to the vicinity. With the improved road network in the area, \nthe following sectors were identified as potential sectors for small business opportunities: (i) \nagriculture and agro-industry, (ii) herbal medicines and handicrafts, and (iii) community-based \ntourism and distribution facilities. \n \n21.  Under the TA, a strategy was prepared to develop small businesses and commercial \nactivities that includes (i) developing new community-based enterprises, (ii) building roadside \nstations as focal points for small businesses, (iii) creating economic zones for small businesses, \nand (iv) establishing a cultural zone for minorities where local minority communities can develop \ntheir entrepreneurial activities. Assistance is needed to channel local people into potential areas \nof  business  and  commercial  opportunities.  HCD  will  ensure  that  assistance,  such  as  the \nprovision  of  microfinance  and  entrepreneurial  training,  will  be  provided  through  provincial \npoverty reduction programs (Appendix 5). \n \n22.  Private Sector Participation. In the PRC, the private sector has been involved in road \nprojects through cooperative joint ventures, securitization, revenue bond financing, and build-\noperate-transfer contracts. In line with ADB\u2019s private sector development strategy, Hunan has \n                                                 \n15 The prefecture comprises 8 counties, 218 townships, and 2,664 villages. \n16 A bus terminal is classified according to its daily passenger handling capacity. A class I terminal handles more than \n10,000 passengers per day, a class II terminal handles 5,000 to 10,000 passengers, and a class V terminal \nhandles up to 500 passengers. \n17 Each kilometer of road averages about four businesses. One local road to be included in the Project has about six \nbusinesses per kilometer. ", "  7\nactively  diversified  highway  financing:  to  date,  the  private  sector  is  involved  in  five \nexpressways.18 Except for the Changsha\u2013Xiangtan West section, which was implemented using \na build-operate-transfer method, the other four sections with private sector participation have \ntapped the private sector for O&M through concession agreements. For the project expressway, \nthe  private  sector  will  also  be  involved  in  O&M  through  a  concession  when  the  financial \nrequirement is met (para. 32). \n \n23.  Road Safety. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC. In 2004, 41 deaths occurred \nper 10,000 vehicles, which is high by international standards. The Ministry of Public Security is \ncommitted to reducing accidents through improved vehicular safety, driver training, and traffic \nmanagement. The Road Traffic Safety Law went into effect in May 2004. A committee was \nestablished  to  develop  and  implement  special  measures  that  would  enforce  nationwide \nregulations on overloaded trucks, including putting axle load limits on roads. HCD and the \nHunan Public Security Bureau are working together to fulfill the requirements of the new law and \nenhance road safety. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the expressway, HCD will (i) \nimplement a road safety action plan\u2014with the help of an international consultant\u2014for the safe \noperation of the expressway; and (ii) ensure, in collaboration with Hunan Public Security Bureau, \nthat a team of bureau personnel will patrol the expressway and enforce the new law and \nregulations.  The  Project\u2019s  major  contribution  to  road  safety  will  be  the  application  of  high \nconstruction standards to the expressway to reduce accidents in the corridor. An international \nroad safety specialist will be engaged for 2 months under the Project to help HCD develop the \nroad safety action plan and check designs and safety aspects of the project roads (Appendix 6). \n \n24.  Vehicle  Emissions. The increasing number of vehicles has raised concerns about \nvehicle  emissions  and  air  pollution.  The  Government  has  taken  several  steps  to  control \nemissions: imposing regulations on the automobile industry, requiring an annual vehicle test, \nand  drafting  a  vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  program.  The  new  measures  also  set \nemission  and  fuel  efficiency  targets  and  offer  tax  incentives  for  manufacturers  of  more \nenvironmentally-friendly  cars.  Hunan  has  vehicle  emission  standards,  and  the  Hunan \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau (HEPB) regularly tests all types of vehicles. Meanwhile, the \nProject will have positive impacts on air pollution, as emissions from vehicles along the project \nroads are expected to be lower because of better traffic flows as a result of improved road \nconditions. Upon completion of the Project, sulfur dioxide emissions from vehicles on the project \nroads  are  estimated  to  be  20%  lower  than  before  the  Project.  Likewise,  nitrogen  oxides \nemissions will be 12% lower than before the Project and carbon dioxideemissions will be20% \n   \nlower. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the expressway, HCD will provide ADB with (i) \nthe regulations for vehicle emission limits and the penalties for violating emission standards; \nand (ii) the latest government plan to improve air quality in Hunan, including cleaner fuel \nprograms. With the assistance of consultants, HCD and HEPB will develop an action plan to \ncontrol vehicle emissions in the area and implement it accordingly (Appendix 6). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n25.  The Project will help promote sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in \nHunan province as a whole and the project area in particular. It will achieve this by (i) enhancing \n                                                 \n18 The  five  sections  with  private  sector  participation  are  Changsha\u2013Xiangtan,  Changsha\u2013Yongan,  Xiangtan\u2013\nHengyang, Changsha\u2013Xiangtan West, and Changsha\u2013Yiyang. Of these, Changsha\u2013Xiangtan, and Changsha\u2013\nYongan were funded by ADB (footnote 9). ", "8   \nroad transport efficiency and safety; (ii) improving the road transport network by building a \nsection from Jishou to Chadong in the Changsha\u2013Chongqing western corridor, one of eight \nhigh-priority western corridors; and (iii) improving rural minority villages\u2019 access to income-\ngenerating opportunities and social services. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n26.  The Project comprises (i) the construction of a 64 km, access-controlled toll expressway \nfrom Jishou to Chadong, including a large suspension bridge (1.2 km), 13 tunnels (10.5 km in \ntotal), 36 extra large or large bridges (18 km in total), interchanges, toll stations, and service \nareas; (ii) the upgrading of 129 km of local roads to improve access to 52 poor villages in the \nrural  minority  area;  (iii)  the  promotion  of  private  sector  participation  through  the  O&M \nconcession;  and  (iv)  the  strengthening  of  the  Hunan  provincial  government\u2019s  capacity  in \nconstruction,  road  safety,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  asset  management  and \nmaintenance through the provision of consulting services and training. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n27.  Integrated Design of the Local Road Component. In line with ADB\u2019s policy dialogue \nwith the Government, a local road improvement program was integrated into the Project to \nexpand the road network in rural minority villages. The integrated approach will help spread the \nexpressway\u2019s benefits to the poor. Better tie-ins between the expressway and local roads will \nenable more agricultural products to reach markets and allow farmers to upgrade their farming \npractices. As reliable transport to markets becomes more readily available, cash crop farming in \nremote or isolated areas will be stimulated and access to off-farm employment opportunities will \nbe  broadened.  The  Project  includes  two  priority  sections,  selected  from  Hunan\u2019s  road \ndevelopment plan in its local road component. The two sections total 129 km and serve 52 poor \nminority villages in the project area, particularly where access to township centers needs to be \nimproved. \n \n28.  Of the ADB loan, $8.0 million will be allocated to the local road component, which will. \nBoth sections are currently unclassified roads, but will be upgraded to class III and IV roads. \nSome 929,000 people (69% of the population in the project area) will benefit from the Project, of \nwhich 389,100 in the poor minority villages will benefit from improved local roads.19 The local \nroads will (i) be upgraded concurrently with the project expressway, (ii) use Government\u2019s \ndesign standards that are acceptable to ADB, (iii) follow ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies, and \n(iv)  be  accorded  the  same  degree  of  attention  as  the  expressway  in  relation  to  impact \nmonitoring. Some 300 person-months of domestic consultants will be allocated to the local road \ncomponent  to  ensure  proper  design  and  supervision,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nengineering staff training, and project management. \n \n29.  Local Road Maintenance. Adequate maintenance is crucial to ensure the sustainability \nof rural roads, a job for which local administrative units are responsible. During the TA, the \nfollowing were examined: (i) planning of and standards for maintenance, (ii) funding sources, \nand (iii) monitoring of maintenance activities. The quality of rural roads does not seem to be \nsystematically  monitored  by  the  higher  authorities  concerned.  Maintenance  planning  often \nhinges on subjective assessments, mainly because of the local government\u2019s lack of resources \n                                                 \n19 The section in Hauyuan county serves the Miao minority area and the section that links Baoijing and Guzhang \ncounties serves the Tujia minority area. The location of three of the four interchanges was determined in such a \nway that the benefits from the project expressway are made available to the rural minorities. ", "  9\nfor maintaining its road networks. Local authorities draft plans for routine maintenance work, but \nperiodic maintenance is rather budget-driven and lacks a systematic, preventive approach. Little \ndissemination of the activities or knowledge needed to monitor performance is apparent across \ncounties. There is no official funding channel for the maintenance of township or village roads.20 \nTherefore a reliable funding mechanism for maintaining and rehabilitating rural roads must be \ndesigned.  Considering  limited  funds  for  maintenance,  a  simple  method  for  evaluating  and \nprioritizing maintenance works must also be established to streamline work programming and \nensure effective fund use. Apart from the financial angle, local governments\u2019 maintenance \nefforts are often hampered by the lack of qualified technical and managerial personnel, training \nresources, and equipment. \n \n30.  During  project  preparation,  an  action  plan  was  devised  to  strengthen  local  road \nmaintenance and was agreed to with HCD. According to the plan, HCD will develop a sound \nroad  maintenance  management  system  during  project  implementation.  The  system  will  (i) \nincorporate  measures  to  minimize  maintenance  costs;  (ii)  include  a  modern  method  of \nevaluation and maintenance prioritization for efficient work programming and fund use; (iii) \ninclude a compilation of road inventories, together with basic condition data; and (iv) have a \nmonitoring system to be used by local residents. Furthermore, HCD will encourage county \ngovernments to adopt competitive bidding to enhance efficiency when selecting maintenance \ncontractors. A training program will be provided under the Project to strengthen the capacity of \nlocal government maintenance units (Appendix 7). \n \n31.  Operation and Maintenance Concession. Expressway O&M improves substantially \nwhen  handled  by  the  private  sector.  An  O&M  concession  is  an  agreement  between  a \ngovernment  or  a  state  enterprise  and  a  private  enterprise,  whereby  the  private  enterprise \nmaintains the road according to agreed standards and collects tolls from users that finance the \nmaintenance  and  reward  the  concessionaire.  O&M  concessions  sidestep  public  sector \nbudgetary constraints by securing toll revenues as a maintenance fund without requiring the \nfunds to flow through the government\u2019s budgeting process and increase service efficiency by \nbringing in an experienced private sector concessionaire that can operate and maintain the \nproject expressway at a lower cost than the government can. Under an O&M contract, the \nconcessionaire  assumes  the  traffic  risk  and,  ultimately,  the  revenue  risk  as  well.21 O&M \nconcession is therefore a feasible public-private sector partnering option since it distributes \nproject risks reasonably between the government and the private sector. \n \n32.  When the Project expressway\u2019s operating-profit ratio exceeds 10%, HCD will use its best \nefforts to award an O&M concession to a private enterprise, through a competitive bidding. In \nparticular, based on lessons learned from previous projects (para. 16), due attention will be \ngiven to enhance transparency in the bidding process for the concession, to optimize the gain of \nthe concession to the efficiency in expressway operation. In this regard, HCD, with the help of \nan international consultant to be engaged under the Hunan Roads Development II Project, \nprepare the bidding documents and the O&M concession framework. The framework will specify \nthe concession period and selection criteria, and ensure adequate pricing and transparent \nauctioning. HCD will submit the bidding documents and the concession framework to ADB for \nreview by 30 June 2006. \n                                                 \n20 The counties are responsible for county and township road maintenance (mostly class IV and above), for which \nthey use their road maintenance funds. However, villagers carry out the maintenance of village roads (below class \nIV), which account for two thirds of the roads in the prefecture. \n21 ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Hunan Roads Development II Project. Manila. Further details are presented in \nAppendix 5. ", "10  \n33.  Intelligent Transport System (ITS). An expressway ITS22 is being developed in Hunan, \nfollowing the drafting by HCD of an ITS policy in 2002 using standards prepared by the national \nITS Center. The ITS policy\u2019s objectives are to (i) introduce a network-wide toll system for all \nexpressways in Hunan, (ii) reduce the time it takes to pay a toll, (iii) improve safety through \nenhanced electronic enforcement and monitoring, (iv) provide up-to-date information to travelers, \n(iv) provide assistance in emergencies, and (v) improve traffic management and infrastructure \nmaintenance. In line with this policy, equipment for the ITS will be procured under the Project to \nenhance the effectiveness of traffic surveillance, traffic management and tunnel safety, and the \nmonitoring of toll plazas.23 About 4% of the ADB loan ($7.6 million) will be allocated to procure \nITS equipment, and training in its use will be provided with the help of consulting services \n(Appendix 8). \n \n34.  Asset Management. Asset management must be developed to ensure the sustainability \nof the expressway and local road operations. During project implementation, HCD will prepare \nan asset management development plan, which will establish a computerized database system \nand  promote  the  use  of  modern  equipment,  and  provide  a  training  program  to  enhance \nemployees\u2019 skills at the provincial, county, and township levels. To facilitate the implementation \nof the plan, consultants will be hired to formulate an action plan comprising: (i) immediate \nmeasures needed when the project company is set up and the organizational structure is put in \nplace, (ii) short-term measures needed prior to the completion of the expressway, and (iii) \nmedium-term measures needed within the first 3 years of expressway operations. HCD will \nassign the Hunan Communications College to develop a training program to enhance the skills \nof  provincial  and  local  government  staff  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  operation  of  the \nexpressway and local roads (Appendix 8). \n \n35.  Stakeholder Consultations. During preparation of the feasibility study, environmental \nimpact assessment and resettlement planning consultations were conducted with government \nagencies, villagers, local groups, and other people likely to be affected by the Project to discuss \nenvironmental concerns, land acquisition and resettlement issues, and economic development \npotential. Village investigations and surveys were conducted in the project area to assess the \npotential adverse effects and benefits of the Project. Over 3,450 people were interviewed during \nthe course of public opinion surveys, social and environmental assessments, and resettlement \nplanning. For the resettlement plan, consultation meetings were held with representatives of \naffected counties, townships, and villages. Rural people were familiar with the Project and public \nsupport for it was high. Local officials explained the policies and regulations for compensation to \nthose who would be adversely affected by the loss of farmland or housing. The consultation \nprocess was expanded to finalize the design and formulate appropriate compensation standards \nand rehabilitation measures for people displaced by land acquisition or house demolition. Villagers \nparticipated in the discussions and decisions on village resettlement (Appendix 9). \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n36.  The total cost of the Project is $519.51 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost \nof $263.98 million (50.8%) and a local currency cost of $255.53 million equivalent (49.2%). The \ncost of the local road component is $20.7 million. Of the $208 million ADB loan, $8.0 million is \nallocated for the local road component, with the remaining costs to be funded by the provincial \n                                                 \n22 The application of information technology to transport is referred to as an intelligent transport system.  \n23 Equipment  for  the  ITS  includes  a  traffic  control  center,  toll  revenue  management  centers,  toll  system, \ncommunications system, traffic surveillance system, overloaded vehicle checking system, tunnel ventilation and \nsafety, emergency service facilities, and so on.

Financing Plan \n \n37.  The Government has requested a loan of $208 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The Borrower of the Loan will be the PRC. The loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft Loan and Project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n38.  The  Ministry  of  Communications  and  the  Hunan  Provincial  Government  (HPG)  will \nprovide 30% of the project costs on a grant basis. The Ministry of Communications grant will \namount to $59.74 million and the HPG grant to $94.58 million. The State Development Bank will \nprovide a $157.19 million loan on a 25-year term at an interest rate of 5.51%. The ADB loan \nproceeds will be made available by the Borrower to HPG, which will onlend $200 million to the \nproject company with the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The \nproject company will bear the interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks. Hunan province \nwill keep the balance of $8.0 million and use it for the local road component; it will bear the ", "12  \ninterest rate variation and foreign exchange risks for this amount.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.   Project Management \n \n39.  HCD will be the executing agency responsible for the overall implementation of the \nProject and direct implementation of the local road component. The project company will be the \nimplementing agency and will coordinate and monitor the expressway\u2019s construction activities \nand operate the expressway. Its general manager, the project director, will be responsible for \noverall  project  management  in  relation  to  the  expressway,  the  approval  of  contracts,  and \npayments.  HCD  will  implement  the  local  road  component  through  local  communications \nbureaus. A project implementation unit established within the project company will facilitate land \nacquisition, resettlement, and environmental protection measures and will ensure that local \nconcerns are addressed adequately. The unit will be headed by a project manager, who will \noversee day-to-day physical implementation activities and prepare progress reports. In addition \nto its central office, the project company will have four toll stations and three maintenance \ncenters.  HCD  has  sufficient  technical  capability  to  implement  the  Project;  however,  its \ninstitutional capacity needs to be further strengthened in some areas such as the ITS and asset \nmanagement and assistance will be provided under the consulting services. \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n40.  Preconstruction  activities\u2014detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \nprequalification of contractors, and tendering and awarding of contracts\u2014has begun in October \n2005. Completion of the preconstruction activities is targeted for November 2006. Preliminary \ndesign was completed in April 2005 and detailed design will be completed in December 2005. \nThe construction of the expressway is scheduled to start in December 2006 and the Project will \nbe completed by December 2011. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n  3.  Procurement \n \n41.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The main \ncivil works will be divided into 18 packages, the pavement into 2 packages, and the equipment \ninto 3 packages, all of which will be procured under international competitive bidding procedures \n(Appendix  12).  Ancillary  facilities,  including  the  administration  building  and  service  areas \nbuilding under domestic financing, and equipment for traffic engineering, will be procured using \nlocal competitive bidding. Procurement for the local roads will use local competitive bidding. The ", "  13\ninternational  bidding  will  be  conducted  by  a  qualified  tendering  company  with  previous \nexperience in externally funded projects. Only prequalified contractors with adequate technical \nand financial capacities will be allowed to bid for several packages and may be awarded more \nthan one contract based on the least-cost combination of contracts. The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all documents and contracts related to the bidding \nfor and implementation of the Project. \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n42.  The Project will finance 47 person-months of international consulting services. Of the 47 \nperson-months of international consultants, 36 will be for the supervision of the civil works, six \nwill be for bridge construction, two each will be for road safety and traffic management and \ntunnel construction, and one will be for asset management. HCD will engage and finance 3,700 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. Of the 3,700 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices, 300 person-months will be allocated to the local road component to ensure proper \ndesign, supervision, and project management, as well as to train engineering staff. About 24 \nperson-months will be allocated to monitoring the Project\u2019s socioeconomic and poverty impacts. \nThe international consultants will be financed by the ADB loan and will be recruited through a \nfirm  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consulting  Services  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers. The domestic consultants will be financed from domestic \nresources and will be recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. \nHCD  will establish three resident supervision engineer offices for construction supervision, \nenvironmental and resettlement monitoring, and project performance monitoring and evaluation. \nThe chief supervision engineer\u2019s office will be responsible for overall project supervision. The \nchief supervision engineer will be assisted by two deputies, one of whom will be the team leader \nof the international consultants. The team leader will help the chief supervision engineer with \nproject  and  contract  management  activities  and  certify  progress  payments  and  contract \nvariations prior to their approval by the chief supervision engineer. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n43.  The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.24 \nBecause most of the payments will be made for large contracts (above $100,000 equivalent), \ndirect payments, reimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw loan \nfunds.  If  government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement \nprocedure  will  be  followed.  To  expedite  the  flow  of  funds,  the  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual payment  not \nexceeding $100,000 equivalent. \n \n  6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n44.  HCD  and  the  project company  will  maintain separate  accounts  for  the  Project and \nrelated financial statements and will have them audited annually in accordance with appropriate \nauditing standards consistently applied by external auditors whose qualifications, experience, \nand terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. HCD and the project company will submit to \nADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year the project company\u2019s audited \nconsolidated financial statements. To ensure that internal controls and checks on the project \nconstruction costs and operations are effective, HCD will establish an internal audit unit and will \nmaintain  it  during  implementation  and  operation  of  the  Project.  The  unit  will  undertake \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. ", "14  \nindependent tests on day-to-day transactions, prior to reference to external auditors. HCD will \nmake  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  implementation  progress  through  quarterly \nprogress reports. Within 3 months of completion, HCD will submit a project completion report to \nADB. \n \n  7.  Anticorruption  \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with, HDC. Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through HCD, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy were included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProject. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.25 ADB\u2019s program for the \nPRC includes assistance that will improve governance and provide incentives to reduce the \nlevel of corruption over the long term. Based on the recommendations of the July 2004 PRC \nCountry Performance Portfolio Mission, ADB will organize a seminar on how to detect fraud and \ncorruption during procurement in 2005. \n \n46.  In relation to the Project, HCD will ensure (i) that a supervisory body is established to \nprevent undue interference in business practices with adequate resources made available for its \neffective operation; (ii) that a leading group of officials from HCD\u2019s Supervision Division is \nlocated in offices involved in project bidding, construction, and other operational activities; (iii) \nthat briefings between HCD and the Prosecutor's Office are held on a regular basis to share \ninformation  on  or  warnings  about  any  corrupt  practices detected;  (iv)  that  the  contractors\u2019 \nactivities in relation to fund withdrawals and settlements are periodically inspected; and (v) that \na dual signing system is introduced whereby the civil works contract winner also signs an \nanticorruption contract with the employer. \n \n  8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n47.  To  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  its  operations  and  to  be  accountable  for  its \nperformance to stakeholders, ADB uses the project performance management system. The \nmonitoring will be undertaken with a focus on a few key representative communities in the \nproject area. A basic monitoring framework was constructed for the Project to permit a more \ndefinitive  assessment  of  the  actual  benefits.  HCD  has  concurred  with  (i)  the  monitoring \nframework, (ii) the set of indicators to be used for monitoring and evaluating the Project\u2019s \nimpacts, and (iii) the three representative villages in the project area. The indicators were \nselected based on the findings of the ADB-financed TA for the Socioeconomic Assessment of \nRoad Projects (footnote 8). The baseline values for the indicators were established, where \navailable, during project preparation, and will be updated at project inception. The indicators will \nbe  measured  at  project  completion  and  biennially  for  5  years  following  completion.  By \nDecember 2006, HCD will recruit an independent local institute to provide 24 person-months for \nsurveys, analyses, and reporting. A report summarizing the key findings will be submitted to \nADB. HCD and local governments have assured that adequate monitoring will be carried out in \nthe selected communities (Appendix 13). \n                                                 \n25 The Government has made significant efforts to combat corruption in the road sector. To date, 15 government \nofficials from 10 provinces have been found to be involved in corruption. Information related to these corruption \ncases is in the public domain. According to the China National Audit Office, there is no evidence that any of the \nreported corruption was related to ADB-funded road projects. ", "  15\n  9.  Project Review  \n \n48.  In 2008, ADB and HCD will carry out a midterm review of the Project, focusing on policy, \ninstitutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, financial, \nand other relevant factors that may have an  impact on the Project\u2019s performance and its \ncontinuing viability. The review will examine progress in sectoral reforms, policy development, \nresettlement, and compliance with assurances in the Loan Agreement. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n49.  The Project will increase the corridor\u2019s capacity to meet the demand for transport and \nreduce transport costs, travel time, and accident rates. It will provide employment opportunities \nboth during and after construction and will be a conduit for increased economic growth and \nhigher  incomes.  The  local  road  component  will  help  bring  these  benefits  to  the  poorest \ncommunities in the project area. Traffic on the expressway is forecast to grow from 6,000 \nannual average daily traffic in 2010 to 12,650 in 2019, an average annual increase of 8%. After \n2019, traffic growth is expected to slow down to 5% per year, reaching 21,350 annual average \ndaily traffic by 2029. The traffic projections consider (i) the growth in traffic during the past 10 \nyears, (ii) the traffic generated by expanded economic activities, (iii) the likelihood that NR319 \ntraffic will be diverted to the expressway once the latter is operational, and (iv) the traffic survey \nresults (Appendix 14).  \n \nB.  Economic Analysis  \n \n50.  The Project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated by comparing the \nproject case with a base case involving the continued use and maintenance of NR319. Without \nthe Project, congestion will worsen, increasing delays, vehicle operating costs, accidents, and \ndeaths. The Project, with the shorter distance and travel time, safer design, and better road \nconditions,  will  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs  and  accident  risks  along  the  corridor.  The \neconomic costs are the cost of capital, which includes physical contingencies, land acquisition, \nand resettlement, and the costs of operating and maintaining the project roads, which include \nreplacing depreciated equipment. The economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating \ncosts resulting from the shorter distance and improved road conditions, (ii) time savings for road \nusers, (iii) savings in road accident costs, and (iv) value-added gains from tourism in the project \narea that are attributable to the Project. The benefits generated from tourism development were \nmeasured by comparing the with project situation to the without project situation.26 The costs \nand benefits of the Project were valued at 2005 economic prices. At 19.1% per year, the EIRR \ndemonstrates the Project\u2019s economic viability, with vehicle operating cost savings accounting for \nmost of the benefits (82%). The benefits of the local road component, while extremely important \nto the villages concerned, constitute a small percentage of the overall project benefits, reflecting \nthe modest traffic levels on local roads. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed the \nrobustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key  variables\u2014construction \ncosts,  traffic  growth,  and  benefits\u2014did  not  significantly  affect  its  viability,  and  the  EIRR \nremained above the threshold of 12% per year. The EIRR was 17.7% for the expressway and \n21.0% for the local road component (Appendix 15). \n \n                                                 \n26 Environmental benefits will also result from reduced vehicle emissions and noise, but these have not been included \nin the analysis for lack of a suitable evaluation methodology. ", "16  \nC.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n \n51.  The assumed toll rates for the project expressway are considered reasonable to attract \nsufficient traffic to meet the criteria for EIRR and financial rate of return (FIRR). Hunan has a toll \npolicy for expressways governed by the Highway Law, with the following criteria: (i) toll levels on \nother  expressways,  (ii)  affordability,  (iii)  advantages  to  the  users  of  the  expressway  and \nalternative roads, (iv) historical and actual traffic flows, and (v) debt service ability. The project \ncompany, in consultation with ADB, will propose the toll rates for the expressway. HCD, the \nHunan  Finance  Department,  and  the  Hunan  Price  Bureau  will  evaluate  the  proposal  and \napprove the toll rates. HCD will consult with ADB about the proposed initial toll rates 6 months \nbefore  the  opening  of  the  expressway.  HCD  and  the  project  company  will  review  the  toll \nannually and monitor actual traffic levels and financial performance. \n \n52.  Financial projections prepared for the expressway in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor the Financial Government and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB \nassessed  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  (Appendix  16).  The  projected  financial \nstatements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to absorb O&M costs, income taxes, \nand debt service. The financial evaluation of the expressway was computed using constant \n2005  prices.  The  Project\u2019s cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were \nconverted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation \nand currency fluctuations. The FIRR for the project expressway is estimated at about 5.5% after \ntaxes.27 This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 2.8%, also net of \ntaxes. The expressway is considered to be both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions (Appendix 17). \n \nD.  Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \n53.  The project area covers one city and four counties, all of which are considered poor by \neither national or provincial standards. Also within the area are 1,381 villages, 600 of which are \npoor. Of the 1.4 million residents in the project area, 965,400 live in rural areas and 387,700 live \nin urban areas. Of the rural population, 343,400 (30.1%) are poor, with an annual per capita \nincome  of  less  than  CNY900.  Of  the  urban  population,  46,200  (11.9%)  are  poor.  The \nexpressway will cut 3 hours off the journey time between Jishou and Chadong. Once linked to \nthe major road network, the improved local roads will facilitate the spread of the expressway\u2019s \nbenefits to the rural economy. Improved transportation will increase income opportunities from \ncash crop farming or seasonal work requiring migration, promote more contact with urban \ncenters, and improve access to markets and social services. \n \n54.  The surveys indicate that the project expressway will directly benefit road users, such as \ntransport providers, bus and truck operators, passengers, traders, government officials, and the \nprivate sector in general. Rural households in the project area are also a beneficiary group. \nFarmers will be in a position to increase their agricultural incomes through better access to \nmarkets, more competitive product and input prices, and cheaper transport costs. They will also \nhave better access to social services and information and increased interaction with the outside \nworld. Migration to nonfarm jobs, an important source of cash income for most rural households, \nwill increase, as the expressway will facilitate movement to other cities and provinces. In relation \nto tourism, Huayuan county is a land of beautiful natural scenery and well-preserved ethnic \nminority traditions. Most of the attractions are in rural areas. In addition Fenghuang, which the \n                                                 \n27 HCD will propose a toll of CNY5 for use of the suspension bridge, which needs to be approved by HPG. The FIRR \nwas estimated assuming a toll of CNY5 for bridge users. ", "  17\nlocal road component will make more accessible, has one of the most beautiful small cities in \nPRC. The Project will therefore boost tourism in the project area, benefiting the poor in Jishou \ncity and Huayuan, Guzhang, and Fenghuang counties (Appendix 18). \n \n55.  Better  roads  enhance  people\u2019s  quality  of  life  by  providing  easier  access  to  social \nservices,  for  instance,  by  encouraging  more  teachers  and  doctors  to  work  in  rural  areas. \nImproved roads cut transport costs and the time needed to travel to a health facility. The health \nimpact will be reflected in lower mortality and morbidity rates. Upgraded roads also increase \npeople\u2019s mobility. However, the construction of the expressway will increase the number of truck \nand bus drivers passing through communities, putting the residents at higher risk of acquiring \nsexually  transmitted  infections,  including  HIV/AIDS.  The  Center  for Disease  Control  of  the \nHunan Provincial Health Department implements preventive measures and adopts tight health \nand  hygiene  standards.  Such  measures  include  providing  education  programs,  distributing \ncondoms to local residents, and monitoring any outbreaks and spread of disease. The center \nconducts regular inspections on construction sites to control sexually transmitted infections and \nmaintain high standards of hygiene.28 To reduce the risk of HIV/AIDS infection from the Project, \nthe center will introduce preventive measures at the construction sites and catchment area. Its \nservices include voluntary counseling and testing kits and education. In carrying out the civil \nworks contracts, the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Epidemic Disease will be followed. \nTargeted and broadly based advocacy and awareness programs will also be carried out in the \nproject area.29 \n \n56.  About  77%  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  is  composed  of  ethnic  minorities, \npredominantly Miao and Tujia (98% of the minorities). Around 60% of the ethnic population will \nbenefit from the Project. An ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP) was prepared based on \nthe Resettlement Plan and ongoing government policies and programs for ethnic minorities. The \nEMDP  contains  the  necessary  measures,  such  as  income  enhancement,  to  mitigate  the \nProject\u2019s adverse impacts and ensure that its benefits flow directly to the ethnic minorities. The \nmain issue to be tackled will be land acquisition and resettlement. About 84% of the people \naffected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  minorities.  Such  impacts  and  the \ncorresponding mitigating measures are also addressed in the Resettlement Plan. HCD has \nfinalized the EMDP based on feedback from Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture, relevant county \nand township level officials, and ADB. A summary of the EMDP is in Appendix 19. \n \n57.  The Project will give women greater access to information and jobs. Female migrant \nworkers in search of work will find it easier to travel to distant provinces on the expressway. In \nrelation to agriculture, women will also derive advantages from the Project, especially because it \nis they who handle most of the farm work. In addition, women will benefit from increased \nmarketing opportunities (most fruit and vegetable sellers in local markets are women) and from \nbetter access to education and health facilities. The Project will enhance women\u2019s participation \nin planning and project monitoring and evaluation and in the implementation of other poverty \nreduction programs, particularly in the villages served by the local road component. Women are \n                                                 \n28 In addition, HPG established the Hunan Provincial AIDS Prevention and Control Committee, which includes \nofficials from 32 provincial departments and 7 prefecture governments, to prevent outbreaks of the disease and \neffectively control its spread. To date, 7 cases have been found in the project area and 1,249 cases have been \nfound in the province since 1995. \n29 HCD will ensure that contractors disseminate information on the risks of sexually transmitted infections and \nHIV/AIDS to their employees during project implementation, a requirement that will be included in the contract. \nLocal public health offices will disseminate similar information to ethnic minorities, transport operators, and women \nin the project area in accordance with ongoing HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. ", "18  \nentitled  to  equal  opportunity  and  pay  in  jobs  under  the  PRC  Labor  Law  and  will  receive \npreferential treatment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. \n \nE.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n58.  The  Resettlement  Plan  was  prepared  based  on  the  preliminary  design;  39  village \nsurveys;  403  household  surveys;  local  government  statistics;  and  consultations  with  local \nofficials,  village  leaders,  and  affected  households.  The  expressway  will  directly  affect  10 \ntownships and 39 villages in Jishou city and Huayuan county. In the 39 villages, minority \nnationalities account for 84% of the population (Miao 74% and Tujia, 10%). About 351 hectares \nof land will be permanently acquired, affecting 9,000 people, of which 32% is paddy, 19% is dry \nland, 3% is land used to grow vegetable and orchards, and 44% is forestland. About 115 \nhectares of land will be temporarily used during the construction phase. Farmland acquisition \nwill displace 3,105 people. Some 27,500 square meters of brick and wood houses and other \nstructures will also be demolished, displacing 973 people. \n \n59.  The Resettlement Plan was formulated in accordance with the PRC\u2019s laws and local \nregulations and with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous People\u2019s Policy. \nThe impact on the villages is modest; however, because 10-15% of the affected households are \npoor, special measures will be taken to assist vulnerable and other households at risk. Land \nacquisition will be completed by April 2006. House relocation will be completed ahead of time at \na site within villages and just a short distance from the original area of residence. Compensation \nwill be paid prior to the displacement of people or loss of land and will be invested in economic \nand social infrastructure so that farmers\u2019 livelihoods and living standards will improve. Economic \nrehabilitation strategies have been discussed with the 10 most seriously affected villages. The \npreliminary estimate for resettlement costs is $32 million. A resettlement information booklet \nwas distributed to the affected villages and households in June 2005 and the Resettlement Plan \nwas  uploaded  on  the  ADB  web  site  in  October  2005.  Based  on  the  detailed  design,  the \nResettlement Plan is to be updated and sent to ADB for approval by December 2005. The \nsummary Resettlement Plan is included in Appendix 20. \n \nF.  Environmental Assessment \n \n60.  ADB has classified the Project as environmental category A. The environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) report was prepared by HCD, under the supervision of HEPB, and was \napproved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  in  May  2005.30 The  EIA \nassessed the environmental impacts of the selected alignment of the expressway and the local \nroad components and prescribed environmental protection and mitigation measures costing \n$5.8 million.31 The proposed alignment does not cross or impinge on any protected areas; there \nare no known rare or endangered species in the project area. The Project\u2019s major environmental \nimpacts include soil and water conservation and erosion control. A soil erosion prevention plan \nwas prepared separately from the EIA. To ensure that all potential adverse environmental \nimpacts of the Project are mitigated, HCD will implement the environmental management plan. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding  documents  and \ncontracts for civil works. \n                                                 \n30 The EIA for the stretch of the expressway between the sections of the Hunan Roads Development II and III \nprojects was prepared as part of the EIA for the whole section from Changde to Huaihua during the preparation of \nthe Hunan Roads Development Project II. It was approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration in \nNovember 2003. Approval of the EIA for the Chongqing section of the corridor is expected by 2005. \n31 A summary EIA was circulated to the ADB Board on 27 May 2005 and placed on the ADB web site on 31 May \n2005. The Chinese version of the EIA was sent to the Project\u2019s field offices. ", "  19\nG.  Risks \n \n61.  The Project has been designed to reduce potential technical, economic, financial, and \nsocial risks. The main technical risks are associated with the construction of a large suspension \nbridge  and  the  13  tunnels.  To  minimize  the  risks,  international  consultants  reviewed  the \nproposed design and construction methods. The prequalification of contractors will focus on \ntheir  financial  and  technical  capabilities  in  handling  similar  works.  During  the  construction \nperiod,  monitoring  and  contract  management  information  systems  will  be  set  up  and \nimplemented, with the assistance of the international consultants, for timely identification of \ntechnical problems and implementation of corrective measures. HCD has a proven track record \nand satisfactory performance in implementing internationally financed projects. The financial risk \nassociated with the construction and operation of the expressway will depend on the actual level \nand composition of traffic, the construction costs, the ability of the commercial management, \nand  the  tolls  charged.  To  control  the  financial  risks,  the  project  company  will  create  a \ncommercial business environment for expressway operations and the central and provincial \ngovernments will inject substantial equity into the project expressway. The social risks include \nresettlement,  HIV/AIDS  infection,  and  impacts  on  ethnic  minority  communities.  Appropriate \nmitigation measures are in place in the Resettlement Plan and EMDP. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n62.

The road network in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) was 1.86 million kilometers \n(km) long in 2004, an increase of 46,000 km from its length 2003. Of this, 1.52 million km were \nclassified. Class II and above roads accounted for 299,524 km, or 19.7% of the total length. The \nroad density increased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km2) in 1995 to 19.4 km per 100 km2 \nin 2004. In 2004, rural roads totaled 2.9 million km in 2004: 479,372 km are county roads; \n945,180 km are township roads, and 1,473,534 km are village roads. Hunan\u2019s road network \naccounted for 4.7% of the country\u2019s total, with a length of 85,233 km. Of this, 39,691 km (46.6 \n%) were classified: 1,218 km of expressways (1.4%), 469 km of class I roads (0.6%), and 5,174 \nkm of class II roads (6.1%).The road density in Hunan was 40.3 km per 100 km2 in 2004, \ncompared to the average of 51.6 km per 100 km2 for the eastern and coastal provinces. \n \n2.  In 2003, the PRC\u2019s vehicle fleet totaled 24 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 72 million \nother motorized vehicles. The privately owned fleet of motor vehicles increased from 0.3 million \nin 1985 to 12.0 million in 2003. Modernization of the vehicle fleet will improve vehicle safety and \nreduce individual vehicles\u2019 fuel consumption and emissions. In 2004, Hunan had more than \n43,000 bus operators, most of them small, private operators on routes shorter than 150 km. \nAbout 72,000 buses were registered, including 41,500 large buses with a total capacity of \n816,200 seats, with average growth of 5.2% over the last 10 years. Road passenger traffic in \nHunan, measured in terms of passenger-km, grew 6.4% per year between 1990 and 2004, \nslower than the national average of 8.6%. Road freight traffic, in ton-km, grew at 9.7% per year, \ncompared with 3.3% per year for the PRC as a whole.  \n \n3.  The Hunan Provincial Communications Department is responsible for regulating the road \ntransport industry in Hunan by licensing drivers, vehicles, and intercity bus services. Freight \ntransport is essentially deregulated; however, interprovincial bus routes require MOC approval. \nPrivate operations have increased, resulting in improved transport efficiency and quality of \nservices and increased competition. Road transport tariffs are allowed within a range of plus or \nminus 20% of advisory tariffs set by the local government. This flexibility, coupled with ease of \nmarket entry, will facilitate the passing on to transport users of cost reductions resulting from \nimproved road conditions. \n \n4.  Expenditures  for  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges, \ngovernment grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and foreign loans and investments. Two \ndedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and the vehicle purchase fee, have provided \nmuch of the financing for the road sector. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996\u20132000), the \nroad maintenance fee and vehicle purchase fee provided 53% and 13%, respectively, of total \nroad investments. The vehicle purchase fee was replaced by the vehicle purchase tax in 2001.  \n \n5.  Road  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \nprefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the designs of high-standard roads and associated \nstructures. Design institutes are staffed with well-qualified personnel. City and county highway \nbureaus have their own construction units to carry out minor projects within their administrative \ndistricts. Competitive bidding practices were mandated by the 1999 Tendering and Bidding Law. \nRoad maintenance is well organized and implemented by expressway companies and highway \nadministration bureaus.  \n \n6.  The Asian Development Bank has been undertaking policy dialogue on the PRC road \nsector since 1991. The principal issues addressed include the impact of road projects on \npoverty, highway design standards, construction quality, road safety, vehicle emissions, pricing \npolicies, commercialization and corporatization, and nongovernment financial resources.

General \n \n1.  Transport services are relatively well developed along NR319 in Jishou city, the capital \nof  Xiangxi  Autonomous  Prefecture,  but  less  so  along  the  local  road  component  in  poor, \nmountainous,  and  underdeveloped  areas  in  Baojing,  Guzhang,  Fenghuang,  and  Huayuan \ncounties. While there is a class II bus terminal in Jishou city, more than 80% of townships in the \narea do not have even class V rural bus stations. Further many villages and townships have no \ndirect access to bus service as operators are either reluctant to venture onto poor-quality roads \nor are not permitted to do so for safety reasons. Hunan transport administration division does \nnot issue licenses to operate bus routes on unsafe roads. \n \n2.  It is operators who propose new bus routes, and local transport administration divisions \ndo not undertake overall planning for the route network. The fares and routes of the formal bus \nsystem are regulated, which often results in inefficient services. Thus villagers have to rely on \ninformal  means  of  transport,  such  as  baby-taxis,  motorized\u2013tricycles,  and  dual-purpose \nvehicles. Because informal transport services of local operators are limited to the routes plying \nvillages and townships and/or local markets, it has limitation to replace the formal transport \nsystem. \n \nB.  Demand for Transport Services \n \n3.  In the project area, although trucks and buses provide services to villages, the cost of \ntravel is high. The people in the area thus mostly rely on informal transport services to travel to a \ntown. The TA survey found that the average trip for the poor was longer than that for the non-\npoor because villages are far away from commercial centers. Such trips are costly for the poor \nand hence infrequent. As a result, the poor who are often limited to walking to nearby rotating \nvillage markets can sell their produce up to the amount that they can carry on their backs, or sell \nit to four-wheel drive-in traders who benefit through a buyer\u2019s market situation. Likewise, the \npoor are comparatively limited in traveling to buy farming inputs.  \n \n4.  Most trips cover short distances: approximately 60% of all trips are to the nearest town \nand 33% are within the township. Trips to the county town are rare, with the average household \nmaking only 12 trips per year and the poorest group making less than two trips. The demand for \nlong-distance travel is limited to migrant workers, who are employed in the coastal provinces \nand return home once a year. Most trips are for buying necessities, while only 16% are for \nagricultural marketing. Walking and bicycling are the major modes of transport for short-distance \ntrips. As distance increases, so does the number of motorized trips: almost no trips are made on \nfoot when the distance exceeds 6 kilometers. Indeed, even for extremely short journeys, a \nsignificant proportion of the population uses motorized transport. Vehicle ownership is low in the \nproject area. According to the survey, the non-poor own an average of three vehicles per 100 \nhouseholds compared with none for both the poor and absolute poor. The non-poor also own an \naverage of eight motorcycles per 100 households, compared with four for the poor. \n \nC.  Transport Services and Road Condition \n \n5.  The area\u2019s inadequate and insufficient transport services are highly correlated with poor \nroad  conditions  in  the  area.  The  TA  survey  revealed  that  transport  services  are  more \nextensively available in areas with better roads, which makes travel to markets or social facilities \neasier and undertaken more frequently. In Jishou, where the road network is in better condition \nthan in other places in the project area, transport services are relatively well developed. This ", "32  Appendix 4 \nimplied that transport services improve with the improvement of the road network. The operators \nwho were interviewed confirmed their willingness to extend transport services where this would \nbe profitable, and villagers who have experienced road upgrading have also confirmed that bus \nservices were indeed extended after a road was upgraded. When roads are upgraded, transport \nservices improve shortly thereafter and the frequency of villagers\u2019 trips to local markets, nearby \ntownships, and towns increases significantly. The village survey also confirmed a close link \nbetween road access and the quality of transport service.  \n \n6.  The villagers surveyed said that when roads were improved the quality of service did get \nbetter, while official fares and trucking rates did not decrease since licensed bus operators were \noften constrained in setting fares. In many cases, on the other hand, informal transport fares \nwent down. The informal operators are based in townships and villages, and their fares are \nusually negotiable, tending to decrease when roads are improved.  \n \n7.  The responses to the survey did not cite unaffordable transport services and insufficient \ncredit as serious obstacles to changes in agricultural practices and a shift to nonagricultural \nbusinesses. Indeed, even the poor use vehicular transport for 30% of their trips. They viewed \npoor roads to be a key reason for inadequate and expensive transport services and infrequent \nvisits from extension officers, veterinarians, health workers, and public servants. Thus improved \nlocal roads will thus spur both formal and informal transport service providers to render better \ntransport services.  \n \n8.  The demand for travel also increases significantly with improved roads mainly because \nof upgraded transport services, which eventually helps raise rural incomes and reduce poverty. \nThe village survey indicated that the average number of trips in such areas is higher than in \nareas with less developed roads. \n \n9.  The interviews with villagers and county officials suggest that rural poor farmers who \nrarely use roads also benefit from improved transport services by way of higher farm-gate prices \nfor their cash crops and more frequent visits from extension and health personnel and public \nservants and officials.   \n \nD.  Efforts to Expand the Provision of Transport Services \n \n10.  Expanding access to transport services is an integral part of Hunan\u2019s plan for transport \nservices. Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture,1 where the Project is located, has only one class II \nbus terminal in Jishou city, and more than 80% of townships do not have even rural bus \nstations.  To  enhance  the  sustainable  delivery  of  transport  services,  the  prefecture  has \nimplemented a plan to construct class I\u2013IV bus terminals.2 A class I bus terminal is being \nconstructed in Jishou and is scheduled to open in 2006. The construction of class II bus \nterminals in five counties is also under way and at least one class II bus terminal will be built in \neach of the three remaining counties during the period of the 11th FYP. The prefecture aims to \nbuild a class V rural bus station in each village by 2015, 15 of which will be completed in the \nproject area by 2007. HCD agreed to implement these facilities in tandem with the Project to \nensure the efficient provision of transport services when the project roads have been built. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The prefecture comprises 8 counties, 218 townships, and 2,664 villages. \n2  A bus terminal is classified according to its daily passenger handling capacity. A class I terminal handles more than \n10,000 passengers per day, a class II terminal handles 5,000 to 10,000 passengers, and a class V terminal \nhandles up to 500 passengers. ", "    Appendix 5 33\n     \nSMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROJECT AREA \n \n1.  The basic parameters for small business development are in place in the project area: \nliteracy is reasonably high; even though most people are engaged in farming, a labor force is \nalso available for commercially-oriented nonfarm activities;1 and secondary and tertiary markets \nexist. Microfinance schemes are in place for supporting small businesses under provincial \npoverty programs or minority development programs. Various poverty reduction projects also \nsupport the development of small businesses, including two externally funded projects, one \nfunded by the World Food Programme and International Fund for Agricultural Development\u2019s \nAgricultural Development Project and one by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation\u2019s \nPoverty Reduction Project. The existing programs complement each other and will provide a \ngood  basis  for  promoting  small  business  development  in  the  area  through  their  focus  on \nagricultural diversification for commercial purposes, construction of market facilities, and skills \nfor self-employment. \n \n2.  Small businesses are fairly active in the project area. With improved roads, existing \nenterprises are expected to further expand their businesses. Each kilometer of road averages \nfour businesses, and one of the local roads under the Project has about six businesses per \nkilometer. A wide assortment of businesses has been established that provide basic necessities \nfor local communities and travelers. The technical assistance (TA) survey shows that the trend \nevinces an inherent entrepreneurial spirit among local residents who, if given the opportunity, \nare likely to set up commercial enterprises. A number of factories are located along NR319, an \nindication that the proposed expressway may attract larger commercial establishments to the \nvicinity. \n \n3.  Small businesses could focus on the following areas: (i) agriculture and agro-industry, (ii) \nherbal medicines and handicrafts; (iii) community-based tourism, eco-tourism, and cultural and \nheritage tourism based on the traditions of the ethnic minorities; (iv) service industries, such as \nservices  for  through  traffic;  and  (v)  community-based  distribution  facilities  and  transport \nsystems. The TA survey indicate that inadequate road infrastructure has been one of major \nbarriers to developing small businesses in the area. \n \n4.  During the  TA, a strategy was prepared to develop small businesses and commercial \nactivities that includes (i) developing community-based enterprises such as gas stations, niche \nfarming,  eco-tourism  and  community-based  tourism,  herbal  and  homeopathic  medicines, \nhandicraft centers, hostels, and restaurants; (ii) building roadside stations as focal points for \nsmall  business  development;  (iii)  creating  economic  zones  specifically  targeting  small \nbusinesses, which require government interventions to, for example, locate and group similar \ntypes of businesses; and (iv) creating an ethnic minority cultural zone, which would give local \ncommunities opportunities to display their cultures and traditions in a designated area as well as \nallow them to develop their entrepreneurial activities. \n \n5.  The TA also indicated that assistance is needed to channel local people into potential \nareas of business and commercial opportunities, such as entrepreneurial training that would \nmake investments attractive. The Hunan Communications Provincial Department has ensured \nthat such assistance will be provided through provincial poverty reduction programs. \n                                                 \n1 Underemployment is significant during the nonfarm season. ", "34  Appendix 6 \nROAD SAFETY AND VEHICLE EMISSIONS \n \n1.  Implementation of the Government's economic reform policies since 1978 has resulted \nin rapid economic growth and a persistent increase of the number of vehicles. The People\u2019s \nRepublic of China will continue to experience a high rate of motor vehicle growth for many years \nto come. As such, the country is facing increasingly serious road safety and vehicle emissions \nproblems, which inhibit economic and social development given their association with millions of \npremature deaths and injuries, high medical costs, strain on welfare services, and reduced \nproductivity. Many of the problems encountered with road safety and vehicle emissions are \npredominantly  institutional  in  nature,  resulting  from  fragmentation  of  responsibility,  lack  of \ninterdepartmental coordination, inadequate data systems and monitoring, inadequate action \nplans and integrated strategies, inadequate enforcement and legislation, lack of road safety \naudits and accident black spot programs, weak vehicle inspection systems, and shortages of \nskilled staff and resources.   \n \nA.  Road Safety \n2.  Accident rates in the People\u2019s Republic of China are high compared with those in highly \nmotorized countries and in many other developing countries. Road accidents and their resultant \neconomic losses represent a substantial problem and require urgent attention by the authorities. \nAccording to national statistics,1 in 2004 road traffic accidents resulted in 107,077 deaths and \n460,864 injuries, with costs equivalent to 1\u20133% of gross domestic product. In Hunan in 2004, \nthere were 16,116 accidents that killed 3,825 people and injured 18,377. To address the issue \nof road safety, the Ministry of Public Security prepared the 2004 Road Safety Action Plan, \nwhose primary aims are to (i) reduce serious accidents (involving more than 10 fatalities), (ii) \neliminate major accidents (involving 30 or more fatalities), and (iii) facilitate implementation of \nthe 2004 Road Safety Law. This is to be achieved through improved vehicle safety, driver \ntraining, and improved traffic management. In Hunan, the traffic police, which fall under the \nauspices of the Hunan Public Security Bureau, are responsible for promoting road safety, \nenforcing traffic laws, and identifying preventive measures and accident black spots. This work \nis coordinated with the Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HCD) to consolidate \ninteragency efforts.  \n \n3.  Safety is one of the major factors that must be taken into consideration, along with, for \nexample,  mobility and economic and environmental impacts, in order to achieve balanced \ndesign standards for roads. The design of the expressway was chosen to ensure that posted \n(legal) speed limits are attainable with an adequate margin of safety. In this respect, careful \nattention was given to the design of super-elevation on curves, overtaking and curve sight \ndistances, deceleration lanes at interchanges and service areas, and adequate road camber to \nensure that surface water runs off the road surface during heavy rainfalls.  \n \n4.  Controlling the overloading of vehicles is essential. With heavily loaded vehicles, road \nsafety is affected because of the higher demands placed on vehicles\u2019 braking systems, chassis \nstrength,  and  flexibility;  vehicles\u2019  stability  when  rounding  curves;  and  steering  difficulties \nresulting from heavy rear-end loads reducing front-end weight, road contact, and friction with the \nroad  surface.  HCD  will  monitor  operations  in  relation  to  overloaded  vehicles  and  impose \nsufficient penalties on offenders to help reduce the risk of traffic accidents, pavement damage, \nand maintenance costs. An efficient penalty system will be in place to discourage operators \nfrom  overloading.  Typical  penalties  could  include  (i)  the  suspension  of  operators\u2019  driver\u2019s \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Public Security. 2004 accidents statistics.  ", "Appendix 6  35\nlicenses,  (ii)  the  suspension  of  operators\u2019  goods  licenses,  (iii)  a  large  fine,  and  (iv)  the \nrequirement that operators unload their vehicles and reload only to the allowable weight limit. \nHCD is currently using the Handbook for Road Safety Audits2, which was developed under \nWorld Bank Highway Project in 2000. All road design and operation processes are subject to \nthis road safety audit. Construction of the proposed expressway to a high standard will reduce \naccidents in the Jishou\u2013Chadong corridor. \n \n5.  An interdepartmental framework will be established under the Project to enhance road \nsafety in the project area. While HCD will concentrate on engineering, road safety audits, black \nspot improvement, and operational issues pertaining to the expressway, the Hunan Public \nSecurity Bureau will deal with traffic law enforcement issues to create safer roads.  \n \n6.  HCD will help develop a comprehensive road safety strategy in the project area in \ncollaboration with the international road safety specialist. The strategy will seek to promote \ninnovative ways to improve road safety by means of the following broadly based approach: (i) \ninstitutional  strengthening  to  strengthen  the  provincial  road  safety  committee,  develop \ncomprehensive  action  programs,  promote  awareness,  set  effective  targets,  and  undertake \nmonitoring; (ii) capacity building and human resources development to set up an efficient and \nuniform database and upgrade skills and knowledge; (iii) coordination to develop black spot \nprograms, undertake accident prevention measures, foster the dissemination of knowledge \nabout best practices, and set common targets and time frames; and (iv) promotion of effective \ncooperation  among  government  and  nongovernment  organizations,  the  private  sector,  and \ncommunity groups. \n \nB.  Vehicle Emissions \n \n7.  Motor vehicle emissions are increasingly contributing to air pollution. The Government is \ntaking significant measures to control emissions by regulating the automobile industry and \nenforcing an annual vehicle test and inspection and maintenance program. The new measures \nalso set emissions and fuel efficiency targets and offer tax incentives for manufacturers of more \nenvironment-friendly cars. One aim is to reduce average fuel consumption by 15 percentage \npoints between 2003 and 2010. Hunan is developing alternative fuels that could help reduce \npetroleum imports. A 300,000 ton per year ethanol plant has been proposed in Changde that \nwould use corn and other grains as feedstock. The Sichuan\u2013Hunan gas pipeline project is \ncurrently under construction. Natural gas will be provided for power generation, industrial fuel, \ncommercial and residential users, and transport. HCD and the Hunan Environmental Protection \nBureau (HEPB) are working on a plan to control vehicle emissions. Implementing such a plan \nwill require the cooperation of a number of agencies, jurisdictions, and the community as well as \ngovernment commitment. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the expressway, HCD will \nprovide ADB with the latest government plan to improve air quality in Hunan, including cleaner \nfuel programs. With the assistance of consultants, HCD and HEPB will develop an action plan to \ncontrol vehicle emissions in the area and implement it accordingly. \n \n8.  The Project will have positive impacts on air pollution, as emissions from vehicles along \nthe project roads are expected to be lower because of better traffic flows as a result of improved \nroad conditions. Upon completion of the Project, sulfur dioxide emissions from vehicles on the \nproject roads are estimated to be 20% lower than before the Project. Likewise, nitrogen oxides \nemissions will be 12% lower than before the Project and carbon dioxide emissions will be 20% \nlower. \n                                                 \n2  ISBN 7-114-03743-0 published in October 2000.

Hunan  Provincial  Highways  Administration  Bureau  (HHAB)  is  responsible  for  the \nmanagement,  construction,  improvement,  and  maintenance  of  all  roads  apart  from \nexpressways. For national, provincial and county roads (up to Class II highways), HHAB carries \nout maintenance of the roads. However, for county (Class III highways and below) and township \nroads,  HHAB  delegates  maintenance  to  county  and  township  authorities:  for  county  and \ntownship roads the county is responsible for maintenance, while for town and village roads the \nlocal traffic administration bureau is responsible. \n \n2.  Although  general  administration  of  the  local  road  network  remains  with  Xiangxi \nPrefecture, maintenance  and  management  of  the  road network  is the  responsibility  of  the \ncounties within the prefecture. Most road maintenance funds are used to maintain roads that are \nclass III or above. Maintenance of unclassified roads (72% of the network) is carried out by local \npeople using their own resources. Counties finance about 50% of their road maintenance \nrequirements. In the prefecture, there are approximately 9,575 kilometers (km) of roads, of \nwhich 6,900 km are unclassified.1 About 298 staff are involved in maintenance, and 759 farmers \nare paid CNY150 per month for part-time maintenance work.

", "Appendix 7  37\nB.  Issues and Problems \n \n4.  Adequate  maintenance  is  crucial  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rural  roads.  Local \nadministrative units are responsible for such maintenance but the quality of rural roads does not \nseem to be systematically monitored by the higher authorities. There is no comprehensive \nplanning for rehabilitation. Maintenance planning often hinges on a subjective assessment, \nmainly because of the local government\u2019s inability to maintain its road networks because of lack \nof resources. Between counties, there seems to be little cross-dissemination of knowledge to \nmeasure performance. While local authorities draft plans for routine maintenance work, periodic \nmaintenance is rather budget-driven and lacks a systematic, preventive approach.  \n \n5.  There is no official funding channel for the maintenance of township or village roads or \nsystem to enable provincial or central government to fund the development of rural roads. A \nreliable funding mechanism for maintaining and rehabilitating rural roads must be designed, with \nattractive incentives (including financial incentives) to help local governments to maintain their \nroads. Since funds for maintenance are limited, a simple evaluation and prioritization method for \nmaintenance work must also be established to streamline work programming and make the \nmost effective use of funds. \n \n6.  Apart  from  financial  constraints,  local  governments\u2019  maintenance  efforts  are  often \nhampered by a lack of qualified technical and managerial personnel, training resources, and \nequipment. Local governments must develop a capacity to contract out road maintenance. In \ntandem, start-up assistance must be extended to local road maintenance contractors in rural \nareas, and ways to generate employment for the rural poor must be identified. A suitable \nperformance monitoring system must be put in place. \n \nC.  Recommendation \n \n7.  During project preparation, an action plan (Table A7.4) was established to strengthen \nlocal road maintenance. The action plan was agreed with Hunan Provincial Communications \nDepartment  (HCD).  Following  the  plan,  HCD  will  develop  and  implement  a  sound  road \nmaintenance  management  system  during  project  implementation.  The  system  will  have  (i) \nmeasures  that  minimize  maintenance  costs;  (ii) a  modern  method  of  evaluation  and \nmaintenance prioritization for efficient work programming and fund use; (iii) a compilation of \nroad inventories, together with basic data on the condition of the roads; and (iv) a monitoring \nsystem  to  be  used  by  local  residents.  HCD  will  encourage  county  governments  to  adopt \ncompetitive bidding among maintenance contractors to enhance efficiency. A training program \nwill be provided under the Project to strengthen the capacity of local government maintenance \nunits. \n \nTable A7.4: Action Plan \nActivity   Requirements  \nClassified Roads  Develop a functional classification for the road system \n  Determine the importance of each road in the overall road network \nEstablish a road condition system \nDevelop road maintenance work priorities \nAssign a cost for each activity and define overall cost \nBridges  Carry out the same process for the maintenance of bridges \nUnclassified Roads  Provide basic funding and technical advice to help maintenance of unclassified roads \n  Provide basic materials to the small communities  \nCapacity Building  Assign the Communications College to carry out capacity building and on-going \ntraining to enhance local capacity \nFund  Optimize the maintenance fund, and ensure the sustainability of the road networks \nSource: TA consultants estimates.

Flow of Project Benefits \n \n1.  The  construction  of  the  expressway  and  the  improvement  of  local  roads  will  lower \ntransport costs and reduce travel time and thus, once completed, the Project will improve the \nquality of transport services. Better road infrastructure and services will encourage villagers to \ngo to markets, use educational and health facilities more frequently, and avail themselves of \nincreased agricultural extension services. These benefits, which accrue directly to road users, \nare the Project\u2019s direct effects. \n \n2.  Over  time,  improved  road  access  will  expand  economic  activities  in  the  area  and \ngradually lead to structural changes in production and consumption patterns and in the labor \nmarket. Lower transport costs reduce the costs of traded farm inputs, thereby raising agricultural \nproductivity and profitability. Cropping patterns change with better roads, as farmers shift to \nhigher-value crops because of easier access to markets and new farming technologies. Road \nimprovement helps increase nonfarm job opportunities and the potential for increased wages. \nBetter roads reduce transaction time and costs, thereby spurring commercial activities. In turn, \nhigher incomes boost local people\u2019s demand for transport and the movement of local goods and \nservices. These are the benefits that trickle down to local people over time. Even the rural poor \nwho rarely use roads also benefit from improved roads through more and cheaper goods and \nservices and increased economic opportunities. These are the Project\u2019s indirect effects.  \n \nB.  Monitoring Framework \n \n3.  Based on the findings of an ADB technical assistance, a standard monitoring framework \nand a set of monitoring indicators were designed to measure the actual benefits definitely (Table \nA13.1). These indicators were chosen in a way to assess the hypothesized flow of project \nbenefits (paras. 1\u20132). \n \nTable A13.1: Monitoring Framework: Indicators and Mechanism \n \nTiming of Benefits or Outcomes  Monitoring Indicators  Monitoring Mechanism \nA.

Monitoring will focus on a few representative communities in the project area, a useful \nexercise in accumulating knowledge on how benefits flow to local people. Because this pilot \napproach will greatly narrow down the scope of monitoring, local authorities are expected to \nundertake adequate monitoring more readily. During project preparation, three villages in three \ntownships in Huayuan county were selected as the pilot sites: Shaping village (Malichang \ntownship), Jisi village (Jiwei township), and Nongke village (Daheping). \n \nC.  Implementation of Monitoring \n \n5.  The  Hunan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HCD)  concurred  with  the \nmonitoring framework and the set of indicators for monitoring the Project\u2019s performance. During \nproject preparation, the baseline values for the indicators were specified to the extent available \n(Table  A13.2)  and  will  be  further  updated  by  HCD,  where  necessary.  HCD  and  local \ngovernments have ensured that monitoring in the selected communities will be adequate. HCD \nwill measure the indicators for project evaluation on project inception, completion, and biennially \nfor 5 years after completion. HCD will hire an independent, qualified institute for 24 person-\nmonths for surveys, analysis, and reporting. The preliminary estimate for the cost of monitoring \nis $120,000. Reports summarizing the key findings of monitoring will be submitted to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. \n \nTable A13.2: Baseline Data of the Monitoring Indicators \n \nMalichang Township  Jiwei Township  Daheping Township \nBaseline Data/Indicators \nTS  Shaping  HH  TS  Jisi   HH  TS  Nongke  HH \nDistance to township center    2      1.5      0.5   \nIncreased traffic volumes along the corridor                   \nBus and freight fares                   \nVillages with bus services (%)   39      40      10     \nBus frequency to county center (buses/day)  many      4      6     \nFertilizer input (%)      14.1      8.1      18.6 \nVehicle ownership \n  (vehicles/1,000 people)  11.7  8.3     4.3  6.7     10.9  18.5   \nTransport expenses (%)      6.6      4.6      4.7 \nFrequency of visits to county markets                   \nFrequency of visits to township marketsa     3      5      5   \nDropout rates from middle school (boys, girls)                  \nFrequency of visits by doctors \n  (number per 6 months)                   \nIncome from nonfarm sector (%)      32      9      72 \nNumber of nonfarm enterprises                   \nIncome from tourism (restaur\u2019ts, etc.)                   \nNumber of tourists                   \nCash crops  \nOrchards (mu/person)  0.1    0.39  0.13  0.64  0.58  1.07  0.71  0.58 \nVegetables (percentage of arable area)  14.5      14.7      34     \nFrequency of visits by agricultural technicians\n(no. per 6 months)    2      4      11   \nNo. of new or renovated houses (%)    6.2      6.1      6.9   \nRural income (CNY) per year  1,279  1,124    1,266  1,290    1,213  1,140   \nPoverty rate (%)  34.1  36     40.1  34     44.1  24   \nHH = household, No. = number, restaur\u2019ts = restaurants, TS = township. \na time/household/month. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates; and ADB. 2004.

The 64-kilometer (km) expressway is a section of the Changsha-Chongqing corridor, \none the eight high-priority western corridors in the 10th Five-Year Plan. It connects cities of \nJishou and Chadong in west Hunan with Changsha (capital of Hunan) to the east, Hubei to the \nnorth, Chongqing Municipality and Sichuan to the north-west and Guizhou to the west. With the \ncompletion of this Project, the Changsha-Chongqing corridor will become a major artery for the \nregional  transport  network,  connecting  with  national  and  provincial  roads.  The  project \nexpressway will be built in parallel to national road (NR319), a combination of class II, III, IV \nroads. NR 319 has pavement in poor condition over roughly 60% of its length with steep slopes \nand sharp turns, and suffers from frequent flooding and intrusions by nonmotorized traffic. \nCongestion along NR 319 is a daily phenomenon due to booming mining and agricultural \nprocessing industries. Two local roads are the 86 km Xiatou section in Huayaun county and the \n43 km Qianxi section in Baojing county. The Xiatuo section, a major north-south road in rural \nareas with heavy traffic and commercial activities, will connect an interchange of the project \nexpressway. The Qianxi section, through NR 209, provides a short-cut from the mining and \nindustrial areas in Baojing and Huayuan counties to a railway station in Guzhang county. \n \n2.  Traffic count surveys were undertaken in December 2004 during the TA for both the \nexpressway and local roads components to refine the origin-destination (O-D) surveys carried \nout in 2002 under the feasibility study. Forty eight-hour classified traffic counts were done at key \nlocations along the NR319 and the two local roads. Forecast passenger and freight vehicle O-D \nmatrices for several years were developed from the 2004 base year matrices by applying \nprojections of gross domestic product (GDP) and estimated elasticities of transport demand with \nrespect to GDP growth. In the first few years, trips are predicted to grow at around 9%. \n \n3.  Based on forecast economic growth in the project area as well as historical trends in \ntraffic  growth,  the  traffic  projections  were  developed  which  also  take  account  of  potential \ngenerated and diverted traffic as a result of: (i) the additional traffic generated by the Project \nthrough enhanced development opportunities; (ii) traffic diverted from the rail network in the \nproject area; and (iii) potential diversion of traffic as a result of tolling of the expressway. A \nproportion of diverted traffic from railway was assumed at 1% for passenger and 2% for freight. \n \n4.  The Project will increase the corridor\u2019s capacity to meet the demand for transport and \nwill  reduce  transport  costs,  travel  times,  and  accident  rates.  It  will  provide  employment \nopportunities  both  during  the  construction  period  and  thereafter  and  will  be  a  conduit  for \nincreased economic growth and improved incomes. The local roads component will help ensure \nthat these benefits reach the poorest communities. Traffic on the expressway is forecast to grow \nfrom 6,000 to 12,650 average annual daily traffic in 2010, when the expressway will open, to \n11,500 to 14,000 in 2019 and 17,000 to 21,350 by 2029. On the project local roads, traffic is \nforecast to grow from between 1,600 and 2,000 average annual daily traffic in 2010 to 2,500 to \n3,000 in 2019 and 3,900 to 4,200 in 2029 (Table A14).  \n \nTable A14: Traffic Forecast, Average Annual Daily Traffic, Selected Years \n \nYear  Expressway  NR319  Local Road 1  Local Road 2 \n2009  6,000  2,392  1,970  1,603 \n2014  8,527  2,643  2,305  1,875 \n2019  12,645  2,904  2,941  2,509 \n2024  16,743  3,547  3,578  3,203 \n2029  21,345  4,317  4,148  3,896 \nSources: Feasibility Study and TA consultants estimates. \n ", "Appendix 15  47\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The proposed project comprises a 64-kilometer (km), access controlled expressway \nbetween Jishou and Chadong and the upgrading of two local roads. The two local roads are key \nlocal roads that connect villages with village roads, many of which have already been upgraded. \nThe Xiatuo section, an 86 km south\u2013north route running from Fenghuang county to Huayuan \ncounty, will be linked directly with the project expressway. The other one, the Qianxi section, a \n43 km east-west route, will provide a shorter route from the mining and industrial areas in \nHuayuan and Baojing to the railway station in Guzhang. The Project is located in Xiangxi \nAutonomous Prefecture, which has a population of 2.6 million. The Zhiliu railway traverses five \nof the prefecture\u2019s counties and Jishou city, an important goods collection and distribution \ncenter. The prefecture is rich in water resources, mineral deposits, coal reserves, fertile soil, and \ntourism potential. Reserves of barium, manganese, coal, limestone, gypsum, and dolomite \nstimulate the development of ancillary industries. There are also significant prospects for the \ndevelopment of food processing, herbal medicine manufacturing, and mushroom production. \n \n2.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years.  The  economic  analysis  covers  the \nfollowing 20 years of full operation. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project \nexpressway was estimated by comparing the project case with a base case involving the \ncontinued use and maintenance of the existing road, NR319. Without the Project, congestion \nlevels would increase, causing delays and increasing vehicle operating costs (VOCs), and \naccident rates would rise. The Project, with its reduced travel distance and travel time, safer \ndesign, and better road conditions, will reduce VOCs and accident risks along the corridor. \n \n3.  Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2005 prices. The prices were expressed in \nyuan using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign \nexchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to \nunskilled labor, but not on the wages paid to skilled labor, because no skilled worker surplus \nexists. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate to an \neconomic opportunity cost of labor. The economic costs include (i) the capital cost, including \nphysical contingencies, land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation costs; \nand (ii) the costs of operating and maintaining the expressway, including the costs of replacing \ndepreciated  equipment.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  were  based  on  their \nopportunity costs, that is, the agricultural output forgone and the re-siting of displaced activities.1 \n \n4.  The economic benefits include (i) savings in VOCs resulting from the reduced travel \ndistance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of passengers\u2019 time and of \nfreight tied up in transit, (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents, and (iv) value-added of \ntourism in the project area that is attributable to the Project. The last item was measured as the \nbenefits generated from the development of tourism by comparing the with project situation to \nthe without project situation. Reduced VOCs are the main source of economic benefits for the \nProject. The expressway shortens the route by about 30 km. Traffic using the expressway would \nenjoy higher speeds on a smoother road with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less \ncongestion, and a shorter journey distance. Traffic remaining on the alternative NR319 route \nwould also benefit from a reduction in traffic volume and congestion. All these changes affect \nvehicle speeds and VOCs, which were estimated for all types of vehicles likely to use the \ncorridor. For savings in VOCs, estimates were assessed for both motorized transport and \ninformal means of motorized transport (such as motorcycles, tractors, and 3-wheel vehicles). \nSavings in travel time will occur both on the project expressway and existing roads. Work-\n                                                 \n1  The economic opportunity costs of land were assumed to be equivalent to the replacement value of farmland, \nwhich was calculated for land compensation. No additional opportunity cost for land was assumed, because all the \nland is in rural areas. \n ", "48  Appendix 15 \nrelated  travel  time  was  evaluated  for  private  vehicles  and  buses.  The  economic  cost  of \naccidents was estimated in terms of direct property damage and forgone income. The EIRR for \nthe expressway component is estimated at 17.7%, indicating that the Project is economically \nviable, with a net present value of CNY1.7 billion. \n \n5.  The costs of the local component include capital costs and operation and maintenance \ncosts. The economic benefits include (i) savings in VOCs resulting from the reduced travel \ndistance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of passengers\u2019 time and of \nfreight tied up in transit, (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents, and (iv) value-added of \ntourism that is attributable to the Project. Transport cost savings will accrue to traffic on the \nimproved roads through VOCs. The two local roads have a combined EIRR of 21.0% per year, \nwith a net present value of CNY140 million. \n \n6.  Based on the combined economic cash flows during 2011\u20132030, the Project as a whole \ngenerates an EIRR of 19.1% with a net present value of CNY2.2 billion, indicating that it is \neconomically  viable.  The  savings  in  VOCs  from  the  expressway  top  the  list  of  benefits, \naccounting for 82%, followed by accident cost savings (9%). The benefits of the local roads, \nwhile important to the villages concerned, account for 7.6% of the total benefits (Table A15.1). \n \n7.  The results of sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project\u2019s economic \nviability: changes in the key variables\u2014construction costs, benefits, and a 1-year delay in \nproject completion\u2014do not significantly affect its economic viability. The sensitivity analysis \nindicates that even with a 30% increase in project costs, the EIRR remains comfortable at \n15.6%. When benefits decrease by 20%, costs increase by 20% in parallel with a 1-year delay, \nthe EIRR falls near to the cutoff rate of 12% (Table A15.2). \n \n ", "Appendix 15  49\nTable A15.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return, 2007\u20132030  \n(constant 2005 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million)  \n \n   Cost  Benefits   \n  Civil      Local  Total  VOC  Time  Accident    Local  Total  Net \nYear   Works  Othera  O&M  Roads  Costs  Savings  Savings  Savings  Other  Roads  Benefits  Benefits \n2007  652.8  409.8     40.4  1,102.9            0.0  0.0  -1,102.9 \n2008  783.3  151.0     54.2  988.6            0.0  0.0  -988.6 \n2009  783.3  155.6     54.2  993.2            0.0  0.0  -993.2 \n2010  391.7  0.8     12.6  405.1           0.0  0.0  -405.1 \n2011       8.3  0.8  9.1  563.3  39.5  64.8  15.2  28.3  711.1  702.0 \n2012       8.4  0.8  9.1  597.2  41.9  68.7  16.7  41.9  766.3  757.1 \n2013       8.5  0.8  9.2  632.9  44.4  72.8  18.3  40.6  809.1  799.8 \n2014       8.5  0.8  9.3  670.9  47.0  77.2  20.2  46.5  861.8  852.5 \n2015       8.6  0.8  9.4  711.2  49.9  81.8  22.2  49.0  914.1  904.6 \n2016       8.7  0.8  9.5  753.9  52.9  86.7  24.4  52.2  970.1  960.6 \n2017       8.8  0.8  9.6  799.1  56.0  91.9  26.8  55.6  1,029.5  1,019.9 \n2018       31.9  0.8  32.7  847.0  59.4  97.4  29.5  59.3  1,092.7  1,060.0 \n2019       9.0  0.8  9.8  891.1  62.5  102.5  32.5  63.2  1,151.8  1,142.0 \n2020       9.1  0.8  10.0  937.4  65.7  107.8  35.7  67.5  1,214.1  1,204.2 \n2021       9.3  0.8  10.2  986.2  69.1  113.5  39.3  71.4  1,279.5  1,269.3 \n2022       9.5  0.9  10.3  1,037.4  72.7  119.4  43.2  75.6  1,348.4  1,338.0 \n2023       9.7  0.9  10.5  1,091.4  76.5  125.6  47.6  80.1  1,421.1  1,410.6 \n2024       9.9  0.9  10.7  1,148.1  80.5  132.1  52.3  84.9  1,497.9  1,487.1 \n2025       10.0  0.9  10.9  1,207.8  84.7  139.0  57.5  90.0  1,579.0  1,568.0 \n2026       35.1  0.9  35.9  1,270.6  89.1  146.2  63.3  94.8  1,664.0  1,628.1 \n2027       10.2  0.9  11.1  1,336.7  93.7  153.8  69.6  100.0  1,753.9  1,742.7 \n2028       10.4  0.9  11.3  1,479.3  103.7  170.2  76.6  105.6  1,935.4  1,924.1 \n2029       10.6  0.9  11.6  1,479.3  103.7  170.2  84.2  111.6  1,949.1  1,937.5 \n2030        10.8  0.9  11.7  1,137.6  79.8  130.9  92.7  118.0  1,558.8  1,547.1 \n      Net present value  = 2,225     EIRR = 19.1  \nO&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \na Land acquisition and resettlement costs, environmental mitigation costs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A15.2: Sensitivity to Changes in Economic Benefits and Costs \n \nScenario  EIRR (%)  NPV (CNY million)  Switching Value (%)a \n1.

The Projected financial statements of the proposed Project were prepared in current \nterms for 2007-2030 in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for \nthe  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB. \nConstruction will be completed in December 2010 and the first year of full operation will be 2011. \nThe local inflation rates were assumed at 3% during the projection period. The domestic cost \nescalation factor for the People\u2019s Republic of China is 3%. The price escalation for foreign \nexchange was assumed to be zero. The cost estimates are presented in current terms taking \ninto account the potential impacts of domestic and international inflation. \n \n2.  Operating revenues from tolls were projected based on forecast of future traffic and a \nbase toll rate of CNY 0.35 per passenger car per kilometer (km). Corresponding tolls for other \nvehicle types are CNY 0.40 for a light truck; CNY 0.70 for a small bus or medium-sized truck; \nCNY 1.00 for a large bus or truck; and CNY 1.30 for an articulated truck or a trailer.1 The toll \ncharges are assumed to increase in current terms once every 5 years to keep up with inflation. \nGiven the complexity of the civil works, the capital cost of the Project is much higher than for \nother expressway projects.2 As such, a toll of CNY5 will be charged for use of the suspension \nbridge.  \n \n3.  Annual incremental operation and maintenance costs were calculated based on 2005 \nprices as follows: (i) toll operation costs were estimated at 150 staff with annual salary costs of \nCNY 25,000 per employee; (ii) administration costs were assumed to be CNY3.75 million per \nyear, with an annual increase of 3%; and (iii) maintenance costs were estimated at CNY40,000 \nper  km  per  year  for  routine  work  and  CNY1.0  million  per  km  for  periodic  work.  Period \nmaintenance was scheduled for 2018 and 2026. Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are \ncharged on revenue. Corporate income tax at 15% is paid on income after deducting business \ntaxes, depreciation and interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried \nforward. \n \n4.  An ADB loan, a loan from State Development Bank, and grants from the Ministry of \nCommunications and the Hunan Provincial Government are expected to cover project financing. \nThe ADB loan amounts to $208 million, with standard ordinary capital resources terms of a 25-\nyear  utilization  period  and  a  5-year  grace  period.  The  grants  from  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications and the Hunan Provincial Government amount to 30% of project costs, which \nwill be viewed as project equity. The State Development Bank will provide CNY1,300 million, \nwith a 25-year repayment period at an interest rate of 5.51%. An estimated 5% of passenger \ncars were considered to be exempt from paying tolls.  \n \n5.  Projected  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Table  A16.  The  projected  financial \nstatements indicate that the revenues are adequate to cover operation and maintenance costs; \nhowever, net income is negative in the first 5 years of operation because of high depreciation \ncosts  and  high  interest  payments.  The  cash  flow  projections  show  a  positive  cash  flow \nthroughout the project period. The financial projections indicate that operational efficiency is \nsatisfactory and the debt-service coverage ratio of more than 1.2 is achievable from the fifth \nyear of operation. The debt-to-equity ratio will be less than 65:35 for the first year and will \ngradually improve thereafter. \n                                                 \n1 The assumed toll rates are consistent both with trends of Hunan practice and tolls on the existing expressways. \n2  The per km cost for the project expressway is $6.1 million, much higher than the $2.4 million for projects in flat \nareas, or even the $5.1 million for projects in mountainous area, mainly because of the complexity of the civil works. \nOf the 64 km expressway, tunnels, large bridges, and a suspension bridge account for 30 km: 13 tunnels (10.5 km), \n36 extra large and large bridges (18 km), and a suspension bridge (1.16 km). Without the suspension bridge, the \nper km cost is $4.8 million, roughly equal to the average cost in mountainous areas.   \n ", " \nTable A16: Projected Financial Statements for the Jishou\u2013Chadong Expressway, Selected Years \n(current CNY million) \n \n \n1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   15   20   24    \nItem \n2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2021  2026  2030 \nIncome Statement \nOperating Revenues                                    \nToll Revenues             200  238   252  267  294  311  481  722   1,010 \n   Total Revenues             210  262   277  293  323  342  529  795   1,111 \nNet Revenue after business tax             203  254   262  277  306  323  500  751  1,050 \nOperation and maintenance                                       \nDepreciation             425  383    345  311  281  253  157  86  57 \nTotal Operating Expenses             435  395    358  324  295  268  176  111  88 \n   Net Operating Income             (232)  (141)   (96)  (47)  11  55  324  640  962 \nLess: Interest Expenses             162  161    157  152  148  143  115  78  42 \n   Net Income After Corporative Tax             (395)  (302)   (252)  (200)  (137)  (88)  141  376  617 \nOperating Profit Ratio          (111%)  (54%)  -34%  (16%)  3%  16%  48%  57%  59% \nCash Flow Statement                            \nNet Cash Inflows from Operations            28  80  93  111  143  165  297  462  673 \nAsian Development Bank Loan  430  516  516  258                          \nMinistry of Communications Grant  221  265  265  132                          \nDomestic Bank Loan  354  425  425  212                          \nHunan Provincial Government  202  242  242  121                          \nSubtotal Cash Inflow  1,206  1,448  1,448  782  28  80   93  111  143  165  297  462  673 \nConstruction Costs  1,206  1,448  1,448  724                     117    \nPrinciple Repayment              28  82  86  90  95  100  128  165    \nSubtotal Cash Outflows  1,206  1,448  1,448  724  28  82   86  90  95  100  128  281  201 \nNet Cash Flows          0   (2)  7  21  47  65  169  180  471 \nDebt-Service Coverage Ratio              1.80  1.00   1.03  1.09  1.20  1.27  1.70  2.23  2.95  A\np\np\nBalance Sheet                            e\nn\nCurrent Assets             63  62  69  90  139  205  871  2076  3826  dix\n 1\nAccumulated Fixed Assets              4,826  4,971   5,120  5,273  5,431  5,594  6,583  7,632  8,717  6\nTLoontagl- Atesrsme tLso ans  1,270864   21,,675245   42,,616062   34,,183876   34,,140694   34,,022275     24,,904316   32,,980501    32,,872566   32,,860526   42,,047758   16,,322697    8,568921   5          \n1\nDebt-Equity Ratio  65  65  65  64  70  72   73  73  72  70  46  21  7 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.

A financial evaluation has been undertaken in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \nProjects Financed by ADB. A financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated based on \nthe  Project\u2019s  capital  cost,  the  most  recent  traffic  forecasts,  and  the  proposed  toll  rates. \nSensitivity tests were conducted by varying the project costs, traffic volumes, and toll rates and \ncombinations  of  these  factors.  The  financial  evaluation  was  computed  over  4  years  of \nconstruction and 20 years of operations. The calculations are in constant 2005 prices.  \n \n2.  The local inflation rates were assumed at 3% during the projection period. The domestic \ncost escalation factor for the People\u2019s Republic of China is 3%. The price escalation for foreign \nexchange was assumed to be zero. The cost estimates are presented in current terms taking \ninto account the potential impacts of domestic and international inflation. \n \n3.  Hunan  province  is  applying  unified  toll  rates  to  all  expressways  according  to  the \nprovincial government\u2019s policy. The toll rates were developed based on the Hunan Provincial \nGovernment\u2019s toll road policies, affordability for road users, and neighboring provinces\u2019 toll rates. \nFor the purpose of the FIRR calculation, existing toll rates in Hunan have been used and held \nconstant throughout the calculation period. The project capital cost is much higher than for other \nexpressway projects in Hunan province because of the difficult geographic and geological \nconditions. A special toll of CNY5 per vehicle will be charged for traffic crossing the suspension \nbridge. Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are charged on revenue. Corporate income \ntax at 15% is paid on income after deducting business taxes, depreciation and interest charges, \noperating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward. \n \n4.  The  major  assumptions  used  for  calculation  of  the  FIRR  are  the  following:  (i)  all \ncalculations are made in 2005 prices, covering 2007 to 2030; (ii) capital costs include all \nincremental capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment for the expressway, \nbut exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operating and maintaining \ncosts  include  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but \nexclude depreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from toll used in \nfinancial projections are also adjusted to 2005 prices; and (v) the residual value of the project \ncapital cost was estimated to be 50% after 20 years of operation. \n \n5.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after tax, in real terms was calculated at \n2.8%, using estimated capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: (i) \nthe applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.60% was used for \nADB debt; (ii) the estimated interest costs of 5.76% per annum is used for the domestic loan \nfunds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8.00%. The cost of debt was also adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income of 15%. \n \n6.  The FIRR, computed after tax, is calculated at 5.5% (Table A17.1).

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n  Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \nIs the sector identified as a national \n  priority in country poverty partnership   \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n    No  agreement?      No \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: \n \nThe project expressway from Jishou to Chadong, which will be 30 km shorter, will cut travel time to less than 1 hour. \nBy lowering transport costs and improving the quality of transport services, the Project is expected to spur economic \nactivities and inter-regional trade, thereby helping reduce poverty in the project area. The development of the road \nnetwork in western Hunan will help transfer the benefits of the eastern region\u2019s economic growth to the poor western \nregion. The improvement of local roads has been integrated into the Project to spread the benefits of the expressway \nover a wider cross-section of poor communities. The integrated approach will improve the rural poor\u2019s mobility, and \nthus their access to economic opportunities, helping to raise their incomes. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe project area covers one city and four counties, all of which are considered poor by either national or provincial \nstandards. The Project will directly benefit 1.3 million local residents, of which 0.9 million (72%) live in rural areas. The \nProject will lower transport costs and reduce travel time and thus, once completed, the Project will improve the quality \nof transport services. Better road infrastructure and services will encourage villagers to go to markets, use educational \nand health facilities more frequently, and avail themselves of increased agricultural extension services. These \nbenefits, which accrue directly to road users, are the Project\u2019s direct effects. Over time, improved road access will \nexpand economic activities in the area and gradually lead to structural changes in production and consumption \npatterns and in the labor market. Lower transport costs reduce the costs of traded farm inputs, thereby raising \nagricultural productivity and profitability. Cropping patterns change with better roads, as farmers shift to higher-value \ncrops because of easier access to markets and new farming technologies. These are the benefits that trickle down to \nlocal people over time. Even the rural poor who rarely use roads also benefit from improved roads through more and \ncheaper goods and services and increased economic opportunities. These are the Project\u2019s indirect effects. Using the \nadequate monitoring framework and mechanism, actual impacts on poverty will be assessed. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder consultation and analysis was done during project preparation and the roles of all stakeholders were \nwell  defined.  The  Hunan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HCD)  is  the  executing  agency.  The  local \ngovernments  and  communities  will  implement  the  Resettlement  Plan,  and  organize  local  labor  to  build  the \nexpressway. With support from HCD, local governments will upgrade township roads. Public consultation raised the \nlevel of awareness and garnered local support. These processes enabled local stakeholders to express their opinions \nand to make relevant suggestions for the design of the expressway and local roads. Intensive consultations were \nundertaken with poor rural women and representatives of minority populations. To further consider poor women and \nminorities, the participatory activities will continue during project implementation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe contractors will hire rural villagers including unskilled workers in the project area. Before the alignment was \nfinalized, local government officials and villagers were consulted to minimize losses of high-quality arable land and \nstructures. Township governments and community organizations  will  be involved in the implementation  of the \neconomic rehabilitation component of the Resettlement Plan. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nYoung women account for 39% of total migrants from the surveyed communities. Of all 126 women consulted, 82% \nwere satisfied about their current status, 5% were unsatisfied, and 13% were unclear. Of the minority women \nconsulted,  90%  were  satisfied with their current status.  In general,  the project is gender neutral and will not have an ", "Appendix 18  55\nadverse impact on women. Women and children will benefit substantially from the local roads for access to schools, \nmarkets, and health care and other social services. As part of the participation strategy, priority will be given to women \nfor direct and indirect project benefits,  which are included in the ethnic  minorities development plan.

The project area covers one city and four counties, all of which are considered poor by \neither national or provincial standards. Some 600 of 1,381 villages are poor, and minorities \naccount for almost 100% of the total population of these villages. Members of the Tujia and \nMiao minorities account for 74% of the total population affected by the Project. Consultations \nwith 126 rural women from 15 villages indicated that 82% of them are satisfied with their current \nsocial economic status and only 5% of them are unsatisfied. In the villages surveyed, women \nare more dominant in household decision making than men, indicating that minority women \nhave a good social position in their families. Temporary in-migration of ethnic minorities is \ncommon, especially to work in the mining industry. However, the current citizenship registration \nsystem and rural land tenure system do not permit migration to rural areas. Therefore the \nminority townships will not be affected by in-migration.  \n \n2.  Surveys  identified  1,794  ethnic  minority  households  that  will  be  affected  by  land \nacquisition (84% of all those affected).Three of the four interchanges were included to connect \nthe project roads to the rural minority townships. The Project will directly benefit 0.93 million \nlocal residents, of which 0.73 million are minorities. Local residents, mostly minorities, have \nexpressed a desire to receive training in appropriate agricultural techniques to take advantage \nof new cash cropping strategies and to receive support for opening small businesses. The plan \nto address their needs, while referred to as the Ethnic Minorities Development Plan (EMDP), \nwas prepared to safeguard all those affected in the project area regardless of their ethnic \nidentity. Adequate provisions to enhance the economic conditions of vulnerable groups have \nbeen integrated in the Project\u2019s design and provisions for special mitigation measures have \nbeen included in the Resettlement Plan. To mitigate possible adverse impacts and enhance \npositive impacts on the minorities, the government will implement measures shown in Table A19. \n \nTable A19: Mitigation Measures \n \nBudget \nProposed Actions  Targets  Year  (CNY million)  Source \nProtection from Disturbances Arising         \nfrom Construction Activities         \nProhibiting night construction  More than 50,000  2007\u20132010  0  The Project \nBuilding pedestrian crossings,  people  30  \noverpasses and underpasses, and  More than 50    \nculverts  villages, including   \nReconstructing damaged irrigation  39 villages affected  50  \nand/or drainage systems  by land acquisition \nand resettlement  \nAwareness and Prevention of         \nHIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted         \nInfections         \nHealth clinics near construction camps  In all construction  2007\u20132010  0.1  Hunan Provincial Health \nPrevention posters  camps and nearby  0.1   Department, Hunan \nEducation programs through media  villages, especially  0.1   Provincial \nchannels and clinics  among women and    Communications \nDistribution of condoms  ethnic minorities  0.5   Department (HCD), and \nlocal governments \nResettlement          \nFull compensation  39 villages  2005\u2013 2006  150   Resettlement Plan \nSpecial support to vulnerable groups  1.84    ", "Appendix 19  57\nBudget \nProposed Actions  Targets  Year  (CNY million)  Source \nIncome Recovery for Those Affected         \nby Resettlement          \nReceive support from local governments  Those affected by  2005\u20132007  0  Resettlement Plan \nand village cadres when assistance is  resettlement,   \nrequested  especially the 10   \nPriority given to training, adult education,  seriously affected  0.2  \nand construction employment  villages  \nopportunities \nRoad and Traffic Safety          \nRepositioning of the number two police  Local people residing  2006 onward  0.1   Provincial and county \ntraffic team of Huayuan county from  in communities    police traffic teams  \nMalichang to Jiwei township   along NR319 and   \nProvision of traffic police teams on local  local roads  0.5  \nroads in all counties  Drivers on NR319   \nConstant patrolling on market days in  and local roads  0 \nrural towns     \nRoad safety education programs  0.2  \nStrict implementation of traffic  0 \nregulations  \nPoverty Reduction Interventions          \nTechnical training on fruit and animal  Microcredit, at least  2006 onward  25.0  Local governments \nproduction  20% of which will     \nDistribution of market information   be targeted to  1.0  Local governments \nEducational, medical, and water supply  female and ethnic  25.0  financed by the Japan \nfacilities in Fenghuang and Baojing  minority borrowers  Bank for International \nMultipurpose complex (market,  Cooperation \nrestaurant, and transport center) in  Japanese Embassy in \nYaoyou township    the People\u2019s Republic \nof China \nTourism Development          \nAnnouncement of the opening of local  Counties within the  2006 onward  0  Local governments \nroad sections on tourism web sites  project area   \nConstruction of tourism infrastructure  Tourists and tourism  1,000  \nPromotion of tourism resources  agents   5  \nFarmland Reclamation and         \nReforestation         \nLand reclamation  39 villages  2006\u20132008  27.03   Provincial Land Bureau \nReforestation  6.69   Provincial Forestry \nBureau \nImproved Transport Services         \nConstruction of Jishou bus terminals  Rural households in  2006\u20132010  47.91  HCD and local \n40 township bus stations  the project area of  30  governments \nEnhanced competition among service  which 85% are  0 \nproviders  minorities and 33% \nwere poor (in 2003) \nConstruction of Local Roads         \nTwo intercounty roads  County and township  2006\u20132010  240   The Project \n400 kilometres of county-township roads  governments and  200   HCD and local \ncommunities along  governments \nthe roads \nEmployment of Unskilled Minorities for         \nConstructing the expressway  Priority given to local  2006\u20132010  Included in civil  The Project \nImproving 129 kilometers of local roads  labor and vulnerable  works contracts  The Project, HCD, and \npeople.

The 64-kilometer (km) project expressway and its 5.9 km connector road will directly \naffect 39 villages and 10 townships in Jishou city and Huayuan county. The two local roads (43 \nkm and 86 km) will affect four counties. The field survey indicated that the project expressway \nand connector road will require 351 hectares of land to be permanently acquired, of which is \n32% is paddy, 19% is dry land, 3% is planted with vegetables or orchards, 44% is forestland, \nand 2% consists of other types of land. Based on the amount of per capita farmland in the \naffected villages, the land acquisition is equivalent to the complete loss of farmland for 3,105 \npeople. About 115 hectares of land will be used temporarily during the construction phase. The \nnumber of rural people whose houses will be demolished is 973, with total floor space of their \nhouses amounting to 27,491 square meters. For the local roads, the impact will be small \nbecause existing alignments will be upgraded. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were \nminimized  by  aligning  the  expressway  away  from  densely  populated  areas  and  avoiding \nirrigated land and production facilities based on consultations with local officials and affected \npeople. \n \n2.  The  Resettlement  Plan  was  prepared  by  the  Hunan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment (HCD) with the help of technical assistance consultants. The Resettlement Plan \nwas based on the preliminary design and socioeconomic surveys covering 400 households and \n39 village-level interviews. The surveys revealed that 84% of the affected households are ethnic \nminorities,  mostly  Miao.  Consultations  were  conducted  with  the  affected  people  and  their \ncomments and suggestions were reviewed to ensure that any concerns are addressed. The \ndraft Resettlement Plan has been reviewed by the affected city and counties and by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and these comments have been incorporated into the Resettlement \nPlan. After the detailed design approval by  HCD, a detailed survey will be carried out to \ndetermine  the  precise  number  of  people  and  assets  affected.  Changes  and  related  cost \nadjustments  will  be  included  in  an  updated  Resettlement  Plan  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval prior to the commencement of compensation and land acquisition.  \n \n3.  For people unavoidably affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is to ensure \nthe  attainment  of  equal  or  better  livelihoods  and  living  standards  in  line  with  the  Land \nAdministration Law (1998) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Policy on \nIndigenous  peoples  (1998).  The  Resettlement  Plan  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlement \nprovisions for those losing land, houses, and income and provides relocation and economic \nrehabilitation measures and strategies. HCD will ensure that the resettlement entitlements are \nprovided to the people affected prior to ground clearance and the commencement of demolition. \nLand  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidies  will  be  paid  to  affected  village  groups  or \nindividuals. Housing compensation and compensation for young crops and other assets will be \nprovided directly to people losing those assets.  \n \n4.  Sites for relocation should be selected in line with the plans for income restoration and \noverall  township  plans.  Generally  there  are three  options  for  selecting  sites  for  residential \nresettlement: (i) for villages where only several households are involved in house relocation, the \nnew housing sites will be selected in the same village or land-owning group as agreed with the \naffected households; (ii) if more households have to be relocated, a site suitable for a cluster of \nhouses will be selected keeping farmers\u2019 preferences in mind; and (iii) for households that wish \nto move to towns, both the township government and villages will consider the requests. \n \n5.  Proposed income rehabilitation measures are to (i) incorporate the resettlement into \nlocal economic development programs, such as production development or irrigation system ", "Appendix 20  59\nimprovement and expansion; (ii) facilitate cash crop production, animal husbandry, and fish \nfarming; (iii) establish small businesses based on local resource endowments; and (iv) provide \nincome insurance to households with elderly members. Detailed needs for farmers to enhance \ntheir working skills have been analyzed by means of the socioeconomic survey and relevant \ntraining has been included in the Resettlement Plan. For vulnerable groups, the Project will \nprovide a special social assistance fund to secure their livelihoods and living conditions. \n \n6.  HCD  will  be  responsible  for  the  general  administration  of  the  Project.  A  Project \nResettlement Office will be set up to coordinate, monitor, and supervise land acquisition and \nresettlement. Resettlement organizations will be established at the prefecture, city, and county \nlevels. Each affected township will have a resettlement office. Resettlement and land acquisition \ncosts for the Project are estimated at CNY264 million ($31.96 million). Some adjustments in the \nbudget are expected following the detailed measurement survey. \n \n7.  At various stages, affected people have been consulted about the likely impacts of the \nProject. The stakeholders consulted include (i) heads of households that will be affected, (ii) \nvillage heads and villagers\u2019 representatives, (iii) local government agencies and departments, \nand (iv) women and vulnerable groups. Two public hearings are planned by the Hunan Land \nand Resources Department, one to adjust the Land Use Plan and a second to fix compensation \nrates based on the detailed measurement survey. Consultation will continue throughout the \nimplementation period. HCD organized public consultation meetings in the affected villages. Key \nfindings  indicated  full  support  for  the  Project.  Some  of  the  concerns  raised  have  been \naddressed by adjusting the design and improving compensation and resettlement measures \nand entitlements. Those affected were provided with a resettlement information booklet in June \n2005.  In  the  case  of  grievances,  all  complaints  will  be  processed  based  on  Government \nRegulation Number 431 on Grievance and Redress, which came into effect on 1 May 2005.  \n \n8.  The Resettlement Plan includes internal and external monitoring systems. The Project \nResettlement Office and local resettlement offices will be responsible for internal monitoring to \nensure the timely and satisfactory implementation of land acquisition and resettlement activities \naccording to the Resettlement Plan. Reporting will be quarterly and a resettlement completion \nreport will be prepared. The reports will be sent to ADB in a timely manner to keep ADB closely \ninformed of progress and any substantive changes. \n \n9.  An independent institute or organization will be contracted to carry out the external \nmonitoring and  evaluation.  The  tasks include  (i)  reviewing  and  verifying  the  compensation \npayments;  (ii)  ascertaining  the  status  of  land  acquisition and  compensation  payments;  (iii) \nassessing the compensation disbursement procedure; (iv) appraising the grievance procedure; \n(v)  determining  recipients\u2019  satisfaction  with  the  entitlements  and  compensation;  and  (vi) \nassessing the efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of the resettlement to draw \nlessons  for  future  resettlement  implementation,  formulation,  and  planning.
