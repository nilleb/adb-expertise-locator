INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to helping its developing member \ncountries (DMCs) improve social and economic mobility, reduce poverty, and move economies \ntoward sustainable patterns of production.  Although many private sector companies have come \nto  value  sustainable  development,  they  vary  in  their  capacity  to  adopt  socially  and \nenvironmentally  responsible  business  processes  and  make  these  a  part  of  their  key \nperformance metrics. When development results1 are shown to add value to core business \noperations, they can be a powerful tool for continuing interest and investment in these by the \nprivate  sector.2 Since  2009,  ADB  has  increased  its  efforts  to  systematically  capture  the \ndevelopment results of its private sector operations (PSO).3 This includes monitoring results \nagainst  well-defined  indicators  and  targets. This  technical  assistance  (TA)  goes  further  in \nimproving the capacity for capturing not only the direct but also the indirect development results \nof PSO. The design and monitoring framework (DMF) is listed in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   Development is ultimately about all people attaining a basic standard of living, but this is \na complex socioeconomic and political process. The intergenerational choices involved are aptly \nreflected in the United Nations definition of sustainable development as development \u201cthat \nmeets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet \ntheir  own  needs.\"5 One  of  the  stark  development  challenges  common  to  ADB\u2019s  region  of \noperations is non-income inequality in reliable access to basic services such as clean water, \nelectricity, health care, insurance, and education\u2014even by those who can pay for these. This \nproblem persists despite a reduction in absolute poverty from 26.9% in 2005 to 20% in 2010 \nand the expected graduation of all of ADB\u2019s DMCs except Afghanistan and Nepal to middle-\nincome status by 2020.6  Another troubling development has been widening income inequalities. \nThese inequities exacerbate social and economic discontent, especially in countries with high \nlevels of youth unemployment, and are likely to worsen as populations grow. Furthermore, the \ncontinuation of gross domestic product growth strategies that neglect environmental costs such \nas air and water pollution are proving detrimental to the long-term well-being of the region\u2019s \ncitizens, especially low-income households. \n \n3.  Some of these development challenges were highlighted in the 2014 midterm review of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which in 2008 made inclusive growth and environmentally sustainable \ngrowth, two of ADB\u2019s three interrelated strategic agendas. The midterm review also noted \nslowing economic growth in the region and the vulnerability of people to slip back into poverty, \nas a result of irreversible climate related damage to resources. \n \n                                                \n1 ADB\u2019s private sector operations seek specific development results:  (i) private sector development; (ii) business \nsuccess (including financial success); (iii) economic sustainability; and (iv) environment and social protection, and \npromotion of health and safety.  \n2 For instance, improving the assessment of the credit risk of small and medium-sized enterprises by basing it on \ncash flow rather than collateral can not only improve access to finance for small enterprises but also create a new \nmarket segment for the lending institution. \n3 ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n ", "2  \n4.   In this context, ADB must demonstrate an ability not only to identify the vulnerable and \ntheir  vulnerabilities,  but  also  to  offer  innovative,  cost-effective  solutions  to  these  lingering \ndevelopment  problems  that  are  well  thought  out.  To  help  do  this,  alongside  public  sector \nfinancing, the midterm review commits ADB to increase focus on private sector development, \ninvest  more  in  private  sector  operations,  and  \u201cmeasure  progress  and  results  in  reducing \npoverty N. and increasing inclusion.\u201d7 In 2013, ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department \nundertook  a  thematic  evaluation  of  the  contribution  of  ADB\u2019s  PSO  to  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. The report concluded that in addition to targeting the poor \nwith subsidies to improve affordability, a valid inclusion approach is to increase access of low-\nincome households to essential goods and services from the private sector. The report also \nrecommended that ADB improve its analysis of its direct and indirect contributions to inclusive \ngrowth and of the causal pathways of these contributions at the project and country levels.8 \n \n5.   At  present  all  PSO  have  DMFs  that  clearly  identify  intended  technical,  economic, \nfinancial,  and  social  development  results.  All  private  sector  clients  are  increasingly  being \nrequired  to  provide  information  on  performance  against  DMF  indicators  and  targets.  ADB \npublishes an annual development effectiveness report to highlight successes and areas needing \nimprovement.9 However, the data for this report mainly comes from extended annual review \nreports\u2014i.e., from ADB\u2019s project completion reports\u2014and a clear need exists for technical \nsupport to capture PSO development results more regularly. Data is also needed to evaluate \nwhich  strategies  worked  well  and  which  were  less  effective.  Since  the  development \neffectiveness of PSO can be enhanced by effective government policies and the business \noperating environment, there is a need to also review situations where interventions have been \nmore or less effective because of these factors. The TA therefore seeks to strengthen three \nareas.  \n \n6.    First, ADB\u2019s private sector clients need support in collecting and analyzing data on \nsome results indicators that they usually do not report on.  At other times, clients face practical \nobstacles  to  providing  such  data.  For  instance,  clients  continue  to  win  concessions  after \napproval of the report and recommendation of the President for a PSO, and this means that \nbaseline socioeconomic data at these geographic locations, along with data on operational \nperformance has to be collected during implementation. As a result of these and other factors \ncurrent data gaps include the following:  \n \n(i)  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  finance  (gender  disaggregation  of  loan \napplicants, the types of loans acquired, the performance of borrowers, growth of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, and new jobs created); \n(ii)  education  (job  placement  of  graduates  of  different  degree  programs  from  a \nprivate university); \n(iii)  water supply (poor and low-income beneficiaries and the benefits of improved \nwater quality standards); \n                                                \n7 Footnote 6, para 83. \n8 ADB.  2013.  Learning  Lessons  Series:  Enhancing  the  contribution  of  the  Private  Sector  to  Inclusive  and \nEnvironmentally  Sustainable  Growth.  Manila.  http://www.adb.org/documents/learning-lessons-enhancing-\ncontribution-private-sector-inclusive-and-environmentally \n9  ADB. 2014. Development Effectiveness Report 2013: Private Sector Operations. Manila.   \nhttp://www.adb.org/documents/development-effectiveness-review-2013-report \n \n \n \n ", "  3\n(iv)  health (reduction in the cost of services, improved access by rural and periurban \nhouseholds, and improved quality of services); \n(v)  agribusiness (improvement in productivity, real increases in household incomes, \nand safe working conditions); \n(vi)  off-grid renewable energy (access to and cost of electricity resulting from PSO \nand the auxiliary local businesses created along the value chain, e.g., for repairs \nand maintenance); and \n(vii)  housing finance (affordability of new facilities). \n \n7.    Second, the indirect or secondary effects of PSO are often more far-reaching than the \ndirect effects and need to be captured. For instance, while the direct employment created by \nmodern power infrastructure may be small, thousands of jobs are created by the companies that \nuse the power. Similarly, investee companies of private equity funds will likely create more jobs \nthan the direct jobs created at the equity fund.  \n \n8.   Third,  the  PSO  results  data  needs  to  be  made  comparable.  Many  international \ndevelopment  finance  institutions  are  collecting  data  from  their  clients,  but  the  indicator \ndefinitions\u2014of full employment, for example\u2014and the data collection methods they use often \ndiffer and so cannot be compared. International finance institutions (IFIs) have recognized this, \nand in October 2013, 25 of them harmonized the first set of quantitative indicators. Further steps \nare now needed to harmonize qualitative indicators and conversion factors. Joint work is also \nneeded  in  such  areas such  as  impact  investing,  inclusive  growth,  and  inclusive  business. \nMaking  data  comparable  will  have  knock-on  effects  such  as  increasing  efficiency  through \nshared data analysis by cofinanciers of PSO and reducing multiple reporting by clients. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.   The impact of the TA will be greater development effectiveness of ADB\u2019s PSO. This will \nbe measured by indicators that track (i) improvements in results on important socioeconomic \ncriteria such as affordability, cost of service delivery, skills development, and technological \nenhancements, and (ii) the overall success rate of non-sovereign operations.   \n \n10.    The outcome of the TA will be improved capacity of private sector clients in measuring \nand communicating the development results of PSO. The outputs will be (i) better quality \ninformation on the direct and indirect effects of PSO, (ii) harmonized development results and \nindicators for PSO and, (iii) PSO knowledge disseminated.  The TA will help ADB PSO clients \ncreate baseline data, monitor progress, and report on results. Under output 1, in addition to \nestablishing  monitoring  systems,  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  is \nparticipating in a global partnership, called Let\u2019s Work, to understand the main constraints on \njob creation and how best to create more and better private sector jobs, including via value \nchains.10 Work  being  undertaken  by  this  partnership  will  (i)  include  studies  that  deepen \nunderstanding  of  how  PSO  can  contribute  to  direct  and  indirect  job  creation  in  the  real \neconomy11 and financial markets, and (ii) develop methodological tools to measure expected \nresults.  Under output 2, PSOD is working with more than 25 IFIs to agree on core indicators \nand common definitions. For output 3, PSOD will work closely with ADB\u2019s regional departments \n                                                \n10 The partnership, called Let\u2019s Work (http://www.letswork.org) was launched as a follow-up to a 2013 IFC jobs study. \n11 The industries to be studied include automotive and agribusiness. \n ", "4  \nand the Regional and Sustainable Development Department in the development of knowledge \nproducts from these studies. This will be an example of the one-ADB approach in the area of \nprivate sector development and PSO.12  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  To achieve output 1, the TA will identify 15 projects where consultants will work with the \nprivate sector clients to collect data for due diligence, monitor implementation, and/or undertake \nself-assessment. Some of the risks to completing this exercise relate to possible difficulties in \nobtaining beneficiary data that may be confidential by law \u2014for example, regarding clients of \nbanks. The consultants are expected to recommend practical and cost-effective methodologies \nfor data collection and analysis that ADB\u2019s private sector clients can continue to use. For the \nstudies to be undertaken under the Let\u2019s Work partnership, the methodologies will include input \nand output analysis, production functions, and micro case studies. The activities for delivering \noutput 2 will include collation and comparison of IFI indicators and recommendations for the \nharmonization of definitions. Key activities for output 3 will include converting the TA findings \ninto blogs, policy briefs, and opinion editorials.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.19 million, of which $1.2 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and $240,000 will be \ncontributed by other IFIs for output 2. The private sector clients will contribute in-kind support in \nterms of staff and resources for $750,000 for 15 projects. For output 1, $980,000 has been \nallocated. Of this amount, PSOD will sign an administration agreement with the International \nFinance  Corporation  for  the  use  of  $250,000  to  undertake  studies  under  the  Let\u2019s  Work \npartnership,13 and utilize the remaining $730,000 for monitoring and assessment activities. For \noutput 2, the TA will fund up to $40,000 for four harmonization exercises, covering consultations \nand report preparation.  For output 3, $105,000 has been allocated for reports, communications \nand seminars. A further amount of $15,000 has been allocated for administration costs and \n$60,000 for contingencies, within the overall TA costs.  The cost estimates and financing plan is \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.    The TA will be initiated in January 2015, and implemented in a phased manner until \nDecember 2018. The three outputs have separate implementation arrangements. ADB will be \nthe executing agency for the capacity development component under output 1. ADB will recruit \na consulting firm for services using quality- and cost-based selection, with a quality-cost ratio of \n80:20.  For the Let\u2019s Work partnership activities under output 1, the International Finance \nCorporation is serving as the secretariat (Appendix 3). Participating IFIs will nominate countries \n                                                \n12 For instance, the one-ADB approach for knowledge products is reflected in one or more of the following: (i) The \nADB operation and knowledge product was delivered through active collaboration within ADB (departments, \nresident missions, DMCs, specialized knowledge departments or communities of practice. (ii) The ADB operation \nand knowledge products and services differed significantly from previous interventions and offers new insights for \nthe rest of ADB and DMCs.  The recommendations of this knowledge solution were (or are) actually applied in the \nDMC or by the target client. (iii) The knowledge products and services have made a significant knowledge \ncontribution to emerging and medium-term issues in the Asia and Pacific region. (iv) The reach of these knowledge \nproducts and services significantly raised ADB\u2019s prominence in this sector, theme, or subject. \n13 All other members participating in this partnership will also be contributing at least similar amounts as ADB. \n ", "  5\nand projects for the studies to the steering committee for approval.14   A study on the job effects \nof IFI interventions in the energy sector in the Philippines is scheduled to be the first to get \nunder way in Asia and the Pacific. PSOD will work closely with ADB\u2019s Economics and Research \nDepartment, as well as with country and sector economists to ensure the studies undertaken \nare of relevance to ADB\u2019s operations. PSOD is represented on the steering committee of the \npartnership and is part of the technical working group for infrastructure.  \n \n14.   To  achieve  output  2,  the  Inter-American  Development  Bank  is  currently  leading  a \nharmonization study on qualitative indicators. It will be the implementing agency for this output \nand will receive up to $10,000 under the TA. ADB may be requested by IFIs to act as the \nexecuting agency for future harmonization work. For output 3, the development effectiveness \nteam in PSOD will work with the Department of External Relations and hire consultants as \nneeded to convert findings under outputs 1 and 2 and from ADB PSO into knowledge products, \nusing  such  communications  media  as  blogs,  seminars,  brown  bags,  publications,  opinion \neditorials, and policy briefs.  \n \n15.   ADB will be the executing agency for output 3. ADB will engage individual consultants for \nthe work, mainly because (i) all consultants will work separately and be responsible for specific \ndeliverables and geographic coverage, and (ii) the expertise is specialized and localized and \ntherefore difficult to source from a single firm. The selection and hiring of the TA consultants and \ntheir services will conform to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). All consulting services under the TA will be engaged on output-based lump \nsum  contracts.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Terms of reference \nfor the consultants are given in Appendix 3. The TA will be closed and a project completion \nreport prepared by PSOD by 31 December 2019.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n16.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis \nfor Measuring the Development Effectiveness of Private Sector Operations, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n14 Once the research program is finalized, specific technical working groups will prepare the terms of reference for \nconsultants and supervise the quality of deliverables. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact       Assumptions \nGreater development  Success rates of NSO reach  SPD data on project  Development \neffectiveness of  at least 72% (2020) from 67%  success rates; IED  effectiveness results \nADB\u2019s private sector  (2013)  evaluations  from the TA inform \noperations       NSO financing and \n    portfolio management \n    decisions. \n     \n   \nPSOD has close \nAt least 40% of PSOD clients  Private sector client \nworking relationship \nin the portfolio submit  data \nwith the regional \nmonitoring data on an   \ndepartments. \nsemiannual basis by 2023,  ADB portfolio \ncompared with 20% in 2013  systems  Better evidence for \non development results such    development results \nas (i) quality of services, (ii)  Independent studies   helps improve PSO \ncost of service delivery, (iii)    performance. \ntechnology enhancements,  Development   \n(iv) access to goods and  effectiveness   \nservices by low-income  monitoring reports  Risk \nhouseholds, (v) commercial    Supportive public \nand economic viability, (vi)  policies for private \nskills development, (vii) real  sector operations are \nincomes and/or expenditures,  under development or \nand (viii) SME growth  are not fully \nimplemented in DMCs. \nOutcome       Assumption \nImproved capacity of  At least 15 PSOD clients  Sponsor reports  Private sector clients \nprivate sector clients  establish cost-effective    adopt practical and \nfor measuring and  monitoring systems by 2019.    cost-effective \ncommunicating the      monitoring and \ndevelopment results  At least 12 PSOD clients  Development  communications \nof PSO  track development results  effectiveness  strategies. \nusing the methodologies  monitoring reports   \nestablished under the TA by     \n2019.     \n     \nAt least 10 PSOD clients use  TA reports  Risk \nsocial media, websites, and    Weak data quality \npublications to communicate  and/or data integrity   \ntheir development results to \nshareholders and the public \nfrom 2018 onwards. \nOutputs   Capacity building:    Assumptions \n    Consultants\u2019 reports  Participating IFIs and \n1.

Let\u2019s Work Studies: Power and Jobs \n8.  Objectives of the study. The Let\u2019s Work study shall assess the relationship between \n \npower and jobs in the Philippines. It will have the following two components: \n \n(i)  At the macro level, the study will assess quantitatively the impact of power on jobs \nin the Philippines. It will particularly take into account the fact that after 2001 the \nGovernment  of  the  Philippines  embarked  on  a  comprehensive  power  sector \nreform program under the Electricity and Power Industry Reform Act. The act \nenvisaged a fully competitive power sector, with extensive private sector entry and \ndivestiture of public sector assets. The study will quantify how this reform has \naffected the quantity and quality of power supply, access, prices, and eventual \nemployment and economic growth.  \n \n(ii)  At the micro level, the study will focus on two projects to quantify how these \nprojects have impacted employment in terms of (a) direct job effects, (b) indirect \njob effects, (c) induced job effects, and (d) second order growth effects. For each \nof these effects, the study will also outline the specific impact these projects had \non small and medium enterprises and the poor.  \n \n \n9.  Deliverables. The study will have the following deliverables: \n \n(i)  an approach paper specifying the methodology and a recommendation on the \nspecific projects to be included for the micro component;  \n(ii)  macro assessment: a report and set of slides that quantify the impact of power \non jobs and economic growth; \n(iii)  two micro studies on power projects in the Philippines that quantify the different \ntypes of job effects and include an assessment of impact on SMEs and the poor; \nand \n(iv)  a brief template that project teams in the Philippines can use to estimate job \neffects of power projects that may come up in future. \n \n6.  Let\u2019s Work Studies: Estimating Job Effects in Real Sector Investments \n10.  Selection of cases. The Let\u2019s Work Program will focus on three to five cases in the \nagribusiness and automotive sectors initially, which will be staggered to adjust timing based on \navailable resources and revisions needed to the methodology prior to scale-up. The cases with \nspecific clients in a given sector and/or subsector will be selected by the Let\u2019s Work steering \ncommittee to have a mix across regions and types of countries, including fragile and conflict- \naffected situations.  \n \n11.  Deliverables. Using and building upon findings from the literature to date, this work will \nestablish a range of multipliers in a specific sector, and possibly subsector, using real scenarios \nfaced by IFI clients. The aim is to obtain estimates for indirect jobs created pre- and post-IFI \nintervention  (and/or  specific  investment)  in  a  given  firm,  and  validate  these  multipliers  by \nconsulting  with  industry  associations  by  sector.  Multipliers  obtained  in  the  automotive  and \n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \nagribusiness  studies  may  be  applied  to  similar  contexts  based  on  sound  data  collection \nmethodology. The final output will be a publishable report drawn from the three to five case \nstudies to be conducted by Let\u2019s Work partners agreement on methodology and operational \ntools to be developed as part of this work will be sought based on consultations with technical \nexperts to obtain the most robust explanation in terms of the impact on jobs. \n \n12.  Following the report, the Let\u2019s Work program intends to plan related events to exchange \nknowledge among IFIs, private sector companies, policymakers, and researchers. Through at \nleast  one  to  two  workshops  with  stakeholders,  including  operational  staff,  the  Let\u2019s  Work \nprogram  aims  to  bridge  the  gap  among  practice,  research,  and  policy  when  designing \ninterventions expected to create jobs along the value chain and impacting local communities.  \n \nB.

The time spent on this component should be marginal. \n2 For indicators that measure private sector development, for example, such as innovation and technology and/or \nknow-how transfer, there is a question of whether to focus on the results at the project and/or client level or at the \noverall sector level. \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \n \n \n(e.g., can and/or should we estimate and/or disaggregate for gender, for low-\nincome beneficiaries, for indigenous beneficiaries). \n \nC.
