During the 2005 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare an integrated roads development project (the Project) in Heilongjiang \nProvince.1 ADB\u2019s fact-finding mission visited the project area in March 2005, carried out an \ninitial poverty and social assessment (IPSA) and rapid environmental assessment (REA), and \ncollected other necessary information. This paper is based on the understanding reached with \nthe Government regarding the objectives, scope, costs, consultants\u2019 terms of reference (TOR), \nand implementation arrangements for the TA, as well as the Mission\u2019s observations in the field. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  PRC\u2019s  economic  growth  since  the  1980s  has  resulted  in  an  unprecedented \nexpansion in intra- and inter-provincial traffic. The economy\u2019s changing structure and increasing \ndiversification  have  altered  the  transport  demand  pattern,  in  which  the  demand  for  road \ntransport has increased faster than that for other transport modes.2 The movement of goods and \npassengers by road is increasing rapidly, as road transport is more flexible and responsive than \nother modes to the needs of a market economy. The shift in transport demand also reflects the \nloosening of anticompetitive restrictions in the road transport industry. With the country\u2019s robust \neconomic growth, the expansion of vehicle fleets will maintain its fast pace in the coming years. \nHowever,  the  road  network  is  still  underdeveloped  in  both  quality  and  extent.  High-class \nhighways3 account for only 12% of the total network. The remaining 88% are medium- to low-\ngrade paved roads and gravel roads. The growing demand for road transport has thus put a \nstrain  on  the  road  infrastructure,  as  manifested  by  the  congestion  and  bottlenecks  in  the \nnetwork. Weaknesses in the road network have jacked up transport and logistics costs in plying \nbetween the interior provinces and the coastal ports.4 \n \n3.  Inadequate transport conditions bloat transportation costs to the rural poor and restrict \ntheir access to basic goods and services, especially since many of them reside in partial or full \nisolation.  Thus,  they  are  unable  to  take  advantage  of  job  opportunities  generated  by  the \ncountry\u2019s economic growth. Reliable transport would facilitate their access to input and output \nmarkets, thereby stimulating higher cash-crop production and speeding up the transition from \nsubsistence  farming  to  a  market  economy.  Upgraded  rural  transport  would  also  spur  the \ncreation of nonfarm income opportunities for the poor and make education and health facilities \nmore easily available to them. \n \n4.  The Government has infused massive investments in road infrastructure, in a concerted \neffort to boost the country\u2019s road capacity. The Government\u2019s road development policies are (i) \nconstructing expressways to expand the national trunk highway system to link all cities with a \npopulation of more than 500,000 and (ii) developing secondary roads, particularly those that will \nhelp reduce poverty and promote rural markets. To support the policies, the Government has \nalso prepared the Rural Road Development Plan to (i) link all county centers through high-class \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 February 2005. \n2  Between 1990 and 2004, road traffic grew around 9.0% per annum for passenger traffic, to reach 876.5 billion \npassenger-kilometers (km); and around 6.0% per annum for freight, to reach 759.7 billion ton-km. In 2004, road \ntraffic accounted for 53.7% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and 11.4% of total freight traffic. \n3  High-class highways include expressways, and class I and II highways. \n4  The shortage of adequate road networks has slowed economic growth and regional development. A World Bank \nstudy argued that the annual economic costs of not having adequate transport infrastructure in the PRC in the \n1980s amounted to 1% of its gross national product (World Bank. 1994. World Development Report 1994. \nWashington, DC). ", "2     \nhighways,  (ii)  connect  all  township  centers  with  paved  roads,  and  (iii)  ensure  that  all \nadministrative villages are serviced by all-weather roads. \n \n5.  As a result, the road network  has grown from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.86 million km in \n2004, an average annual increment of 81,300 km. Expressways have increased from 147 km in \n1988 to 34,200 km in 2004. Road density has grown from 12.1 km per 100 square kilometers \n(km2) in 1995 to 19.4 km per 100 km2 in 2004. The New Road Development Program (2003-\n2020) will expand the road network to over 3 million km, under which expressways will be \nfurther increased to 70,000 km. In 2004, Heilongjiang had a total road length of 66,821 km,  \n(0.4% of the PRC total), of which 13.2% were high-class highways: 1.1%, expressways; 1.6%, \nclass I; and 10.5%, class II. The province\u2019s road density in 2004 was 14.7 km per 100 km2. \n \n6.  Heilongjiang province is bounded by the PRC\u2019s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on \nthe west, the Russian Federation on the north, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea on \nthe east, and Jilin Province on the south. The province stands out for its fertile land and \nabundant natural resources. Of its 454,000 km2 area\u2014the 6th largest in the country\u201442% is \nforestland, and its cultivated land area (9.7 million hectares) is the largest in the country. \nHeilongjiang\u2019s population in 2003 was 38.2 million, of which 53% was urban, and its per capita \nGDP was CNY 11,615\u201428% higher than the national average. The industrial share of the GDP \nis 12%, 56%, and 33% for the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. About half of the total \nlabor force is absorbed by the primary industries, mainly agriculture and mining. The main \nindustrial sectors are petroleum, coal, power plant equipment, metallurgical, heavy machinery, \nspecial-hard steel, timber, and woodworking. Foreign trade is vital to Heilongjiang\u2019s economy; \nboth the international and domestic demand for its products have consistently risen. The total \nvalue of goods traded comprised about 10% of the province\u2019s GDP, and has grown over 20% \nper annum over the last 5 years. The province has 11 national ports open for foreign trade, \nlocated in the northern and eastern borders.  \n \n7.  Despite its strategic importance and economic potential, Heilongjiang has been left \nbehind by the coastal provinces, which have been pacing the country\u2019s economic growth. Its per \ncapita GDP in 2003 was only  50\u201370% of that of coastal provinces. In November 2003, the \nGovernment  embarked  on  a  grand  plan  of  revitalizing  the  northeast  region\u2014including \nHeilongjiang\u2014as an industrial hub, thereby attaining and sustaining economic growth of over \n10%. In support of the plan, the Ministry of Communications (MOC) drafted the northeast \nregional transport network development plan (TNDP) in September 2004, in collaboration with \nHeilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces. The plan aims to construct an integrated road-\nwaterway network in the region to catalyze economic development.5 The Heilongjiang Provincial \nCommunications  Department  (HPCD)  launched  the  province\u2019s  implementation  plan  for  the \nTNDP  (2005\u20132017),  to  stretch  the  improved  trunk  network  to  the  major  ports  to  facilitate \ninternational and regional trade.6 The key components are three radiate, four east-west, and six \nsouth-north highways, totaling 6,162 km.7 When the network is completed, an economic circle \nwill be formed, centered at Harbin, the provincial capital. Eleven out of the 13 cities or districts \nwill be within five hours\u2019 drive from Harbin.8 \n                                                 \n5  The network consists of 5 south-north highways, 8 east-west highways, 2 circumferential roads, and 10 linking \nroads. The combined length will stretch to 14,000 km, of which two-thirds will be expressways. \n6  The HPCD had prepared the 30-year investment program in 1998 under ADB. 1994. Technical Assistance to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for Provincial Highway Network Planning. Manila. The outcome of this TA provided the \nbasis of the provincial implementation plan for 2005\u20132017. \n7  By the time the network is completed in 2017, high-class highways will extend to 17,170 km in Heilongjiang. \n8  The economic circle will cover 47 counties and 86% of Heilongjiang\u2019s population; the area will produce 91% of the \nprovince\u2019s GDP. ", "    3\n8.  The proposed Project will upgrade or construct 459 km of the Jixi-Nehe highway. The \n828-km Jixi-Nehe highway is one of eight key east-west highways included in the TNDP; cutting \nacross the middle of Heilongjiang through 11 counties, this highway  is a major route connecting \nthe eastern and western parts of the province. However, more than a half of the corridor falls \nunder class III or IV highways, or gravel roads, in poor condition. Sections without any drainage \nsystem  are  impassable  during  winter  or  wet  seasons.  Traffic  congestion  due  to  bad  road \nconditions often causes transport costs to spiral. Likewise, the expansion of economic activities, \nincluding agricultural and industrial trade, is severely hampered by poor transport conditions. \nThe  Project,  consisting  of  five  sections,  will  upgrade  three  sections  urgently  needing \nimprovement  to  two-lane  class  II  highways  and  construct  two  new  sections9 with  class  II \nstandard\u2014the missing links in the Jixi-Nehe highway\u2014to strengthen integrated road networks in \nHeilongjiang, where the poverty incidence is high. \n \n9.  The project roads will link Jixi City, a coal producer in the east, four forest counties in the \nmiddle, and six agricultural counties in the west. The Project is connected with one expressway \n(Tongsan expressway), four national highways, and six provincial highways, forming part of the \ntrunk network that is vital to Heilongjiang and the northeast region. The travel time saved will be \nsubstantial, trimming around 24 hours off the trip from Jixi to Nehe. At present, the sections of \nthe roads that will comprise the Project are saturated with traffic, carrying a volume of 2,700\u2013\n3,500 medium truck equivalents per day. Traffic in some sections has been growing at more \nthan 12% annually in the past years. Overall, traffic in the project roads will grow 8\u20139% yearly \nby 2014. The Project is expected to increase the transport capacity and efficiency of the network \nin Heilongjiang, thereby catalyzing economic growth, spurring interregional trade, and reducing \npoverty in the project area. \n \n10.  The  project  area  has  limited  accessibility;  its  11  counties,  including  two  poverty-\ndesignated counties,  are mostly rural\u201467% of a population of 5.3 million. In 2004, the per \ncapita rural income was CNY 2,180 and the per capita GDP was CNY 5,400, less than half of \nthe provincial average of CNY 11,615. Above 18% of the rural population is defined as poor, \nwith annual per capita incomes of below CNY 900. Of 1,023 villages in the project area, 393 are \npoverty-designated. About 90% of the villages in the project area do not have adequate access \nto all-weather roads. Due to difficult transport conditions, rural people in the area have to pay \nhigh rates for motorized transport, have insufficient access to markets, and have little mobility \nbeyond their immediate communities. The main causes of poverty in the project area include (i) \nlimited road access to markets where farming products are sold, (ii) a decline in the timber \nindustry due to restrictions on tree cutting, and (iii) inadequate delivery of road infrastructure and \nservices. During the fact-finding mission, the IPSA reviewed the need for a comprehensive \nassessment of the social context and concluded that the key issues to be analyzed during \nproject preparation are a full resettlement plan (RP) and the socioeconomic impacts of the \nProject. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s operating strategy in the PRC\u2019s road sector is designed to remove infrastructure \nconstraints and support policy and institutional reforms. Since 1991, ADB has provided 30 loans \ntotaling $5.6 billion to finance about 4,100 km of highway development. To make ADB\u2019s road \nprojects more pro-poor, the local roads have been included in project scopes since 1995. A \nportion of some ADB loans has been used to finance the local road component.10 To promote \npro-poor  economic  growth,  ADB  strategy  extends  its  operations  to  the  local  roads  at  the \nprovincial, county, and municipal levels. In line with ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the Project will finance \n                                                 \n9 The Project will construct a 2.2 km bridge across the Songhua River to connect Tonghe County to the expressway \nnetwork, and a 22-km new road in the mountainous Tonghe County. \n10 Ningxia Roads Development Project, Hunan Roads Development II Project, and Guangxi Road Development II \nProject. ", "4     \nthe upgrading of the provincial roads to class II highways (para. 8), and the improvement of 11 \ntownship roads (totaling 60 km) linking the towns to the county center will be integrated into the \nproject. The local road component will ensure the favorable distribution of the Project\u2019s benefits \nto the poor in the area. \n \n12.  The strategy supports (i) the construction of the roads that connect major growth centers \nwith hinterland economies; (ii) the integration of the network, so that the major trunk highways \nare supported by a system of local roads, particularly those that provide access to poor areas; \n(iii)  the  adequate  delivery  of  affordable  transport  services  to  the  poor;  (iv)  adequate  road \nmaintenance; (v) the promotion of road safety; (vi) private sector participation in the road sector; \n(vii) institutional strengthening to increase financial and managerial efficiency in operation and \nmaintenance; and (viii) the adoption of appropriate pricing policies to ensure the optimum use of \nroad transport capacity. \n \n13.   The feasibility study for the Project was submitted to MOC in  March 2005 and its \napproval is expected by March 2006. The completion of the preliminary design is expected by \nAugust 2005. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) will be completed by July 2005. The \npreparation of the RP will start in June 2005 and be completed by October 2005. The IPSA and \nREA carried out during fact-finding identified the key social and environmental issues that will \nneed to be analyzed further during project preparation (Appendix 2). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The project preparatory technical assistance will help the Government prepare a road \nnetwork development project to support pro-poor economic growth and reduce poverty in the \nproject area. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The  TA  will  assist  HPCD  in  (i)  refining  the  feasibility  study,  including  an  EIA  and \nsummary EIA, RP, and poverty impact analysis for the proposed Project, in conformity with \nADB\u2019s requirements; (ii) designing the project log framework, identifying performance targets \nand socioeconomic impact indicators, and baseline data, and establishing measuring/monitoring \nmechanism;  (iii)  confirming  the  technical,  economic,  and  financial  viability  of  the  proposed \ninvestments; (iv) updating transport and road profiles; and (v) reviewing the road sector issues \nand providing the basis for strengthening the ongoing policy dialogue with the Government in \nkey areas, such as the impact of road projects on poverty reduction, road safety and vehicle \nemissions, local road maintenance, public transport services, intelligent transport system and \nasset management, and private sector participation in the road sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000, of which $357,000 is the foreign \nexchange component and the equivalent of $268,000, the local currency cost. ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram will provide a $500,000 grant to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of \nthe local currency cost (the equivalent of $143,000). HPCD will finance the remainder of the \ntotal TA cost (the equivalent of $125,000), which will be used to cover office accommodation \nand support services, local communications, local transport, office supplies, and other facilities \nand services required for the implementation of the TA. The detailed cost estimates are in ", "    5\nAppendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  A team of international consultants, in association with domestic consulting firm(s), will \nbe engaged, using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method, ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. The TA will \nrequire a total of 30 person-months of consulting services, including 13 person-months of \ninternational and 17 person-months of domestic consultancy, to carry out the study, as defined \nin the outline TOR (Appendix 4). The international consultants will provide expertise in (i) \nhighway and structural engineering, including traffic forecast and maintenance; (ii) transport \neconomics; (iii) financial analysis and private sector participation in the road sector; (iv) poverty \nand  socioeconomic  analyses  including  transport  services  and  roadside  stations;  and  (v) \nenvironmental  aspects.  The  domestic  consultants    will  have  expertise  in  (i)  highway  and \nstructural engineering, (ii) transport economics and financial analysis, (iii) socioeconomic and \npoverty impact analysis, (iv) resettlement, and (v) environment engineering. \n \n18.  HPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  and  will  be  responsible  for  the \nsupervision  and  monitoring  of  TA  activities  and  liaison  with  government  agencies  and \norganizations. HPCD will also provide office accommodation and transport arrangements. The \nfielding of consultants is scheduled for early September 2005; consulting services will be carried \nout over a 6-month period, to be completed in February 2006. HPCD will provide ADB and the \nconsultants with the feasibility study; engineering studies; EIA; RP; and all other materials, \nrecent studies, and reports required  to implement the TA. The consultants will maintain close \ncontact with the Government and HPCD, and keep them informed of the progress and findings. \nTripartite meetings involving HPCD, ADB staff, and the consultants will be held in the PRC to \nadvise and guide the consultants and review their reports. The consultants will procure the \nequipment they need under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n19.   The consultants will submit to ADB and HPCD the following reports: (i) an inception \nreport,  including  a  survey  implementation  plan  with  a  proposed  questionnaire  for \nsocioeconomic, resettlement, and poverty-reduction impacts, 2 weeks after commencement of \ntheir services; (ii) an interim report, 8 weeks after commencement of services, which will provide \na draft project log framework along with socioeconomic impact indicators and their baseline \nvalues,  assess the need for an ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP) in accordance with \nADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples\u2019,  and  present  an  initial  assessment  in  the  areas  of \neconomic, financial, and poverty analyses; (iii) a draft final report, the final project framework, \nsummary EIA, draft RP, draft EMDP, and draft social and poverty assessment report, 14 weeks \nafter commencement of services; and (vi) the final report, summary EIA, RP, social and poverty \nassessment report, and EMDP, 2 weeks after receiving comments from ADB and HPCD.

Poverty Analysis                                               Targeting Classification: General intervention         \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty is caused by (i) geographical remoteness and isolation; (ii) inadequate and irregular irrigation; (ii) collapse of the \ntimber industry due to restrictions on cutting trees (iii) lack of knowledge and technical skills in cash-crop farming and \nanimal husbandry, (iv) limited access to credit and development investment; and (v) poor infrastructure. The project area \nincludes one national level poverty county, one provincial level poverty county and other low income counties. \n \nPoverty analysis will be carried out to identify causes of poverty, prepare a complementary local roads program, quantify \nhow the Project will help reduce poverty and incorporate other social measures within the project scope. It will focus on \nthe poverty impact of the proposed interventions on the poor and disadvantaged, including the impact of enhanced \nprovision of transport services for the poor. The analysis will follow the Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis and \nHandbook for Integrating Poverty Impact on Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. Poverty mapping will help \ndetermine the correlation between poverty, minority nationality, topography, and transport systems. Recommendations \nfrom the analysis will be considered for possible inclusion into project design. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis. A stakeholder analysis will be conducted to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related \ninterests, and the ways in which they affect project feasibility and success.  Public consultation will be carried out by the \nExecuting Agency, local government officials, design institute, and other institutes during preparation of the feasibility \nstudy,  poverty  and  social  assessment,  environmental  impact  assessment,  resettlement  plan,  and  ethnic  minority \nassessment. Primary stakeholders include farmers, people and institutions affected by land acquisition and resettlement, \nminority people, vulnerable groups, freight and passenger enterprises, drivers and passengers, tourism, and mining \nenterprises. It is suggested that the role of NGOs be considered during project planning and implementation. \n \n \nParticipation strategy required. A participation strategy will be required to take into account different levels of \ncooperation and collaboration of stakeholders vertically and laterally. This will help ensure political support, active \nparticipation and consultation of concerned groups, productive feedback, and project success. The participatory process \nwill involve information sharing, consultation, focus group meetings, and collaborative decision-making. Participation and \nconsultation efforts should be enhanced during project preparation, and consultation recorded and disseminated. \n \n \nD.         Gender and Development \nTransport infrastructure is often considered gender-neutral, as the impacts and benefits will be felt at the household level. \nHowever, past experience has shown that socioeconomic development statistics for rural women--especially from ethnic \nminority groups--such as education, employment, and mobility are lower than for men. This limits women\u2019s ability to \npartake in and fully benefit from economic development. A gender analysis in line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment is required. Data will be disaggregated by gender. Ways for incorporating gender aspects or mitigating \nadverse impacts will be investigated for inclusion in  the project design, the measures for ethnic minorities, and the \nresettlement plan.  \n \n \nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n  Significant,  \nNot Significant,  Strategy to Address Issues  Plan \nUncertain,    Required \nNone \nResettlement  Significant  A  resettlement  plan  (RP)  will  be  prepared  following  the  Land  A full RP \nAdministration Law and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \nThe  RP will be disclosed to the public and affected people. Internal \nand external monitoring arrangements will be put in place. \nAffordability  Uncertain  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HPCD)  has  None \nimplemented other road projects.
