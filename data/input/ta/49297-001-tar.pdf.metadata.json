INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since 2011, Myanmar has been undergoing far-ranging political, economic, and social \ntransformations. While the reform progress has been impressive, the development challenges \nremain daunting given the highly complex operating context. Development partners have been \nresponding  to  the  country\u2019s  development  challenges  and  related  reforms  by  significantly \nincreasing development assistance to Myanmar.1 However, limited government capacities are \nposing major challenges to effectiveness of development assistance. \n \n2.  The Government of Myanmar has requested capacity development technical assistance \n(TA),  including  the  establishment  of  standard  protocols  for  engagement  and  project \nimplementation, to enhance its management of development assistance. The TA was discussed \nduring  the  2015  country  programming  mission.  During  the  TA  fact-finding  mission,  the \ngovernment concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, and key activities in the design and \nmonitoring framework in Appendix 1. 2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Development challenges. The operating environment in Myanmar is shaped by at least \nthree significant challenges: (i) maintaining stability both on the macroeconomic front in a testing \nglobal economic environment and in Myanmar\u2019s conflict-affected areas as efforts toward a \nsustainable peace agreement continue; (ii) tackling the infrastructure, human resource, and \ncapacity deficits that constrain social and economic development; and (iii) keeping up the reform \ndrive  toward  stronger  governance,  effective  public  sector  management,  and  a  conducive \nbusiness environment. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s  reengagement  in  Myanmar.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  began \nreengaging with Myanmar in early 2012 and has since made solid progress in (i) establishing \nrelationships and dialogue with the government, civil society, the private sector, and other \ndevelopment partners; (ii) preparing an interim country partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2012\u2013\n2014  (extended  to  2016);3 (iii)  providing  knowledge  and  capacity-building  support;  and \n(iv) resuming  lending  operations  and  building  a  significant  operational  program  with  both \nsovereign  and  nonsovereign  lending  and  nonlending  modalities.  A  full  country  partnership \nstrategy (2017\u20132021) is being prepared.  \n \n5.  Capacity development. Stronger public sector capacities are critical to the delivery of \ngovernment  services,  and  to  the  effectiveness  of  international  development  assistance. \nCapacity constraints among civil servants and institutional weaknesses in project management \nremain apparent and affect the pace of processing and implementation of development projects. \nThis concern is increasing as the operational Myanmar portfolios of development partners, \nincluding  ADB,  grow  and  require  a  closely  coordinated  approach  to  resolving  common \noperational implementation issues. As programmatic approaches are adopted in key sectors, \nADB's  capacity  development  efforts  will  expand  from  project-specific  activities  to  sector \n                                                 \n1  Programmable  official  development  assistance  has  been  estimated  at  $3.8  billion  in  2013  from  about  45 \ndevelopment partners. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 30 September 2015. \n3  ADB. 2012. Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Myanmar, 2012\u20132014. Manila. ADB\u2019s operational focus is on \n(i) building human resources and capacity, (ii) promoting an enabling economic environment, and (iii) creating \naccess and connectivity (through infrastructure and rural development).

Manila. \n ", "2   \nmanagement and country system development, to boost the overall portfolio performance of \nMyanmar  operations.  ADB  has  established  collaboration  networks  with  other  funding \nagencies\u2014such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the World Bank\u2014to \nensure development effectiveness.  \n \n6.  Strengthening country systems. In 2015, ADB, JICA, and the World Bank carried out \nthe first joint country portfolio review in Myanmar, under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF),  to  identify  and  tackle  cross-cutting  implementation  challenges  such  as  unclear \noperational  procedures  and  approval  processes  that  impact  portfolio  performance  and \nadministration.  The  review  pinpointed  the  need  to  raise  the  awareness  and  capacity  of \ngovernment counterparts to implement policies and standards.  It also agreed on a joint action \nplan to solve the main cross-cutting implementation issues in the areas of (i) project administration; \n(ii)  procurement;  (iii)  financial  management;  (iv)  social  and  environmental  safeguards;  (v) \nstakeholder engagement (communication, consultation, participation) including civil society and \nlocal  communities;  and  (vi)  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  proposed  TA  will  support \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  the  action  plan,  as  well  as  the  coordination  and \nimplementation  of  future  joint  country  portfolio  reviews.  The  experiences  of  other  regional \ndeveloping member countries will provide useful insights and lessons for Myanmar. \n \n7.  Safeguard  issues.  Assessing and addressing social and environmental safeguards \npose a major challenge in Myanmar and affect development partners\u2019 ability to effectively \ndeliver  their  lending  programs.  Environmental  safeguards  are  being  strengthened  under  a \nseparate TA, which builds on earlier-developed procedures for implementing environmental \nimpact  assessments.4 Much  remains  to  be  accomplished,  however,  with  respect  to  social \nsafeguards,  particularly  in  relation  to  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  people.  The \ncurrent capacity for effective application of social safeguards is limited, partly because of weak \npolicies and regulations, and a weak institutional framework. In particular, concerns persist \nabout  land  disputes  and  unsettled  land  tenure  issues,  as  well  as  relations  with  ethnic \nnationalities, center\u2013state relations, and fair and equal access to resources. ADB\u2019s efforts to \nbridge gaps in social safeguards at the national level are at this stage limited to action planning \nand  capacity  building  for  social  assessment. 5  A  capacity  development  assistance  plan \ndelineates the extensive needs of the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry \n(MOECAF), the coordinator of social safeguard issues, in developing the ability to implement \nand  apply  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  guidelines.  Discussions  about \ncollaboration on country safeguard systems between ADB, JICA, and the World Bank, among \nother development partners, civil society, as well as other related government agencies, are \nunderway.6  \n \n8.  Context sensitivity. Context-sensitive development has particular relevance for Myanmar \ngiven the multiple ethnic conflicts experienced by the country for many decades. Operating in \nsuch country context requires detailed analysis of the political economy, state\u2013society and \nstate\u2013non-state  relations,  system  capacities,  and  the  ways  ADB  interventions  can  support \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2014.

The accord included a commitment to the establishment of national guidelines for social \nand environmental impact assessments, and ADB was subsequently assigned lead development partner on this \nissue.  \n ", "  3 \neconomic development through a holistic and coordinated approach. ADB is applying lessons \nfrom other post-conflict countries in the region to integrate a context-sensitive approach into its \nMyanmar  operations,  and  build  capacity  in  relevant  government  agencies.  This  approach \naffirms ADB\u2019s support to fragile and conflict-affected countries, based on a deep understanding \nof the local context, a long-term engagement, and broader ownership of its operations by \ngovernments  and  civil  society.7 It  will  also  contribute  to  improved  project  implementation. \nDelivering effective services to conflict-affected regions is essential if the cycle of poverty, \nviolence, distrust, and instability is to be broken. Accordingly, ADB is taking a context-sensitive \napproach in Myanmar to (i) developing strategic guidance for the country partnership strategy \npreparation and implementation; (ii) ensuring that all ADB operations are subject to context \nsensitivity analysis and action; and (iii) raising awareness and capacity within the Myanmar \ncountry team of the broad issues, and providing in-depth training for those operating in conflict-\naffected areas. Continuing assistance is required to further mainstream context sensitivity in \nADB\u2019s Myanmar operations.8  \n \n9.  Stakeholder engagement. Recognizing that civil society has an important role to play \nand stakeholder engagement is instrumental for aid effectiveness in Myanmar, the government \nhas taken measures to improve the aid architecture accordingly.9 ADB has prepared a plan to \nguide  its  engagement  with  civil  society  and  local  communities,  including  guidelines  for \nmeaningful consultations, programs to assist project implementation, and a work plan to guide \nADB  engagement  activities. 10 The  plan  recognizes  the  cross-cutting  nature  of stakeholder \nengagement and aims to strengthen the links and synergies in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.11 \nTo support the implementation of this plan and advise the ADB country team on operational \nissues related to stakeholder engagement and consultation, a Myanmar\u2013ADB Civil Society \nAdvisory Group was established in 2015. It comprises representatives from pertinent local and \ninternational nongovernment organizations. Continued engagement with civil society on ADB \nstrategies and operations will be critical for ADB\u2019s development effectiveness in Myanmar. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA impact will be strengthened effectiveness of projects funded by development \npartners. The outcome will be the improved capacity of the government to implement projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  help  improve  government  capacity  for  absorbing  external  development \nassistance and effectively implementing projects through three main outputs. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2014.

Output 1: Improved project cycle management. The TA will help improve project \nmanagement  systems  and  capacity  for  project  processing  and  administration  (including \nprocurement  and  financial  management).  It  will  achieve  this  by  developing  consistent \nprocedures and practices where appropriate, and implementing capacity development programs \nin critical areas. It will contribute to the development of project readiness filters, establishment of \nservice  standard  levels,  improvement  of  advance  actions,  and  greater  transparency  and \naccountability  in  public  procurement  and  financial  management.  These  activities  will  be \nembodied in manuals and guidelines. MOF and the Ministry of National Planning and Economic \nDevelopment (MNPED) will be the key government counterparts for this output. The executing \nand implementing agencies with which international development finance agencies are engaged \nwill be beneficiaries.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Stronger social safeguard systems. The TA will help strengthen national \nsocial safeguard systems and capacity, specifically those concerning involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. It will achieve this by supporting MOECAF (as the coordinator of social \nsafeguard issues) to develop and monitor national systems, including through the establishment \nof a social safeguard unit; and by strengthening executing and implementing agency capacities \nto implement and monitor social safeguard activities, including the establishment of grievance \nredress mechanisms. Manuals and guidelines will be produced to support these activities. This \noutput will benefit MOECAF, central agencies, and executing and implementing agencies that \ninternational development finance agencies are engaged with.   \n \n14.  Output  3:  Enhanced  context  sensitivity.  The  TA  will  enhance  context  sensitivity \nembodied in development programs by bolstering awareness of and institutional capacity for \ncivil  society  engagement,  conflict-sensitive  approaches,  comprehensive  communication \nstrategies, and stakeholder consultations, particularly in relation to project and program design \nand implementation. These activities will build on ongoing work by ADB and other partners on \nthe implementation of best-practice consultation and participation approaches in Myanmar, and \nwill  involve  manuals  and  guidelines  to  support  related  activities.  In  particular,  the  TA  will \nstrengthen the capacities of central agencies and of the executing and implementing agencies \ninvolved in project implementation to carry out meaningful consultations with local populations \non development projects, to formulate and implement communication strategies, and to engage \nconstructively with civil society in project-affected areas. \n \n15.  Risks. The key risks to the TA are (i) changing government regulations and inadequate \nconsultations with the development partner community, (ii) frequently changing counterpart staff, \n(iii) inadequate commitment and support by the government and other development partners to \nincrease the alignment and harmonization of development plans and operational procedures, \nand (iv) low capacity of concerned agencies to provide timely data or information and feedback. \nThe first three risks are considered minimal given ADB\u2019s strong development partnership with \nthe government, and the demand for the TA activities from MNPED, MOF, and MOECAF. In \nresponse to the fourth risk, ADB will assist in providing support and capacity development to \nimprove data collection and monitoring. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,050,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff (salaries and per diem), local travel \nfor site visits, logistical assistance to organize events, access to all relevant information, staff, \ndata and reports, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will finance (i) expert inputs, (ii) costs \n ", "  5 \nof training activities and other workshops, (iii) print and electronic resource materials, (iv) and \nother allowable expenditures as agreed by ADB (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MNPED will be the executing agency for the overall TA, and the implementing agency \nfor output 3. MOF will be the implementing agency for output 1, and MOECAF the implementing \nagency for output 2. ADB\u2019s Myanmar Resident Mission will assist in TA implementation, in close \ncollaboration with sector and thematic resources from ADB headquarters. The TA activities will \nbe implemented in close consultation with key executing and implementing agencies involved in \nother projects supported by development partners. They will be delivered in close collaboration \nwith other development partners (particularly international funding agencies such as JICA and \nthe World Bank). Civil society and other key stakeholders will be involved. ADB staff, including \nsocial safeguard officers and portfolio officers from its headquarters, will contribute to events as \nresource persons. \n \n18.  The TA is anticipated to require 85 person-months of international and 50 person-\nmonths of national consulting services (Appendix 3). It is expected that the consultants will be \nengaged using individual consultant selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Individual consultant selection, rather \nthan through a firm, is appropriate in this instance because the TA involves multiple activities \nthat are not necessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of consultants and \nservices. However, where suitable, recruitment through a firm will be considered. To reduce the \nadministrative  burden\u2014and  improve  economy,  efficiency,  and  value  for money\u2014consulting \nservices  under  the  TA  will  be  engaged  on  output-based  (lump-sum)  contracts  wherever \nappropriate.  ADB\u2019s  Myanmar  Resident  Mission  will  administer  the  training,  seminars,  and \nconferences carried out under the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Any procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented from 1 January \n2016 to 31 December 2018.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n19.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of Myanmar to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Capacity Development \nfor Project Implementation. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact of the TA is aligned with the 2013 Nay Pyi Taw Accord for Effective Development Cooperation \nfor strengthened effectiveness of projects funded by development partnersa \n \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019     \n \nImproved  a.
