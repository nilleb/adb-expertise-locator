INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes gender equity as an essential driver of \nchange in achieving inclusive development, and emphasizes gender mainstreaming in all ADB \noperations.1 For the  Pacific  developing member  countries  (DMCs),  ADB  aims  to  introduce \ngender as a key policy concern in the core functioning of governments by enhancing gender \nawareness in all capacity- and institution-building efforts.2 A 2008 regional technical assistance \n(TA)  project  assessed  gender  mainstreaming  capacity  in  governments  of  selected  Pacific \nDMCs.3 The  results  indicate  a  great  need  to  improve  gender  awareness  across  Pacific \ngovernments and to develop institutional and technical capacities of government agencies to \npromote gender equity.    \n \n2.  The TA for Promoting Evidence-Based Policy Making for Gender Equity in the Pacific \nseeks to strengthen the capacity of governments in selected Pacific DMCs to systematically \nmonitor gender situations and address gender inclusiveness in development strategies. Fact-\nfinding missions were undertaken during June\u2013September 2010 to the Fiji Islands, Papua New \nGuinea, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste. All the governments requested support for capacity \ndevelopment,  especially  for  staff  of  women\u2019s  offices  and  sector  gender  focal  points,  in \nmonitoring  gender  inequalities  and  promoting  gender  mainstreaming  across  government \nministries.  The  objective,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  and  financing \narrangements, and terms of references for the TA are based on the understanding reached with \nthe governments during the missions.4 The design and monitoring framework for the TA is \npresented in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Pacific DMCs share common concerns and challenges in achieving social and \neconomic development goals, including gender equity. Many Pacific countries rank very low in \nthe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  human  development  and  gender-related \ndevelopment indexes, with poor performance on the basic health and education indicators, \nparticularly among women. In countries such as Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and \nTimor-Leste, the gender gap in school enrollment persists together with low enrollment rates. \nMaternal  mortality  rates for  these  countries  are  among the  highest  in  the  world  with  little \nindication of improvement, reflecting the lack of women\u2019s empowerment at various levels. In \naddition, low participation of women in the economy and decision-making positions, along with \nwidespread gender-based violence, are critical concerns for improving women\u2019s status.   \n \n4.  Across  the  Pacific  DMCs,  gender  awareness  has  been  gradually  increasing  with \nratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women \n(CEDAW)5 and  with  growing  emphasis  on  gender  equality  by  international  and  regional \nagencies. Yet, there have been few systematic and concerted policy efforts to address gender \nconcerns in national development strategies across the Pacific DMCs. This lack of systematic \neffort reflects weak government capacity overall and poor technical capacity of government \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2009. ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Pacific Economic Analysis and Policy Development. Manila. \nThe  assessment  was  undertaken  as  the  gender  thematic  component  of  this  TA,  in  collaboration  with  the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 November 2010. \n5  Except for Nauru, Palau, and Tonga, all of ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs have ratified CEDAW.     \n ", "2   \nagencies that represent women\u2019s interests in the national policy agenda. In particular, women\u2019s \nministries and sector gender focal points often lack technical capacity to assess and monitor \ngender disparities in key social and economic areas, which is essential for articulating gender \nconcerns and developing targeted policies. Moreover, limited availability of empirical data in the \nPacific and limited capability to use existing information hinder the capacity of policy makers to \nmake informed decisions on gender issues.   \n \n5.  Recently, progress has been made in collecting administrative and statistical data in \nmany Pacific DMCs, including sex-disaggregated statistics. Despite increasing availability of \nempirical  data,  the  data  have  not  been  effectively  utilized  in  measuring,  monitoring,  and \nassessing gender disparities, let alone in  assisting informed policy making on gender and \ndevelopment  issues.  Collecting  and  analyzing  gender  indicators  is  crucial  for  developing \ntargeted measures to reduce gender disparities, as well as for monitoring the outcomes of \nimplemented policies or programs. Regular collection and dissemination of gender indicators \ncan  also  facilitate  working  relationships  across  government  agencies,  increase  gender \nawareness among policy makers, and promote gender mainstreaming in government programs \nand donor-assisted development projects. In addition, regular monitoring of gender disparities \nbased  on  empirical  data  provides  an  important  tool  to  evaluate  resource  allocations  in \ngovernment planning, programming, and budgeting.     \n \n6.  To facilitate integration of gender concerns in the national development strategies of \nPacific DMCs, it is important to increase gender awareness and support capacity building both \nin governments and civil society. This can be achieved by promoting evidence-based policy \nmaking on gender issues. Improving the technical capacity of women\u2019s ministries and gender \nfocal points to utilize empirical information, monitor gender situations, and disseminate the \nfindings across government ministries and civil society are essential elements of evidence-\nbased  policy  making.  This  process  in  turn  will  create  an  enabling  institutional  and  policy \nenvironment that advances gender mainstreaming and gender equity.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be the attainment of gender-inclusive development in selected \nPacific DMCs. The expected outcome of the TA is improved capacity of women\u2019s ministries and \nsector gender focal points to promote evidence-based, gender-inclusive policy development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  support  capacity  development  of  key  government  agencies,  especially \nwomen\u2019s offices and sector gender focal points, for evidence-based policy making on gender \nissues.  The  TA  outputs  will  be  delivered  through  (i)  the  compilation  of  baseline  gender \nindicators, (ii) country gender assessments (CGAs), (iii) gender awareness training and gender-\ninclusive policy development, and (iv) regional knowledge sharing on gender disparities in \nPacific DMCs.   \n \n9.  The countries participating in the TA are the Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea, Solomon \nIslands, and Timor-Leste. These are the largest countries in the Pacific, and they face various \ngender-related  constraints  in  alleviating  poverty,  fostering  economic  growth,  and  ensuring \ninclusive development. In Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste, women\u2019s \npoor human resources, lack of access to economic opportunities, and pervasive gender-based ", "  3 \nviolence  have  been  highlighted  as  serious  barriers  to  the  country\u2019s  development.  These \ncountries have also lacked reliable empirical information for many years, making systematic \nassessments of gender disparities or promotion of evidence-based policy making on gender \nconcerns difficult. In the Fiji Islands, deteriorating economic opportunities for women have been \na growing developmental concern; yet, a comprehensive gender analysis has been lacking to \nassess the situation. The TA is timely for these countries, given that they all have recently \nconducted important national surveys such as the household income and expenditure survey. \nThis allows the TA to use the most up-to-date empirical information in undertaking tasks on \ngender indicators, gender analyses, and country gender assessments.    \n \n10.  Output  1:  Baseline  key  gender  indicators  are  compiled  and  maintained  by \nwomen\u2019s  offices.  The  TA  will  help  women\u2019s  ministries  and  sector  gender  focal  points  \n(i) compile baseline gender indicators from existing administrative and statistical data sources; \nand (ii) establish a central, easy-to-use database that can be updated regularly as new data \nbecome available. In view of the lack of technical capacity among women\u2019s ministry officials and \ngender focal points, the TA will provide in-country training on sex-disaggregated statistics, \nincluding a mapping of their data sources and their uses in assessing and monitoring gender \ninequality. It will also assist in establishing an interministerial network involving key government \nagencies such as the national statistics office (NSO), through which data need to be gathered \nand updated periodically. For countries that already have a working group on data gathering \ninvolving gender issues, such as Millennium Development Goal indicators or CEDAW status \nreports, the TA will assist in facilitating these working groups to compile gender indicators. A \ncentral database containing key gender indicators will be established either within the women\u2019s \nministry or in the NSO, and will be updated regularly. The compiled indicators will be posted on \nthe NSO website. To harmonize with other data collection efforts by regional and international \ninstitutions, the list of key gender indicators will be established based on a regional gender \nindicator framework developed by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC),6 and data \ncompilation activities will be conducted in collaboration with the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).7   \n \n11.  Output  2:  A  participatory,  evidence-based  country  gender  assessment  is \ncompleted in each participating DMC. A CGA will be undertaken in each participating country \nto obtain an in-depth understanding of gender disparities in each sector, to diagnose gender-\nrelated barriers to inclusive social and economic development, and to recommend specific \nstrategies to improve existing gender-related barriers. To achieve these goals, the CGAs will \ninvolve (i) conducting a gender analysis of national surveys for issues such as education, \nhealth,  economic  participation,  access to  assets  and  productive  resources,  and  household \ndecision-making; (ii) incorporating findings from other gender research or specialized surveys \nsuch as gender-based violence; (iii) reviewing legal, policy, and institutional frameworks on \ngender equity; and (iv) assessing gender outcomes of major development or donor-assisted \nprojects in key sectors. Along with these analytic components, the CGAs will be undertaken with \nparticipation  by  government  ministries,  women  stakeholders,  civil  society  groups,  and \ndevelopment partners. The TA will emphasize country ownership of the CGA so that its specific \nassessments  and  recommendations  can  be  incorporated  in the government\u2019s  development \nstrategies. Therefore, the structure of CGAs will vary from country to country to address the \nspecific gender concerns of each country. The CGAs will be carried out in collaboration with \n                                                \n6  SPC, a regional intergovernment organization, provides technical, research, and training services to its 26 Pacific \nmember countries. The SPC headquarters is in Noumea, New Caledonia.   \n7  The TA will provide additional support for regional efforts on gender indicators which will be undertaken by SPC in \ncountries other than the TA\u2019s participating countries. This will include the Marshall Islands and Tonga.  \n ", "4   \nother development partners in each country, with each partner providing analytic inputs or \ngeneral support to the assessment of sectors in their priority operations.   \n \n12.  Output 3: Gender awareness is increased among government staff for gender-\ninclusive  policy  development.  The  TA  will  help  women\u2019s  offices  and  other  ministries \ndisseminate the CGA findings widely across government ministries and civil society groups \nthrough national media events or meetings. Dissemination efforts will be aimed at (i) increasing \ngender awareness among policy makers as well as in civil society; (ii) addressing gaps in \ngovernment  development  strategies  to  improve  gender-related  barriers;  and  (iii)  identifying \npriority areas for developing policy measures or government programs to improve women\u2019s \nsituations. Based on priority areas identified, the TA will support women\u2019s ministry officers or \nsector gender focal points to draft specific gender strategies, action plans, or sector programs. \nThe TA will also organize gender awareness training sessions for government officials in sector \nministries and for managers of development projects to increase their understanding of gender \naspects  of  development  and  foster  gender  mainstreaming  in  development  strategies  and \nprojects. The TA will provide capacity building support through existing mechanisms established \nby  other  development  partners  in  each  country.  By  cooperating  and  collaborating  with \ndevelopment partners already working on gender issues (e.g., the United Nations Development \nFund for Women), the TA aims to consolidate and strengthen ongoing efforts for capacity \nbuilding and gender-inclusive development.    \n \n13.  Output  4:  Awareness  of  gender  disparities  in  the  region  is  enhanced  among \nPacific DMCs. The TA will support the production of a regional publication on Pacific gender \nindicators based on those compiled by each participating country under this TA, along with \nthose compiled by SPC in other Pacific countries. The regional product will help each Pacific \ncountry better understand its own gender situations in comparison with other Pacific countries. \nThis  regional  product  will  be  shared  at  regional  events  to  enhance  the  understanding  of \ncommon challenges in improving gender situations and to address possible gender strategies \nthroughout the Pacific.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,640,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $1,450,000 on a \ngrant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV  and  TASF-other \nsources).8 The governments of the four participating DMCs will provide in-kind contributions with \nremuneration of counterpart staff totaling $100,000. UNESCAP will contribute the balance of \n$90,000 equivalent with the provision of staff time and administrative support.  The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from January 2011 to June 2013.  ADB will be the executing \nagency and will be responsible for overall management and monitoring of the TA activities.   \n \n16.  The TA will require a total of 102 person-months of international and national consulting \nservices.  This  includes  45  person-months  of  international  consulting  services,  31  person-\nmonths of national consulting services, and 26 person-months of ADB headquarters-based \nnational  TA  coordinator  contributions.  ADB  will  engage  the  international  and  national \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \n                                                \n8  The TA will be financed by the combination of TASF-IV ($880,000) and TASF-other sources ($570,000).   ", "  5 \nfrom time to time). All consultants will be recruited individually and selected on the basis of their \nqualifications  for  the  assignment.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  \nAppendix 3. All procurement of goods or equipment will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).   \n \n17.  UNESCAP will be the implementing agency for activities related to gender indicators. It \nwill provide a statistician to assist the participating DMCs with (i) establishment of key gender \nindicators; (ii) compilation of gender statistics from administrative and statistical data sources; \nand (iii) in-country training to government staff on gender statistics. No objection letter from the \nparticipating  DMCs  will  be  obtained  before  TA  activities  begin  in  each  country.  TA \nimplementation agreement outlining the roles and responsibilities will be signed between ADB \nand UNESCAP before the TA is implemented. An advance payment facility will be established \nto provide for UNESCAP travel expenses in connection with TA implementation in participating \nDMCs.9 Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  gender \nindicators compiled under the TA will be harmonized based on the SPC regional framework, \nand  be  provided  to the  SPC  regional  database  and  to  UNESCAP.  SPC  will  serve  as  an \nadditional implementing agency in supporting regional activities related to gender indicators, \nincluding  the  compilation  of  gender  indicators  in  additional  Pacific  countries  such  as  the \nMarshall Islands and Tonga, and the regional publication and dissemination of gender indicators.       \n \n18.  Progress will be monitored using the intended outcomes and outputs described in the \ndesign and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. The consultants will provide quarterly progress \nreports  and  completion  reports,  detailing  the  work  programs  and  achievements  of  their \nrespective TA activities.  ADB will conduct periodic review missions to monitor TA activities. The \nTA results will be disseminated to participating DMCs as knowledge products and through \nregional events.   \n \nIV.
