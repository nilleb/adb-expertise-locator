Justification \n \n1.  The proposed project will establish a dedicated green financing platform in the greater \nBeijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region to leverage financing in a sustainable manner to demonstrate \nand scale-up investments in different economic sectors that arrest environment degradation, \ncontribute to climate change mitigation and sustainable economic development through financial \ninnovation. 1  The  proposed  green  financing  platform  will  introduce  innovative  financial \ninstruments recommended in the recently issued Green Financing Guidelines by China Banking \nRegulatory Commission (CBRC) and National Development and Reform Commission and will \ncontribute  to  deepening  financial  markets  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and \nmobilizing domestic savings to meet the investment requirements of green investments. The \nproposed project will deploy effective finance on green and low emission development through \n(i) debt financing with limited recourse to fixed asset collateral, (ii) guarantee support to low-\ncarbon development, energy saving, and environmental improvement projects for easier access \nto commercial bank financing, and (iii) mezzanine financing in the form of subordinate debt2 or \npreference share investments in promising small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), etc. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  is  required  to  establish  the \ninstitutional, legal, and financial arrangements for the proposed financing platform. The PPTA \nwill be implemented in two phases. The first phase will be conducted by a team of individual \nexperts to work on the project design and due diligence of the financial intermediation loan \n(FIL). This includes (i) due diligence and capacity assessment of the management team of the \nproposed  financing  platform,  (ii)  defining  roles  and  responsibilities  of  partner  financial \ninstitutions, (iii) structuring incentive frameworks for different stakeholders and partners (iv) \nestablishing financial managements and fiduciary control mechanisms, (v) preparing legal and \ncontractual arrangement between different financial partner institutions, and (vi) establishing the \nenvironment and social management system (ESMS).  In addition, the technical, financial, and \nenvironmental due diligence on the first batch of subprojects need to be undertaken and the \neligibility and selection criteria of subsequent batches of subprojects need to be prepared.   \n \n3.  The second phase will be implemented by another team of experts to prepare the \nsubsequent  projects  and  conduct  due  diligence  assessment  on  financial,  economic, \nenvironment, land acquisition and resettlement, social and gender development, governance, \nand procurement. The major outputs and activities of the first phase are summarized in Table \nA3.1.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n4.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB's)  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other \nsources). The Government has been advised that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB \nto finance the ensuing project. The detailed cost estimate is presented in Table A3.2.  \n                                                \n1  Greater BTH region refers to Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi and Liaoning \nprovinces; and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. \n2  In the event of cash flow constraints, subordinated debt ranks below commercial bank loans in both repayment and \nliquidation. Usually subordinated debt does not take security and levies a higher interest rate. The preference \nshares have a fixed dividend rate and buyback requirement after a certain time.    \n ", "2   \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected \n    Expected \nCommencement \nMajor Activities  Major Outputs  Completion Date \nDate \nPPTA Phase 1 \nProject Scope and Technical Design \n-  Gather relevant data and information   -  Sector assessment \n-  Market and technical assessment for green  report \nfinancing platform   -  Risk assessment \n-  September \n-  Assess sector and project risks  -  July 2016  report  \n2016 \n-  Update sector assessment  -  Technical due \n-  Technical  appraisal  of  identified  sample  diligence report for \nsubprojects   subprojects \nFinancial and Economic Analyses       \n-  Development of financing structure and \nimplementation arrangement  \n-  Financial management due diligence of the \nfinancing partners \n-  Conduct economic and financial analyses \n-  Economic and financial \nwith sensitivity analysis on sample \nanalysis report \nsubprojects \n-  Fund flow analysis \n-  Financial due diligence of subprojects  \nreport  -  September \n-  Assess procurement capacity of selected  -  July 2016 \n-  Financial management  2016 \nsubborowers  \nassessment report \n-  Assess corporate management structure of \n-  Procurement capacity \nselected subborowers   \nassessment report \n-  Prepare project financing plan including on-\nlending schemes \n-  Assess fund flow, disbursement mechanism \nand funding arrangements \n-  Risk bearing capacity of I&G \nSafeguard       \n-  Environmental and \n-  Assess  applicable laws,  regulations,  rules \nsocial management \nand procedures for managing and mitigating \nsystem \nthe environmental and social impact of the \n-  Summary poverty \ngreen financing platform \nreduction and social \n-  Prepare an ESMS \nstrategy   -  September \n-  Develop the grievance redress mechanism  -  July 2016 \n2016 \n-  Conduct poverty, social and gender analysis   -  Social safeguard due \n-  Conduct  social  safeguards  due  diligence  diligence report \nand screening of candidate subprojects    -  Subproject EIA/ \n-  Conduct  environmental  due  diligence  of \nIEE/ Environment due \nsample subprojects \ndiligence report \nCapacity Building       \n-  Give ADB\u2019s safeguards policy training \n-  Training manual and  -  December \n-  Organized ADB\u2019s disbursement and  -  July 2016 \ntraining reports  2016 \nprocurement training \nPPTA Phase 2 \nConduct  due  diligence  on  subsequent \nsubprojects  \n-  Financial  \n-  Economic  \n-  September \n-  Environment   -  Due diligence reports  -  August 2017 \n2016 \n-  Social safeguards  \n-  Social analysis   \n-  Governance  \n-  Procurement \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ESMS = environment and social management system, I&G = China National \nInvestment & Guaranty Corporation, PPTA = project preparatory technical assistance.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n ", "  3 \n \n \n \nTable A3.2: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \nTotal \n Item  Cost \nA.
