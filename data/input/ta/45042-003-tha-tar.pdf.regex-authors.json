INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Thailand has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nassist in developing and improving the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). A reconnaissance \nmission from ADB visited Bangkok from 12 to 16 March 2012. The mission\u2019s purpose was to \ndiscuss rail sector issues with government officials and agree on the objectives, scope, and other \naspects of the policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for the Accounting and Financial \nManagement System Reform of Thailand\u2019s Railway Sector Project. Agreement was reached on \nthese rail sector issues, details of which are provided in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1).1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132014 country operations business plan for \nThailand.2 \n \n2.  Thailand\u2019s  Eleventh  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132016 \nemphasizes expanding infrastructure and transport systems to improve connectivity between \nBangkok  and  the  provinces  and  with  neighboring  countries.3 In  line  with  the  plan,  the \ngovernment has embarked on a program to revitalize railways in Thailand and help the rail \nsubsector play a more substantive role in the country\u2019s transport system. The cabinet has \nlaunched a program to modernize the existing railway network, which is owned and operated by \nthe  SRT.  The  development  of  modern  and  efficient  railways  will  help  open  the  country\u2019s \ntransport  bottlenecks,  improve  the  integration  and  safety  of  the  transport  system,  reduce \nenvironmental pollution, and mitigate climate change. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Prolonged underinvestment and poor governance has kept Thailand\u2019s railway system from \nkeeping pace with market demand and economic growth. Operating and maintenance costs are \nhigher than for other railways in the region, and service is poor. Railway infrastructure is old, \nunreliable, and unsafe. The financial management system is outdated and operational accounts \npoorly reported. The percentage of long-distance passengers on rail fell from 78% in 1993 to 55% \nin  2009,  highlighting  a dramatic  reduction  in  competitiveness  compared  with  other  transport \nmodes. Freight transport has maintained its market share but only at 2% of total freight traffic. \n \n4.  Thailand  now  considers  railway  reform  to  be  important  for  retaining  its  economic \ncompetitiveness in the subregion and beyond. Railway reform is seen as supporting the broader \nobjectives of the 11th plan, which aims to increase the share of rail in freight transport from 2% to \n8% by 2020 and to support improved passenger mobility, especially for the poor or marginalized \nin society under public service obligations borne by the SRT. \n \n5.  The government\u2019s strong commitment to the rail sector is evident in its pledge to provide \nsignificant financial resources to improve railway operations, with investments amounting to B176 \nbillion approved by the Cabinet in 2010.4 In addition, Thailand wishes to reinvigorate its rail \nnetwork and services to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and road freight cut the sector\u2019s \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \n \n6.  The government recognizes that upgrading and expanding physical infrastructure alone is \nnot a complete solution. It understands that reforms to policy, institutions, financial accounting, \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 August 2012. \n2  ADB. 2011.

Bangkok. \n4  The SRT investment program, or Khem Khaeng scheme, was endorsed by the government on 27 April 2010. \n ", "2   \nand  governance,  as  well  as  capacity  development  and  operational  reform,  are  essential  to \nproviding passenger and freight services on a more commercial basis. This will ensure that \nrailway  infrastructure  and  equipment  are maintained  efficiently  and  effectively  and  that  SRT \nphysical assets and personnel are managed to yield maximum returns, benefits, and outputs. \n \n7.  A fundamental prerequisite of reform is to ensure a strong financial management and \ninformation system within the SRT. While much work has been undertaken in the past with \nrespect  to  reorganizing  the  SRT,  such  as  the  recently  introduced  business  lines  and  the \nseparation of some operations such as the Airport Rail Link, little attention has been given so far \nto  developing  financial  tools  to  account  for  financial  performance  within  the  organization.  A \nmodern and well functioning accounting and financial management system is required to allow the \nreform process to be effectively delivered, reported and monitored. As the government seeks \nmore and improved rail services, potentially to include private operations, improvements to the \nfinancial management system are required to allow cost and revenue sharing not just of existing \noperations but also for new systems and services. The TA will address this critical area and allow \nimproved monitoring and performance measurement to support the broader reforms over the \nmedium- and long-term development of the rail subsector in Thailand. The TA will strengthen SRT \ninstitutional  structure  and  operational  performance  by  developing  and  implementing  a \ncomprehensive financial management system to ensure that future investment and operational \ndecisions are based on robust financial information and that their performance can be monitored \nand reported to ensure ongoing performance improvements. \n \n8.  The TA is part of a series of ongoing and planned assistance projects provided by ADB to \nthe railway subsector in Thailand that is (i) preparing a restructuring plan and agenda reform,5 \n(ii) improving railway passenger services,6 and (iii) planning for the Greater Mekong Subregion \nRailway Association.7 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  This  impact  of  the  policy  and  advisory  TA  will  be  SRT  improving  its  financial \nmanagement and accepted audited accounts by 2015. The outcome of the TA will be an SRT \nmanagement,  accounting,  and  financial  information  system  developed  to  support  the \nrestructuring objectives of the government. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The policy and advisory TA has two main outputs: (i) specifying requirements for a new \nmanagement, accounting, and financial information system for the SRT; and (ii) preparing an \nimplementation plan for the transition of SRT\u2019s operations and finances to the new information \nsystem. \n \n11.  The key activity of the TA is to specify requirements for a new accounting and financial \nmanagement system that will underpin ongoing improvements to the structure and operations of \nthe SRT. The TA will (i) define the SRT\u2019s objectives as determined by its policy, legal, regulatory, \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2012.

The tasks underpinning the development of these outputs are described \nbelow. While the TA will identify the requirements of, and prepare the implementation plan for, \nthe reformed accounting and financial management system for the SRT, the system\u2019s purchase \nand physical implementation will be undertaken after the TA closes. \n \n12.  The SRT\u2019s objectives will be defined using a summary review of the policy, legal, and \nregulatory framework for Thailand\u2019s rail sector and its strategic and policy direction under the \ngovernment\u2019s  rail  support  program.  A  review  will  be  conducted  of  SRT\u2019s  operations  and \norganization structure, identifying primary sources of revenue, costs, finances, assets, and \nliabilities. These parameters will then be considered in the context of the SRT\u2019s current planning, \nbudgeting, accounting, financial management, and reporting framework. \n \n13.  Gaps  in  the  SRT\u2019s  current  accounting  and  financial  management  system  will  be \nassessed using the findings of consultations with key external and internal stakeholders in the \nSRT, such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transport, SRT management and staff, \ntrade unions, representatives of passengers and freight users, and the auditor general. These \ndiscussions will guide the identification of critical issues and information requirements to meet \nstakeholder concerns, and to ensure effective stakeholder consultation moving forward. This \nanalysis will include an assessment of the recent SRT restructuring into business units and the \nspecific requirements each may require under a new accounting and financial management \nsystem. \n \n14.  The bulk of the work in the TA will be analyzing the requirements of the SRT and its \nfinancial management and  specifying the requirements for a new accounting and financial \nmanagement system. A review of current work on accounting policies and on the assets and \nliabilities  of  the  SRT  will  provide  the  inputs  for  developing  actual  and  projected  financial \nstatements for the SRT. These statements will be used to guide and assess the progress of the \nbroader rail restructuring program currently underway in Thailand. This review will use a range \nof activities that includes evaluating the SRT\u2019s revenues, costs, and sources of finance, and \nassessing the requirements to allocate them to the recently introduced business units. The \nstudy will then define a methodology for preparing a market-based valuation of the SRT\u2019s assets \nand liabilities and assessing the requirements to allocate them to the business units. This \ninformation  will  provide  the  basis  for  defining  a  chart  of  accounts  and  methodologies  for \nallocating  costs  and  introducing  transfer  pricing  arrangements  that  will  support  the  future \nrestructuring needs of the SRT. This material will also be used to develop an access payment \nmechanism for the SRT and a method to calculate public sector obligations to support the \ngovernment\u2019s proposed regulatory framework in the future. The regulatory and management \nrequirements will be combined to provide the basis for developing an outline framework for \nderiving  key  performance  indicators  for  the  SRT.  This  activity  will  be  supported  by  an \nassessment of how technical data will be integrated with the new accounting and financial \nmanagement system and with planning and budgeting processes. The review will define the \noutline reporting requirements of the SRT\u2019s financial management system to meet stakeholder \n ", "4   \nrequirements, and the findings of the requirements analysis will be used to specify a financial \nmanagement and accounting system for the SRT. The TA will prepare full bid documentation \nand specification of implementation requirements, including financing options and a capacity \ndevelopment program for a new accounting system within the SRT. The implementation of the \naccounting and financial management will be undertaken after the TA closes, based on TA \nrecommendations. \n \n15.  The outputs of the financial management system will be used to develop a roadmap to \nsupport the transition of the SRT\u2019s financial management and operations, including suitable \nregulatory requirements for financial management mechanisms and a capacity development \nprogram  for  financial  management  and  accounting  system  implementation  related  to  SRT \nbusiness units. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,300,000, of which $950,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation  and \nequipment,  venues for workshops  and seminars,  and  other  in-kind  contributions. The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. Disbursements under the TA will accord with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The  TA  will  provide  advisory  services  to  the  government  and  the  SRT  toward  the \ndevelopment and implementation of accounting and financial management system reform for \nthe  railway  subsector.  The  project  executing  agency  will  be  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the \nimplementing agency will be the SRT. \n \n18.  The project will be implemented over 9 months from November 2012 to July 2013. \nConsultancy  services  will  be  provided  by  a  firm,  preferably  an  association  between  an \ninternational firm and a Thai accounting and auditing firm, in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will require 21 person-\nmonths of international consultancy and 37 person-months of national. Recruitment will use \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  and  a  standard  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  A  simplified \ntechnical proposal will be used for selecting the consultant firm. The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  The key report will specify the new management, accounting, and financial information \nsystem for the SRT, including bid documentation, a capacity development program, and an \nimplementation schedule. Additional reports will be prepared covering the two outputs: (i) a \nspecification of a new management, accounting, and financial information system for the SRT, \nand (ii) an implementation plan with detailed bidding documents for the transition of the SRT\u2019s \noperations and finances to the new information system, defining key activities, a timetable, \nexpected costs, and sources of finance. Workshops will be held at key milestones of the TA, \ncovering each of the outputs, and the final workshop will be for the government, development \npartners, and nongovernment organizations. Stakeholder meetings will be held throughout the \nTA. \n \n20.  Findings  from  the  TA  will  be  disseminated  through  ADB  reports  and  knowledge \nproducts. The work will be showcased at regional events such as Greater Mekong Subregion \n ", "  5 \nRail Coordination Office meetings and widely disseminated at international events and through \nthe ADB website. \n \n21.  The government will ensure the provision of (i) all relevant documents, data, and any \nother information that may be required by the TA consultants to meet the objectives of the TA, \nall readily available; (ii) appropriate and qualified counterpart staff and secretarial and clerical \nsupport; (iii) suitable office accommodation and equipment; and (iv) logistical assistance for the \nworkshops and seminars, including the venue, identifying and inviting participants, secretarial \nservices, and seminar coordination. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 to the Government \nof Thailand to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the \nAccounting  and  Financial  Management  System  Reform  of  Thailand's  Railway  Sector,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nThe SRT improving its  Accepted audited  Government  Investment in rail \nfinancial management   accounts by 2015  transport statistics  infrastructure and \n    rolling stock \nFinancial performance of    sufficient to support \nthe SRT improved from    improved \na budget deficit in 2010  SRT financial  operations and \nto operational  statements and  services \nprofitability by 2020  audited accounts   \nRisk \nLimited growth in \ntransport demand  \nOutcome      Assumption \nAn SRT management,  The SRT accepting  TA reports on KPIs  SRT agreement on \naccounting, and financial  financial management    new accounting \ninformation system  system program  Reports from SRT  system \ndeveloped to support the  requirements and  restructuring program  requirements \nfuture restructuring  agreeing to implement  management \nobjectives of the government  the schedule by the end \nof 2013 \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Scope and Outcomes  \n \n1.  The policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) will provide advisory services to the \nGovernment of Thailand and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) to strengthen its accounting \nand  financial  management  information  system.  The  TA\u2019s  primary  focus  is  to  develop  an \naccounting  and  financial  management  system  that  will  underpin  ongoing  improvements  to \nSRT\u2019s institutional structure and operations. It will (i) specify a new management, accounting, \nand financial information system for the SRT to meet its projected information requirements; and \n(ii) an implementation plan with detailed bidding documents to manage the transition of the \nSRT\u2019s  operations  and  finances  to  the  new  information  system,  defining  key  activities,  a \ntimetable, expected costs, and sources of finance. Specific tasks under these outputs will \ninclude (i) defining the SRT\u2019s objectives as determined by its policy, legal, regulatory, and \nplanning  framework,  and  by  the  proposed  restructuring  program;  (ii)  defining  the  SRT\u2019s \nmanagement,  accounting,  financial  information,  and  reporting  requirements  based  on \ndiscussions  with  key  stakeholders;  (iii)  defining  gaps  in  the  SRT\u2019s  reports  and  capacity \nrequirements that need to be met by a new accounting and financial management system, \nbased on a review of the SRT\u2019s current reporting system, existing information system, and \nactivities now being undertaken by consultants in this area; (iv) specifying a new management, \naccounting, and financial information system, with supporting bid documents and a capacity \ndevelopment  program;  and  (v)  planning  the  implementation  of  the  transition  of  the  SRT\u2019s \noperations and finances to the new information system, defining key activities, a timetable, \nexpected costs, and sources of finance. \n \n2.  The key deliverable of the TA is the design of an accounting and financial management \nsystem for the SRT. The design will be prepared, with full bid documentation, for a management \nand financial information system, a capacity development program, an implementation schedule, \nand the identification of financial resources to support implementation. Additional reports will be \nprepared covering each of the project outputs: (i) on the legal, regulatory, and policy governing \nthe  SRT  and  its  restructuring  program;  (ii)  on  stakeholder  involvement  and  information \nrequirements  for  the  SRT;  (iii)  evaluating  SRT  finances,  including  a  chart  of  accounts,  a \nmethodology to allocate costs to business units and derive transfer prices, a methodology for \nderiving  market-based  valuations  of  assets  and  their  assignment  to  business  units, \nmethodologies developed to estimate public service obligation (PSOs) and third party access \npayments, and a derived framework for preparing key performance indicators (KPIs) that is \nsupported  by  defined  planning,  budgeting,  and  reporting  requirements;  (iv)  specifying  the \nrequirements for a new management, accounting, and financial information system for the SRT \nto meet its projected information requirements, including bid documentation for an information \nsystem  and  capacity  development  and  implementation  program;  and  (v)  outlining  a \ncommunication plan for the TA. \n \n3.  The  project  is  expected  to  cost  $950,000  and  be  implemented  over  9  months. \nConsultancy  services  will  be  provided  by  a  firm,  preferably  an  association  between  an \ninternational firm and a Thai accounting and auditing firm. The TA will require 21 person-months \nof international consultancy and 37 person-months of national. Reports will be prepared in \nEnglish, and all translation will be undertaken within the TA budget of the consultants.  \n \nB.  Tasks \n \n4.
