INTRODUCTION \n1.  Economies in the Asia and Pacific region are becoming more deeply and strongly linked. \nTo enhance the economic potential of the region, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) established \nthe Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) in 2005 and adopted a regional cooperation \nand integration (RCI) strategy1 in July 2006 to facilitate and coordinate ADB\u2019s efforts and to raise \nADB\u2019s profile at key RCI events. OREI launched the Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) \nwebsite in October 2006 to provide information on the progress of RCI initiatives in the region \nunder the four pillars of the RCI strategy: (i) cross-border infrastructure and associated software, (ii) \ntrade and investment, (iii) money and finance, and (iv) regional public goods. Since its launch, the \nARIC website has become an authoritative source of RCI information. \n \n2.  As RCI continues to evolve, so does the work to promote and support it. Web statistics and \nuser surveys indicate that ARIC already provides a platform for consolidating and disseminating \ninformation on RCI. These successes need to be built upon. This technical assistance (TA) paper \ndescribes the purpose and output, methodology and key activities, cost estimates and financing \nplan, and implementation arrangements of the second phase of ARIC. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Integration in the Asia and Pacific region has been gaining momentum. Intraregional trade \nin East Asia (as a percentage of the region\u2019s total trade) alone rose from 43% in 1990 to 55% in \n2006. 3  The  pace  of  integration  has  been  largely  market-driven 4  and  has  recently  been \ncharacterized by national trade and investment liberalization and a proliferation of free trade \nagreements.  Asian  countries  have  also  intensified  cooperation  in  infrastructure  and  capacity \nbuilding, money and finance, and regional public goods. ADB has been at the forefront of efforts to \npromote  regional  cooperation  and  has  played  a  major  role  in  supporting  regional  economic \ninitiatives.  \n \n4.  As Asia moves toward greater integration, ADB\u2019s support for RCI is expected to increase in \nimportance. In addition to OREI, which facilitates and coordinates ADB\u2019s RCI support, the regional \ndepartments were realigned in 2006 to improve the coherence of ADB\u2019s regional operations, and \nto strengthen the synergy between country and regional operations. The five regional departments \nwere given responsibility for pillar 1 of the RCI strategy in close collaboration with ADB\u2019s Private \nSector Operations Department (PSOD) and Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO). OREI was \ngiven primary responsibility for pillars 2 and 3 while responsibility for pillar 4 given to ADB\u2019s \nRegional and Sustainable Department (RSDD), supported by ADB\u2019s Office of General Counsel \n(OGC). \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Manila (July). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 31 March 2008. \n3  Defined to comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; \nJapan; Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China; and based on data from Direction of Trade Statistics, International \nMonetary Fund. \n4  See, for example, Kawai, M. and G. Wignaraja. 2008. Regionalism as an Engine of Multilateralism: A Case for a \nSingle East Asian FTA. ADB WP Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 14. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  The ARIC website traces its roots from a website called the Asia Recovery Information \nCenter,5 set up in 1999 to provide accurate, timely, and comprehensive information on economies \naffected by the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis. As the recovery took off, the scope of the website \nexpanded. The number of visitors to the ARIC website has steadily increased and in 2007 the \naverage number of daily visitors reached about 850, an increase of about 9% from the fourth \nquarter of 2006 (780 average daily visitors). During major events, the number of ARIC visitors \npeaked at about 1,400 per day. \n \n6.  Since its launch, the ARIC website has served as a clearinghouse for RCI information from \nADB and other sources on the 48 regional member countries of ADB. Information on 45 regional \ninitiatives and/or programs is organized according to the four key pillars of the RCI strategy. \nHeadline news, opinion and editorials, research, and related links are updated daily. The ARIC \nwebsite has also served as the main dissemination platform for papers on RCI and reports on \nmacroeconomic developments in the region.   \n \n7.  ARIC also houses databases. The RCI indicators database is a statistical tool that features \na  set  of  integration  indicators  to  monitor  progress  in  RCI.  The  free  trade  agreement  (FTA) \ndatabase tracks almost 200 FTAs in Asia and the Pacific. An FTA comparative toolkit allows users \nto compare sections of different FTA agreement texts easily.   \n \n8.  The existing ARIC website highlights original research by OREI, including the working \npaper series on regional economic integration, which provides in-depth analysis of major issues \nrelating to RCI. To date, 14 working papers have been produced and a lot of research is in the \npipeline. Some working papers have been cited by international media. The website also covers \nthe  seminar  series  on  regional  economic  integration  organized  by  OREI,  which  has  brought \ntogether 10 speakers to discuss issues covering the four RCI pillars.      \n \n9.  The Asian macroeconomic development section continues the approach of the original \nAsia  Recovery  Information  Center.  It  has  a  dedicated  readership  from  users  monitoring \nmacroeconomic developments in the region. A key component is the Asia Economic Monitor (AEM) \nwhich provides a semiannual review and outlook on growth of the section and development in \nemerging  Asia.  15  issues  of  the  AEM  have  been  published  and  widely  disseminated  in \ninternational media. This section also includes an economic and financial indicators database, \nproviding users with statistical data on the real, external, monetary, and financial sectors of 15 \neconomies from East Asia and 4 economies from South Asia6.  \n \n10.  Other  institutions  have  used  the  ARIC  website  as  a  benchmark  in  developing  their \nwebsites. ARIC has been consulted by the Secretariat for the Common Market for Eastern and \nSouthern Africa, which plans to establish a regional integration surveillance mechanism. The ARIC \nwebsite was also included in the United Nations University, Center for Comparative Regional \nIntegration Studies in its best-practice analysis of online resources dealing with integration studies. \nAs an example of its growing influence, ARIC assisted the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nSecretariat (ASEC) to create a website for its statistical unit and is helping ASEC to develop an \n                                                 \n5  Previous TA projects which supported maintenance of the ARIC website include: ADB. 1999.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The objective of the TA is to strengthen the dissemination of information and knowledge on \nRCI in the Asia and Pacific region. This will involve maintaining the ARIC website, regularly \nupdating its content, increasing its country coverage in some sections of the site and undertaking \nmore content and web interface enhancements. As the number of knowledge resources on RCI \ngrows, more working and occasional papers will be published, including economic monitoring \nreports, and more seminars and workshops on regional economic integration will be held.  \n \n12.  The TA will increase awareness of Asian regional cooperation and integration initiatives \namong various stakeholders, such as government officials both at the policy-making and technical \nlevels, academic researchers, officials and staff of international institutions, private sector users, \nand journalists, as well as ADB Management and staff. The use of reliable and comprehensive \ninformation by key stakeholders and ADB staff will result in better regional cooperation policies \nand more appropriate and well-designed regional projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  TA  will  undertake  several  interrelated  tasks,  all  directed  at  strengthening  the \ndissemination of information and knowledge on RCI in the Asia and Pacific region and raising \nawareness. These include (i) maintaining and enhancing the ARIC website, (ii) supporting the \nADB  seminar  series  on  regional  economic  integration,  (iii)  supporting  the  ADB  working  and \noccasional paper series on regional economic integration, and (iv) supporting the preparation of \nAEM and other OREI research activities. The TA will cover all ADB DMCs. Assistance will not be \nundertaken in any DMCs until ADB receives a notice of no objection from the government. \n \n14.  Enhancements will be made to the web interface and content of the ARIC website. More \ncontent summaries will be made available at the home page to provide users with a quick guide to \nthe  website.  Software  and  hardware  will  be  purchased  to  enable  more  interactive  website \npresentations.  \n \n15.  The list of initiatives featured under the four RCI pillars will be reviewed and expanded. The \nscope of the regional public goods pillar will be expanded to include emerging issues such as \nclimate change and this will require more collaboration among RSDD, OGC, and OREI.  Links with \nknowledge products of subregional initiatives (e.g., the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-\nPhilippines East ASEAN Growth Area trade and investment database) will be strengthened.  \n \n16.  The RCI indicators database will be expanded to include more economies, subregional \ngroupings (especially those supported by ADB), sectoral data, and other statistical measures of \nregional integration for the four RCI pillars. When choosing RCI indicators, attention will be paid to \nensuring that these are consistent with those in the statistics section of ADB\u2019s main website. \nSTthaet ivsiteicwasl  esxopruerscseesd  hweirlle inb ea rep tuhrocshea osfe tdh e tcoo nsstureltanngtt haendn  dtoh eno tR nCecI esinsdaircilay troerpsr esdeantat bthaossee.  ofT AhDeB  \u2019FsT  A \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \ncomparative toolkit will be improved to include annexes of agreement texts. The economic and \nfinancial  indicators  database  will  be  enhanced  so  that  statistical  data  for  the  19  economies \npresently covered can be presented in a more visual and interactive way.  \n \n ", "4   \n17.  Links of the ARIC website to the main ADB main website will be strengthened by promoting \nsharing and linking of resources. OREI will also take an active role in developing and improving \nthe regional cooperation web page in the ADB main website. More collaborative undertakings will \nbe explored with other institutions. Links to international best practices on RCI outside the region \nwill also be developed.    \n \n18.  The TA will explore the possibility of incorporating new features such as newsletter-type \nonline publications and discussion forums. Customized knowledge products will be developed to \ntarget specific users of the ARIC website. A daily update of the website will ensure that the latest \nADB-wide and external information on RCI is uploaded. OREI will use advice and information from \nthe network of contact points for the website in various ADB departments to improve website \ncontent. Efforts will be made to expand this network within and outside ADB. \n \n19.  Five to seven seminars will be held during the TA implementation period. Four to six \nworking  papers  and  three  or  four  occasional  papers  will  be  produced  and  disseminated  in \ncollaboration  with  the  ADB  Department  of  External  Relations  (DER).  ADB  staff  and  key \nstakeholders will be invited to contribute to the seminars and paper series. \n \n20.  Three  issues  of  the  AEM  will  be  produced  for  online  publication  during  the  TA \nimplementation  period.  These  will  cover  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN) \ncountries;  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China;  Hong  Kong,  China;  Republic  of  Korea;  and \nTaipei,China as previously, and possibly also South and Central Asian countries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The total cost of the TA, estimated at $900,000, will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost will cover remuneration, honoraria, travel, and per diem for \ninternational and national consultants and resource persons, database subscriptions, computer \nhardware and software, publications, communications and supplies, seminar and meeting costs, \nand other costs. The detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. OREI will implement the TA, in close \ncollaboration with other ADB departments and offices. The community of practice on regional \ncooperation and integration will provide advice and guidance as required. \n \n23.  The TA will require about 32 person-months of international and 147 person-months of \nnational consulting services. All the consultants will be hired as individual consultants according to \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  Terms of \nreference for the consultants are outlined in Appendix 3.  \n \n24.  One international consultant\u2014an economist with expertise in trade, macroeconomic, and \ndevelopment issues in Asia\u2014will be made the team leader. Under the supervision of ADB staff, \nthis consultant will oversee other consultants who will develop and maintain the ARIC website as \nwell as other ARIC activities. Other international consultants\u2014economists familiar with trade, \nmacroeconomic, and development issues in Asia, particularly the ADB DMCs, and with strong \nanalytical  and  communication  skills\u2014will  help  prepare  special  studies  on  topical  issues  with \nsignificant policy implications for regional cooperation and integration.  An economics and copy \neditor will also draft contents of the ARIC website, and edit AEM reports and OREI working papers. \n \n ", "  5\n25.
