INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has ambitious \neconomic  growth  and  social  targets  in  its  forthcoming  Seventh  Five-Year  National  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (NSEDP7), 2011\u20132015. However, the statistical system to monitor \nprogress and evaluate results is very weak. Monitoring of progress toward the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by 2015 is also hampered by the questionable quality of data, given the \nstate of the statistical system. Against this background, the government requested capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assist with \nhuman resources capacity strengthening to implement the Strategy for the Development of the \nNational Statistical System, 2010\u22122020. The Lao Resident Mission fielded a fact-finding mission, \nwhich  reached  agreement  with  the  government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the \nproposed TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Recent developments. In line with ADB\u2019s new approach to Statistical Capacity Building2 \nin developing member countries with very weak statistical capacity, ADB provided technical \nsupport for a diagnostic study of the Lao PDR statistical system in 2008.3 This was followed by \ntwo  major  developments  in  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  national  statistical  system:  (i)  the  government \nprepared and adopted the Strategy for the Development of the National Statistical System in \nMay  2010,  and  (ii) the  National  Assembly  passed  the  Statistics  Law  in  June  2010.  The \nstrategies provide a long-term framework for development of official statistics needed to support \nthe policy and planning process, and for monitoring socioeconomic development. This brings \nthe Lao PDR among the nations that have a long-term national strategy, as agreed in the \nMarrakech Action Plan for Statistics in 2004.4 The passing of the Statistics Law provides the \nlegal foundation for statistical activities across the national statistical system in a harmonized \nmanner, with the Department of Statistics (DOS) playing the central coordinating role. These \npolicy actions reflect the government\u2019s increasing commitment to and support for the national \nstatistical system.  \n \n3.  Statistical system and the new statistics law. The statistical system of the Lao PDR is \nhighly decentralized\u2014horizontally across different ministries and vertically across provinces, \ndistricts, and villages, creating management challenges. The DOS undertakes major statistical \noperations such as the population census, and household and establishment surveys; and \nproduces national accounts statistics, price statistics, and other statistics needed for Millennium \nDevelopment Goal monitoring. The line ministries collect data in their own areas of operation. \nThe Statistics Law identifies the roles and responsibilities of different agencies and makes the \nDOS responsible for central management and coordination. The DOS is also the focal point for \nproviding technical guidance to all parties on data collection and the establishment of uniform \nstandards. Under the Strategy for the Development of the National Statistical System, the DOS \nwill have statistics divisions, units, and teams at provincial and district levels; and will have staff \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 November 2010. \n2  ADB. 2006. Statistical Capacity Building in the Asia and Pacific Region. Manila (January). \n3  ADB. 2008. National Statistical System of Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Report of Diagnostics and Long-Term \nAgenda for Building Capacity in Statistics. Manila (August). \n4  The action plan was agreed at the Second International Roundtable on Managing for Development Results held in \nMarrakech in 2004. This was in response to the identification and prioritization of better statistics in the results \nagenda at the International Roundtable on Better Measuring, Monitoring, and Managing for Development Results \nheld in Washington, DC in 2002. Statistics remain an important part of the results agenda.  \n ", "2 \n \nat  village  level.  At  the  same  time,  statistics work  in  ministries  and  other  central  agencies \n(provinces and sectors) will be strengthened. In 2005, about 350 staff were working in statistics, \n200 of whom were in district offices. The strategies aim to increase staff strength to 1,400 by \n2020 (this includes statistics staff in various divisions and units at provincial level and in the \nministries).  \n  \n4.  Challenges of developing staff capacity and skills. The strategy has seven goals and \n12 main work programs (summarized in Supplementary Appendix A).5 One of the seven goals is \nto build and enhance the knowledge of staff and statisticians in the national statistical system. \nThe corresponding work program to achieve this is to upgrade the knowledge, competencies, \nand  skills  of  statisticians  to  enable  them  to  become  experts  with  experience  and  skills \ncomparable to international standards. This work program requires the establishment of training \nteams to implement training-related work plans at every level\u2014providing training in statistical \ntechniques and methodologies; formulating human resource development plans; training in \norganizational management for managers; and training in different aspects of data processing \nand upgrading of educational qualifications of staff by increasing the number of diploma holders, \ngraduates, and postgraduates over the next 10 years.  \n \n5.  Educating, guiding, and upgrading the knowledge and skills of staff working in the area \nof official statistics is one of the responsibilities of the DOS. However, its capacity to carry out \nthese tasks is weak and training facilities at the DOS are very limited. Training opportunities \noffered by the DOS should include introductory courses on the Lao PDR statistical system; a set \nof courses to build basic understanding of statistical methods; basic courses on data collection, \ncompilation,  and  presentation;  and  other  basic  and  intermediate  subject  matter  courses. \nSpecialized training needs in official statistics\u2014such as national accounts, design of household \nand establishment based sample surveys, and other technical areas of training and education \nfor raising qualifications in statistics to diploma and degree level\u2014will have to be undertaken \noverseas in the short to medium term until capacity and opportunities become available in-\ncountry. Development of in-house training capacity is therefore necessary. Training curricula \nshould be drafted with the help of outside consultants and the DOS should use this to impart \ntraining to its own staff as well as staff of central ministries, provinces, and districts. Equally, \nstatistics  teaching  and  research  programs  should  begin  to  be  established  at  Lao  PDR \nuniversities.  \n \n6.  External assistance for support of statistics. The Swedish International Development \nCooperation Agency (Sida) supported the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey I\u2013IV, the \n1995 and 2005 population censuses, the 1998 Agriculture Census, the 2006 Economic Census, \nand others. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) supported the Multiple Indicator \nCluster Surveys in 1996, 2000, and 2006. The World Bank is supporting the DOS in the \npreparation of a sectoral master plan, the strengthening of the national accounts, undertaking \npoverty analysis using the results of the 2007\u20132008 Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey, \nand provision of basic training at provincial and district levels. Other donors have provided \nfinancial support for the DOS to carry out smaller surveys. Lessons from previous donor support \nare that (i) the legal framework to ensure sustainable capacity development was not in place, \nand (ii) donor support was primarily focused on obtaining survey results. With the end of Sida\u2019s \nassistance in June 2009,6 the government has requested support from donors, including the \nWorld Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the European Commission, \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations member countries, and various specialized United \n                                                 \n5   Available upon request. \n6  Sida has been gradually exiting from the Lao PDR, and the Embassy of Sweden was closed in 2010.  \n  ", "3 \n \nNations  agencies.  UNDP  has  agreed  to  coordinate  donor  support,  aiming  for  a  more \nharmonized approach, starting in 2011. \n \n7.  Given the major challenges ahead for the new organization, the low level of managerial \nand technical skills, and the difficulty of attracting qualified staff, a long-term phased approach is \nrequired for building the statistical capacity. The DOS has requested ADB to provide support for \n(i) ensuring a greater awareness of statistical units of their functions under the new Statistics \nLaw, (ii) developing the in-house training capacity of the DOS to support the training needs of \nthe statistical system envisaged under the Statistics Law and the Strategy for the Development \nof  the  National  Statistical  System,  and  (iii) strengthening  capacity  in  data  processing  and \nanalysis of survey data through hands-on-training in data analysis. ADB will initiate and provide \nthis support for developing capacity, while the UNDP-led coordination mechanism among the \ndevelopment partners in the Lao PDR is being developed. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA impact is an improved monitoring and evaluation of the implementation progress \nof the NSEDP7 in selected sectors through the collection and compilation of timely, reliable, and \nquality statistics. \n \n9.  The  outcome  is  improved  capacity  of  staff  of  the  DOS  and  statistics  units  in  key \nministries  and  provinces,  as  measured  by  the  adoption  of  sound  statistical  standards  and \nmethodologies, and implementation of statistical coordination mechanisms. The outputs are \n(i) statistics units have greater awareness of their functions under the new Statistics Law, (ii) a \nstatistics training program is implemented, and (iii) capability to process selected surveys is \nstrengthened.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The key activities by output are discussed below. \n \n11.  Output 1: Statistics units have greater awareness of their functions under the new \nStatistics Law. The Statistics Law defines the organizational structure of the national statistical \nsystem; and the roles and responsibilities, mandates, and authority of the different components \nof the system at various levels. The law thus provides the basis for conduct of statistical \nactivities  across  the  national  statistical  system  in  a  harmonized  manner.  The  DOS  will \ndisseminate the Statistics Law and its implementing decrees among key stakeholders in central \nministries and in the provinces. This will enable the DOS to promote and improve awareness \nand understanding of the provisions of the Statistics Law and strengthen coordination among \ndata producers. There will be three workshops in central ministries and four workshops in \nprovinces, which will target 150\u2013200 participants. Legal documents will also be published for \ndistribution to public.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Statistics training program is implemented. The objective is to improve the \nskills of statistics personnel at the DOS and relevant ministries (ministries of education, health, \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \npublic works and transport, industry, and commerce); and provinces and districts (Vientiane \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nCapital,  Savannakhet,  Champasack,  and  Luangprabang).  This  will  include  (i) developing  a \ntraining program relevant to the skills needed to implement the Strategy for the Development of \nthe  National  Statistical  Systems  and  the  Statistics  Law;  (ii) developing  in-country  training \n ", "4 \n \ncapacity through (a) developing training courses and training materials, and (b) training 10 \ntrainers and establishing training teams to implement training-related work plans from central to \nlocal levels; and (iii) providing training on statistical techniques and methodologies in different \naspects  of  data  collection,  specifically  on  sampling  design  for  conduct  of  household  and \nestablishment-based surveys, estimation techniques, data analysis and survey management, \nand  other  technical  areas  of  official  statistics;  report  writing,  data  presentation,  and \ndissemination. \n \n13.  Output 3: Capability to process selected surveys is strengthened. To meet the data \ngaps in the compilation of national accounts and poverty estimation and analysis, this will \nprovide support to the annual household and establishment surveys. Activities under this output \ninclude  the  development  of  the  design  of  survey  processing  and  hands-on  training  and \nmentoring of statistics staff as well as test staff knowledge gained from survey-related training \nunder output 2. This will reduce DOS dependency on external consultants in conducting the \nanalysis and reporting of survey results. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $800,000  of  which  ADB  will  finance  $690,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV and \nTASF-other  sources).  The  government  will  finance  the  balance  amounting  to  $110,000 \nequivalent, in-kind, to cover the cost of counterpart personnel, office space, resource center \nspace, equipment and facilities for counterpart staff, administrative and logistic support, and \nother related services. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The DOS, under the Ministry of Planning and Investment, will be the executing agency. \nA steering committee, including members from relevant line ministries (including for agriculture, \nhealth, education, industry and commerce, and public works and transport) will be established \nunder  the  chair  of  the  director  general  of  the  DOS  to  provide  guidance  and  oversee \nimplementation of the TA. The project will be implemented in close coordination with various \ndepartments of line ministries and provincial offices, and key donors. The DOS will provide \noffice space, furniture, and support services for the consultants; and the TA will provide office \ncomputers and supplies.  \n \n16.  Three international experts in the areas of  institutional and human resources strategy \ndevelopment, statistics training and survey data processing (a total of 17 person-months) and \none national statistics expert (18 person-months) will be recruited through a consulting firm \nthrough quality- and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Equipment procured under this TA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The assets will be handed over to the DOS upon \ncompletion of the project. A vehicle will be leased for the use of the consultants.  \n  \n17.  Dissemination workshops and seminars will be held in Vientiane and provincial capitals. \nEight persons will receive overseas\u2019 training in the region, possibly Viet Nam or India. Other \nworkshops will be held in Vientiane and provincial capitals. The TA will be implemented over \n30 months from January 2011 to June 2013, following the signing of the TA agreement between \n  ", "5 \n \nthe government and ADB. Consultant deliverables are included in the terms of reference in \nAppendix 3. The TA will be managed by the Lao Resident Mission.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $690,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Capacity Strengthening of the \nNational Statistical System, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "", "Appendix 1  6 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n       \n    Data Sources and   \n  Performance Targets and  Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nMonitoring and evaluation  By 2016, indicators and  MPI NSEDP7 midterm  Sustained government \nof the implementation  targets of the NSEDP7 are  review and final  ownership and commitment  \nprogress of the NSEDP7,  based on better quality  reports   \n2010\u20132015, in selected  performance data.
