The  provincial  Government  of  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa,  Pakistan,  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  improve  Peshawar\u2019s  urban  transport  system  (UTS)  and \nprovide technical and financial support to implement a bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor and \nstrengthen institutions managing the UTS. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) \nwill build on (i) Peshawar Urban Transport Pre-Feasibility Study recently undertaken by Cities \nDevelopment Initiative for Asia (CDIA), and (ii) advance preparation activities undertaken under \na government-financed TA. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The PPTA will have the following outputs: (i) implement recommendations made under \nCDIA\u2019s assistance, regarding the urban transport policy reform framework and institutional and \norganizational  developments,  such  as  establishing  a  Transport  Authority  (Peshawar  Urban \nMobility Authority - PUMA) to regulate, plan, and coordinate Peshawar\u2019s UTS; and a Company \n(Peshawar  BRT  Company  -  PBRTC)  to  implement  and  later  manage  BRT  operations;  (ii) \nproduce conceptual plans for BRT and non-motorized transport (NMT) networks; (iii) undertake \npreliminary design and cost estimates of BRT and corridor 2 restructuration, including drawings \nat sufficient level of details to be taken up for detailed design;1 (iv) assess the opportunity to \nintegrate intercity bus depots and off-street parking components in the project scope, and \nundertake preliminary design of such components; (v) conduct full due diligence for the BRT \ncorridor  and  associated  infrastructures;2 (vi)  undertake  a  public-private  partnership  (PPP) \nassessment to identify viable PPP options, leading to transaction advisory services to assist the \ngovernment in the delivery of selected PPP scheme(s), if any; (vii) produce a BRT operations \nfinancial model and initiate an industry transition process through negotiation with existing bus \noperators; (viii) draft a project implementation roadmap including the project financing plan, an \nindicative implementation schedule and a procurement strategy and plan; (ix) develop a parking \nstrategy, a street vendors\u2019 policy and other traffic management rules along the corridor; and (x) \ndevelop a transit-oriented urban development strategy along the corridor.

The soon-to-be \nestablished PUMA and PBRTC will be evaluated in terms of staffing capacity, organizational and administrative \nsetup, evidence of transparency and accountability, and filing systems. If risks are identified, PPTA will propose an \naction plan to minimize those risks, mainly through capacity building. A security risk assessment will also be \nconducted to take into account Peshawar\u2019s specific context. A climate change vulnerability assessment and a \nstudy on carbon emissions for the selected BRT line and potential for clean development mechanism will be \nundertaken as well.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n4.
