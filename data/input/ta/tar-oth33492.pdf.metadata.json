INTRODUCTION\n1.  With  increasing  participation  of  the  private  sector  and  communities1  in  urban\ninfrastructure and services throughout the Asian and Pacific Region over the last decade, the\nvarious approaches and strategies being implemented in a range of cities should be evaluated.\nAn examination of private sector participation (PSP) experiences to identify successes and\nfailures could help disseminate information about the successful practices in water supply,\nsanitation, and solid waste management. In light of the new poverty reduction strategy of the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB), it is useful to assess whether these PSP approaches have\nsucceeded in providing affordable services to poor urban households. This regional technical\nassistance (TA) will document and assess the best PSP practices in urban services and identify\napproaches  for  future  public-private-community  partnership  activities  to  reach  poor  urban\ncommunities.2 A TA framework is attached as Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  Close to one billion of the world\u2019s poor live in the Region, with nearly one in three Asians\nclassified as poor. Because of continuing rural-urban migration, urban poverty3 is widespread\nand  rising,  with  millions  of  poor  families  residing  in  \u201cinformal\u201d  or  \u201csquatter\u201d  settlements.\nInvestment in basic urban infrastructure and services is crucial to improving the quality of life for\nthese people. Access to stable and safe water supply, for example, can reduce the incidence of\ndisease and increase time available for productive activities.\n3.  Both  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  private  sector  development  strategy\nrecognize that the private sector can contribute to poverty reduction in the urban sector through\nexpansion of urban services and improvement of corporate governance and responsibility. The\nstrategies support exploring innovative approaches to enable private sector operators as well as\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) to increase\ntheir participation in providing urban services and in projects targeting the poor. Approaches\nsuch as public-private partnership, privatization, contracting out, and community initiatives are\nsome of the options to attract private sector investments.\n4.  ADB has provided TA to a number of developing member countries (DMCs) to promote\nPSP in urban services.4 The TAs have been country-specific, except TA 5753: Developing Best\nPractices for Promoting Private Sector Investment in Infrastructure,  which  was  aimed  at\ndeveloping best practices to promote PSP in infrastructure covering power, water supply, roads,\nports, and airports. The impact of PSP on the poor was not considered in any of the previous\nTAs.\n5.  PSP in urban services in DMCs has grown rapidly over the last 10 years. With rapid\nurbanization and population growth, municipalities are faced with an increasing shortage of\n                                                \n1 In the following text, the term \u201cprivate sector\u201d refers to all nongovernment entities, i.e., including commercial\ncompanies as well as civil society organized in nongovernment organizations (NGOs) or community-based\norganizations (CBOs).\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in October 1999.\n3 Urban poverty is defined as poor quality of life combining low income, poor health and education, deprivation in\nknowledge and communications, and the inability to exercise human and political rights.

In many DMCs, governments have therefore turned\nto the private sector and/or communities to finance, build, own, or manage urban services.\nIntroducing private sector expertise can reap a variety of benefits, such as improved services,\nincreased operational efficiency and, in the long term, reduced tariffs. In addition, private sector\ninvolvement can free scarce public financial resources that can then be allocated to sectors\nwhere private sector interest is limited.\n6.  PSP in urban services can occur in a variety of forms, ranging from large-scale contracts\n(such  as  divestiture,  build-operate-transfer  schemes,  concessions,  and  leasing  and\nmanagement contracts) to smaller-scale options (such as contracting out; suppliers; and NGO,\ncommunity, and mini contractors). Large-scale, long-term, monopoly contracts are dominating\nthe  trend  to  engage  the  private  sector  in  urban  services  in  many  developing  countries.5\nHowever, more flexibility toward involving communities will be needed to increase and improve\nservices to poor households in these countries. Regulations setting uniform service, high quality\nstandards, and tariffs that are not affordable for the poor can result in these households being\nexcluded from the services. For example, while concession contracts often include coverage\ntargets to be achieved over the life of the concession, little regard is given to ensuring that the\npoor benefit equally from the increased coverage. Likewise, service standards based on the\nexperience in developed countries, such as mandatory in-house water pipelines, may prevent\ncompanies from serving poor neighborhoods as the up-front costs are perceived as too high.\nOther constraints, such as lack of secure land tenure, add to the problem of excluding poor\nhouseholds from services.\n7.  The constraints suggest that if PSP in urban services is to reach poor households,\nincentives and contract models to achieve this should be examined. Interest in smaller scale\ncontracts with nonconventional supplies has been growing in a number of countries in different\nregions, such as Southeast Asia and Latin America. Governments are realizing, however, that\nthese new approaches require changes in contractual arrangements and regulations to ensure\nthat poor people are served and that the means to sustain provision and access to urban\nmunicipal services for the long term are protected. To achieve this, policy makers have to pay\nmore attention to identifying how poor consumers obtain municipal services, the scope and\nnature of nontraditional supply, the willingness and ability of the poor consumers to pay for\nimproved access to and quality of services, and institutional barriers to improved services (e.g.,\nland tenure).\n8.  Successful experiences of governments, NGOs, civil societies, and private companies in\nmany DMCs show that poor people can afford and are willing to pay for reliable urban services.\nWhile subsidies in urban services often end up benefiting higher income groups and bypassing\npoorer ones, limited and well-targeted cross-subsidies play an important role in ensuring that\nthe urban poor will enjoy the benefits. Private sector and civil society organizations are often\nmuch more effective in delivering urban services than governments, which should focus their\nresources on facilitating and regulating these services rather than providing them.\n9.  In many DMCs, governments, the private sector, and NGOs and CBOs are already\nsuccessfully  exploring  innovative  approaches  to  provide  basic  urban  services  to  poor\nhouseholds, leading to higher coverage and quality of services provided. For example, CBOs in\nmany communities in Indonesia are directly involved in basic urban services, such as solid\n                                                \n5 Examples include the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) concessions in Manila, Bangkok\nMetropolitan Authority (BMA) for solid waste management, and the water supply build-operate-transfer (BOT) in\nChengdu, China.", "3\nwaste management and maintenance of roads. Several international agencies have also been\ninvolved in these efforts in the Region. The World Bank, under the Private Sector Infrastructure\nInitiative,  is  actively  promoting  policy  and  regulatory  reforms  in  PSP  for  the  provision  of\ninfrastructure and services that will benefit poor households. The Department for International\nDevelopment (DFID), United Kingdom, has undertaken studies to expand its program to support\nPSP in water and sanitation focusing on lower income groups and small urban areas. The\nWater and Sanitation Program (WSP), a partnership involving a number of bilateral agencies,\nthe  World  Bank,  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  documents\nsuccessful small private initiatives focusing on improving water supply and sanitation services to\nthe  poor.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  has  provided\nfunding assistance on the legal and regulatory framework for PSP in the urban environment\nsector in the Region. However, little attention has so far been given as to how traditional large-\nscale privatization can be designed to maximize benefits for the poor, and how small-scale\ncommunity efforts can become an integral part of the privatization of urban services for all\ncitizens.\n10.  The experience of private sector and community involvement in urban services has\ngiven rise to several important questions: Should countries take a sequencing approach to\nprivate sector involvement in urban services? What are the strengths and limitations of the\ncontract modalities (from large scale to small scale)? Which modalities have worked best in\nimproving  urban  services  to  poor  households?  Are  they  replicable?  Will  megacities  and\nsecondary towns have to apply different approaches? These are some of the main questions\nthis TA will address.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n11.  The TA will document and assess PSP experience in the provision of urban services to\npoor communities in selected DMC cities, and establish the most successful practices and\ninnovative approaches. This will provide a basis to assist DMC governments in strengthening (i)\nincentives to attract PSP, make PSP financially sustainable, and improve PSP in urban services\nthat reach the poor; (ii) institutional, contractual, and regulatory6 arrangements; and (iii) sector\npolicy issues related to pricing and competition. The longer term objective is to improve urban\nservices to poor households at affordable rates, to improve their quality of life.\nB.  Scope\n12.  The TA will study the experiences of selected DMC cities and cities outside the selected\nDMCs, discuss lessons learned, and identify innovative approaches to promote greater PSP in\nthe provision and management of water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management to\nreach poor urban communities.7 Large-scale and small-scale PSP will be examined to identify\nsuccesses and failures of these options in providing of urban services, in particular to poor\nhouseholds. The case studies will be assessed in terms of financial viability and profitability;\nimprovement of the quality of services provided; and of outreach improvement, in particular\naccessibility  of  poor  households  to  the  services.  The  cities  will  be  selected  based  on  (i)\npopulation size and rates of urban growth, (ii) geographical coverage, (iii) experience with\n                                                \n6 The TA will focus on improving the delivery of urban services by the private sector and communities to the poor.\nThe TA 5922-REG: Regulatory Systems and Networking of Water Utilities and Regulatory Bodies, for $500,000,\napproved on 19 July 2000 will focus on the regulatory arrangement of water utilities to improve their autonomy\nand financial viability and its results will be incorporated in this TA.\n7 The three subsectors covered in the TA form the first phase of a larger agenda including shelter, urban transport,\nand public markets, which will be addressed over a longer period.", "4\npublic-private community cooperation in urban services, and (iv) willingness to participate. The\nTA will be organized in three parts.\n13.  Part A: Inception Workshop, Theme Paper and City Reports. Part A will consist of (i)\nan inception workshop in Manila; (ii) a theme paper analyzing various types (both large- and\nsmall-scale) of PSP in urban services and how they affect poor neighborhoods, and assessing\nthe successful experiences of 2-3 cities outside the selected DMCs;8 (iii) reports from selected\nDMC cities9 reviewing and analyzing their experience with PSP in urban services and how these\nhave benefited the poor; and (iv) a consolidated background report comprising the theme paper\nand the city reports. The 2-day inception workshop in Manila is designed for representatives of\nthe participating cities to familiarize them with the objectives and scope of the TA and to\nexchange experiences and ideas. The theme paper will focus on institutional and contractual\narrangements that attempt to include poor neighborhoods in the service coverage and draw\nconclusions on what may be replicable in other cities. The reports from cities will identify and\nsurvey key stakeholders, such as national, regional, and local authorities, investors, private\nutility  companies,  small-scale  suppliers,  and  NGO  and  CBO  contractors,  to  provide  a\ncomprehensive assessment of the nature and quality of private sector involvement in municipal\nservice provision in the respective city.10 A consolidated background report will be prepared\ncomprising the theme paper, city reports, and the most successful practices and innovative\napproaches to improve PSP in urban services that reach the poor. The results can be used to\nguide ADB\u2019s future project design.\n14.  Part B: Regional Forum and Development of Guidelines. A three-day regional forum\nwill be convened in Manila, attended by national and local government representatives of about\n20  DMCs,  private  companies  (including  investors),  civil  society  organizations,  developed\ncountries, and international organizations to disseminate the findings of part A and explore\ninnovative approaches among a larger group of stakeholders. Based on these discussions, the\nmost successful practices and innovative approaches to improve pro-poor PSP will be further\nrefined.\n15.  Part C: Report, On-line Database, and Subregional Dissemination Workshops. Part\nC will comprise (i) the preparation of a comprehensive report, consolidating the findings of the\ntheme paper and city reports, workshop, and forum; (ii) the development of an on-line database\nincluding examples of the Region\u2019s most successful practices and guidelines recommended for\npro-poor PSP in urban services; and (iii) two subregional workshops to disseminate the results\nand  lessons  to  a  wider  audience  in  the  DMCs.  The  report,  covering  policy,  institutional,\ncontractual, and regulatory frameworks and incentive mechanisms, will be disseminated to\ngovernments,  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  international  organizations  to  use  as  a\nfoundation for country-specific action plans to enhance pro-poor PSP in urban services. It will\nalso examine means by which ADB can further support PSP in urban services. The on-line\ndatabase will provide in-depth analysis of the case studies examined, recommend steps to\nenhance PSP, and be linked to ongoing efforts of other institutions, such as the United Nations\nCenter for Human Settlements (Habitat) Best Practices Database and the multi-agency Water\nand Sanitation Program.11\n                                                \n8 These cities will be selected based on their exemplary provision of urban services to all citizens through public-\nprivate community cooperation. For example, this could cover Hong Kong, China and two cities in Malaysia, as\nwell as a city in Latin America. The latter would be assessed based on available literature only.\n9 A total of 13 cities from 9 countries have been identified as suitable case studies. Confirmation has so far been\nreceived from Chennai, Ho Chi Minh City, Karachi, Malang, Mandaluyong, Naga, Shanghai and Surabaya. An\nindicative list of cities to be included is attached in Appendix 2.\n10 To the extent possible, the reports should cover two or all three subsectors identified.\n11  www.bestpractices.org and www.wsp.org", "5\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent, covering the cost of the\nconsultants, the workshops and the regional forum, publication of final report, and development\nof the on-line database. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded\nTA Program. Details of the cost estimates are given in Appendix 3.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency; ADB\u2019s Water Supply, Urban Development, and\nHousing Division (East) (AEWU) will be responsible for the overall coordination and day-to-day\nmonitoring of all the TA activities. The TA will involve ADB-wide collaboration, including both\nPrograms Departments and both Water Supply, Urban Development, and Housing Divisions,\nthe Office of Pacific Operations, and the Private Sector Group, through a steering committee.\nEfforts will be made to draw from experience of the World Bank, the European Bank for\nReconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank and bilateral funding\nagencies.  Cross-regional  sharing  of  information,  cooperation,  and  collaboration  could  yield\nconsiderable  benefit  and  enhance  the  content  of  the  policy  and  institutional  frameworks\ndeveloped.\n18.  AEWU will supervise and coordinate the work of the consultants. The TA will require one\ninternational consultant with expertise in both large- and small-scale PSP in urban infrastructure\nand services, to be recruited as team leader and for a total of 5 person-months. The consultant\nwill write the theme paper, reviewing experiences of 2-3 cities outside the selected DMCs and\nidentifying practices with potential for replication in DMCs. The consultant will be the lead\nresource person for the inception workshop, the regional forum, and the subregional workshops,\nand will be responsible for preparing the consolidated background report as well as the final\ncomprehensive report. One domestic consultant based in Manila will be recruited for 8 person-\nmonths, acting as the focal point and coordinator of the TA and working closely with ADB staff\nand the team leader. The domestic consultant will assist the team leader in preparing the\nconsolidated background report and the final comprehensive report, as well as assist in the\npreparation of the workshops, forum, and on-line database.12 In addition, domestic consultants\nfor each of the selected countries13 with extensive knowledge in PSP will be recruited on an\nindividual basis for a total of 13 person-months to provide the city reports.\n19.  Individual consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. All TA procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nThe TA, to be undertaken over a period of 10 months, is expected to commence in October\n2000 and conclude in July 2001. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in\nAppendix 4.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$550,000 for the purpose of the study on Public-Private-Community Partnerships in Urban\nServices for the Poor, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n                                                \n12 The domestic consultant will be assisted by one administrative staff, one editor, and one web-site designer.\n13 In countries with two city case studies, the consultant will cover both case studies in one report.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\nGoal\nImprove urban service to poor \u2022  Strengthened private \u2022  Statistics of urban \u2022  Willingness to accept\nhouseholds by increasing public-private- sector participation infrastructure and findings\ncommunity partnership (PSP) in urban service coverage\nservice production \u2022  Surveys among poor \u2022  Willingness to increase\nand delivery households public-private-community\n\u2022  Improved quality and \u2022  Ratios of private and partnership\n(R outreach of urban public provision of urban\ne\nf infrastructure and services\ne\nre services for poor \u2022  Feedback from\nn\nc households governments, the\ne\n in private sector, and\n t nongovernment\ne\nx organizations (NGOs)\nt\n:  6\n p Purpose\na\ng\ne  1.
