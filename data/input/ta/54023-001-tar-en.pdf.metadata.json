INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) operationalize Strategy 2030 for its developing member countries (DMCs) through a \ncohesive approach to implementing the operational plans for Strategy 2030\u2019s seven operational \npriorities.1 The TA will (i) help integrate the operational plans in country partnership strategies \n(CPSs) and projects; (ii) promote innovative knowledge solutions and help develop DMC capacity, \nand (iii) enhance monitoring and reporting of the operational plans. These activities will enable \nADB to better help DMCs promote more effective, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth.  \n \n2.  The TA was endorsed during the corporate priority framework meeting in November 2019 \nand is included in the 2020 Management approved results-based work plan of the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department (SDCC).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In October 2019, ADB approved the operational plans for each of the seven operational \npriorities of Strategy 2030.3 The operational plans endeavor to guide ADB operations and offer \nnew opportunities to implement Strategy 2030 using integrated and differentiated approaches in \nproject  design,  knowledge  work,  and  financing.  ADB  has  not  fully  applied  innovative  and \nintegrated  approaches  to  address  key  development  challenges  in  DMCs  because  it  lacks \nupstream analyses and full integration of inter-sectoral and thematic linkages in country strategies \nand project designs. Knowledge gaps also exist because of varying levels of available information \nand capacity within countries and across subregions. DMCs in Asia and the Pacific also face \nserious challenges (paras. 4\u201313) including the onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic. The approval of the Strategy 2030 operational plans marked the beginning of new \npathways that will allow the ADB to respond effectively to these challenges in Asia and the Pacific. \nThis TA will support that response. \n \n4.  The increased challenge and urgency of implementing Strategy 2030 during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and necessary measures to control its spread \nhave created both a health crisis and massive economic and social shock that threatens to send \nmillions into poverty. The course of the pandemic remains highly uncertain, with direct health and \neconomic impacts that could last well into 2021, and financial, fiscal, and sectoral impacts that \ncould extend into the following years. DMCs will need integrated solutions that can help address \nthe extended challenge and ongoing uncertainty. In particular, the CPSs will have to build in new \ndevelopment pathways to address the challenges faced by DMCs. This TA will contribute to these \npathways. \n \n5.  Remaining poverty and inequality in the face of demographic transition. In Asia and \nthe Pacific, despite decades of sustained growth and the fact that around 95% of the population \nlive in middle-income countries, some 263 million people live below the $1.90 per day poverty \nline, and around 1.1 billion live on less than $3.20 per day.4 Asia and the Pacific is also both the \nyoungest and the fastest-aging region of the world. With 2 billion people under age 30 (nearly half \nof the total population), the region requires generation of quality jobs, investments in the future of \nyouth, development of human capital, and new forms of social protection to address vulnerabilities \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila.  https://www.adb.org/about/strategy-2030-operational-priorities  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 September 2020. \n3  Detailed assessments of issues described in this section and references for all statistics are in the operational plans.  \n  ADB. 2020. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2020. Manila. \n ", "2 \nin changing workforces.5 The region is also home to more than half of the world\u2019s population of \npeople over age 60 and is expected to be home to nearly two-thirds of the global population over \nthe age of 60, or close to 1.3 billion people, by 2050.6 Protection against the risk of poverty in old \nage is strikingly absent for informal sector workers and persons with disabilities. An immediate \nchallenge is to develop social protection and health and long-term care systems and services \n(including human resources) that are inclusive, responsive to DMC contexts, affordable, and \naccessible. COVID-19 and the necessary policy response has compounded these challenges, \nstraining health care systems, plunging millions more into poverty, requiring mobilization of huge \nsocial assistance, and severely disrupting education. \n \n6.  Slow progress on gender equality. Despite significant achievements, persistent gender \ngaps remain. In developing countries of Asia and the Pacific, women are on average 30% less \nlikely than men to be in the workforce.7 Female labor force participation in the region fell from 56% \nin 1990 to 46% in 2017.8 On average in the region, women earn 77% of men\u2019s wages, but there \nare huge variations across countries and industries.9 Though the region has seen improved trends \nin school enrollment for girls at primary and secondary level, challenges to integrate more young \ngirls into science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and information and communication \ntechnologies still persist. Gender based violence remains a challenge in the region, especially in \nSouth Asia and the Pacific. Long term lockdowns and quarantines have made gender based \nviolence worse during the pandemic, and many women owned and operated small businesses \nhave been forced to close or cut back operations. \n \n7.  Increasing environmental degradation and risks and vulnerability to climate change. \nThe region\u2019s large and diverse ecosystems sustain livelihoods, support food production, provide \nwater  and  energy security,  and  provide  resilience  to  climate  and  disaster risks.  A  sizable \nproportion  of  the  region's  population  still  works  in  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  forestry\u2014the \nproductive sectors most at risk from climate change and extreme weather events. The poor are \nparticularly vulnerable because they disproportionately rely on ecosystem services for their \nlivelihoods and food security. DMCs face growing environmental pressures, including air, land, \nfreshwater,  and  marine  pollution;  inadequate  waste  management;  ecosystem  degradation, \nincluding deforestation and biodiversity loss; and unsustainable resource management practices, \nincluding unsustainable fishing and groundwater extraction. Climate change is also a major threat \nto sustainability at all levels. Globally about half of all greenhouse gas emissions come from Asia, \nwhich are set to increase in step with economic growth.10 Many DMCs, particularly low-lying and \nsmall island developing states, are highly vulnerable to natural hazards and impacts of climate \nchange. Disaster losses are growing because of insufficient regard for climate and disaster risk.  \n \n8.  Declining livability of growing cities. Urbanization in the region has increased from \nabout 20% in the 1950s to about 48% in 2018. By 2030, the share of the urban population is \n \n5  United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 2017. World Population Prospects: \nThe 2017 Revision.

Population migration from rural to urban areas is often associated with economic \nopportunities, better access to health and education services, and improved living conditions. At \nthe same time, cities in the region are growing larger and becoming more difficult to manage; they \nneed to reverse environmental degradation and address massive shortfalls in urban infrastructure. \nCities, especially coastal low-lying ones, are also increasingly vulnerable to natural hazards. \nCOVID-19 has caused large financial losses for urban transit systems, lowered municipal tax \nrevenues, and raised questions about high density urban living. \n \n9.  Stagnating growth in rural areas. The agriculture and natural resources sectors suffer \nfrom lagging rural development, inefficient agricultural markets, poor soil and water resources \nmanagement, diminishing youth interest, and climate change impacts. Rural areas still have an \ninsufficient number of rural roads, electric grids, and access to basic health, education, water, and \nsanitation. Investments in these areas are often lower compared to urban areas. Insufficient \nagricultural markets result in 30%\u201340% post-harvest losses and exacerbate the inability of \nsmallholders to earn livable incomes. This creates pressure to adopt unsustainable farming \npractices that pollute soil and water resources and leads to over-harvesting of forests and \nfisheries. Increasing numbers of women farmers suffer from limited access to support services \nand agricultural inputs. The impacts of climate change (for example, increased incidences of \nfloods and droughts) are causing high production losses and lower yields. \n \n10.  Weaknesses in public sector governance and service delivery. Problems with public \nsector management create serious challenges for DMCs in meeting the Sustainable Development \nGoals. About 350 million people in the region are still without electricity, 600 million lack improved \nsources of drinking water, 1.5 billion lack improved sanitation facilities, and 1 billion live more than \n2 kilometers from an all-season road. Stronger institutional development founded on better quality \ninfrastructure, operating in many instances across more effective state-owned enterprises, can \nimprove service delivery and value addition. Shortcomings on domestic resource mobilization \nneed to be addressed, as tax yields across DMCs average 17% or half of the average of 34% in \nthe countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The quality and \noutreach of services at the subnational level also need systematic strengthening because local \ngovernments are responsible for 65% of the 169 Sustainable Development Goal targets. The \npandemic has put huge pressure on governments to improve service delivery while facing growing \nrevenue shortfalls, further weakening debt sustainability in many countries.     \n \n11.  Gaps in connectivity, pressure on trade, and insufficient regional public goods. The \noverall level of regional cooperation and integration in Asia and the Pacific has been rising, but \nwith varied progress across subregions.13 Large investments are needed to bridge regional \nconnectivity gaps (inter-regional and intra-regional), especially in South Asia and Central Asia, by \nbuilding high quality connectivity (including digital connectivity) that will support green recovery, \nincorporate  health  resilience,  and  promote  private  sector  participation  and  private\u2013public \npartnership.14 In the context of a weakened multilateral trade system, it is important to sustain \nAsia\u2019s trade performance by helping new regional trade and investment agreements progress and \n \n11 United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division.  2018.

Asia\u2019s growth is increasing stress on \nthe environment and causing other risks, requiring increased attention to promoting regional \npublic goods. The private sector needs to engage more systematically in the regional cooperation \nand integration agenda. COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented global decline in trade and travel \nand disrupted international financial flows. It has also made regional cooperation on health and \nother areas all the more urgent. \n \n12.  Rapid changes in digital technology. Artificial intelligence, big data, digital platforms, \nand other aspects of the digital transformation will fundamentally alter the way the world lives, \nworks, and connects. While it creates new opportunities, it also makes skills development and \nlifelong learning more important, and requires new forms of social protection to address new \nvulnerabilities resulting from the informality, temporality, and mobility of work. Ensuring access to \naffordable digital technology and using it to improve access to and quality of services, including \nimproving governance and public administration will be essential to addressing inequality. COVID-\n19 has forced millions to work and attend school from home and has made digital connectivity \nand security all the more important.  \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value addition.  Strategy 2030 calls for effectively incorporating inter-sectoral and \nthematic linkages into country strategies and project designs. ADB will need to address potential \nmismatches in response to evolving development challenges, including in sector-silo approaches \nand insufficient evidence-based design and implementation of projects and programs. This TA is \ndesigned to support the implementation of the Strategy 2030 operational plans by mainstreaming \nthem in country programs and project designs to promote integrated approaches and improve \ncost efficiency and effectiveness of ADB projects and programs, ensuring less fragmentation of \nresources and avoiding duplication of effort. Through this TA, ADB will help DMCs (i) address \ntheir development challenges (paras. 4-13) through improved, demand driven operations; (ii) use \ncountry-focused and differentiated approaches; (iii) deliver One ADB integrated solutions and \nmultisectoral  approaches;  (iv)  promote  innovative  technologies;  (v)  expand  private  sector \noperations; (vi) develop capacity; and (vii) maximize development impacts. The seven Strategy \n2030 operational plans recognize that development challenges are increasingly complex and \nrequire solutions that are interlinked across themes and sectors. The proposed TA will support \nholistic approaches to strengthen complementarity and reinforce integrated solutions.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Results of ADB Strategy 2030 operational \nplans achieved in DMCs.15 The TA will have the following outcome: Integration of innovative \napproaches in development strategies and projects in selected DMCs increased.16 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n15.  The proposed TA will support three outputs, as follows.17 \n \n \n15 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n17  An indicative list of activities, organized by output and operational plan, is in the linked documents.  \n ", "5 \n16.  Output 1: Alignment of country partnership strategies, investment projects, and \nprograms  with  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  improved.  The  TA  should  support \nimplementation of the seven operational plans through enhanced technical support and facilitating \ncollaboration between operations and knowledge departments. Each operational plan identifies \n(i) strategic priorities to guide ADB operations and (ii) new opportunities to implement Strategy \n2030 through innovative project design, knowledge products and services, and financing products. \nWorking with operations departments, the TA will support country-level dialogues with DMC \ngovernment stakeholders to focus ADB assistance in the priority areas of Strategy 2030 and \nidentify expertise that may be needed to prepare upstream inter-sectoral analyses and other \ncross-sectoral and thematic work to enhance CPS (building on the Inclusive and Sustainable \nGrowth Assessment) and project design. Through these dialogues and in partnership with \noperations departments and the Strategy, Policy, and Partnerships Department (SPD), the TA will \nhelp sector and thematic experts engage in addressing development challenges (some of which \nare highlighted in paras. 4\u201313) by promoting more integrated approaches and helping translate \nthese approaches in country strategies and project designs. It is expected that this output will help \nat least five CPSs to reflect new approaches derived from new analytical work that can pave the \nway  for  operational  pipelines  that  will  be  country  focused,  promote  the  use  of  innovative \ntechnologies, and deliver integrated solutions. \n \n17.  Output 2: Innovative knowledge solutions and institutional capacity development \nsupported. Working closely with operations departments, the TA will support country-level and \nregional dialogues to identify and increase capacity around areas where knowledge gaps exist \nthat the TA support can help close. As with output 1, the rationale section highlights some of the \nkey current and emerging issues with limited knowledge bases. The TA will help close knowledge \ngaps in some critical development challenges that confront DMCs and that arise from changing \nsocio-economic  and  political  landscapes,  demographic  shifts,  increased  globalization, \ntechnological  change,  increased  vulnerabilities  to  environmental  risks,  health-related \nemergencies, and natural hazards and climate change, among others. The TA will help develop \nknowledge products and services that will provide upstream analytical support to operations \ndepartments, including inter-sectoral analyses.  \n \n18.  Working with operations departments, the TA will also support capacity building through \ntraining  and  policy  dialogues  and  will  convene  cross-sector  and  cross-thematic  knowledge \nsharing events to address specific needs of DMCs. This component will include awareness \ncampaigns, capacity-building activities, conferences and workshops, and publication of lessons \nlearned. The knowledge products will be shared publicly and also disseminated in ADB websites. \nInterventions under the TA will take into account the differentiated approach needed in DMCs, \nincluding small island developing states and fragile and conflict-affected situations.18 The TA will \nalso support opportunities for ADB to engage with citizens, including youth and persons with \ndisabilities. \n \n19.  Output 3: Implementation of operational plans monitored and reported. The seven \noperational plans have results frameworks that have been incorporated in the corporate results \nframework. The indicators reflect key development challenges that mirror current and emerging \nissues faced by DMCs. The TA will also help collect and analyze data on some development \nindicators and help prepare monitoring reports for some operational plans. SDCC will work with \nSPD to support data collection and data analysis of some development indicators and preparation \n \n18 This TA will complement activities supported by the ADB corporate TA on Enhancing Differentiated Approaches in \nContext Sensitive Situations approved in June 2020. \n ", "6 \nof monitoring reports for some operational plans. The TA will also help prepare communication \nplans to better disseminate results to ADB clients and other stakeholders, particularly in DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $4,750,000, to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF), of which $1,000,000 is from TASF-6 and $3,750,000 \nis from TASF-other sources. The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB will serve as the executing and implementing agency for the TA. The Sector Advisory \nService Cluster and the Thematic Advisory Service Cluster in SDCC will jointly administer and \nimplement the TA. Operational plan leads will work directly with operations departments and \nthrough  the  sector  and  thematic  group  committees  where  operations  departments  are  all \nrepresented to ensure that TA activities are demand driven, do not duplicate existing TA activities, \nand address the priorities of operations departments. SDCC will also ensure that consultants and \nactivities under this TA are properly coordinated and work together in an integrated fashion. They \nwill also work with SPD under output 3. Both the TA annual program and its progress will be \nreviewed every six months by SDCC management and the seven operational plan leads, in \ncooperation with the chiefs of all sector and thematic groups. SDCC will prioritize and finalize TA \nactivities that support operations departments after consulting with sector and thematic group \ncommittees. SDCC will implement country-level activities after securing government concurrence \nfrom respective DMCs in coordination with operations departments, including with the ADB \nresident missions. The TA implementation period will be 42 months, starting in October 2020. An \nindicative list of activities to be carried out under this TA is in the linked documents.  \n \n22.
