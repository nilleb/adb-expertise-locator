As agreed with His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal (the Government) during the 2002 \nCountry Program Mission, and as reflected in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Country \nStrategy and Program for Nepal for 2003-2005, a social protection study (the Study) has been \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country program for 2003.1 In 2001, ADB approved its Social Protection \nStrategy. The Study will assist the Government to develop a country social protection strategy. \nADB is already assisting the Government in areas contributing to social protection, mainly \nthrough the regional technical assistance (TA) on \"Strengthening the Role of International Labor \nStandards in Selected Developing Member Countries of the Asian Development Bank\" and a TA \non \"Developing Insurance, Pensions, and Contractual Savings.\"2  \n \n2.  A Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal from 16 to 22 January 2003 to discuss with the \nGovernment the objectives, scope, and outline of the Study. The Mission also held discussions \nwith bilateral and international development partners. The TA framework is shown in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Nepal is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world, with $236 gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita (2002).3 High population growth is one of the reasons for a \nlow per capita GDP. Approximately half of its population of 23.2 million is living below the \npoverty line. Life expectancy is 58.5 years, and Nepal is one of two countries worldwide where \nlife expectancy for men is higher than for women. Nepal is predominantly rural, and 80% of the \npopulation lives on agriculture, which accounts for 40% of GDP. While per capita income grew \nat a rate of about 2.7% during the 1990s, the incidence of poverty has remained high, largely \nbecause of the disparities in ownership of productive resources \u2013 both capital and noncapital \u2013 \nand access to them.4 \n \n4.  The international community is financing 60% of Nepal\u2019s development budget and 30% \nof total budget expenditures. Remittances from abroad amount to 25% of GDP. Even if human \ndevelopment  indicators  for  Nepal  have  increased  over  the  last  decade,  the  levels  of  the \nindicators  are  low,  even  by  South  Asian  standards.  The  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP) ranks Nepal among the countries with a low Human Development Index \n(0.466, rank number 142). Lack of access to basic health services and education, malnutrition, \nhigh rates of infant, and maternal mortality are the most evident results of rampant poverty. In \naddition, inequalities in the distribution of education, health, and other related opportunities \nremain pronounced at the regional, urban-rural, gender, and ethnic dimensions. Child labor is \nprevalent, and is significantly higher in districts that have a higher incidence of poverty and \nlower level of educational attainment, particularly of females. According to a recent International \nLabour  Organisation  (ILO)  study,  in  Nepal  there  are  2.6  million  children  (7\u201315 years old) \nworking, 179,000 of them in the worst forms of child labor (like hazardous work and prostitution). \nTrafficking of children and women as well as violence against women are problems that require \nadditional attention. \n \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 28 August 2002. \n2  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n3  Among the ADB developing member countries, only Afghanistan and Tajikistan have a lower per capita GDP. \n4  UNDP: Nepal Human Development Report 2001. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Since 7 years ago, the country has been facing a serious and violent insurgency that has \nadversely affected the economy and development work,  and that has already cost several \nthousand lives. On the economic front, the insurgency has been a major factor leading to the \nrecent sharp fall in GDP growth, having had a particularly serious impact on both the tourism \nand industry sectors (GDP per capita fell from $244 in 1999/2000 to $236 in 2001/2002).5 \nAlthough the insurgency was initially concentrated in the mid-west and parts of the central \nregion, it is now a much more widespread phenomenon. Recent upsurges of violence have \nhindered delivery of basic services and both public and private sector activities, adversely \naffecting livelihoods, particularly in rural areas. Many families have been displaced, and the \navailability of social protection at a time of increasing insecurity has taken a new urgency. \nUnequal development, poverty, and high underemployment in a stratified society characterized \nby social exclusion and gender discrimination have provided a fertile ground for the present \ninsurgency to flourish. As mentioned before, the country's human development status remains \namong the lowest in the world. Despite progress made, human capital formation and human \nresource development remain inadequate, and great disparities between men and women, \ndifferent caste and ethnic groups, and different geographic regions persist, which lead to social \nexclusion.6 The Government and the insurgents announced a cease fire on 29 January 2003, \npaving the way for peace talks and the initiation of a process of healing and reconciliation. New \nmechanisms  that  reflect  the  dimension  of  vulnerability  among  different  categories  of \npopulations\u2014 men, women, and disadvantaged groups \u2014 will need to be analyzed to determine \ngroup-specific needs. \n \n6.  Social protection is very limited in Nepal. This counts for all the five areas of social \nprotection identified by the ADB Social Protection Strategy (labor markets, social insurance, \nsocial  assistance,  micro-schemes,  and  child  protection).  Concerning  labor  markets,  formal \nsector employment is almost stagnant, and the growing labor force is mainly joining the informal \nsector. While it is difficult to determine the size of the informal sector \u2013 due to its nature, being \nunorganized and unregulated \u2013 it is estimated that more than 60% of employed workers are in \nthe informal sector. Among those, a much higher proportion of women than men are found.  The \ninformal sector is characterized by variation in wage rates, conditions of employment, and \ndiscrimination based on gender and age. \n \n7.  The Labor Act, which applies to all enterprises with more than five employees and those \nin industrial districts, provides for some basic protection like number of monthly payments, \nseverance  pay,  and  protection  against  layoffs,  which  requires  the  approval  of  the  Labor \nDepartment. In spite of the basic character of these protection arrangements, they still lead to \nincreased employer preference to employ on a nonformal basis (without contract). This is the \nreason why there is felt to be a need to amend the Labor Act to make it more flexible and in line \nwith the introduction  of better basic social insurance arrangements that take into account \nvulnerable populations\u2019 ability to cope with threats to income and livelihood.  \n \n8.  At present, the formal social security systems (provident fund and citizen\u2019s investment \nfund) cover mainly civil servants, army, police, and teachers. In total, about 400,000 government \nofficials are covered. The Government is the single largest employer in the country. Any private \nenterprise with more than 10 employees can join the provident fund on a voluntary basis. All \nenterprises can join the retirement plan under the citizen\u2019s investment fund. However, there is \nno mandatory social insurance provision for the private sector.  \n \n                                                 \n5  Central Bureau of Statistics. 2003. \n6  UNDP. 2002. Human Development Report. Kathmandu. ", "    3 \n9.  Apart from the formal sector social security provisions, there are various informal, partly \ntraditional, community-based insurance arrangements (micro-insurance). A Ministry of Health \n(MOH)  task  force  is  working  on  a  strategy  to  extend  health  insurance  coverage.  Health \ninsurance is one of the top agenda items of MOH. ILO is assisting the Government in this issue. \n \n10.  Social welfare arrangements for certain groups, mainly under the Ministry of Women, \nChildren and Social Welfare (MWCSW) (elderly, disabled, widows, internally displaced persons \ndue to the insurgency, children, and victims of natural calamities), depend very much on the \navailability of funds and are in general low. It is estimated that 41% of children aged 5\u201314 and \n21%  of  children  aged  5\u20139  work.  Concerning  child  protection,  various  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) (about 30) address street children, working children, and trafficked and \nmigrant children. The Government has committed itself to eliminate the worst forms of child \nlabor and to eliminate all kinds of child labor by 2010. Most of the social protection programs are \nunder  MWCSW,  but  other  ministries  like  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  MOH,  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment, and Ministry of Education and Sports are involved in social protection programs. \nMOH is running a network of 69 district hospitals (out of 75 districts) and about 4,000 primary \nhealth care centers and subhealth posts. For insurgency-prone areas, the Ministry of Home \nAffairs and the Ministry of Defense run rehabilitation programs and rescue operations for \naffected communities including housing and life skills development. \n \n11.  Many projects and activities, mainly financed by international development partners, \nhave links to social protection. ILO is playing a particularly active role in this area, having \npublished several studies and intervened in the fields of child labor, micro-insurance (health, \nlivestock, life), social protection for informal sector workers, occupational safety and health, \nmaternal protection for the informal sector, reproductive health, sexual harassment at the \nworkplace, and the development of a Social Protection Act. Some other agencies involved in \nsocial protection activities are the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund in the field of child protection, \nNorwegian Agency for International Development, Danish International Development Agency, \nGerman Agency for Technical Cooperation, World Bank through the poverty alleviation fund, \nand United Nations Fund for Population Activities (in the field of quality of care and micro-\ninsurance). \n \n12.  Currently, the various existing schemes and activities in the field of  social protection \nremain scattered. While these activities bring benefits, they rarely contribute towards strategic \nchange unless these are linked to policy development. Hence, this would be very important as a \nbasis for the development of a social protection strategy for the country. \n \n13.  Basically the question of affordability and sustainability of social protection in a country \nwhere economic indicators are worsening has to be raised. Economic growth may be one \nsource that can support social protection. But often, as seen in Pakistan for example, it benefits \nonly part of the population and does not lead to a linear increase of welfare. Therefore, growth \nhas to be pro-poor and socially inclusive. Social protection can be one element contributing to \nthis if the poor have mechanisms that protect them form shocks and increase their ability to take \nrisks to pursue livelihood. Social protection interventions can have positive effects on the \ndemand and the willingness of people to take risks, and can contribute to building social \ncohesion and social stability in the country. The right moment to start a discussion is when the \nproblems emerge in order to be prepared for and to prepare pro-poor growth. Therefore, it is \nnecessary to raise the question, what can be the sources of funding for social protection \nmeasures? (i) It can be changing budget allocation. For this purpose, there is a need to show \nthe Government what can be done with social protection, what are the benefits, and what it \ncosts. (ii) Existing programs can be analyzed to optimize the use of scarce funds. (iii) It can be ", "4 \n \nforeign aid. However, this faces the risk of not being sustainable. Therefore a long-term strategy \nis needed showing where funds might be needed. (iv) It can be individual contribution (risk \npooling). Micro-insurance schemes have shown that they can protect people from economic \nrisks like sickness, old age poverty, and natural disasters. But also an extension of existing \nsocial insurance schemes may be an option. (v) Borrowing money for investment into know-\nhow,  awareness,  gathering  support,  institutional  development,  and  legislation  is  also  a \npossibility; but maybe there is not much use in paying social protection benefits from loans, \nunless it is for pilot projects or for emergencies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  developing  a  comprehensive  national  social \nprotection strategy that will not only help reduce the vulnerability of the most needy and \ndisadvantaged sections of society, but will  also ensure adequate coverage for most of the \npopulation and contribute towards translating the Government\u2019s policy objective of poverty \nreduction into effective programs. It will also form the basis for comprehensive training of \ngovernment staff in the field of social protection. This study will be in line with the ADB social \nprotection strategy.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will provide a comprehensive analysis of the sector and will contribute to the \nelaboration of a social protection strategy  for  the  country,  and  will  thus  be  the  basis  for \ndiscussion of further ADB projects in this field. The following activities will be carried out: (i) \nconduct a situation analysis and needs assessment; (ii) elaborate an inventory of existing \nprograms and projects, including nonformal and traditional arrangements of social protection; \n(iii) identify the involvement of NGOs and bilateral and international development partners; (iv) \nidentify gaps; and (v) elaborate recommendations for strategic interventions. A tentative outline \nfor the Study is provided in Appendix 2. \n  \n16.  The Study will also look into social protection programs that can contribute to the peace \nprocess. While the peace process includes three critical elements \u2014 (i) a political solution, (ii) \nhuman rights, and (iii) risk management \u2014 the social protection study will address only the third \nelement, with the intention of identifying implementable solutions.  \n \n17.  The Study will develop proposals for a strategy through a participatory process in which \ngovernment agencies, development partners, and especially the communities will be involved. \nSeveral  workshops  will  be  held  with  government  agencies  involved  in  social  protection, \ndevelopment partners, NGOs, and academics. \n \n18.  The  study  will  provide  the  Government  with  a  proposal  for  a  comprehensive  and \ncoordinated plan of social protection development including (i) a definition of social protection in \nNepal; (ii) priority areas of intervention including a ranking of priorities \u2013 with a special focus on \nself-sustaining social protection mechanisms; (iii) target groups; (iv) identification of needs for \ninstitutional development; (v) costs of proposed interventions and financing options; and (vi) \npossible involvement of the Government, development partners, and ADB. The study will be \nclosely coordinated with the ministries involved and other development partners. It will build on \na series of studies and project carried out by ILO, which has indicated a willingness to share its \nexperience and to be closely involved in the study.  ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000 equivalent, of which $172,000 will be \nforeign exchange costs and $128,000 equivalent will be local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$250,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange costs and $78,000 equivalent \nin  local  currency  costs.  The  remaining  $50,000  equivalent  will  be  contributed  by  the \nGovernment and will include office accommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, surveys, \nand workshops. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown \nin Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  MWCSW,  which  will  be  in  charge  of \ncoordination  with  the  other  agencies  involved.  A  steering  committee,  headed  by  the  joint \nsecretary  of  MWCSW,  will  be  established.  Members  of  the  steering  committee  will  be \nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Finance, National Planning Commission, MOH, Ministry of \nHome Affairs, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Local Development, and Ministry of Labor. The \nconsulting team and the steering committee will be assisted by a technical working group, the \nmain task of which (Appendix 4) is to serve as a critical partner in reviewing the outputs, give \nadvice on optimizing the results, and support the project in specific areas. \n \n21.  The TA will be carried out over 5 months, beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The \nexpected completion date will be January 2004. There will be a total input of 18 person-months \nof  consultancy:  6  international  and  12  domestic.  The  consulting  team  will  include  as \ninternational consultants a social protection specialist and team leader (5 person-months) and a \nrisk management (conflict resolution) specialist (1 person-month); and as domestic consultants \nan economist specialized in social protection (3 person-months), a legal specialist specialized in \nsocial and labor law (3 person-months), a community development and gender specialist (3 \nperson-months),  and  a  poverty  analyst  (3  person-months).  The  proposed  recruitment  of \ninternational consultants for the first two positions, as well as the overall balance between \ninternational and domestic consultants, has been fully discussed and agreed upon between the \nGovernment and the Mission. All consultants will be recruited through a firm using a simplified \ntechnical proposal, in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for the recruitment of consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB  for the engagement of domestic consultants. The \nquality and cost-based selection method will be used. A project director from MWCSW will be \nnominated. The consultants will submit three reports: an inception report no later than 2 weeks \nafter fielding the consultants, a draft final report 4 months after inception, and the final report \nwithin 1 month after receiving comments from the review of the draft by the Government and \nADB. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for preparing the Social Protection Study, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.
