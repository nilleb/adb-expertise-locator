I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission and Distribution System Improvement \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project undertakes selective transmission and distribution (T&D) system \nimprovements critical for meeting the growing demand for power in Madhya Pradesh. It also \nundertakes capacity building activities to ensure the institutional sustainability of the Madhya \nPradesh power sector and improved service delivery to consumers. The project supports the \ninstallation of T&D assets necessary for capacity enhancement in the operational areas of the \ntransmission company and the three distribution companies in Madhya Pradesh.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale  \n3.  The peak availability in the Madhya Pradesh power sector was 9,692 megawatts (MW) \nwhile the estimated unrestricted peak demand was 10,308 MW, resulting in an unmet peak \ndemand  of  616  MW  in  FY2012.  The  state  has  8.2  million  electricity  customers,  of  which \n6.1 million are household customers. Expansion of the distribution system with new power \nconnections  to  households,  increased  consumption  from  existing  customers,  and  the  fast \neconomic growth of the state are expected to increase the demand for electricity rapidly.3 \nDemand for electricity grew at about 13% per annum during FY2009\u2013FY2012 and is predicted \nto grow by over 11% per annum during FY2012\u2013FY2016. By FY2016, the T&D system should \ndeliver about 7,000 MW of additional power to customers. An estimated 20% T&D capacity gap \nmay result by 2017 if T&D capacity is not enhanced. The proposed investments in T&D aim at \nremoving  existing  bottlenecks  and  expanding  the  T&D  system  capacity  to  meet  growing \ndemand.  \n \n4.  Access to power remains a challenge in Madhya Pradesh, with only about 67% of \nhouseholds connected to the system. Quality of power and reliability of service are also below \nthe standards expected of a modern public electricity network\u2014power supply was limited to     \n6\u20138 hours per day for rural households in FY2010.4 A substantial amount of investments are \nrequired for upgrades and reconfigurations of the medium- and low-voltage distribution networks \nto meet the growing demand and to improve the quality of services. The gap between supply \nand demand continues to be a concern, requiring load shedding throughout the year, which is \nlikely to continue if necessary investments in T&D system are not made. Distribution losses had \nbeen very high, especially in rural areas where distribution lines are overloaded. Unmetered \nconnections and theft caused distribution losses to be as high as 46% in FY2004. These losses \nhave fallen to about 27% in FY2012 because of a series of government and Asian Development \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2013. Technical \nAssistance to India for Preparing Madhya Pradesh Transmission and Distribution System Improvement Project. \nManila. \n3  The Madhya Pradesh economy has been growing faster than the Indian economy since 2009, and is predicted to \ngrow at 10% in 2013, which is the highest among Indian states.  \n4  This situation is changing rapidly, with implementation of the feeder separation program for which ADB provided a \n$400 million multitranche financing facility; ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility and Technical Assistance Grant to India for the Madhya \nPradesh Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Program. Manila (Loan 2764-IND and Loan 2830-IND). Some \ndistricts in Madhya Pradesh are already receiving 24-hour power supply.  ", "2 \nBank (ADB)  interventions  in  the  sector,  and are  predicted to  be  about  17%  by  FY2014.5 \nSubsidized electricity served to agricultural water pumping also requires rationing to minimize \nfinancial losses to distribution companies.  \n \n5.  The Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) undertook a successful sector reform \nprogram,  with  ADB  assistance,  to  solve  power  sector  problems.6 It  unbundled  the  State \nElectricity Board and created six companies, segregating the generation and T&D functions. \nMadhya Pradesh has a reasonably well-functioning regulatory commission now\u2014the Madhya \nPradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC), which oversees the quality of service \ndelivery and issues tariff orders. The transmission business and the generation business have \nbeen  revenue  independent  since  FY2012.7 The  last  milestone  of  the  reforms\u2014revenue \nindependence of the three distribution companies\u2014was achieved in March 2013. This was the \nmain  reform  condition  included  in  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  Feeder  Separation  Program. \nAccordingly, each distribution company would be fully responsible for efficient management of \nits distribution business through independent decision making on new investments, hiring and \nfiring,  loss  management,  and  monitoring  such  that  the  expected  revenue  allowed  by  the \nMPERC would be realized. Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board, the predecessor of the new \npower companies, was dissolved on 26 April 2012. All employees have been assigned to each \nrespective successor company. The proposed loan will enable the Madhya Pradesh power \nsector to reap the full benefits of already undertaken reforms. \n \n6.  GOMP also undertook a series of investments to solve power sector problems, with \nassistance from development partners. ADB has approved about $1.37 billion worth of support \nfor power sector reforms and investment projects (mainly for T&D improvements) since 2001. \nGOMP\u2019s  own  programs  include  (i)  Rajiv  Gandhi  Grameen  Vidyutikaran  Yojana,  aimed  at \ndistribution improvements for new household connections in rural areas; (ii) the Restructured \nAccelerated  Power  Development  Reforms  Program,  to  improve  electricity  distribution \ninfrastructure in urban areas; and (iii) the Feeder Separation Program, to provide agricultural \nconsumers with 10 hours of supply and rural households with 24-hour power supply. The first \ntwo  programs  initially  provided  about  $1,060  million  and  further  allocated  $545 million  for \nFY2013\u2013FY2016. The Feeder Separation Program costs about $1.1 billion and ADB provided a \n$400 million multitranche financing facility in two tranches. These programs are at various \nstages of implementation and the expected outcome\u201424-hour power supply to households\u2014\ncannot be sustained without removing the remaining constraints in the T&D system.   \n \n7.  Generation  capacity  in Madhya  Pradesh  expanded  rapidly  parallel  to the growth  in \ndemand. In FY2003, it had available capacity of 2,990 MW and by FY2012 its generation \ncapacity increased to about 10,400 MW. Following the central government\u2019s policy directive of \npromoting private sector participation in generation, GOMP launched a program for independent \npower  producers  to  produce  electricity  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  GOMP  has  signed \n49 memorandums of understanding with private generating companies, and about 10,000 MW \ncapacity projects for independent power producers are in various stages of implementation. In \n2013, the private sector is expected to commission 1,540 MW of projects. According to the \ngeneration plan of Madhya Pradesh, from FY2013 to FY2020 a total of 14,554 MW capacity will \nbe added to the system and Madhya Pradesh is predicted to have a generation surplus from \n                                                \n5  The tariff order of the Madhya Pradesh Energy Regulatory Commission (MPERC) for FY2013-FY2014 (March \n2013) requires distribution companies to reduce losses to17%. \n6  Review of Power Sector Reforms (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  After unbundling the power sector to six companies, revenues were collected and salaries and other dues were \npaid by the State Electricity Board. Revenue independence allows the companies to collect its own revenue and \nallocate the collected revenue to meet expenses and future investments. \n ", "3 \nFY2013 onward. The T&D systems require capacity expansion commensurate with generation \nexpansion. \n \n8.  The transmission network of the state operates at 132-kilovolt (kV), 220 kV, and 400 kV \ncapacities.  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Transmission  Company  (MP  Transco)  reported  a \ntransmission loss of 7.9% in FY2003 (when the company was formed), which declined to 3.3% \nby FY2012. Transmission system availability increased from 98.4% in FY2005 to 99.4% in \nFY2012.  Transmission  substations  also  increased  from  141  in  2003  to  248  in  2012. \nTransmission line length increased from 17,500 to 27,000 circuit-kilometers (km) over the same \n10-year period. Over the current 12th five-year plan period, 2012\u20132017, MP Transco plans to \nbuild a further 10,500 circuit-km of transmission lines and 94 transmission substations to serve \nthe growing demand, clear bottlenecks and congestions, maintain energy losses at about 3%, \nand improve system reliability.8 The estimated investment requirement of MP Transco for the \nproposed expansion is $1,474 million. Of the total, MP Transco invested $574 million and Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  provided  a  loan  of  $200  million.  The  company  plans  to \nfinance  the  rest  through  borrowings  from  development  partners,  GOMP,  and  from  the \ncompany\u2019s own resources. The proposed loan provides part of the remaining requirement. MP \nTransco is projected to be operating with a reasonable profit from FY2013 onward so that it is in \na position to repay its debt obligations.  \n \n9.  The distribution network of the state operates at 33 kV, 11 kV, and 400 kV capacities. It \nis owned and operated by three distribution companies\u2014Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra \nVidyut  Vitaran  Company  (DISCOM-C);  Madhya  Pradesh  Poorv  Kshetra  Vidyut  Vitaran \nCompany  (DISCOM-E);  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Paschim  Kshetra  Vidyut  Vitaran  Company \n(DISCOM-W). The Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company (previously the Madhya \nPradesh Power Trading Company) is the holding company for the three distribution companies. \nAs mentioned above, several initiatives to reduce technical and commercial losses in electricity \ndistribution  have  been  taken.  Along  with  the  Feeder  Separation  Program,  supply  to  rural \nhouseholds  is  being  rearranged  through  high-voltage  distribution  systems,  resulting  in \ncommercial  loss  reductions.  To  accelerate  the  distribution  companies\u2019  efforts  to  curtail \ncommercial losses through unmetered connections, MPERC issued a directive in March 2013 \nfor all unmetered urban domestic connections to be provided with meters by June 2013, and all \nunmetered rural domestic connections to be provided with meters by March 2014. The ongoing \nFeeder Separation Program, includes provision of meters to rural customers, and the metering \nof distribution transformers serving agricultural water pumps. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s investments in Madhya Pradesh\u2014through the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector \nDevelopment Program,9 Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Investment Program,10 and Madhya \nPradesh Energy Efficiency Investment Program11\u2014were directed at (i) expanding the T&D \nsystem, (ii) improving access to electricity, (iii) introducing high-voltage distribution systems to \nreduce commercial losses, and (iv) separating feeders between agriculture and households to \nration subsidized power to agriculture and 24-hour power supply to households.

These efforts are largely successful, as shown by the \nsuccess of sector reforms, significant loss reductions, and improved environment for generation \nbusiness.  However,  challenges  remain  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  power  sector.  Distribution \ncompanies are yet to make profits. In particular, the growing demand cannot be met without \nexpanding  and  strengthening  the  T&D  systems.  The  proposed  project  will  help  meet  the \ngrowing demand, make the sector companies financially sustainable, and achieve the long-term \nobjective of GOMP to provide 24-hour power supply to households. The country operations \nbusiness plan for India, 2013\u20132015 includes this project, and it helps in achieving the objectives \nof ADB\u2019s Energy Policy of access to energy for all and capacity building.12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be adequate and reliable power supply in Madhya Pradesh. \nThe outcome will be increased capacity and operational efficiency in the electricity T&D system \nin Madhya Pradesh. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The  project  will  have  three  outputs:  transmission  system  upgraded  and  expanded; \ndistribution system upgraded and expanded; and capacity building for executing agency staff. \nOutput  1  includes  (i)  about  1,800  circuit-km  of  transmission  lines;  (ii)  two  new  and  three \nupgraded  400  kV  substations;  (iii)  four  new  and  five  upgraded  220  kV  substations;  and           \n(iv) 26 new 132 kV substations.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n17.  Madhya Pradesh transmission network is planned and operated based on the planning \ncriteria and operation and monitoring procedures described in the grid code under the oversight \nof  MPERC.  MP  Transco  reviews  the  adequacy  of  the  transmission  network  to  provide \ngeneration connections and to meet the forecast demand at substations, over a period of \n10 years. Load flow studies and short-circuit analyses are then conducted to establish the \nadequacy of the existing transmission network to meet future demand, and to examine the \noperation of proposed improvements to meet demand growth. These improvements and their \ninvestment requirements are documented in the 10-year rolling plan. Improvements consist of \nthe construction of new transmission lines and substations, expansion of the capacity of existing \nsubstations,  and  installation  of  reactive  compensation  equipment  to  improve  network \nperformance. Subprojects to be financed under the project were selected from the 10-year plan, \non the basis of the priority and urgency of such developments, as determined by load flow \nstudies.  The  project  preparatory  team  reviewed  the  load  flow  analyses  conducted  by \nMP Transco\u2019s planning and design division to examine the adequacy, impacts, and technical \nprudence of the project components; and found them to be technically sound. \n \n18.  According to the distribution code approved by MPERC, each distribution company is \nrequired to prepare a 5-year plan for distribution development. This is based on the 5-year \ndemand forecast for the distribution companies\u2019 network and is prepared using the guidelines in \nthe distribution code. The increase in number of households connected to the system and \ngrowing demand among already connected households, commercial, and industrial customers \nare considered in preparing the demand forecast. The target is to meet the service voltages \nstipulated in the distribution code at the lowest investment and operating costs, including the \nlowest possible losses. Subprojects selected to be financed under this project were proposed by \nthe  planning  units  of  the  three  distribution  companies,  and  were  reviewed  by  the  project \npreparatory team to verify that such improvements constitute the lowest cost improvements to \nensure the adequacy and reliability of the distribution network over the next 5 years and beyond. \n ", "7 \nBased on this assessment, the lines and substations proposed were found to be part of the 5-\nyear plan of each distribution company, prepared using prudent planning techniques. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n19.  The project aims to minimize the potential T&D capacity gap of 20% by 2017 to avoid \npossible load shedding. Hence, it contributes to achieving GOMP\u2019s goal of 24-hour power \nsupply to all households. By minimizing the T&D capacity gap, it enables a large number of \nhouseholds  to  improve  their  economic,  commercial,  educational,  and  entertainment \nopportunities. The T&D system improvement of the project will result in energy savings of 878 \nmillion kilowatt-hours per annum. The project will enable an estimated 570,000 households to \nreceive new power connections.15 The project\u2019s technical loss reductions will also result in an \nestimated carbon emission reduction of 684,840 tons per annum. \n \n20.  The economic viability was assessed by incorporating the benefits of technical loss \nreduction  and  the  economic  value  of  incremental  sales  attributed  to  the  project.  Using \nconservative  benefit  assumptions,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  to  be \n21.02%. The sensitivity analysis shows that returns are robust against the main risk factors. The \neconomic  analysis  clearly  establishes  that  the  proposed  investments  generate  benefits  in \nexcess of costs and generate returns at an acceptable rate. \n \n21.  The  financial  viability  assessment  was  undertaken,  considering  reduced  electricity \npurchases arising from the reduction in network losses and additional sales resulting from the \nT&D  system  capacity  enhancement.  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was  calculated \nfollowing ADB guidelines. The financial internal rates of return were estimated for MP Transco \nand the three distribution companies separately, and all exceed the weighted average cost of \ncapital  of  4.0%.  The  project  provided  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  9.3%,  which \ndemonstrates the financial viability of the project. MP Transco is projected to make profits from \nFY2013 onward. However, the current financial position of the three distribution companies is \nnot impressive. None of the distribution companies make profits and their debt situation is not \nhealthy. The business plans of the companies forecast profits after FY2015. Anticipated loss \nreductions resulting from ongoing and proposed investments, and better financial management, \nare expected to result in improvements in the companies\u2019 financial positions. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, GOMP, MP Transco, and the distribution companies. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \nThe financial management  assessment  shows  that  the  executing  agencies  have  adequate \ncapacity  to  manage  the  financial  aspects  of  the  project  implementation.  The  governance \nassessment shows that the procurement, financial management, institutional, and corporate \ngovernance measures introduced in Madhya Pradesh by previous ADB projects are in place \nand functioning.16   \n \n                                                \n15 Project investments increase the transmission and distribution capacity to provide estimated number of new \nconnections. Resources for the new connections are provided by the distribution companies.   \n16 Tariff and Governance Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2)  \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The power sector has significant potential to contribute to economic development and \nsocial well-being, and is both directly and indirectly linked to poverty reduction. Stable electricity \nsupply promotes the agriculture sector and business expansion, and increases employment \nopportunities, which will have positive impacts on poverty reduction. A good quality electricity \nsupply without load shedding is also crucial to meet the basic human needs of health and \neducation. Poor and vulnerable consumers, as well as public utilities such as hospitals and \nschools, are often particularly disadvantaged by an inadequate power supply, load shedding, \nand  poor  power quality,  and  will  therefore  benefit  directly from  the project. The  project  is \nexpected  to  generate  considerable  employment  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during \nconstruction. The executing agencies will be responsible for contractors\u2019 compliance with labor \nstandards, including equal pay for equal work (for men and women), and the provision of \nawareness training on HIV and sexually transmitted diseases and human trafficking, if relevant. \nA  household  survey  conducted  in  Madhya  Pradesh  shows  that  beneficiaries  believe  that \navailability of a 24-hour supply of power will result in children spending more time studying \n(61%),  women  spending  less  time  on  household  tasks  (42%),  the  purchase  of  electrical \nappliances to make life easier (33%), people spending more time on leisure (29%), and people \nsleeping well under a fan (49%).17  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n24.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared  to \naddress environment impacts. No subproject is located within or in the vicinity of  Madhya \nPradesh\u2019s declared forests, cultural and archaeological sites, nine national parks, and 25 wildlife \nsanctuaries. Some subprojects, however, may cause temporary environmental impacts during \nthe construction phase. Adequate mitigation measures for such impacts are included in the \nenvironmental management plan of MP Transco and distribution companies, with adequate \nfunds.  These  plans  were  incorporated  in  the  project\u2019s  bid  documents.  An  environmental \nmonitoring  plan  was  also  prepared.  The  project\u2019s  capacity  building  component  includes \nsafeguard  training  for  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination was disclosed on the ADB website and a project brief in Hindi will be prepared by \nMP Transco, DISCOM-C, DISCOM-E, and DISCOM-W and will be made available to the public \nat their field offices. \n \n25.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The construction of transmission lines will not \nrequire  the  acquisition  of  private  property.  However,  temporary  impacts  will  affect  crops \ncultivated and people\u2019s livelihood sources. Effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and \ncompensate  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  the  approved  resettlement  plan.  The \ninstitutional capacity and commitment of the executing and implementing agencies to manage \nthe  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  risks  are  deemed  adequate.  During  project \nimplementation, if any additional involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, the executing \nagencies will design and integrate sound mitigation measures into the resettlement plan and \nsubmit to ADB for review and approval. The resettlement plan was disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite.  \n \n26.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Social  assessments  conducted  during  project \npreparation found no indigenous peoples who would be impacted by project activities. If any \n                                                \n17 H.
