The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nsupported public sector reforms under the Public Sector Reform\nProgram (PSRP) loan in 1997. Additional reform initiatives are\nrequired to consolidate the gains of the PSRP. The Government\nis moving on a number of fronts to achieve an economy less\ndependent on external flows in an environment that promotes\ngood governance, strengthen the financial sector for growth,\nand improve the policy environment for the private sector. The\nGovernment  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  support  for  its  reform\ninitiatives  to  undertake  far-reaching  and  necessary  changes\nrequired  to  ensure  long-term  self-reliance,  improve  public\nfinancial  management,  overcome  current  financial  difficulties,\nimprove the environment for the private sector, and meet the\nadjustment cost of the Program.\nObjectives and Scope The key objectives of the Program loans are to (i) ensure a\nsustainable income flow for future generations, (ii) strengthen\npublic sector financial and economic management, (iii) stabilize\nthe fiscal position, (iv) enhance the policy environment for the\nprivate sector, and (v) improve the effectiveness of the public\nservice.\nClassification Primary: Sustainable economic growth\nThematic: Good governance\nEnvironmental  Category B\nAssessment\nADB Loan\nLoans Amount ADB will provide a loan of $4,000,000 from its ordinary capital\nand Terms resources (OCR) and a loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSDR 6,320,000 from its Special Funds (SF) resources ($8.0\nmillion equivalent). The OCR loan will have a maturity of 15\nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  with  interest\ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable\nlending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans  and  a  commitment\ncharge of 0.75 percent per annum. The SF loan will have a\nrepayment period of 24 years including a grace period of 8\nyears and a 1 percent interest charge during the grace period,\nand 1.5 percent thereafter.", "iii\nProgram Period The Program period is from June 2001 until May 2004. The\nand Tranching loans funds will be released in three tranches. The first tranche\nof $4.3 million equivalent ($2 million OCR and $2.3 million SF)\nwill  be  made  available  after  loan  effectiveness  and  upon\ncompliance with first tranche conditions; the second tranche of\n$5.4 million equivalent ($1.5 million OCR and $3.9 million SF)\nwill  be  released  upon  compliance  with  second  tranche\nconditions; and the remaining balance of $2.3 million equivalent\n($.05 million OCR and $1.8 million SF) will be released upon\ncompliance with third tranche conditions.\nExecuting Agency The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the\nloan  and  will  have  overall  responsibility  to  implement  the\nProgram.\nProcurement The proceeds of the loans will be disbursed against a broad\nrange  of  imports,  except  for  a  negative  list  of  items.  The\nproceeds  of  the  loans  will  only  be  used  to  financed  items\nproduced and procured in ADB member countries except the\nineligible items specified in a negative list. Procurement under\nthe loans will follow normal commercial practice by the private\nsector, or standard Government procedures for procurement by\nthe public sector, except that goods commonly traded on the\ninternational commodity market will be procured in accordance\nwith procedure appropriate to the trade.\nCounterpart Funds Counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the\nloans  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  costs  associated  with\nimplementation  of  the  Fiscal  and  Financial  Management\nProgram.\nTechnical Assistance Technical assistance in an amount equivalent to $950,000 for (i)\nfiscal  and  financial  advisory  services,  (ii)  economic  strategy\nadvice,  and  (iii)  building  capacity  for  a  more  efficient  public\nservice is proposed together with the Program loan. TA closing\ndate will be co-terminus with loan closing in May 2004.\nRisks The  Program  has  identified  four  major  risks:  (i)  inadequate\npolitical  commitment  over  the  next  15  years,  (ii)  national\ncapacity  constraints,  (iii)  resource  constraints  arising  from\ndramatic cuts in Compact funding, and (iv) less-than-expected\nfinancial returns from the MIITF. While these will remain risks,\nthe Program proposes mitigating measures to manage the risks\nand minimize the impact on the country\u2019s economic stabilization\nand self-reliance initiatives.", "MAP", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on proposed loans\nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for the Fiscal and Financial Management Program.\nThe Report also describes proposed technical assistance to provide economic, financial, and\neconomic advisory services and specialist inputs, and if the proposed loans are approved by the\nBoard, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the technical\nassistance.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The RMI consists of over 1,000 small islands having a total land area of only 181 square\nkilometers  (km2)  dispersed  over  2  million  km2  of  ocean.  The  population  of  about  53,000,\ncurrently growing at an estimated rate of 1.5 percent per annum, is concentrated in two main\nurban centers, Majuro and Ebeye. Like several of the smaller Pacific countries, the RMI is\nremote from major markets, deficient in both the quality and quantity of land resources, and\nacutely short of skilled labor, although it does possess potentially rich marine resources built on\nfish and seabed minerals. The RMI has a dual economy, with a subsistence sector coexisting\nwith a modern urban cash economy. It has limited productive potential, particularly in terms of\nagricultural potential, while land-based investment opportunities are further constrained by a\ntraditional land tenure system that complicates or precludes secure access to land.\n3. After World War II, the United Nations (UN) established the Trust Territory of the Pacific\nIslands (TTPI), comprising the Marshall Islands, as well as the Caroline Islands (now the FSM)\nand the Northern Mariana Islands, to be administered by the United States (US). The Marshall\nIslands became a republic in May 1979, following the approval of a constitution through a\nnational  referendum.  In  1982,  the  US  and  RMI  signed  a  Compact  of  Free  Association\n(Compact). The Compact came into effect in 1986 when the UN Trusteeship was terminated.\nThe national constitution of 1979 provides for a parliamentary system with legislative, executive,\nand judiciary branches. The political structure is a blend of the American and British systems of\nGovernment.  Legislative  power  is  vested  in  the  House  of  Representatives,  the  Nitijela.  In\naddition, the traditional Council of Chiefs, or lroij, acts as a consultative body that may request\nreconsideration of any bill affecting customary law, particularly as it relates to land tenure.\n4. During the Trust period, the US was given permission to use the TTPI for military\npurposes. A naval base was established on Kwajalein atoll, which was later developed as a\nmissile test site as part of a US global system for interballistic missiles. Since 1947, the base\nhas provided employment for 300-800 Marshallese who received wage equivalent to those paid\nin the US. In the period up to 1986, a small cadre of Marshallese was educated and employed\nin Majuro, again at wages equivalent to those in the US.\n5. Since the Compact became effective in 1986, the RMI has been receiving considerable\neconomic and technical assistance from the US. While containing specific provisions on the\nrelations between the two Governments in areas such as foreign affairs, immigration, defense,\nand environmental protection, the Compact revolves principally around (i) economic assistance,\nboth grant and program assistance, with a number of provisions regarding trade and taxation;\nand  (ii)  compensatory  payments,  associated  with  research,  medical,  and  agricultural/food\nprograms, for the use of the RMI's territory for nuclear tests carried out in the 1940s and 1950s\nin the four atolls of Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik, and for continuing US military\noperations on Kwajalein atoll. Total Compact payments have been declining from 70 percent of\ngross domestic product (GDP) in the late 1980s to below 50 percent at present. However,", "2\nCompact funding is the lynchpin of the economy and effective utilization of these funds remains\na key policy issue in the country.\nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA.  Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n6. Over the last 15 years, the RMI economy has been largely stagnant. The overall GDP (in\n1991 prices) increased by about 17 percent from $53.4 million in 1986 to $62.6 million in 1999.\nThis was, however, not enough to counterbalance the growth rate of population which, despite a\nlarge migration to the US, increased by 34 percent over this period. As a result, there was a\nsignificant decline in per capita income in the country, from $1,404 (in 1991 constant prices) in\n1986 to $1,230 in 1999, a decline of about 12 percent (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per Capita\n(1991 Prices)\n1800\n1600\n1400\na\nt\npi 1200\na\nc 1000\ner $)\nP( 800\nP \n600\nD\nG\n400\n200\n0\n1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999\nYear\nSource: RMI Office of Planning and Statistics\n7. Agriculture and fisheries have traditionally been the mainstay of the economy. But in\n1999, the share of agriculture and livestock in GDP was only 4.5 percent, lower than in 1995\n(6.7 percent). Production of copra, the main cash crop, declined from 6,815 metric tons (t) in\n1986 to 3,348 t in 1999. With an exclusive economic zone of over 2 million km2, fisheries is\nconsidered as the sector with potential for generating economic growth. Fishing accounted for\n7.4 percent of GDP in 1999, but a large part of the income was from royalties from fishing done\nby foreign companies in Marshallese waters. The total fish catch by Japanese and other foreign\nfishing vessels has been declining, from 12,993 t in 1989 to 2,457 t in 1999.\n8. Manufacturing is virtually nonexistent. Processing of copra products runs at a loss and\nhas a negative value-added of 0.2 percent of GDP in 1999. Other manufactured products and\nhandicrafts were only 1.9 percent of GDP in 1999, lower than in 1995 (2.5 percent). While a\ntourist sector is beginning and has potential for income generation, it is still limited.\n9. Electricity, gas and water, and construction are the only part of the goods-producing\nsector that forms a sizable portion of GDP and has been growing at least slightly (from 12.2\npercent of GDP in 1995 to 13.25 percent in 1999).", "3\n10. The service sector is the dominant part of the economy, accounting for 71.4 percent of\nGDP in 1999, marginally up from 69.9 percent in 1995. Public administration generates nearly 5\ntimes  as  much  income  as  agriculture.  The  service  sector  depends  on  the  public  sector\nexpenditures, which in turn depend largely on external flows. This underlines the important fact\nthat external flows are vital for the Marshallese economy; without these flows in one form or\nanother, the economy in its present form would collapse.\n11. Despite decline in per capita incomes, there has been a marked improvement in the\nhealth status in the country over the last 15 years. Infant and child death rates have been\nconsiderably reduced: infant deaths from 63 to 37 per 1,000 live births and mortality rates of\nunder 5 from 93 to 48 per 1,000 live births. Life expectancy has increased from 61 in 1988 to 67\nin 1999. Family planning is also making progress and the total fertility rate has declined from a\nvery high level of 7.2 in 1988 to 5.7 in 1998. However, informal safety-nets are beginning to fail,\nfamily structures are breaking down, and there is evidence of hunger, child neglect,1 and other\nsymptoms of emerging poverty.\n12. There has been progress in education too. The 1999 census reported that as much as\n97 percent of the household population of 10 years and older were literate (able  to read and\nwrite a simple message in any language). Access to elementary and secondary education also\nincreased significantly during the last 10 years. School-age children enrolled in elementary\nschools increased from 82 percent in 1988 to 84 percent in 1999 and those in secondary\nschools from 47 percent in 1988 to 69 percent in 1999. The performance of schools and training\ninstitutions  in  RMI  is,  however,  poor.  The  output  standards  are  below  regional  parity.  A\nsignificant number of students are leaving school ill equipped for a productive life, and low skill\nlevels in the labor force deter investment. Major education issues are poor quality of public\neducation, especially on the outer islands, and the relevance of school curricula to the workforce\nrealities in the Marshall Islands.\n13. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) ranks the Marshall Islands 8th out\nof 12 Pacific Islands developing countries on both its human development and poverty indices.\nThis lower ranking status reflects the UNDP assessment that one of four of the population is\nilliterate, almost one child in five is underweight, and almost one household in five does not\nhave  access  to  safe  water.  The  country  faces  formidable  challenges  in  the  form  of\nenvironmental  degradation,  accelerated  sea-level  rise,  the  legacy  of  nuclear  testing,  and\nlocalized pollution in several overcrowded islands.\n14. Due to relatively easy migration rules to the US, a significant number of Marshallese\nhave been emigrating to the US and the actual growth rate of population during 1988-1999 was\nonly 1.5 percent per year (while the natural rate of increase of population was 3.5 percent per\nyear) and that of the labor force only 2.4 percent per year. However, employment generation in\nthe country over the last 15 years was negligible and employment in the monetized sector in\nfact declined by about 10 percent during 1988-1999. As a result, unemployment increased from\n12.5 percent in 1988 to 30.9 percent in 1999. It is 73.3 percent in the age group 15-19 and 56.6\npercent in the age group 20-24.\n15. This unemployment situation may constitute a veritable social time bomb in the country.\n                  \n1 Development in the 1990s of a brisk market in overseas (mostly US) adoption of Marshallese children\u2014and the\npromotional role of law firms acting as go-betweens\u2014was a clear sign of growing malaise, especially among the\nurban unemployed.", "4\nAs has happened in many other developing countries, such high unemployment can become a\nsource of social problems, including the breakdown of law and order. So far the RMI has had a\nrelatively good record on law and order, but its continuance cannot be taken for granted if the\nunemployment situation continues to worsen. To avoid such eventuality, the Government must\nurgently consider ways of increasing employment. Even if the growth of the labor force could be\nslowed down to 1.5 percent per year (from the current 2.4 percent), there would be a need to\ncreate employment for about 10,000 workers between 1999 and 2020, or roughly 500 jobs per\nyear.\nTable 1: The Emerging Unemployment Problem in the RMI\nItem 1980 1988 1999\nA.

A related development issue is labor productivity and sustainability of wage rates. A\nminimum wage rate of $1.5/hour was established in 1986 and was increased to $2/hour in\nJanuary 1995. The Government as the single largest employer maintains this standard, while in\nthe private sector many smaller businesses reportedly pay less than the minimum wage. The\nGovernment generally pays higher rates than the private sector for nominally equivalent jobs.\nOutput per person, on the other hand, appears significantly higher in the private sector. This is\ngenerally believed to result largely from the greater autonomy enjoyed by managers in the\nprivate sector in motivating, disciplining, and rewarding employees, free from political pressure\nand unhindered by the notion that permanent employment is a right. By regional standards,  the\nRMI\u2019s public service pay rates are high, 2-3 times higher than the rates prevailing across most\nSouth Pacific island countries, and many times higher than in Southeast Asian countries. The\nflow-on  effect  to  private  sector  wage  rates  and  high  operating  costs,  combined  with  the\ncontinued  strength  of  the  US  dollar,  hurts  the  RMI\u2019s  competitiveness  as  a  tourism  and\ninvestment destination.\nB.  Development Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n17. The inflow of money from the Compact led to major disequilibria in the RMI economy. It\nlessened pressure for fiscal balance, and encouraged imports and discouraged development of\nnew exports. Support for wage levels that were not in line with levels of productivity kept costs\nof production higher than they otherwise would be, and worked against the development of new\nproductive activities. These negative factors were aggravated by the Government\u2019s practice of\nborrowing against future Compact receipts. Part of this money has been invested in projects of\ndoubtful quality and with low or negative returns, while an important part has been used to\nfinance budget deficits.", "5\n18. A report2 by the US General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewing the effectiveness of\nCompact funds in promoting \u201ceconomic self-sufficiency\u201d of the country came out with some\nsobering conclusions about the quality of development performance in the country. After an\nextensive review of the programs and projects financed through Compact funds, it concluded:\n\u201cCompact expenditures to date have led to little improvement in economic development\nin the RMI. Per capita incomes, when adjusted for inflation, have fallen in the RMI since\nthe beginning of the Compact. Compact funds spent to support general government\noperations  have  maintained  high  government  wages  and  a  large  level  of  public\nemployment that has discouraged private sector growth. Compact spending to create\nand improve infrastructure has not directly contributed to significant economic growth. In\naddition, Compact funded business ventures have generally failed. Money has been\nwasted, because the authorities did not conduct cost-benefit or feasibility analyses or\nplan  for  local  environmental  conditions  or  maintenance  needs  and  were  not  held\naccountable for the effective use of funds. The persistent problems we found in project\nplanning, implementation, and monitoring demonstrate a lack of adequate skills and\nexperience in managing projects and large budget funds.\u201d\n19. The Government of the RMI has been attempting structural adjustments to stimulate\neconomic development and contain budgetary deficit for over half a decade. Under the Public\nSector Reform Program (PSRP) loan from ADB in 1997, the Government moved on a number\nof fronts, including improving the policy environment for the private sector, strengthening the\nfinancial  sector  for  growth,  and  achieving  an  economy  less  dependent  on  external  flows.\nHowever, with the death of President Amata Kabua, the main champion of reforms, there were\nsome slippages. The new Government which took office in January 2000 is reform-oriented and\nbelieves that follow-up actions as well as additional reform initiatives are required. Recent\nactions  taken  including  meeting  targets  on  staff  reduction  under  PSRP  as  well  as  other\nanticorruption and good governance measures initiated by the Government lend credence to\nthis commitment.\n20. The current leadership in the country wants to ensure that serious efforts are made to\nchange the past attitudes and devise a new political consensus for economic self-sufficiency. In\nan interview with Universal News in Majuro 20 January 2000, President Kessai Note put the\nproblem in the following terms:\n\u201cOne of the most important tasks facing all of us in the RMI is to work together to make\nthe Marshall Islands more self-reliant to the extent possible. For many years we have\nbeen trained to depend on other countries to provide for our daily basic needs. It is an\nage-old attitude that needs to be changed.\nThe US has been generous in the past. However, we both realize that at the end of the\n15-year period, the financial assistance provided was not sufficient to make the Marshall\nIslands a self-supporting country, which was the primary aim of the Compact when we\nstarted it. The economic assistance provided under the Compact has come and gone\nwithout much change to the level of economic development in the Marshall Islands.\u201d\n21. It is this clear recognition of the failures of the past and a determination to reverse the\npast trends that provide the setting to the new development strategy that the Government is in\n                  \n2 U.S. General Accounting Office. September, 2000. Foreign Assistance: US Funds to Micronesian Nations Had\nLittle Impact on Economic Development.  Washington, D.C.", "6\nthe process of adopting. The Government requested ADB in August 2000 for a follow-up\nprogram  loan  for  fiscal  and  financial  sector  reforms:  to  undertake  economic  and  financial\nplanning to implement strategies for long-term financial stability, establish a national trust fund\nto ensure sustainable financing of the budget and social development activities over the longer\nterm, stabilize its immediate financial position, and continue further reforms in the financial and\nfiscal sectors.\n22. The economic provisions under the Compact between the US and the RMI will be\nexpiring in 2001. Until a new Compact is negotiated, the RMI\u2019s economy will be in transition.\nADB assistance has been considered essential to help the RMI lay the groundwork for future\ndevelopment and, in particular, take the economy through this transition period expected to last\nfor another 2-3 years until the renegotiated economic provisions of the Compact come into\neffect. As elaborated in the development policy letter from the President of the RMI (see\nAppendix 1) and in section V, the Program is designed to achieve sustainable pro-poor growth\nwithout continued reliance on external assistance. It is also designed to achieve greater equity\nand improved quality of life of the people which, in the Pacific context, represents a major\npoverty reduction initiative.\nIV.  PUBLIC SECTOR AND FISCAL ISSUES\nA.  Public Sector\n23. The public sector is overwhelmingly dominant in the RMI economy. The national and\nlocal governments not only provide an important share of formal employment in the economy,\nbut also own and control a large number of corporations and statutory bodies. While many\nGovernment  holdings  have  been  corporatized  over  the  years,  and  subsidies  successfully\nreduced or eliminated in many cases, public sector dominance of the economy remains.\n24. Public administration consists of the national civil service under the responsibility of the\nPublic Service Commission, the Marshall Islands Development Authority (MIDA), the Kwajalein\nAtoll Development Authority (KADA), and 24 local governments. MIDA was established in 1984\nas  the  authority  to  investigate,  develop,  and  implement  social  and  economic  development\nprograms and projects. It was created to coordinate Government actions to the development of\npublic and private businesses and as such, is regarded as the business arm of the Government.\nThe funding source has always been the capital account of Section 211 of the Compact. These\nfunds are now used mainly for debt servicing and MIDA has lost much of its importance. The\nKADA was set up in 1985 to plan and implement development activities on Kwajalein Atoll, with\na view to improving living conditions in Ebeye.\n25. The TTPI administration left the RMI with a large, costly, and poorly performing public\nservice,  a  condition  that  continued  after  independence.  In  1994  a  Presidential  Committee\nlooking at public sector reform concluded that the service was overstaffed and inefficient, had\nmany  unproductive  employees,  lacked  skilled  staff,  and  showed  widespread  duplication.\nReforms over the past four years have had a major impact, but further improvements are\nneeded.\nB.  Civil Service\n26. The  Constitution  assigns  responsibility  for  the  public  service  to  the  Public  Service\nCommission (PSC). The PSC is the employing authority of the public service, charged with its\norganization, management, efficiency, and economy of the service. Under the Constitution, PSC", "7\nmembers have security of tenure similar to High Court judges, and the PSC is required to act\nindependently, not under direction from the Cabinet or anyone else.\n27. The  Constitution  states  that  the  PSC  should  take  into  account  \u201cthe  need  to  afford\nreasonable employment opportunities for employment of citizens\u2026\u201d and should act \u201cconsistently\nwith government economic and social policy, bearing in mind that the conditions of employment\nin the public service are a major element in the well-being of the Marshall Islands.\u201d This\nrequirement, effectively in force well before independence, reflects the role of government\nemployment in widely distributing US-provided income within the RMI community.\n28. Until 1996, the RMI civil service grew in size and complexity, supported by Compact\npayments. For many years, growth in the civil service aroused some concern but little action.\nWhile funds were available to cover the growing number of civil servants, there was little\napparent need for restraint. The total personnel in the public service increased from 1,751\nworkers in 1988 to a high point of 2,303 by 1995. At that time there were 10 ministries; the\nMinistry of Education was the largest with 733 employees and the Ministry of Health and\nEnvironment had 411 employees (Table 2).\n29. By 1995 it was realized that the public service could not continue to expand. This\nrealization was triggered by the fiscal crisis caused by Compact revenues drying up and by the\nfailure of government\u2019s investments from borrowings to yield expected returns. The payroll\nbecame increasingly difficult to fund and the Government was forced to address the size and\ncost of the civil service. The Public Sector Management Improvement Program approved by the\nNitijela as part of the PSRP recommended wide-ranging cuts. The Program was successful in\nreducing the size of the public service, but was less successful in raising the efficiency levels.\n30. With the implementation of the reduction-in-force (RIF) program, the public service was\nreduced by more than a third to 1,484 in July 2000. Table 2 shows how this reduction was\nachieved and which areas were affected most. The reductions fell unevenly across the service.\nThe social service departments took longer to achieve the proposed cuts as ministries tried to\nwork out how to cope with the staff reductions while maintaining services. In the end, education\nand police services achieved fewer cuts, while health numbers eventually fell below initially\nanticipated levels. The notable exception to this was the elimination of the Ministry of Social\nServices, which involved eliminating the school feeding program in 1996 and retrenching almost\n200 employees. The remaining services from this department were transferred to the Ministry of\nInternal Affairs and Social Welfare.", "8\nTable 2: Staff Numbers by Agency, 1995-2000\nNitijela Actual % Change\nMinistry/Unit October 1995 Recommended July Oct 95-\nCeiling 2000 Jul 2000\n Auditor General   7  5  7\n Cabinet   13  8  8 -38\n Chief Secretary's Office   24  19  22 -8\n Council of Iroij   4  2  3 -25\n Education   733  630  667 -9\n Finance   61  52  35 -43\n Foreign Affairs   39  32  28 -28\n Health and Environment   411  351  343 -17\n Environmental Protection Authority 11  11  9 -18\n Internal Affairs (& Social Welfare)  32  39  49 +53\n Justice  160  139  161 +1\nMarshall Islands Marine Resources  36  31  - -100\n     Authority (MIMRA)\n Nitijela  21  18  10 -52\n Planning & Statistics  11  9  6 -45\n Public Service Commission (PSC)  10  8  4 -60\n Resources & Development/Public  180  72  66 -63\n Social Services  223 -100\n Transport & Communication  6  16 +167\n Transport & Communication Shipping  77 -100\n     Operations\n Transport & Communication Airport  11  4 -64\n     Operations\n Public Defender  7  5  4 -43\n Marshall Islands Development Authority  3  2  2 -33\n Judiciary Courts  20  17  15 -25\n Postal Services  15  13  12 -20\n Attorney-General  10  8  11 +10\n Regulatory Authority  13\n Others  2\n Vacancies  178 -100\n  Total  2,303  1,484  1,484 -36\nSource: Ministry of Finance payroll.\n31. The other departments that achieved large reductions were those interfacing with the\nprivate sector or involved in providing services that could be supplied by the private sector. The\nMinistry of Public Works, the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and the Ministry of\nResources and Development were all hard hit by the staff cuts. In part, this reflected the\nGovernment recognition that the government\u2019s role was spread too widely and too thinly to be\neffective. One of the achievements of the RIF is that it made the Government focus on those\nservices that are important to maintaining its \u201csocial contract\u201d with the people, and in so doing\ncleared  the  way  for  the  private  sector  to  move  into  areas  previously  occupied  by  the\nGovernment. However, the proposition that the private sector will necessarily be a better service\nprovider, particularly where the circumstances make commercial competition unlikely, is not yet\nproven.\n32. The leading case is interisland shipping. With public service withdrawal from providing\nshipping services, maintenance, and public works, a number of outer islands are suffering", "9\nbecause of hitches in implementing the privately run domestic shipping service. Public works is\nanother  problem  area.  The  department  was  largely  dismantled  under  the  RIF  as  many\nconstruction and maintenance jobs were contracted to the private sector, but the Government\nlacks civil engineering and public works expertise in-house to specify and supervise contracted\nwork. These problems stem not from the inability of the private sector to cope with the work but\nwith the capacity of the public service and the need for the service to recognize its changing\nrole.\nC.  Fiscal Development and External Position\n33. Disciplined  fiscal  management  is  a  key  element  in  the  sound  development  of  the\neconomy. Recent budgetary operations summarized in Table 3 show that despite the public\nsector reform program launched in the mid-1990s, improvement in the RMI\u2019s budgetary situation\nhas not been sustained. Current expenditures have declined from $53.8 million in FY1996 to\n$50.1 in FY2000; but that was largely due to lower interest payments as the large borrowings of\nthe past were being paid off. Current expenditures minus interest payments actually increased\nfrom  $46.3  in  FY1996  to  $48.2  million  in  FY2000.  Payments  against  wages  and  salaries\ndeclined from $21.4 million in FY1996 to $17.3 million in FY2000 and subsidies to public\nenterprises from $2.6 million to $1.5 million. However, \u201cother subsidies and transfers\u201d have\nincreased  from  $4.7  million  in  FY1996  to  $10.3  million  in  FY2000,  which  more  than\ncompensated for decline in wages and salaries and in subsidies to public enterprises. Taxes as\na percentage of current expenditures declined from 36 percent to 32 percent over this period\nand all revenues as percentage of GDP from 37 percent to 23 percent. The current deficit is\nestimated to be $11.8 million in FY2000, which will be 12.3 percent of GDP, significantly higher\nthan the level in FY1997 when the PSRP was launched.\n34. During FY1999 and FY2000, the Government utilized about $23 million of its financial\nassets and by the end of FY2000, the usable government financial assets were reduced to $0.2\nmillion, the lowest ever in recent history.\n35. The main area of improvement is government debt, which declined from $127.7 million\nin FY1995 to $60.5 million in FY2000. These debts are expected to be substantially paid off by\nFY2001 and this will save the country debt service payment of about $20.0 million per year. The\nfuture  strength  of  government  finances  and  the  income  security  of  future  generations  will\ndepend on how wisely these savings are utilized in the future.\n36. The balance of payments account in the RMI is very much a reflection of the government\naccounts. The imports of goods and nonfactor services in FY1999/2000 were estimated to be\n$69.3 million, about 71 percent of GDP, whereas exports of goods and nonfactor services were\nonly $14.9 million, about 15 percent of GDP. The deficit was more than fully met by factor\nincomes and unrequited transfers (including Compact payments), which were $61.7 million in\nFY1999/2000. The current account surplus of $7.3 million was not, however, sufficient to meet\nthe net outflow on capital account of $14.7 million, the result was a drawdown of the financial\nholdings of the national and local governments. The emerging problems on the balance of\npayments account are a mirror image of the government\u2019s budgetary position reviewed above.", "10\nTable 3 : Central Government Finances, FY1991-FY2001\n($ million)\nItem FY1995 FY1996 FY1997 FY1998 FY1999 FY2000 FY2000 FY2001\nBudget est Budget\nTotal revenue and grants 77.7 78.1 68.8 71.5 65.5 62.1 62.1 68.8\n Total domestic revenue 34.9 36.0 27.8 24.7 26.7 22.6 22.5 24.6\n Taxes 19.5 19.4 18.6 18.7 16.9 15.8 16.1 16.9\n Income 9.3 8.5 8.1 7.6 7.6 7.5 8.0 8.5\n Gross revenue 3.1 3.9 2.7 2.7 2.5 3.0 3.1 3.2\n Imports 6.3 5.7 7.0 7.5 6.2 5.0 3.9 4.8\n Other 0.9 1.3 0.8 0.8 0.5 0.3 1.1 0.3\n Nontax 15.4 16.6 9.2 6.0 9.8 6.8 6.4 7.7\n Fishing rights 2.2 1.6 1.9 1.3 2.3 3.0 3.4 4.4\n Fees and charges 2.0 2.8 1.9 0.6 0.6 0.3 0.5 0.3\n Investment income 6.2 1.1 0.8 1.6 0.6 0.6 0.3 0.3\n Other 5.1 11.2 4.6 2.4 6.3 2.9 2.2 2.8\n Grants 42.8 42.1 41.0 46.8 38.8 39.6 39.6 44.1\nOf which: current grants 19.4 14.1 18.0 22.9 15.8 15.8 15.8 15.8\n Compact 36.4 34.6 30.4 30.9 30.9 30.9 30.9 30.9\n Other 6.4 7.5 10.6 15.9 7.9 8.7 8.7 13.2\nTotal expenditure 109.8 60.1 60.4 56.6 55.3 53.8 57.1 53.8\n Current expenditure 66.8 53.8 52.9 51.8 48.4 46.8 50.1 44.1\n Wages and salaries 21.9 21.4 18.8 18.0 17.0 17.1 17.3 17.5\n Goods and services 18.0 17.5 17.8 21.6 18.8 18.8 19.0 19.1\n Interest payments 7.5 7.5 6.8 5.4 4.3 2.3 1.9 0.9\nSubsidies to public enterprises 6.0 2.6- 2.1 2.6 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.5\n Other subsidies and transfers 3.7 4.7 5.4 3.6 6.1 7.0 10.3 4.9\n RIF paymenta 0.0 0.0 2.1 0.6 0.8 0.1 0.1 0.1\n Capital expenditure 43.0 6.4 7.5 4.8 6.9 7.0 7.0 9.7\nCurrent balance -12.4 -3.7 -7.1 -4.2 -5.9 -8.4 -11.8 -3.6\nOverall balance -32.1 17.9 8.4 14.9 10.2 8.4 5.1 15.0\nFinancing\nNet government borrowing -12.2 -12.4 -7.3 -11.0 -27.9 -13.4 -11.6 -16.0\nGross borrowing 4.1 4.1 10.7 7.9 15.0 5.3 7.1 9.0\nPrincipal repayment 16.2 16.5 17.9 19.0 42.8 18.7 18.7 25.0\nAsset sales 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 1.3 2.5\nUse of government financial 44.3 -5.6 -3.8 17.7 0.1 5.3 -1.6\nassets\n(percent of GDP)\nRevenue and grants 80.5 74.6 74.7 67.3 64.7 64.7 69.6\n Revenue 33.2 37.1 30.2 25.8 27.4 23.5 23.4 24.9\n Grants 40.7 43.4 44.5 48.9 39.9 41.2 41.3 44.7\nExpenditure 104.4 62.0 65.5 59.2 56.8 56.0 59.5 54.4\n Current 63.5 55.4 57.4 54.2 49.7 48.7 52.2 44.6\n Capital 40.9 6.6 8.1 5.0 7.1 7.3 7.3 9.8\nCurrent balance -11.8 -3.8 -7.8 -4.4 -6.1 -8.8 -12.3 -3.7\nOverall balance -30.5 18.5 9.1 15.5 10.5 8.7 5.3 15.2\n($ million)\nMemorandum items:\nGovernment fund balance 30.0 41.5 42.5 47.0 29.3 29.2 23.9 25.5\nUsable government financial 18.2 9.9 9.3 12.4 4.8 4.7 0.2 1.8\nassetsb\nOutstanding government debt 127.7 115.3 108.1 97.0 70.1 58.7 60.5 44.5\nStock of arrears 1.6 1.4 0.9 1.2 1.0 0.9 1.7 1.7\na Early retirement and separation program (reduction in force) financed by an ADB loan.\nb Cash and cash equivalents that are not reserved for specific uses.\nSource: Ministry of Finance, RMI, and IMF.", "11\nD.  Government Expenditure\n1.  The Short-Term Budgetary Crunch\n37. The long-term development debacle in the country has been compounded by a short-\nterm budgetary crunch, which threatens to disrupt the normal operations of the government.\n\u201cUsable government financial assets\u201d in Table 3 which show cash and cash equivalents that are\nnot reserved for specific uses, declined from $12.4 million in FY1998 to virtually zero at the end\nof FY2000. As a result, the government is encountering serious difficulties in meeting its payroll,\nreplenishing needed supplies (hospitals have no supply of basic medicine for the last three\nmonths) and funding education expenses. The Government is considering suspension of copra\nbuying as there is no money to pay subsidies or even process copra for inventory. This will spell\ndisaster for the outer island economies, which depend largely on copra income. A significant\nincrease in poverty and hardship is likely.\n38. It is important to note that the \u201coverall balance\u201d in Table 3 is not a good indicator of the\nresource position of the country. For example, for FY2000 the estimated surplus in overall\nbalance of $5.3 million is more than fully offset by net outflow on debt of $11.6 million. The\ndeficit of $6.3 million had to be covered by sale of assets and, more importantly, by drawing\ndown on financial balances resulting in near exhaustion of transaction balances.\n2.  Causes of the Budgetary Crunch\n39. This sudden depletion of government financial balances is due to some unanticipated\nexternal  shocks  and  not  to  Government  profligacy.  The  main  factors  contributing  to  the\nbudgetary crunch are noted below.\na.  Cuts in Import Duty\n 40. Prior to the national elections in early 1999, the previous Government reduced the basic\nimport duty rate from 12 percent to 5 percent of import values. It put RMI import duties below\nthe regional levels. Due to the less than fully competitive situation among importers, the benefits\nof the duty cuts were not fully passed on to consumers. It did not bring about quantitative growth\nin imports. The Government lost revenues to the tune of $3 million during FY2000 and about $1\nmillion in the first four months of FY2001.\nb.  Health Costs\n41. Over the years, the cost of referrals in health services was paid to US companies on the\nbasis of 360 days payment period. Starting in 2000, there was a change in the method of\npayments to these service providers and the payment period was reduced to 30 days. Since the\nRMI relies heavily on service providers in the US, this change resulted in large additional\npayments by the Government in FY2000 and FY2001. As shown in Table 4, the Government\nhad to pay an additional $2.7 million in subsidies to the health fund; even then the fund had a\ndeficit  of  $1.1  million  in  FY2000.  For  FY2001,  unless  the  Government  provides  additional\nsubsidy, the deficits of the fund will amount to $3.65 million.\n42. The poor management of the medical referral system has led to an accumulated claim\non the Government\u2019s general fund by Marshall Islands Social Security Administration (MISSA)\nof about $3.7 million for deferred payments. This is the result of poor coordination between the\nMinistry of Health and Environment, which approves referrals, and MISSA, which acts as the", "12\npaying agent. This burden of deferred payments continues without the necessary revenues to\ncover costs. This was compounded by the recent reduction of employers\u2019 and employees\u2019\nhealth fund contributions from 3.5 percent to 2.5 percent. The situation is aggravated by the\ninadequate on-island health care that necessitates sending people overseas even for minor\nmedical  problems.  The  rate  at  which  this  liability  grows  is  increasing  and  jeopardizes  the\nGovernment\u2019s already desperate fiscal position and the delivery of health services.\nTable 4: Basic Health Fund\n($ million)\nItem FY1997 FY1998 FY1999 FY2000 FY2001\n(est.)\nA.

Undelivered Funds from Asset Sales\n43. In the budget for FY2000, a provision was made for receipt of $5 million from the sale of\nan aircraft by Air Marshall Islands (AMI). The sale was made and AMI received the payment of\n$5 million. However, the management of AMI claimed that it was short of funds for urgent\nmaintenance work and returned only $1.75 million to the Government\u2019s budget. The issue is\nunder consideration by the board of AMI. In the meantime, the Government is faced with a\nliquidity problem.\nd.  Copra Subsidy\n44. The government-owned copra processing authority is heavily subsidized through the\ngovernment\u2019s budget. Copra is bought at an artificially high price with the Government meeting\nthe difference between commercial price and the supported price. This subsidy is used to inject\ncash  into  the  mainly  subsistence  outer-island  economies.  The  action  of  the  previous\nGovernment to raise the buying price to 15 cents/lb (6.8 cents/kg) prior to the 1999 election was\nseen as politically motivated. The increase in price had little impact on the Government\u2019s fiscal\nposition  at  that  time  because  of  the  lack  of  inter-island  shipping  services.  With  recent\nimprovements in shipping services, the impact on the Government\u2019s budget has been severe.\nEven though the price has been cut from 15 cents/lb to 9 cents/lb (4.1 cents/kg), the total\nsubsidy in FY2001 is expected to reach $2.0 million, more than double what was originally\nbudgeted.\nE.  Government Objectives and Strategy\n45. The Government has been requesting financial assistance from ADB since August 2000\nand also trying to raise funds from commercial sources, with little success. In the absence of\nhelp from commercial sources, the Government has been forced to borrow from Marshall", "13\nIslands Development Bank (MIDB) and to dip into funds set aside for specific purposes. The\nGovernment wants to repay MIDB and correct these irregularities by using the funds made\navailable from its program loan. The Government also proposes to start a process of long term\npolicy  reforms  that  can  reverse  the  current  downward  trend  in  income  and  employment\ngeneration in the country and initiate a process of sustainable and self-reliant development over\nthe long-term. Such fundamental changes will need a sustained long-term effort. Support of the\nGovernment at this hour of need is appropriate and will enable the RMI to undertake major\nreforms that had been difficult in the past.\nF.  External Assistance to the Public Sector\n1.  Asian Development Bank\n46. ADB has provided nine loans totaling $59.1 million since the RMI joined ADB in April\n1990.  The  Ebeye  Health  and  Infrastructure  Project  is  being  implemented  while  the  Skills\nTraining  and  Vocational  Education  Project  just  started.  Both  projects  include  significant\nelements of sector reforms as well as national capacity building. TA grants totaling $14.53\nmillion for 37 TA projects have been provided as of March 2001; 29 projects have been\ncompleted.\n2.  International Monetary Fund/United Nations Development Programme\n47. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) carries out its annual Article IV consultations and\nhas provided TA in the past for studies leading to recommendations on improvements of the\nfiscal and taxation issues. The IMF is a full and active member of the Consultative Group for the\nRMI, and is in full support of the proposed Fiscal and Financial Management Program (FFMP)\nloan.  UNDP  support  has  been  concentrated  on  public  sector  management  improvement,\ntraining, and small enterprise development.\n3.  United States\n48. Since  the  Compact  became  effective  in  1986,  the  RMI  has  received  considerable\neconomic and technical assistance from the US, supplemented by federal grants and additional\nappropriations by the US Congress. As noted in paras. 3-5, the US is the dominant source of\nassistance to the RMI.\n4.  Others\n49. Japan\u2019s assistance primarily for infrastructure amounts to around $2 million annually.\nRecently, Japan rehabilitated all roads in Majuro. Japan is also providing funding for schools\nand hospitals. In 2000, Taipei,China, provided about $12 million in project funding including $3\nmillion in budget support.\n5.  Compact Negotiation: Status/Outcome\n50. The  Compact  renegotiation  is  expected  to  begin  in  May  2001  after  the  RMI  has\npresented its forward-looking strategy and confirmed the economic reform and policy direction it\nintends to take. The economic policy and reform action will be underpinned by the policy matrix\nand conditionalities under the proposed program loan. The renegotiation may take place in 18-\n24 months but must reach some conclusion by October 2003. Under the current Compact, there\nare  provisions  for  a  two-year  transition  period  after  expiration  pending  renegotiation.  The", "14\nGovernment will invoke the two-year transitory provision during which the level of Compact\nfunding will be at the average of the past 15 years. This will mean that over the next two years\nthe RMI will receive an amount estimated at $3 million-4 million higher than the current level of\nCompact support.\n51. While it is not prudent to speculate on the outcome of the negotiations, a few clear\nsignals from the US side indicate that: (i) in all likelihood this will be the last time economic\nprovisions of the Compact will be negotiated; (ii) use of Compact funds will be restricted, tied to\nspecific sectors (mostly social) and largely project specific; (iii) for the first time there will be\nconditionalities similar to those of ADB in the use and disbursement of funds; (iv) the US is\nlooking for an \u201cexit strategy\u201d and finds the ADB initiated trust fund concept acceptable in\nprinciple and a viable way for the RMI to attain self-reliance; (v) overall Compact funding is likely\nto decline, but the US remains concerned about continued economic stability and would like to\navoid  shocks  or  a  sharp  decline  in  per  capita  GDP;  (vi)  funding  decline  will  be  partly\ncompensated by separate allocation for placement into the trust fund; and (vii) the level of\nCompact funding and extent of \u201cnonearmarked funding\u201d (which allows the RMI flexibility to\nprioritize its own macroeconomic needs) will depend on the Government\u2019s strategy and extent\nof reforms undertaken, especially in improving public sector financial management.\n52. The US side believes that, without proper systems and accountability in public financial\nmanagement, the development and economic growth objectives of Compact funds will again not\nbe met and that funds will not reach the sectors or those who need them the most. Compact\nnegotiations have been in close consultation with ADB and ADB has been requested to take the\nlead during the two-year transitory period. In summary, the Compact will most likely be renewed\nfor another 15 years at probably 10-20 percent lower than the current level; there will be\nconditionalities and less \u201cnonearmarked\u201d funding and trust funds will be an integral part of the\nCompact negotiation. Other provisions such as immigration, and access to federal grant and\nprograms will continue as part of the security relations between the two countries.\nG.  ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategies in the Sector\n 53. On  30  January  1997,  ADB  approved  Loan  1513-RMI(SF):  Public Sector Reform\nProgram (PSRP). The main objectives were to (i) stabilize the Government\u2018s finances in the\nshort term through a combination of revenue increase and expenditure reduction measures,\n(ii) ensure the long-term structural stability of Government finances and sustainable efficiency\ngains, and (iii) improve the environment for private sector activities. The counterpart funds were\nto (i) compensate employees retrenched from the civil service, (ii) liquidate the high-interest\ndebt of AMI, and (iii) establish the Financial Reserve Trust Fund.3\n54. Important achievements made under the PSRP include the following:\n(i)  reducing by 36 percent the Government payroll from 2,303 in November 1995 to\nunder 1,500 employees in June 2000;\n(ii)  reducing ministries in the public service from 10 to 9;\n(iii)  freezing civil service wages from March 1996;\n(iv)  eliminating direct subsidies to AMI and reducing its most debilitating commercial\n                  \n3 Currently, Marshall Islands Intergenerational Trust Fund (MIITF).", "15\ndebt with improved management;\n(v)  streamlining the company registration process by removing the approval process\nfrom the Cabinet and vesting it in a Registrar of Corporations;\n(vi)  streamlining approval of licenses for foreign investment, removing the task from\nthe Cabinet and vesting it in a Registrar of Foreign Corporations under the new\nForeign Investment Business Legislation;\n(vii)  establishing the Marshall Islands Intergenerational Trust Fund (MIITF) to provide\nan additional source of revenue for the Government\u2019s budget;\n(viii)  providing a social safety net for retrenched Government employees through a\ncompensation  package  comprising  a  lump  sum  and  monthly  maintenance\npayments; and\n(ix)  privatizing domestic shipping services (which although experiencing problems, is\na policy the government is keen to pursue).\n55. Several problems were also identified in implementing the PSRP.\n(i)  Consultation with the community about the need or shape of the PSRP was\nadequate. The Program was initiated by then President Amata Kabua. After his\ndeath, no \u201cchampions\u201d of reform rose within the administration, generating the\nperception that outsiders were imposing the reforms.\n(ii)  Reducing subsidies to Government enterprises produced mixed results. Direct\nsubsidies to AMI were eliminated, but indirect subsidies continued by condoning\ndebts. After initially falling, subsidies to Tobolar Copra Processing Plant Ltd., the\ncopra processing authority, have returned to prereform program levels. On the\nplus side, the Majuro Electricity Corporation has not received an operational\nsubsidy for a number of years.\n(iii)  The reform program achieved its aim of stabilizing government finances in the\nshort  run.  The  structural  problems  remain.  The  institutional  mechanisms  to\nensure rational and well-informed decisions do not exist. Lack of budgeting and\nfinancial  management  skills  in  the  civil  service  compounds  the  institutional\nweakness of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).\n56. The most important lessons learned from this process were as follows.\n(i)  In  designing  reforms,  the  time  for  implementing  them  and  their  political\nimplications must be estimated realistically.\n(ii)  Institutional  mechanisms,  particularly  for  financial  management,  need  to  be\nstressed in the process as specific fiscal and economic policy measures can be\noverturned if the institutional mechanisms to consolidate these policies are not in\nplace.\n(iii)  Without effective financial management and control systems in the dominant\npublic sector, limited success can be achieved.", "16\n(iv)  Civil service downsizing needs to be complemented by specific measures to\nincrease the efficiency of the remaining civil service staff.\n(v)  Reform  measures  need  to  be  fully  discussed  beforehand  to  instill  both\nunderstanding and a sense of ownership before they are implemented.\nV.  THE PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n57. In January 2000 a new reform-minded Government was elected in the RMI with H.E.\nKessai Note as President. The new Government inherited a difficult fiscal position with rising\nexpenditures and stagnant revenues. Increased spending and tax reductions shortly before the\nNovember 1999 elections were compounded by optimistic revenue forecasts and led to a\nsubstantial current account deficit of $5.9 million in FY1999. The full impact of these changes\nwas felt in FY2000, the election year, and resulted in a $11.8 million deficit.\n58. The Government recognizes that many current problems are linked to deficiencies in\npublic financial management. Public financial management has suffered from years of neglect\nand is in need of major reform to improve budgeting, monitoring of, and accountability for public\nfunds. Fiscal policy is further constrained by an absence of reserves and a narrow revenue\nbase.  Long-term  revenue  prospects  remain  heavily  reliant  on  continued  prospects  for\nrenegotiations of economic assistance provisions under the Compact. Future reforms should\nfocus on raising public service productivity levels, while keeping a lid on the numbers of staff in\nthe  service.  The  Government  recognizes  that  there  is  a  window  of  opportunity  to  lock  in\nimportant reforms over the next year or two and build a sustainable future by prudent use of\nfinancial resources.\n59. The proposed assistance comes at an opportune time in that it coincides with the\nnegotiations of the economic provisions of the Compact with the US. Establishing improved\nfinancial and economic management systems now will underpin the use of future assistance\nand  set  a  platform  for  sustainable  fiscal  policy.  The  establishment  of  the  MIITF  is  the\ncornerstone of the reforms, modified from the successful models developed elsewhere in the\nregion. However, stable fiscal policy and strong financial management are needed to make this\nmodel successful.\n60. The  Government  is  moving  to  address  these  problems  by  seeking  to  improve  its\nfinancial  management,  broadening  its  tax  base  and  strengthening  the  MIITF,  which  will\neventually replace Compact revenues in the long term. Complementing these moves, ADB is\nassisting  the  administration  in  preparing  the  Meto2000  economic  report  and  development\nstrategy.  The  Meto2000  resulted  from  wide  consultation  with  the  community  to  determine\nappropriate development policies so as to assist the Government\u2019s negotiations with the US\nover the renewal of the economic provisions of the Compact. The Government has conducted a\nNational  Economic  and  Social  Summit  to  seek  the  views  of  the  community  on  future\ndevelopment prospects and policies to which Meto2000 will be a major input.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n61. The Government and ADB recognize the opportunity presented by the renegotiation of\nthe Compact in ensuring long-term economic sustainability of the RMI by ensuring prudent use\nof future Compact assistance. The proposed ADB assistance, while stabilizing the immediate", "17\nfiscal situation, aims primarily at longer term issues of improving overall financial management\nin the RMI. The specific objectives of the financial assistance are to (i) ensure a sustainable\nincome  flow  for  future  generations,  (ii)  strengthen  public  sector  financial  and  economic\nmanagement, (iii) stabilize the fiscal position, (iv) enhance the policy environment for private\nsector development to maximize the benefits from future Compact assistance, and (v) increase\nthe effectiveness of the public service.\n62. The time-bound policies to be implemented under the Program are described in the\npolicy  matrix  in  Appendix  2.  The  Government  has  confirmed  the  general  direction  of  the\nProgram in a development policy letter attached as Appendix 1.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n1.  Ensure a Sustainable Income Flow for Future Generations\n63. Small Pacific island states such as the RMI have limited ability to maintain steady\nrevenue streams indefinitely so as to fund all the services normally demanded in an island\nnation. A trust fund established in a number of island states has been a successful model to\nensure the sustainability of Government finances. The view is that a trust fund can be built up\nover time through external contributions or windfall gains, with the real earnings of the fund\nbeing available to finance structural budget deficits. The key to sustainability of these funds is\nensuring that their capital is maintained in real value. Both Kiribati and Tuvalu, two countries\nsimilar to the RMI in many ways, have successfully adopted such a model. They have large\ntrust funds established and invested with professional fund managers with strong governance\nstructures to ensure the integrity of the funds. The funds have established a platform for both\ncountries\u2019 long-term development.\n64. Seeing  the  success  of  these  countries,  the  RMI  established  the  MIITF  through\nlegislation. The  Government has expressed its desire to build up balances in the MIITF by\nusing proceeds from the renegotiation of the economic provisions of the Compact. To do this\nthe Government intends to develop more stringent operational guidelines to revise the MIITF\nlegislation  to  more  strongly  protect  the  capital  of  the  fund  and  strengthen  its  governance\nprocedures. Specifically, the implementing guidelines and regulation related to MIITF legislation\nwill ensure that:\n(i)  the capital of the MIITF is maintained in real terms;\n(ii)  an independent Advisory Committee will be appointed to provide independent\nreports to the Board of Directors of MIITF on fiscal policy, economic and social\nconditions within the Marshall Islands, and management issues of the MIITF;\n(iii)  the Advisory Committee reports will be made available to the Nitijela;\n(iv)  the  Board  of  Directors  will  appoint  on  a  competitive  bidding  process  a\nprofessional investment consultant to report to the Board of Directors on the\nperformance of the fund managers;\n(v)  the Board of Directors or the professional investment consultant will appoint one\nor more reputable international fund managers to manage the MIITF;\n(vi)  annual  audited  accounts  for  the  MIITF  by  an  independent  auditor  will  be", "18\npublished within 6 months of the end of the MIITF\u2019s financial year; and\n(vii)  an annual report prepared by the Board of Directors, including the audited annual\naccounts, will be made available to the Nitijela.\n65. In addition, the Government will set aside the vast majority of the funds available from\nthe Compact with the long-term goal of building the MIITF to a level where its returns will\nultimately replace Compact assistance. Strengthening the MIITF and its continued funding by\nthe  Government  is  the  cornerstone  of  this  program  loan.  Based  on  some  conservative\nassumptions about investment earnings, a fund in the region of $500 million dollars (in 2000\nprices) will be needed to replace a significant part of the Compact assistance and maintain\nstandards of living in the RMI.\n66. The Government will guarantee that in operating the MIITF, the following conditions will\napply.\n(i)  The amounts indicated below will be deposited in the MIITF:\n(a)  the whole of any incremental gain from the Compact receipts as well as\n70 percent in the first year and 60 percent in the second year of the\nnonearmarked grant portion of the economic provisions of the Compact\navailable during the two-year extension period after 2001;\n(b)  50 percent of the nonearmarked grant portion of receipts under future\nCompact provisions after 2003; and\n(c)  the whole of any additional Compact payments for MIITF.\n(ii)  The capital of the MIITF is not available for expenditure by the Government or\nany other person.\n(iii)  the  capital  of  the  MIITF  may  not  be  used  as  collateral  for  Government\nborrowings;\n(iv)  The first use of the income of the MIITF will be reinvestment to maintain the real\nvalue of the MIITF\u2019s capital.\n(v)  After  the  MIITF  reaches  a  target  figure  of  $0.5  billion  (in  2000  prices),  the\nbalance of MIITF\u2019s annual income\u2014after maintenance of real capital value and\nmeeting the management costs\u2014will be available to the Government for the\nNitijela to appropriate for expenditure through the annual budget process.\n2.  Strengthen Public Sector Financial and Economic Management\n67. The fiscal problems experienced in the RMI can be directly linked to deficiencies in the\nsystems of budgeting and financial management that were unable to handle the huge grants\nforthcoming from the Compact. The budget format provides little information for scrutiny of the\ngovernment\u2019s expenditure patterns, which limits the Government\u2019s ability to make informed\ndecisions about funding priorities and the public\u2019s ability to question these spending priorities.\nThe budget is prepared with only the most basic of projections on revenues, expenditures, and\ninformation on past expenditure trends. In this environment, fiscal policy decisions often enter", "19\nthe realm of guesswork and are subject to arbitrary decision making, often to the advantage of\nvested interests.\na.  Improving Financial Management\n68. A top priority is to reform and strengthen public financial management. This involves\nimproving the annual budget format to conform to internationally accepted practices, financial\ncontrol mechanism, accounting system, and the reporting system; and developing a medium-\nterm framework for planning and performance evaluation. The overarching objectives of these\nreforms  will  be  to  ensure  transparency,  accountability,  establishment  of  input/output\nrelationships, and cost effectiveness of public sector  financial management.  A summary of\nthese changes are given in Appendix 3. A detailed time-bound action plan clearly indicating the\nspecific steps to achieve the objectives  will be prepared jointly by ADB-funded consultants and\nthe PFTAC team. In preparing the time schedule for action, due consideration will be given to\navailable institutional capacity  to implement these reforms.\n69. Improving fiscal and financial management of the public sector is a critical outcome of\nthe program. Therefore, adequate resources for advisory services have been provided under\nthe loan and supported by the piggybacked TA. The new budget preparation procedures and\nsystems will be undertaken under the guidance and with the support of the budget advisor from\nPFTAC who has been involved in the preparatory stage of this project.\n70. To complement these actions, the Secretary of Finance will issue financial instructions\nand  regulations  under  the  Financial  Management  Act  to  govern  accounting  procedures,\ncompetitive tendering, and any procedures needed to safeguard public finances. The Financial\nManagement Act will be reviewed to ensure that the act and related legislation continue to meet\nthe needs of the Government. The incorporation of the desired reforms in legislation will reduce\nthe risk of reversal by future administrations.\nb.  Improving Corporate Governance\n71. The financial relationships between the Government and its public sector enterprises\n(PSEs) have in the past contributed to the poor economic performance of the RMI. Placing\nthese relationships on a solid and sustainable basis is an important factor in managing the\nGovernment\u2019s financial situation. This was demonstrated by the problems experienced as a\nresult of losses experienced by AMI in the 1990s which directly impacted on the Government\u2019s\nbudget. The current problems in MISSA are another example. It is important to make these\nfinancial  relationships  as  transparent  as  possible  to  avoid  financial  problems  and  also  to\nexamine whether the relationship is appropriate or whether other models can be used.\n72. To  overcome  existing  and  potential  problems,  the  Government  is  committed  to\ncompletely review the corporate governance of its PSEs. An important part of this review will\nassess where PSEs merit subsidies, recommend how corporate governance can improve the\noutcomes delivered by these institutions, and also identify measures to strengthen financial\nplanning, management, and reporting for improved delivery. The review will recommend a plan\nand timetable of reductions in subsidies to minimize the impact on the Government\u2019s finances.\nc.  The  Economic  Policy,  Planning  and  Statistics  Office,  and  the\nNational Policy Coordinating Committee\n73. During  Cabinet  deliberations,  ministers  often  do  not  benefit  from  analysis  of  the\neconomic impact of proposals, especially the impact on the Government\u2019s budgetary situation.", "20\nThe Office of Planning and Statistics (OPS) has this role spelled out in the legislation that\nestablished it. In reality, however, OPS has not been able to fulfil its mandate due to factors of\nlocation, capacity, its statistical focus, and lack of demand for its services as a policy advisory\nbody.\n74. To overcome this deficiency, the Government intends to establish the Economic Policy,\nPlanning and Statistics Office (EPPSO). In creating EPPSO, the Government wishes to draw on\nexisting resources, such as those in OPS, MOF, and other policy offices within the Government,\nrather than set up a new and separate institution. Using existing resources will help ensure the\nstaffing and institutionalization of EPPSO. Short-term TA from ADB and other sources could be\na supplement, especially when EPPSO needs to benefit from specialist inputs.\n75. EPPSO will act as the secretariat for a newly established National Policy Coordinating\nCommittee (NPCC) with membership drawn from the senior levels of the civil service but also\nbenefiting from the Chairmanship and representation drawn from the Cabinet. The NPCC will\nevaluate policy proposals going to the Cabinet, with analysis provided by EPPSO. The NPCC\nwill consider issues from formulating the budget to policy and project requests coming from\nministries. To avoid duplication of effort, the NPCC will assume the responsibility of existing\ncommittees such as the Budget Coordinating Committee and the Loans Committee. To ensure\nthe effectiveness of EPPSO and the NPCC, EPPSO will be responsible to the Office of the\nPresident and will be located within the Cabinet Office. Appendix 4 gives more details of the\noperation and structure of the EPPSO and NPCC.\n3.  Stabilize the Fiscal Position\n76. The  difficult  financial  position  is  threatening  basic  government.  Immediate  action  is\nneeded  to  stabilize  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position  and  this  involves  improving  revenue\ncollection and containing expenditures.\n77. On  the  revenue  side,  the  Government\u2019s  main  sources  of  funds  are  foreign  grants.\nHowever, most of these funds are earmarked for specific purposes. Discretionary revenue is\ndrawn from a narrow base, which needs to be broadened. In recent times, the tax regime has\nbeen the subject of several reform proposals. However, changes in the tax regime are strongly\nopposed  by  various  sections  of  the  community.  Much  of  this  opposition  stems  from  the\ngovernment\u2019s limited enforcement capacity. Lack of enforcement means that many businesses\nare avoiding paying their share of tax and that leads to justifiable resistance to tax increases as\nthese will unfairly penalize the existing taxpayers.\n78. The Government proposes to strengthen the tax collection division with more trained\nstaff (including the use of private agencies) to collect arrears, check evasion, and to properly\nenforce existing laws. While improving tax collection, the Government also intends to review\nand possibly reverse the decision made to reduce the import duties from 12 percent to 5 percent\nin early 1999. It is proposed that this rate be increased to at least 8 percent by October 2001\nand additional reforms be made based on a detailed review of the national and local tax\nregimes.\n79. While these are immediate actions, the Government is aware of other problems that will\ntake longer to overcome. The Government is aware of anomalies in parts of the tax system. For\nexample, by regional and international standards personal income tax is high for the lowest-paid\nwage earners and low for the middle and upper income brackets. The gross revenue tax is\nsimple in concept and theoretically easy to administer, but it is paid on gross output value at", "21\neach stage in (produce/process chain sale), producing a cascading effect of tax being paid on\ntax. The gross revenue tax takes no account of enterprise profitability \u2013 as a good business tax\nshould \u2013 and is reportedly subject to widespread evasion and undercollection.\n80. The  overall  tax  picture  is  further  fragmented  by  the  wide  taxing  powers  of  local\ngovernments. Anomalies are created by uncoordinated taxing actions at local level, potentially\nnegating the fiscal intentions of the national Government and compounding the problems of the\ntaxpayer. Statutory and administrative action is needed to integrate national and local taxation\ninto a single scheme that, for example, limits levels of local tax, allows offsets against national\ntax liabilities, and is simple for the taxpayer to operate. The introduction of a value-added tax\nwas proposed as part of an earlier comprehensive review of taxation in 1996. The idea met\nresistance from the commercial sector, and the overall tax reform plan was abandoned as\nnational elections approached.\n81. The Government intends to correct the anomalies in the tax system, especially the\nregressive nature of the regime, but feels that it is not ready for immediate action. With help\nfrom the accompanying TA project, the Government will review the tax system to look at\nanomalies  and  make  recommendations  leading  to  improved  efficiency  and  fairness  of  the\nregime while broadening and deepening the Government\u2019s tax base.\n82. On the expenditure side, the Government is working to control various components of\nthe general fund budget. Although significant progress was made during the PSRP, pressure is\nnow  building  to  increase  public  sector  employment  and  expand  government  services.  To\ncontain expenditures, the Government will\n(i)  maintain the freeze on salaries of public servants, elected officials, and contract\nworkers for at least two years \u2013 FY2002 and FY2003 \u2013 or until the review of\npublic service salaries is completed and implemented;\n(ii)  enforce a cap of 5 percent on general fund expenditure growth starting from a\nbaseline  amount  of  $29.5  million  for  FY2001,  excluding  certain  one-time\nexpenditures and payment of prior-year liabilities;\n(iii)  increase employee and employer contributions to the MISSA health fund back to\n3.5 percent by legislation;\n(iv)  limit to $4.0 million overseas referral costs for FY2002 on an accrual basis and\nfurther reduce it in FY2003 to match revenue from the Basic Health Care Fund,\nestimated at $2.8 million;\n(v)  increase funding for on-island health care in FY2002 to at least $2.8 million to be\nfunded entirely from the Health Care Revenue Facility;\n(vi)  cap subsidy to health expenditures at $1.2 million per year in FY2002;\n(vii)  eliminate all subsidies by FY2003, excluding the copra subsidy; and\n(viii)  review  the  copra  subsidy  and  its  possible  replacement  with  alternative\nmechanisms for income transfer to less advantaged outer islands.", "22\n4.  Enhance the Policy Environment for the Private Sector\n83. Recent government reforms have improved the policy environment for the private sector.\nThe  new  administration  has  legislated  improvements  in  company  registration  and  foreign\ninvestment procedures. Despite the improvements, significant impediments to investment and\nprivate sector development still need to be addressed.\n84. Land access is the most prominent of these impediments. The Government has drafted\nlegislation  that  will  establish  a  land  registration  authority  where  landowners  interested  in\nregistering their land for investment purposes can voluntarily register their land after the integrity\nof the title is verified. An added advantage of the system is that leases will subsequently be\nindependent of title in cases where inheritance of land is disputed. Such disputes will not affect\nalready existing leases. The review of the tax system (para. 81) is also aimed at strengthening\nthe incentives in the taxation regime.\n85. The role of the MIDB will also be investigated to reorient its efforts to a more business\nadvisory role: from direct lending to assisting businesses to access credit from commercial\nbanks, since direct lending has been subject to significant political interference. Complementing\nthis change will be measures to ensure that appropriate microcredit schemes are established to\ngive credit access to small businesses, women, youth, and other sectors of the community\nnormally  denied  access  to  credit.  Finally,  MIDB  will  renew  its  efforts  to  recover  as  much\nnonperforming debt as possible.\n5.  Increase the Effectiveness of the Public Service\n86. A large and inefficient public service has historically limited the ability of the Government\nto deliver services. The service has been seen as a way of distributing the wealth forthcoming\nfrom the Compact rather than from the executive arm of Government. The Constitution of the\nRMI even backs this perception. Recent reforms have managed to reduce the size of the public\nservice  to  manageable  levels  and  changed  perceptions  about  the  role  of  the  service.\nNevertheless,  there  is  still  strong  pressure  inside  and  outside  of  Government  to  increase\nrecruitment to solve the service delivery problems, although experience indicates additional\npersonnel will have little effect.\n87. Reducing the civil service has eliminated many underperforming staff, but there is still\nmuch inefficiency. A key improvement to the service will be matching the staff with skills to\nspecific jobs and retraining so that the Government can redeploy staff between areas of the civil\nservice rather than recruit new staff. Better qualifications in the professional areas will need to\nbe linked more closely to the Government\u2019s training and scholarship policy to ensure that skills\nshortages can be overcome. The review will look closely at salary and wage levels in the public\nservice. A key aspect of improving the public service is the need to pay wages commensurate\nwith  productivity  levels,  ample  anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  wage  levels  far  exceed\nproductivity levels. High wage levels in the public service also make it difficult for the private\nsector to attract and retain skilled staff.\n88. A review of the service will look at a range of issues. The focus of the reforms will be\nbetter  management  of  human  resources,  including  redeployment  and  retraining,\nappropriateness  of  pay  scales,  conditions  of  public  service,  and  appropriate  delegation  of\nauthority. Linkage will be established between financial and human resource inputs and outputs\n(delivery and service levels) for each ministry. Additional resources to carry out the program for\nimproving the effectiveness of the public sector will be sought from other donors such as the US", "23\nand Australia. Component for specialist inputs under the program loan may also be used.\n89. As the government moves to contract out more services, the nature of the public service\nchanges from direct service delivery to contract management. To provide for the new skills\nneeded to cope with this change, the government will conduct courses to train administrators in\nhow to manage and enforce contracts to ensure that the government gets best value for money.\nContracting-out arrangements in the Government have not delivered the benefits expected\nmainly due to the inability of the public service to enforce and regulate contracts, given that the\nrole is new and unfamiliar. As mentioned in para. 60, the government will improve financial\nmanagement and budget preparation skills. Where the government is still in the business of\ndirectly providing services to the community, the relevant staff will be trained in all aspects of\ncustomer service. The Government will also investigate the possibility of establishing a cadre of\ncivil servants that will enter the service based on the results of competitive examinations.\nD.  Poverty  and Governance Issues\n1.  Poverty\n90. There are aspects of the loan that address all three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction\nstrategy: pro-poor economic growth, equitable social development, and good governance.\n91. The  serious  deterioration  in  the  Government  of  RMI\u2019s  fiscal  situation  has  led  to  a\ncompounding effect on the poor in the RMI. Measures in the loan are designed to address two\nissues that are causing some hardship among the poor. The first is the Government\u2019s current\ninability to buy copra due to fiscal constraints. This is causing hardship in the poorer outer\nislands where copra sales are an important part of household cash incomes. Copra prices are\nsubsidized  by  the  Government,  and  Government  purchase  of  this  product  is  a  form  of\nredistributing income to the poor.\n92. Second, the arrears associated with poor management of the medical referral system\nhas led to large claims on the Government. Current outstanding claims estimated at $3.7 million\nhave been deferred. The effect of these outstanding claims has been a rundown of operating\nrevenue in the Ministry of Health, with a resulting decline in delivery of health services. Funds\nfrom the loan will ensure that payments on the copra and health referral backlog can be\naddressed.  In  the  case  of  copra,  the  measures  will  be  pro-poor  and  underpin  growth\nopportunities in the outer island economies. The health measures will result in improved, more\nequitable access to services for poorer Marshallese in the medium term. The issues are further\ndiscussed in paras. 42 and 119.\n93. There are measures in the loan to address the management of the public sector. Public\nsector  wages  have  been  much  higher  than  those  in  the  private  sector.  As  a  result,  a\ndisproportionate share of Government fiscal resources is spent on wages, while operational\nexpenditure experience a shortfall. Redressing this imbalance will be an important aspect of the\nloan, and will result in long-term benefits to the wider Marshallese community. By ensuring more\nresources are available for long-term productive investment, these measures are likely to result\nin sustainable economic growth.\n94. In addition to managing of the public sector, there are measures in the loan to address\nmanagement  of  the  financial  sector.  Medium-term  expenditure  planning  processes  will  be\nintroduced, with output-oriented budgeting, performance measurements, and linkages to the\nmedium-term development plan. In addition, there will be financial control measures to ensure", "24\nthat expenditure decisions are made in an environment of transparency and accountability and\nthat succeeding administrations will find such decisions difficult to reverse. Recognizing that\ntransparency,  accountability,  and  predictability  are  vital  aspects  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  good\ngovernance, these measures are expected to result in significant improvements to governance,\nand as such, can be regarded as pro-poor in nature. A poverty impact assessment is in\nAppendix 5.\n2.  Governance\n95. Good governance is the cornerstone of any economy. In its absence, an economy will\nnot  function  effectively  or  efficiently,  its  potential  for  growth  will  be  stifled,  and  equity  of\ndistribution  will  be  compromised.  The  people  that  suffer  most  will  be  the  poor  and\nunderprivileged who do not have the power or influence to capture a fair share of the nation\u2019s\nincome.\n96. Since independence, the RMI has had a history of poor governance. This culminated in\nthe prolifigate use of the funds provided by the US under the first Compact of Free Association.\nWhile a few families based in Majuro managed to become wealthy, many others, particularly\nthose on some of the outer islands, received little if any benefit. The problem has now been\nrecognized and ADB, among others, is attempting to help the RMI Government to address\npoverty issues in the outer islands. But for any project to succeed and for scarce resources to\nreach the poorest, fundamental changes in public sector financial management are required to\nimprove efficiency in the use of limited funding. Transparency, equitable distribution, and special\nconsideration for the needs of the poor are critical.\n97. Once again, ADB is in a dilemma. While the situation calls for support, past experience\nhas  been  disappointing.  However,  there  are  real  grounds  for  hope  that  the  situation  has\nchanged. If the needs of the new government are ignored, the reformers will in effect be\npenalized for the actions of their predecessors. At the same time, a lot of poor people will be\ncondemned to increasing poverty with little hope of improvement.\nVI.  THE PROPOSED LOANS\nA.  Amount of the Loans and Source of Funds\n98. The proposed loans total $12.0 million equivalent from the ordinary capital resources\n(OCR) as well as special funds (SF) resources. The OCR loan amount will be $4,000,000 and\nthe SF loan SDR 6,320,000 ($8.0 million equivalent). OCR funding has been provided for\npurposes that are likely to result in cost savings and/or help fiscal balance. SF sources have\nbeen proposed for the adjustment costs for improving social indicators, promoting trust funds,\nstrengthening  the  financial  management  system,  initiating  good  governance,  and  building\ncapacity as well as implementing the program.\n99. The  Program  is  designed  to  achieve  long-term  sustainability  and  short-term  fiscal\nstability. As such, the size of the loan was based on the proposed costs of adjustments and\nreforms as follows.\n(i)  The allocation for MIITF supports the trust fund and provides additional impetus\nto the Government to use trust funds as an additional source of income and for\nlong-term  self-reliance.  The  MIITF  is  a  major  objective  of  the  Program  loan\n(estimated at $2.0 million).", "25\n(ii)  Payment  of  health  arrears  not  only  relieves  pressure  on  the  Government\u2019s\nfinancial  situation,  it  also  addresses  an  urgent  social  need.  As  explained  in\nparagraph 41, the Government must clear arrears in overseas referral payments\nto be able to refer patients for secondary and tertiary care currently not available\non  the  island.  Several  critically  ill  patients  cannot  be  sent  abroad  as  the\nGovernment  has  been  unable  to  generate  adequate  resources  to  meet  the\nsudden requirement for health payments (estimated at $3.5 million).\n(iii)  With the adverse fiscal situation arising from the cutback in import duties and the\neconomic downturn, the Government has been obliged to secure a short-term\ncommercial facility at less than favorable terms and interest rates and temporarily\nuses funds mandated for other uses. By retiring the high-cost commercial loan,\nthe Government\u2019s financial situation will be stabilized over the next 2-3 years\n(estimated at $2.5 million).\n(iv)  The  fiscal  balance  support  will  be  provided  over  18  months  to  give  the\nGovernment  time  to  make  the  necessary  adjustments  in  its  revenues  and\nexpenditure. The fiscal situation is likely to be difficult in the context of external\nshock  arising  from  the  economic  downturn  as  well  as  fuel  and  other  price\nincreases. On the revenue side, the Government intends to increase import\nduties  within  FY2001,  but  the  impact  will  be  realized  only  in  FY2002/2003\n(estimated at $1.5 million).\n(v)  Costs  for  improving  the  accounting  system  and  implementing  improved  tax\ncollection and enforcement which are aimed at better fiscal management and\nimprove  Government  ability  to  more  effectively  utilize  external  resources\n(estimated at $1.5 million).\n(vi)  Financing  of  specialist  inputs,  Compact  renegotiation  costs,  and  program\nimplementation costs directly relate to furthering the objectives of the program\nand ensuring that the reforms are achieved (estimated at $1.0 million).\n100. Given the structure of the RMI economy, assessment of the ability to pay ADB\u2019s loan\nfunded from the OCR was based on the extent of net available nonearmarked funds from the\neconomic provisions under the Compact agreement. Currently the nonearmarked portion of\nCompact funds pays the RMI\u2019s bond obligations. These bond obligations will be fully paid by\nOctober  2001.  Nonearmarked  Compact  funds  will  then  be  available  to  the  RMI  to  meet\ndiscretionary expenditures. If the economic provisions are not renegotiated by the end of 2001,\na provision of the Compact allows for an automatic 2-year extension at a funding level that is the\naverage of the past 15 years. Consequently, it is likely that the RMI will receive a higher amount\nfor 2002 and 2003, pending renewal of the economic provisions of the Compact. Subsequently,\nwhen the affected provisions are renegotiated (most probable outcome), a certain level of\nnonearmarked funds are expected to continue to be available to the RMI. In projecting the\nextent of  nonearmarked funds, a 10-20 percent drop was estimated starting 2004 and followed\nby a 10 percent step-down every five years. Such estimate is merely for the sake of projections\nand does not in any way reflect negotiating positions or the final outcome of the Compact\nrenegotiations. These estimates are premised on indications that discretionary funds under the\nCompact  are  likely  to  be  reduced  as  the  economic  provisions  are  made  project/program\nspecific. It is also assumed that the Government intends to set aside 50-60 percent of the\nnonearmarked  funds  for  the  MIITF  for  purposes  of  achieving  long-term  self-reliance.  The\nprojected loan repayment schedule (Appendix 6) shows that the RMI will be able to meet its", "26\nOCR obligations based on the preceding assumptions.\n101. Considering the above, it is proposed that a $4.0 million loan be provided on OCR terms\nto fund components that are expected to generate direct savings. The SF loan of $8.0 million\nwill be primarily utilized for meeting implementation costs in the areas relating to the health\nsector;  capacity  building  for  improved  economic  management,  in  particular  for  improved\ngovernance in the financial and fiscal sectors; and for creating sustainable development to\nserve future generations. A logical framework for the Program is in Appendix 7.\nB.  Interest, Maturity, and Implementation Period\n102. The Borrower will be the RMI. The OCR loan will have a maturity of 15 years, including a\ngrace period of 3 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable\nlending rate system for US dollar loans, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent, and commitment charge\nof 0.75 percent per annum. The SF loan will have a repayment period of 24 years including a\ngrace period of 8 years and a 1 percent interest charge during the grace period, and 1.5 percent\nthereafter. The loans are expected to be disbursed over 36 months, from June 2001 to May\n2004.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n103. MOF will be the Executing Agency for the loan and will have overall responsibility to\nimplement  the  Program.  A  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  chaired  by  the  Minister  of\nFinance  and  comprising  selected  Cabinet  members,  representative  of  the  Office  of  the\nPresident, and secretaries of key ministries will be established prior to loan effectiveness. The\nPSC will be responsible for providing high level policy guidance. MOF will be supported by a\nProgram Coordination Unit (PCU) headed by a program coordinator. The PCU staff will include\nan accountant, supported by consultant inputs financed by the loan and TA grant. The PCU will\nprovide monthly reports on progress on the policy matrix and highlight any proposed changes\nand actions taken. Reports will also provide an assessment of whether the new setup and\narrangements such as EPPSO are working effectively.\nD.  Procurement\n104. The proceeds of the loans will be disbursed against a broad range of imports with the\ncounterpart funds generated to be used to support the costs of program implementation and\nrelated adjustment costs. The proceeds of the loans will only be used to finance items produced\nand procured in ADB member countries except the ineligible items specified in a negative list\n(Appendix 8). The Borrower will submit with each withdrawal request a certification that the\nvalue of total net eligible imports is expected to be equal or greater than the amount of the ADB\nprojected  disbursements  under  the  program  loan  in  a  given  period  and  that  the  required\nwithdrawal  will  be  used  to  finance  eligible  items  procured  in  accordance  with  the  loan\nagreement provisions. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify\nthe accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. Procurement using loan funds will be based on\nnormal commercial practice by the private sector, except that goods commonly traded on\ninternational commodity markets will be procured in accordance with procedures. ADB will\ncontinue to ensure that standard public and private sector procurement procedures used in the\nDMC concerned are adequate from the point of view of competition and efficiency.", "27\nE.  Consulting Services\n105. The Program will require about 30 person-months of international and about 36 person-\nmonths domestic consulting services. There will be specialists in (i) tax advisory consultancy, (ii)\npublic financial management, (iii) trust fund administration, (iv) program implementation, and (v)\nother specialization as agreed upon with ADB. The consultants will be selected and engaged in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\nF.  Disbursement\n106. MOF will ensure that funds released under each tranche are utilized for the purpose for\nwhich they are designated (Table 5). ADB project administration will monitor the use of funds\nand require regular disbursement reports. MOF will be required to confirm that payments for\nhealth arrears, repayment of MIDB loan, and deposits to MIITF (in accordance with Table 5)\nhave been made against each tranche release.\nTable 5: Program Loans Allocation\n($ million)\nItem 1st 2nd 3rd Total OCR SF\nTranche Tranche Tranche\n1.

Items 5, 6, and 7 involve use of counterpart funds for specific use throughout the\nprogram period. Funds corresponding to these items must be placed in a separate account to\nensure  timely  availability.  Arrangements  will  be  made  between  MOF  and  ADB  project\nadministration for proper accounting and monitoring of expenditures from such accounts.\nG.  Counterpart Funds\n108. Counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the loans will be utilized to\nfinance the costs associated with implementing the Program and will be utilized as follows :\n(i)  allocation to MIITF (estimated at $2.0 million SF);\n(ii)  health sector payments arising from change in credit terms of health service\nproviders and deferred past due obligations (estimated at $3.5 million SF);\n(iii)  retirement of portions of high-cost short-term commercial debt incurred to meet\nfiscal deficit in FY2000 (estimated at $2.5 million OCR);\n(iv)  fiscal balance support to meet additional expenditures and/or revenue shortfalls\nin FY2001 and FY2002 (estimated at $1.5 million OCR);\n(v)  adjustment costs associated with required changes in the financial accounting", "28\nsystem to make it more responsive to proposed improvements in public financial\nmanagement to support stronger control, accountability, and better governance\n(estimated at $600,000 SF);\n(vi)  costs to improve tax collection and enforce tax and customs duties (estimated at\n$900,000 SF); and\n(vii)  financing specialist inputs to improve public financial management, supervise\nestablishment and operation of a trust fund, support Compact renegotiation, and\nother needs to support program implementation (estimated at $1,000,000 SF).\nH.  Monitoring and Tranching\n109. ADB will periodically review program implementation and will closely monitor its progress\nand  impact  on  the  performance  targets.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the\noutcome  of  policy  discussions  with  other  development  agencies  and  their  implications  for\nprogram implementation.\n110. In  addition  to  quarterly  progress  reports,  the  Government  will  submit  a  program\ncompletion report to ADB within three months of the loan closing date. This report will evaluate\nthe implementation of the policy measures during the program period, and further reforms and\nassistance needed in the medium term.\n111. The loans funds will be released in three tranches. The first \u2013 $4.3 million equivalent \u2013\nwill be made available after loan effectiveness and upon compliance with first-tranche conditions\n(Appendix 9). The second tranche \u2013 $5.4 million equivalent \u2013 will be disbursed upon compliance\nwith  second-tranche  conditions  approximately  9-12  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The\nremaining balance \u2013 $2.3 million equivalent \u2013 will be released after fulfillment of third-tranche\nconditions.  Table  6  shows  the  distribution  of  OCR/SF  funds  to  be  released  against  each\ntranche.\nTable 6: Program Loans Tranche Releases\n($ million)\nItem 1st Tranche 2nd Tranche 3rd Tranche Total\nOrdinary Capital Resources 2.0 1.5 0.5 4.0\nLoan\nSpecial Funds Loan 2.3 3.9 1.8 8.0\nTotal 4.3 5.4 2.3 12.0\n112. The tranche amounts are consistent with the extent of reforms undertaken. The bulk of\nthe loans will be disbursed after major second-tranche conditions are met. A third tranche\nensures continued engagement and monitoring of reforms required under the policy matrix.\nVII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n113. Over the years, the capacity for economic management in the country has improved. A\ncadre of young Marshallese has world-class training in economic and business management\nand older Marshallese have been getting on-the-job experience in economic management since\nindependence. However, the development program currently envisaged by the Government", "29\nrequires high-level expertise, not all of which is currently available in the country. TA funding will\nbe required to mobilize that expatriate expertise. The Government has classified the required\ninputs into two categories: (i) those that will generate revenues for the government over the\nshort, medium, or long term; and (ii) those that will be of a general developmental character.\nThe Government has requested that the activities in the first category be funded from the SF\ncomponent of the Program loan and those in the second category by TA grants from ADB.\n114. ADB will provide on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program a TA for (i) fiscal\nand financial advisory services, (ii) economic strategy advice, and (iii) building capacity for a\nmore efficient public service. The TA will fund the services of economic and financial advisers\nand support the PCU with consultant inputs to ensure compliance with the policy matrix, and\nundertake benefit monitoring and effective program implementation. The second part of the TA\nwill provide economic management advisory support to the EPPSO for activities mentioned in\nthe policy matrix, and the third component will assist the Government to develop in-house\ncompetencies and capacity for public sector management. TA closing date will be co-terminus\nwith loan closing in May 2004. TA details are in Appendix 10.\nVIII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Program Benefits\n115. The most strategic contribution of the Program will be over the long term. Without the\ntype of reforms envisaged under the Program, development performance over the next 15 years\nmay not differ from that of the preceding 15 years, namely, increasing unemployment and\ncontinued decline in per capita incomes. It also means that at the end of the next Compact\nagreement, reduced foreign inflows will result in sharp economic decline in the RMI.\n116. With  the  successful  implementation  of  reforms,  the  country\u2019s  developmental\nperformance will experience a turnaround. With the MIITF fund of about $ 0.5 billion (in 2000\nprices) to be reached in 15 years, the country will have gained financial strength to sustain its\nperformance even if Compact funding is substantially reduced. If the program objectives are\nrealized, at the end of 15 years balances in the country\u2019s trust fund can generate in perpetuity a\nflow of annual incomes of about $25 million (in 2000 prices). With better management of its\nresources, the country can stop the decline in per capita incomes. And with programs for\nemployment generation, it can avoid the baseline scenario of increasing unemployment and\npoverty.\n117. The primary gain in the medium term will be the improved budgetary situation and\ndevelopmental effectiveness of the public sector. Improvement in the budgetary situation will\ncome primarily from two program components: (i) increased import duty and efficient collection\nof revenue in general, and (ii) cap on growth of current government expenditures. At the end of\nfour years, the current account deficit in the budget is expected to be substantially eliminated.\n118.  The immediate short-term objective of the Program is to prevent a budgetary crisis. The\neconomic structure of the country depends heavily on the Government sector. As noted in para.\n37, the financial assets of the Government will be nearly exhausted if present trends continue.\nThe  Government  may  not  be  able  to  pay  wages  and  salaries  to  its  employees.  With  an\nextended family system, a typical Government worker often supports more than eight family\nmembers, some of whom do not have any other means of subsistence. The social disruption will\nhave an immediate adverse effect on the creditworthiness and credibility of the Government.\nThe Program loan will help avoid such a crisis.", "30\n119. The overall design of the program will not have any obvious direct impact on the poor as\na separate group. The policy actions and conditions are designed to have broad effects across\nthe whole community; however, in the design of the conditions, special consideration has  been\ngiven to the possible impact on the poor to avoid negative impacts. For example, in minimizing\nsubsidies on copra, consideration will be given to alternative means of maintaining incomes of\ncopra growers in outer islands. Changes in the income  tax system proposed under the Program\nwill benefit lower income groups and mitigate the impact of increase in import duties and other\ntaxes. Positive benefits will primarily be in the form of an improved \u201cenabling environment\u201d for\nproductive investment. The improved governance, as a result of changes in public sector and\nfinancial management, is expected to encourage increased levels of investment. This will be\nfurther underpinned by improved access to micro-credit for the low income groups. In addition,\ngreater certainty in fiscal outcomes will ensure cuts to essential pro-poor services, such as\ncopra purchases and primary health care are avoided.\nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures\n120. The main risks in program implementation and the mitigating measures to manage the\nrisks are presented below.\n121. Inadequate Political Commitment. The most serious risk arises from the possible\nweakening  of  political  commitment  to  reforms.  This  issue  becomes  particularly  important\nbecause  ADB\u2019s  earlier  program  loan  to  the  RMI  (PSRP)  had  only  partial  success.  After\ndiscussion during the Appraisal Mission, it was concluded that there are at least three reasons\nwhy the chances of success are better this time.\n(i)  One key reason for the limited success of the PSRP was that very soon after its\ninception, it lost the main champion of reform \u2013 President Amata Kabua \u2013 and\nthe Government that followed was inclined to populist policies to continue in\npower. The victory in the last elections of the reform-minded Government of\nPresident Note gives the new Government a powerful mandate and responsibility\nfor reforms. The new Government has made an explicit commitment to reform of\nthe economy, transparency in government, stringent anticorruption measures,\nand strict enforcement of the law. It has brought back into the Government\nseveral  key  advisers  that  had  supported  the  late  President  Kabua\u2019s  reform\nprogram.  President  Note  himself  has  publicly  expressed  his  commitment  to\nreforms and has personally reiterated this commitment to ADB. To mitigate this\nrisk, it is envisaged that the major reform measures will be supported by acts of\nParliament, making reversals more difficult. Emphasis is also put on institutional\nreform  in  mechanisms  and  working  procedures  of  MOF  and  Government  in\ngeneral to maintain the discipline envisaged under the program.\n(ii)  Both the Government and the public are now worried about the consequences of\ncontinuing  along  the  past  lines  and  not  introducing  structural  reforms.  The\nanalysis by the US General Accounting Office of the inefficiencies in the use of\nCompact funds in the past and the publicity surrounding the report have driven\nhome  the  point  that  unless  reforms  are  introduced,  there  will  be  adverse\nconsequences on the size and flexibility in the use of future Compact funding.\nThere is also widespread fear that the per capita income of the county may\ndecline  severely  over  the  long  term  if  reforms  are  not  initiated.  Even  more\nimportantly,  the  sharp  increase  in  youth  unemployment  and  emergence  of", "31\npockets of vagrancy and poverty have instilled fear in the society that without\nreforms the country may lose its cherished traditions of good law and order and\ndemocracy.  Intensive  consensus  building  has  ensured  that  not  just  the\nGovernment but various other stakeholders feel a sense of ownership for the\nProgram.\n(iii)  The Government now sees more clearly the role of multilateral institutions in\nhelping to design and implement needed reforms. The Government sees the\npolicy matrix not as an external imposition, but as a checklist for its own reform\nprogram and as an instrument to sustain the political will to implement these\nreforms.  The  Government  believes  that  it  is  politically  more  feasible  and\npractically  more  effective  to  have  conditionalities  proposed  by  multilateral\ninstitutions than by bilateral agencies. By entering into agreements on tough and\ncredible reforms with ADB, the Government believes it will be able to reduce the\nneed for politically unacceptable conditionalities in Compact negotiations and\nimprove its public sector to levels now being required by US negotiators. The\ninformal support given by US authorities to the program loan and its implicit link\nto Compact negotiations help to mitigate the risk of slippages on the program of\nreforms.\n122. Despite these mitigating factors, it must be recognized that the extensive changes the\nprogram  envisages  cannot  be  brought  about  in  the  short  term.  Sustained  effort  by  the\nGovernment over a long period and sustained external support for the Program beyond the\ncurrent loan will be needed. The three-tranche method as well as the conditionalities expected\nto be required under the new Compact will help sustain the reform initiatives.\n123. National Capacity Constraints. To enhance the institutional capacity to implement the\nreforms,  skill  formation  and  an  associated  TA  are  provided.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  continued\nsupport through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre and projects in health and\neducation sectors will help in implementing the Program. It is also expected that when young\nUS-trained  graduates  join  the  Government,  the  national  capacity  for  sound  economic\nmanagement will improve. Building on the lessons of the past, ADB will make extra efforts to\nensure the high quality of experts mobilized under its TA program. In addition, special Compact\nfunding may be set aside for TA in capacity building, allowing funds to be used to finance\nconsultants in line position until counterpart staff are ready to take over.\n124. Resource Constraints. Another risk is that adequate financial resources will not be\navailable to meet the program needs. In this connection, the most serious risk relates to the\noutcome of Compact negotiations. If Compact funding for the future is substantially less than the\ncurrent levels, Government will need to further reduce expenditures and exert greater efforts at\nresource mobilization. The program loan articulating the Government\u2019s determination to use\nCompact resources more effectively than in the past is itself a factor that can mitigate the risk of\nsubstantial reduction in Compact funding.\n125. Less-Than Expected Financial Returns on MIITF. If the rates of return assumed on\nthe MIITF are not realized, the long-term objective of sustaining income levels even without\nCompact funding will not be achieved. The rate of return on the MIITF was assumed to be 5\npercent. That is a conservative assumption considering the performance of privately managed\nfunds such as pension funds in the US over the long term. To mitigate the risk, an external\nadvisory board will approve investment guidelines and professional fund managers will be hired\non a competitive basis.", "32\nIX.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances/Tranche Release Conditions\n126. The Government has assured ADB that, in addition to the conditions for the second and\nthird tranche releases, as described in Appendix 8, and the standard assurances, (i) the policies\nadopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreements, as described in the\ndevelopment policy letter of the Government dated 8 March 2001 and the policy matrix, will\ncontinue in effect for the duration of the program period, and (ii) the Government will adopt and\nimplement the other policies and take the other actions included in the program, as described in\nthe policy matrix.\n127. It  was  also  agreed  that  the  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  their  dialogue  on\nproblems  and  constraints  encountered  during  the  implementation  of  the  program.  The\nGovernment has assured that it will keep ADB informed of policy discussions concerning the\nprogram undertaken with other international and bilateral agencies (especially the US in relation\nto the Compact negotiations) as ADB may reasonably request, and will provide ADB with the\nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals.\nB.  Conditions of Loans Effectiveness\n128. In addition to the standard conditions of loans effectiveness, the establishment of the\nPSC  and  the  PCU,  headed  by  a  program  coordinator  and  staffed  with  an  administrative\nassistant/accountant will be conditions for the effectiveness of the loans.\nX.  RECOMMENDATION\n129. I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve:\n(i)  the loan of $4,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to the Republic of\nthe Marshall Islands for the Fiscal and Financial Management Program with a\nterm of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, and with interest to be\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system\nfor US dollar loans and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the\nBoard, and\n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 6,320,000 to\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Fiscal and Financial Management\nProgram, with a term of 24 years including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period, and\n1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are\nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement\npresented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\n     President\n11 May 2001", "33\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Development Policy Letter 34 22, 13\n2 Policy Matrix 40 62, 23\n3 Strengthening Public Sector Financial Management 51 68, 25\n4 Improving Coordination of Economic Policy 53 75, 26\n5 Poverty Impact Assessment 56 94, 30\n6 Long-Term Cash Flow Forecast 63 100, 39\n7 Program Framework 64 101, 39\n8 Ineligible Items 71 104, 39\n9 Conditions for Tranche Releases 72 111, 34\n10 Technical  Assistance  for  Fiscal,  Financial,  and 75 114, 35\nEconomic Advisory Services and Terms of Reference", "34\nAppendix 1 , page 1\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER", "35\nAppendix 1 , page 2", "36\nAppendix 1 , page 3", "37\nAppendix 1 , page 4", "38\nAppendix 1 , page 5", "39\nAppendix 1 , page 6", "POLICY MATRIX\nOverall Objective 1: To Ensure a Sustainable Income Flow for Future Generations\nIntermediate Objectives Specific Policy Actions Target Date for Responsibility/ Monitoring\nCompletion Resource Mechanism\n1.1 Strengthen 1.1.1  Publish the statutes of the MIITF and/or May 2001 Cabinet/Ministry The statutes and\ngovernance of the regulations  or  guidelines  in  relation  to (1st tranche of Finance (MOF) guidelines of MIITF are\nMarshall Islands MIITF to ensure that the objectives as condition) (supported by published\nIntergenerational stipulated in para. 64 of the report and Asian\nTrust Fund (MIITF) recommendation  of  the  president  are Development\nmet.

The Government proposes to make strong and verifiable commitments to strengthening\npublic financial management as a condition of the loans. The following are recommendations of\nthe Government\u2019s Task Force on Accountability with inputs from the Pacific Financial Technical\nAssistance Centre (PFTAC). The aim is to establish clear and robust systems of annual and\nmedium-term budgeting, financial control, accounting, internal audit, and reporting to the Nitijela.\n(i) Annual budget document. Detailed estimates are to be presented to the Nitijela in\nsupport of the annual (and any other) appropriation bill. The estimates will be\npublicly available and will show in a clear format:\n(a)  total estimated revenue, expenditure, and expected overall balance;\n(b)  proposal to use any estimated surplus or finance any deficit;\n(c)  expected  sources  of  revenue,  with  reference  to  the  legislation\nempowering the collection;\n(d)  allocation of expenditure to heads, subheads, and items in sufficient detail\nto show clearly how public moneys are to be spent on which Government\npolicies and programs;\n(e)  against each head of expenditure, a summary of the policies, programs,\nand specific performance targets expected to be achieved during the\nbudget year;\n(f)  comparative revenue and expenditure for the current and previous fiscal\nyears;\n(g)  statements of opening and closing balances and flows of funds for all\npublic financial assets and liabilities, including trust and special funds, for\nthe last two fiscal years and the budget year; and\n(h)  statements of external aid programs, balances, proposed disbursements,\nand commitments.\n(ii) Medium-term  budget  framework  (MTBF).  The  annual  budget  estimates\npresented to the Nitijela are to be accompanied by an MTBF. The MTBF will\npresent a four-year statement of the Government budget, by main heads of\nrevenue,  expenditure,  and  financing,  organized  in  accordance  with  the\ngovernment finance statistics format. The first year of the framework will be the\ncurrent year, showing the latest revised estimates. The second year will be the\nyear for which the estimates are being submitted to the Nitijela for appropriation,\nand the allocations to heads will be as in the estimates. The third and fourth\nyears will show estimated revenues based on current policy, and the allocations\nof expenditure that would result from implementing of the policies and programs\napproved by the Cabinet. Allocations will refer to the appropriate passages in the\naccompanying economic policy statement (EPS).\n(iii) Financial  control.  Provisions  are  to  be  put  in  place  to  prevent  unauthorized\nexpenditure from the general fund and to limit expenditure from trust or special\nfunds to the unexpended balance of each fund. The power of the Government to\nauthorize expenditure in excess of the total appropriation through supplementary\nappropriation  bills  will  be  limited  to  a  specified  fraction  of  the  original\nappropriation, and restricted to urgent and unforeseen circumstances. The power\nof the minister to move funds within the estimates will likewise be strictly limited", "52\nAppendix 3, page 2\nand its exercise must be promptly reported to the Nitijela. Significant penalties\nwill be imposed for breach of these rules. Authority delegated to accounting\nofficers will be linked to strict reporting and sub-control requirements. For cash-\nflow reasons, the minister of finance will retain the power to restrict expenditure.\nBank accounts will be consolidated and control/recovery of imprest accounts\ntightened. The secretary for finance will control use of credit facilities. The Public\nAccounts Committee of the Nitijela is to be made effective as the principal forum\nof Government accountability to Parliament.\n(iv) Accounting. The accounting system will be overhauled/replaced. The existing\nsystem  is  not  efficient,  and  its  output  requires  costly  on-site  support  by  its\ninstaller  (a  foreign  contractor).  Daily  position  statements,  weekly  cash  flow\nanalysis and monthly statements of account to the minister are to be established,\nleading to semiannual statements to the Nitijela comprehensively setting out the\nGovernment\u2019s financial position. Accounting officers will be required to reconcile\ntheir accounting records with the central Government accounts at least monthly.\n(v)  Reporting. A comprehensive structure of reporting will be put in place, designed\nto  take  up  minimum  time  in  preparing  reports  but  detecting  and  requiring\nexplanation for any significant divergences from the budget, and culminating in\nan annual report to the Nitijela by the secretary for finance (who is the top civil\nservant in the ministry).", "53\nAppendix 4, page 1\nIMPROVING COORDINATION OF ECONOMIC POLICY\nA.

Introduction\n1.  The reforms proposed under the Fiscal and Financial Management Program (FFMP) will\nprovide the basis for long-term pro-poor growth in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) by\nstabilizing the Government\u2019s fiscal position and establishing mechanisms within the financial\nsector to ensure access to credit for those most in need. The major components of the program\ninclude  stabilizing  the  fiscal  situation  of  the  RMI  Government,  strengthening  budget\nmanagement, developing a fiscal stabilization trust fund, improving the effectiveness of the\npublic service, and enhancing the policy environment for the private sector. The strategies\nproposed in the FFMP reflect the recommendations flowing from the Meto 2000 (TA 3284-RMI)\nand preliminary findings of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) work on Poverty Reduction\nStrategies for the Pacific developing member countries (PDMC) (RETA 5907).\n2.  In the past, poverty was not seen as a significant issue in the RMI. While inequalities\nexist between those living in the urban areas and those on the outer islands, the general\nperception has been that the people of the RMI had a reasonable standard of living. The\nperception has been perpetuated by the use of the GDP per capita measure to indicate the\ngeneral welfare in the community. The figures for the RMI indicate that the RMI is relatively\nbetter off than other PDMCs, while not allowing for distributional disparities. The perception that\nthe RMI has a reasonable standard of living does not fully accord with statistical data, which\nshows the RMI ranking 8th among the PDMCs in terms of the United Nations Development\nProgramme\u2019s (UNDP) human development index (HDI) and human poverty index (HPI) indices.\nThis must be viewed as a disappointing result, given the level of income enjoyed for much of the\npast 15 years. Of more immediate concern are the medium- to long-term prospects. If the\nCompact of Free Association (Compact) is renewed with far less advantageous terms, income\nlevels will plummet and many people are likely to be forced into poverty. The FFMP loan\nassistance aims to put in place assistance to minimize this possibility.\n3.  Although there is no agreed upon definition of poverty as it relates to the RMI, evidence\nfrom  statistical  sources  and  anecdotal  evidence  indicate  huge  disparities  in  cash  income\navailable to communities. This is most obvious in the rural-urban dichotomy, with the 1999\ncensus data shown in Figure A1 indicating that households in urban areas have vastly greater\nincomes than those in rural areas. This situation is also skewed by the existence of pockets of\nthe population who are in receipt of substantial compensation payments as a result of the\nnuclear testing carried out by the United States (US) after World War II.\n4.  The RMI is a highly urbanized society with over 65 percent of the population residing in\nthe urban centers of Majuro and Ebeye. Although urban households may have higher incomes\nin  many  cases,  the  number  of  persons  per  household  will  offset  this  to  some  extent.\nSubstantially lower income levels in rural areas are partially offset by access to the subsistence\nsafety net. This observation has been reinforced by the physical evidence of distinct pockets of\nurban poverty in Majuro and Ebeye. This assessment will distinguish between rural and urban\nimpacts.", "57\nAppendix 5, page 2\nFigure A1: Median Household Income, 1999\n16,000\n14,000\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n0\nAilinglaplap Ailuk Arno Aur EbonEnewetak Jabat JaluitKili (Bikini)ein (Ebeye) Lae Lib Likiep Majuro Maloelap Mejit MiliNamdrik Namu Ujae Utrik Wotho Wotje\nal\naj\nw\nSource: 1999 RMI Census of Population and HousKing\n5.  As discussed in paragraphs 20-24, there will be positive and negative impacts on the\npoor. However, there are likely to be indirect and long-term effects. Negative effects can be\nmitigated  by  careful  design  of  the  various  policy  actions  envisaged  and  also  by  careful\nconsideration of the terms of reference of the various reviews to be undertaken. Without reform,\nthe effects on the poor could be severe and long-term.\n6.  No direct mitigating effects are included in the FFMP; however, indirect effects will be\nevident. Government services will be maintained in key social sectors to mitigate the regressive\nnature of tax changes. Careful design and protecting transfer payments and subsidies (e.g.,\ncopra and outer island shipping) to the less well-off will provide a safety net for the poor.\nB. Measuring Impacts of Reform under the FFMP\n7.  The overall design of the FFMP will not have any obvious direct impact on the poor as a\nseparate group. The policy actions and conditions are designed to have broad effects across\nthe whole community, however, in the design of the conditions special consideration was given\nto avoid possible negative impacts on the poor. For example, income tax relief to low-income\nearners will offset the regressive impact of increased import duties. Subsidies will be minimized,\nbut justifiable subsidies such as to the copra industry will be considered.\n8.  Even with the best design, it may be impossible to avoid effects on the poorest sections\nof the community. Although the fiscal stabilization actions will have indirect effects due to\nchanges in prices of goods bought and sold by the poor, such effects will be impossible to\ndirectly measure in advance. Increased pressure on Government services will affect the poor,\nbut the program loan aims to avoid collapse of the most sensitive service delivery areas, which\nis likely without program assistance.", "58\nAppendix 5, page 3\nC. Methodology\n9.  ADB\u2019s methodology for social impact assessment of program loans notes that analyzing\nthe specific impact of program loans and specific policy actions on economic conditions is\ndifficult. Social impact, and therefore the impact on the poor, reflects the economic impact. No\nspecific  indications  or  measures  quantify  the  impact  of  reforms  on  specific  groups  in  the\ncommunity.  However,  the  FFMP  recommends  the  establishment  of  the  Economic  Policy,\nPlanning and Statistics Office (EPPSO), which will be responsible for monitoring the poverty\nimpacts of the FFMP.\n10.  The methodology to be used in assessing the impact of the FFMP follows ADB\u2019s agreed-\nupon  methodology.  Three  scenarios  are  presented.  Scenario  1  assumes  that  none  of  the\nrecommended reforms under the FFMP are implemented. The result will likely be the collapse\nof the Government\u2019s essential public services that currently form a social safety net to the poor.\nThis could force the Government into commercial borrowing to fund its short-term cash flow and\nperpetuating recent imprudent financial practices. The lack of reform measures will limit the\nability of the Government to use the renegotiated economic provisions of the Compact most\neffectively.\n11.  Scenario 2 assumes that the Government will implement reforms under the FFMP, but\nwithout external financial support. Given the lag period involved in the effect of some of the\nreforms and the seriousness of the short-term cash flow situation, the Government is still likely\nto experience a collapse of social services in the short term. In the long term, the reforms will\nhave a positive effect on the ability of the Government to use the assistance forthcoming from\nthe  Compact  renegotiations  to  support  pro-poor  growth.  This  positive  impact  will  only  be\napparent after significant pain and a long adjustment period.\n12.  Scenario 3 envisages that the Government will undertake reforms supported by the\nFFMP loan. This assistance will support the Government\u2019s public services in the short term and\navoid collapse of the social safety net by stabilizing the fiscal situation and then establishing\nsustainable  revenue  prospects.  Fiscal  policies  will  be  a  tightened  and  spending  priorities\nrationalized, which will involve a short to medium-term adjustment period. The implementation\nof reforms will have a positive impact on the ability of the RMI to use funds forthcoming from the\nrenewed economic provisions of the Compact.\n13.  The  impact  of  the  FFMP  is  considered  from  four  perspectives  through  which  the\nscenarios will affect the poor: (i) demand for unskilled labor, (ii) the prices of the goods bought\nand sold by the poor, (iii) public transfers (transfers minus taxes) to the poor, and (iv) access to\npublic  and  rationed  goods  and  services.  The  impacts  will  then  be  grouped  under  four\ncategories: (i) direct effects, (ii) indirect effects, (iii) macroeconomic effects, and (iv) effects on\nvulnerable urban groups (VUG) who may become poor due to the project effects.\n14.  If we look at the poor as largely rural, then the impact of the FFMP is likely to be minor\ngiven that the poor survive largely on a subsistence basis. The one exception is the only cash\ncrop on the islands, copra, which the Government heavily subsidizes. In addition, education and\nhealth services to the rural areas are rudimentary, but fiscal problems will likely have an effect.\nThe effect in the urban areas is likely to be greater, but just as difficult to identify.", "59\nAppendix 5, page 4\nD.  Policy Actions with Significant Impact on the Poor\n15.  As noted in para. 7 the policy actions of the FFMP appear to have little direct impact\non the poor. They will, however, alleviate the impacts on the poor of the no-reform scenario and\nestablish the foundation for long-term pro-poor growth. The indirect effects will be spread across\nthe whole program and will be examined in the context of the scenarios proposed earlier.\nE.  Three Scenarios\n1.  Scenario 1: No Reform\n16.  In this scenario, the Government public services will collapse with the inability to meet\npayroll  and  other  existing  financial  obligations.  Compact  receipts  coming  from  a  two-year\nextension of the existing economic provisions may alleviate the problems in the medium term,\nbut prospects for long-term growth will still be poor.1 The funds will become available, as\nprevious  transfers  that  have  been  consumed  by  debt  servicing  requirements  will  finish  in\nOctober. When the funds become available, it is likely that expenditure levels would return to\nprevious levels, although, given the fiscal record of the RMI, the prospects of this money leading\nto substantial development are not good.\na.  Direct Impact\n17.  With no reform there will be severe impacts on the poor, as public services are likely to\ncollapse in the short term. Prospects for unskilled labor to secure employment will diminish as\nGovernment expenditures come under immediate pressure. Effects on the rural poor will not be\ntangible since they operate largely outside the cash economy. The major exception is the cash\nreceived from production of copra, which is heavily subsidized by the Government in the form of\nan artificially high purchase price. Already the rural areas are feeling the impacts, since the\nsubsidized copra price has been lowered twice in the past six months. Since copra is the one\nsignificant cash-generating activity on the outer islands, cash incomes for those living in the\nrural areas will be significantly reduced. Additionally, transfers to local governments will possibly\nbe affected although these are not significant items in the Government budget except for the\nKwajalein local government (Ebeye).\n18.  The possibility of severe disruption to public services will affect the urban poor in a\nnumber of ways. Most notably services will be lacking as the Government restricts its services\nbecause of its cash flow problems. The possibility of the Government failing to meet its payroll\nwill have a severe effect in households with single wage earners. Many public service wage\nearners also have sizable personal loans to service, so the possibility of a payroll disruption will\nhave a compounding effect on the poorest households as debt accumulates.\nb. Indirect Impact\n19.  The indirect impacts are longer term, but the outlook for unskilled labor in the longer\nterm is poor given the long-term revenue prospects of the Government. Unskilled labor will find\nit  more  difficult  to  secure  work  as  the  services  sector  suffers  from  reduced  Government\nexpenditure. Prospects for transfers to the poorer members of the community will be dim given\n                                                          \n1  The  Compact  provides  for  a  temporary  two-year  extension  of  the  economic  provisions  of  the  Compact  if\nnegotiations on renewal of these provisions are not completed. Formal negotiations have yet to commence and are\nlikely to be lengthy, meaning that the likelihood of an extension is extremely high. A view is that the Compact funds\nare only available for capital and not recurrent expenditure, but the veracity of this information is unconfirmed.", "60\nAppendix 5, page 5\nthat there is unlikely to be any improvement in the utilization of Compact funds. The economy is\nlikely to remain relatively stagnant in the foreseeable future, with little likelihood of increased\nself-reliance.\nc. Macroeconomic Impact\n20.  As  Government  financial  reserves  are  already  exhausted,  there  are  no  additional\nresources to draw upon to fund deficits. Contracting Government expenditure will impact on\nrecurrent expenditures and hence the private sector. Prospects for unskilled labor will continue\nto deteriorate along with Government services. Increased Government borrowing to fund cash\nflow will exacerbate the lack of reserves and lead to a debt spiral as discretionary revenues\nhave to be increasingly dedicated to debt servicing. Lack of social services can lead to social\ninstability as unemployment increases with the flow-on effect from the lack of Government\nexpenditure having a cumulative effect throughout the economy.\nd.  Impact on the Vulnerable Urban Groups\n21.  With no reform, the deterioration of public services will impact on vulnerable urban\ngroups,  considering  vulnerable  urban  groups  are  predominantly  urban.  Just  like  the  poor,\nvulnerable urban groups will feel the effects but will be able to offset the negative impact to\nsome extent. Being predominantly urban gives vulnerable urban groups greater access to the\nmigration option, through access to the US granted under the Compact. One apparent impact of\nthe reduction-in-force program was the increase in out-migration to the US as staff reductions\ntook place and the economy contracted. This option was open to the vulnerable urban groups\nbut of course was not available to the poorest in the community. Many of the vulnerable urban\ngroups  who  migrated  have  apparently  taken  up  unskilled  work  in  the  US.  If  Government\nfinances continue to deteriorate and expenditures restricted ,then retrenchments in the private\nsector  are  likely  to  occur  resulting  in  vulnerable  urban  groups  income  earners  becoming\nunemployed and entering the realm of the poor. Migration will be a major option.\n2. Scenario 2: Reform Without Program Loan\n \na. Direct Impact\n22.  The  dire  fiscal  situation  of  the  Government\u2019s  finances  means  that  reform  without\nassistance from the program loan will cause significant problems, as in Scenario 1. The impacts\non the poor will result from the collapse of health and education services (para. 17). The rural\npoor  will  continue  to  suffer  in  the  short  term,  experience  indicating  that  in  times  of  fiscal\nproblems, resources are more tightly concentrated in urban centers. But, as noted in para. 14,\ndeterioration  cannot  reduce  services  much  on  the  outer  islands  because  of  their  current\nrudimentary state.\n23.  The urban poor are likely to suffer more than the rural poor in both a relative and\nabsolute sense as services cease or salaries are unpaid. Unlike in the PSRP, the loss of jobs\nand salaries is unlikely to be permanent, although hardship will be severe in the short to\nmedium term. However, the urban poor will also benefit earlier from the recovery as the reforms\nbegin  to  yield  results  and  improvements  from  Compact  assistance  spread  through  the\ncommunities. Little of these benefits will accrue to the outer islands in the medium term until\nbetter mechanisms are developed to distribute wealth more equitably and efficiently.", "61\nAppendix 5, page 6\nb. Indirect Impact\n24.  Without assistance, the Government cannot avoid the reality of a short-term budget\ncrunch. Labor markets, especially for unskilled labor, will be depressed in the short to medium\nterm, but after a painful adjustment period prospects will brighten. There is also less likelihood\nthat the reforms will be adopted quickly. The considerable pain can lead to backtracking on\nreforms without including mitigating measures. Without the accompanying technical assistance\nfor policy reform, implementation lags and policy errors can delay the recovery and exacerbate\nproblems in the economy. There will be little prospect for maintaining transfers in the short term,\nincluding subsidies to the outer islands. In the medium term, services will stagnate but possibly\nimprove in the longer term.\nc. Macroeconomic Impact\n25.  The contraction of the Government\u2019s budget will limit the ability of the private sector to\ndrive any sort of employment growth. Job prospects especially for the unskilled will remain\nbleak.  Prices  will  probably  increase  as  the  private  sector  contracts,  resulting  in  reduced\ncompetition. This may be partially offset by downward pressure on wages, the major input into\nprices in the RMI. Restricted public transfers in line with the Government\u2019s tight budgetary\nsituation can lead to social and economic instability. This can be exacerbated by poor social\nservices to provide the necessary safety net. Prospects in the longer term will improve after a\npainful adjustment period.\nd.  Impact on Vulnerable urban groups\n26.  As the Government services reach crisis, vulnerable urban groups will possibly lose jobs\nor at least experience problems when the Government cannot meet its payroll obligations. Job\nprospects are likely to be severely curtailed for both skilled and semiskilled workers. Prices will\nbe affected by increases in import duties as the Government tries to shore up its revenue.\nHowever, with a weak labor market, there could be downward pressure on wages. There will be\nincreased pressure on public services and vulnerable urban groups will suffer as the services\ndeteriorate and possibly become more expensive.\n3. Scenario 3: Reforms with Program Loan\n27.  The  goal  of  the  FFMP  is  to  stabilize  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position  and  thereby\nstabilize the overall economy. The assistance should alleviate the current crisis by increasing\nGovernment revenues to sustainable levels while maintaining the social safety net for the poor.\nThe scale of the problems facing the Government will cause a downturn in the economy, but it\nwill be followed by significantly improved prospects in the medium to long term. The assistance\nshould prevent job losses and set the path for moderate employment growth.\na. Direct Impact\n28.  The assistance should at least maintain existing employment without the need for any\nretrenchments in the Government. Tightening of fiscal policy will probably put pressure on\ncertain private sector operators and result in some private sector layoffs, but these should be\nminimized. As import duties are increased, minor increase in prices should be partially offset by\ncompensating income tax relief for low-income earners. There is little prospect in the medium\nterm of the Government\u2019s finances being able to cope with increases in the copra-buying price\ndespite the political nature of the subsidy. Public transfers and essential government services", "62\nAppendix 5, page 7\nshould be maintained; however, these transfers and nonessential services are likely to be\nrationalized as the Government refines its spending priorities.\nb. Indirect Impact\n29.  In the medium term, it is expected that improvements to the policy environment in the\nprivate sector combined with a more disciplined fiscal policy can lead to moderate employment\ngrowth for unskilled labor. Minor price rises can impact on people with fixed incomes such as\nretirees  and  those  that  receive  nuclear  compensation  payments.  Public  transfers  will  be\nrationalized, but stabilization of the Government\u2019s fiscal position may allow the Government to\nbe more sympathetic to consideration of pro-poor transfer payments such as to the outer\nislands.  Additional  privatization,  corporatization,  and  contracting  out  can  restrict  directly\nprovided government services, but there could be efficiency gains with the private sector taking\nover some of these services, and assuming that institutional capacity exists in the public service\nto oversee contracts.\nC. Macroeconomic Impact\n30.  Adjustment in the fiscal policy with the review of the taxation systems to make it more\nprogressive without negative impacts on private sector incentives should support employment\ngrowth at a moderate level. The key will be to ensure that the review of the tax regime promotes\nthe private sector and maintains incentives. The proposed increases in import duties will have\nsome effect on prices, and the private sector passes changes in the tax structures on to the\nconsumers in the form of higher prices. Promoting a competition policy can assist in minimizing\nprice increases from tax changes. Fiscal balance should also allow public transfers to continue\nto the most needy, with some justifiable rationalization based on transferring wealth to those\nmost  in  need.  Additionally,  the  fiscal  balance  should  ensure  that  essential  services  are\nmaintained at levels to support the poor.\nd. Impact on Vulnerable urban groups\n31.  The vulnerable urban groups should be able to maintain their employment, though there\nmay be some layoffs in the private sector from the flow-on effect as the Government rationalizes\nits spending patterns. Vulnerable urban groups will experience increases in prices, but the lower\nincome  earners  will  experience  tax  relief.  Public  transfers  to  vulnerable  urban  groups  will\nprobably decrease with the rationalization of these transfers, but vulnerable urban groups will\nbenefit from the continuation of essential social services such as education and health even\nthough some more peripheral services may be terminated.", "LONG-TERM CASH FLOW FORECAST\n($ million)\nItem 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Total\nA.
