INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Kiribati expressed a need for technical assistance (TA) on public \nfinancial management (PFM) in 2010 to address priority weaknesses identified through the public \nexpenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment.1 Based on the assessment and with \nthe assistance of the European Union, the government developed a draft PFM plan to provide \ncoherent and coordinated guidance on reform activities. The PFM plan indicated three priority \nareas: (i) improving accounting practices, (ii) strengthening revenue management and policy, and \n(iii)  building  capacity  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Development  (MFED). \nDiscussion between the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the government, and development \npartners  determined  that  a  focus  by  ADB  on  improving  accounting  practices  through  an \nintegrated capacity building program would complement  the ongoing ADB TA for Economic \nManagement and Public Sector Reform.2  \n \n2.  A  TA  fact-finding  mission  visited  Kiribati  on  24  May\u20132  June  2011.  It  reached  an \nunderstanding  in  discussions  with  the  government  and  other  stakeholders  on  the  impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consulting services. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  After 2 years of contraction, the Kiribati economy recovered in 2010, growing by 1.75%, \nmainly as a result of an increase in public sector spending and increased private sector activities, \nespecially in construction and retailing. Growth in the near term is expected to strengthen to 3% \nas donor-supported capital works construction (rehabilitation of the Tarawa road, and upgrades to \nthe airport and port) gets underway. While the medium-term prospects look balanced due to \npublic works that are in the pipeline, long-term challenges remain.   \n \n4.  The government\u2019s recurrent and development expenditures are the main determinant of \naggregate demand and in 2010 represented 63% of gross national income. The government is \nalso the main employer. While fiscal policy has helped maintain household-level output during the \nrecent global economic downturn through increased public service salaries and copra subsidies, \nthere is a need for fiscal consolidation. The revenue base is very volatile and the only cushion \nagainst  fiscal  shock  is  the  country\u2019s  wealth  fund\u2014the  Revenue  Equalization  Reserve  Fund \n(RERF). However, the RERF has suffered substantial loss: it declined in value from A$637 million \nin 2007 to A$571 million in 2009 due to investment losses and drawdowns (averaging 12% of \ngross domestic product over the last 10 years) to finance budget deficits. There is concern that if \nthis trend continues, the RERF real per capita balance would reach one-third of its 2000 value by \n2030.4 \n \n5.  To strengthen the country\u2019s fiscal position, unnecessary expenditures must be reduced, \nwhich is in line with the Kiribati Development Plan (KDP) 2008\u20132011 goal of improving the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal position. To achieve this, the KDP calls for the government to commit to fiscal \nprudence,  refrain  from  unnecessary  overspending,  and  strengthen  PFM.  The  government \nrecognized and responded to the need for PFM reform, and in 2010 (with ADB assistance) \n                                                 \n1  The government conducted this PEFA with the assistance from the European Union in 2010. \n2  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kiribati for Economic Management and Public Sector Reform. \nManila (TA 7166-KIR, approved for $800,000 in November). The Government of Australia provided cofinancing of \n$1.5 million). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 July 2011. \n4  International Monetary Fund. 2011. Article IV Mission Report. Washington, DC. \n ", "2  \nadopted a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) and commenced implementation of a reform \nprogram for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that resulted in the sale of the Kiribati Supply \nCompany. Assistance to budget strengthening under the current TA will be completed in February \n2013, while the SOE component will continue through February 2014.  \n \n6.  An  MTFF  is  in  place  and  was  used  in  formulating  the  2011  budget.  MFED  is  also \nimproving national budget monitoring. A new national budget steering committee (made up of \nrepresentatives from the different ministries) and separate revenue and expenditure task forces \nhave been set up to review the 2011 budget figures, which will form the basis of the 2012 budget. \nDespite the progress made, the quality of the MTFF and the budget review work are dependent \non the quality of the financial data provided by the Accounting Department. Concerns have been \nraised\u2014by  the  PEFA  report,  and  Auditor  General\u2019s  report  on  the  most  recent  Government \nfinancial accounts\u2014regarding the reliability of the Accounting Department\u2019s financial figures. \n \n7.  The PEFA assessment indicated that PFM in Kiribati is weakened by a lack of fiscal \ndiscipline, and highlighted the lack of timely bank reconciliations, non-retirement of advances, \nlack of financial reconciliation between MFED and line ministries, poor quality of data, lack of \neffective expenditure commitment controls, and outdated legislation and regulations. In addition, \nthe Accounting Department lacks the capacity to make full use of the accounting functions of its \nAttach\u00e9 accounting package.  \n \n8.  The Attach\u00e9 accounting package was installed in the Accounting Department more than \n10 years ago and staff members that were initially trained to use the system have either retired or \nmoved on to other departments. The Attach\u00e9 system is currently used as a recording tool and not \nfor management or control (as was originally intended). Ministries also run their own parallel \naccounting systems, resulting in poor financial reconciliation. Initial investigation of the Attach\u00e9 \nsystem confirmed that there are a number of features (modules) that could be used to perform \nthese management and control functions. In the beginning of 2011, the European Union funded a \n2-week training on use of the Attach\u00e9 system, which has resulted in notable improvements. \nTraining staff to fully understand and use Attach\u00e9 can bring about significant benefits.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be to strengthen fiscal discipline and resource allocation. The impact will \nbe monitored through demonstrated improvements in the 2014 country performance assessment \non the ratings for macroeconomic management and fiscal policy. The outcome will be enhanced \nbudget management and monitoring in MFED. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA supports the government\u2019s strategies to (i) demonstrate commitment to fiscal \nprudence  and  refrain  from  unnecessary  overspending;  and  (ii)  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement, as set out in the KDP 2008\u20132011, through three outputs. \n \n11.  Output 1. Output 1 seeks to build the effectiveness and efficiency of MFED. Based on the \nMFED capacity assessment carried out under the ongoing TA (footnote 2), this output supports \nthe formulation and the implementation of an institutional strengthening program in MFED. The \nprogram  will  consider  the  current  MFED  structure,  job  descriptions  and  on-the-job-training \nrequirements in light of MFED\u2019s role in supporting PFM. The program will focus on strengthening \n ", "  3\nthe  Budget  Department  in  the  National  Economic  and  Planning  Office  (NEPO)  and  the \nAccounting Department. Recognizing the risk of staff turnover, the program will also identify a \nsmall  team  from  NEPO  and  the  Accounting Department,  which  will  be  trained  on  the  core \nfunctions of the two departments. Having such a team in NEPO and the Accounting Department \nwill ensure sustainability of capacity-building efforts and continuity within MFED. TA funds will \nfocus primarily on building capacity on the job, with direct assistance from the TA consultants. \n \n12.  Output  2.  Output  2  focuses  on  strengthened  budget  management,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation through strengthening of financial reporting between line ministries and MFED. The TA \nconsultants  will  work  closely  with  the  Budget  Division,  the  Accounting  Department,  and \naccountants in line ministries to develop tools and procedures to improve financial reporting. \nCommitment  recording  will  be  introduced  to  improve  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  budget \nperformance, and the fund control features in the Attach\u00e9 system will be developed to prevent \nexpenditures and commitments from exceeding appropriations. The TA team will work closely \nwith the government\u2019s revenue and expenditure committees to monitor and evaluate budget \nperformance. This output will also ensure better linkages between the MTFF and the new national \ndevelopment strategy being developed by the government. \n \n13.  Output 3. Output 3 focuses on strengthened capacity in the Accounting Department. \nImproving staff capacity in the Accounting Department in MFED is vital to support ongoing and \nfuture PFM reform programs. The TA will focus on the implementation of a training program for \nstaff from the Accounting Department, accountants from line ministries and staff from the Office of \nthe Auditor General on the basic functions of the Attach\u00e9 system. A more comprehensive training \non the Attach\u00e9 advanced functions will be conducted for an already identified core group from the \nAccounting  Department  to  enable  them  to  train  staff.  A  capacity-building  program  will  be \nimplemented to ensure that staff can resolve the issues highlighted by the auditor general in his \nprevious reports.  \n \n14.  This output will focus on (i) ensuring that staff can (a) use the Attach\u00e9 functions on fund \ncontrol (procedures to prevent\u00a0 expenditures or commitments from exceeding appropriations); \ncommitment control; automated reconciliation; and automated check writing (checks would be \nprinted by the system to ensure that amounts, recipients, and dates correspond to information in \nthe Attach\u00e9 system); and (b) produce regular reports arraying data according to government \nfinance statistics reporting categories of the International Monetary Fund and such other reports \nas  may  be  required  for  the  preparation  of  financial  statements;  (ii)  producing  and  storing \nelectronic  copies  of  transaction  documentation  for  each  transaction  in  Attach\u00e9;  and  (iii) \nredesigning Attach\u00e9 screens for greater similarity and ease of use so that users see clearly how \nforms and screens relate. \n15.  A number of assumptions are important to the success of the TA. The government\u2019s \nsustained commitment to PFM reforms is key. The greatest risk to the success of the TA is failure \nto provide counterpart staff or retain key operational staff. To mitigate this, the TA will train a \nlarger pool of staff within MFED instead of focusing on smaller groups. A weakening of political \nsupport would place TA outcomes at risk. The TA success is also based on the assumption that \nthe government will improve internet connectivity between MFED and line ministries. However, if \nconnectivity issues are not resolved, the TA will ensure that the Attach\u00e9 is configured to allow \nfinancial transactions to be input while offline (this is included in the Attach\u00e9 specialist terms of \nreference). \n \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The government has requested ADB to finance $800,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  contribution  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, communications facilities for consultants, and other in-kind contributions. Details \nof the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MFED will be the executing agency, while implementing agencies will include MFED, line \nministries and the Office of the Auditor General. A TA focal point will be appointed under MFED to \noversee the activities of, and maintain an information exchange with, the consultant team. The \nconsultants and the TA focal point will also liaise with relevant development partner programs and \nprojects, so as to promote coordination and complementarity in activities. The government is \nplanning to form a PFM plan steering committee (comprised of representatives from the budget \nand accounting departments and the National Economic and Planning Office, chaired by the \nMFED secretary) to help coordinate PFM-related activities. To avoid duplication, the TA will use \nthis  committee  to  oversee  TA  implementation.  Training,  seminars,  and  conferences  will  be \nadministered by the TA team. \n18.  The TA will be implemented from 1 April 2012 to 30 April 2014 and is expected to finance \n21  person-months  of  intermittent  international  consulting  and  7  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services. The consultant team will have a (i) team leader and treasury specialist \n(international, 10 person-months); (ii) a budget specialist (international, 8 person-months); (iii) an \nAttach\u00e9 system specialist (international, 3 person-months); and (iv) a local facilitator (national, 7 \nperson-months). International consultants will be senior technical specialists in their fields with \nextensive  experience  in  small  island  states.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged \nthrough  a  firm  based  on  a  simplified  technical  proposal  under  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection process, using a 90:10 weighting for quality and cost. The consultants will be engaged \naccording to ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAppendix  3  gives  the  outline  terms  of  reference.  Proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \n \n19.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the duration of the TA, and a final report summarizing the achievements, issues, \nlessons, and next steps. Throughout the TA, the team leader will submit (by email) brief monthly \nprogress reports summarizing TA activities, progress, issues, and constraints. Team members \nwill produce inputs (reports) on their respective activities for the team leader's progress and final \nreports. The team leader's final report will be submitted in draft form at least 5 weeks prior to the \nend of the assignment, and the final report within 2 weeks of receipt of comments from the \ngovernment and ADB. \n \n20.  TA progress will be monitored using the intended outcomes and outputs described in the \ndesign and monitoring framework attached as Appendix 1. ADB will assist the government in \nsharing all reports with other development partners. Information will be disseminated through \nroundtable meetings, radio interviews, and the ADB website.  \n \n ", "  5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Kiribati for Strengthened Public Financial Management, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and    \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nStrengthened fiscal  Average 0.5 rating  2014 CPA exercise  Continued strong \ndiscipline and strategic  improvement by the  and 2013 PEFA  Government commitment to \nallocation of resources in  end of 2014 in the    strengthening public financial \nKiribati national budget  following CPA scores:    management \n  (i) A1: macroeconomic     \nmanagement (2010    Risk \nbaseline: 2.0) and;    Change in priorities following \n(ii) A2: fiscal policy    September 2011 elections \n(2010 baseline: 2.0).   \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced budget  Demonstrated    Government improves IT \nmanagement and  improvement by 2013    connectivity between line \nmonitoring in MFED  in:    ministries and MFED \n     \n(i) PEFA indicator PI-22  2013 PEFA   \n(timeliness and   \nregularity of accounts   \nreconciliation) equals   \nB+(2011 baseline: D)   \n   \n(ii) PEFA indicator PI- 2013 PEFA  \n25 (quality and   \ntimeliness of annual   \nfinancial statements)   \nequals B+ (2011   \nbaseline: D)   \n   \n(iii) PEFA indicator PI- Auditor General\u2019s \n24 dimension (quality of  report and 2013 \ninformation) equals A  PEFA \n(2011 baseline: D) \nOutputs           \n1.
