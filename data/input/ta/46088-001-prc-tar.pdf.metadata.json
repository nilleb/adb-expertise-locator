During the 2012 country programming review mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), through the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), requested \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help \nimprove the policy and management system for rural environmental protection. The TA was \nincluded in the PRC country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015.1 A reconnaissance mission \nwas  conducted  during  23\u201328  May  2013.  During  the  mission  and  subsequent  discussions, \nunderstandings  and  agreement  were  reached  on  the  project  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting  services,  as  recorded  in  a  memorandum  of  understanding.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Environmental degradation in rural areas of the PRC, which undermines the sustainable \ndevelopment of rural areas, has become a pressing issue. Pollution of surface water has been \nparticularly serious, resulting in a large percentage of the rural population being forced to rely on \nunsafe sources for drinking water. Because of their limited access to centralized water supply \nsystems, rural residents are highly vulnerable to the health hazards of water pollution. Of the \n409 sections of major rivers where water quality is monitored, 40.0% were found to have water \nquality that was unsafe for human consumption and 16.4% had water quality that was unsafe for \nany use.3 Major sources of water pollution in rural areas include agricultural runoff, untreated \nsewage, industrial and household solid waste, and livestock discharges from intensive animal \nhusbandry enterprises. In most small towns and villages, there are virtually no pollution control \nmeasures to deal with sewage and animal waste. As a result, large quantities of untreated \nwaste are discharged into the environment.   \n \n3.  Recognizing the serious status of the rural environment, the government has issued a \nnumber  of  policy  guidance  documents  and  devoted  significant  resources  to  deal  with  the \nchallenges. Under the Promoting Treatment through Incentives Program launched in 2008, the \ncentral government established special funds to supplement local government resources for \nimplementing  rural  environmental  improvement  projects.  The  government  is  committed  to \nimproving the rural environment, as reflected in the 12th Five-Year Plan. Protecting drinking \nwater sources is a key government priority, which contributes to reduced rural\u2013urban disparities \nand  improved  rural  livelihoods.  The  plan  emphasizes  strengthening  of  monitoring  and \nenforcement  of  water  quality  measures  and  raising  public  awareness.  It  also  addresses \ncentralized treatment of sewage and solid waste from rural areas near urban centers, and \nadoption of appropriate low-cost, low-maintenance technologies for small-scale treatment in \nremote rural areas. \n \n4.  Although the government has made some progress in improving the rural environment, \nthe challenges are daunting. Rural households are distributed over large geographical areas, \nmaking it difficult to achieve economies of scale in collection and treatment. Waste management \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 July 2013. \n3  According to the 2010 Annual Environmental Report published by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the \nwater quality of about 40.0% of the 409 sections was found to be grade IV, V, and V+, and 16.4% was V+. Water \nquality grades defined in the Environmental Water Quality Standard GB3838-2002 indicate that grade IV, V, and \nV+ are unsafe for human consumption and V+ is unsuitable for any use. \n ", "2   \ncosts  would  be  prohibitively  high  if  measures  were  patterned  on  urban  approaches.  The \nwidening gap in economic development between rural and urban areas has resulted in very \nlimited availability of resources in rural areas for investing in the infrastructure required to treat \nsewage  and  solid  wastes.  Further,  it  is  unlikely  that  user fees  could finance  the required \ninfrastructure, as rural households are relatively poor. Similarly, institutional capacity in rural \nareas for environmental monitoring and enforcement is weak. Public attitudes and individual \nbehavior of the rural population are also contributing factors to environmental deterioration. \nLittering  and  dumping  of  household  garbage  is  prevalent,  which  further  aggravates \nenvironmental problems in rural areas and reduces the effectiveness of measures to collect \ngarbage for centralized treatment. \n \n5.  To deal with these challenges, the government has requested that ADB provide TA to (i) \nreview the current status of sewage and household solid-waste management in rural areas of \nthe  PRC; (ii)  examine experiences  and  evidence  accumulated  in  developed  countries;  (iii) \nanalyze the feasibility and effectiveness of, and constraints on, various approaches to sewage \nand household solid-waste management in the PRC context, and recommend policy options \nand  programs  with  regard  to  the  above  findings;  and  (iv)  prepare  a  knowledge  product \nsummarizing the findings.     \n \n6.  ADB has supported two TA projects\u2014in 2002 and 2011\u2014to help the MEP develop \nregulations on rural pollution prevention. The two TA projects focused on nonpoint source \npollution  from  agricultural  and  animal  husbandry  sources,  and  included  development  of  a \npollution management framework and medium-term action plans for addressing rural nonpoint \nsource pollution.4 In addition, ADB has supported a number of TA projects\u2014e.g., in Anhui and \nGuangdong  provinces\u2014to  help  formulate  provincial  development  strategies  for  rural \nenvironmental protection and to develop waste management capacity in small cities and towns \nthat  include  service  for  nearby  rural  areas.5 The  TA  will  build  on  and  contribute  to  the \nachievements of past and ongoing TA projects and focus on the management of sewage and \nhousehold solid waste in support of the MEP\u2019s efforts to improve the rural environment.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  of  the  TA  is  an  improved  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  rural \nenvironmental protection infrastructure in the PRC. The outcome of the TA will be an improved \nmanagement framework for sewage and household solid-waste management in rural areas.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will focus on addressing aspects of the management framework for sewage and \nsolid-waste treatment that can benefit from adoption of international experiences and best \npractices. The review of international experience and best practices will follow a case study \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2002.

Output  1:  A  background  review  of  the  current  status  of  rural  sewage  and \nhousehold solid-waste management in the People\u2019s Republic of China conducted. The \nreview will (i) focus on summarizing current technologies, policies, institutional arrangements, \nincentive frameworks, and financing and public awareness measures; and (ii) identify areas \nwhere improvement is needed. \n \n10.  Output 2: A review of international experiences in rural sewage and household \nsolid-waste management conducted. The review will include experiences and in-depth case \nstudies of rural sewage and household solid-waste management in Japan; the Republic of \nKorea; Taipei,China; the United States; and Germany. A summary of international experience \nand best practices in the following areas will be prepared under each case study: \n(i)  key technological choices for applications targeting different settlement patterns, \nwaste composition, and treatment levels;  \n(ii)  mechanisms  for  constructing,  operating,  and  maintaining  rural  environmental \ninfrastructure,  including  institutional  arrangements  and  supporting  legal  and \npolicy frameworks;  \n(iii)  financing arrangements and supporting policy and legal frameworks, including \nfiscal transfers, subsidies, payment for ecosystem services, waste management \nfunds and bonds, and public\u2013private partnerships;  \n(iv)  policy and institutional arrangements for monitoring and enforcing rural water \nenvironment provisions, particularly with regard to drinking water sources; and  \n(v)  public  awareness  and  community  and  civil  society  participation  programs  to \npromote desirable behavioral changes.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Policy recommendations for improving rural sewage and household \nsolid-waste  management  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  prepared.  International \nexperience and best practices will be analyzed, focusing on appropriateness in the PRC context, \nand policy recommendations will be prepared on (i) technical solution options; (ii) financing and \noperation and management arrangements; and (iii) supporting regulatory and legal frameworks, \npublic  awareness,  community,  and  civil  society  participation  programs.  Public  awareness, \ncommunity, and civil society participation programs will be designed for implementation on a \npilot basis under the government\u2019s broader program to improve the rural environment. \n \n12.  Output 4: A knowledge product prepared. The knowledge product will summarize the \ncase studies and key policy recommendations.  \n \n13.  The  major  assumptions  considered  include  that  (i)  the  government  will  continue  to \nsupport rural environmental improvement, particularly sewage and solid-waste treatment; (ii) \nadequate local counterpart support is provided for the operation and maintenance of wastewater \nand solid-waste management systems; and (iii) international experiences and lessons on rural \nenvironmental protection can be applied to the PRC\u2019s institutional and socioeconomic context, \nafter  modifications.  The  risks  to  be  mitigated  are  the  difficulty  anticipated  in  cross-sector \ncoordination of government departments involved in rural environmental management, and in \nreaching consensus on an integrated management framework. \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $450,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $100,000 on a \ngrant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund6 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, and \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \nremuneration and per diems for counterpart staff (including time and travel expenses), logistical \nsupport  in  arrangement  of  workshops  and  conferences,  a  fully  functional  office  space  for \nconsultants with free water and utility supply and free access to the internet and a photocopying \nmachine, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The MEP will be the executing agency. A TA consultative committee will be established \nto  provide  guidance  on  project  implementation.  The  committee  will  be  led  by  the  MEP\u2019s \nDepartment of Ecology. This committee will comprise the deputy director general, a director and \na deputy director of the Department of Ecology, and a director of the Project Management \nDivision 1 of the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) of the MEP. FECO will be the \nimplementing agency, and a TA management office will be established in FECO to carry out \nday-to-day TA operations. The director of the Project Management Division 1 of FECO will \nserve as the executive director of the TA management office responsible for coordinating day-\nto-day operational matters among ADB, consultants, and related government agencies.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 16 months, from 1 December 2013 to 31 \nMarch 2015. A consulting firm will be engaged to assist ADB and the executing agency in \nimplementing the TA. The firm will provide a total of 26 person-months of consulting services, \nwhich will involve three international consultants (for a total of 10 person-months) and three \nnational consultants (for a total of 16 person-months). The consultants will be engaged following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The simplified \ntechnical proposal approach will be used to assess the qualifications of the bidding firms. The \ngovernment requested advance contracting to ensure that consultants will be mobilized on time. \nThe TA funds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  The TA results  will  be  disseminated through reports,  workshops,  and  a knowledge \nproduct. The knowledge product will be developed and disseminated in hard copies by ADB, the \nPRC Resident Mission, and the MEP, and will be posted on the ADB website.  \n \nIV.
