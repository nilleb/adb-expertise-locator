INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  2002  Country  Programming  Mission  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nconfirmed the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan request for technical assistance \n(TA) to prepare the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) Rural Development Project.1 \nThe ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan in July 2002 and held meetings with federal and \nlocal government departments and agencies, a cross-section of FATA elders and villagers \n(including women), and other stakeholders. Site visits were made to the project area during \nwhich an initial poverty and social assessment was conducted (Appendix 1). This report is \nbased on the understanding reached with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost \nestimates and financing plan, outline terms of reference, and implementation arrangements for \nthe TA.  \n \n2.  FATA is located in a narrow belt along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It consists of \nseven agencies and six bordering frontier regions,2 and is of immense strategic geographic and \npolitical importance. FATA acceded to Pakistan at Partition from India on the understanding that \nthey would remain autonomous, and are characterized by cultural conservatism and adherence \nto traditional values and practices. Although directly administered by the federal government, \nFATA's inhabitants maintain strong kinship alliances and economic linkages with neighboring \nAfghanistan.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In FATA\u2019s dry, sparse, hilly, and resource poor landscape, poverty is endemic and \npervasive. Indeed, FATA is the most impoverished region in Pakistan, lagging behind the rest of \nthe country in nearly all socioeconomic comparisons. The population numbers approximately \n3.14 million,3 or 2.4% of Pakistan\u2019s total population, and accounts for 3.4% of the country\u2019s land \narea. The population of FATA is totally rural in character. Government estimates show that as \nmuch as 60% of FATA households are below the poverty line.4 The region has a literacy rate of \n17.4% and a primary school participation rate of 41.3%, which are significantly lower than the \nnational averages of 45% and 77%, respectively. A mere 44% of the population has access to \nclean drinking water, as compared to 75% for the neighboring North-West Frontier Province \n(NWFP).  The  situation  of  women  is  even  more  difficult,  as  they  live  under  conservative \nsocioreligious conditions. Partly due to their exclusion from social interaction outside the village, \ndifficult roads access, and poorly staffed hospitals, women suffer from high rates of disease. \nAlmost all (97%) are illiterate, and have very limited opportunities for employment outside the \nhome. Currently, women are not formally or directly involved in the general community decision-\nmaking process, but are consulted at the household level. They are able to participate in home-\nbased economic activities; however, opportunities for off-farm work are currently extremely \nlimited and, generally, are culturally unacceptable. \n \n4.  Life is generally difficult in FATA. Only 7% of the land is under cultivation, of which about \nhalf is irrigated. Forest cover has declined over the years, most precipitously in recent times with \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 September 2001.  \n2  FATA  comprises  seven  agencies\u2013Bajaur,  Khyber,  Kurram,  Mohmand,  North    Waziristan,  Orakzai,  South \nWaziristan, and the Frontier Regions of Bannu, D. I. Khan, Kohat, Lakki, Peshawar, and Tank. \n3  According to the 1998 census. \n4  Data from various studies indicates that the incidence of poverty in the country increased from 26.6% in FY1993 to \n32.2% in FY1999, and the number of poor increased by over 12 million people during this period. In addition, \npoverty rose more sharply in the rural areas in the 1990s, and in FY1999 the incidence of rural poverty (36.3%) \nwas significantly higher than urban poverty (22.6%). ", "2  \nthe influx of Afghan refugees, which has accelerated erosion and flooding problems. Almost one \nthird of FATA is inaccessible to Government officials, so that development activities depend on \nlocal  decisions,  restricted  sometimes  by  a  lack  of  interclan  cooperation.  Employment \nopportunities are limited; the young and better educated choose between underemployment at \nhome or migration to the country\u2019s urban centers or the Gulf States; as a result the people of \nFATA also depend on remittances from migrants. \n \n5.  Agriculture, animal husbandry, and the sustainable use of natural resources are the \nfoundation of FATA\u2019s economy. Agriculture productivity however is below subsistence level. \nLandholdings are small and fragmented and the cropping pattern is dominated by subsistence \ncereal cultivation. Vegetables and fruits are the main cash crops, but growers are limited in their \nability to profit from the apparent advantage in some areas for producing off-season vegetables \nand high-value fruits by limited transportation and market access. Livestock is also of vital \neconomic importance in FATA, and a likely source of increased income, especially for women. \nNatural resource depletion is a major problem, as evidenced through soil erosion, watershed \ndeforestation,  and  uncontrolled  grazing  on  drought-stressed rangelands. Deforestation and \ndegradation of grazing lands has resulted in the loss of income-earning opportunities, severely \nreduced fuelwood availability, and increased flooding in the lowlands.  \n \n6.  Water for sustenance and irrigation is a major need, and was flagged as the first priority \nby the communities consulted. Most families have little to no access to a steady supply of water \nfor agriculture, and pressure on the irrigated land is the most intense with 32 persons per \nirrigated hectare compared to 7 for the country overall. Many farmers have access to less than \n0.40 hectares of irrigated land on which they can barely grow enough grain to feed themselves. \nPartly due to deforestation, irrigation water is unreliable. Water use is inefficient and marred by \nonfarm water practices that are wasteful. The main source of irrigation in FATA is springs and \nunderground water. In some valleys, vegetable and fruit orchards have access to water from \nnatural  streams,  springs,  lift  pumps,  dug-wells,  and  shallow  and  deep  turbine  tube  wells. \nHowever, information on underground water availability and its potential is poor.  \n \n7.  Transportation infrastructure development in FATA is rudimentary. Main roads lead up to \nand through FATA; however, many communities do not have links to the main roads and \ntherefore  little  access  to  hospitals,  schools,  and  markets.  Fully  one  third  of  the  area  is \ninaccessible because of poor communication links and refusal of some groups to allow access \nto outsiders. Feeder and link roads to most valleys, especially the inaccessible areas, require \nsignificant upgrading. Inaccessible areas cannot join the mainstream of rural Pakistan without \nbetter communication routes, which would improve the outreach capacity of production and \nsocial service line departments as well as accessibility to social infrastructure for beneficiaries. \n \n8.  The system of governance of FATA is changing as part of federal government policy, \nwhich  will  inevitably  affect  their  historical  autonomy.  The  civil  administration  was  formerly \nmanaged both by the FATA cells within the NWFP government and the FATA Development \nCorporation. These line departments and agencies were recently consolidated into a governor\u2019s \nsecretariat for FATA under the office of the governor of NWFP, consolidating administration of \ndevelopment activities and increasing funding for FATA programs. However, technical and \nmanagement skills within FATA are low. Service delivery institutions are present in FATA, but \ncoverage is insufficient, communications a major challenge, and program resources limited. \nTheir ability to plan and implement a large-scale program is a constraint: actual expenditures on \ndevelopment projects are often less than available funds due to slow release of resources from \nFederal programs, a lack of coordination and forward planning, deficiencies in monitoring, \nunclear  responsibilities,  and  regular  transfers  of  government  personnel.  In  addition, \n ", "  3\nprofessionals and technicians from government or the private sector are reluctant to work in \nFATA, requiring special incentives and rewards to attract them. Local, elected government will \nbe introduced within the next year to increase local accountability and create a broad-based, \nparticipatory, and transparent process of project selection and service delivery.  \n \n9.  FATA has experienced a \u201cpoverty of development\u201d as evidenced by a declining rate of \ngrowth of real per capita public expenditure since the mid-1990s.5 The region has also received \nscant attention from the external aid community.6 In an effort to ameliorate the current situation, \nthe Government recently approved a strategy to bring FATA  at par with other areas of the \ncountry through support for broad-based rural development by (i) developing and/or improving \nthe region\u2019s socioeconomic infrastructure, including the road network, irrigation channels, and \ndrinking  water  supply;  (ii)  enhancing  employment  generating  opportunities  through  human \nresource development and access to financial services, with emphasis on community-based \nincome generating projects, with supporting training and skills development to ensure financial \nindependence and self-reliance; (iii) effectively managing FATA\u2019s natural resources, including \nforests; (iv) facilitating community awareness and mobilization; and (v) decreasing/removing \nentrenched gender disparities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will prepare a design for a project to support the Government\u2019s efforts (para. 9) \nto (i) reduce the incidence of poverty in FATA through sustainable and appropriate development \nactivities,  (ii)  improve  livelihoods  among  the  rural  population  by  increasing  incomes  and \nemployment  opportunities  through  a  mix  of  economic  and  social  interventions,  (iii)  arrest \nresource and environmental degradation, and (iv) facilitate the mainstreaming of FATA into the \ncountry\u2019s economic and political system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA has four design aims: (i) provide communication and productive infrastructure \n(drinking water, irrigation, and access roads.); (ii) increase incremental household incomes \nthrough improved agriculture and natural resource-based productivity; (iii) enhance nonfarm \nemployment  opportunities  through  effective  delivery  of  financial  services  and  training  for \ntechnical skills development; and (iv) strengthen community-based organizations (CBOs) and \nservice delivery agencies.  \n \n12.  Accordingly, the TA will (i) assess and propose approaches to strengthen agricultural \n(including livestock) extension and other support services that are more responsive to farmer\u2019s \nneeds, and evaluate requisite marketing opportunities; (ii) propose  interventions related to \nharvesting of water and community-based small irrigation structures to improve the conservation \nof water and facilitate and ensure its availability for irrigation and drinking water supplies; (iii) \n                                                 \n5   Based on a Planning Commission research study entitled \u201cEvaluation of Investment in FATA,\u201d June 2002.  \n6  External aid financed projects include (i) A $17.0 million International Fund for Agricultural Development loan, \nSouth FATA Area Development Project, approved in January 2000 and which became effective June 2002; and (ii) \nongoing support from the Narcotics Affairs Section of the United States Embassy for area development projects in \nthree FATA agencies (Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand) totaling approximately $20 million. The projects in Bajaur \nand Mohmand are planned for completion in December 2003, and the Khyber project will be completed in June \n2006. \n \n ", "4  \nassess the potential and propose interventions for effective natural resource management, \nincluding improved community watershed management and soil conservation approaches; (iv) \nassess the scope of expansion of farm and nonfarm productivity through rural credit, and the \nmost appropriate way of introducing and administering rural financial services; and (v) assess \nimprovements to the road communication network to open the inaccessible areas and support \nfarm and nonfarm development. \n \n13.  Interventions to support decentralized and accountable service delivery will also be \nassessed. Ways of providing vocational training and skills development using or expanding on \navailable institutions and capabilities will be investigated, as will the potential for improved \nservice delivery linked to expanding capabilities of community leaders in project design and \nimplementation  based  on  training  targeted  to  community  leaders  and  organizations.  The \npotential for involving rural support programs and other nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nparticularly in strengthening CBOs, will be considered, with recommendations on how best to \nuse their capabilities. Ways to upgrade management skills of administrators and elected leaders \nto support the overall approach of the Project will be defined, along with ways in which the new \nrelationships between communities and administrators can be most fruitful. \n \n14.  The TA will define mechanisms and criteria for (i) identifying and targeting the causes of \npoverty, and (ii) selecting project communities or village clusters and subprojects. It will use and \nincorporate lessons learned from applicable completed and ongoing rural development, poverty \nalleviation,  and  natural  resources  management  projects  in  the  country.  In  preparing  the \nproposed project, a systems approach will be followed to ensure a thorough understanding of \nthe interactions among various systems and subsystems involved. The TA and ensuing loan-\nfinanced project will use participatory planning, implementation, and monitoring involving the \nclient population and stakeholders, primarily following the systems learning approach.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $938,000 equivalent, consisting of $461,000 in \nforeign exchange and $477,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will cover the entire \nforeign exchange costs and $289,000 equivalent of the local currency costs for a total of \n$750,000  equivalent.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of \n$188,000 equivalent. Detailed cost estimates are found in Appendix 2. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not constitute a commitment by \nADB to finance an ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Governor\u2019s Secretariat for FATA will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and will be \nresponsible for coordination with other provincial and federal Government departments and \nagencies to ensure provision of requisite support to the TA consultants, including access to \ninformation and project sites and facilities. Specific assurances from the government include (i) \nthe  appointment  of  a  qualified  and  experienced  project  coordinator  fluent  in  English,  and \nrequisite full-time counterpart and support staff to provide overall support and coordination; (ii) \nassistance with the provision of appropriate transportation for the consultants and government \ncounterparts; (iii) office space, utilities, furnishings, and local communication facilities for the \nconsultants and counterparts; and (iv) assistance with surveys, stakeholder workshops, and \nparticipatory exercises. \n \n ", "  5\n17.  A total of 58 person-months of consulting services, comprising 18 person-months of \ninternational and 40 person-months of domestic inputs. A consulting firm or consortium of firms \nwill be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the \nquality  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure will be used for \nselecting the consulting firm. International consultant expertise will be required in institutional \nand  rural  development,  human  resource  development,  rural  infrastructure,  watershed \nmanagement, and economics (to prepare the economic and financial analysis of the Project). \nDomestic consultant expertise is required in agricultural economics and agricultural marketing, \nagricultural development, rural finance and enterprise development, animal husbandry and \nlivestock development, rural infrastructure, irrigation systems, community forestry and range \nmanagement, rural sociology and community development, gender and development, training \nand development, institutions and governance, and environmental impact assessment and \nmitigation. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, commencing in January 2003 and ending in \nJuly 2003. The TA consultants will be based in Peshawar, and will travel and work extensively in \nthe project area. The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 3 weeks of the start of \nthe study outlining the work plan for implementation of the TA, clear and detailed selection \ncriteria for the project area, and preliminary findings relevant to the design of the project; (ii) an \ninterim report within 12 weeks after commencing their services focusing on the initial results of \nthe social analysis and the rural planning initiatives, and proposing options for a project; (iii) a \ndraft final report and feasibility study for the government within 5 months of the study period; \nand (iv) a final report within 1 month after comments on the draft final report have been provided \nby the Government and ADB. Initial activities to be undertaken, using participatory approaches, \nwill  include  a  detailed  social  assessment,  including  socioeconomic  and  gender  analyses, \nanalysis of constraints and opportunities for development, assessment of local expertise and \ncapacity  to  implement  project  activities,  and  indicative  needs  assessment  of  the  target \npopulation and local institutions relevant to rural development initiatives. A series of stakeholder \nworkshops  will  be  convened  in  Peshawar  and  the  project  area  at  key  stages  of  TA \nimplementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Pakistan  for  preparing  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas  Rural \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \nA.

Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: PI \nProject area selection and stakeholder identification are required using participatory rapid appraisal techniques, \nlinked with the introduction of participatory planning strategies.  Detailed poverty and social analyses will be \nundertaken, identifying constraints and barriers affecting women, the poor, and other vulnerable groups.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \n Poverty and social analysis teams will conduct initial field consultations using various participatory appraisal \ntechniques  to  conduct  sample  baseline  surveys,  gender  analysis,  identify  stakeholders,  and  initiate  social \nmobilization. A systems learning approach will be used involving stakeholders and their representatives in a \ncontinuing participatory planning process.  Focus groups and project area-based workshops will be conducted to \ncontribute to, and validate the project design as representative of stakeholder consensus and to ensure ownership. \n \nParticipation strategy required: No \n \nD.
