At a donors\u2019 meeting held in Sydney in June 2002, major funding agencies to the Pacific \ncountries  discussed  their  approaches  to  identifying  and  addressing  poverty.  The  agencies \nagreed to an Asian Development Bank (ADB) suggestion that a coordinated regional approach \nto poverty analysis would be more cost effective and efficient than each agency working in \nisolation. Participants agreed that ADB would take the lead in coordinating efforts to design a \nPacific fund for strategic poverty analysis. ADB subsequently secured funding from the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund to examine the feasibility and potential scope of the proposed \nmulti-agency activity.1 \n \n2.  The  study  consulted  extensively  with  stakeholders  in  the  Pacific  Island  countries, \ndevelopment partners, and regional institutions to (i) assess the feasibility of a poverty fund; (ii) \nagree on essential procedures, location, and management structure; and (iii) suggest types of \nactivities the fund might undertake. A draft report was presented at the regional Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) workshop in Nadi, Fiji Islands, in March 2003, and subsequently \ndistributed  for  further  comment  to  governments,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs), \ndevelopment  partners,  and  regional  organizations.  While  the  feasibility  study  referred  to  a \n\"fund,\" discussions with stakeholders acknowledged that a fund is not the only mechanism for \nimproving donor coordination, and that a coordinated program (the Program) may allow more \nflexibility. At a follow-up to a regional donors' meeting in Sydney in July 2003, ADB, Australian \nAgency for International Development, New Zealand Agency for International Development, and \nthe World Bank reached substantial agreement on the concept for the Program, and agreed that \nADB would prepare a concept paper reflecting the agreement, for further consideration and \ndiscussion.  The  concept  paper  was  presented  and  discussed  at  the  Thirteenth  Regional \nMeeting of Heads of Statistics in Noumea, New Caledonia, on 15\u201319 September 2003, and \nreceived widespread support. ADB agreed to initiate the Program through technical assistance \n(TA) while continuing its involvement in consultations with other agencies regarding their future \ncontributions to the Program. Funding for the TA from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund \nand  the  Cooperation  Fund  in  Support  of  the  Formulation  and  Implementation  of  National \nPoverty Reduction Strategies was endorsed at the 2nd Strategy Meeting in December 2002. The \nTA\u2019s goals, purpose, and scope are summarized in the TA framework (Appendix 1).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Until recently, poverty in the Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) did not \ncommand as much attention as in most other developing countries partly because most Pacific \nsocieties consider that traditional support mechanisms provide for the vulnerable, and partly \nbecause of political sensitivities to the issue.3 There is growing evidence of rising poverty and \nhardship levels in many PDMCs due to two decades of weak economic performance, and \nassociated  with  rapid  population  growth,  urban  drift,  and  weakening  traditional  support \nmechanisms.4  With  the  countries'  commitments  to  achieve  the  MDGs,  governments  are \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Pacific Fund for Strategic Poverty Analysis. Manila. (TA 6061 for $50,000.) \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 8 January 2003.  \n3 Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Republic of Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New  \nGuinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu. \n4 Work carried out under TA 6002 (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Consultation Workshops for Poverty \nReduction Strategies in Pacific Developing Member Countries. Manila.) and TA 6047 (ADB. 2002. Technical \nAssistance for the Preparation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies in Pacific Developing Member Countries. \nManila.) show that in countries where the incidence of poverty has been measured, relatively large proportions of \nthe national population live under the basic needs poverty lines. For instance, in Kiribati, 51% of the population of ", "2 \nincreasingly aware of the importance of addressing poverty or hardship reduction. To do so, \ncountries will need to (i) collect, analyze, and disseminate the data required to assess poverty; \n(ii) develop the human and institutional capacities to use the data to develop poverty reduction \npolicies in a participatory manner; and (iii) monitor progress toward achievement of the MDGs.  \n \n4.  The six participatory studies of the priorities of the poor, or people in hardship, that ADB \nhas completed so far all point, very clearly and consistently, to two priority areas that define \npoverty or hardship in the region: (i) the need to improve access to, and delivery of, essential \nsocial  services,  primary  education,  and  primary  healthcare;  and  (ii)  improved  access  to \ncommercial markets to sell produce and services and to secure formal jobs.5 Existing statistical \ndata  bases  and  regional  efforts  such  as  the  General  Data  Dissemination  System  do  not \nadequately focus on analyzing and monitoring these priorities. \n \n5.  While the capacity of the individual PDMCs in data collection and analysis varies, most \ngovernments and NGO representatives acknowledged that capacity needs to be enhanced \ndespite many years of such effort. Most PDMCs have conducted either a census or a household \nsurvey within the last 5 years (Appendix 2). The analyses of surveys and poverty assessments \nhave mostly been carried out under externally financed initiatives and by external consultants, \nwith limited skill transfer and minimal confidence building in poverty analysis. As a result, the \nPDMCs\u2019 capacities to analyze social data for poverty measurements and the demand for and \nownership of such assessments have not been strengthened. Often, the problem is not so much \na lack of data but one of quality and consistency of data and a lack of capacity to use it. Many \ncountries have substantial administrative data, currently underused for poverty assessments, \npartly due to the lack of appropriate communication and coordination links between national \nstatistical offices, statistics offices in line ministries, and national planning departments. Data \nfrom  many  surveys  cannot  be  compared  with  that  from  other  key  sources,  due  to \ninconsistencies  between  survey  design  and  indicators  used,  incomplete  complementarity \nbetween  questions,  and  the  use  of  unrepresentative  samples.  Data  dissemination  and \nmaintenance pose an additional problem. Of further concern is the lack of prioritization of \nnational development strategies in most PDMCs on issues of concern to the poor, and the lack \nof implementation of programs and policies. \n \n6.  Most stakeholders consulted during the feasibility study stressed the commitment of the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) to the region's development, and its extensive \nexperience in capacity building in social and economic statistics in the PDMCs, and suggested \nthat SPC be the executing agency for the Pacific Poverty Program. The Social Resources \nDivision of SPC combines the statistics, demography and population, public health, women, \nyouth, reproductive health, and community education programs. The division is therefore in an \nexcellent position to ensure that the TA benefits from this multi-disciplinary expertise. SPC is \nalso currently carrying out complementary projects such as the Pacific regional information  \nsystem (PRISM) project, and a population geographic information system project. ADB has \nworked successfully on several projects with SPC.6  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nSouth Tarawa; in the Federated States of Micronesia, and Papua New Guinea 39.5% and 37.5%, respectively, are \nestimated to live below the basic needs poverty line. \n5 Participatory poverty assessments have been completed in Fiji Islands, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, \nSamoa,  Tonga,  Tuvalu,  and  Vanuatu,  under  TAs  6002  (ADB.  2002,  Technical  Assistance  for  Consultation \nWorkshops for Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Pacific Developing Member Countries. Manila.) and 6047 (see \nfootnote 4). \n6 SPC is, for instance, the Executing Agency for TA 5896 (ADB. 2002. Strengthening the Live Reef Fish Trade \nManagement in the Pacific Developing Member Countries. Manila). ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The goal of the TA is to assist PDMCs to develop the capacity to formulate pro-poor \nstrategies and budgets in a participatory manner, thereby enabling them to reduce poverty and \nachieve progress toward the MDGs. The short- and medium-term objectives of the TA are to \nenhance the capacity and demand, within government  and civil society, for the collection, \nanalysis, and effective use of consistent and high quality data related to poverty and hardship.  \n \n8.   The TA will facilitate consultation with stakeholders and initiate the establishment of the \nProgram as the main information-sharing and coordination mechanism for regional poverty data \ncollection, analysis, and monitoring activities. The TA will encourage the contribution of other \ndevelopment partners to the Program in order to build on, expand, and extend the TA activities. \n \n9.  The scope of activities of the TA will initially focus on the short- and medium-term \nobjectives  with  a  view  to  expanding  the  scope  of  activities  depending  on  demand  and \ncontributions of other agencies to the Program. The TA framework contains a detailed list of \noutputs. Outputs will be further defined after the needs of the individual PDMCs have been \nassessed. \n \n10.  The quality of surveys and analyses that relate to poverty will be strengthened by (i) \nensuring  that  each  PDMC  has  at  least  one  reasonably  recent  good  quality  census  and \nhousehold survey; (ii) providing funds for adding components that focus on poverty or hardship \nto  routine  surveys;  (iii)  assisting  in  the  questionnaire  design,  ensuring  consistency,  and \nharmonizing definitions, particularly those related to MDGs; (iv) providing quality assurance for \nsurvey design and implementation, including implications for sample design of the need for \nappropriate subnational estimates; and (v) ensuring that adequate attention is given to sex-\ndisaggregated data, and, where appropriate, ethnicity-disaggregated data. \n \n11.  Capacity  will  be  strengthened  and  built  for  participatory  poverty  assessments.  The \nassessments will focus on community perception and priorities to provide government and \ndevelopment partners with directions for policy and program development. Capacity will also be \nstrengthened for (i) better use of available data, particularly administrative data, for poverty \nanalyses;  and  (ii)  using  the  data  to  develop  strategies  for  equitable  growth  and  hardship \nalleviation, and linking these to national development strategies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA builds on work of earlier regional TA, and work conducted by other agencies \nrelated to poverty data collection and analysis. It will benefit from the synergies with current \nactivities in the region. The TA will commence with the development of a paper providing \ndirection for governments and societies of PDMCs on how to address prioritization of national \ndevelopment and poverty reduction strategies, particularly with respect to the priorities of the \npoor, and their need for improved access to basic social services and employment creation.This \nwork will be based on quantitative and qualitative poverty assessments conducted by ADB \nunder several technical assistance projects.7 \n                                                 \n7 TA 5906 (ADB. 2002. Poverty Assessment in Pacific Developing Member Countries. Manila); TA 6002 (ADB. 2001. \nConsultation Workshop for Poverty covering Kiribati, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu, TA 6047 \ncovering Republic of Fiji Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Tonga, and Tuvalu; TA 3667 (ADB. 2001. \nTechnical  Assistance  for  Poverty  Analysis  for  Socioeconomic  Development  Strategies  [Papua  New  Guinea]. ", "4 \n \n13.  TA  activities  will  emphasize  (i)  strengthening  the  demand  for  poverty  statistics  to \nenhance ownership and sustainability by fostering greater participation of civil society in data \ncollection, poverty analysis, monitoring, and evaluation; (ii) focusing all activities funded by the \nTA, such as support for surveys, participatory poverty assessments, and poverty analysis, as \nwell  as  the  development  of  policy  responses,  on  capacity  building  and  institutional \nstrengthening;  (iii)  where  available,  providing  technical  support  using  local  and  regional \nconsultants; and (iv)  building a regional database of local consultants. \n \n14.   The scope of the TA activities is expected to expand once the Program is established \nand more development partners provide contributions. Some of the key activities that the TA will \nsupport are the assessment of (i) poverty data collection and analysis related activities in the \nPDMCs (on a country and regional level); the assessment will be updated regularly, reported on \na six-monthly basis to all relevant agencies, and disseminated via the PRISM network; (ii) \navailable data, and data analysis and capacity needs (related to poverty and the priorities \nexpressed by the poor), in order to develop work programs for each PDMC; and (iii) the \ncoordination of data users (e.g., national planning offices) and data producers (e.g., national \nstatistical offices and line ministries) and suggestions to improve the coordination. \n \n15.  The assessments will identify the priorities for the TA activities. The TA will focus on (i) \ncountries that have not been covered by previous poverty assessments under TA 6002 and \n6047 (footnote 7), and (ii) PDMCs that show strong commitment and ownership. This will \ninclude participatory poverty assessments with capacity building for Cook Islands, Kiribati, and \nSolomon Islands; improvement of the quality and poverty focus of household surveys for Cook \nIslands, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, and Tuvalu; and general data quality improvement as a \nregional activity. Funding for activities that were identified as priorities in the assessments but \ncannot be covered by the TA will be sought from other development partners. \n \n16.  Other key activities include: (i) defining poverty and hardship related data in consultation \nwith stakeholders; the information collected during the participatory poverty assessments will \nhelp to guide what type of data should be collected; (ii) supporting, in coordination with United \nNations  Development  Programme  and  other  relevant  agencies,  the  monitoring  of  MDGs \nincluding the discussion of the relevance and determination of indicators and targets appropriate \nfor PDMCs; and (iii) reviewing, with the participation of civil society organizations and PDMC \ngovernments, lessons learned during implementation of TA, and preparing a revised Program \ndocument based on lessons learned and disseminating it to all stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.15 million equivalent, with an amount not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $800,000  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund and the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and \nImplementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies, each for $400,000 equivalent. ADB \nwill provide $200,000 on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. The Executing Agency \nwill provide the balance of $150,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions. The governments \nof PDMCs will provide counterpart support for in-country activities. Detailed cost estimates and \nthe financing plan are provided in Appendix 3.  \n                                                                                                                                                          \nManila.),  TA  3623  (ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  for  Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  for \nSocioeconomic Equity Assessment [Samoa]. Manila.) and TA 3432 (ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Poverty \nAssessment [Tonga]. Manila.). ", "  5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Executing Agency of the TA is the Social Resources Division of SPC in Noumea, \nNew Caledonia. Two international consultants (a poverty specialist and development economist \nand a social analyst and participatory poverty assessment specialist) will be selected by SPC \nafter appropriate consultation with ADB, including preparing terms of reference and evaluation \ncriteria. They will be recruited on an individual basis in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nSelection of Consultants for a total period of 23 person-months. The two consultants will be \nbased at SPC. Other international or domestic consultants will be selected and recruited by \nSPC as needed in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Selection of Consultants, and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants,  and  after \nappropriate consultation with ADB. \n \n19.   One international consultant (development economist) will be recruited by ADB for 2 \nperson-months to produce a poverty priorities strategy paper, and one domestic consultant will \nbe based at ADB for the duration of the TA. The two consultants will be recruited by ADB as \nindividuals  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Selection  of  Consultants,  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. All consultants \nwill be nationals of ADB member countries, and ADB funding will be confined to benefiting \nPDMCs. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. The TA will be \nexecuted over a period of 24 months, and is expected to commence in February 2004 and be \ncompleted by March 2006. \n \n20.  SPC will prepare half-yearly reports on its activities for submission to ADB, and will \nconsult on arrangements for workshops, seminars, and training, and the hiring of short-term and \nlocal consultants. SPC will also prepare a half-yearly update on poverty data collection, and \nanalysis activities in the region. The update will be disseminated on the PRISM web site, and \ndistributed to all relevant agencies, PDMCs, and NGOs. The team leader will provide a final \nreport with recommendations and lessons learned during TA implementation. ADB will monitor \nthe TA progress through review missions and through consultations with other development \npartners. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and the Cooperation \nFund  in  Support  of  the  Formulation  and  Implementation  of  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategies, each for $400,000 equivalent; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis for Strengthening Poverty Analysis and Strategies in \nthe Pacific, and hereby
