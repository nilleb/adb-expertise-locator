To prepare phase 2 of the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program (ISSP 2), a \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) is required. Through this TA, Asian Development \nBank (ADB) will flexibly provide strategic policy advice to the government in preparing the \nprogram and meeting the conditions to process the loan. As the policy conditions for the loan \nmust  be  in  place  at  time  of  approval,  this  PPTA  serves  to  provide  the  needed  technical \nassistance for the government to meet the conditions at the time of loan approval.  A policy and \nadvisory  TA  will  be  processed  in  2016  in  conjunction  with  the  program  loan  to  help  the \ngovernment meet the conditions for receipt of the second tranche of the program loan. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  Assessing  the  impact  of  phase  1  of  the  Infrastructure  Sustainability  Support \nProgram (ISSP), and devising a program which entrenches the gains made to date and \nwhere further reform is required. ISSP 1 supported the government in its efforts to improve \nroad  and  water  service  provision  through  results-based  public  management  and  financing \nreforms. ISSP 1 supported the government in implementing a number of reforms in the road \ntransport and water sectors, including: piloting program budgeting initiatives, preparing financing \nstrategies,  improving  internal  audit  practices,  aligning  disparate  agencies  in  the  sectors, \nimproving asset management and improving financing prioritization processes. These changes \nhave made tangible impacts in terms of policies and practices. However, to embed the changes \nwithin the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MOTC) and the State Committee for Water \nEconomy (SCWE), further support is required to build capacity of staff in these agencies and \nensure weaknesses in internal controls and practices do not interfere with day-to-day operations. \nIn addition, a method to entrench these gains is to continue the reform process along the path of \nthe successes to date. Fiduciary assessment will be reviewed, and additional activities will be \nassessed to determine the next steps in public financial management reforms in these two \nsectors and choosing the best approaches to implement them.  \n \n3.  Developing a program and policy actions for ISSP 2 based on international best \npractice. To continue the reform efforts in the road transport and water sectors, the ADB team \nand TA consultants will examine the current situation in the roads and water sectors in Armenia \nand determine what are the key constraints to ensure technical and financial sustainability in \nthese sectors. Based on this analysis and a review of international best-practice in water and \nroad transport, a draft policy matrix will be developed with policy actions which will put Armenia \non a path to improved water delivery and road transport services. Once the draft policy matrix is \ndeveloped, the ADB team and TA consultants will undertake some preliminary discussions with \ngovernment on the design of the program.  \n \n4.  Supporting  the  government  in  implementing  the  ISSP  2  policy  actions.  The \ngovernment will be responsible for meeting the policy actions, however, some of the policy \nactions  will  require  technical  skills  and  expertise  which  may  not  be  readily  and  presently \navailable within the relevant government agencies at this time. Further, international experience \nand alternative perspectives can help the government agencies to find optimal solutions and \novercome any issues which may inhibit progress. Finally, implementing the policy conditions \nbuilds capacity within these government agencies and support can help entrench the reforms. \n \n5.  The major activities are summarized in Table A3.1.  \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Activities \n  Expected  \nActivities  Completion Date \nAssess the impact of ISSP 1, the current situation in the road transport and water  Jan 2015 \nsupply sectors in Armenia to get an understanding of the technical and financial \nconstraints to sustainable service delivery in these sectors.  \nReview international best practice in road transport maintenance and water delivery to  Jan 2015 \nunderstand the gap between that and the Armenian context. \nBased on above analysis, develop a draft policy matrix as a basis for initial discussions  Jan 2015 \u2013 Jan 2016 \nwith the government. \nFinalize the policy matrix with ADB and the government.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n6.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others).
