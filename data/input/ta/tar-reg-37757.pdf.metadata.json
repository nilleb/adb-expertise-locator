Siddiq, Mekong Department. ", "   \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  Over one third of the population in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries live \nbelow the poverty line. The majority of the poor are women. Despite rapid economic growth in \ncountries like the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand, 20% of the rural population \nlive in poverty.1 In other GMS countries such as Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR), Myanmar, and Viet Nam, poverty rates are 50% or higher. Nearly 23 million people \n(70% of the poor people) in the GMS are smallholder farmers who depend on livestock for food \nsecurity. Livestock are an important and often the only source of cash income for poor farmers. \nThey  are  an  asset  for  investment  and  insurance  against  crop  failure.  They  support  crop \nproduction through draft power and produce manure to maintain soil fertility. Livestock are a \nparticularly important source of income for women who account for over 50% of agriculture \nproduction. Introducing policy and technological options that make livestock-dependent poor \nfarmers,  especially  women,  less  vulnerable  to  devastating  effects  of  animal  diseases  and \nsupport their access to markets for economic growth is a major priority in GMS.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Livestock represent only 15% of the agricultural gross domestic product in Southeast \nAsia, but are a strategic part of the small-farm economy in the region. The demand for livestock \nproducts in the region is projected to increase by 3.5% to 4.0% annually to the year 2020.2 This \nincrease\u2014predominantly driven by high-income growth, rapid urbanization, and changes in \ndietary  patterns\u2014will  present  tremendous  opportunities  for  reducing  poverty  among  poor \nsmallholders by way of improving incomes through commercialization of livestock products. \nHowever, to fully participate and exploit these market opportunities, poor smallholders in GMS \ncountries will have to produce healthy and productive animals. Unfortunately, they are currently \nconstrained by transboundary animal diseases (TAD), such as classical swine fever (CSF), foot-\nand-mouth disease (FMD), and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). These diseases kill \nanimals and reduce productivity, threaten livelihoods of poor smallholders, drain public sector \nresources, hinder efforts to reduce poverty, and restrict regional and international trade. The \nmorbidity and mortality rates of livestock due to these diseases are often as high as 50\u201370% in \nmany parts of the GMS.3  \n \n3.  The poor in the developing world face particularly high risk from animal diseases. First, \nmore diseases are present because the majority of the poor live in climates and ecosystems \nthat favor a wide range of infections. Second, the widespread unrestricted movement of animals \nfor marketing, social and other reasons enhances the spread of certain diseases. Third, the \ncurrent livestock production systems of the poor further enhance the risk of animal and human \ndiseases through confounding factors such as poor housing, multiple species, and poor nutrition \nand animal hygiene. Recent epidemics of CSF and FMD in Europe and, more recently, the \nspread of HPAI and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Asia have demonstrated \nthe enormous damage to livestock industry and loss of human lives from TAD. Participatory \npoverty assessment surveys have shown that 70% of producers rank animal diseases as a \nmajor constraint to their household incomes.4 Controlling such diseases is a strong incentive for \nregional cooperation and underscores the need for this project.5 \n                                                 \n1  Poverty is defined as per capita earnings of less than $1 a day. \n2  Delgado, C. et al. 1999.

Manila. \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 4 December 2003. ", "2       \n4.  Cross-border trade in livestock among GMS countries\u2014predominantly from Cambodia, \nsouthern PRC, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam into Thailand\u2014is significant and rising. \nRecent estimates from Yunnan show that total annual trade in livestock and livestock products \nwith Myanmar amounted to $365 million; Viet Nam, $136 million; Thailand, $32 million; Lao \nPDR, $20 million; and Cambodia, $1 million. Trade between Lao PDR and Thailand is estimated \nto be over $25 million (footnote 3). Informal trade is one of the primary reasons for the spread of \nTAD, limiting formal opportunities for interregional trade in livestock and livestock products. \n \n5.  Given the nature of this problem in GMS, there is a need to take a two-phase approach \nto contain TAD. In phase 1, it is necessary to (i) develop and operationalize a cooperation \nframework that entails common regional policies and regulations governing animal movement, \ninformation sharing, standardized protocols for diagnostic techniques and vaccines; and (ii) \nupgrade regional and national diagnostic laboratories and strengthen staff capacity. In phase 2, \nvaccination programs\u2014in collaboration with the private sector\u2014in preselected target disease \ncontrol zones can be implemented to demonstrate that significantly reducing animal morbidity \nand mortality rates can have a tangible impact on incomes of poor livestock holders. Activities of \nphase 1 are crucial and cannot be implemented without effective regional cooperation. \n \n6.  The GMS Economic Cooperation Project (GMS-ECP) recently initiated investments in \nagriculture by creating a Working Group on Agriculture, which met for the first time in January \n2003 in Manila, Philippines. During this meeting, the group reviewed several concepts prepared \nthrough extensive regional consultation, and approved some for further development. One of \nthese  concepts  was  livestock  disease  control  with  a  focus  on  regional  approaches  and \ntransboundary issues. This project is consistent with the goals set out by GMS-ECP that aim to \n(i)  increase  regional  cooperation  among  its  members,  (ii)  boost  trade,  and  (iii)  initiate \ninterventions  that  reduce  poverty  through  mutual  learning  and  sharing of information and \ntechnology. This project will also provide complementarity to the ongoing livestock projects in \nthe region supported by various aid sources such as European Union, Food and Agriculture \nOrganization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO),  Japan  International Cooperation Agency (JICA), \nOffice International des \u00c9pizooties (OIE), V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires sans Fronti\u00e8res (VSF), and World Bank. \nStandardized  training  and  capacity  building,  information  sharing,  and  public-private  sector \npartnership are unique features of this project that are hitherto missing in country-specific \nprojects. The activities of this project are consistent with ADB\u2019s country-specific operations.6  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  This project will implement activities of the proposed phase 1 (para. 5).  The main \ninnovative feature of this proposal is the development of regional cooperation and collaboration \namong five GMS countries (Cambodia, PRC, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam) to address \ncommon issues related to control of TAD that are predominantly spread by animal movement \nacross these countries. Without regional cooperation, these diseases cannot be controlled. The \nproject will build on existing activities in the region and aim to integrate them to focus on the \nthree most important trade-limiting diseases: CSF, FMD, and HPAI. Regional cooperation will \nfoster strong partnership among all stakeholders and beneficiaries including livestock farmers \nand  traders,  veterinarians,  extension  workers,  community  health  service  providers, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), veterinary departments, border control units, and private \npharmaceutical companies. \n                                                 \n6  For instance, a livestock development project for the Lao PDR is in the pipeline for 2004, and the loan itself for \n2006. This project will also be complementary to a number of ongoing rural and agricultural development projects, \nfunded by ADB and other partners in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam that have livestock components. ", "3 \n8.  The project also aims, for the first time, to engage PRC as a key player and partner in \nthe regional consortium for TAD control. Substantial live animal movements across southern \nPRC,  Thailand,  Lao  PDR  and  Myanmar  result  in  the  spread  of  TAD.7  Without  PRC's \nparticipation,  these  diseases  cannot  be  effectively  controlled.  Following  the  devastating \noutbreaks of SARS in 2003 and HPAI in 2004, PRC recently committed to address the problem \nthrough regional collaboration.8 PRC's participation will also be important as it will be a key \nplayer in supporting training for many of the other poor countries in the region and also funding \nmost of its disease control projects.  \n \n9.  The innovative feature of the project will be the major shift in the approach to TAD \ncontrol. The traditional approach of controlling diseases by applying mass, blanket vaccination \nto control outbreaks has been unsustainable and expensive, as shown by such practices in \nmany parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. In this project, the source and the flow of CSF, FMD, \nand HPAI infections will be targeted. Since it is well known that the source of infections for the \nthree  diseases  is  among  poor  smallholders,  accurate  mapping  of  diseases  among  these \ncommunities  through  sound  epidemiological  information  and  economic  impact  studies  will \nensure targeting of resources to benefit resource-poor farmers. This major shift in paradigm of \ndisease control in the long run will be cheaper and more sustainable, and also provide a more \nrational basis for the OIE zoning approach.9 \n \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n10.  The long-term goal is to control TAD in GMS to enhance food security, safety, and \naugment local, regional, international trade in livestock and livestock products. The immediate \npurpose  is  to  develop  a  regional  cooperation  framework,  upgrade  regional  and  national \nlaboratories, and strengthen staff capacity in the participating countries to control TAD. \n \n11.  The main outputs of the project will include (i) a regional cooperation framework (RCF) \nadopted  under  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN);  (ii)  identification  of \nnational and regional policies supporting CSF, FMD, and HPAI control among poor livestock \ncommunities in GMS; (iii) installation of regional and national disease information systems and \nenhanced  capacity  in  TAD  control  as  indicated  by  the  number  of  trained  veterinarians, \ntechnicians, extension workers, and farmers; (iv) upgrading of regional reference diagnostic \nlaboratories and a network of national diagnostic laboratories supporting control of CSF, FMD, \nand HPAI; and (v) strengthening of staff capacity. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n7  Li, K.S. et al. 2004. Nature 430: 209\u2013213. OI\u00c9 Reports. International Disease Intelligence Data. \n8  The People's Republic of China is now a formal member of the  Office International des \u00c9pizooties-led Upper \nMekong Working Group on foot-and-mouth disease and transboundary animal disease (TAD) control in the region. \n9  As described in para. 5, there is a need to take a two-phase approach to control TAD in GMS. This project \nproposes to implement the activities of phase 1 that are prerequisite to initiate a TAD control program. Phase 2 can \nbe implemented at the end of phase 1 over 2 years. The main activities of phase 2 will be targeted disease control \n(i.e., vaccination for FMD and CSF, biosecurity, culling or vaccination for HPAI) in 3\u20134 preselected disease control \nzones,  which  will  encompass  areas  along  the  predominant  migration  routes  and  poor  livestock  farming \ncommunities. The outputs of phase 2 will demonstrate the benefits of animal disease control to poor livestock \nholders and the importance of a strong partnership between public and private sectors to achieve these goals. The \nanimal morbidity and mortality rates can be reduced by about 50% for 10,000 poor livestock holders in 3\u20134 disease \ncontrol zones. The cost of phase 2 over a 2-year period is estimated to be $1,400,000 equivalent. Funding for \nphase 2 will be sought during phase 1. In a worst-case scenario, even if phase 2 is not implemented for want of \nfunding, the outputs of phase 1 will deliver significant benefits to GMS countries, justifying its investment. ", "4       \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The project will be implemented over 2 years. It will comprise two main components. \nUnder component A, a formal RCF will be developed and adopted. The activities of component \nB  will  upgrade  the  regional  and  national  laboratories,  train  the  relevant  staff,  and  build \ninstitutional capacity in the participating countries.  \n \n13.  Component  A:  Develop  a  Regional  Cooperation  Framework.  TAD  cannot  be \ncontrolled  without  common  regional  policies  and  regulations  governing  animal  movement, \nmechanism  for  sharing  disease  information,  and  standardized  protocols  for  the  use  of \ndiagnostic techniques and vaccines. Therefore, the primary objective of this component will be \nto establish an RCF among the five participating countries specifically to (i) develop a strong \nformal partnership to address common issues related to TAD control and trade of livestock and \nlivestock products in the GMS; (ii) harmonize activities of all other projects involved in TAD \ncontrol  in  the  GMS  (i.e.,  those  of  JICA,  OIE\u2013Southeast  Asian  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease \n[SEAFMD] and FAO to control CSF, FMD, and HPAI); (iii) identify enabling regional policies and \nregulations on management and control of animal movement, biosecurity measures, and use of \ndiagnostics and vaccines; (iv) develop and establish uniform disease information systems to \nenable rapid reporting and sharing of disease information at national and international levels; \n(v) establish a common set of protocols to provide emergency preparedness and response to \nemerging threats of diseases; and (vi) constitute  a project steering committee to provide \nguidance and technical advice in implementing TAD control. RCF at the end of the project will \nbe adopted under the ASEAN Sectoral Working Group on Livestock (ASWGL) to ensure long-\nterm sustainability. \n \n14.  Component B: Upgrade Regional and National Diagnostic Laboratories and Build \nCapacity. Effective animal disease control requires strengthening of veterinary services for \ndisease surveillance and to respond fast and effectively to emerging diseases. These services \nare public goods and should include well-equipped regional and national diagnostic laboratories \nsupported by trained laboratory technicians and epidemiologists. Within GMS countries, there is \na substantial variation in the levels of facilities and expertise. Therefore, detailed plans for \ntraining and capacity building will be developed to support a uniform and standardized expertise \nacross the region. This component will include (i) upgrading national diagnostic laboratories10 \n(one in each country with greater emphasis in Cambodia and Lao PDR) and regional diagnostic \nlaboratories (one in Viet Nam at the National Virus Research Institute, Hanoi; and two in \nThailand,  linked  to  the  Department  of  Livestock  Development  facility  at  Pak  Chong,  and \nNational Institute of Animal Health, Bangkok) to provide diagnostic capability and characterize \nvirus  strains  according  to  OIE-defined  standards;  (ii)  training  field  veterinarians  in \nepidemiological methodologies and the use of disease information system TADInfo to support \ndisease transmission dynamics studies; (iii) developing a sampling framework for serological \nsurvey, and initiating sample collection for serological analysis to provide a sound basis for \ndeveloping pilot disease control projects in phase 2;11 (iv) determining beforehand the economic \nimpact to define the benefits and costs of FMD, CSF, and HPAI control using different control \noptions; and (v) developing best-bet strategies for control and eradication of TAD in the GMS.  \n \n                                                 \n10  The needs for each country will vary, with Cambodia and the Lao PDR requiring more support in equipment and \ntraining. The reference lab in Viet Nam will be different from the national lab, while in Thailand, the reference labs \nand the national lab are likely to be in the same premises. Budget for construction will not be required. \n11  Links with epidemiological studies on the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus to humans will be \nestablished if funds are available. ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the project is estimated to be $2,000,000 equivalent (Appendix 2) \ncomprising $1,880,000 in foreign exchange and $120,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will \nprovide $1,000,000 equivalent to finance part of the foreign exchange costs. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. FAO has committed its Technical \nCooperation Project (TCP) funds to Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam to control \nHPAI, through procurement of diagnostic equipment, establishment of a disease information \nsystem, and supply of diagnostic reagents. FAO has also committed regular program funds \nsupporting TAD control in the GMS. FAO's foreign exchange contribution will be $880,000 \nequivalent derived from the TCPs. Government contribution from GMS countries will meet the \nentire  local  costs  of  $120,000  equivalent  to  cover  expenses  for  office  accommodation, \ncounterpart staff, part of domestic travel, survey and data gathering, and translation. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The project will be implemented over 2 years, from October 2004 to September 2006. \nThe ministries of agriculture will be the executing agencies through their respective departments \nof livestock. FAO will be appointed by direct selection to deliver the required services and \nimplement the project.12 FAO has the necessary expertise at the global, regional as well as \nnational level to provide technical and operational inputs. In the event that it is necessary to \nengage experts outside of FAO, the experts will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Equipment and material will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n17.  A project steering committee will be set up to provide overall guidance and oversight. It \nwill meet twice a year to monitor project progress. A project management office, headed by a \nproject coordinator/chief technical adviser (PC/CTA), will be set up at FAO\u2019s Regional Office for \nAsia and the Pacific in Bangkok to coordinate all project activities. Project management units, \nheaded by national project coordinators, will be set up in each of the five participating countries. \nThe project implementation flow organogram is in Appendix 3. ADB will finance 20 person-\nmonths  of  international  (PC/CTA)  and  32  person-months  of  domestic  expert  services  (in \nepidemiology and communications). FAO will finance 8 person-months of international expert \nservices (in TADInfo, laboratory disease diagnosis, and veterinary epidemiology).  Additional \ntechnical inputs on impact assessment and FMD control will be sought from ILRI and OIE, \nrespectively. Outline terms of reference for experts are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  FAO will disseminate the expected outputs through the project web site, newsletters, \nquarterly and annual reports, expert reports, reviews and terminal reports. A comprehensive \ncommunications strategy will be developed to ensure the dissemination of the project outputs to \nall stakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Governments of Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet \nNam for Transboundary Animal Disease Control in the Greater Mekong Subregion and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n12  As described in ADB-FAO Memorandum of Understanding appended to Doc.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) will set up a project management office \n(PMO) at its  Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok to implement the project \nactivities. All activities will be conducted according to the guidelines of the global framework for \nthe  control  of  transboundary  animal  diseases  (TAD)\u2014a  joint  FAO/Office International des \n\u00c9pizooties (OIE) initiative on global control of TAD. FAO will (i) ensure transparency and \naccountability, (ii) facilitate administrative procedures, and (iii) provide legal assistance, where \napplicable. The ministries of agriculture in the participating countries will be the implementing \nagencies through their respective departments of livestock. For project implementation at the \ncountry  level,  project  management  units  (PMUs)  will  be  established  and  national  project \ncoordinators  (NPCs)  appointed  in  each  of  the  participating  countries  by  their  respective \ngovernments. A formal consortium of partners involving FAO, International Livestock Research \nInstitute  (ILRI),  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  OIE,  V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires  sans \nFronti\u00e8res (VSF), a nongovernment organization (NGO), and the private sector will be formed to \nprovide technical input. The PMO will focus on integration and coordination of project activities, \nand prepare project reports, annual work plans, and budgets in consultation with PMUs. The \nPMO will be headed by a full-time project coordinator/chief technical advisor (PC/CTA) who will \n(i) provide project leadership and day-to-day management, (ii) liaise with participating countries, \nand (iii) ensure  that project funds are used in accordance with the approved work plan and \nbudget. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \n2.  A project steering committee (PSC), composed of one expert representing each of the \nfive participating countries, FAO, OIE, JICA,  Association of Southeast Asian Nations Sectoral \nWorking Group on Livestock (ASWGL), and ADB, will be established to provide: (i) overall \nstrategic and policy directions, (ii) guidance and oversight, and (iii) implementation guidelines to \nthe project and PMO. Given the significant policy implications of this project, the Chair of \nASWGL will also be appointed to the PSC. Other representatives will be appointed by each of \nthe member organizations and participating countries. The PSC will approve annual work plan, \nbudget, and quarterly and annual progress reports prepared by the PC/CTA. The PSC will \nensure quality control by establishing an independent peer review mechanism. The PSC will \nmeet twice a year in Bangkok to review and monitor project progress and approve requisite \ndocuments. The PC/CTA will prepare and distribute the agenda 2 weeks prior to the PSC \nmeeting. The cost of PSC meetings will be paid for under the project. \n \n3.  The  project  will  also  solicit  community,  VSF,  and  private  sector  participation  on \nconceptualization, design, and implementation of its activities. Communities will be involved in \nresource assessment and project design, and contribute to preparation of feasibility studies for \nintroducing disease control measures. NGOs and the private sector will play a key role in \nidentifying delivery needs and supply of technology and services for disease control in the \nselected target zones. \n \n4.  A project performance management system (PPMS) will be set up to ensure that project \nresources are managed efficiently and benefits realized. The PMO will develop the PPMS with \nassistance  from  the  PMUs.  The  PPMS  will  include  a  participatory  mechanism  involving \nbeneficiaries in project monitoring. The PMO, assisted by the PMUs, will be responsible for \nimplementing the PPMS, including the establishment of benchmarks through initial baseline \nphysical and socioeconomic surveys, data collection, and analysis. The PMO will submit a \ndetailed PPMS implementation plan for ADB and FAO\u2019s review and approval within 3 months of \nproject commencement.
