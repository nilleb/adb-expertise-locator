INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed Yichang-Wanzhou railway project (the project) is included in the Country \nStrategy  and  Program  Update  (2003\u20132005)  for  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  \nThe project, proposed for 2003, will support pro-poor economic growth in the western region by \nproviding railway access to the markets in the east of the country. \n \n2.  Due to the difficult topography and complex geological conditions of the project area, \nADB's  technical  review  was  carried  out  by  the  international  consultants  based  on  the \nGovernment's feasibility study in April 2002. The engineering review specifically focused on  \n(i) geotechnical engineering such as landform and soil conditions, and (ii) structural engineering \nsuch as tunnel and bridge construction. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for \n$250,000 was proposed upon request of the PRC Government and was approved on 21 May \n2002. The TA will refine and reinforce the Government's feasibility study and resettlement plan \nso the project will be suitable for ADB financing.1 A team of the international and domestic \nconsultants engaged under the TA were fielded on 3 July 2002. The TA is expected  to be \ncompleted in mid-November 2002.  \n \n3.  The involuntary resettlement aspects of the project need to be reinforced due to the \nscale  of  impacts  and  the  implementation  capacity  must  be  strengthened  to  meet  ADB \nrequirements. ADB, the Government, and the Ministry of Railways (MOR) have discussed the \nneeds for study and have agreed upon the scope, objectives, cost estimate, implementation \narrangements and outline of terms of reference for the new technical assistance in early \nSeptember. The new TA will complement the ongoing one, in order to ensure full compliance of \nthe project with ADB's safeguard policy. The concept paper for the TA was cleared by ADB \nmanagement on 12 August 2002 and 23 September 2002.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Out  of  10  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  railway  projects,  9  projects  have  \ncompleted involuntary resettlement to date and the resettlement associated with the remaining \none is in progress.  Implementation and monitoring mechanisms are streamlined under MOR \nand the local governments and facilitated by the Railway Construction Support Office, a county-\nbased special task force of local government officials that coordinates among MOR, the county \ngovernment, and the corresponding provincial land administration bureau. All counties of the \nproject have been influenced by the ongoing Three Gorges Dam project in Yangtze River and \neach county government, fully familiar with the PRC Land Administration Law and relevant laws, \nhas gained experience in the resettlement activities.3  \n \n5.  Through more than a decade of ADB's involvement in the railway sector in the PRC, \nsome  lessons  have  started  emerging  from  the  resettlement  on  the  past  railway  projects. \nPostevaluation of the completed ADB-financed railway project4 indicated that most complaints \nreceived by the local government were about (i) deviation of the actual compensation from the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for the Yichang-Wanzhou Railway Project, \napproved on 21 May 2002 for $250,000. \n2  This technical assistance was originally proposed in two separate small scale TAs and later combined into one. \nThe TA was first listed in ADBBO on 26 September 2002 as two separate small scale technical assistance.  \n3  The Mission distributed ADB's Handbook on Resettlement (Chinese version) to each prefecture government in \nFebruary 2002 on the TA fact-finding mission to raise the concerned officials' understanding of ADB's policy and \nguidelines. \n4  ADB. 1994. The Jing-Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project, approved on 14 July 1994 for $200 million. ", "2 \ninitial estimate, and (ii) late payment of the compensation. More emphasis should therefore be \nplaced on efficiency and accuracy in the grassroots resettlement operations. Many resettlement \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  reports  show  a  considerable  improvement  in  quality  of \nimplementation in the recent years. Such reports addressed the causes of the problems during \nthe resettlement, adequately collected the statistics and quantitative data, and highlighted the \ncomparison  with  the  resettlement  plan  at  appraisal.  However,  the  emphasis  on  livelihood \nrestoration needs to be improved and such analysis should be appropriately incorporated into \nthe scope of resettlement  planning, implementation, and  evaluation. Once ADB's policy and \nguidelines are  adopted into this already-well-established resettlement mechanism for railway \nprojects in the PRC, more sustainable and proactive resettlement practices are expected to \nensue. \n \n6.  A part  of the alignment of the project railway was modified slightly in July 2002 to \nachieve a lower gradient, which is better and physically safer option for the project line.  \nThe alignment change and the increase in length by 16 kilometers (km) have  increased the \nnumber of the affected villages, tunnels, and bridges in some parts of the project area. While the \nsocioeconomic and baseline resettlement surveys under the TA provide a reasonable estimate \nof the affected people on the modified alignment, the Government and MOR, the Executing \nAgency of the proposed loan project, are keen to fully comply with ADB's policy and guidelines \nand to achieve good practices in involuntary resettlement, particularly given the prevailing \npoverty and the  minority nationalities in the project area. Also, the TA will  assess adverse \nimpacts of involuntary resettlement and will recommend mitigation measures as necessary.  \nTo strengthen the specific action to be detailed in the recommendations, a micro-level study of \nthe resettlement impact and a village-based dialogue with the local officials, village leaders, and \nvillagers will be essential to encourage the full restoration of livelihood of the affected people, \nthereby to ensure compliance with ADB's safeguard policy. \n \n7.  The 390 km of project railway will traverse eight counties/districts of three prefectures in \nHubei Province and Chongqing Municipality. The project area is highly mountainous and 80% of \npopulation are rural, engaged in agricultural production in the terraces with a smaller amount of \nfarmland per capita than in the other provinces. A total of 1,432 villages (47%) are officially \ndesignated as poverty villages, which have marginal agricultural output and lack adequate \ninfrastructure. The initial estimate indicated that the poverty incidence in the project area is more \nthan 30%. One out of 10 people is  illiterate;  5  out  of  10  completed  only primary school \neducation.  In  five  counties5, the proportion of ethnic minorities ranges from 36% to 56%.  \nNearly 90% of the ethnic minorities consist of Tujia people. Unlike some minority nationalities, \nwhich are scattered over the PRC, the Tujia have long remained concentrated mainly in these \ncounties. Also, the Tujia are considered highly assimilated into the majority Han in every aspect \nof the daily life. Various demographic and socioeconomic statistics and indicators collected on \nthe initial  survey have shown the similar results between the majority Han and the ethnic \nminorities in the project area.  While no significant negative impacts on the ethnic minorities by \nthe project are anticipated,6 an in-depth analysis of the project impacts will  lead to a set of \nmitigation actions if needed. \n \n                                                 \n5  Changyang Tujia Autonomous County in Yichang Prefecture and Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture \nconsisting of Badong, Jianshi, Lichuan counties and Enshi City. \n6  The interview with 522 ethnic minority households in the project area indicated that the average net income of \nthose households was 7-10% higher than that of the average in the project area. ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  As  a  complement  to  the  ongoing  TA,  the  new  TA  will  (i)  ensure  the  involuntary \nresettlement under the project will fully comply with ADB policy and guidelines in a sustainable \nmanner; (ii) improve the efficiency and accuracy of processing,  recording, supervising, and \naddressing the land acquisition and resettlement tasks, which should reduce complaints from \nthe affected people and the future administrative costs for the local governments, the executing \nagency, and ADB; (iii) increase the capacity of the project counterpart agencies, including the \nlocal government dealing with the land acquisition and resettlement, for the compliance with \nADB's safeguard policy and practices; and (iv) assess the impact of changing the alignment \nfrom  the  structural  engineering  viewpoint  in  comparison  with  the  initial  technical  review.  \nThe expected outputs of the TA  are designed, as a value-added product of the ADB-financed \nconsulting services, under the concept of enhancing planning, implementation, monitoring, and \nsupervision. The logical framework for the TA is attached in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will consist of four components: (i) computerization of recording, storing and \nreporting of land acquisition and resettlement information, which includes collection of data on \nthe affected people, input into the customized database, report production for the periodic \nresettlement  monitoring  report  to  ADB,  and  training  of  the  local  government  officials;  \n(ii) preparation of village rehabilitation plans for the most severely affected villages, particularly \nvillages with ethnic minorities and/or any other  vulnerable group identified under the PPTA;  \n(iii) capacity building for resettlement planning, implementation, and monitoring; and (iv) review \nof the new alignment in comparison with the initial technical review. The methodologies used for \nthe TA will be in accordance with ADB's (i) social safeguard policy for involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous people, (ii) policies for poverty reduction and gender, and (iii) the associated \nguidelines and handbooks. \n \n10.  Component  1  aims  to  establish  an  efficient  and  accurate  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement management information system (MIS) using the computer software incorporating \nthe lessons learned from the past ADB-financed railway projects with the objective to reduce \nand/or quickly address complaints from the affected people. The services will start with analysis \nof  current  job  flows  and  practices  at  the  local  governments  and  identification  of  job \nreengineering opportunities using the computer and database software. The database formats \nwill be designed to satisfy the Land Administration Law and regulations and ADB's reporting \nrequirements. The data collection will be carried out by the domestic surveyors accompanying \nthe land staking team of MOR. The estimated land to be acquired and property loss for each \nhousehold will be recorded and stored in the database. The data will help identify the accuracy \nof the estimate drawn under the TA. This will be compared with the estimate of affected people \nand assets in the draft resettlement plan and will refine the information contained in it.7 In case \nof  any  significant  deviation  from  the  estimate  in  the  resettlement  plan,  it  will  be  revised \naccordingly before the agreement between the provincial government and MOR is signed.  \nThe local government officials will be trained by the domestic consultants for data processing, \nupdates, and maintenance so that the database will be updated at each resettlement milestone. \nThe MIS will also facilitate assessment by the independent monitoring entity and ADB during the \nimplementation  and  completion  of  the  resettlement.  This  component  will  help  the  local \n                                                 \n7  According to the current processing schedule, the draft resettlement plan will be available by November 2002. ", "4 \ngovernments implement good practices in the new project and systematize procedures to \nminimize delays and enhance implementation and supervision quality. The  MIS developed \nunder this component could be used for similar projects in the future. \n \n11.  Component 2 aims to mitigate any adverse impact of the project on land acquisition and \ninvoluntary resettlement by preparing village rehabilitation plans for the most severely affected \nvillages, with special attention  to villages with ethnic minorities and high poverty incidence.  \nThe most severely affected villages will be identified through the surveys under the earlier TA. \nRecommendations will also be prepared by the consultants of the earlier TA if any village will be \nseverely affected by the project. The new TA will focus on preparing the rehabilitation plan for \nsuch villages in close consultation with the local governments, village leaders, and affected \npeople to ensure the restoration of livelihoods.  An in-depth analysis will ensure that ADB's \nsafeguard policy for ethnic minorities is fully met. The in-depth analysis will comprise two parts: \n(i) general assessment of the project impact on the ethnic minorities in the project area, and \n(ii) detailed analysis of the Project impact on the counties along the route. If any adverse impact \non the ethnic minorities is identified, mitigation measures will be included in the resettlement \nplan or separate ethnic minorities development plan. A monitoring checklist for the ethnic \nminorities, which will be used for the periodic resettlement monitoring report, will also be \nprepared. \n \n12.  Component 3 will help the concerned officials build their capacity to plan and implement \ninvoluntary resettlement  for railway projects. This component consists of a 2 day workshop \ncomprising (i) ADB policy and guidelines for involuntary resettlement, public consultation, and \ngood  governance  for  resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring;  (ii)  the  best \npractices for involuntary resettlement under ADB-financed railway projects; and (iii) discussions \namong (a) the officials  who have handled the resettlement and/or domestic consultants  who \nmonitored and evaluated past ADB-financed railway projects,  (b) the officials of the design \ninstitutes, and (c) those who will prepare the resettlement plan for future ADB railway projects. \nThe lessons learned will be drawn from their experience and best practices will be formulated. \nThe international consultant will organize the workshops and facilitate the discussion. A model \ncontract  between  the  independent  monitoring  agency  and  the  executing  agency  for  the \nproposed loan project will be prepared in Chinese and English languages under this component, \nfor future reference in the railway projects. \n \n13.  Component 4 envisages ensuring the safety and efficiency of the construction and \noperation  of  the  project  railway  to  international  standards,  by  assessing  the  structural \nengineering aspect with particular focus on mountain tunnels and bridges that were not covered \nduring the initial technical review due to the change of the alignment. \n \n14.  The outline of terms of reference for consultants are attached in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $312,700 equivalent consisting of $101,900 in \nforeign exchange cost and $210,800 equivalent in local currency cost (Appendix 3). ADB will \nprovide $250,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $148,100 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. MOR will \nprovide the remaining $62,700 equivalent to cover the local currency cost of the counterpart \nstaff, office facilities, local communications, and support services. For disbursements of the TA \nfunds, an advance payment facility will be used to ensure smooth implementation of the TA.  ", "    5 \nThe Government and MOR were advised that approval of the TA does not necessarily commit \nADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The tasks to be performed under the TA will be component specific. Component 1 \nrequires  0.5  person-months  of  input  by  an  international  consultant,  3  person-months  by \ndomestic consultants for job analysis, programming and training, and the adequate inputs by \ndomestic surveyors and data input assistants. In total,  2.5 months of service is estimated.  \nThe services are expected to commence in November 2002 and to be completed in January \n2003. Component 2 will also require 1 person-month of an international consultant's input \ncoupled with 5 person-months of domestic consultants services. The commencement is planned \nfor  mid-November  2002  and  the  completion  for  December  2002.  Component  3 requires  \n3  person-weeks  of  input  by  an  international  consultant,  including  a  2  day  workshop.  \nThe  services  are  expected  to  be  performed  in  December  2002.  Component  4  estimates  \n1 person-month of input by an international consultant in November 2002.  International and \ndomestic consultants must have the relevant academic and professional background in social \nscience and resettlement experience, preferably in ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC. \nThe implementation schedule is attached in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  The qualified consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants in order to achieve efficient, smooth and high quality implementation in the limited \ntime and ensure continuity with the earlier TA study.  The PRC's Fourth Survey and Design \nInstitute (FSDI)8 will be contracted with for Component 1. FSDI has sufficient expertise in the \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  training  with  experience  in  the  earlier  ADB-financed railway \nprojects9  and  have  intermittently  conducted  engineering,  resettlement,  socioeconomic,  and \nenvironmental studies in the project area since 1964. Individual consultants, who have proven \nperformance in the similar ADB projects, will be hired for the other components. Equipment will \nbe procured by the consultants in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n18.  The executing agency for the TA will be MOR, which is the same EA as for the earlier \nTA and will be the same EA for the proposed loan. Local governments will cooperate with the \nconsultants as counterpart staff, under the guidance and initiative of MOR. The TA will be \nimplemented during 2.5 months, from November 2002 to January 2003. The service schedule \nand deliverables are included in the terms of reference for each component. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Strengthening  the  Involuntary \nResettlement Practices in the Yichang-Wanzhou Railway Project, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n                                                 \n8  FSDI earlier belonged to MOR as one of MOR's dedicated railway design arms. FSDI was separated out of MOR \nand has become an independent design institute to provide design, measurement, research and engineering \nservices.
