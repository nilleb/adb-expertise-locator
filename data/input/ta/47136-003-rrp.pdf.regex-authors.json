THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan, and (ii) a proposed project loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Upper \nSecondary Education Sector Development Program. The report also describes the proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Accelerating Policy Reforms in Secondary Education and if the \nBoard  approves  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  and  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The program is the response of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the government\u2019s \nvision  of  improving  the  quality  of  its  human  resources  to  sustain  Cambodia\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment and enhance its competitiveness. This will be achieved by supporting sequenced \nreforms  aimed  at  improving  the  effectiveness  of  upper  secondary  education  (USE).  The \nprogram will (i) support initiatives to improve access to, quality of, and relevance of USE; and  \n(ii) strengthen institutional capacity for planning, management, and delivery of education. While \nthe policy reforms will be applied nationwide, most of the project activities will be implemented in \nseven disadvantaged provinces.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development  problems.  Cambodia  experienced  rapid  growth  from  2000  to  2015. \nDuring 2011\u20132013, its gross domestic product grew by an average rate of 7.0% per year, and in \n2015, it grew by 7.1%. Structural transformation contributed to the country\u2019s impressive growth, \nwith services accounting for 40% of Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product, and industry for 25% \nin 2013.3 As a result of rapid growth, Cambodia\u2019s poverty rate declined from 47.8% in 2008 to \n18.9% in 2012. However, despite the rapid poverty reduction, 71% of the population, particularly \nin rural areas, lives on less than $3 a day. \n \n4.  Rapid economic growth and diversification have been accompanied by an increase in \ndemand for a skilled workforce. However, the education system has not kept up with these \nstructural changes and skills gaps have widened.4 While there was substantial progress in \nincreasing access to basic education over the last 10 years, with near universal enrollment at \nthe  primary  level  and  increased  lower  secondary  enrollment  as  of  SY2015/16,  significant \nchallenges remain at the USE level. The USE gross enrollment rate declined from 32.9% \n(30.1% female) in SY2010/11 to 25.1% (26.0% female) in SY2015/16. This dismal performance \nis  more  particularly  pronounced  in  disadvantaged  provinces,  with  recorded  average  gross \nenrollment below 20% as of SY2013/2014. Grade 12 dropout rates reached an all-time high of \n45% (42% female) in SY2015/16, an increase of 34.9 percentage points (32.2 percentage \npoints for females) from SY2011/12. Completion rates for USE remained low at 20% in SY \n2014/15.5 A 2014 study showed that many students leave upper secondary school (USS) with \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Koh Kong, Mondulkiri, Otdar Meanchey, Pailin, Preah Vihear, Rattanakiri, and Stung Treng.  Disadvantaged \nprovinces are defined as those with (i) difficult transport access, (ii) a population density of fewer than 10 people \nper square kilometer, (iii) permanent flooding or drought areas, (iv) border areas, and (v) incomplete schools \n(schools in remote or disadvantaged areas without complete grades due to lack of classrooms or teachers).  \n3  IndexMundi.

Phnom Penh. \n ", "2 \n \ninsufficient content, cognitive, trade, and workplace skills to meet expectations of employers.6 \n \n5.  Binding constraints. The government recognizes that it will require a pool of skilled \nworkers  to  sustain  its  growth  momentum,  diversify  its  economy,  and  maintain  its \ncompetitiveness. To achieve its growth objectives, the government puts a priority on resolving \nthe challenges of low access to USE, low quality and relevance of USE, and weak institutional \ncapacity to deliver education services. \n \n6.  Low access to upper secondary education. The low participation and high dropout in \nUSE are attributed to both demand- and supply-side constraints. On the demand side, the high \nopportunity  cost  of  schooling  among  poor  students  poses  disincentives  to  attending  USS. \nEconomic pressures on poor households\u2019 resources due to direct or indirect income foregone \nimpacts the decision to either attend or drop out of school. In Cambodia, a traditional code of \nconduct for women restrains their access to education opportunities. The inadequate MoEYS \nbudget for USE, and inefficiencies in spending at subnational and school levels constrain the \nexpansion of USSs in the disadvantaged provinces. This poses barriers to attendance, since \nmany USSs in the disadvantaged provinces are either too far from home, overcrowded or in a \nstate  of  disrepair,  or  lack  usable  water  and  toilets.7 The  lack  of  teachers  in  rural  and \ndisadvantaged areas due to difficult teaching and living conditions (i.e., large class sizes, double \nshifting, poor living conditions, and transportation challenges) discourage student attendance. \n \n7.  Low quality and relevance. The shortage of qualified teachers and teacher trainers \nremains  a  major  constraint  to  achieving  quality  outcomes  of  USE.  Approximately  86%  of \nCambodian teachers have qualifications below a bachelor\u2019s degree.8 In-service training and \nprofessional  development  opportunities  have  been  limited.  Pre-service  trainings  do  not \nadequately address the lack of mastery of content or knowledge of effective pedagogy to \nenhance student learning and interest. The inequity in the distribution of qualified teachers is \nalso  an  issue.  Some  specialized  subjects  such  as  in  math,  science,  and  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) are taught by teachers with not enough qualification in the \nfield.  The  inadequate  USE  budget  impedes  the  provision  of  critical  teaching  and  learning \nresources  (e.g.,  textbooks,  equipment,  science  and  computer  laboratories)  to  upgrade  the \nstudents\u2019  proficiency  in  the  specialized  USE  subjects.  Inputs  given  to  secondary  resource \nschools (SRS) are underutilized due to lack of maintenance and operation funds.9 Employer \nsurveys highlight the skills gaps due to the lack of relevance of the curriculum to the skills and \ncompetency requirements in the labor market.10  \n \n8.  Weak institutional capacity to plan, deliver, and manage education services. A \npervasive  factor  in  poor  USE  performance  is  the  weak  management  capacity  in  resource \nplanning and utilization, especially at the subnational levels. Weak school management has \nconstrained the ability of schools to flexibly respond to their needs. Monitoring capacity at all \nlevels of the MoEYS is limited, and the education management information system (EMIS) \n                                                \n6 S. Madhur. 2014.

Engagement with key stakeholders, including the \nparents and community representatives, in planning and resource mobilization has been limited. \n \n9.  Government\u2019s education strategy and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy. The \ngovernment prioritizes education and skills development in line with its Rectangular Strategy for \nGrowth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, Phase III.11 The National Strategic Development \nPlan, 2014\u20132018 emphasizes mainstreaming of scientific and technological knowledge and its \napplication in academic curriculums in secondary education.12 The Education Strategic Plan, \n2014\u20132018 focuses on policies to improve equitable access, quality and relevance and enhance \neffective leadership and management across all levels.13 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2014\u20132018 for Cambodia is aligned with the government\u2019s priorities to improve access to and \nrelevance and quality of secondary education.14 \n \n10.  ADB value added in the education sector.  ADB has provided substantial investments \nin education and technical and vocational education and training (TVET), reflecting ADB\u2019s long-\nterm  commitment to  education  in  Cambodia.  The  Education  Sector  Development  Program \n(ESDP), the second ESDP, and the ongoing third ESDP focused on increasing access to and \nquality  of  lower  secondary  education.  The  Enhancing  Education  Quality  Project  supported \nquality improvements through the establishment of SRS equipped to support student learning.15 \nThe Upper Secondary Education Sector Development Program (USESDP) will contribute to \naddressing unmet needs at the underserved USE level. It will build on the critical reforms \ninitiated in the previous ADB programs such as (i) advocating for sustained increases in budget \nallocation to education, (ii) setting standards for effective secondary schools, (iii) establishing \nprograms to address specific needs of the poor and disadvantaged, and (iv) initiating programs \nto  improve  competencies  of  teachers  and  teacher  trainers  in  secondary  education.  ADB\u2019s \nsupport to the government\u2019s public financial management reform program, including in key line \nagencies such as the MoEYS, will help address the financial management issues constraining \neffective and efficient delivery of education services, including in USE.16 \n \n11.  Lessons learned. Some lessons learned include the need to (i) align the policy reforms  \nwith government\u2019s capacity to fully implement the reforms, and provide adequate TA support to \ndevelop and implement policy reforms in key areas; (ii) build capacity of implementing agencies \nto  facilitate  project  implementation;  (iii)  provide  a  strong  fiduciary  and  fiscal  framework  to \nadvance sector reforms; (iv) strengthen the EMIS to facilitate monitoring, and enhance data-\nbased  decision-making;  and  (v)  provide  strong  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  program \ninterventions to strengthen implementation. \n                                                \n11 Government of Cambodia. 2013.

Development  partner  coordination.  Major  education  development  partners  in \nCambodia  include  the  European  Union;  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency;  the \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency; the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF); the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); and \nthe World Bank. An education sector working group serves as the main platform for regular \ndialogue and coordination. Major investments by development partners, have focused on basic \neducation. The program has been designed in consultation with these partners.  \n \n13.  The  Sector  Development  Program  modality  with  a  policy-based  loan,  project  loan \ncomponent and TA will engage ADB and the government over the next 5 years in the education \nsector and help meet the sector needs in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Identified \nreforms to the sector require long-term engagement, as these will take time to implement and \nshow development impact. The USESDP will enable ADB to leverage its contribution to support \nthe government\u2019s USE reform program and harmonize development partners\u2019 assistance.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact will be the development of high-quality human resources. The outcome will \nbe improved effectiveness of the USE system. USESDP contains 14 policy actions, all of which \nhave been completed from January 2015 to July 2016. These policy actions provide the guiding \nframework or policy bases in the implementation of the investment component of the USESDP.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1: Access to upper secondary education improved. For the policy actions \nunder  output  1,  the  government  has  established  a  three-tier  student  scholarship  program \ntargeting  (i)  poor  USE  students;  (ii)  USE  science  and  math  students  from  disadvantaged \nprovinces, using household\u2019s income poverty status, student merit, and gender as selection \ncriteria; and (iii) academically outstanding science and math students from non-disadvantaged \nprovinces to incentivize them to enroll in the science stream.17 To improve teacher deployment \nin  areas  with  high  teacher  shortage,  the  government  has  established,  budgeted  for,  and \nimplemented a hardship allowance program. \n \n16.  Under the project, the number of USE facilities in the seven disadvantaged provinces will \nbe expanded. Classrooms will be provided in 10 overcrowded USSs, while 5 existing lower \nsecondary schools will be upgraded to offer USE with classrooms and water and toilets. Eleven \nexisting  USSs  will  be  repaired  and  rehabilitated.  Scholarship  grants  will  be  provided  to \noutstanding  science  stream  students  in  USE  selected  based  on  merit,  with  60%  of  the \nbeneficiaries being female, to encourage high-performing students, including those from poor \nfamilies, to complete USE and expand the pool of better-qualified entrants for the science \nstream at the tertiary level.18 The project will provide  (i) hardship allowances to 938 USS \nteachers in the seven disadvantaged provinces, (ii) scholarships for a 1-year pre-service training \non science and math at the National Institute of Education to 500 eligible teacher candidates \nfrom disadvantaged provinces, and (iii) 44 teacher housing units in areas of high need.19 A \n                                                \n17 The science stream includes math and science. \n18 Based on their scores in the qualifying exam for scholarship grants to be given by the MoEYS. \n19 The MoEYS\u2019 criteria include the following: (i) disadvantaged provinces; (ii) USSs with shortage of teachers; (iii) \nschools with teachers transferring from other areas, especially female teachers; (iv) hard-to-reach schools within \nlimited safe geographical location; (v) schools with long teaching hours; (vi) schools with teachers who are poor \nand have low living standards; (vii) schools with newly married teachers and who come from distant areas; and \n(viii) schools with increasing student enrollment. \n ", "5 \n \ngender-responsive communication strategy and awareness campaigns will also be developed to \nenhance parents\u2019 and communities\u2019 knowledge about the value of investing in education. \n \n17.  Output 2: Quality and  relevance of upper secondary education improved. The \npolicy actions under output 2 include the government\u2019s strengthening of STEM education. The \ngovernment  has  established  policy  directions  on  in-service  and  pre-service  training  and \nprofessional development opportunities for STEM teachers and administrators, promotion of \ngender equality in STEM education, and establishment of math and science study clubs in 50 \nUSSs. Quality assurance measures in USE have been implemented through the adoption of \nguidelines on the establishment and management of SRSs, and the development of a school-\nlevel quality assurance framework focusing on systematic inspection of schools, school-level \nself-evaluation  and  standards  for  effective  support  and  service  to  teachers,  and  school \nmanagement for quality improvement based on needs assessment. Complementary reforms in \ncurriculum and assessment have been implemented, including the adoption of the curriculum \nframework for general and technical education, the conduct of the grade 11 assessment, and \nthe dissemination of the grade 12 examination results to teachers and education staff to inform \nthe  design  of  interventions  to  address  students\u2019  weaknesses  and  least-learned  skills.  To \naddress long-standing issues on low teacher qualifications, the government implemented its \ncomprehensive  teacher  policy  focused  on  improving  teacher  deployment,  quality,  and \nperformance and allocated adequate budget for its effective implementation. \n \n18.  The project will support (i) the review and upgrading of the science, math, and ICT \ncurriculum at the USE level to align with international standards; (ii) quality reviews of textbooks \nand  teacher  guides  to  ensure  curriculum  alignment  and  error-free  textbooks;  all  grade  12 \nstudents will be provided textbooks for all subjects at a 1:1 student\u2013textbook ratio while USS \nteachers will have teacher guides on all grade 12 subjects; and (iii) quality improvement of \nscience, math, and ICT teachers through review of training curriculum of pre-service and in-\nservice teacher training; professional development of USE science, math, and ICT teacher \neducators  through  pre-service  teacher  training  and  USE  science,  math,  and  ICT  teachers \nthrough  in-service  teacher  training.  The  MoEYS  will  engage  an  internationally  recognized \nregional education institute to support the implementation of these various activities. All teacher \ntraining programs will include a module on career guidance and entrepreneurship concepts for \nUSE students based on successful pilots. The project will upgrade 12 USSs to SRSs, with a \ncomplete set of learning facilities and school equipment. \n \n19.  Output  3:  Institutional  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of \neducation strengthened. Under the policy-based loan component, the MoEYS implemented \nfunctional  assessment,  performance  review,  and  capacity  development  of  relevant \ndecentralized offices of education and the Research and Teacher Assessment Office within the \nMoEYS\u2019s Teacher Training Department to enhance the effectiveness of support to teachers. To \ninform evidence-based planning and budgeting, the MoEYS updated the Education Strategic \nPlan, 2014\u20132018, including strategies, priorities, and targets. \n \n20.  The project will (i) strengthen monitoring and evaluation of SRSs and network schools20 \nthrough staff training of MoEYS departments, the provincial and district offices of education, \nSRS directors, and network schools to promote effective utilization of school resources; (ii) \nstrengthen the EMIS through server upgrading, database integration, and capacity development \nof MoEYS staff on data management and analysis; (iii) train USS management on strengthening \nSRS network schools to optimally utilize learning resources and the School Improvement Fund \n                                                \n20 Refers to a cluster of secondary schools that are in close proximity to any secondary resource school. \n ", "6 \n \n(SIF);21 (iv) provide SIF support to 48 SRSs and 240 network schools, with guidelines on \nefficient utilization and fund liquidation; (v) support the newly established MoEYS departments \nof examination, ICT, and policy through staff development training, and provision of office \nfurniture and equipment; (vi) support the Education Research Council in the production of policy \nbriefs and journals, and in the hosting of the annual research forum; and (vii) develop an SIF \nfinancial management manual for SRSs and network schools, install a computerized accounting \nsystem, and train staff in relevant MoEYS departments. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n21.  Overall program financing. The program is estimated to cost $48 million (Table 1). \nADB will provide a policy-based loan of SDR10,752,000 ($15 million equivalent) and a project \nloan of SDR21,505,000  ($30 million equivalent). Both are from the Asian Development Fund. \nThe government will provide counterpart funding of $3 million from its central budget. Table 1 \nshows the program financing plan.

The \nloan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft program loan agreement. The amount of the policy-based loan is \nbased  on  development  financing  needs  for  the  sector  as  identified  during  the  country \nprogramming  and  strategy  formulation,  and  on  the  costs  incurred  by  the  government  in \nimplementing reform priorities, including on scholarships, teacher incentives and training, STEM \ninitiatives, SRS operation, and capital expenditures such as classroom construction. The policy-\nbased loan will be released in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. \n \n23.  Project investment plan. The government has requested a loan of SDR21,505,000 \n($30  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  project, \nincluding taxes and duties. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears,  an  interest  rate of 1.0% per  annum  during the grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft project loan agreement \n(Table  2).

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n25.  The TA for Accelerating Policy Reforms in Secondary Education will provide policy, \nanalytical, and advisory support to the MoEYS on major policy areas critical to enhancing the \nquality and effectiveness of secondary education.23 These include scholarships for poor science \nand  math  USS  students;  teacher  deployment,  incentives,  and  professional  development; \ncurriculum  and  assessment;  ICT  policy  implementation;  development  of  the  medium-term \nsecondary education plan and expenditure framework, with policies, strategies, directions and \nexpenditure  requirements  and  the  three-year  education  budget  strategic  plan.  The  TA  is \nestimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). Implementation period will be from January 2017 \nto June 2018. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff,  office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The MoEYS will be the executing agency. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The program is expected to bring about significant economic benefits in terms of improved \nfuture earnings of USE students who complete the USE curriculum and who decide to find \nemployment immediately after passing grade 12. The incremental economic benefits derived from \nthe annual income generated by USE students finding employment are projected to increase from \n$0.90 million in 2021 to $130.47 million in 2041. Total economic benefits from improved income-\ngenerating capacity of USE graduates over the period is estimated at about $1,321.55 million. The \nestimated economic benefits from improved efficiency in upper secondary schools are estimated \nat about $0.57 million in 2021 and projected to increase to $11.88 million in 2041. The calculated \neconomic internal rate of return for the project investments is about 13.8%, indicating its economic \nviability. Fiscal impact analysis confirms that the government has adequate financial resources \nand will be able to fulfill all its financial obligations under the program. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n27.  The  financial  management  assessment  revealed  insufficient  financial  management \ncapacity at the subnational level. The development of the financial management manual and \ncapacity  strengthening  activities  will  be  conducted  under  the  project  to  improve  financial \nmanagement  capacity.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  and  procurement  risk \nassessment showed that the Procurement Unit of the MoEYS can handle procurement of works, \ngoods,  and  services  for  the  program  with  the  additional  full-time  support  of  a  national \nprocurement specialist. For more efficient delivery, procurement may be handled by the project \ncoordination unit that will be set up to manage the day-to-day implementation of the program. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MoEYS.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 22). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The poverty impact was assessed based on the distribution of incremental benefits and \ncosts  generated  by  the  reforms  supported  by  the  project  and  the  policy  loan  component. \n                                                \n23 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nIncremental benefits will be generated from (i) improved income-generating capacity of USE \ngraduates  who  seek  employment  rather  than  pursue  higher  education,  and  (ii)  improved \nefficiency in the management of schools and in the delivery of upper secondary education. The \neconomic analysis indicates that 16% of total program benefits are shared by the poor. \n \n30.  The policy-based loan and the project are categorized as \u201cgender equity as a theme.\u201d \nThe policy actions under the policy-based loan are designed to achieve the following objectives: \n(i) 60% of poor scholars are female, (ii) the hardship allowance program gives special emphasis \nto female teachers, and (iii) gender equality in STEM education is promoted. The gender action \nplan for the project will achieve the following: (i) undertake a gender assessment on the impact \nof student and teacher scholarships; (ii) 40% female trainees for in-service math, science, ICT, \nand  career  counseling  training;  (iii)  all  females  currently  in  management  positions  receive \nmanagement training; (iv) of the teacher candidates and/or qualified teacher training providers \nfor National Institute of Education fellowships, at least 40% are female; (v) prioritizing female \nteachers for housing units in schools; and (vi) disaggregating EMIS data by sex and ethnicity.24 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n31.  The project is classified as indigenous peoples category B. Ethnic minority students and \nstaff make up a large percentage of the project\u2019s target schools in at least five of the seven \ndisadvantaged  provinces.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \nmeasures to ensure that students, teachers, and school administrators in ethnic minority areas \nare included in the project design in lieu of preparing a separate ethnic group plan.25 The \ninvoluntary resettlement category is C. The program as a whole will not  entail involuntary \nresettlement issues. The project activities, including construction of additional USS buildings \nand teacher housing, will not require land acquisition nor restrict access to lands and/or people\u2019s \nlivelihoods since school campuses occupy large tracts of land with adequate room for future \nexpansion. Due diligence has confirmed that targeted project areas have land titles and/or \ncertificates  indicating  ownership  of  land  by  the  school  or  by  the  MoEYS.  Based  on  an \nassessment of the policy actions, the policy-based loan component will not have any potential \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples issues. \n \n32.  The project will include  the construction of school buildings and/or classrooms and \nteacher housing. While environmental impacts are anticipated during construction, these are \nprincipally confined to noise, dust, and vibration, and safety of students and school and/or \ntraining center staff. Impacts will be minor, localized, temporary, and could adequately be \naddressed and covered in the civil works contract awards. The project is classified as category \nB  for  environment.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  an  initial \nenvironmental examination have been prepared.26  The policy actions in the policy-based loan \ncomponent will not have any potential environmental impacts. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \n                                                \n24   Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  \u201cIf Indigenous Peoples are the sole or overwhelming majority of direct project beneficiaries, and when only \npositive impacts are identified, the elements of an Indigenous Peoples plan could be included in the overall project \ndesign in lieu of preparing a separate Indigenous Peoples plan.\u201d ADB. 2009.

Risk mitigating measures include (i) the \ndevelopment  of  a  medium-term  secondary  education  development  plan  and  expenditure \nframework;  (ii)  capacity  development  of  subnational  offices  and  schools  on  the  financial \nmanagement manuals; (iii) training of project coordination unit (PCU) staff on the government\u2019s \nprocurement policies; and (iv) regular monitoring of project activities by the PCU and training of \nMoEYS staff on monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n34.  The government and MoEYS have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n35.  The  government  and  MoEYS  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the project loan agreement. \n \n36.  The government and MoEYS have agreed that (i) the policy-based loan will become \neffective only when all reform actions and measures set out in the Policy Matrix (Appendix 4) \nhave been undertaken to the satisfaction of ADB; and (ii) the project loan will become effective \nwhen the program loan agreement is duly executed and delivered on behalf of the government \nand all conditions precedent to its effectiveness have been fulfilled. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the policy based-loan in various currencies equivalent to  SDR10,752,000 to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Upper Secondary Education Sector Development \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nprogram loan agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  project  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR21,505,000  to  the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Upper Secondary Education Sector Development \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nproject loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n31 August 2016\n                                                \n27  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Program is Aligned With \nHigh-quality human resources developed (Education Strategic Plan, 2014\u20132018)a \n \n  Performance Indicators with Targets and Baselines  Data Sources and   \nResults Chain  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By end of SY 2021/22:     \nEffectiveness of   a.
