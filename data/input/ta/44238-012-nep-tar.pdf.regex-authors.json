INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Nepal has requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen its capacity for planning and managing \nurban transport.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2011\u20132013.2 A \nfact-finding mission was fielded from 15 to 19 August 2011 to formulate the TA together with the \ngovernment and other stakeholders. The mission reached agreement with the government on \nthe impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services.  A  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  end  of  Nepal\u2019s  decade-long  conflict  has  brought  opportunities  for  sustainable \neconomic development. The restoration of peace is benefiting the economy as a whole and in \nparticular the services sectors. The services sectors have recorded an average annual growth \nrate of 5.5% since 2006, which is about 1.5% higher than that of overall gross domestic product \nduring the same period.3 This growth is being driven by the health, social, communication, \neducation, and tourism-related sectors. Such a growth pattern highlights the fast expansion of \nurban areas where most of these services are provided.  \n \n3.  Like most countries, cities in Nepal are the prime centers for economic growth, offering a \nmore secure and convenient life than rural areas. In 2010, only about 19% of Nepali lived in \nurban  areas,  far  behind  the  world  average  of  50.5%.  However,  the  urban  population  is \nincreasing by over 4.7% annually, which is much faster than the world average of 1.85%.4 Nepal \nstill has significant potential for further migration of the rural population to urban areas, and the \nfast pace of urbanization presents big and immediate challenges for city managers. The cities \nneed to be prepared, both in institutional capacity and physical infrastructure, to accommodate \nthe demands for quality urban life with accessible basic services such as transport, water supply \nand sanitation, and waste management. \n \n4.  In Nepal, Kathmandu Valley has led the trend toward urbanization for decades, with \nrelatively little investment being made in other urban areas. With a population of about 2 million, \nfurther development of Kathmandu Valley is now facing constraints from its physical limitations.5 \nOutside Kathmandu Valley, the pressing development issues in major urban areas are the lack \nof capacity for urban planning, and the shortage of resources for providing basic services, \nincluding  public  transport.  In  addition,  in  cities  and  towns  outside  Kathmandu  Valley, \nurbanization is expected to increase at a faster pace than before. Proactive transport planning \nand management is therefore becoming necessary and urgent to accommodate the growing \ndemand for urban transport. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 August 2011. \n2  ADB. 2010.

The TA title has been changed from \n\u201cGreen Transport Initiative\u201d in the country operations business plan (COBP) to \u201cUrban Transport Planning and \nManagement\u201d following discussions with the government. The TA type and amount remain the same as in the \nCOBP. \n3  Ministry of Finance. 2011. Economy Survey. Kathmandu. \n4  Central Intelligence Agency. 2011. The World Factbook.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan, Grant, and \nAdministration of Grant to Nepal for the Kathmandu Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Manila. \n ", "2 \n5.  In Nepal, basic urban services are jointly managed by three tiers of government: the \ncentral government, district development committees, and municipalities. The municipalities are \nresponsible for leading urban planning and development management, but most of them are \nseriously handicapped by the shortage of capacity in planning, management, and revenue \ngeneration.  No  dedicated  unit  or  section  for  urban  transport  has  been  established  in  the \nmunicipalities. \n \n6.  The Government of Nepal adopted the National Urban Policy in 2007. This gives priority \nto (i) achieving a balanced national urban structure by directing infrastructure development and \ninvestment in regional economic centers (RECs), (ii) improving the quality of urban life by \nbuilding a clean, safe, and well-developed urban environment, and (iii) establishing effective \nurban management by empowering capable local institutions.6 Five RECs were identified in the \nNational Urban Policy, including Biratnagar (Eastern Region), Birgunj (Central Region), Butwal \n(Western Development Region), Nepalgunj (Mid-Western Development Region), and Dhangadi \n(Far-Western Development Region). Among the five RECs, Biratnagar is the largest. It is also \nthe second largest city in Nepal with a population of 166,674 in 2001. The estimated population \nin 2011 is over 200,000.  \n \n7.  Biratnagar  is  located  on  the  southeastern  border  with  India,  a  traditional  hub  for \nagriculture, industry, and trade. The city is a gateway to India and other neighboring countries, \nwhich makes it a major center for international and domestic trips. The Government of India is \nassisting Biratnagar in building an integrated check-post to manage cross-border activities, and \nin connecting the city with the railway network of India. Construction of roads linking Nepal to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China is also underway. In addition, Biratnagar is close to Bangladesh \nand Bhutan. As a result of its improved connectivity to neighboring countries and its strategic \nrole as an economic hub, the urbanization of Biratnagar will proceed at a fast pace. \n \n8.  To cope with this fast-paced urbanization, the urban transport system of Biratnagar \nneeds  to  be  systematically  planned  and  effectively  managed  to  ensure  its  affordability, \naccessibility, safety, and environmental sustainability. The urban road network of Biratnagar \nincludes about 155 km of paved roads, 160 km of gravel, and 140 km of unpaved roads. Traffic \ncongestion is now becoming serious at the major junctions, but no traffic signals have yet been \ninstalled. The city has four small bus parks for intercity transport services. One of these is being \nupgraded to a main terminal with a loan from the Town Development Fund of the Ministry of \nPhysical  Planning  and  Public  Works  (MPPW).  The  intracity  transport  services  are  mainly \nprovided  by  cycle  rickshaws,  which,  together  with  pedestrians,  share  street  space  with \nmotorized traffic, thus giving rise to issues of mobility and safety.  \n \n9.  The  municipality  of  Biratnagar  Submetropolitan  City  (BSC)  is  responsible  for  urban \ndevelopment, including urban transport planning and management. However, its strategies for \nurban transport and land use are not integrated, thus hampering the BSC\u2019s efforts to manage \neffectively the city\u2019s travel demands. The main issues regarding Biratnagar\u2019s urban transport are \n(i) the absence of a comprehensive urban transport and land use strategy that covers travel \ndemand management, improvement of the urban road network, traffic management, parking \nmanagement,  public  transport  services,  and  non-motorized  traffic,  to  support  the  city\u2019s \ndevelopment goals, (ii) the lack of urban transport management capacity, including road asset \nmanagement,  traffic  monitoring  and  management,  parking  management,  environment \nmonitoring, and stakeholder coordination, both at institutional and individual levels, and (iii) \ninsufficient and poor urban transport infrastructure and facilities.

Kathmandu. \n ", "3 \ncoherent, prudent, and far-looking strategy, a detailed action plan, and adequate investment is \nrequired. Such a program, together with a capable urban transport unit in the municipality, will \nenable BSC to deliver a sustainable urban transport system. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s assistance to Nepal in the transport sector has focused on (i) improvement of the \nstrategic road network connecting urban and rural areas, and (ii) civil aviation. The Kathmandu \nSustainable Urban Transport Project is the first aimed at improving urban transport services and \ninfrastructure.7 Assistance has also been provided in major cities including Biratnagar to support \ncapacity development for urban service delivery, such as waste management, and water supply \nand sanitation.8 However, no TA has been provided to develop the capacity of major cities in \nurban transport planning and management to address the fast-growing demand for urban travel. \nThis TA will therefore complement previous and ongoing TA to improve the overall sustainability \nof the transport sector in Nepal. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The outcome of the TA will be the strengthened capacity of BSC municipality in planning \nand management for sustainable urban transport. This should enable the BSC municipality to \nimplement, regularly review, and update the strategy that will be developed under the TA. \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be improved planning and management for sustainable urban \ntransport in Nepal. By implementing the TA and disseminating the knowledge and experience \nobtained in Biratnagar, it is expected that other municipalities, particularly those of other REC \ncities, will follow a similar approach to urban transport planning and management. Furthermore, \nfuture investment in urban transport by the government, ADB, and other development partners \nwill be guided by the comprehensive urban transport strategies formulated by the REC cities. \nThe improved urban transport system will support the efficient movement of people and goods, \nand result in reduced congestion, fewer traffic accidents, efficient use of fuel, and better air \nquality. Ultimately, the impact of the TA will contribute to regionally balanced economic growth \nand reduced social inequity, which is in line with the transport sector outcomes that ADB \nsupports in its country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132012.9 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will assist the municipality of BSC through (i) preparing a comprehensive urban \ntransport and land use strategy, and (ii) enhancing BSC\u2019s institutional capacity to update and \nimplement the strategy.  \n \n14.  Comprehensive urban transport and land use strategy. The TA will first prepare a \ncomprehensive urban transport and land use strategy, including long-term visions, medium-term \ngoals,  an  action  program,  and  an  implementation  plan  for  improving  Biratnagar\u2019s  urban \ntransport  system.  The  strategy  will  address  the  balanced  requirements  of  different  urban \n                                                 \n7  The Kathmandu Sustainable Urban Transport Project will improve Kathmandu Valley\u2019s public transport services \nand walking conditions through (i) strengthening the capacity of the Department of Traffic Management, (ii) \nimproving traffic management, (iii) improving pedestrian facilities, and (iv) enhancing air quality monitoring. \n8  ADB. 2010.

The  key \nactivities include: (i) reviewing the existing urban development vision, strategy, and periodic plan, \nthe land use plan, and other relevant policies, regulations, and studies; (ii) undertaking surveys \nin Biratnagar on the urban transport system, land use patterns, and environmental impacts; (iii) \nassessing  the  base  year  land  use  and  urban  transport  system  and  future  scenarios  with \ntransport demand models; (iv) developing long-term visions and medium-term goals for urban \ntransport and land use, in line with the urban development plan, the national urban policy, and \nthe  findings  of  the  consultations  and  surveys;  (v)  preparing  an  action  program  and  an \nimplementation  plan  to  achieve  the  medium-term  goals;  (vi)  recommending  financing \nmechanisms  for  the  improvement  and  operation  of  the  urban  transport  system;  and  (vii) \ndeveloping a performance monitoring system to keep track of implementation progress. The \nproposed strategy will be presented to the government and other stakeholders for consideration. \n \n15.  Institutional enhancement. In accordance with the requirements for implementing the \ncomprehensive urban transport and land use strategy, the TA will prepare an action program for \nthe institutional enhancement of BSC municipality in urban transport planning and management, \nand will help with its implementation. The key activities will involve (i) assessing the capacity of \nBSC  municipality  in  urban  transport  planning,  management,  procurement,  and  project \nmanagement;  (ii)  identifying  issues  relating  to  the  existing  capacity  of  the  municipality  for \nimplementing the comprehensive urban transport strategy; (iii) preparing an action program for \ninstitutional  enhancement  of  the  municipality,  focusing  on  urban  transport  planning  and \nmanagement;  (iv)  helping  the  municipality  to  implement  the  action  program;  (v)  preparing \nguidelines and toolkits on public transport services, urban transport infrastructure management, \nnon-motorized  transport,  traffic  management,  parking  management,  and  performance \nmonitoring;10 (vi)  conducting  workshops  and  on-the-job  training  on  the  application  of  the \nguidelines and toolkits on urban transport management; (vii) helping to arrange for staff of the \nmunicipality to  participate in training that will develop their individual capacity, such as the \ntraining  programs  provided  by  the  City  Development  Initiatives  in  Asia  (CDIA);11 and  (viii) \norganizing  a  nationwide  workshop  to  disseminate  the  knowledge  and  experience  acquired \nthrough the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  It is proposed that ADB provide technical assistance in the amount of $800,000 on a \ngrant basis, from the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation  and  transport,  and \nremuneration and per diem of counterpart staff. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The MPPW, through its Department of Urban Development and Building Construction \n(DUDBC), will be the executing agency to supervise and coordinate TA activities. The DUDBC \nwill  appoint  a  TA  coordinator  whose  main  responsibilities  will  be  (i)  liaising  with  the  TA \nconsultant team, ADB, and other development partners on TA activities; (ii) assisting the TA \nconsultants at the central government level in data collection, consultation meetings, seminars, \nand workshops; and (iii) organizing meetings of the TA steering committee. \n                                                 \n10  The guidelines and toolkits will be based on international best practices, and be adapted to the local requirements \nof Biratnagar and the national context of Nepal. \n11  The CDIA has expressed interest in providing training opportunities and potential technical assistance for a pre-\nfeasibility study on priority investment projects related to the TA. \n ", "5 \n18.
