THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Education indicators for Pakistan are grim, with a low adult literacy rate, low expected \nyears of schooling, and considerable challenges in terms of access and quality of learning.1 \nEducational challenges in Sindh are more acute than in Pakistan generally. They include limited \naccess  to  education,  poor  quality  education,  and  weak  education  sector  governance  and \nmanagement. The performance of the education sector is weak in Sindh, especially at the \nsecondary education level. Access to education is low and there are wide disparities across \ngender, geography, and socio-economic quintiles. The quality of education in Sindh is poor and \nlearning levels are low across all subjects, and particularly for mathematics and science. This is \ndue to several factors, including the poor quality of the teaching force, an outdated secondary \nexamination system and weak sector governance and management. \n \n2.  The proposed Sindh Secondary Education Improvement Project (SSEIP) will support the \nSindh School Education and Literacy Department (SSELD) to implement aspects of the Sindh \nEducation Sector Plan (SESP) 2014\u20132018 by increasing access to, and improving the quality of, \nsecondary education in the province. Project outputs are: (i) network of quality secondary schools \nexpanded; (ii) teacher, quality, management and accountability enhanced; and (iii) secondary \neducation sector governance strengthened.

The Government of Sindh (the Government) will contribute in-kind \nassistance of $15 million. The project will be implemented from 2019 to 2024.
