During the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country programming missions in 2004, the \nGovernment of Pakistan reconfirmed its request for assistance to prepare a power transmission \nsystem project to enhance overall power system efficiency. A project preparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA) for the Power Transmission Enhancement Project1 is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program update2 (CSPU), 2005\u20132006 and an ensuing loan project is \nincluded in the lending program for 2006. An ADB fact-finding mission visited Pakistan from \n31 May to 9 June 2005, and reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, \nscope, cost, financing, implementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 outline terms of \nreference for the PPTA. The PPTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) is responsible for national \npower transmission, the dispatch center, and it is the single electricity buyer and seller. NTDC \nwas established through a restructuring and unbundling of the power wing of the Water and \nPower Development Authority (WAPDA).  NTDC is responsible for linking the power generation \nfacilities with load centers throughout the country, and is composed of lines and grid stations of \n500 kilovolt (kV) and 220 kV capacities. NTDC is responsible for the construction, operation, \nand maintenance of transmission facilities throughout Pakistan. It also constructs 132 and 66 kV \ngrid stations and transmission lines for the distribution companies.  At the end of June 2004, \nNTDC operated and maintained nine 500 kV and 24 220 kV grid stations and 10,167 km of \ntransmission lines. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Framework  2005\u201320103  (MTDF)  sets  out  a \nchallenging infrastructure investment program, in order to achieve a consistent 8% annual \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP). The overarching philosophy of the Government is \npoverty reduction through economic development.  An increase in the supply of infrastructure \nservices creates economic opportunities in both urban and rural areas. The power sector is a  \nfundamental infrastructure sector and the transmission system needs to be strengthened and \nexpanded to support the Government\u2019s economic growth target and its poverty reduction efforts.  \n \n4.  Electricity demand in Pakistan is forecast to grow by 8.3% a year during the period \n2005\u20132015. To cope with this growth in demand, it is estimated that Pakistan would require \nabout 2,000 additional megawatts (MWs) annually, which would need to be evacuated through \nthe transmission system. Substantial investments are required to strengthen the transmission \nsystem to (i) evacuate the power generated by additional power plants, and (ii) supply electricity \nto meet the growing demand.  NTDC currently has a transmission development program for the \nperiod 2005\u20132012 and several schemes included in the program have been approved by the \nGovernment.  \n \n5.  Pakistan\u2019s transmission system faces three major challenges: (i) the heavy power flow \nthrough the 500 kV system, (ii) a shortage of supply capacity for the 220 kV system, and \n(iii) high transmission losses.  As most of the major hydropower plants are located in the \nnorthern part of the country, there is heavy power flow from north to south during summer when \nhydropower  plant  generation  is  high,  and  heavy  flow  from  south  to  north  in  winter  when \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 9 June 2005. \n2  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Pakistan. Manila. \n3  Planning Commission of the Government of Pakistan. 2005. Medium Term Development Framework (2005\u20132010). \nIslamabad. ", "2   \nhydropower generation is low. Although the capacity of the 500 kV system is expected to \nincrease by 2006 after the commissioning of two 500 kV transmission lines, this issue may recur \nin the near future because of the uneven distribution of additional power plants. There are  \nsystem  constraints  in  the  220kV  system,  mainly  shortages  of  supply  at  the  220/132  kV \nsubstations  and  related  220kV  transmission  line  systems.  These  supply  shortages  cause \n(i) load  shedding,  (ii)  low  voltage  profiles,  and  (iii)  high  transmission  system  losses.  The \nGovernment has approved some enhancement schemes to address these, but forecasted high \ngrowth in electricity demand will require further strengthening of the 220 kV system.  \n \n6.  Transmission and distribution losses in Pakistan amounted to 24.3% in FY2003\u20132004.  \nThese substantial losses are mainly caused by the excess load on transmission lines and \ntransformers. Because of aging and overloading, the transmission system is unstable and \nunreliable, and it is of crucial importance that it is improved in these respects. Consumers \nrequire a reliable supply of power, as do the production and service sectors.  \n \n7.  Two  issues  affecting  the  financial  and  economic  sustainability  of  the  power  sector \nrequire detailed attention. First, the operational and financial autonomy of NTDC needs further \nrefinement. NTDC, as part of the overall power sector, is going through a transformation from a \nsingle  integrated  utility  to  an  unbundled  sector  operating  as  a  single  buyer.  Although  the \ntransformation is ongoing, the transfer of tasks and duties needs to be speeded up, which will \nresult  in  a  shorter  transition  period  and  greater  system  efficiency.  Before  the  proposed \ntransmission enhancement project is considered by ADB, it is expected that NTDC\u2019s degree of \nautonomy will have increased from its current level.  \n \n8.  Second, the financial viability of NTDC and the single buyer model affect the financial \nand economic sustainability of the power sector. According to its license, NTDC has three main \nfunctions; (i) the transmission function, (ii) the load dispatch function, and (iii) the single buyer \nand single seller functions. The first two are generally accepted and understood and for the third \nthe Government is developing a  central power purchase agency (CPPA). The  consultants \nengaged under the technical assistance for capacity building of NTDC4 are assisting in this. The \nCPPA functions need to be clearly defined before any decision on, or implementation of, the \nproposed transmission enhancement project. The overall tariff to be charged by the distribution \ncompanies to the consumers will be linked to the financial viability of NTDC. This issue is \ncurrently being reviewed by the Government with a view to limiting the deficit of the power \nsector and its impact on the national budget.  A decision is expected soon and it is envisioned \nthat this issue will be resolved during the PPTA period.  \n \n9.  Compared with best international practices, NTDC currently pays limited attention to \nsafeguard issues. Stricter compliance with internationally acceptable safeguard policies and \nprocedures will be required if NTDC is to obtain international funding for transmission projects. \nBefore any financial assistance is provided, due diligence should be carried out to assess the \nimpacts  of  the  transmission  projects  and  to  ensure  that  negative  impacts  are  properly \naddressed as per ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and procedures. ADB safeguard policies cover the \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples5  (IPs).  At  present,  NTDC \naddresses involuntary resettlement and IPs on a case-by-case basis. Because of its lack of \ninternal resources and specialized personnel, assessments of environmental and social impacts \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "3\nare outsourced to consulting firms, which undertake the due diligence and report to NTDC, after \nconducting full consultations with all the stakeholders involved. \n \n10.  In terms of environmental assessment, NTDC carries out a pre-assessment to define a \nprovisional routing. Consultants then prepare a more detailed assessment of the environmental \nimpacts. The Pakistan Environmental Protection Act of 1997 defines the legal procedure to be \nundertaken,  in  terms  of  environmental  impact  assessment,  before  the  submission  and \nimplementation of any project. The act provides guidance and principles on environmental \nimpact assessment, which are supported by guidelines issued by the Pakistan Environmental \nProtection Agency and provincial environmental protection agencies. \n \n11.  With regard to land acquisition, Pakistan currently relies on the Land Acquisition Act of \n1894, and the Telegraph Act (or Electricity Act) of 1910. A new national law on Land Acquisition \nand Resettlement was drafted in 2002 in cooperation with ADB and the World Bank. This law is \nyet to be approved. The acts currently used by the Government allow for provisions to be \nadopted within each project that meet ADB safeguards requirements. NTDC has implemented \nprojects  with  international  financial  institutions  in  the  past,  and  it  fully  accepts  that  the \nsubsequent  projects  will  have  to  develop  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nstandards. Concerns that will need to be addressed during the implementation of the PPTA are \nrelated to (i) untitled land users, (ii) agricultural labor presently employed (formally or not) in the \naffected areas, (iii) equitable household compensation, and (iv) marginalized minorities.  \n \n12.  IPs, as defined by ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), are the responsibility of \nthe Ministry of Religious Affairs. Because there is no clear definition of mainstream population or \nminorities  in  Pakistan,  mapping  of  IPs  who  are  relevant  to  NTDC\u2019s  operations  may  be \nnecessary. Discrimination against IPs must be avoided, particularly when compensation and job \nopportunities are being awarded. The same applies to women and other vulnerable groups. \n   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  purpose  of  the  PPTA  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  increasing \nelectricity  supply  to  its  urban  and  rural  population.  It  will  do  this  by  preparing  a  power \ntransmission enhancement project to ensure the transmission system delivers a sufficient and \nstable power supply. The project will improve system stability and reliability, and reduce losses \nthrough (i) the construction of 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines, (ii) the construction of 500 \nkV  and  220  kV  substations,  (iii)  an  extension  of  500  kV  and  220  kV  substations,  and \n(iv) preparation of a master plan on a nationwide transmission system. A similar intervention for \nthe distribution system has been included in the 2007 ADB lending program. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  Key activities to be undertaken under the PPTA cover four major areas: (i) technical \nproject design; (ii) economic and financial evaluations; (iii) compliance with national and ADB \nsafeguard policies; and (iv) links among economic growth, poverty, and the power sector. In \nfinalizing the technical project design, a detailed review of load forecasts will be undertaken with \na view to ensuring least-cost technical design and economic viability of the proposed investment \nproject. Feasibility studies will be reviewed, and a procurement plan prepared. ", "4   \n15.  In addition to financial analysis of the Project, the financial management capabilities and \nthe financial performance of NTDC will be assessed. Financial management is important as \nNTDC was recently unbundled from WAPDA, and separate financial management systems are \nneeded for its transmission operations and its single buyer function. The tariff structure will be \nreviewed  to  determine  whether  the  actual  cost  of  supply  is  being  recovered  and/or  being \nsubsidized  through  a  transparent  mechanism.  Interaction  with  the  National  Electric  Power \nRegulatory Authority will ensure understanding and  knowledge about the tariff application and \ndetermination issues. Economic subsidies in the current tariff structure and the extent of cross-\nsubsidization between major consumer groups and regions will be analyzed. Existing estimates \nof the costs of unserved energy due to the unreliability of the system will be updated, and \nseveral scenarios for the load growth forecast will be developed, paying particular importance to \npotential impacts of external shocks on the economy.   \n \n16.  Detailed field surveys will be undertaken to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard \npolicies for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and IPs. The surveys will be carried out \nalong the planned alignment of the transmission lines, the sites of the new grid stations, and the \naccess roads to identify any environmental impacts, and to prepare a full inventory of all land, \nbusinesses, shops, and households that will be permanently or temporarily affected by the \nproject. The Project will be designed, transmission lines aligned and routed, and substations \nlocated in order to minimize adverse environmental and social impact. Mitigation measures and \nimplementation arrangements will also be assessed. An initial environmental examination and a \nsummary initial environmental examination will be prepared. A full resettlement plan will be \nprepared, since both temporary and permanent impacts on affected persons are expected to be \nsignificant.6 The resettlement plan will include design of public information, disclosure and \ngrievance procedures, and costing of compensation. The project\u2019s impacts are not expected to \ncause any specific cultural or social impacts on any socioeconomic group, including indigenous \npeople, or to exclude any from benefiting from the proposed investment project. Particular \nattention will be devoted to minorities, women, and other vulnerable groups. An indigenous \npeoples development plan (IPDP) may be required.  \n \n17.  The rationale for the proposed 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines and the new \n500 kV and 220 kV substations is closely related to specific generation expansion projects. \nThus, any delay in the construction of those plants, or change to the location of the plants, might \nmake the proposed investments in the transmission line and substation unjustifiable. This is a \npotential risk for the project\u2019s economic and financial viability. Since the MTDF sets out the \npower sector investment needs over a specified period of time, a sector project approach for the \nensuing loan would introduce sufficient flexibility in case these generation plants are delayed. \nUnder the PPTA, suitable selection criteria for specific area coverage and components will be \ndeveloped and decided upon by the Government, NTDC, and ADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $675,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $307,000 and the local currency cost is $368,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas asked ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost \nand a portion of the local currency cost amounting to $193,000 equivalent. The PPTA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \n                                                 \n6  Resettlement is \u201csignificant\u201d where 200 or more people experience major impacts. Impacts are defined as major \nwhen the affected people are physically displaced from housing and/or more than 10% of their productive (income-\ngenerating) assets are lost. \n ", "5\nGovernment and NTDC will finance the remaining $175,000 equivalent of local currency costs \nthrough in-kind contributions by NTDC, including office accommodation and facilities, local \ncommunication, counterpart staff, data, and other information needed for the PPTA. Detailed \ncost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s \napproval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOWP will be the Executing Agency, and NTDC the Implementing Agency for the \nproposed PPTA. NTDC has adequate experience with implementing similar externally funded \nprojects from its earlier role as an integrated part of WAPDA. In addition, MOWP will provide \nassistance to the PPTA consultants in liaising with other Government ministries and agencies \nand with provincial authorities, and in obtaining data and documentation from these ministries, \nagencies, and provincial authorities. NTDC, with assistance from MOWP, will liaise with the \nprovinces  affected  by  the  proposed  investment  project  to  ensure  coordination  and \nunderstanding of the proposed project.  \n \n20.  The PPTA will require about 11 person-months of international and 29 person-months of \ndomestic  consulting  services,  which  are  expected  to  begin  on  1  November  2005  and  be \ncompleted by 30 April 2006. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are provided in \nAppendix 3. Tripartite meetings, involving NTDC, MOWP, and ADB, will be held after the \nsubmission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. The consultants will prepare status \nreports for their specific scope of works, highlighting any issues that could become critical for \nthe timely completion of the PPTA. The consultants will arrange for workshops and on-the-job \ntraining for NTDC and MOWP staff and for provincial and local governments. The international \nconsultants will have expertise in project and energy economics and macroeconomic modeling, \nfinancial analysis and financial management, power system and transmission system planning, \npower  system  analysis,  transmission  line  and  substation  design,  environmental  impact \nassessment, resettlement, and other social issues. A consulting firm or consortium of firms will \nbe engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Recruitment of \nconsultants will be according to quality- and cost-based selection procedures, and simplified \ntechnical proposals will be requested. Equipment to be financed under the TA will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the Power Transmission Enhancement Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe Government is committed in reducing poverty through economic development. Infrastructure development has \nbeen assessed as one of the primary needs that need to be addressed if the Government is to tackle poverty by \nenhancing economic growth. The power sector, in particular, will need considerable investment if it is to meet growth \nrequirements. Electrification is an important part of achieving other development goals and therefore constitutes a \nnational goal. \n \nDespite electrification and electricity consumption not really being considered as outcomes, the transmission subsector \nis considered to be fundamental for poverty reduction and economic growth as an input. Consumption patterns are also \nskewed in terms of nonpoor and poor consumers, as electricity consumption by the poor tends to be determined by \naffordability of appliances. Despite these patterns, the high connection ratios across most provinces suggest that \ncapital investments in the power sector to meet future demand of existing and new consumers can be regarded as \nincluding the poor, both directly as consumers and indirectly through the contribution they make to enabling off-farm \nemployment opportunities in the private sector and to economic growth.  \n \nPoor quality and unreliable supply of power tend to disproportionately burden the poor because they are less able to \nresort to alternative sources of power. They also have fewer income sources so the loss of one may more impacts on \npoor than on nonpoor households. A reliable supply of power helps to attract commercial and industrial activities, which \nin turn may enable the poor to diversify income sources by offering more employment opportunities. The ability of \nprovincial governments to fulfill economic development plans to support social development and off-farm job creation \ndepends on the availability of sufficient power.  \n \nIn addition, a more reliable and secure supply of energy can drastically improve the quality of sanitation, healthcare and \nother social services, particularly education. \n \nFinally, a more reliable power supply can sharply increase the household living standards, by, among others, providing \nnew opportunities to generate income. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nPakistan has a complex social structure. To better understand the Project\u2019s impact on poverty and its diverse social \ndimensions, the TA will need to use local consultants to prepare a social impact assessment and a poverty impact \nassessment, paying special attention to gender.  \n \nA socioeconomic survey will be carried out and will include analysis of resettlement and indigenous peoples, although, \nat present, no indigenous peoples are thought to be affected by the Project. A poverty impact assessment will be \nundertaken separately. Form the results of these analyses, the consultants will prepare a full resettlement plan, \nincorporating mitigation measures and their costs into the project\u2019s cost estimates. The poverty impact assessment will \ninclude a poverty profile, an assessment of the direct and indirect impacts on the poor, and detailed information on \nbeneficiaries, particularly the poorest and the most vulnerable (paying greater attention to women).  \n \nFinally, willingness to pay, tariff and affordability analyses will also be carried out to improve understanding of the \ngeneral impacts (positive and negative) on the poor and other vulnerable groups. \n \nC.
