INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  the  Government  of \nMongolia develop a sustainable and economically viable fodder industry. The TA will raise \ntechnical capacity and increase knowledge to address industry issues of (i) a fodder demand\u2013\nsupply gap and (ii) guidelines and quality standards for production, processing, storage, and \nsupply to ensure sustainable fodder management. A sustainable fodder industry will help herders \nbuild resilience against climate risks and help fodder producers develop the agribusiness value \nchain, which all contribute to opportunities to improve income generation and diversify the \neconomy. \n \n2.  The government requested TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the \nsustainable development of its fodder industry.1 The TA is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2020\u20132021.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Mongolia relies heavily on its agriculture sector, which contributes over 12% of its gross \ndomestic product. Livestock\u2019s share in agriculture output is 84.2%: it provides employment to one \nthird of Mongolia\u2019s economically active population and involves 230,800 herder households.3 \nLivestock numbers have increased to 66.46 million, with meat and milk as the primary products.4 \nThe livestock industry remains an important priority to reduce rural poverty, boost incomes, and \ndiversify economic growth by producing food and exporting high-quality meat and wool products, \nyet productivity remains low. Degraded pastureland and the lack of an adequate quantity and \nquality of feed resources are among the major factors causing poor livestock productivity.5 With \nincreasing livestock numbers, it is important to ensure fodder resources can support higher stock \nnumbers; can manage the seasonal variation in production, supply, and demand; and do not \ncause a decline in pastureland quality and livestock health from poor nutrition. At present, fodder \nresources do not meet these conditions. \n \n4.  Livestock fodder comprises unprocessed or processed forms of native hay; planted hay \nfrom annual and perennial grasses and legumes; fodder crops such as barley, oats, corn, beans \nand sunflowers; and crop by-products such as bran. Since the transition from the planned to \nmarket economy in 1990, with an extended absence of management and investment, the \nlivestock product market and the provision of inputs and services to it have drastically decreased.  \nHerders now have the responsibility to secure inputs and services, however they lack the skills \nand incentives to take up activities for supplementary feed and fodder production. The limited \nsupply has been compounded by herders and farmers considering fodder production to be a high-\nrisk activity because of unfavorable weather conditions, limited production areas with adequate \ninfrastructure, outdated technology and equipment, and limited market opportunities. \n  \n \n1    The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 September 2019. \n2   ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2020\u20132021. Manila. \n3   National Statistics Office of Mongolia. 2017. Mongolian Statistical Yearbook 2017. Ulaanbaatar.   \n4   Livestock composition is 46.0% sheep, 40.8% goats, 6.6% cattle, 5.9% horses and 0.7% camels. Livestock are \ndistributed through all aimags (provinces), with camel and goat production emphasized in the southern Gobi aimags, \nhorse production emphasized in the north, south central, and eastern aimags, and cattle production emphasized in \nthe northern aimags. Sheep production is relatively evenly distributed throughout the country. \n5   Pastures represent 96.3% of Mongolia\u2019s 115.8 million hectare of agricultural land. However, about 70% of the \npastures are degraded and have seen a reduction of up to 80% of plant-based biomass in the Mongolian steppe \ngrassland ecosystems. \n \n ", "2 \n5.  The availability of high-quality fodder is crucial for Mongolia to develop and upgrade its \nlivestock sector because improved, higher quality fodder production with a stable supply will \nimprove animal nutrition and health and reduce animal mortalities. Improved livestock health will \nresult in higher quality meat and fiber products and provide increased resilience and security \nagainst dzuds (extreme winter weather conditions), which causes large stock losses. At present, \nfodder production is insufficient, of low quality, with unreliable product supply. In 2016, the fodder \nmarket was worth about $120 million  and although domestic supply accounted for 98% of the \navailable product on the market, it only meets 86% of roughage demand and 51% demand for \nconcentrates. 6 With livestock numbers estimated to increase by 5% to 10% per year, with \nincreasing intensified livestock farming (dairy, beef, pig, and poultry farms) and demand for high-\nquality feed (concentrates, silage, high-protein feeds, green fodder, and grains), the demand far \nexceeds current production capacity levels. An estimated additional $19 million\u2013$23 million per \nyear in fodder resources will be needed to meet the demand.7 \n \n6.  Government policy aims to help increase domestic fodder production rather than increase \nimports. Crop policies and crop farmers are giving more attention to the need to increase fodder \ncropping. However, without a conducive policy environment, technical know-how, and private \nsector  engagement,  domestic  fodder  producers  remain  constrained  in  filling  the  gaps  in \nproduction, processing, and storage across the diverse agro-ecological regions.8 Furthermore, \nbecause most of the arable land is degraded, and equipment and infrastructure limited and \noutdated, it will be a challenge to increase domestic production levels. A new approach to promote \nfodder production and industry management is required for a sustainable fodder industry that will \nhelp  herders  build  resilience  against  climate  risks  and  help  fodder  producers  develop  the \nagribusiness value chain. \n \n7.  An integrated approach to land, pasture, and fodder management, with improved herd \nmanagement and increased resilience to climate change, will be fundamental to the industry\u2019s \nlong-term sustainability. The integrated approach aims to improve the feed supply and also \nemphasize the need for a sustainable balance between livestock numbers on one hand and \npastureland quality and livestock feed availability on the other hand. This approach should \naddress the need for: (i) increasing knowledge and capabilities to manage natural resources and \ntheir  relationship  to  fodder  production;  (ii)  strengthening  institutional  coordination  among \ngovernment agencies, fodder producers, and herder groups; (iii) improving extension services for \nknowledge  transfer,  awareness  raising,  and  capacity  building;  (iv)  building  on  institutional \narrangements, such as through cooperatives and private sector engagement to support the fodder \nvalue chain; (v) monitoring and coordinating fodder supply with livestock movements to match \nsupply with demand, including logistics, transportation, and storage; and (vi) raising awareness \namong stakeholders to encourage industry coordination and foster a positive attitude about \nengaging in sustainable fodder management. To address these needs, the TA will generate new \ntechnical knowledge, build capacity, and raise awareness about natural resources management \nto facilitate the adoption of sustainable fodder production and value chain development, promote \ninstitutional coordination, and propose enabling policies.  \n \n \n6    The fodder market is composed of 1.18 million tons of roughage, 38,100 tons of fodder, 105,600 tons of mineral \nfodder, and 94,300 tons of concentrates, of which only $5.4 million  worth came from imported concentrate products \n(8%) and roughage (2%). \n7   Erdenebolor Baast. 2017. Market Study on Livestock Fodder Production and Demand in Mongolia.  \n8    The five major agro-ecological zones of the Central and Eastern Steppe, Gobi Desert, Hangai-Khuvsgul, Mongolian \nAltai, and Selenge-onon have distinct geographic patterns and agricultural production potential and requirements. \n \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: sustainable and economically viable fodder \nindustry in Mongolia improved (Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030).9 The TA will \nhave the following outcome: sustainable fodder management practices (production, processing, \nstorage, and supply) adopted.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Fodder  production,  supply,  and  demand  assessed.  The  diagnostic \nassessment will apply a spatial approach\u2014including the use of remote sensing and smartphone \nbased observations, field survey, and literature review\u2014to survey the ecological regions of \nMongolia to (i) assess the current fodder production and market on the composition, use, and \nnutritional value of indigenous and imported fodder grass species in pastureland and irrigated \nland; (ii) review current fodder production practices in growing, harvesting, quality testing, and \nstorage; (iii) evaluate land use for potential new fodder production area expansion; and (iv) \nevaluate fodder supply against the dynamic demand of feed by varying livestock population and \nspecies, considering nutrient values, and identifying the surpluses and deficits. The assessment \nwill also identify the policy, market, institutional, economic, and social factors affecting fodder \nproduction and trade, as well as the risks facing farmers, herders, and traders. Based on the \nassessment, the TA will propose recommendations to improve the production, supply, and sector \nmanagement of the Mongolia fodder industry. \n \n10.  Output 2: Technical solutions for sustainable fodder management developed. This \noutput will assess and propose technologies, quality standards, guidelines, and trainings for \nsustainable fodder management. It will focus on addressing the technical know-how required to \nincrease  fodder  production  and  improve  harvesting,  processing,  and  storage  techniques, \ntechnologies, and capacities. Key topics include: (i) indigenous and imported high-quality hay and \nfodder varieties which are suitable to the local environment with enhanced climate resilience, \nalong with good agronomic practices; (ii) improved harvesting and processing procedures such \nas nutrient add-ons; (iii) improved storage practices which can prolong the nutritional quality of \nfodder  under  varying  storage  conditions;  (iv)  guidelines  on  improved  practices  for  fodder \nharvesting, processing, and storage; and (v) fodder quality standards and testing procedures. \nBased on the recommendations, the TA will develop a training and awareness raising program \ntargeting fodder producers, processors, storage facilities, herders, and extension workers. \n \n11.  Output 3: Enabling policies and action plans formulated. This output will focus on \nproviding policy recommendations and a fodder sector development action plan to improve fodder \nmanagement. The output will identify policy domains and prioritize investment needs to ensure \nreliable and quality fodder production in Mongolia. Key considerations will include institutional \nstrengthening to integrate multi-agency collaborations; monitoring and forecasting of fodder \nproduction, demand, quality, and nutritional requirements; access to and sustainable use of \nnatural resources for fodder cultivation; supply and demand trends for fodder, herder, and \nlivestock migrations; provision of extension services at aimag (province) and soum (district) \ngovernments; and an awareness campaign on safe and efficient use of feed and sustainable \nfodder management. \n \n9   Government of Mongolia. 2016.

The TA builds on lessons from previous project support to the livestock \nsector, noting the need to: (i) coordinate technical assistance between donor and development \nagencies not only to provide technical expertise, but also to build institutional capacity to ensure \nresults can be mainstreamed within government agencies to ensure continuation of activities and \nimprove the sustainability of outputs; (ii) involve senior national and soum government officials, \nconcerned government agencies, and local experts in the TA work to ensure quality outputs that \nmeet the needs of various stakeholders; and (iii) strategically plan dissemination to enhance \nknowledge-sharing activities and showcase the findings and recommendations, to generate \ngreater benefits.  \n \n13.  Strategic  fit.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  Government  of  Mongolia\u2019s  Sustainable \nDevelopment Vision 2030 to develop productive farming and livestock sectors (footnote 9). It \naddresses the Action Program of the Government for 2016\u20132020 to establish regional livestock \nfodder industry and increase the reserve of hay and fodder. The design of the TA follows ADB\u2019s \nOperational Plans for Agriculture and Natural Resources; ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nMongolia, 2017\u20132020; and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which aims to promote poverty reduction, rural \ndevelopment, inclusive growth, and sustainable agriculture practices, particularly through operational \npriorities  for tackling  climate  change,  building climate and  disaster resilience, and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability promoting rural development and food security.11  \n \nC.
