The ensuing project1 will contribute to the diversification of exports and the connection to \nregional markets for the Republic of Kazakhstan (Kazakhstan) and the Kyrgyz Republic. The \nensuing project is part of the development of the Almaty-Bishkek Economic Corridor (ABEC).2 The \nproject will support the modernization of wholesale markets to improve food safety, food security, \nand  increase  trade  with  key  markets.  Modern  wholesale  market  infrastructure  will  facilitate \ncertification for exports, traceability systems, and most importantly, transparent market access and \nstorage of fresh produce. As a result, incentives to expand agricultural production regarding quality, \nquantity, and seasonality will benefit small- and medium-sized producers in the region. \n \n2.  The ensuing project will be aligned with the following impacts: the share of agriculture in \ngross domestic product in Kazakhstan must increase five-fold by 2050,3 and raising the well-\nbeing in the Kyrgyz Republic by improving connectivity with regional markets and developing \nthe agriculture sector.4 The project will have three outputs: (i) wholesale market storage and \nlogistics facilities constructed, (ii) export certification for the Eurasian Economic Union and \nother major markets established, and (iii) effective ownership and management of collection \ncenters established. The outputs will result in the following outcome: share of safe and certified \nhorticultural exports increased.  The project is estimated to cost $200 million ($150 million for \nKazakhstan and $60 million for the Kyrgyz Republic). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nfinance $50 million for the Kyrgyz Republic from its ordinary capital resources ($25 million in \nconcessional loans and $25 million in grants), and $75 million of nonsovereign financing for \nKazakhstan from its ordinary capital resources. The governments of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, $10 million each through land provision, and for the Kyrgyz Republic exemptions of \ntaxes and duties for imported goods, works, and services. For Kazakhstan, $55 million is intended \nto be provided through sponsor cofinancing.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the governments of the Republic of \nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic (the governments) prepare the project.

The Kazakh part of the project is envisaged as nonsovereign transaction and is therefore not included \nin the country operations business plan for Kazakhstan. Both countries agreed to pursue this project by protocol of \nthe bilateral ABEC Subcommittee meeting, which was held on 25 September 2017 in Bishkek and reconfirmed by \nthe second ABEC Subcommittee meeting on 11 June 2018 in Almaty. \n2  The ABEC comprises Almaty City, Almaty Oblast (province), and Zhambyl Oblast in Kazakhstan as well as Bishkek \nCity, Chui Oblast, and Issyk-Kul Oblast in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Cost and Financing \n \n5.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,050,000, of which $1 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by TASF-other sources and $1 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Regional \nCooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership Facility.5 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.
