The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  improve  the  planning  and \nmanagement system of vocational training and subsidies in Chongqing Municipality through the \ndevelopment of a unified information management platform for vocational training which will be \nintegrated with the existing labor and social security information systems. Following a fact-\nfinding mission in December 2013, ADB and the government reached an understanding on the \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for consultants. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 The TA is included in the PRC\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2013\u20132015.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC assigns high priority to vocational training as a principal measure to (i) improve \nworkforce skills; (ii) promote equal opportunity for quality employment; (iii) enhance innovation \ncapacity and competitiveness of enterprises; and (iv) accelerate structural shifts in the economy, \nand the process of industrialization and urbanization. The government has been playing an \nactive role in improving the vocational training system to respond to diversified needs. To \nencourage all of the working-age population to receive vocational training, the government \nprovides subsidies for vocational training institutions and trainees. These subsidies have been \ncombined  with  measures  to  improve  quality  and  effectiveness  of  the  training,  such  as \nstrengthening quality assurance mechanisms for vocational training institutions, occupational \nskills  assessment  and certification  systems,  and  public  employment services.  Allocation of \nvocational training subsidies has been linked to the results of the quality assessment of training \ninstitutions, and skills certification or employment of trainees.  \n \n3.  To enhance equity, effectiveness, and efficiency of vocational training and subsidies \nprovided for it, the government requires provincial and municipal governments to establish a \nunified information management platform for vocational training that is integrated with labor and \nsocial security information systems within the framework of the national Golden Social Security \nProject.3 The  unified  information  management  platform  for  vocational  training  would  be \ndesigned to improve transparency and efficiency of allocation and use of vocational training \nsubsidies by allowing the dynamic management of vocational training institutions and training \ncourses, real-name management of trainees to prevent multiple allocation of subsidies to the \nsame trainees,4 and improved planning of vocational training responding to the needs of the \nlocal economy and enterprises.  \n \n4.  The Chongqing Municipal Government (CMG) has taken the lead in implementing the \nGolden Social Security Project. Chongqing, with a population of more than 33 million, is located \nin the southwestern region and is one of four provincial level municipalities that report directly to \nthe central government. Chongqing has experienced substantial growth since the 1980s, with its \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 May 2014.  \n2  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n3  An e-government initiative to improve access to labor and social security services through information and \ncommunication technology networks of central, provincial, and municipal governments.  \n4  Registration of each trainee by name and identification number for a particular vocational training course prevents \nthe same trainee from receiving vocational training subsidies multiple times (a trainee is entitled to receive \nvocational training subsidies only once a year) and helps track each trainee from enrollment to course completion, \nand from course completion to skills certification or employment. The existing occupational skills assessment and \ncertification system uses a real-name management system. \n ", "2   \neconomic  performance  surpassing  the  national  average.  Along  with  economic  growth, \nChongqing\u2019s economy has been undergoing structural change, shifting outputs and employment \naway  from  agriculture  to  manufacturing  and  services.  As  part  of  the  structural  change  of \nemployment, about 8.8 million workers moved away from farms in 2011 to find employment, \nresulting in a corps of 13.7 million migrant workers in 2011. In addition, 0.14 million university \nand college graduates entered the labor market; this number has been increasing annually. \nAlthough the unemployment rate has remained low at 3.5%\uf02d3.9% between 2008 and 2011, the \nquality and stability of employment are serious concerns.  \n \n5.  The  CMG\u2019s  vocational  training  subsidies  are  targeted  at  the  unemployed,  migrant \nworkers, university and college graduates, and junior and senior secondary graduates who have \nnot attended higher education. The municipal bureau of human resources and social security \n(BHRSS) supervises 56 public technical schools, in addition to a number of private vocational \ntraining  institutions,  and  113  public  employment  and  human  resource  service  centers  in \nChongqing. The number of people who benefited from vocational training offered by public \ntechnical schools increased from 0.17 million in 2011 to 0.19 million in 2012. Similarly, the \nbeneficiaries of vocational training provided by private institutions augmented from 0.85 million \nto 1.13 million in that period.  \n \n6.  Currently,  the  procedures  for  application,  approval,  transfer,  and  management  of \nvocational  training  subsidies  vary  across  districts  and counties. The  allocation  and  use of \nvocational training subsidies have not been transparent and efficient. For example, there is no \nmeans  to  verify  and  ensure  whether  (i) vocational  training  subsidies  reach  the  targeted \npopulation, (ii) vocational training institutions benefiting from subsidies meet the quality and \nperformance  standards,  and  (iii) vocational  training  offered  by  institutions  addresses  skill \ndemands  of  enterprises  and  the  local  economy.  On  the  other  hand,  citizens  (including \nemployers  and  those  targeted  by  vocational  training  subsidies)  have  limited  access  to \ninformation and services related to vocational training, employment, and their entitlement. For \nexample,  information  on  vocational  training  institutions  and  courses,  the  quality  and \nperformance of the institutions and the courses, benefits of vocational training (such as higher \nrates of employment, shorter time to get employment), and expected average wages are not \nreadily available; or the procedures for registering, making payment, and enrolling for vocational \ntraining courses are cumbersome.  \n \n7.  Within the framework of the Golden Social Security Project, the CMG plans to develop a \nunified information management platform for vocational training designed to enhance the equity, \nefficiency,  and  effectiveness  of  vocational  training  and  subsidies.  In  2012,  it  successfully \ncompleted phase I of the project with the establishment of a social security card system. Under \nphase II, the CMG intends to link the social security card system to labor and social security \nservices. The TA is to (i) support the development of a unified information management platform \nfor  vocational  training  to  be  integrated  with  the  existing  social  security  card  system,5 \noccupational skills assessment and certification system,6 and an online job placement system;7  \nand (ii) disseminate information and knowledge on the unified information management platform \nto citizens and other provinces and municipalities.  \n \n                                                \n5  Chongqing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Public Information. \nhttp://www.cqldbz.gov.cn:9001/ggfw/index.jsp \n6  Chongqing Occupational Skill Testing Authority. http://www.cqosta.org.cn/ \n7  Chongqing\u2019s Employment. http://cqjy.cqhrss.gov.cn/cqjy/index.html \n ", "  3 \n8.  The  TA  will  support  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  improving  livelihoods  by  developing \nemployment-oriented  skills  and  promoting  equal  opportunities  for  quality  employment  by \nenhancing equity, efficiency, and effectiveness of vocational training and related subsidies. The \nTA is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\uf02d2015 for the PRC8 and the pillar \nof inclusive growth, as it supports expanding livelihood opportunities for the poor. The TA will \nstrengthen the knowledge base for ongoing and upcoming technical and vocational education \nand training projects, and related components of urban development projects (if any), by sharing \ngood practices of vocational training planning, management and financing, quality assurance, \nskills assessment and certification, and links to labor and social security services.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be enhanced equity, effectiveness, and efficiency of vocational training \nand subsidies provided in Chongqing. This will be measured by (i) the percentage of those who \nreceive vocational training among the unemployed, migrant workers, university and college \ngraduates, and junior and senior secondary graduates who have not attended higher education \nincreases from 6% in 2012 to 10% in 2018; and (ii) the percentage of trainees who obtain \noccupational skills certificates increases from 82% in 2012 to 88% in 2018. The outcome will be \nan improved planning and management system of vocational training and subsidies for it.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  have  two  outputs:  (i)  a  unified  information  management  platform  for \nvocational training developed, and (ii) information and knowledge on the unified information \nmanagement platform for vocational training disseminated.  \n \n11.  Output  1:  Unified  information  management  platform  for  vocational  training \ndeveloped. The TA will develop a unified information management platform for vocational \ntraining to be used by the municipal, district, and county BHRSSs, occupational skill testing \nauthorities, vocational training institutions, and citizens. The platform will (i) standardize quality \nassurance mechanisms for vocational training institutions, and training courses and procedures \nfor  application,  approval,  transfer,  and  management  of  subsidies  for  vocational  training \ninstitutions and trainees across districts and counties; (ii) allow online registration, change, and \ncancellation for training courses and skills assessment and certification, online payment, and \nonline  training;  (iii)  host  databases  of  vocational  training  institutions,  trainees,  employers, \noccupational classification, and financial transactions involved in vocational training subsidies; \n(iv) enable user management and authentication; and (v) provide access to information on \nvocational training institutions and courses, the quality and performance of the institutions and \nthe courses, and labor market and vocational training analysis and forecast. \n \n12.  Output 1 will be developed in two phases. Phase 1 activities will be carried out during  \n4 months: (i) assess existing labor and social security information systems; (ii) review quality \nassurance  mechanisms  for  vocational  training  institutions  and  training  courses;  (iii)  review  \nprocedures for application, approval, transfer, and management of subsidies for vocational \ntraining institutions and trainees; (iv) collect and analyze available data on the labor market,9 \nand vocational training and development of methodology, tools, and data to be integrated with \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n9  The existing online job placement system could be one source of data on the labor market (footnote 7).  \n ", "4   \nthe unified information management platform to conduct labor market and vocational training \nanalysis and forecast; (v) visit countries with advanced labor and social security information \nsystems; and (vi) conduct a preliminary study and design a unified information management \nplatform that incorporates results of the first five activities. Phase 2 activities will (i) develop and \ntest a unified information management platform and a user\u2019s manual (within 10 months); and  \n(ii) train the municipal, district, and county BHRSSs, occupational skill testing authorities, and \nvocational  training  institutions  on  the  use  and  operation  of  the  information  management \nplatform. \n \n13.  Output  2: Information  and  knowledge  on  the  unified  information  management \nplatform  for  vocational  training  disseminated. The TA will support the dissemination of \ninformation  and  knowledge  on  the  unified  information  management  platform  for  vocational \ntraining  to  citizens,  and  other  provinces  and  municipalities.  Activities  include  (i)  develop \ninformation materials on the unified information management platform for vocational training for \ncitizens with consideration for the four categories of people targeted by the vocational training \nsubsidies;  and  (ii) conduct  a  knowledge-sharing  workshop  on  the  information  management \nplatform, and the role of information and communication technology in developing integrated \nlabor and social security systems. \n \n14.  The two outputs are based on the assumption that district and county BHRSSs are \ncommitted  to  using  the  information  management  platform.  Other  key  assumptions  are \nChongqing  Municipal  BHRSS  continues  to  be  strongly  committed  to  the  information \nmanagement platform and improvement of quality assurance mechanisms and procedures for \nvocational training subsidies, and willing to share information and experience. The key risks are \npolicy changes with regard to vocational training subsidies; political risks, including leadership \naffecting project implementation; constraints on municipal, district, and county BHRSSs in terms \nof resources and other emerging priorities; and technical problems regarding data sharing and \ntransfer.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $480,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, servers, software \nlicenses, maintenance, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan is \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Finance (CMBF) will be the executing agency, \noverseeing coordination of different bureaus and divisions involved in vocational training and \nrelated  services.  The  Chongqing  Municipal  BHRSS  will  be  the  implementing  agency  and \nassume overall responsibility for TA activities in cooperation with other bureaus and divisions. A \nproject steering committee, chaired by the deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal BHRSS \nand comprising representatives from the CMBF, Chongqing Municipal BHRSS, and Human \nResources  and  Social  Security  Information  Center,  will  be  established  to  provide  overall \nguidance and support for TA implementation. The Chongqing Municipal BHRSS and Human \nResource  and  Social  Security  Information  Center  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  the \ninformation  management  platform  for  vocational  training  under  the  Golden  Social  Security \nProject. The TA will be implemented from 15 June 2014 to 15 December 2015. \n \n ", "  5 \n17.  Procurement, if any, will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time). Goods procured will be turned over to the CMBF upon completion \nof the TA. An advance payment facility will be established at the CMBF for the expense of \ntraining and workshops, international study visits, and miscellaneous administrative and support \ncosts. All international study visits will be to ADB member countries. Proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n18.  The TA will engage a consulting firm (national, 46.0 person-months) to provide one \nfunctional lead and seven information and communication technology specialists to develop the \ninformation management platform. The consulting firm will be selected using quality- and cost-\nbased selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. A national firm can be justified on the grounds \nthat the estimated contract amount is small and unattractive to international firms, and national \nfirms are available in the market for similar information system development. In addition, two \ninternational consultants for a total of 3.0 person-months and three national consultants for a \ntotal of 9.5 person-months will be engaged on an individual basis to provide expertise in labor \nand  social  security  policies  and  systems,  vocational  training  fund  management,  vocational \ntraining quality assurance, and labor forecasting. This will be done in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget. The main mechanism \nto monitor and assess the TA will be TA review missions. To support monitoring and evaluation, \nthe consultants will submit an inception report, a midterm report, a draft final report, and a final \nreport in English and Chinese to the CMBF, the implementing agency, and ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Chongqing  Vocational  Training \nInformation Management Platform Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced  Percentage of those who  Implementing  Government continues to \nequity,  receive vocational  agency\u2019s report and  provide the same level of \neffectiveness,  training among the  statistics available on  subsidies for vocational training, \nand efficiency of  unemployed, migrant  the information  especially for the unemployed, \nvocational  workers, university and  management platform  migrant workers, university and \ntraining and  college graduates, and    college graduates, and junior \nsubsidies  junior and senior    and senior secondary graduates  \nprovided in  secondary graduates who     \nChongqing  have not attended higher    No radical changes are made in \neducation increased from    the occupational skills \n \n6% in 2012 to 10% in    assessment and certification \n2018    system  \n     \nPercentage of trainees  Implementing  Risk \nwho obtain occupational  agency\u2019s report and  Political and economic factors \nskills certificates  statistics available on  impact the government\u2019s ability \nincreased from 82% in  the information  to maintain adequate support \n2012 to 88% in 2018  management platform  for vocational training  \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved  A unified information  Implementing  District and county BHRSSs are \nplanning and  management platform for  agency\u2019s report and  committed to using the \nmanagement  vocational training is  statistics available on  information management \nsystem of  available to all municipal,  the information  platform  \nvocational  district, and county  management platform   \ntraining and  bureaus of human  Risk \nsubsidies  resources and social  Policy changes impact \nprovided for it  security (BHRSSs);  vocational training subsidies \noccupational skill testing \nauthorities; and \nvocational training \ninstitutions in the \nChongqing municipality \nby 2016 \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
