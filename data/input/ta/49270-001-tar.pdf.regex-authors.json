INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Carbon Market Program  (CMP), established in 2006,1 is one of the flagship climate \nchange initiatives of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing technical support and carbon \nfinance  to  mitigation  projects  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  The  CMP \nincludes (i) the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund; (ii) the Future Carbon Fund; and (iii) the Technical \nSupport Facility. The Technical Support Facility has been the main instrument through which \nADB provides capacity building support to its DMCs for enhancing mitigation actions through \ncarbon markets.  \n \n2.  The proposed regional capacity development TA will enable ADB to continue supporting \nDMCs in maximizing market-based opportunities to transit towards low\u2013carbon economies. The \nconcept  paper  for  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  was  approved  by  the  vice-president  of \nKnowledge Management and Sustainable Development on 19 October 2015. The TA will build \non ADB\u2019s strong expertise and experience from three previous TA projects under the CMP and \nproactively respond to DMCs\u2019 needs for support in order to take up the opportunities presented \nby the emerging international climate change architecture.2 \n \n3.  The  TA  has  been  developed  in  consultation  with  the  governments  of  Finland  and \nLuxembourg, including consideration of Finland\u2019s Development Policy Programme and criteria \nspecified  by  their  quality  assurance  board.  The  TA  was  also  conceptualized  following \nconsultations with DMCs.3 Further consultation with DMCs will be undertaken while developing \nthe detailed TA work plan. \n \n4.  The TA is closely linked to ADB\u2019s strategic framework\u2014Strategy 2020\u2014and its midterm \nreview,4 which includes environment and climate change as one of the priorities that ADB will \nstrategically focus on leading up to 2020.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Robust economic growth has led to significant rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \nin the Asia and Pacific region, with Asia\u2019s share of global GHG emissions projected to increase \nfrom 42.8% in 2010 to 51.2% by 2035.6 The region is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of \nclimate change, presenting new challenges for development efforts. For fulfilling ADB\u2019s vision of \n\u201can Asia Pacific free of poverty\u201d and its mission to reduce poverty, improve living conditions, and \nquality of life will be impossible without sustained efforts to mitigate climate change. \n \n6.  Enormous amount of investment is required to help developing countries transit to a low-\ncarbon path. According to the International Energy Agency, the mitigation costs for developing \n                                                \n1  Then called the Carbon Market Initiative. \n2 ADB.  2006.

Manila.    \n3  This includes (i) Thailand\u2019s interest in capacity building support for developing its domestic emission trading \nscheme (ETS), and (ii) informal consultations with the designated national authorities of 10 DMCs held in Manila on \n30 September 2015.  \n4  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "2 \n \ncountries are expected to be $140 billion\u2013$175 billion per year by 2030. In 2010, developed \ncountries committed to mobilize climate finance of $100 billion a year for developing countries \nby 2020. The Climate Policy Initiative estimates that of the $331 billion of climate finance in \n2013, about $34 billion flowed from developed to developing countries, leaving a gap of about \n$70 billion.  \n \n7.  It is critical that all possible channels of financing including policy instruments such as \ncarbon market mechanisms are utilized to close the gap. Given that market mechanisms such \nas  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  have  been  successful  in  mobilizing  carbon \nfinance  to  support  mitigation  actions,  there  is  a  significant  support  for  the  use  of  market \nmechanisms. As carbon markets in the region evolve beyond CDM, there is a need to maintain \nand further build institutional capacities to ensure their growth and enhanced effectivity.  \n \n8.  At the 20th Conference of the Parties in December 2014, the parties agreed to provide \ntheir  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  which  represent  initial  pledges  on  what \ncountries will do to reduce GHG emissions under a future international agreement.7 These will \nform the basis for talks at the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris in December 2015 and will \nbe the critical foundation upon which future carbon markets can be built. To date, 127 countries \nhave  made  pledge  submissions  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate \nChange, with more than 86% of global GHG emissions covered. The need to mobilize additional \nclimate finance is even more pressing now that the developing countries are expected to meet \ntheir GHG emission reduction targets as communicated in their Intended Nationally Determined \nContributions.   \n \n9.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  market  mechanisms,  several  DMCs  are  considering \ndesigning and implementing domestic emission trading schemes (ETSs) to meet their GHG \nemission reduction ambitions. The People\u2019s Republic of China has launched carbon markets in \nfive cities and two provinces, as pilot schemes for a national ETS from 2017.8 Other countries \nincluding Thailand and Viet Nam have expressed interest in developing their domestic ETSs. \nHarmonizing and interlinking such emerging ETSs will be required to facilitate market liquidity \nand enhance the economic efficiency of carbon markets in Asia and the Pacific. \n \n10.  The lengthy and complex global climate negotiations and the combination of existing and \nemerging carbon markets and mechanisms are making matters increasingly intricate for DMCs. \nDeveloping  new  markets  and  mechanisms  is  a  complex  task  and  requires  significant \npreparation  and  strong  building  blocks.  Multilateral  development  institutions  such  as  ADB \ntherefore need to play a bridging and enabling leadership role to support DMCs in building \ninstitutional  expertise,  optimizing  market  opportunities,  and  maintaining  momentum  for  low \ncarbon development in the region.  \n \n11.  Successful development and implementation of carbon market mechanisms are likely to \nspur economic activities in Asia and the Pacific, leading to opportunities for ADB in areas such \nas renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low-carbon transport. New carbon markets will also \nhelp ADB meet its operational targets by generating demand for projects using climate-friendly \n                                                \n7  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. \nhttp://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx  \n8  The  seven  pilots\u2014in  Beijing,  Tianjin,  Shanghai,  Chongqing,  Shenzhen,  Hubei  province,  and  Guangdong \nprovince\u2014were put into operation in 2013\u20132014. While these pilot schemes are similar, there are differences in \ndesign between them. Since the first transaction was carried out in Shenzhen, the pilot systems have achieved a \ncumulative transaction volume of 11.8 million tons with a trading value of CNY450 million.  \n ", "3 \n \ntechnologies and enhancing internal rates of return for such investments. The development of \nnew markets and mechanisms is expected to provide incentives for the transfer of low-carbon \ntechnologies and technical expertise to DMCs. This will also present opportunities for ADB to \ncooperate with its international development partners in providing carbon finance and other \ncofinancing support, enabling knowledge support for green growth in Asia and the Pacific.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be participating DMCs in Asia and the Pacific effectively \ntransition  to  low-carbon  growth. 9 The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  that  the  knowledge, \nunderstanding, and use of existing and new carbon markets and mechanisms by DMCs will be \nenhanced. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA aims to help DMCs pursue their national GHG emission reduction ambitions \nthrough effective participation in carbon markets. The TA will provide capacity building support \nto  participating  DMCs  through  enhanced  access  to  information,  knowledge  sharing,  and \ntechnical support. The capacity building activities will include trainings, workshops, conferences, \nseminars,  and  direct  consultation  support  to  DMC  governments,  institutions,  and  project \ndevelopers.10 The TA will rely on individual consultants working with and advising stakeholders.  \n \n14.  The TA requires flexibility in terms of the DMCs that are supported for individual outputs \nand  the  specific  capacity  building  activities  each  of  the  DMCs  will  require  in  order  to \nappropriately  respond  to  the  evolving  international  climate  change  architecture  and  take \nadvantage of existing as well as emerging markets and mechanisms. The TA will respond to the \nneeds of DMCs by (i) supporting the development of domestic ETSs and facilitating linkages \namong ETSs where possible; (ii) building the capacities of DMCs to participate in new market \nmechanisms while providing continued support to existing carbon markets and maximizing the \ntransfer of knowledge and skills to the new mechanisms; (iii) facilitating climate change action \nby nonstate actors such as cities, regions, private companies, and investors; and (iv) supporting \ncooperation among DMCs for learning from each other\u2019s experiences. The TA has the following \nthree outputs:  \n \n15.  Output  1:  Development  and  implementation  of  domestic  emissions  trading \nschemes and their linkages facilitated. The TA will provide capacity building support to DMCs \ninterested in developing their domestic ETS and/or linking their domestic ETS to other national \nor regional ETSs in the future. The TA will facilitate knowledge sharing among various DMCs on \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n10 The proposed activities under the TA will have long-lasting benefits and will continue to assist DMCs after the TA \nhas been completed. Support provided in the design and implementation of domestic ETSs will continue to provide \nincentives for greenhouse gas mitigation activities beyond the length of the TA, and also facilitate possible \ninterlinking for the development of a much larger market in the future. New markets and mechanisms facilitated \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nunder the TA will continue to support the respective DMCs in achieving their policy ambitions for achieving \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nemission reductions, and also mobilize new carbon finance. Similarly, improving the capacity of stakeholders to \nmanage their CDM projects will enhance the likelihood that these projects continue to perform and generate \ncertified emission reductions until the end of their crediting period and beyond. \n ", "4 \n \nthe design and implementation of domestic ETSs, including lessons from operational ETSs. To \nsupport development of domestic ETSs and potential links among ETSs in the future, outreach \nactivities such as focused consultations, capacity building workshops, and knowledge products \nwill be carried out. The countries to be supported will be identified through consultations.11  \n   \n16.  Output  2:  Development  of  initiatives  and  programs  in  developing  member \ncountries for new carbon markets and mechanisms enhanced. The TA will contribute to \nlow-carbon development in Asia and the Pacific through its support for the development of new \ncarbon  markets  and  mechanisms.  ADB  will  closely  coordinate  with  DMCs  to  identify  and \nrespond to their particular requirements, while guiding activities to maximize possibilities for \nDMCs under new carbon markets and mechanisms and respond to ongoing developments in \ninternational and domestic climate change architecture. ADB will provide capacity building, \nfocusing on assisting DMCs to maximize opportunities under new markets and mechanisms. \nThe TA will also support transfer of methodologies and tools developed under the CDM to other \nlow-carbon development initiatives. The potential applications may include those under the \nFramework  for  Various  Approaches12 under  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on \nClimate Change process, as well as other carbon market initiatives. The TA will also seek to \nleverage work under existing ADB projects and programs as appropriate.  \n \n17.  Output  3:  Stakeholder\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  clean  development  mechanism \nprojects and access to such tools in developing member countries enhanced. Support will \nfocus on both existing CDM projects and the transfer of knowledge and skills developed under \nthe  CDM  to  new  market  mechanisms.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  (i)  support  successful \nimplementation  of  CDM  projects  through  capacity  building  and  direct  project  support  for \nmeasuring,  reporting,  and  verifying,  and  issuing  certified  emission  reductions;  (ii)  support \ndevelopment of tools, 13 standardized baselines, and methods for enhancing the application of \nthe  CDM;  and  (iii)  undertake  capacity  building  workshops,  conferences,  and  seminars  on \neffective measuring, reporting, and verifying as well as other relevant carbon market issues. The \nTA will prioritize support for greenhouse gas mitigation activities hosted in least-developed \ncountries and other countries that have been underrepresented in carbon markets to date. \n  \n18.  The  major  risks  to  the  TA  are  identified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework \n(Appendix 1). To minimize these risks, under the TA (i) international climate negotiations and \nthe emerging international climate policy architecture will be closely monitored; (ii) a flexible \nproject design will be adopted to assist DMCs in enhancing their capacity to respond to new \nclimate architecture; and (iii) there will be participation in the design and development and \ntaking advantage of emerging new markets and mechanisms. Capacity building under the TA \nshould assist DMCs to make well-informed choices to overcome challenges presented by the \nprevailing  weak  carbon  markets  by  actively  participating  in  the  design,  development,  and \nexpansion of new emerging carbon markets.  \n                                                \n11  Thailand has expressed interest in capacity building support for developing a domestic ETS for which a possible \ndialogue  can  be  initiated  through  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations  Coordination  Division  of  the \nSoutheast Asia Regional Department for further engagement and enhancing awareness in this regard.  \n12  The Framework for Various Approaches is a set of components and rules that will ensure that all approaches \nused for mitigation meet certain standards, especially for environmental integrity. The framework will ensure that \nmitigation approaches are integrated and receive recognition for United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change compliance. \n13   CDM  tools  are  used  to  calculate,  determine,  demonstrate,  estimate,  identify,  and/or  test  information  on \ngreenhouse gas emission reduction projects. Examples include (i) a tool to calculate project or leakage carbon \ndioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and (ii) a tool to determine the baseline efficiency of thermal or \nelectric energy generation systems. \n ", "5 \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.   The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, of which $1,432,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Finland and $68,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Luxembourg, and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The Climate Change and Disaster Risk \nManagement Division, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC) will \nimplement the TA in coordination with regional departments to ensure that the TA complements \ncurrent and planned efforts of DMCs to support their national climate change actions. SDCC will \nalso  work  with  partner  organizations  in  supporting  DMCs  to  accomplish  their  capacity \ndevelopment objectives.14 The TA will be implemented over 24 months, beginning in January \n2016 until December 2017.15   \n \n21.  The TA will require about 36 person-months of international consulting services and 90 \nperson-months of national consulting services.  Consultants will be recruited individually, in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. SDCC will set up a \nteam  of  staff  to  regularly  manage  consultants,  administer  contracts  and  consolidate  their \noutputs.  \n \n22.  Purchase of equipment (i.e., computer hardware and software) will be undertaken by \nADB in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and \nin  coordination  with  the  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  Office  of \nAdministrative Services. After TA completion, any procured equipment will be disposed of in \ncompliance  with  the  project  administration  instructions  on  administering  grant-financed  TA. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Complementary inputs are \nexpected to be provided by host governments and organizations, including provision of support \nstaff at regional and national consultations and capacity building workshops. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,432,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Government of Finland, and (ii) ADB administering technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $68,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of \nLuxembourg for Supporting Low-Carbon Development in Asia and the Pacific through Carbon \nMarkets, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 The use of partnerships will be undertaken by ADB in accordance with Operations Manual section on cooperation \narrangements for development partnership (OM E3/ BP) and guided by the memorandum for heads of departments \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \non Clarification on Cooperation Arrangements for Development Partnerships, 7 August 2014. \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n15 As the TA is time-bound and has limited financial resources, ADB will ensure that the TA complements other \nstakeholders\u2019 capacity building activities in DMCs.
