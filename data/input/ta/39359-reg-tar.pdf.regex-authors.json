In September 2000, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly adopted the Millennium \nDeclaration defining Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which marked the international \ncommunity\u2019s  commitment  at  the  beginning  of  the  millennium  to  reduce  poverty  in  all  its \ndimensions  by  2015.  In  2004,  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Enhanced  Poverty \nReduction  Strategy  strongly  emphasized  MDG  achievement,  making  this  objective  ADB\u2019s  \nlong-term goal in the region, and the basis on which its overall development effectiveness is \nmeasured. Also in 2004, ADB entered into a regional partnership with the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) to support MDG achievement and approved the first phase of \na $1 million three-phase regional technical assistance (RETA) to support this partnership. The \nRETA  involves  preparation  of  joint  regional  reports  on  MDGs,  technical  papers,  capacity-\nbuilding  support  to  enhance  the  MDG  database,  and  advocacy  and  active  information \ndissemination  to  stakeholders  through  regional  MDG  forums.  The  RETA\u2019s  first  phase  of \n$350,000 was approved on 4 November 2004, and the second phase of $325,000 on 30 \nNovember 2005.  \n2.  The commitment and support of developing member countries (DMCs) in the region \n(including  ADB\u2019s  DMCs)  to  achieve  MDGs  was  stressed  during  an  August  2005  \nministerial-level meeting in Jakarta, which adopted a declaration by countries and stakeholders \nfor accelerating progress on MDGs.1 In March 2007, a regional road map\u2014jointly prepared by \nADB, UNESCAP, and UNDP as a response to the request of governments, donors, and other \nstakeholders at this meeting\u2014was adopted at the 63rd session of UNESCAP in Almaty. This \nroad map provides a platform for regional-level action in support of MDGs, involving various \nactions by developing countries, donors, and other stakeholders.  \n3.  So far, several important outputs have resulted from the partnership. A regional MDG \nreport, A Future Within Reach: Reshaping Institutions in a Region of Disparity to Meet the \nMillennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, was launched jointly by the three partner \ninstitutions at ADB headquarters and UN headquarters during the sidelines of the September \n2005  UN  General  Assembly  Session.  The  President  of  ADB  also  addressed  the  General \nAssembly on challenges facing MDG achievement in Asia and the Pacific. The partnership \namong the institutions has resulted in (i) publication of several technical papers apart from the \nregional report, on topics related to MDGs,2 and the launch of two annual MDG progress reports \nin October 2006 and October 2007;3 (ii) three high-level MDG consultations; (iii) advocacy and \ndissemination forums for South Asia, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia;4 and (iv) capacity-\nbuilding work on building up MDG data, including a workshop in Bangkok, 31 July\u20132 August \n2006, and an international conference on MDG statistics, 1\u20133 October 2007.   \n4.  The RETA\u2019s third phase5 will build on the outputs of the first and second phases, further \nadvancing regional efforts for MDG achievement. The technical assistance (TA) framework in \nAppendix 1 summarizes the third phase\u2019s main aspects. \n                                                 \n1  See the Jakarta Declaration at http://www.undp.or.id/archives/pressrelease/MDG_RMM_Jakarta_Declaration.pdf. \n2  Including (i) ADB, UNDP, UNESCAP, WHO. 2005.

ISSUES \n \n5.  2007 marks the midpoint between 2000, when the MDGs were adopted, and 2015, the \ntarget date of achievement\u2014however, many issues must still be addressed to ensure that \nDMCs reach their MDGs. Capacity and institutional constraints, as well as least developed \ncountries\u2019 (LDCs) financial gaps, must be urgently tackled. Data gaps have been also identified \nas  a  major  limitation  in  assessing  progress  accurately,  prohibiting  the  provision  of  policy \ndirection and intervention to fast-track MDG achievement in Asia and the Pacific.  \n6.  The most recent MDG progress report in Asia and the Pacific, from October 2007, \nhighlights progress in halving the number of people living on $1 a day as well as in some  \nnon-income  poverty  indicators.  The  region  is  progressing  well  on  many  additional  MDGs, \nincluding (i) reducing extreme poverty by half, (ii) attaining universal primary education, (iii) \nachieving gender parity in education, and (iv) reversing the incidence of tuberculosis. However, \nprogress is slow in some non-income poverty targets, including (i) reducing child malnutrition by \nhalf; (ii) decreasing child mortality by two thirds; (iii) reducing the share of rural population \nwithout access to drinking water by half; (iv) lowering the share of urban and rural population \nwithout  access  to  basic  sanitation  by  half;  (v)  halting  or  reversing  HIV/AIDS  and  other \ncommunicable diseases; (vi) reducing the loss of environmental resources; and (vii) lessening \ngender disparities in areas other than education, e.g., health, employment, income, ownership \nrights, and decision-making power in society.   \n7.  The data in this progress report indicates that for ADB DMCs, as many as 29 countries \nmay  not  reach  25%  or  more  of  the  19  non-income  MDG  indicators  studied.  Of  these  29 \ncountries, as many as 18 are Asian Development Fund-receiving countries\u2014indicating that \nparticular attention is needed towards the region\u2019s weaker countries. \n8.  The region still accounts for more than one-half of the world\u2019s poor, child and maternal \ndeaths, malnourished population, and numbers of people without access to improved sanitation \nand water supplies. The progress report estimates that if the currently off-track countries were to \nalter their course to a new trajectory that would enable them to meet the MDG targets by 2015, \nit would mean that (i) 196 million more people would be lifted out of poverty, (ii) 23 million less \nchildren would go hungry, (iii) about 1 million children would survive beyond their fifth birthday, \n(iv) 4 million more children would receive basic education, (v) 240 million more people would \nhave access to improved sanitation, and (vi) 80 million more urban dwellers would have access \nto improved water supplies.  \n9.  In addition, the report found that there is uneven progress among countries, as well as \nrising disparities between income groups and urban and rural areas\u2500with lowest-income groups \nand rural areas generally having substantially lower MDG achievement. There is also an urgent \nneed to prioritize LDCs, as they are generally off-track on MDGs pertaining to poverty, hunger, \nchild mortality, and access to water and sanitation, and they have the highest rates of child and \nmaternal mortality. \n10.  Continued work on these areas of concern is necessary. These issues must be studied, \nsolutions offered, and good practices that have worked elsewhere highlighted. The technical \npaper series that was begun with the second report will therefore need to be continued.   \n11.  Another significant issue is the weakness of MDG data, a constraint in making reliable \nprojections on many indicators for countries and on policy prescriptions for governments. While \nefforts were made prior to preparing the regional MDG report, as well as the progress reports of \n ", "  3\n2006 and 2007, many indicators are still unavailable, including those on maternal health and \nHIV and other communicable diseases. Coverage of data in Pacific countries and several \nCentral Asian countries is particularly weak.  \n12.  So far, outputs from the RETA\u2019s first and second phases have focused attention on \nissues facing MDG attainment as well as on galvanizing national and regional efforts to this \nobjective. However, considerable effort will be needed to sustain this momentum beyond 2007, \nso that all stakeholders continue to strive towards achieving them until 2015. This will require \ncontinuing dissemination activities on the findings of the next regional MDG report and technical \npapers on the areas of concern identified from earlier reports and feedback received at regional \nforums.  Active involvement of civil society and the private sector are necessary to achieve the \nMDGs and ways of involving and partnering with them better will have to be promoted. \n13.  Regional cooperation has remained a vital tool for reaching the MDG targets by 2015. \nTo this end, efforts to support regional cooperative efforts in Asia and the Pacific would also be \na priority in the RETA\u2019s third phase. The regional road map6 described in para. 2 aims to \noptimize  the  region-wide  efforts  of  ADB  and  the  partner  UN  institutions,  other  multilateral \ndevelopment banks, bilateral development agencies, intergovernmental bodies, and member \ncountries in support of MDGs. Focusing on off-track countries and those falling below the Asian \naverage, the road map presents five products and services that could be offered at the regional \nlevel: (i) knowledge and capacity development, (ii) expertise, (iii) resources, (iv) advocacy for \nMDGs, and (v) regional cooperation in delivering regional public goods. The RETA\u2019s third \nphase, this TA, will support this road map\u2019s implementation.  \n14.  ADB has been making considerable contributions towards supporting MDGs through its \noperations in its DMCs. As indicated in para. 1, ADB\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy \nstrongly emphasizes MDGs, as it supports income poverty reduction through infrastructure \ninvestments for growth and contributes to the environmental goal, particularly in clean energy \nand water and sanitation. ADB has also adapted a significant role in basic education and a \nmodest but critical one in HIV/AIDS control through regional efforts. It is also mainstreaming \ngender equality in operations. In addition, ADB\u2019s future project pipeline has significant support \nfor MDG-related sectors.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  In support of the milestones achieved and activities implemented under the RETA\u2019s first \nand second phases, the main goal of this TA is to establish a better basis for tracking MDG \nprogress  by  stakeholders  and  to  make  operationally  relevant  analysis  available  to  them, \nparticularly in the sectors of concern and countries of Asia and the Pacific that are currently at \nrisk of not achieving MDGs. It is envisaged that regional MDG reports, and background and \nsupporting technical papers, will be properly disseminated to raise awareness, lead to improved \npolicies and institutions, and generate increased resources and capacities for MDG attainment.  \n16.  The main outputs of this TA are (i) the joint regional MDG report III; (ii) background and \nsupporting  technical  papers;  (iii)  dissemination  of  these  reports  and  papers  to  appropriate \naudiences in DMCs so that greater awareness is created and necessary action is initiated by \n                                                 \n6  ADB, UNDP, UNESCAP. 2007.

This regional road map was supported by the 55 member countries of UNESCAP that \nincludes ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n ", "4   \ngovernments and all stakeholders for MDG achievement; and (iv) activities to further improve \ndata  on  MDGs,  particularly  improved  data  coverage  that  highlights  countries  at  risk  and \nidentifies financing gaps. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  ADB, UNDP, and UNESCAP will closely monitor the TA\u2019s outputs and outcomes. It is \nenvisaged that it will tentatively cover the following areas:  \n(i)  Knowledge  products  on  MDGs.  The  TA\u2019s  major  emphasis  will  be  on  the \npreparation of the MDG III report, expected to be finalized within the first quarter \nof  2008;  technical  background  papers;  and  annual  progress  reports.  The \ntechnical background papers are tentatively proposed to focus on the following \nareas,  which  will  be  confirmed  based  on  needs  assessed  during  TA \nimplementation:  (a)  country  needs  assessments  and  identification  of  MDG \nresource/financing gaps in LDCs;7 (b) new directions in reducing poverty and \nhunger;  (c)  transboundary  issues  on  the  environment  and  MDGs;  (d)  new \noptions/innovative approaches in addressing women and child health issues; (e) \nimproving synergies between social and physical infrastructure for achieving the \nMDGs; and (f) expanding cooperation between LDCs and high- and middle-\nincome countries of Asia for MDGs. \n(ii)  Improving data coverage and quality. This TA will continue the efforts begun \nunder the RETA\u2019s second phase and will focus primarily on capacity building to \nimprove data on MDGs with the aim of covering existing data gaps within a few \nyears.  Large  data  gaps  exist  in  most  international  data  series,  especially  in \nextreme  poverty,  child  hunger,  maternal  health,  educational  attainment,  and \nyouth unemployment. This would require close coordination of activities between \nthe three partner institutions, the ADB Institute, and other national and regional \nagencies  that  will  be  involved  in  capacity-building  activities  focused  on \naddressing the lack of national statistical capacity. Appendix 4 contains details of \nthe capacity-building concept note from which a more detailed action plan will be \ndeveloped during TA implementation.  \n(iii)  Dissemination. So that issues highlighted in the MDG regional reports and the \ntechnical  paper  series  will  continue  to  be  deliberated  by  policy  makers,  aid \nsources, and other stakeholders, a dissemination program involving subregional \nlaunches of the MDG report III and technical papers, national advocacy and \ncommunication events, workshops, and web-based information and networking \nwill be implemented. This will require preparation of dissemination material for \nvarious types of media, and involve the help of ADB resident missions and UNDP \ncountry  offices.  The  establishment  of  a  network  of  research  and  academic \ninstitutions to exchange MDG research, results, and information will be explored. \nWhen possible, reports will be translated into various languages to reach a wider \naudience and for greater utilization.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA has a total cost of $1,300,000, of which $325,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program and the balance by the two partners UNESCAP and UNDP. \n                                                 \n7  UNDP has begun conducting gap assessment exercises in several countries.  \n ", "  5\nOf  this  amount,  $200,000  will  be  transferred  to  UNESCAP  for  its  portion  of  the  TA \nimplementation that is broadly defined in para. 15; while $125,000 will be retained by ADB for \nADB-led activities. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The  three-phase  RETA  is  an  important  collaboration  between  ADB,  UNDP,  and \nUNESCAP, which have all given financial and staff resource commitments to ensure quality \noutputs. A formal memorandum of understanding was signed with UNESCAP and UNDP for the \nfirst  phase,  defining  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  partner  institutions  to  ensure  the \nproject\u2019s smooth implementation. This arrangement was continued for the second phase and \nwill be employed for this TA.8 ADB will be the Executing Agency, to be implemented by the \nPoverty Unit of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, which will coordinate \nan interdepartmental effort for the purpose. The TA will be implemented for a period of 30 \nmonths from December 2007 to June 2010. \n20.  A  high-level  steering  committee  comprising  the  ADB  vice  president  for  knowledge \nmanagement  and  sustainable  development,  UNESCAP  executive  secretary,  and  UNDP \nassistant administrator for East Asia and the Pacific was established to provide overall project \nguidance.  A  working  group  consisting  of  representatives  from  the  three  organizations  will \ncoordinate the preparation and ensure the quality and timely delivery of outputs, as before.  \n \n21.  This third phase will engage 9 person-months of consulting services (4 person-months \ninternational, and 5 person-months national) for the TA activities directly undertaken by ADB. \nThe consultants to be hired by ADB will be development specialists with experience in the area \nof MDGs (Appendix 3). The consultants will be selected and engaged individually in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $325,000 on a grant basis for \nsupporting  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  in  the  Asia and  Pacific \nRegion, Phase III, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8  The memoranda of understanding necessary include brief documents highlighting only the third phase\u2019s specific \naspects and confirming the main agreements of the previous phases. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nGreater awareness of  Increased support for  Individual MDG country  \u2022  Countries strongly support \nMDGs in DMCs that can  MDGs in national plans  reports  MDG philosophy as reflected \nlead to improved policies  and strategies by 2010    in their development \nand increased resources  National poverty reduction  documents, policies, and \nfor MDG attainment  strategy documents  budgets. \n   \nRegional MDG reports and  Risk \nupdates   \n\u2022  Economic shocks prevent \nsufficient prioritization for \nMDGs. \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nImproved basis for  Periodic availability of  MDG indicators based on UN  \u2022  Continued commitment of \ntracking progress of  MDG progress monitoring  data   governments and other \nMDGs by stakeholders  reports, e.g., at least once  stakeholders in achieving \nestablished  a year  MDGs \n     \nOperationally relevant  Increase in operationally  \u2022  Successful partnerships with \nanalysis made available  relevant analytical studies  national and regional \n  that are produced and  statistical agencies are \n  disseminated  established. \n   \n  Improvement in MDG \nBetter quality data on  indicators in database \nMDGs produced by DMCs  figures for countries in \nAsia and the Pacific by \n2010, particularly in \ncountries identified as at \nrisk in the 2007 MDG \nprogress report  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

The  MDG  expert  will  have  professional  experience  in  development,  including  field \nexperience in poverty reduction and MDGs; possess considerable experience in working on \nMDG-related  issues;  and  have  contributed  to  international  journals  on  these  areas.  The \nactivities of this position include but are not limited to:  \n(i)  supporting  the  work  of  the  international  consultant  in  all  assigned  tasks, \nparticularly with respect to data gathering and analysis;  \n(ii)  assisting the international consultant in the preparation of technical papers that \nanalyze  specific  issues  concerning  MDG  achievement,  and  provide  expert \nopinions and advice for governments\u2019 use; \n(iii)  supporting the international consultant in reviewing concept notes and technical \npapers prepared by other agencies and providing comments to improve the \nquality of the final documents; \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(iv)  organizing workshops and seminars undertaken as part of the dissemination \nactivities for the MDG report III, annual progress reports, and other technical \npapers, and preparing dissemination material; and \n(v)  supporting  web-based  dissemination  on  the  ADB  poverty  web  site.\n ", "  Appendix 4  11 \nIMPROVING DATA FOR MONITORING MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS \nIN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC \n \n1.  Despite  recent  progress,  the  need  for  complete  and  consistent  data  for  monitoring \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains urgent. The newly released MDG progress \nupdate, The Millennium Development Goals: Progress in Asia and the Pacific 2007, reveals \nlarge data gaps in most international data series, particularly in extreme poverty, child hunger, \nmaternal health, educational attainment, and youth unemployment. \n \n2.  These  data  gaps  reflect  the  lack  of  country  capacity  to  produce  basic  human \ndevelopment  statistics on  a  sustainable  basis,  as  well  as  to  use  existing,  alternative  data \nsources  to  produce  indirect  estimates  for  some  key  MDG  indicators.  In  addition,  poor \ncoordination among statistical agencies within countries and between national and international \nagencies often leads to inconsistent national and international data series, which undermines \nthe credibility of national or regional progress assessments and affects policy dialogues.   \n \n3.  To improve the reliability and availability of data for monitoring MDGs in Asia and the \nPacific, the partnership between the Asian Development Bank, United Nations Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), and United Nations Development Programme proposes to \nconduct an assessment of countries\u2019 statistical capacity to produce timely data for core MDG \nindicators with large existing data gaps. This assessment, coordinated by UNESCAP, will be \nconducted through an information survey among countries with topics including: (i) the current \ndata  source,  e.g.,  census,  survey,  or  administrative  system;  (ii)  responsible  national  data \nagencies; (iii) sustainability of data production, e.g., periodicity of surveys; (iv) data quality \nissues, e.g., coverage and other limitations of administrative data; and (v) possible alternative \ndata  sources  and  the  needs  for  developing  estimation/imputation  methodologies.  The \nassessment\u2019s results will provide a basis for developing targeted capacity-building activities, \nincluding training and technical support. When creating the assessment, countries\u2019 differing \nneeds will be taken into account. The focus will be on the weaker, but several middle-income \ncountries also have data gaps and require special measures to address them. An inventory of \nexisting data sources, including survey data, will also be a part of the assessment. \n \n4.  The above partnership also proposes to promote coordination among national statistical \nagencies to strengthen the role of national statistic offices as central coordinators, and between \nnational  and  international  data  agencies  to  improve  international  data  availability  and  the \nconsistency between national and international data series. The significant role of regional \nagencies in strengthening capacities will also be taken into account by expanding the tripartite \npartnership to include United Nations Statistics Division and the regional arms of other key \ninternational data agencies. The information survey on country capacity and the subsequent \ndevelopment of technical support activities to countries will be carried out under this expanded \npartnership and will enhance country coordination. With the support of the United Nations \nStatistics Division and UNESCAP, the United Nations country team\u2014which in many countries is \nheaded by UNDP given its critical role in country MDG reporting and in the Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Papers (PRSP) and National Human Development Report (NHDR) processes\u2014should \nbe promoted as an in-country mechanism that supports better coordination of more consistent \nMDG data for both national and international assessments. The specific coordination measures \nto  be  developed  under  this  project  will  support  existing  data  collection  and  dissemination \nmechanisms established by international data agencies.  \n \n5.  This proposed project is a response to country needs expressed at the 2006 Workshop \non  Statistics  for  Monitoring  the  Achievement  of  the  MDGs  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  which \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \noccurred in Bangkok, 31 July\u20132 August 2007, and the 2007 International Conference on the \nMDGs, which took place in Manila, 1\u20133 October 2007. It will inevitably be linked to other \nongoing statistical capacity building activities of the key agencies, e.g., the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s project on improving administrative data sources1 and Statistical Institute for Asia and \nthe Pacific\u2019s training program. The results of the information survey will also provide a basis for \ndeveloping future complementary statistical capacity-building activities in the region.  \n \n6.  Based on this concept note, a more detailed action plan will be developed over the first 3 \nmonths of technical assistance implementation. The proposed activities will be implemented, \nbased on funds allocated for the technical assistance, and made available by other partners.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.
