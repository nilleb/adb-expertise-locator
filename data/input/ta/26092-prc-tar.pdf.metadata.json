The  Government  of  People's  Republic  of  China  requested  Bank\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  develop  a  national  response  strategy  for\nchanges  in  the  global  climate.  The  need  tor  the  TA was  discussed  with  a\nBank  Environment  Sector-cum-Consultation  Mi.sion  fielded  concurrently  with\nthe  country  Programming  Mission  in  April  1991.  In  response  to  the\nGovernment's  request,  a Fact-finding  Mi8sionvisited  the  People's  Republic\nof  China  (PRC)  from  18-24  October,  1991  and  held  discussions  with  the\nGovernment  officials  and  .representatives  of  international  agencies\nconcerned.  The  Mission  examined  the  need  for  the  TA  confirmed  the\nGovernment's  priority  and  discussed  the  sco~~,  terms  of  reference  for  the\nconsultants,  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  TA  first  appeared  in\nthe  ADB  Business  Opportunities  in  January  1992.\n- UCKGRO~\nA.\nGloba1  C1imat..  Chanae\n2.  Climate  change  resulting  from  excessive  concentrations  of\ngreenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere  has  become  one  of  the  most  critical\nglobal  environmental  issues.  The  first  assessment  report  on  climate\nchange,  prepared  in  August  1990  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate\nChange  (IPCC),  confirmed  the  human-induced  greenhouse  effect  and  predicted\nan  average  rate  of  increase  of  about  0.30  a  decade  in  the  global  mean\ntemperature  during  the  next  century.  Ba~ed  on  IPCC's  findings,\nintergovernmental  negotiations  were  initiated  to  formulate  a  framework\nconvention  on  climate  change.  The  major  issues  confronting  the  world  in\ndeveloping  a  global  level  mechanism  to  manage  climate  change  will  be\ndiscussed  at  the  United  Nattons  Conference  on  Environment  and  Development\n(UNCED),  scheduled  to  be  held  in  Brazil  in  Jun.  1992.\nE.~  Imolications  for  PRC\nf\nThe  PRC would  be  seriously  affected,  if  the  climate  change\noccurs  as  predicted,  because  (i)  the  economy  is  largely  based  on  natural\nresources,  which  are  susceptible  to  changes  in  climate  conditions,  (1i)\nt:he  country  is  vulnerable  to  extreme  weather  related  events  as\ndemonstrated  by  the  recent  heavy  rains  and  ensuing  widespread  floods,\nwhich  caused  a  loss  of  lives  and  the  destruction  of  buildings;  and  (iii)\nthe  country  is  already  burdened  with  other  pressing  problems  including\ndifferent  forms  of  environmental  degradation  and  ehortage  of  financial  and\ntechnical  resource8  to  adapt  to  and  respond  to  the  predicted  climate\nchange.  A  preliminary  impact  analysis  of  the  climate  change  indicates:\nf: i)  a  five  percent  1088  in  the  agricultural  production  in  the  PRC;  (ii)\na  considerable  reduction  in  timber  production  because  of  the  serious\nEtffects  on  four  of  the  six  major  timber  species  in  the  country,  and  (iii)\nE!xtensive  damage  in  major  coastal  areas,  including  the  Pearl  River  Delta\n~lnd  the  low  land  areas  along  the  Yangtze  River  and  the  Yellow  River.\ntI3.I..

The  PRC's  participation  in  international  programs  on  global\nclimate  change  is  es8ential.  However,  effective  participation  is  possible\nonlx  if  the  policies  and  measures  identified  are  implementable  in  the\ncontext  of  the  PRC's  limited  financial  and  technological  resources.  To\ndesign  effective  policies  and  programs,  a  large  scale  interdisciplinary\nstudy  is  nece8sary  because  the  PRC's  relationship  with  climate  change  is\nso  diverse  and  complicated,  both  in  the  positive  and  negative  sense.  The\nproposed  TA  will  be  instrwnental  in  a8sisting  the  PRC  chart  a  future\ncourse  of  action  to  effectively  deal  with  global  climate  change  in\ncooperation  with  other  countries  and  international  organizations.  The\nproposed  TA  is  consistent  with  the  Bank's  operational  strategies  for  the\nPRC,  and  8upport8  the  country's  efforts  to  protect  its  environment  and\nconserve  resources  and  to  minimize  the  damage  caused  by  natural  disasters\nas  specified  in  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  and  the  Ten-Year  Programme.\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Ob;ective\n11.  The  primary  objective  of  the  TA is  to  assist  the  PRC formulate\na  national  response  strategy  for  global  climate  change  through,  among\nother  thing8,  an  asse88ment  of  present  and  future  emissions  of  greenhou.e\nga!aes,  the  identification  and  evaluation  of  greenhouse  ga8  reductionme~lsure. \nand  a  macroeconomic  analysi.  of  the  selected  major  policy\noptions,  thereby  facilitating  the  PRC's  positive  participation  in  the\nglobal  efforts  to  manage  climate  change.\nB.\nSCO1)8  of'l'A\n12.  The  scope  of  the  TA includes  an  assessment  of  the  present  and\nan  estimate  of  the  future  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  pac  taking  into\naccount  the  recent  trends  in  major  .ocioeconomic  factors  including\npopulation  growth,  urbanization,  economic  growth  and  industrial\nrestructuring.  The  TA  will  identify  the  8hort-term  measure8  and  long-\nterm  meaaure.  needed  to  reduce  emi..iona  of  CO2 and  other  greenhou8e  ga.ee\nin  the  various  sectors  and  evaluate  the  effectivenes8  of  the  proposed\nmeasures.  Scenarios  will  be  developed  consisting  of  a  set  of  policy\noptions  for  implementing  the  mea.urea  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  ernie.ione.\nA macroeconomic  analysis  of  the  various  policy  options  will  be  undertaken\nto  determine  which  of  the  options  meet  the  Government'  s  future  development\nobjectives.  Based  on  the  as8essment  and  analysi8,  a  national  response\nstrategy  and  an  action  plan  will  be  prepared  consisting  of  short-term  and\nmedi~m-term  measures  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emi88ions.\nIII.", "5\n13.  A  national  symposium  on  the  National  Response  Strateqy  for\nClimate  Change  will  be  organized  to  discuss  the  draft  national  strategy\nand  ways  to  implement  the  action  plan.  The  symposium  will  be  organized\nb~r  SSTC  with  participants  from  the  other  government  ministries  and\na~lencies  concerned  and  international  organizations.\n1'~.

For  this  purpose,  a\ncoordinating  committee  consisting  of  SSTC,  NEPA,  UNDP,  World  Bank  and  the\nBank  will  be  established.
