Lack of technical skills and weak institutional capacity in economic management remain \nan impediment to economic development in most Pacific island countries. The small size of the \neconomies,  dispersed  populations,  and  remoteness  from  markets  make  it  difficult  to  cost-\neffectively provide high-quality technical assistance to these countries. The Pacific Financial \nTechnical  Assistance  Centre  (PFTAC)  was  established  as  a  regional  initiative  by  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in \n1993.1 Supporting  PFTAC  is  consistent  with  the  key  result  areas  outlined  in  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program 2004\u20132006.2 \nPFTAC  helps  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs)  enhance  financial  and \nadministrative reforms by providing technical advice and training in key financial and economic \nareas. Providing support through PFTAC has proven to be an efficient and cost-effective way to \nextend technical support in these critical areas.  \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) will support PFTAC operations over a 3-year funding cycle \n(2005\u20132008).3 The TA\u2019s objectives, scope, cost estimates and financing, and implementation \narrangements were agreed on during the PFTAC donors\u2019 meeting held in Suva, Fiji Islands, on \n4 November 2005. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The rationale for PFTAC is based on the need to address PDMCs\u2019 lack of technical skills \nand  institutional  capacity  to  formulate  and  implement  appropriate  economic  and  financial \npolicies. While technical assistance has been available, it has been difficult to build technical \nand institutional capacity that can be sustained nationally and cost-effectively to a large number \nof small and dispersed countries. The unique feature of PFTAC is its donor-coordinated regional \napproach to capture economies of scale in the delivery of technical assistance to PDMCs. \nAnother unique feature of PFTAC is its ability to respond quickly to PDMCs\u2019 needs and requests.  \n \n4.  PFTAC operates in 15 Pacific island developing countries4 with financial support from \nADB, IMF, and the governments of Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. IMF is the Executing \nAgency and manages PFTAC. The total budget amounts to about $2.3 million annually.5 Since \n1994, ADB has provided a total of about $3.6 million for seven regional TA projects to support \nPFTAC operations.6 All seven TA projects have been completed and rated as successful, \nparticularly because PFTAC is a cost-effective mechanism for providing high-quality assistance \nand ensuring the consistency of advice.  \n                                                 \n1  PFTAC was initially established as the Fiscal and Monetary Reform and Statistical Improvement Project. \n2  ADB. 2003. Pacific Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program 2004\u20132006. Manila. The key result areas include \n(i) strengthened government transparency and accountability, (ii) improved availability of and dissemination of \nquality  data  and  information  on  development  issues,  (iii)  enhanced  development  partner  coordination  and \nharmonization, and (iv) increased impact of regional cooperation. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 27 April 2005. \n4  Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua \nNew Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n5  PFTAC's budget is based on IMF\u2019s fiscal year of 1 May through 30 April.  \n6  ADB.  1994.

PFTAC provides assistance in four program areas: (i) public financial management, (ii) \ntax administration and policy, (iii) banking sector regulation and supervision, and (iv) economic \nand financial statistics. The TA is provided in the form of quick-response missions by PFTAC\u2019s \nresident advisers, on-the-job training, and in-country and regional seminars and workshops. \nPFTAC has also been instrumental in setting up a number of regional initiatives. \n \n6.  PFTAC\u2019s  services  in  the  four  program  areas  remain  relevant.  PFTAC  has  given \nconsistently high-quality advice and technical training, and a regional TA delivers them more \neffectively and efficiently than an individual TA. PFTAC also has the advantage of being able to \nprovide  quick-response  assistance  better  than  other  TA  delivery  modes.  An  additional \nadvantage is the access to technical backstopping by IMF. However, the small size of PFTAC\u2019s \nactivities and the fungibility with other donor-supported activities make it difficult to assess the \nspecific impact of PFTAC\u2019s technical advice and capacity building. Recently, more effort is being \nmade to track progress on reforms resulting from specific PFTAC advice. The high mobility and \nout-of-country migration of key government officials have posed a risk to sustainable impacts of \ntraining.  \n \n7.  PFTAC  faces  a  number  of  important  challenges  to  enhance  sustainable  capacity \nbuilding. A key challenge includes the need to continue to take advantage of and balance \nPFTAC\u2019s unique ability to provide quick-response assistance with the need to support long-term \nreform strategies in PDMCs and to complement and coordinate assistance with other capacity-\nbuilding initiatives undertaken by donors and other regional agencies. To achieve this objective, \nPFTAC will seek to enhance coordination, and improve follow-up and monitoring of progress of \ngovernments\u2019 actions in response to PFTAC\u2019s recommendations. Advisory missions will be \nmore closely integrated with on-the-job-training of government counterparts. PFTAC will, on a \npilot basis, take short-term in-house interns and PDMC secondments. ADB will continue its \npolicy dialogue with IMF, donors, and governments, through the Tripartite Review Committee \n(TPRC), on PFTAC\u2019s technical program areas and cost-effective service delivery.7 \n \n8.  Given the extreme vulnerability of the PDMCs to external shocks, their narrow economic \nand  human  skill  base,  distance  from  markets,  and  out-migration  rate  of  skilled  capacity, \ntechnical assistance for capacity development is likely to be needed and demanded for the \nforeseeable future. PFTAC is regarded as a high-quality, flexible, demand-responsive, and cost-\neffective way to address PDMCs\u2019 capacity constraints.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  will  help  address  the  continued  need  for  institutional  and  human  capacity \ndevelopment to improve policy systems and practices in the following four program areas: (i) \npublic financial management, (ii) tax administration and policy, (iii) banking sector regulation and \nsupervision, and (iv) economic and financial statistics. To improve sustainability of capacity-\nbuilding activities, PFTAC will enhance efforts to better coordinate activities with donors and \nprovide on-the-job training. Follow-up and monitoring of progress in key reform areas will be \nintegrated into PFTAC\u2019s country strategies. \n \n                                                 \n7  This may include the recommendations of the draft evaluation report (2005) by ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation \nDepartment, which will be explored with key stakeholders.  \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  PFTAC will continue to provide high-quality technical advice and training to promote (i) \nefficient, effective, and transparent budget formulation and presentation, budget execution and \ncontrol, and reporting and audit; (ii) simple and efficient revenue instruments and effective tax \nadministration capable of increasing tax compliance as well as modernized customs procedures \nto secure revenue and facilitate trade; (iii) compliance with international standards and best \npractices  in  prudential  supervision  regulation  techniques,  including  measures  to  defer  and \ndetect  money  laundering  and  to  combat  terrorism  financing;  and  (iv)  regular  and  timely \ncompilation, analysis, and dissemination of economic and financial statistics.  \n \n11.  Under each of the four program areas and in collaboration with the PDMC governments, \nPFTAC will prepare joint project proposals that employ gap analysis to devise agreed strategies \nand actions plans upon which PFTAC\u2019s work will be based. IMF will provide quality assurance \nand PFTAC will continue to access technical support and backstopping from IMF experts. \nPFTAC\u2019s resident advisors in the four program areas will be supported by short-term peripatetic \nassignments. These experts will work on follow-up of specific projects and be supervised by \nPFTAC\u2019s resident advisers. \n \n12.  PFTAC\u2019s country activities will respond to requests from the individual PDMCs, and \nregional activities will foster regional institutions and pursue training in areas that affect all \nPDMCs. On the basis of systematic stocktaking of activities to provide a base for regional efforts \nto  find  common  solutions  to  identified  problems  and  country  strategy  notes,  PFTAC  will \nundertake (i) high-quality and quick-response technical country missions and technical advice, \n(ii)  informal  on-the-job  training  of  counterparts,  (iii)  in-country  and regional  workshops,  (iv) \ndevelopment of training courses, and (v) organization of short-term attachments to relevant \norganizations and agencies.  \n \n13.  To  improve  monitoring  of  performance  and  effectiveness  of  activities,  PFTAC  will \nconduct periodic client satisfaction surveys and systematically monitor country requests and \nactions taken by governments in response to PFTAC\u2019s advice. PFTAC will prepare country \nreports that will monitor the reform progress in response to technical advice. PFTAC will also \ncontinue  to  conduct  surveys  to  receive  participants\u2019  feedback  on  workshops  and  training \nprograms. PFTAC will prepare 6-month reports to ADB that will include activities, inputs, costs \nand performance monitoring, including outputs and outcomes of the various activities. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of PFTAC's operations for the new 3-year project cycle (1 May 2005 to 30 \nApril 2008) is estimated at $7 million equivalent.8 The Government of Japan's contribution \namounts  to  $1.64  million  equivalent,  the  Government  of  New  Zealand\u2019s  to  $1.44  million \nequivalent, the Government of Australia\u2019s to $1.15 million, and the Government of the Republic \nof Korea\u2019s to $0.45 million. IMF's contribution amounts to $1.27 million equivalent. IMF has \nrequested ADB to contribute $0.80 million equivalent over the 3-year funding cycle. ADB\u2019s \nfinancing for the full project cycle will facilitate planning and effective resource use over the \nfinancing  cycle  and  will  be  consistent  with  the  financing  provided  by  other  donors.  The \nremaining will be financed by unused balance from the previous funding cycle. \n The views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n1m5e.m  berAs,D BBo\u2019asr dT Aof  cDoirnetcritbourst,i oMna onfa g$e0m.8e0n tm, oilrli ostna fwf, ialln sdu mppaoy rbt eP pFrTelAimCin oaprye irna tnioatnusre f.o  r the new 3-year \nproject cycle (1 May 2005 to 30 April 2008), and will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's \n                                                 \n8  The financing cycle covers 2005\u20132008.  \n ", "4   \nTA funding program.

The strategic direction of PFTAC operations is guided by the TPRC, which consists of \nrepresentatives of IMF, funding agencies, and participating countries. The TPRC chair is the  \ngovernor of the Reserve Bank in Fiji. Meetings of the TPRC take place every 12\u201318 months. \nIMF will continue to be the Executing Agency for the TA. IMF is responsible for all substantive \ntechnical support and backstopping of the resident advisers. All accounting, reporting, and \nauditing procedures will be consistent with the provisions set forth in IMF\u2019s overall framework \naccount.  \n \n17.  PFTAC will provide country performance status reports, 6-month progress reports, and \nperformance monitoring on its activities, outputs, and outcomes to ADB and the other external \nfunding agencies. Quarterly cost reports will show the breakdown of expenditure. PFTAC will \nundertake satisfaction surveys following completion of projects. ADB will participate in meetings \nof the TPRC. The TPRC provides guidance on the strategic direction of PFTAC and monitors \nPFTAC\u2019s effectiveness of outputs in meeting PDMCs\u2019 needs. The project coordinator will be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of PFTAC and its operations. PFTAC will develop \ncountry strategies and on this basis prepare 3-month rolling work plan for PFTAC advisers. \nThese will be submitted to ADB and other donors for comments. This will ensure that PFTAC's \nassistance complements and supports other donor assistance to the PDMCs. The work plans \nwill  be  supplemented  by  a  table  showing  the  objectives,  strategies,  functions,  and  action \ntimetables for each ongoing activity within the program areas for each country. \n \n18.  IMF will recruit and support PFTAC\u2019s project coordinator, international resident advisers, \nand  short-term  consultants  in  accordance  with  its  standard  practices.  IMF's  selection \nprocedures are consistent with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB\u2019s funding will \nbe confined to benefiting ADB\u2019s PDMCs. Where relevant skills are available within the PDMCs, \nIMF will endeavor to use experts from within the region. National authorities may be asked to \nnominate possible officials who could be seconded for short-term assignments with PFTAC. The \ninternational resident advisers and short-term consultants financed by ADB's contribution will be \nnationals  of  ADB  member  countries,  and  engagement  will  take  place  after  appropriate \nconsultations with ADB. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  Funds under this TA will be disbursed annually.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.

Program Area: Revenue Policy and Administration  \n1.       At the national level, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) will do \nthe following: \n(i)  Assist PFTAC member countries in the diagnosis of their revenue administration \nand  development  of  strategic  reform  and  modernization  plans.  In  doing  so, \nPFTAC will work closely with donors and other agencies assisting the Pacific \ndeveloping member countries (PDMCs) to ensure that advice is coordinated and \nimplementation can be well targeted. \n(ii)  Advise on the administrative and economic efficiency of existing indirect taxes, \ncorporate and personal taxes, payroll and social security contributions, property \ntaxes, and tariff policies. \n(iii)  Help improve the effectiveness of tax and customs administration, including via \nincreased tax compliance, strengthened collection, audit, and taxpayer services, \nand  by  establishing  special  collection  arrangements  for  larger  business \ntaxpayers.  \n(iv)  Advise on implementing new taxes, and introducing measures to bring medium-\nsized and small taxpayers into the tax net.  \n \n2.       National activities will continue to be the main focus, while a number of regional activities \nwill also be pursued in cooperation with donors and PFTAC member countries: \n(i)  Working in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Fiscal Affairs \nDepartment, PFTAC will undertake a regional review of possible areas where \nfiscal revenue may be enhanced. This will include a survey of existing revenue \ninstruments and administrative practices to determine possible strategies and \npolicies that may need to be adjusted, particularly to accommodate possible \ntrade liberalization and regional integration measures. Upon request, PFTAC will \nassist with follow-up actions through the design of action plans to implement the \nreforms in conjunction with other donors. \n(ii)  Support to the Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association will be continued. \nPFTAC  will  provide  funding  and  act  as  secretariat  for  the  second  annual \nconference in August 2005, and focusing on performance measurement and \nmonitoring of tax administration. Beyond this, support from other donors and \ntechnical assistance (TA) providers will also be sought. \n(iii)  With support from IMF\u2019s Fiscal Affairs Department, PFTAC will explore with the \nprincipal  donors,  and  with  organizations  such  as  the  Oceania  Customs \nOrganization and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, the desirability of a \ncustoms reform framework that would help coordinate current regional programs, \nfacilitate and focus planning, and enable monitoring and reporting of progress \ntoward regional customs objectives.  \n(iv)  Selected  training  seminars  will  be  developed  for  customs  and  taxation \nadministrators, including on such issues as valuation and auditing procedures.  \n(v)  Other capacity-building activities will be done, including preparation of standard \noperational  manuals  and  guidelines  for  tax  offices,  notably  guidelines  for \nperforming  different forms of audit and collection enforcement activities, and \ncustoms offices (including newly revised procedures, new techniques such as \naudit,  post-clearance  compliance  checks,  and  risk  management),  and \npreparation of standard publicity and education materials for revenue agencies. \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \nB.  Program Area: Public Financial Management \n3.       At the national level, PFTAC will do the following: \n(i)  Help formulate, and/or review implementation of, individual PDMCs\u2019 strategies \nand action plans for public financial management reform and the sequencing of \nthe reform activities. \n(ii)  Provide  specific  TA  and  training  relating  to  strengthening  budget  planning, \npreparation,  execution  and  reporting,  government  accounting  and  debt \nmanagement systems, and internal control and audit capacity. \n(iii)  Maintain open communications with donors to improve coordination of policy \nadvice and TA. \n \n4.       PFTAC will work with PDMCs and donors to pursue three regional interrelated public \nfinancial management activities: \n(i)  Identify  the  fiscal  reform  associated  with  regional  integration  and  the \nestablishment of free trade. This study will mainly focus on preparing an issues \npaper  on  the  development  of  medium-term  fiscal  frameworks  and  helping \ncountries develop capacities to undertake macroeconomic projections and policy \nanalysis in this context. \n(ii)  Promote  good  governance  and  accountability,  consistent  with  IMF\u2019s  Eight \nPrinciples of Accountability1 and, as appropriate, IMF's Code of Good Practice on \nFiscal Transparency. Activities in this area will be designed to support the Forum \nEconomic  Ministers  Meeting\u2019s  (FEMM)  commitment  to  the  adoption  of  the \nprinciples and the biennial stocktaking of implementation. \n(iii)  Promote sound debt management as a key component of a holistic approach to \nimproved  fiscal  management.  PFTAC  will  work  with  IMF\u2019s  Asia-Pacific \nDepartment, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and other donor agencies to help \nauthorities develop reliable and up-to-date public debt profiles and ensure that \nboth the level and rate of growth of public debt are sustainable and that the debt \nis  serviceable  under  a  wide  range  of  circumstances.
