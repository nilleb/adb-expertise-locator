INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Southeast Asia is one of the most dynamic regions in the world. Its resilience and growth \ncontinued  even  through  the  recent  global  financial  and  economic  turmoil.  The  region\u2019s \ndevelopment  and  integration  are  expected  to  gain  momentum  with  the  realization  of  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community (AEC) by the end of \n2015. ASEAN is already the third-largest economy in Asia and the seventh-largest economy in \nthe world. Continued commitment and cooperation to realize the AEC is also expected to further \nfuel the region\u2019s growth, integration, and competitiveness within the global economy.1 \n \n2.  Despite ASEAN\u2019s progress and prospects, achieving the AEC targets and milestones by \nthe end of 2015 remains a significant challenge. In fact, a study on the AEC targets by the \nASEAN Secretariat indicates that removing connectivity constraints remains the most significant \nchallenge.2 Even after the AEC comes into being, considerable efforts will be needed to further \nstrengthen connectivity (in terms of both hardware and software) within the region and with the \nrest of the world. As these challenges persist, there is still a tremendous need to build capacities \nto enhance connectivity\u2014physical, institutional, and people-to-people\u2014as defined in the Master \nPlan for ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC).3 More specifically, the implementation of the agreed \ntargets  and  arrangements  under  the  MPAC  and  the  AEC  will  require  substantial  capacity \ndevelopment, institutional strengthening, as well as policy reforms as preconditions to achieving \nan integrated, inclusive, and sustainable AEC.4  \n \n3.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  working  to  promote  connectivity  in \nSoutheast Asia through three subregional cooperation programs: (i) the Brunei Darussalam\u2013\nIndonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), (ii) the Indonesia\u2013\nMalaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT), and (iii) the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nEconomic Cooperation Program. While these programs have achieved considerable success in \npromoting connectivity, continued efforts are needed for effective MPAC implementation.5 The \ndesign and monitoring framework has been formulated based on these requirements and is in \nAppendix 1.6 \n                                                \n1  Southeast Asia\u2019s economic integration, which facilitates its outreach to neighboring economies, is becoming more \nsignificant. For example, the ASEAN\u2013China Free Trade Area (2010) is the largest free trade area in terms of \npopulation and the third largest in terms of nominal gross domestic product. Trade between ASEAN and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China reached 43% of intra-ASEAN trade in 2009. \n2  ASEAN Secretariat. 2012. AEC Scorecard. Jakarta.  \n3  ASEAN Secretariat. 2011. Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity. Jakarta. The MPAC was formally endorsed by the \nASEAN leaders in 2010. It represents an in-depth plan of action based on (i) a list of priority projects for ASEAN \nconnectivity, (ii) requirements for institutional and policy coordination, and (iii) recommendations for financing key \nprojects. The executive summary outlines MPAC\u2019s three-pronged strategy for connectivity\u2014physical, institutional, \nand people-to-people connectivity. \n4  The MPAC is consistent with the recent study on ASEAN connectivity (ADB Institute. 2014. ASEAN 2030: Toward \nA Borderless Economic Community. Tokyo). The study identifies major challenges for the future in the region. It \nfurther emphasizes the need for capacity development in terms of resilience to handle volatilities and shocks from \nwithin or outside the region and competitiveness to promote a business environment where successful firms \noperate in efficient markets under effective national and regional regulations. \n5  The MPAC has identified 15 priority projects for the region: (i) ASEAN Highway; (ii)  the Singapore Kunming Rail \nLink; (iii) ASEAN Broadband Corridor; (iv) Melaka-Pekan Baru Interconnection; (v) West Kalimantan-Sarawak \nInterconnection; (vi) the Roll-on/roll-off network; (vii) mutual recognition arrangements for priority  industries; (viii) \ncommon  rules  for  standards  and  conformity  assessment  procedures;  (ix)  National  Single  Windows;  (x) \nframework/modality  towards  the  phased  reduction  of  scheduled  investment  restrictions;  (xi)  the  ASEAN \nAgreements on transport facilitation; (xii) easing visa requirements for ASEAN nationals; (xiii) development of \nASEAN Virtual Learning Resources Centres; (xiv) develop ICT skill standards; and (xv) ASEAN Community \nbuilding programme. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 September 2014. ADB will not \nundertake any activities until a no-objection in writing is obtained from relevant developing member countries. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  In the  GMS,  ADB  has  supported  capacity  building for  subregional  cooperation  and \nconnectivity since 2002 through the Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management Program. \nWhile the Phnom Penh Plan has achieved considerable results, it has also provided important \nlessons for designing a capacity building program that encompasses member countries of \nBIMP-EAGA, IMT-GT, as well as the GMS. Taking from the results of an evaluation study7, key \ndesign changes for any proposed successor programs should include (i) expanding the program \nto non-GMS countries, but retaining specific focus on Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam; (ii) enhancing the program\u2019s operational focus, relevancy, \nand linkages; and (iii) developing partnerships with research and training institutions to promote \ngreater  outreach  and  more  sustainable  knowledge  sharing.  Further,  these  design \nenhancements would need to be accomplished with a reduced number of training sessions, in \nconsideration of administrative and budgetary constraints.8 \n \n5.  Drawing from the experience gained and knowledge shared through the Phnom Penh \nPlan, the proposed regional technical assistance (TA) will maintain the overall capacity building \nobjective of the Phnom Penh Plan, but with a sharpened focus on connectivity while broadening \nparticipation to include BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT members. The new program will be closely \naligned with and support the overall framework of the MPAC on regional connectivity and other \nrelevant  initiatives  (especially  from  the  subregional  programs)  to  build  on  the  AEC.  The \nprogram\u2019s focused scope will ensure that implementation of the TA is results-based. Accordingly, \nthe TA will consist of a series of training programs for government officials to enhance their \ncapacities  in  advancing  physical,  institutional,  and  people-to-people  connectivity  within  the \nregion. \n \n6.  ADB's Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy recognizes connectivity as an \nimportant  strategic  pillar  for  economic  cooperation  and  integration.9 It  further  notes  that \ninfrastructure hardware needs to be combined with software components. The expansion of \nregional connectivity is also reflected in ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.10 Overall, this \nrequires strong consensus and cooperation among the relevant countries at policy, regulatory, \nand institutional levels. For the developing member countries within ASEAN, developing a \ncapacity building program aligned with the MPAC provides a clear focus for the TA\u2019s scope, \nexpected outcome, and outputs \u2013 since the MPAC represents the detailed policy framework for \nASEAN  on  the  issues  related  to  connectivity.  The  TA  will  seek  to  partner  with  existing \ninstitutions and initiatives which also support ASEAN for possible synergies and alignment of \ninitiatives. Based on preliminary discussions, the ASEAN\u2013Korea Center in the Republic of \nKorea and the Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative of the People\u2019s Republic of China have \nindicated strong interest to collaborate in implementing the program.11 Additional consultations \nwill be initiated with similar institutions within the region and with the ASEAN Secretariat; the \nnational secretariats of the GMS, IMT-GT, and BIMP-EAGA; and key development partners.  \n                                                \n7  ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n8  The major lessons learned from Phnom Penh Plan include the need for (i) selection of learning programs with more \nsharpened focus and customization; (ii) better targeting of participants involved in programs and projects; (iii) \nfollow-up and deepening of programs; (iv) progressive development of technical and financial sustainability; (v) \nmore active roles of the institutions (both research and training), despite their weak capacities; (vi) development of \na pool of GMS trainers and experts; and (vii) enhancement of learning materials. \n9  ADB. 2006.

It has been promoting policy dialogue, knowledge sharing, and operation \ntraining among the countries.  \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA will be the accelerated implementation of the MPAC for enhanced \nconnectivity in the region. The outcome will be greater capacity of government officials in the \nregion  to  develop  and  implement  projects,  programs,  and  policies  in  support  of  MPAC \nconnectivity pillars. Members of BIMP-EAGA, IMT-GT, and the GMS will be the main target \nbeneficiaries of this TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The outputs will be (i) a comprehensive training program delivered; and (ii) an internet-\nbased  information  repository  established,  to  be  shared  with  alumni,  developing  member \ncountries, and partner institutions. Based on the three MPAC connectivity pillars (as listed \nbelow), the training program will include the following: \n(i)  Physical connectivity. The MPAC\u2019s goal for physical connectivity is to develop \nan  integrated  and  well-functioning  intermodal  transport,  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT), and energy networks in ASEAN. Accordingly, \nthe TA\u2019s program will include capacity building support for transport and trade \nfacilitation and regional energy initiatives (such as the ASEAN Power Grid and \nother regional energy-related programs); ICT development (including for public \nsector management, trade and customs development, among others); as well as \nlegal, institutional, and regulatory policies for promoting greater connectivity and \ncoordination in these sectors.12 \n(ii)  Institutional connectivity. The MPAC\u2019s goal for institutional connectivity is to \nsupport  regional  trade  and  investment  (including  private  investments)  via \nenhanced legal and institutional mechanisms. Greater institutional coordination \nwill be promoted among central government agencies and between the central \ngovernment and local government agencies. In response to the challenge of \nrapid urbanization in the region, the TA will promote coordination and training of \nmunicipal  agencies  and  institutions  in  urban  planning,  environmental \nmanagement,  and  economic  corridor  development.  Building  upon  efforts  to \nintegrate the finance sector in the region, the TA will also support coordination \nand training for financial institutions on regulatory policies and risk management. \nBy linking key academic, research, and training institutions in the region, the TA \nwill help build a sustainable knowledge-sharing network. To help address the \nspecific  capability  development  needs  of  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam,  sharing  of  knowledge  and \nexperience between countries will be encouraged, especially from middle-income \ncountries. \n(iii)  People-to-people  connectivity.  The  MPAC\u2019s  goal  for  people-to-people \nconnectivity  is  to  promote  education,  support  human  resource  development, \nencourage innovation and entrepreneurship, and promote tourism. Accordingly, \nthe TA\u2019s program will include policy and advisory support for promoting tourism \nas  well  as  for  addressing  issues  such  as  social  protection,  control  of \ncommunicable diseases, and other regional public goods. The ASEAN 2030 \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n12 The GMS Regional Investment Framework could serve as an anchor for operationalizing knowledge and capacity \ndevelopment for physical connectivity pillar. The training programs on the infrastructure sector would also include \ncomponents on the potential impact on the environment and climate change. \n ", "4   \nstudy  (footnote  4)  presented  a  number  of  recommendations  that  will  be \nsupported by the TA.  \n \n9.  The training program will also be designed to include practical, project-based topics \ndirectly relevant to and supportive of ADB operations.13 Potential subject areas and the relevant \nSoutheast  Asia  Department  (SERD)  divisions  that  will  assume  leadership  roles  include  (i) \ntransport and trade facilitation (Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division \n[SERC]); (ii) economic zones, corridor towns, and green cities (Urban Development and Water \nDivision);  (iii)  agriculture  value  chains  and  green  freight  corridors  (Environment,  Natural \nResources  and  Agriculture  Division);  (iv)  cross-border  infrastructure  and  training  for  ICT \ndevelopment  (Transport  and  Communications  Division);  (v)  cross-border  power  sharing \nagreements and renewable energy (Energy Division); (vi) education, vocational training, and \ntourism (Human and Social Development Division); and (vii) finance sector development, small \nand medium-sized enterprises, and public\u2013private partnerships (Public Management, Financial \nSector and Trade Division). Other subject areas will be determined in close consultation with \nADB knowledge departments and communities of practice, as appropriate. \n \n10.  It  is  expected  that  about  2\u20133  training  activities  will  be  undertaken  per  year.  It  is \nenvisioned that a detailed training program and schedule will be completed by mid-2015, based \non a needs assessment of the countries and consultations with the recipient countries. The \ntarget trainees are government officials who will be identified based on consultations with the \nrecipient countries, ADB sector divisions, and resident missions. It is also envisioned that, as a \nresult  of  the  training,  additional  opportunities  for  networking,  consultations,  and  dialogues \namong members will be facilitated. Accordingly, the TA will foster the development of specific, \nneeds-based  knowledge-sharing  activities  and  appropriate  delivery  mechanisms.  While  the \ntraining program as outlined above is the key output of the TA, another important TA output is \nthe establishment of an internet-based information repository system accessible to all relevant \nmembers and partner institutions. An annual release of the evaluation and outcome reports for \nboth training and the repository system is envisioned. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which (i) $250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and (ii) $500,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. \nThe  fund  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  will  be \nadministered by ADB. It is also expected that nonrecipient countries in Southeast Asia (e.g., \nSingapore) as well as participating middle-income countries will support the TA implementation \nvia  technical  contributions  and  hosting  of  some  training  activities.  Specific  details  will  be \nfinalized during the early phase of the TA implementation.14 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The TA is expected to be implemented from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. ADB \nwill be the executing agency. SERC of ADB\u2019s SERD will manage TA implementation. Additional \nsupport will be provided by other ADB sector divisions in SERD, as well as by ADB knowledge \n                                                \n13 The key assumption for the delivery of these outputs is that the design of the training activities is effective and \nappropriate, while the risk is the limited absorptive capacity of the nominated government officials participating in \nthe training program. \n14 Officials from high-income countries (e.g., Brunei Darussalam) are expected to bear the cost of their participation in \ntraining programs. Nongovernment officials could also be invited to participate in some events. \n ", "  5 \ndepartments, resident missions, and communities of practice. Externally, the TA will foster \npartnerships with existing knowledge and research institutions with the objective of providing \njoint training activities.15 Such partnerships should also promote enhanced sustainability of the \ncapacity development efforts through an internet-based information repository system, which will \ncontain training materials and research on the subject areas covered by the TA. \n \n13.  A team of SERD staff members will form a working group to design and implement the \ntraining program. Each of the sector divisions within SERD will nominate one international staff \nmember as a focal point to work on the key training areas identified in para. 8-9. In addition, \nADB\u2019s knowledge departments and communities of practice may also be involved in designing \nand implementing relevant training programs. This effort will be coordinated by SERC. SERC \nstaff  including  two  professional  staff  members,  one  national  officer,  and  one  operations \nassistant  will  consolidate  consultants'  outputs  and  coordinate  and  administer  consultant \ncontracts. The outputs will be reviewed by the working group. Where appropriate, ADB staff \ncould serve as resource persons. Prioritization and sequencing of the training programs will be \nbased on consultations with the participating countries which are also expected to form a task \nforce to support TA implementation. In addition, the TA will, to the extent possible, coordinate \nwith the relevant ASEAN working groups and other regional bodies to help identify the needs, \npolitical support, and awareness of ADB activities in the countries. \n \n14.  It is estimated that 12 person-months of international consulting services and 12 person-\nmonths of national consulting services are required for the TA.16 Individual consultants will be \nrecruited  on  an  intermittent  basis,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Purchases of equipment (computer hardware and software) will be undertaken in a \ncost-efficient manner in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time) and in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology \nand Office of Administrative Services, where applicable. After the TA completion, any procured \nequipment will be disposed of in compliance with ADB guidelines. Disbursements under the TA \nwill be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis \nfor Building Capacity for Enhanced Connectivity in Southeast Asia, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n15 This also includes the existing institutions for training and government agencies that have participated in the \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nimplementation of the Phnom Penh Plan. Finally, since there are other ADB initiatives and TA projects which \nsupport ASEAN capacity development, close coordination with the relevant sector divisions will avoid overlap while \nseeking synergies. \n16 Based on the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, the use of more output-based contracts and lump-sum out-of-\npocket expense payments will be explored during TA implementation. \n ", "Appendix 1  6 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nAccelerated  By 2020:  Regional data on trade,  Continued emphasis on \nimplementation of the  Designed and commenced  investment, physical  the effective \nMPAC for enhanced  implementation of at least  connectivity, policy  implementation of the \nconnectivity in the  8 out of 15 priority projects  coordination, and  ASEAN Economic \nregion  as identified in the MPAC   movement of people  Community \n  across the region  commitments and the \nBaseline (2014): None of  MPAC among the \nthe MPAC priority projects  member countries of \nhas been completed  the BIMP-EAGA, GMS, \n  and IMT-GT \n   \n    Risk \nPolitical and \n   \nmacroeconomic \nenvironment changes \nact as barriers to the \ncontinued efforts \ntowards regional \ncooperation and \nintegration \nOutcome      Assumption \nGreater capacity of  At least 150 government  Annual evaluation  Government officials \ngovernment officials  officials trained on key  reports  have appropriate \nin the region to  aspects of connectivity    incentives to apply the \ndevelop and  (which aims to link the  Feedback from  knowledge and skills \nimplement projects,  members of BIMP-EAGA,  participants  acquired \nprograms, and  IMT-GT, and GMS) by the     \npolicies in support of  end of 2017  Reports and evaluations  Risk \nMPAC connectivity    of the MPAC  External factors limit the \npillars  At least 70% of  implementation  ability of government \ngovernment officials  officials to effectively \nparticipating in the  participate in the \nprogram indicate that the  program (e.g., budget \nTA has provided effective  constraints and policy \ntools for policy formulation  shifts, among others) \nand implementation to \npromote effective support \nfor the three pillars of the \nMPAC (physical, \ninstitutional, and people-to-\npeople connectivity) by the \nend of 2017 \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

Individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  support  technical  assistance  (TA) \nimplementation. It is estimated that 12 person-months of international consulting services and \n12 person-months of national consulting services are required. The indicative person-month \nrequirements, tasks, and minimum qualifications of consultants are as follows: \n \nA.  Team Leader and/or Training Specialist (international, 12 person-months on \nintermittent basis) \n \n2.  Under the supervision of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the team leader will (i) \nmanage the day-to-day implementation and operation of the TA project\u2019s training program; and \n(ii) develop and support the implementation of the training programs. The team leader (i) should \nhave a strong background in the management and delivery of capacity building and training \nprograms in developing countries, preferably in Southeast Asia; and (ii) must have international \nwork experience in the design, organization, and implementation of learning programs for civil \nservants and other capacity-development-related activities. Specific tasks include the following: \n(i)  Develop an overall work plan for the training program, in collaboration with the \nresponsible ADB staff, including details of the training program, participant levels, \nselection criteria, evaluation methods, and budgets. \n(ii)  Support ADB to forge a consensus among the member countries for finalizing the \ntraining program scope and schedule. \n(iii)  Coordinate  with  partner  institutions  to  formulate  the  training  materials  and \nmodules. \n(iv)  Outline ongoing initiatives and TA programs by ADB and others in Southeast \nAsia to maximize synergy and avoid overlaps. \n(v)  Develop a framework for an internet-based information repository system based \non past and ongoing training materials. \n(vi)  Undertake  training  program  management  to  (a)  assess  the  effectiveness  of \nprograms and review feedback and evaluations from faculty, institutional partners, \nand participants; (b) perform further training needs analyses; (c) explore web-\nbased learning possibilities; and (d) supervise preparation of study materials. \n(vii)  Identify appropriate trainers and training institutions under the guidance of ADB \nstaff. \n(viii)  Work with teaching faculty and resource persons in the design, delivery, and \nevaluation of learning programs and course materials. \n(ix)  Monitor training program implementation and provide necessary inputs for the \noverall evaluation on an annual basis. \n(x)  Provide recommendations to ADB staff in responding to specific training requests \nunder the training program. \n \n3.  The specialist should have (i) extensive experience in the development, evaluation, and \ndelivery of inputs on training and capacity development in Asia and the Pacific; and (ii) at least \n10 years of experience in the relevant field. A degree in economics or public administration is \npreferred. \n \nB.  Program Analyst (national, 12 person-months on intermittent basis) \n \n4.  Under the supervision of the team leader, the program analyst will manage the day-to-\nday implementation and operation of the TA project\u2019s training program. The program analyst \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nshould have a strong background in program management, and experience in and exposure to \ndevelopment management and capacity building. The specific tasks include the following: \n(i)  Support  the  implementation  of  the  work  plan  for  the  training  program,  in \ncollaboration  with  the  responsible  ADB  staff  and  the  team  leader,  including \ndetails of the training program, participant levels, selection criteria, evaluation \nmethods, and budgets. \n(ii)  Develop a web-based database on past and ongoing course materials and other \nmaterials (Output 2) based on the framework as formulated by the team leader. \n(iii)  Provide  all  relevant  logistical  support  for  the  training  activities,  including  the \npreparation of budget estimates and facility use, among others. \n(iv)  Support ADB staff in developing the future direction and scope of the training \nprogram. \n \n5.  The analyst should have (i) extensive experience in the development, evaluation, and \ndelivery of capacity development inputs in Asia and the Pacific; and (ii) at least 5 years of \nexperience in the relevant field. A degree in economics or public administration is preferred. \n \nC.  Resource Persons (international and national) \n \n6.  The TA will also consider recruiting resource persons to support and undertake the \nrelevant training activities. About 3 person-months in total could be allocated for the resource \npersons for the duration of the TA.1 The specific number of resource persons and scope of their \nwork will be based on each of the planned activities. \n                                                \n1  This is based on the assumption that around two resource persons would be recruited per training program (1 \nweek each), or around 0.5 person-months. There will be around three programs per year, so it would be around 1.5 \nperson-months annually. Since the TA implementation period is 2 years, a total of 3 person-months would be \nexpected. The required resource can be allocated from the workshop or training budget. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20150106104139+08'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "adb technical assistance ta report", "ModDate": "D:20150108103849+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.10", "Title": "Building Capacity for Enhanced Connectivity in Southeast Asia"}}
