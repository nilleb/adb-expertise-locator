I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Local Government Enhancement \nSector Project.1 The report also describes proposed capacity development technical assistance \n(TA) for Local Government Service Enhancement, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The outcome of the project will be improved local infrastructure and services delivered \neffectively by local authorities in less-developed areas of Sri Lanka. Under the project, about \n100  local  authorities  selected  in  seven  provinces  (excluding  the  Northern  and  Eastern \nprovinces), whose reform plans are reviewed and confirmed by the government, will implement \nsubprojects  for  roads  and  bridges,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  drainage,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and other basic facilities, including building or enhancing health-care centers and \npublic markets. The project will support the institutional strengthening of the local authorities for \nimproved and sustainable service delivery through business process reengineering and the \ndevelopment of their information technology (IT) systems.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  government\u2019s  development  policy  framework  highlights  the  need  for  balanced \nregional  development  to  ensure  that  every  household  in  Sri  Lanka  benefits  equally  from \neconomic  development.3 It  stresses  the  need  to  channel  more  resources  to  the  poorer \nsegments of the population to rectify rural\u2013urban imbalances and improve access to social and \neconomic infrastructure including transport, drinking water supply, and public health care. While \nthe urban population is growing at 3.0% per annum and is expected to encompass half the \ncountry\u2019s total population by 2016, there is a large infrastructure deficit in peri-urban and small \ntownships in rural areas. Current local service deficiencies include (i) intermittent or limited \nwater supply services in many townships; (ii) dilapidated local roads that hamper connectivity \nand economic and social activities; (iii) haphazard solid waste management that includes a lack \nof suitable landfill sites, causing nuisance and public health risks; (iv) limited primary health-care \nfacilities; (v) inadequate drainage, causing waterlogging in township areas; and (vi) inadequate \npublic market facilities that hinder local economic activity. While poverty affects the general \npopulation  in  lagging  regions,  the  economic  and  social  activities  of  women  are  severely \nconstrained  by  poor  infrastructure  and  services.  Poverty  is  concentrated  in  areas  where \nconnectivity to towns and markets is relatively low.4 Improving infrastructure and service delivery \nstandards in these areas is constrained by the limited financial, technical, and management \ncapacity  of  local  authorities  responsible  for  local  service  delivery  under  a  decentralized \nadministrative system. \n \n4.  Sri Lanka has three types of local authorities under nine provincial councils: (i) municipal \ncouncils constituted in cities and large towns, (ii) urban councils for less urbanized areas, and \n(iii) pradeshiya sabhas5 in peri-urban and rural areas.6 To respond to the needs of improving \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA, financed on a grant basis from the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2010.

", "2          \nbasic  infrastructure  and  services  in  local  authorities,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved  the  Local  Government  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  (LGIIP)  in  2005.7 In \nalignment  with  the  government's  devolved  structure,  local  authorities  are  implementing \nsubprojects for water supply, roads, drainage and sewerage, and other municipal facilities, \nincluding constructing or renovating public libraries, health-care centers, and office buildings. \nThe LGIIP adopted a bottom\u2013up, demand-driven approach that follows the priorities set out by \nlocal authorities and is being implemented successfully. Most, if not all, outcome indicators will \nbe  achieved  by  project  completion,  along  with  improvement  in  the  financial  management \ncapacity of local authorities. Unlike the common practice of grant-based financing for basic \ninfrastructure improvement, partial debt financing has provided local authorities with stronger \nownership and incentives to improve revenue collection and financial management.8 \n \n5.  One limitation of the LGIIP is that poor and financially weak pradeshiya sabhas are \nunable to benefit because of their financial constraints. These local authorities are often located \nin remote areas; have very small revenue bases, if any; and collect very limited revenues \nthrough assessment taxes, rental fees, and licenses. To objectively identify less-developed \nareas where economic and social infrastructure and services are limited and the capacity of \npradeshiya  sabhas  is  weak,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Provincial  Councils \n(MLGPC)  established  a  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  pradeshiya  sabhas,  covering  (i) \ngeographic location and demography, (ii) social infrastructure and quality of life, (iii) physical \ninfrastructure  and  services,  (iv)  financial  strength  and  resources,  and  (v)  local  authority \nmanagement  capacity.9 Based  on  the  evaluation  results,  the  MLGPC  selected  about  100 \npradeshiya sabhas with high scores (i.e., poor infrastructure with weak capacity) in seven \nprovinces  (excluding  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces)  eligible  for  infrastructure \nimprovement support under the project.10 \n \n6.  Many development partners including ADB are prioritizing support to the Northern and \nEastern provinces, where reconstruction and development needs are high after the end of the \narmed conflict in mid-2009.11 This includes grant financing to all local authorities in the two \nprovinces for service improvement.12 However, poverty is found not only in the Northern and \nEastern  provinces  but  in  other  provinces  as  well.  Districts  in  Sabaragamuwa,  Uva,  North \nWestern, Southern, and Central provinces recorded a poverty headcount index higher than 10% \nin 2009/2010, while the national average dropped from 15.2% in 2006/2007 to 8.9%.13 Despite a \ndecline in the poverty index nationwide, the Gini-coefficient, an indicator of inequality, has \nremained constant at 0.47 since 2002.14 There is a need to provide resources to less-developed \nareas of the country to help achieve balanced regional development. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \n6  There are 22 municipal councils, 42 urban councils, and 271 pradeshiya sabhas in the country in 2011. \n7  ADB. 2005.

", "3 \n \n7.  Although local governments are vested with powers regarding various aspects of local \nadministration, including the provision of physical infrastructure, many of them, particularly \npradeshiya sabhas, face a number of challenges in exercising their powers because of their \nlimited own sources of revenue, resulting high dependence on fiscal transfers from the central \ngovernment, and limited technical capacity in physical planning, implementing infrastructure \nprojects, and managing the assets created. Offices are hardly computerized and not operated \nin  an  efficient  and  citizen-friendly  manner.  Taxation,  licensing,  and  approval  systems  and \nprocesses in local governments leave room for streamlining to attract more business. The \ngovernment is currently reforming the local government system through amendments to acts \nand ordinances governing local government, with the aim of reengineering business processes, \nenhancing citizen participation, expanding local authorities\u2019 functions, and enhancing revenue \nbases.15 Local infrastructure improvement will be most effective if it is implemented along with \nreform in local government that strengthens its capacity. \n \n8.  The  project  will  follow  a  sector  lending  modality.  Building  on  the  government \ndevelopment policy framework and the National Policy on Local Government adopted in 2009, \nthe Local Government Development Plan, which is a medium-term sector development plan of \nthe MLGPC, has been formulated.16 The plan has two pillars: (i) advancing the reform of local \ngovernment  systems,  as  stated  above,  and  (ii)  improving  infrastructure  and  services, \nparticularly  in  areas  with  deficient  services.  The  MLGPC  has  the  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement the plan with support provided through the project and TA. The project will play a \nkey role in assisting the government in implementing both pillars of the plan and is expected to \nachieve great impact toward strengthening the financial and management capacity of local \nauthorities. \n \n9.  Lessons from previous projects and evaluation in Sri Lanka include the need to (i) \nconfirm the commitment of local governments prior to their participation in the project, (ii) link \ninvestments  with  reforms  and  continued  institutional  strengthening,  (iii)  provide  continuous \ncapacity-building support toward handing over the management of water schemes to local \nauthorities and community-based organizations, and (iv) incorporate greater consultation and \nparticipatory processes into project design and implementation.17 Lessons learned from the \nongoing LGIIP include the need to (i) integrate multiple subprojects in the same areas to create \ndiscernable  development  impacts,  (ii)  focus  on  social  and  economic  infrastructure \nimprovement, (iii) identify and prepare subprojects early, and (iv) engage consultants for the \ndesign and supervision of subprojects to augment the capacity of local authorities. These \nrecommendations were considered in designing the project. \n \n10.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  second  pillar\u2014achieving  socially  inclusive \ndevelopment\u2014and  the  urban  sector  road  map  of  ADB\u2019s  Sri  Lanka  country  partnership \nstrategy.18 The project will address priority issues of the strategy including (i) better service \ndelivery  through  decentralized  decision-making;  (ii)  improved  basic  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure,  particularly  in  regions  that  lag  in  development;  and  (iii)  strengthened  local \nauthority capacity to improve revenue collection. Governance, including capacity development \nand gender mainstreaming, which are crosscutting themes in ADB\u2019s strategy, is included in the \nproject design. \n \n                                                \n15 Amendments  are  being  considered  to  the  Municipal  Councils  Ordinance,  Urban  Councils  Ordinance,  and \nPradeshiya  Sabhas Act. \n16 This process has been supported by the project preparatory TA, Sector Development Plan: Local Government \nDevelopment Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2010.

The impact of the project will be local authorities\u2019 capacity financially and technically \nstrengthened in less-developed areas of seven provinces in Sri Lanka, and the outcome of the \nproject  will  be  improved  local  infrastructure  and  services  delivered  effectively  by  local \nauthorities.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  less-developed  areas  in  seven  provinces, \nexcluding the Northern and Eastern provinces. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The project will have the following outputs. \n \n13.  Output  1:  Improved  local  infrastructure  and  basic  services  delivery.  In  this \ncomponent, social and economic infrastructure in less-developed areas will be improved by \nparticipating local authorities, in line with the second pillar of the sector development plan. The \nproject will adopt a bottom\u2013up, demand-driven approach, whereby priority subprojects will be \nidentified, proposed, implemented, and managed by local authorities. About 100 pradeshiya \nsabhas selected by the government will first have to submit a reform plan approved through a \ncouncil resolution, which will be reviewed and confirmed by the MLGPC in consultation with the \nprovincial councils to ensure that the minimum reform requirements are met (footnote 10). Then \nthey will be qualified for the provision of a capital grant under this component for infrastructure \nimprovement. Each reform plan will present the clear commitment of the local authority to (i) \nimprove service delivery with particular emphasis on the local environmental improvement; (ii) \nstreamline taxation, licensing, and approval systems and processes;19 (iii) ensure the effective \nmanagement of the assets, including those to be created under the project; and (iv) improve \nsystems and management. The implementation of each reform plan will be closely monitored by \nthe project management unit (PMU) in the MLGPC and subproject coordination units (SPCUs) \nin provincial councils. The successful implementation of reforms under such reform plans is a \nkey factor in determining budgetary support for local authorities. \n \n14.  Eligible subprojects include (i) environmental infrastructure such as water supply and \nsanitation  (including  sewerage),  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management;  (ii)  economic \ninfrastructure  such  as  roads  and  bridges  (including  suspension  bridges);  (iii)  public  health \ninfrastructure such as maternity and health-care centers; and (iv) other local authority facilities \nsuch  as  public  markets.  To  strengthen  the  focus  of  the  project,  other  facilities  under  the \nresponsibility  of  local  authorities,  such  as  local  authority  office  buildings,  libraries,  and \ncrematoriums,  are  generally  not  accepted  and  may  be  approved  only  under  special \ncircumstances and if clearly justified. Subprojects will be screened initially by the SPCUs to \nensure  conformity  with  the  provincial  physical  development  plan  and  subproject  selection \ncriteria before they will be endorsed by the PMU.20 The PMU will engage several teams of \ndesign and supervision consultants to ensure the quality of work. \n \n15.  Output 2: Local government policy reform and capacity building support. This \ncomponent will assist the implementation of the first pillar of the sector development plan \n(reform  advancement) by  supporting  (i)  local authorities\u2019  institutionalizing  business  process \nreengineering, including the implementation of relevant bylaws and regulations, with capacity \ndevelopment  support  provided  to the  local  authorities,21 and  (ii) the  development  of an IT \n                                                \n19 (i) Assessment and business taxes and the collection of rental fees, (ii) business and trade licensing, and (iii) \npermits for constructing buildings and land transactions. \n20 Subproject Selection Criteria (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 This initiative is linked with the development of more accountable revenue management in the central government \nthrough the establishment of a revenue administration management information system for the Inland Revenue \nDepartment in the Ministry of Finance and Planning, financed by ADB (ADB. 2010.

Analytical  and  implementation  support  will  be \nprovided through capacity development TA (para. 20). Implementation performance  will be \nevaluated under the project and be the basis for the government\u2019s decisions on scaling up \nfurther assistance. \n \n16.  Output 3: Project management and administration support. This component will \nsupport the smooth and effective implementation and operation of the project. The PMU in the \nMLGPC will manage project implementation, supported by the project management consultant. \nThe SPCU in each province will coordinate and supervise all project activities, including the \nimplementation of subprojects and reform plans in local authorities under their jurisdiction. \nTraining  programs  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  provincial  and  local \ngovernments to effectively plan development and efficiently administer local development. \n \nD.

The main \nactivities will be (i) proposing business process reengineering through a review of current tax, \nlicensing, and approval systems and processes in local authorities; (ii) drafting bylaws and \nregulations governing local governments to support business process reengineering; and (iii) \nsupporting the preparation and implementation of IT system development in local authorities. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $640,000 equivalent, of which $540,000 equivalent will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will \nfinance the remaining $100,000 equivalent. The executing agency for the TA is the MLGPC. \nThe TA will undertake the analytical work and help develop institutional capacity to implement \ncomponent 2 of the project.24 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n \n21.  Feasibility studies of sample subprojects undertaken in Kolonna and Neluwa pradeshiya \nsabhas during project preparation confirmed technical viability, with due consideration of local \ncapacity to undertake operation and maintenance (O&M). Complex water supply subprojects \nthat go beyond the capacity of local authorities will not be implemented under the project. \nTechnology  selection  prioritizes  the  least-cost  option,  taking  into  account  O&M  costs,  for \nnonrevenue-generating subprojects, and training will be carried out as necessary to ensure local \nauthorities\u2019 sustainable operation of subproject outputs. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Public  investment  under  the  project  is  justified  because  (i)  natural  monopolies  are \ninvolved (e.g., piped water supply and sewerage); (ii) services and benefits are public goods \n(e.g., roads and drainage); and (iii) integrated and coordinated management is required. The \ninfrastructure to be developed under the project is to meet the basic needs of citizens in \nparticipating local authorities. The economic analysis of subprojects was conducted for three \nsample subprojects in water supply, roads, and solid waste management. Estimates of the \neconomic internal rate of return of sample subprojects range from 17.1% to 22.7%, indicating \nsufficiently high economic return. The results are most sensitive to reduced benefits but robust \nagainst other downside risks, including increased capital cost, increased O&M cost, and delay in \nproject implementation. Moreover, underestimation of the economic returns is likely because the \nsubprojects have benefits that are not easily captured in numerical values.  \n \n23.  Some subprojects such as roads and drainage improvement do not generate cash \nrevenues, while others, including water supply and public markets, generate cash revenues. \nTherefore, financial analysis was conducted for two sample subprojects in water supply and \npublic markets. The financial internal rates of return were estimated at 3.4% for the water supply \nsubproject and 12.1% for the public market subproject, which compared favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital, estimated at 0.9%. For nonrevenue-generating subprojects, \nthe analysis focused on local authorities\u2019 financial capacity to meet the recurrent costs required \nto operate and maintain the developed physical assets in a sustainable manner. The projected \nfinancial position of sample local authorities confirmed their financial capacity to meet O&M \ncosts and other requirements to sustain service delivery. When the PMU reviews the subproject \nrequests from local authorities, it will assess the capacity and commitment of local authorities to \nallocate adequate O&M budget to sustain service delivery. \n \n                                                \n24 Capacity Development Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8          \nC.  Governance \n24.  An assessment of financial management and procurement capacity undertaken during \nproject  preparation  indicates  that  the  MLGPC  can  manage  loan  proceeds  for  project \nimplementation.  The  PMU  and  the  SPCUs  have  experience  in  financial  management  and \nprocurement in accordance with ADB requirements and have a satisfactory track record from \nthe LGIIP. Procurement for civil works and equipment will be handled at the provincial level to \nreduce procurement risks, as SPCUs have higher capacity and more experience than local \nauthorities. Transparency in procurement, financing, and other matters will be maximized under \nthe project through such measures as the PMU\u2019s developing a project website to disclose \ninformation  on  the  project  to  reduce  corruption  risk  and  improve  governance.  Each  local \nauthority\u2019s preparation and implementation of the reform plan, which includes strengthening \nfinancial discipline and enhancing citizens\u2019 participation in the local authority\u2019s administrative \nmatters, will help improve the accountability of local authorities. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 23). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. While women in Sri Lanka \ngenerally have higher status than women in other developing countries in South Asia and \nelsewhere  in  terms  of  access  to  education  and  health-care  services,  many  women  are \ndisadvantaged  owing  to  poor  roads,  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  other  public  services, \nparticularly  in  less-developed  areas  of  the  country.  Limited  access  to  safe  drinking  water \nrequires household members, primarily women and children, to spend considerable time and \neffort on fetching water. Inadequate and poor-quality roads limit poor communities\u2019 access to \nmarkets, health-care centers, and schools and create safety and security issues for women and \ngirls. Subprojects identified in a participatory and inclusive manner will address the immediate \nneeds of communities, including women. A gender action plan will be implemented to ensure \ninclusiveness and address the different needs of women and vulnerable groups. By focusing its \nsupport  to  less-developed  areas  of the  country,  the  project  will  help  redress geographical \ninequality and contribute to balanced regional development. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  The project is category B for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  limit  negative  impacts  through  avoidance  and \nminimization. Subprojects will have positive environmental benefits, improving local authorities\u2019 \nenvironment and public health. Potential adverse environmental impacts are mostly related to \nconstruction and are temporary. No significant involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples \nimpacts are anticipated. \n \n28.  An environmental assessment and review framework, a resettlement framework, and an \nindigenous peoples planning framework have been prepared for the project.25 Consistent with \nthe safeguards frameworks, three initial environmental examinations were prepared for sample \nsubprojects.  They  include  environmental  management  plans  that  will  ensure  adequate \nmitigation of adverse environmental impacts. None of the sample subprojects has involuntary \nresettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  impacts.  The  project  improves  on  implementation \narrangements for the ongoing LGIIP and will further build the executing agency\u2019s capacity for \n                                                \n25 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, Resettlement Framework, and Indigenous Peoples Planning \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The executing agency will \nundertake  safeguard  due  diligence  on  subprojects  based  on  the  framework  documents \nprepared for the project and submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n29.  The safeguards frameworks and initial environmental examinations were developed in \nconsultation  with  stakeholders  and  disclosed  in  the  Kolonna  and  Neluwa  local  authorities. \nSafeguards documents were disclosed on the websites of ADB and the MLGPC. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.
