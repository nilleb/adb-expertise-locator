The proposed Skills Development Project (SDP) will support the Nepalese workforce, \nincluding excluded groups, to develop their skills for domestic and international employment. To \ndesign the project, a participatory process involving all the relevant stakeholders is necessary to \nseek consensus on the scope, coverage and priority reforms to be supported by the project. The \nparticipatory process will be informed by an analysis of the technical education and vocational \ntraining (TEVT) subsector including its position and linkages with the labor market and general \neducation  system.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  will  assist  the \nGovernment and other key stakeholders in analyzing and prioritizing reforms and improvements \nto make the TEVT system more responsive to the needs of labor market as well as excluded \ngroups Several initiatives, particularly the implementation of policy reforms supported by ADB\u201fs \nongoing Skills for Employment (SEP) and other projects, have to be sustained to consolidate \nand institutionalize them.  \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will (i) draw lessons learned from the ongoing projects and progress in TEVT \nsubsector; (ii) update the subsector analysis; (iii) update labor market information; (iv) conduct a \n\u201egap\u201f analysis; (v) identify economic sectors for demand oriented approach, with innovative \npartnership  arrangements;  (vi)  identify  strengthening  linkages  with  overseas  markets  (vii) \nidentify institutional development and capacity development requirements in line with policy \nreforms; (viii) analyze governance risks in the sector and the executing and implementing \nagencies, and identify mitigating actions; and (ix) help other due diligence of the project. These \ninputs will be fed into a new project design.  \n3.  The  PPTA  will  conduct  an  inception  workshop  at  the  initial  stage  to  inform  the \nstakeholders about the project preparation process and to agree on over direction of the new \nproject in the form of draft design and monitoring framework, which will be adjusted and revised \nbased on stakeholder feedback. The PPTA will conduct stakeholders\u201f workshops and focus-\ngroup discussions involving six types of stakeholders: (i) government policy makers and officials \ninvolved  in  implementation;  (ii)  private  sector  training  providers;  (iii)  teachers  and  teacher \nunions; (iv) students; (v) representatives from employers and employees; and (vi) academic and \nresearch institutions. \n4.  A major output of the TA will be a subsector analysis which can build on the previous \nanalysis undertaken for the SEP and other recent projects to show progress made in recent \nyears. The analysis will focus broadly on the organization of the TEVT subsector, institutional \narrangements,  basic  information  and  trends  on  students,  teachers,  TEVT  institutions,  and \nperformance  of  the  subsector  in  terms  of  equitable  access, quality  and  relevance,  overall \nresponsiveness of TEVT system to labor market needs, employability and reforms achieved. \nLessons learned from previous and ongoing projects, including SEP, will be included in the \nanalysis. A full update on the current functioning of the skills testing and its usage by TEVT \nproviders and its image and acceptance in the domestic and international labor market will be \nassessed. The PPTA will get a more detailed picture of the involvement of industry and other \nemployers in developing TEVT at national and international/regional level, both in the private \nand the public sector. The sector analysis will also include a policy and institutional analysis of \nthe TEVT subsector. The analysis is expected to review the by then approved policy framework \nand its consequences for the TEVT system and providers to meet Government priorities, and \nreview the broader policy reforms in general education, in higher education, the investment \nclimate and social security. Analysis of the role of overseas employment in the TEVT sector will \n ", "Appendix 4  11 \n \nbe included. The subsector analysis will also draw from the findings of the ongoing regional \ntechnical assistance that covers TEVT, good practices and lessons learned from national and \ninternational experiences (particularly from Sri Lanka, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, South \nKorea) and experiences from within Nepal in PPP, market responsiveness and other good \npractices. \n5.  Another output of the PPTA is an analysis of the labor market to ascertain which skills \nare in demand, which courses are popular, the background of the TEVT students and the nature \nof underemployment, the overseas employment, and the skills shortage. This also includes an \nanalysis of the social demand for the TEVT courses and their image, and the employability of \ngraduates from different types of TEVT institutions and courses be it self-employment, informal \nemployment, domestic employment or international employment. The analysis will also provide \na wider view on the functioning of the labor market and identify any structural and or cultural \nbarriers to employability or mismatch between supply and demand of skills. The analysis will \nlook into prevailing gender patterns in the labor market to inform strategies for the project to \nrespond to gender labor market segregation and provide women and men with wider range of \ndecent employment choices through appropriate skills training to meet market needs. Based on \nthis analysis the existing capacity to conduct labor market analysis will be assessed, and \ncapacity and reforms for strengthened labor market analysis identified. \n6.  Based on the subsector analysis, including the lessons learned from SEP and other \nprojects, and the labor market analysis, the PPTA will conduct an analysis of the requirement for \nshort term training targeted at unskilled people and the trainings provided by ongoing projects \nand programs, specifically the Employment Fund and the World Bank\u201fs Skills Development \nproject. This analysis is the basis for the type and scope of the short term trainings, and post \ntraining support for (self)employment and micro-credit, to be incorporated in the SDP. \n7.  The PPTA will identify economic sectors most suitable for a more demand oriented \napproach  for  providing  skills  development.  Possible  employment  opportunities  created  for \ndifferent groups with different skills levels to strengthen the value chain in these sectors is part \nof this analysis and identification. This includes identifying potential linkages with overseas \nmarkets and identifying PPP opportunities for skills development in these sectors. In several \nsectors the private sector and other employers are well organized and are already providing \nskills training, like tourism, construction, and power. During the identification these initiatives will \nbe further studied and options for further partnership developed. Partnerships can embrace \nmajor national and possibly international employers, who could be involved in the design of the \ntraining curriculum, and in industrial attachments. There will be performance\u2013based contracts \navailable  to  the  private  sector,  and  to  public-private  partnerships,  for  piloting  innovative \n(including non-institutional) delivery modalities such as flexible approaches to apprenticeships \nand apprenticeship management, the implementation of workplace arrangements to recognize \nprior learning, or current competencies, acquired through informal learning (and providing gap-\nfilling training as required), and also for structured workplace skills acquisition leading to formal \nassessment and certification. Where appropriate, these PPPs will include involvement from \nmicro-service credit providers to help interested participants in training programs to access \ncredit to start their own small businesses. After identification of the first economic sector, a \nspecialist for this sector will be recruited to assist the PPTA-team. \n8.  The PPTA will identify institutional development and capacity development requirements \nin line with policy reforms. These will focus on requirements in the TEVT sector, especially with \nan expected shift in the role of the government. The government will focus more on facilitation \nand regulation, while autonomous bodies, universities and other institutions, and the private \nsector will focus more on service delivery  in  PPP arrangements. The exact nature of the \nrequirements will depend on the approved policy framework. Analysis of the required capacity to \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n \ndevelop and implement the NVQF and related skills testing, to develop and implement the \nTEVT-fund board, and its relation with existing funds like the Employment Fund and proposed \nfunds like the social security fund, and to develop the public and private providers, including a \nprivate training providers association, is part of this exercise. Ensuring that no duplication will \noccur  requires  an  overview  of  the  support  provided  and  planned  by  other  projects  and \ndevelopment partners in these areas. The requirement will also focus on the position of the \nTEVT-sector in the education sector and in its linkages with the economic development. Labor \nmarket information analysis is one of the core requirements.  \n9.  The PPTA will analyze governance (PFM, procurement and corruption), and institutional \nrisks in the sector and the executing and implementing agencies, and identify mitigating actions. \nThe PPTA will update the economic and financial analysis undertaken for SEP, with special \nfocus on sustainability, alternatives considered, economic internal rate of return, and poverty \nanalysis. Finally, the PPTA will help the Government to formulate the Project for review by the \nGovernment and ADB. In doing this, the TA will also ensure social analysis and safeguards \nissues. Given the limited knowledge about the impact of current TEVT interventions an impact \nanalysis will be part of the Project. It is crucial that the design is the result of a participatory \nprocess.

Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Ministry of Education will be the executing agency (EA) for the PPTA. A PPTA \nsteering committee will be established with the secretary of MoE as the chairperson, and with \nrepresentatives from Ministry of Finance, Planning Commission, CTEVT, Ministry of Labor, \nMinistry of Industry, Ministry of Tourism, and representation from the private sector via the \nFederation of Nepal Chambers of Commerce and Industries and the Confederation of Nepal \nIndustries, to ensure coordination with concerned departments and institutions and to provide \noverall guidance to the PPTA on policies and reforms. A technical committee with experts from \nthe key stakeholders, under guidance from the CTEVT, will be established to guide technical \naspects of the design. While the steering committee will meet 2-3 times during the PPTA \nimplementation, the technical committee will meet regularly to guide and monitor progress and \nensure effective design of the SDP. \n \n14.
