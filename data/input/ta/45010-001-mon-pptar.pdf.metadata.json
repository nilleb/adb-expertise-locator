Justification \n1.  With a view to improving the employability of technical and vocational education and \ntraining (TVET) graduates in priority sectors of the economy, the proposed project will address \nthe following issues: (i) ongoing TVET policy development which has been slowed down by the \nrecent government restructuring; (ii) lack of a skills development strategy to implement key \ndevelopment policies of the government; (iii) insufficient employer and industry engagement in \nTVET policy development and implementation; (iv) underinvestment in training and professional \ndevelopment  of  TVET  teachers  and  managers;  and  (v)  students\u2019  lack  of  preparedness, \ntrainability,  and  career  information  in  secondary  and  special  education  schools.  Although \nsignificant investments have been made in the TVET sector in recent years with the support of \ndevelopment partners and the private sector, those issues have not sufficiently been addressed \nin  part  for  lack  of  detailed  and  focused  analyses,  and  coordinated  efforts.  Given  the \ncircumstances,  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA),  approved  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan  on  22  November  2012  using  the  title  \u201cReforms  in  Technical  and \nVocational Education and Training in Mongolia,\u201d will perform in-depth analyses of the labor \nmarket, TVET policies and delivery systems, TVET teacher polices and training programs, \npartnership arrangements between TVET providers and employer/industry, and interests and \ncapacity  of  secondary  and  special  education  schools  to  undertake  pre-vocational  training \nprograms  and  will  recommend  policy  and  project  design  and  operating  procedures  in \npreparation for the proposed project.
