THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of the Philippines  for subprogram 2 of the Inclusive Finance \nDevelopment Program, and (ii) the proposed inclusion of subprogram 3 in the programmatic \napproach.1 \n \n2.  The program directly supports  reforms included  in the Philippine  Development Plan \n2017\u20132022 and will increase financial inclusion by (i) strengthening the institutional and policy \n \nenvironment, (ii) improving financial infrastructure, and (iii) increasing the capacity and reach of \nfinancial service providers. The program contributes to Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) by addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating progress in \ngender equality, promoting rural development and food security, strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity,2 and enhancing climate resilience through financial inclusion (table).3 The \nprogram is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132023 for the Philippines, in \nwhich financial inclusion is included under the third strategic pillar on investing in people. The \nprogram  is  also  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country operations  business  plan,  2020\u20132022  for the \nPhilippines.4 While the reforms were underway well before the onset of the current coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic, the measures under subprogram 3 will facilitate the economic \nrecovery process in the Philippines. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The programmatic approach and budget support. The program uses a programmatic \napproach that aligns ADB assistance with key government reform programs over the medium-to-\nlong term, to support increased access to financial products and services as part of an inclusive \neconomic growth agenda. In October 2018, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the programmatic \napproach and a $300 million loan for subprogram 1.5 Through 14 policy actions, subprogram 1 \nhelped the government prepare to increase the safe use of financial services and scale-up the \ndelivery of financial services, especially through digital channels. Through 15 policy actions, \nsubprogram 2 builds on the policy reforms under subprogram 1 by implementing a national \nidentity system, continuing to test new initiatives in agriculture finance including insurance, further \nstrengthening  financial  consumer  protection  and  literacy,  expanding  digital  finance,  and \nsupporting further innovation and capacity development among financial service providers. \n \n4.  The program was originally designed to have two subprograms. Considering the ambitious \ntargets set by the government to considerably increase financial inclusion by 2023, the complex \nnature of the remaining and upcoming reforms, and the need to sustain progress of such reforms, \nthe government has requested further support from ADB through subprogram 3, for an indicative \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Manila. ", "2 \namount of $300 million. While supporting COVID-19 recovery efforts, subprogram 3 will continue \nsupport for the government's ongoing inclusive finance agenda by leveraging the national identity \nsystem to expand financial inclusion, building on the growing digital payment ecosystem, further \nincreasing the capacity of financial service providers through their digital transformation, and \nsupporting reforms to reduce inequalities in women\u2019s access to finance and to promote women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment.  \n \n5.  The development problem. The Philippine economy grew at an average rate of 6.3% \nper year during 2010\u20132019, up from 4.5% during 2000\u20132009 and 3.0% in the 1990s.6 A total of \n1.4 million jobs for wage-earners and salaried employees were added in 2019, reducing the \nunemployment rate from 5.3% in 2018 to 5.1% in 2019. Important policy reforms\u2014including the \npassage of the 2019 Universal Health Care Law and social protection reforms\u2014aim to reduce \ninequalities in household income. However, the impact of the COVID-19 could erase these gains. \nGross domestic product (GDP) is expected to contract by 3.8% in 2020,  accompanied by \nincreased unemployment.7 In Luzon alone, job losses are expected to reach 4.3 million in the \nsecond quarter of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has also amplified poverty as a development \nchallenge. While the poverty rate fell from 23.3% in 2015 to 16.7% in 2018, given the significant \njob and income losses resulting from the pandemic, ADB estimates suggest that an additional 5.5 \nmillion Filipinos will fall into poverty, with poverty incidence rising to 20.7% in 2020.8 \n \n6.  Financial inclusion remains low by regional comparison, but with some gains. \nAccording to the Global Findex Survey 2017 (the most recent available), the Philippines had one \nof the lowest rankings in Southeast Asia for almost all financial inclusion indicators. Only 34% of \nFilipino adults have an account at a formal financial institution, compared with 49% of adults in \nIndonesia, 82% in Thailand, and 85% in Malaysia. From 2014 to 2017 the proportion of the \npopulation  that  borrowed from a formal financial institution  fell from 12% to 10%,  and the \nproportion that saved at a formal financial institution declined from 15% to 12%. Lower-income \nhouseholds were disproportionally excluded\u2014in 2017 only 18% of the poorest 40% (by income) \nhad an account.9 To address these low figures, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), with ADB \nsupport under subprogram 1 and subprogram 2, has taken steps to make it easier to open new \naccounts, strengthened the focus on digital financial inclusion, and pushed for digital payments. \nAs a result, financial inclusion as captured under several key metrics has improved. According to \nthe BSP's quarterly financial inclusion dashboard as of the fourth quarter of 2019, since the \nissuance of the policy allowing basic deposit accounts (BDA) in 2018, 119 banks have offered \nBDAs to 4 million depositors amounting to \u20b13.5 billion ($70 million equivalent).10 The number of \ne-money wallets has grown exponentially, from 5 million in 2018 to 8.8 million in 2019 representing \n74% year-on-year growth. Further, the number of cities and municipalities without a banking \npresence declined from 35.6% as of the end of December 2016 to 31.8% in 2019.  \n \n7.  Other important indicators of financial inclusion have stagnated or declined. Year-\non-year growth of loans to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) declined by 12% \nduring 2018\u20132019, primarily because of a tightening of credit standards. While the gender gap in \nfinancial inclusion in the Philippines continues to favor women\u201439% of women hold accounts \ncompared to 30% of men, and 61% of women save through formal and informal channels \n \n6  ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n ", "3 \ncompared to  57%  of  men\u2014the  lack of sex-disaggregated  data  in  other  areas,  including \nentrepreneurship, makes other gender gaps less visible. More nuanced data is required, notably \nin terms of digital financial literacy and access to credit. Over the medium term, actions to mitigate \nclimate change, which is  among the  greatest  threats  to  sustainable  development, poverty \nreduction,  and  financial  stability  including  financial  inclusion,  will  be  critically important. 11 \nExpanding financial services across the country, especially in regions with the highest levels of \npoverty and areas that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, is crucial to achieving the \ngovernment\u2019s agenda of promoting inclusive growth.12 \n \n8.  The COVID-19 pandemic adds to the complexity of addressing barriers to financial \ninclusion. The widespread loss of income and rapid increase in poverty resulting from COVID-19 \nin the midst of various community quarantine measures call for even greater efforts to achieve \nfinancial  inclusion.  Focusing  on  the  poorest  40%  of the  population  is  particularly  urgent. \nCOVID-19 emergency subsidies  exposed  challenges  in  ensuring  timely provision  of  social \nassistance and financial inclusion, as many of the non-Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program \n(4Ps) families were not identifiable from national databases, and most lacked deposit accounts to \nfacilitate expedient and efficient transfers.13 Timely implementation of the national identification \nsystem with linkages to the finance sector is needed to improve access to social services by the \n \npoor.\n \n9.  Binding constraints. The government has recognized the challenges and has identified \nthree primary constraints to financial inclusion: (i) structural impediments which limit access to \nfinance, especially for the rural poor; (ii) fragmented financial infrastructure which does not provide \nan enabling environment; and (iii) limited capacity of financial institutions to expand outreach and \nincrease access to finance.14 \n \n10.  Structural impediments that limit access to finance. While the Philippine Identification \nSystem (PhilSys) has been approved, implementation has required a long lead time to ensure \nthat the system is robust, secure, and inter-operable. Further, PhilSys\u2019s linkages to the finance \nsector, credit reporting  system, and overall  payment infrastructure have yet to be formally \nestablished.  In addition,  agriculture finance remains underdeveloped  and underutilized,  with \nclimate change-related  risks  exacerbating  these  weaknesses.  To  better  understand  these \nweaknesses, the BSP introduced a program for rural and thrift banks to increase agriculture value \nchain finance (AVCF) and pilot test new approaches.15 While crop insurance is available from a \nsole government provider, it fails to meet the risk protection needs of the estimated 10.26 million \nfarmers and producers.16 Finally,  additional  targeted  financial literacy activities  need to  be \ndesigned for poor households and MSMEs, particularly those led by women. \n \n11.

Sustainable Finance Towards a Climate-Resilient Philippine \nEconomy. 21 November. \n16 The Philippines Crop Insurance Corporation, an agency attached to the Department of Agriculture, is mandated by \nlaw to provide insurance protection to the country\u2019s agricultural producers, particularly subsistence farmers. \n ", "4 \npayments, support the financial inclusion of small businesses and poor individuals. However, \nachieving higher levels of financial intermediation also depends on the ability of lenders to assess \ncredit risks and to compensate with collateral if necessary. Collateral registries enable businesses \nto access credit more affordably and allow financial institutions  to reduce their lending risk. \nLegislation  was passed  in 2008 to establish  a comprehensive credit reporting  registry,  but \nawareness of the system is limited, which reduces participation among financial service providers. \nFurther implementation of the 2008 law will also help address the lack of credit data and support \nbank lending, especially to MSMEs. These processes will also support women\u2019s access to credit \nby overcoming barriers associated with the gender gaps in asset and land ownership. Likewise, \nstrengthening the government\u2019s credit guarantee system will help to better meet the needs of \nMSMEs, particularly those engaged in agriculture. \n \n12.  Limited capacity of financial institutions. Traditional financial service providers have \nlimited capacity to reach the underbanked and those excluded from financial services, including \nwomen. Rural banks, which are best placed to reach MSMEs and agricultural enterprises in rural \nareas,  have  limited  financial  and  operational  capacity.  Microfinance  nongovernmental \norganizations (MNGOs) reach the largest numbers of microenterprises and low-income clients \nbut given the current regulatory structure\u2014where MNGOs are monitored and accredited based \non  financial, social,  and  governance  performance standards\u2014only  30  MNGOs have  been \naccredited. While recent reforms encourage financial institutions to develop their capacity through \ndigital transformation, reducing operating costs and reaching clients more effectively with a wider \nrange of products and services, most financial institutions lack the resources or ability to innovate. \nInnovation  that employs  women-friendly financial products  and services  and enables  more \nwomen to access finance remains limited. Finally, following the adoption of a legal and regulatory \nframework for Islamic finance, financial institutions  need support to develop client-responsive \nIslamic Financial Services that can support inclusion for a large segment of the population, \nparticularly in conflict-affected regions of the country such as Mindanao. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n13.  The government\u2019s reform agenda. The government\u2019s National Strategy for Financial \nInclusion  (NSFI) coordinates  broad-based  initiatives  for greater  financial inclusion.  Its  key \nelements include digital finance, financial literacy, credit information systems, development of a \nmovable collateral  registry,  diversification  of financial products  and  services, and  capacity \nstrengthening of MNGOs. The government institutionalized  the NSFI by establishing a steering \ncommittee, requiring line agencies to develop medium-term work plans to achieve NSFI targets, \nand developing a monitoring and evaluation framework. The committee comprises 13 government \nagencies,  private  sector  institutions,  and  development  partners.  The  BSP  serves  as  the \nsecretariat responsible for monitoring and coordinating NSFI implementation. The committee\u2019s \nmost recent priority areas of focus have included agriculture finance and digital payments. As a \nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has announced 12 areas for structural reforms \nduring 2021\u20132023, including financial inclusion. The government aims to ensure that every head \nof household from the poorest sector has at least one bank account. To help achieve this target, \nthe government will prioritize accelerating PhilSys registration of 5 million low-income household \nheads by December 2020. \n \n14.  Programmatic approach. The program consists of three reform areas that support the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to increase financial inclusion. It contains high-impact policy actions  to \nsupport the implementation of the NSFI to (i) strengthen the institutional and policy environment \nfor financial inclusion, (ii) strengthen the infrastructure for financial inclusion, and (iii) increase the \ncapacity of service providers with a focus on rural banks and nonbank financial institutions. The \n ", "5 \ngovernment completed 15 policy reforms comprising 8 prior actions and 7 policy milestones. The \nprogram supports several Sustainable Development Goals and is aligned with key operational \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (footnote 2), as shown in the table. Four policy actions exceeded \nexpectations and were strengthened to reflect stronger achievements. For example, to increase \nthe share of digital payments to total transactions, the BSP introduced a National Quick Response \nCode Standard for payments, promoted payment of salaries  through  formal accounts, and \ndigitized payments in public transportation. Under subprogram 2, at the request of the government, \ntwo policy actions were added to reflect (i) the financial consumer protection policy reforms \nintroduced by the government and (ii) the steps taken to strengthen and diversify the NSFI, with \nthe Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) participating in its implementation.17 \n \nAlignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priority  Program \nAddressing remaining  The program supports financial literacy and extends affordable formal \npoverty and reducing  financial services to the poor and rural microenterprises, which have a \ninequalities  direct impact on poverty reduction. \nAccelerating progress in  The program supports approaches that address prevailing gender \ngender equality  inequalities in women\u2019s access to finance and support women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment.  \nPromoting rural development  The program supports the government in strengthening agriculture \nand food security  value chain finance and agriculture insurance through \nintergovernmental dialogue, pilot testing of new approaches, \ndevelopment of tools to help mitigate risk and scale outreach, and \npolicy reforms. \nTackling climate change,  The program supports policies that directly and indirectly help to \nbuilding climate and disaster  increase the climate and disaster resilience of individuals and micro, \nresilience, and enhancing  small, and medium-sized enterprises throughout the country, especially \nenvironmental sustainability  in the priority areas that are particularly vulnerable. These priority areas \ninclude provinces with a high concentration of poor and marginalized \nfarmers, fisherfolk, traders, drivers, and workers, who have limited \naccess to credit from formal financial institutions and are at high risk to \nclimate extreme events.a \nStrengthening governance  The program helps strengthen regulatory and supervisory bodies \nand institutional capacity  responsible for overseeing a range of different types of financial service \nproviders including rural banks and microfinance nongovernmental \norganizations.  \na  Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.  Reform  area  1:  Institutional  and  policy  environment  for  financial  inclusion \nstrengthened. This reform area builds on the government\u2019s introduction of institutional reforms \nacross the financial sector to improve access to finance for low-income households and MSMEs. \nUnder subprogram  2,  the  Philippine  Statistics  Authority:  (i) issued  implementing  rules  and \nregulations  to  guide  implementation  of  the  PhilSys,  which  include  provisions  to  facilitate \nregistration of children, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities;  (ii) issued procurement \npackages that constitute major  system implementation milestones; (iii) began pilot testing of the \nregistration process; (iv) developed a monitoring and evaluation framework; and (v) developed a \nstrategy for linking the national identification to increased financial inclusion. A well-functioning \nPhilSys will be critical to the implementation and integrity of social assistance programs similar to \n \n17 Further elaboration on the strengthened actions and additional actions taken by the government as compared to the \noriginal subprogram 2 indicative reforms, is provided in Comparison of Original and Revised Reforms under \nSubprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nthose under  the country\u2019s COVID-19 response  program.18 To support expanded agriculture \nfinance including for enterprises owned by women and better inform policymakers, the BSP \nhelped develop the AVCF framework through a pilot program for rural and thrift banks to increase \nlending to individuals and businesses in the value chain.  \n \n16.  The Insurance Commission developed guidelines  for distribution channels that deliver \nmicroinsurance products to clients. It also supported a regulatory sandbox approach for a public\u2013\nprivate partnership (PPP) pilot to expand the coverage of agriculture insurance involving the \nPhilippine Crop Insurance Corporation and private insurance companies. To further increase \nnationwide  financial  literacy, the  BSP developed  strategic  partnerships,  including  with  the \nDepartment of Education.19 The BSP also strengthened financial consumer protection by issuing \nregulations to promote access to high-quality financial services, drafting a financial consumer \nprotection law, and developing a Chatbot using artificial intelligence to provide a more efficient \nand  accessible  way to  reach the  BSP on  consumer protection  matters.  Finally,  the  BSP \nstrengthened the NSFI\u2019s gender-responsive policies and actions by endorsing the membership of \nthe PCW in the NSFI steering committee and establishing a project steering committee to oversee \nthe design of the first comprehensive national MSME survey with a gender focus. With ADB \nsupport, the BSP led a national stakeholder workshop that helped define the survey framework \nand provided a venue to discuss key issues related to women\u2019s entrepreneurship. This MSME \nsurvey complements the enterprise survey conducted by the Department of Finance (DOF) in \ncollaboration with ADB to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on MSMEs in the Philippines, \nincluding enterprises owned and/or led by women. \n \n17.  Under subprogram 3, the government will: (i) continue to implement PhilSys and link this \nto financial inclusion, beginning with 5 million low-income household heads by December 2020 \nand reaching at least 50 million persons by 2022; (ii) further strengthen AVCF by using lessons \nfrom the pilot program to help expand support to other financial institutions; and (iii) pursue further \nreforms that support women\u2019s financial inclusion and entrepreneurship based on the national \nMSME survey with a gender focus. Adoption of a robust monitoring and evaluation framework for \nthe NSFI and a gender impact assessment will support an updated NSFI action plan with gender-\nfocused targets and the establishment of a national taskforce on MSMEs owned and/or led by \nwomen.  The  program  will  expand  the  PPP  for  agriculture  insurance,  simplify  insurance \ninstruments to enhance access of marginalized sectors, and build on key partnerships to expand \nfinancial literacy and financial consumer protection without discrimination.20 \n \n18.  Reform area 2: Infrastructure for financial inclusion strengthened. This reform area \nbuilds on the government\u2019s efforts under subprogram 1 to improve the national retail payment \nsystem, launch a national credit registry, establish a moveable collateral registry, and reform \ncredit guarantee schemes. Under subprogram 2, the BSP continued to enhance the national retail \npayment system and support the expansion of digital payments. The number of basic deposit \naccounts was increased through: (i) the issuance of guidelines for ensuring interoperability of \n \n18 Signed into law on 24 March 2020, the Bayan Bayanihan to Heal as One Act includes a \u20b1205 billion Social \nAmelioration Program, a cash emergency subsidy program to ensure income and food security for up to 18 million \nfamilies (4P and non-4P) adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n19 Through the partnership, the Department of Education incorporated financial literacy in the K to 12 Basic Education \nProgram (policy finalization, development of curriculum exemplars, and a monitoring and evaluation framework \n[disaggregated by sex] to assess the financial literacy of teachers and students covering 47,000 public schools, \n800,000 teachers, and 29 million learners).   \n20 The Magna Carta of Women mandates government agencies to \u201cenhance access of women entrepreneurs/potential \nentrepreneurs to credit and capital through, among others, simplified insurance instrument through contract \nstandardization.\u201d (Republic Act 9710. Sec. 26 (D). \n ", "7 \nrapid response-enabled payment and financial services; (ii) a partnership with the Department of \nLabor and Employment to promote payment of salaries through formal accounts and the digitizing \nof payments in public transportation; and (iii) the issuance of guidelines and standards to further \nextend the reach of a range of financial services, including cash agents and branch-lite units to \nallow approved  banks  to act as  a  microinsurance agent  or broker.21 To increase financial \nconsumer protection and expand the credit history of low-income clients, the Microfinance NGO \nRegulatory Council (MNRC) required accredited MNGOs to report to the Credit Information \nCorporation  (CIC), which  will  expand  the  coverage of credit  information.  In  addition,  the \nCooperative Development Authority issued regulations requiring all borrowers to submit basic \ncredit data to the CIC. The Personal Property Security Act was signed into law in August 2018, \nand the Implementing Rules and Regulations for the Act were issued in October 2019 to support \nthe development of a centralized and nationwide electronic collateral registry. Finally, to improve \nMSME access to more affordable credit and enable financial institutions to lower their lending risk, \nthe government streamlined credit enhancement mechanisms by consolidating and recapitalizing \nall its guarantee programs under  the Philippine Guarantee Corporation (PhilGuarantee), and \nsubsequently approving a restructuring plan. \n \n19.  Under  subprogram  3, the  government  will  build  on  the  payments  infrastructure by \npromoting use of the national quick response code standard and increasing the use of digital \nchannels for government payments, including expansion of payment channels to support the \ngovernment's social protection programs. The government will provide licenses to more cash \nagents and increase financial literacy outreach to include gender-focused digital financial literacy \nstrategies. Additional reforms will increase the coverage of the credit reporting system to expand \ncredit histories of clients and MSMEs and establish linkages to PhilSys. The Land Registration \nAuthority will increase awareness and use of the online collateral registry, and PhilGuarantee will \nexpand the number of MSMEs supported through state-financed guarantee-backed lending by \n10%, with a dedicated target for MSMEs owned and/or led by women. \n \n20.  Reform area 3: Capacity of financial service providers increased. This reform area \naims to improve the capacity of MNGOs and rural banks, and to expand their reach. First, the \nMNRC accredited and monitored the compliance of MNGOs. The MNRC also provided training \nprograms to help build their capacity for compliance by (i) adapting the internal information \ntechnology systems of the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for collecting sex-\ndisaggregated data covering boards of trustees, management personnel, and client borrowers of \nMNGOs, and (ii) designing a training program that will help the MNRC and MNGOs to comply \nwith MNRC accreditation and CIC requirements, starting with the development of a supervision \nmanual for MNGOs, pilot testing, and onsite training. As of March 2020, all 30 accredited MNGOs \nhave women on their boards. Second, to further develop the capacity of rural banks, the BSP \nenabled  the  safe  use  of  cloud-based  core  banking  technology  by  issuing  guidelines  on \ncybersecurity and cloud computing, and authorized 26 rural and thrift banks to use a cloud-based \nsystem.22 Third, with the passage of the Islamic Banking Act, the BSP issued implementing rules \non  the  licensing  Islamic  banks,  establishment  of  Islamic  banking  windows,  and  Shari\u2019ah \ngovernance principles. \n \n \n21 The BSP circulars and guidelines issued in 2018 and 2020 provide a framework for offering of basic deposit accounts \nand allowing banks to contract third party entities as cash agents. A branch-lite unit refers to any permanent office \nor place of business of a bank, other than its head office or a branch. A branch-lite unit performs limited banking \n \nactivities and records its transactions in the books of the head office or branch.\n22 Based on the results of the pilot supported under subprogram 1, the BSP issued non-objections for 25 rural banks to \noperate using cloud-based core banking systems. \n ", "8 \n21.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  MNRC will  continue  to  improve  its  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated data and its conduct of onsite supervisory examinations of MNGOs. The BSP will \ncontinue to support the use of financial technology innovations through a regulatory sandbox \napproach, application of regulation technology solutions, and innovations that specifically address \nMSMEs led by women who are unserved or underserved because of constraints in access to \nfinancial services from formal financial institutions.  Finally, the government will take steps to \nincrease the availability of Islamic financial services through awareness-raising  and capacity-\ndevelopment activities, with special consideration for women and enterprises owned by women. \n \n22.  ADB experience. Starting with the Rural Microenterprise Finance Project in 1996, ADB \nhas worked closely with the government to establish a foundation for successful microfinance \nwholesale lending  operations and  to contribute to the growth of microfinance.23 Subsequent \nprograms, such as the Microfinance Development Program helped to strengthen regulatory and \nsupervisory capacity and carried out a national microfinance literacy program.24 ADB further \nsupported the development of the sector with the Developing Financial Cooperatives Project, \nwhich  improved the  regulatory  environment  for credit  and  savings  cooperatives,  and  the \nDeveloping Microinsurance Project, which helped the government set up a suitable regulatory \nenvironment and launch the National Strategy for Microinsurance in 2010.25 These programs \nprovided a conducive regulatory framework that allowed financial inclusion. Approval of the \nprogram in October 2018 provided support to address persistent constraints to increased financial \ninclusion (footnote 5). \n \n23.  Lessons. Key lessons from ADB\u2019s long-term involvement in the development of a more \ninclusive finance sector provide valuable input to the program design and implementation.26 First, \na comprehensive strategy with high-level support, such as the NSFI, which address types and \naccessibility of products and services offered, infrastructure and payment system, and capacity \nof financial service providers is a prerequisite to effectively address the lack of access to financial \nservices. Second, to successfully implement reforms, government ownership  and widespread \npolitical will are necessary. Third, pilot projects that test new strategies through a regulatory \nsandbox approach are important for evidence-based policy development and building stakeholder \nsupport for institutional reforms. Fourth, reforms and capacity development should include close \nADB involvement, with national  and  local government ownership  and  development partner \nsupport.27  Fifth, financial inclusion becomes even more important in times of crisis to ensure that \nthe poor get access to social assistance. Without a national identification system linked to a \ndeposit  account,  the  government was  challenged  to  distribute  grants  through  the  Social \nAmelioration Program to the non-4P families (footnote 18) (box).  \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. The overall program \ndesign resulted from close engagement with implementing agencies. The program incorporates \nknowledge  gained  from  sustained  ADB  policy  dialogue  and  technical  assistance  (TA) \nimplementation. ADB has supported implementation of PhilSys in key areas by tapping TA and \n \n23 ADB. 1996.

Under subprogram 2, with transaction advisory support, bidding \npackages were issued for program elements (including for registration kits and the Authenticated \nBiometric Identification System) that constitute major program milestones.28 With ADB TA and \nstaff support, a 4-year implementation road map on the identification system was approved in \nJanuary  2019.29  The  road  map  includes  actions  to  increase  financial  inclusion  through \nstreamlined  identity  verification  process  that  would  enable  opening  of  accounts.  A \ncommunications strategy  was  developed  as  well  as  an  overall  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework. Additional  TA  supported  an  assessment  and  plan  for  upgrading  information \ntechnology systems to facilitate integration of PhilSys within the Department of Social Welfare \nand Development and  to help increase efficiency, reduce cost, and better support the 4Ps \nconditional cash transfer program.30 Further, ADB has worked closely with the BSP to build on \nsubprogram 1 reforms to collaboratively test ways to strengthen agriculture finance and insurance, \nimprove coordination and monitoring of financial literacy, and explore innovation in the banking \nsector using financial technology.  ADB has also worked closely with the SEC to further develop \naccreditation standards for MNGOs to professionalize and scale-up their operations. Through \nadditional TA, ADB has provided awareness-raising and capacity-building workshops and training \nfor government and civil society organizations supporting Islamic financial services.31 ADB will \nalso be supporting gender-focused policy reforms that support women\u2019s financial inclusion and \nentrepreneurship, which will be developed under subprogram 3.32 \n \nHow the Inclusive Finance Development Program Complements Other \nAsian Development Bank Initiatives in the Philippines \nThe  Inclusive Finance Development Program (IFDP)  complements and supports a number of recent Asian \nDevelopment Bank programs in the Philippines. The Competitive and Inclusive Agriculture Development Program aims \nto support the government\u2019s effort to increase competitiveness and inclusiveness of the agriculture sector by  \n(i) implementing agricultural trade policy and regulatory reforms, (ii) enhancing public services and finance for the \nsector, and (iii) increasing social protection to rural families.33 Under the IFDP, strengthening agriculture value chain \nfinance and incentivizing private sector participation in agriculture finance will reinforce the efforts to make agriculture \nin the Philippines more competitive and inclusive. Building the technology capacity of rural banks and extending digital \nplatforms for agriculture financial services under the IFDP will further enhance the impact and reach of the Competitive \nand Inclusive Agriculture Development Program. \n \nThe Expanded Social Assistance Project, approved in May 2020, supports the government\u2019s Pantawid Pamilyang \nPilipino Program by financing a portion of the education and health conditional cash transfers provided to poor \nhouseholds; strengthening the Department of Social Welfare and Development\u2019s compliance verification, payroll, and \ngrievance redress  systems;  building linkages  with  complementary social  programs; and  improving project \nmanagement, monitoring, and impact evaluation.34 The IFDP will help accelerate and enhance the efficiency and \nimpact of the Expanded Social Assistance Project with the rollout of the Philippine Identification System, which \nprioritizes low-income heads of households and linkages of the identification system to a bank account. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n28 ADB's Office of Public\u2013Private Partnerships has provided substantial TA from various sources and staff resources to \nsupport PhilSys. \n29 ADB. 2016.

For over two decades, ADB has supported the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of increasing financial inclusion in the Philippines through close coordination \nand  collaboration  with  development  partners.  Overall coordination  of development  partner \nsupport has been managed through the NSFI steering committee, chaired by the BSP. Bilaterally, \nADB and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit have worked together to \ndevelop a strong regulatory framework and financial literacy for microinsurance and have jointly \nsupported development of a pilot PPP program for agriculture insurance. Since 2018, the World \nBank and ADB have collaborated to support implementation and rollout of PhilSys. ADB also \nclosely coordinates with the United States Agency for International Development, which recently \napproved additional funding for the E-PESO project that supports use of \u202felectronic payments, \nand launched the Delivering\u202fEffective Government for Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth \nProgram to expand financing, markets, and linkages for MSMEs. Finally, in addition to its parallel \ncofinancing of subprogram 1, the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement will provide TA to support \nsubprogram 3 in key areas including agriculture insurance, regulatory strengthening, and digital \ntransformation of financial institutions.35,36 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n26.  Economic impact of the program. The program impact assessment  considers the \nobjectives of the program and how likely the key reforms will generate economic benefits. Overall, \nthe program acts as a catalyst by creating an appropriate regulatory structure and business \nenvironment and by encouraging businesses to grow through the use of technology. The benefits \nof the program come from more adults with bank accounts, which are necessary for financial \ninclusion. In addition to economic growth, the program will produce other social benefits, including \nreduced poverty; decreased inequality; improved financial stability; more opportunities for women; \nand increased climate resilience of the vulnerable poor, MSMEs, and financial institutions.37 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n27.  The total financing needs of the Philippines in 2020 are expected to be substantial. The \nannual budget deficit was originally programmed at 3.2% of GDP in 2020, down from 3.4% in \n2019. However, revenues will be significantly lower because of the economic contraction and \nhigher spending resulting from the impact of COVID-19, and the deficit is expected to widen to \n8.4% of GDP in 2020. As such, the government\u2019s financing requirement is expected to reach a \nrecord \u20b12.9 trillion ($58 billion), financed through domestic borrowing (74%) and foreign borrowing \n(26%). The government has requested a regular loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. The loan size for subprogram 2 reflects \nthe government\u2019s development financing needs, the strength of the program, and the economic \nbenefits (para. 26). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The DOF is the executing agency. The BSP, the SEC, PhilGuarantee, the Philippine \nStatistics Authority, the Department of Justice, and the Insurance Commission will be the primary \n \n35 The Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement anticipates to also cofinance subprogram 2. \n36 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nimplementing agencies. Implementation will be overseen by a steering committee chaired by the \nDOF, with the  implementing  agencies  as  members. The  implementation  periods  are  May \n2018\u2013April 2020 for subprogram 2 and May 2020\u2013May 2023 for subprogram 3. The proceeds of \n \nthe policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified  category C for environment, involuntary resettlement,  and  indigenous  people\u2019s \nsafeguards. The program is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards impacts \nwithin the meaning of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n30.  Poverty. The poor are most affected by the low levels of financial inclusion across the \ncountry as financial exclusion deprives them of opportunities to increase their income and mitigate \nvarious  risks  through  credit,  savings,  insurance,  pensions,  and  remittances.  COVID-19 is \nexpected to exacerbate absolute poverty in the short term because of the weak labor market, \ncritical food shortages,  reduced or eliminated household  earnings,  and a drastic decline in \nremittances. Measures under subprogram 2 will help create opportunity and build resilience, \nparticularly among poorer  segments of the population  through  (i) inclusion  in  the PhilSys, \n(ii) increased support for agriculture finance and insurance, (iii) facilitation of basic deposit and \ndigital accounts, and (iv) targeted financial literacy initiatives. \n \n31.  Gender. Subprogram 2 is  categorized  as  having  some gender  elements.  Financial \ninclusion in the Philippines continues to favor women, with a higher proportion of women (39%) \nholding accounts as compared to men (30%) (footnote 9). At the same time, women face cultural, \nsocial, and educational barriers, including the lack of (i) formal documentation of identification, \n(ii) immovable properties and assets owned under their names, (iii) financial independence from \ntheir partners or from other family members, and (iv) mobility. Many of these barriers are linked \nto their role as their families\u2019 primary caretakers. The program targets reforms while ensuring \nconsideration of the unique challenges faced by women and businesses owned by women. Key \npolicy measures under subprogram 2  supported  financial inclusion  among women through: \n(i) implementation of a national identification system, considering that women are less likely than \nmen to have identification documents required to open a bank account; (ii) introduction of cash \nagents and other financial technology innovations such as digital platforms, which can benefit \nmore  women in  areas  without  a  banking  presence;  (iii)  strengthening  of  MNGOs, which \npredominantly serve women; (iv) increased diversity and impact of activities in the NSFI with the \ninclusion of the PCW in the financial inclusion steering committee; and (v) approval of the first \ncomprehensive MSME demand study with a gender focus. The collection of sex-disaggregated \ndata has been prioritized throughout the program. Subprogram 3 is expected to achieve effective \ngender mainstreaming through the inclusion of the PCW to the NSFI and the results of the \ncomprehensive MSME survey which will be used to (i) approve an updated an NSFI action plan \nwith gender-focused targets, (ii) adopt a national definition of women-owned or led businesses, \n(iii) establish and chair a national  task force on women-owned or led businesses, and (iv) adopt \na  robust  monitoring  and  valuation  framework for  measuring  progress  that  includes  sex-\ndisaggregated data. \n \n32.  Governance. While an updated assessment of the 2016 Public Expenditure and Financial \nAccountability report is being carried out, the government has set an aggressive reform agenda \nto promote effective and honest governance and to create an enabling environment for citizens \nand the private sector. The framework of the Public Financial Management Reform Roadmap, \n ", "12 \n2017\u20132022 aims to strengthen the foundation of the public financial management system.38 The \nkey reforms target improvements in costing, cash management, planning and budgeting, and \nprocurement.  The  government's  performance  relative  to  international  fiscal  transparency \nstandards and indicators of corruption has improved. The draft public financial accountability act \nwill further clarify rules and policies on budget formulation, preparation, enactment, and execution \nand significantly improve linkages between budgeting and planning, congressional powers of the \npurse, and oversight of public spending. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government, including the DOF. \n \n33.  Risks and mitigating measures. Overall risks are considered substantial because of the \neconomic, financial, and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country. Areas of \nhighest risk include changes in political priorities preventing implementation of identified reform \nareas, a significant and rapid deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, and corresponding \nincrease in poverty rates. The government's rapid, targeted fiscal policy response to the pandemic \nand an accommodating monetary policy stance signal  a readiness  to take further steps  as \nnecessary to strengthen macroeconomic conditions.39 The lack of sufficient capacity limits the \nability of relevant government agencies to upgrade their existing systems to support increased \nfinancial  inclusion.  ADB  has  helped  mitigate  risks  through  TA  prior  to  and  throughout \nimplementation of the program and will continue to engage in regular policy dialogue through the \nNSFI steering  committee.40 ADB and  other  development partners  will mitigate  the  risk  of \ncorruption with a whole-of-government approach to strengthen public financial management and \nimprove procurement. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n34.  The government, including the DOF, has assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)   the loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the \nInclusive Finance Development Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nin regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending  facility; for a term of 15 years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance with those  set  forth in  the  draft loan  agreement \npresented to the Board, and \n(ii)   the inclusion of subprogram 3 in the programmatic approach, as described in \n \nparagraph 4.\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n30 July 2020 \n \n38 DBM Bulletin.
