Implemented \nArrangements  by commune-sangkat councils with support from the Ministry of \nInterior (MoI) and Department of Local Administration, and the \nsupport of the project technical cell (PTC) in DoLA. \n(ii) Component 2: Capacity building. Implemented by the DoLA \nCapacity-Building  Office,  with  support  from  PTC,  through \nspecialist providers of local training, and mass media agencies, \nwith international technical assistance (TA) support. \n(iii) Component 3: Photomapping. Implemented by the Ministry of \nLand  Management,  Urban  Planning,  and  Construction \n(MoLMUPC) as part of the joint donor-financed national aerial \northophoto mapping initiative, and in liason with the PTC. \n(iv) Component 4: Civil registration. Implemented by MoI\u2019s Office \nof Civil Registration, with support from PTC.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Interior \n   \nConsulting Services  (i) 56 person-months of international consultants \n(ii) 132 person- months of local consultants \n   ", "iv \nProject Benefits and  The immediate beneficiaries and benefits are as follows: \nBeneficiaries  (i)  Component  1:  440  commune-sangkat  councils  and  24 \nprovincial line departments were provided with essential operating \nfacilities and communication and transport equipment.  \n(ii) Component 2: 14,000 councilors and government officers were \ntrained; the whole population provided with information about local \ngovernment  roles  and  responsibilities;  and  TA  provided  to \nNational Committee for Support to Commune-Sangkat Councils \nand line ministries. \n(iii) Component 3: 550 communes and sangkat were provided with \nup-to-date photomaps for land-use planning and land allocation \n(as part of the multi jointly funded national orthophoto mapping \ninitiative. \n(iv) Component 4: all communes, sangkat, districts, and provinces \nwere provided with effective systems, training, and equipment to \noperate the new national civil registration system. \n \nThe ultimate beneficiaries will be the population of Cambodia, who \nwill benefit from improved governance, greater voice, and more \naccountable  and  transparent  service  delivery,  enabled  by  a \nproperly resourced, trained, and motivated tier of elected local \ngovernment.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Achievement of the Project outputs is low risk. Achievement of the \nProject\u2019s poverty-reducing goal depends on the assumption that \ncouncilors  and  government  staff  effectively  use  the  facilities, \nequipment, training, systems, and maps provided, and that the \nGovernment ensures that the positive opportunities created by \ndecentralization  are  not  undermined  by  other  weaknesses  in \ngovernance and public institutions.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  TA is to be provided, at the request of the Government, for $1.26 \nmillion, with financing expected from Sida and the Government of \nthe Netherlands. \n \nThe  TA  will  include  support  for  (i)  sound  procurement  and \nutilization of all works and goods; (ii) capacity building analysis, \norganizational  development,  and  training;  (iii)  mass  media \nawareness  campaigns;  (iv)  photomapping;  and  (v)  civil \nregistration. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Commune Council Development Project; and (ii) \nadministration by Asian Development Bank (ADB) of proposed technical assistance (TA) for the \nRoyal  Government\u2019s  Ministry  of  Interior  (MoI)  and  Ministry  of  Land  Management,  Urban \nPlanning, and Construction (MoLMUPC). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  Since  early  2001,  decentralization  has  been  the  fastest-progressing  element  in \nCambodia\u2019s effort to strengthen governance and promote administrative reform. The creation of \nelected commune and sangkat councils in February 2002 produced significant opportunities to \nembed peace and democracy in the country, increase accountability and transparency, and \nenhance pro-poor participatory development. Decentralization marks a significant alteration in \nthe structure of governance and is intrinsically multisectoral. \n \n3.   The authenticity of the Government\u2019s commitment to decentralization is apparent from \n(i) the pace at which legislation and supporting subdecrees and pronouncements have been \nenacted in 2001\u20132002, including the laws on commune elections and the administration of \ncommunes in early 2001; (ii) creation in mid-2001 of the Interministerial National Committee for \nSupport to Communes-Sangkat (NCSC), and its subcommittees, which are responsible for \nimplementing decentralization; and (iii) commitment of significant resources from the national \nbudget to the election process and to the fund for commune administrative and development \nexpenditure. \n \n4.  The Government views decentralization as a pro-poor initiative that will help reduce \npoverty more effectively than previous efforts. This view is evident in formal position papers, \nnotably the Socioeconomic Development Plan 2 (2002) and the Governance Action Plan 2001, \nand in repeated verbal commitments by government leaders. \n \n5.  Most  observers  considered  the  first  commune-sangkat  council  elections,  held  on  3 \nFebruary 2002, to have been free and fair. Although registration and the run-up to polling day \nsaw some violence, observers agree that the elections created genuine popular interest and \nhave  been  a  significant  step  forward  in  embedding  democratic  concepts  and  practices  in \nCambodia. The election results have been broadly accepted, and no concerted campaign has \nbeen waged against the conduct of the election or its outcome. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n6.  With Cambodia\u2019s 1,621 elected commune-sangkat councils coming into existence only \nin February 2002, no performance data are available. The key administrative and local council \ndata are in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  Despite  remarkable  progress  to  date  in  introducing  democracy  to  Cambodia,  the \nGovernment faces multiple problems in ensuring that decentralization leads to positive change \nin people\u2019s lives. The country has 1,621 new councils, each with one clerk; 11,261 newly \nelected councilors; and a population still unfamiliar with the concept and role of elected local \ngovernment. The task of formulating and internalizing transparent democratic practices and ", "2 \nappropriate legal, administrative, fiscal, and supervision mechanisms is, therefore, immense, \nparticularly as human resources and institutional capacity are weak throughout the country. \n \n8.   The  Project  preparation  team1  conducted  a  thorough  needs  appraisal,  including \ninterviews with newly elected councilors; provincial, district, and central government officials; \nexternally funded projects; and nongovernment organization (NGOs). The first need, identified \nby all informants, was for council meeting and working facilities, communications, transport and \nequipment, particularly in poorer rural communes, and in many provincial and district offices \nresponsible  for  supporting  and  supervising  councils.  Several  informants  also  stressed  that \ncommune-sangkat premises are \u201cmini-parliaments\u201d that must promote local pride in councils \nand  in  the  democratic  process  from  which  they  derive  their  mandate.  The  second  need, \nidentified by all informants, is for continued capacity building (CB), training, coaching, and \nsupport  for  councilors,  clerks,  and  local  and  central  government  officers,  to  embed  an \nunderstanding  of  democratic  functioning,  roles,  and  responsibilities,  and  to  familiarize  all \nparticipants with the details of the legal system and procedures governing council and provincial \noperations. The third and pressing need is to deepen popular awareness of the scope of local \ndemocracy and the roles of citizens, councilors, and officers in elected local government. All \ncitizens  must  understand  that  councilors  are  elected  representatives  who  can  amplify  the \npopular voice and channel concerns over the quality of service delivery and other matters of \nlocal concern. Fourth, the emerging legislative and procedural framework for council operations \nrequires  strengthening.  Ten  subdecrees,  pronouncements,  and  associated  guidelines  have \nbeen  issued  within  the  framework  of  the  Law  on  Commune  Administration,  but  more  are \nrequired, and all informants agree that those published need to be more consistent, simple, and \nclear. Fifth, the first ministerial responsibility devolved to the newly elected councils is civil \nregistration of births, deaths, and marriages. The existing provision is a patchwork of different \nprovincial  systems;  statistical  aggregation  is  difficult,  and  millions  of  births,  deaths,  and \nmarriages going back many years remain nonformalized. MoI has made good progress with \nestablishing  a  new,  nationally  standardized  system,  founded  on  the  new  civil  registration \nsubdecree adopted in December 2000, but support is required to develop councils\u2019 ability to \noperate the new system, and establish an effective national statistical system based upon it. \n(For the recent history of civil registration, see Appendix 2) \n \n9.  The components and activities selected for financing under this Project address all of \nthese identified needs. All the proposed activities are fully consistent with the decentralization \nsupport needs presented by Government at the sixth consultative group meeting for Cambodia \nheld in Phnom Penh in June 2002. All activities have been thoroughly discussed with the \nGovernment and are also consistent with the approach and future resourcing plans of other \ndonors. The Project complements the Seila Program, which is the largest current donor support \ninitiative for decentralization. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002.

The Project goal is faster poverty reduction through more participatory, transparent, and \naccountable  governance.  The  Project  purpose  is  to  provide  most  commune  and  sangkat \ncouncils  with  facilities,  equipment,  systems,  training,  popular  understanding,  and  support \nrequired to function effectively. The Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy Form is in \nAppendix 3. \n \n11.  The Project will help develop a new tier of democratic local government throughout \nCambodia, and is the first such project of the ADB in any country. The commune-sangkat \ngoverns local affairs of its territory based on the Constitution, law, royal decree, subdecree, \nproclamations, and relevant norms and standards. The full list of functions is being developed \nover time through the promulgated legal framework. Among the functions assigned are planning \nand implementation of small-scale rural infrastructure (Seila Program), civil registration, and \nvoter registration. The training and CB, and TA support under component 2, the multidonor \northophoto  mapping  initiative  to  which  component  3  contributes,  and  support  for  the  civil \nregistration system under component 4 are all national in scope. Beneficiary communes for \nfacility assistance under component 1 will be selected from all rural provinces. \n  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n1.  Component 1: Commune and Provincial Facilities ($9.09 million) \n \n12.  Component  1  will  provide  or  improve  the  meeting,  communication,  transport,  and \nworking facilities that commune-sangkat councils require. The component will also provide \nequipment and some facility support to the provincial offices of local administration (POLAs) and \nmeet the essential needs of provincial treasuries. \n \n13.   Subcomponent 1-1 (commune facilities) will provide or rehabilitate facilities and furnish \napproximately 440 commune-sangkat councils. Two model designs will be developed to suit \ndifferent local circumstances. The model designs will provide the basic space required and \ninclude flexibility in the initial lay-out, enabling future adaptation or expansion by the councils \nover time. The initial design concept includes four rooms in a large, covered meeting space. The \nfirst will be a multipurpose room for council members and small meetings. The second will be \nsufficient for the council clerk to undertake his or her duties, including safekeeping of council \nand civil registration records, petty cash, equipment, and the communications radio. The third \nand fourth rooms will provide meeting space for commune-level line ministry and other service \ndelivery activities, including meetings of school and/or community governing bodies, women's \nassociations,  and  community  organizations.  All  four  rooms  will  be  furnished  with  locally \nprocured  wooden  furniture.  Large,  covered,  and  protected  information  boards  will  display \ncouncil notices, income and expenditure information, the voter list, and activities of service \nministries,  including  education  enrolment  dates  and  procedures,  mobile  health  team  and \nvaccination  visits,  land  allocation  issues,  and  HIV/AIDS  and  other  awareness  campaign \ninformation. \n \n14.   Other elements have been considered for addition to the model designs, including more \noffices, a water pump and well, latrines, a kitchen, fencing and gates, and a surrounding garden. \nHowever, the intention of the Project is to provide the essential basic facilities to as many poor \ncommunes as possible. Plenty of evidence exists\uf8e7from pagoda construction and many official ", "4 \nand  NGO  projects\uf8e7that  communes  are  able  to  mobilize  additional  resources  from  local \ncontributions, NGOs, local elites, etc. The intention of this Project is that once councils have a \nbasic, distinctive facility of which they can be proud, the other desirable features of council \noperations  should  be  provided  over  time  from  the  council\u2019s  own  initiative  and  from  local \nresources. \n \n15.  The Project, however, will not be able to meet the whole demand for improved council \nfacilities, and an NCSC-approved prioritization and selection methodology will be required. The \nprioritization procedure must be objective, clear, and transparent. This procedure is summarized \nin Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n16.   The sangkat within the four municipalities are ineligible for three reasons: (i) average \nincomes  and  local  resources  are  higher  within  the  municipalities,  (ii)  meeting  and \ncommunication facilities are less of a constraint, and (iii) the likelihood of sangkat mergers as a \nresult of the commune boundary review may be greater than in rural areas. \n \n17.   The prioritized and selected commune-sangkat councils will choose the model design \nmost appropriate to their location, vulnerability to flooding, and land conditions. Councils will be \nfree to adapt the basic design but within the fixed subsidy package for each model design. The \nfacility allocation to each commune will be incorporated into the commune council\u2019s annual \nbudget, either as an amendment if works are scheduled for the current year, or as part of the \nfollowing  year\u2019s  budget.  To  facilitate  transfer,  reporting,  and  supervision,  the  works  in  the \nselected communes will be organized in provincial batches. Following a pilot phase in one \nprovince, implementation will be in three further phases covering all communes in 6, 6, and 7 \nprovinces respectively (total 20 provinces). The three phases are expected to last about 12 \nmonths each, but will overlap, for a total implementation period for subcomponent 1-1 of about \n24 months. \n \n18.   The commune council will procure works in accordance with the Ministry of Economy \nand Finance (MEF) subdecree on the commune-sangkat financial management system and the \nassociated  procurement  guidelines  (as  used  for  existing  transfers  from  the  Government\u2019s \nCommune  Fund  and  the  Seila  Program).  The  selected  councils  will  plan,  manage,  and \nimplement the building or rehabilitation process, using local contractors, including certification of \npayments to contractors. This local contracting and procurement process is already reasonably \nfamiliar in many communes as a result of the Seila Program. Communes will be required to \npublicize all financial allocations to the commune, and the contract amounts awarded to local \ncontractors. \n \n19.   Existing or new plots of land for the commune facilities will be on state land. Any new \nplot chosen will be centrally located and on a main road. The commune will be required to \nregister the land in the name of the council, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law \n2001. Any new selected site will be unoccupied, either by official or unofficial, unregistered \nsettlement. This requirement will be formally verified by the supervising architect or engineers \nbefore the block grant subsidy is transferred. \n \n20.  The running costs, repair, and maintenance of the facilities will be the sole responsibility \nof the commune council after completion. No recurrent cost problems are likely.2 International \n                                                 \n2  Annual maintenance costs of an average $14,000 building/furniture are around $600. Recurrent costs of radios, \nmotorcycles  (excluding  fuel),  and  typewriters  are  about  $100  to  $150  per  commune-sangkat  per  annum. ", "5 \nexperience  is  that  once  local  government  facilities  become  an  established  center  for  the \ncommunity,  councilors  are  keen  to  maintain  and  upgrade  facilities  over  time.  Many  local \ngovernments worldwide choose to upgrade their own facilities ahead of other needed local \nworks. This risk is likely to be moderated in Cambodia since the local administrative budget is \ntight  and  centrally  controlled  as  a  share  of  total  commune  resources.  Provided  the  initial \nfacilities are sufficient to generate pride and respect, councilors will no doubt seek to maintain \nand improve their premises. The facilities and equipment provided will constitute durable assets \nassigned  to  the  council,  within  the  meaning  of  Article  49  of  the  MEF  subdecree  on  the \ncommune-sangkat financial management system. The council has no right to sell or transfer the \ndurable assets assigned, other than with the approval of MoI and MEF. \n \n21.   Subcomponent 1-2 will provide around 1,000 radios and cell phones and around 580 \nmotorcycles  for  remote  commune-sangkat  councils.  Improved  radio  and  motorcycle \ncommunications  are  essential  for  liaison  between  councils  and  provincial  departments  for \nfinancial, planning, and administrative matters. Few remote rural communes have access to \nland-line telephone networks. Although the cell-phone network is expanding and urban areas \nare now well served, coverage in remote rural areas is poor and recurrent costs continue to be \nvery high. The use of radio systems has been well piloted through the Seila Program and the \nNational Election Commission, and radios are the most appropriate and cost-efficient means of \ncommunication in remote areas. In communes where cell-phone coverage is newly available, \nthe  Project  will  consider  supplying  cell  phones  rather  than  radios  if  so  requested  by  the \ncommune. The equipment will be centrally procured by the project technical cell (PTC)\u2014which \nwill be established temporarily in MoI's Department of Local Administration (DoLA) for the \nProject duration\u2014and delivered to POLAs for collection by the selected communes. \n \n22.   Subcomponent 1-3 will conduct minor refurbishment for up to 12 POLAs and provincial \ntreasuries and will support essential equipment needs not met by other donor partners. The \nequipment to be supplied will include computers, telephones, fax, e-mail, and motorcycles.  \n \n23.  The PTC is budgeted under component 1 as subcomponent 1-4.3 PTC staffing is as \nfollows: \n  \n(i)  One  accountant  (a  local  consultant,  36  person-months)  experienced  in  ADB \nprocedures  and  responsible  for  all  accounting,  safekeeping  of  expenditure \nrecords, and financial reporting to ADB. \n(ii)   One  architect  (international  consultant,  12  person-months)  and  four  local \nconsultant architects and/or engineers (24 person-months each) to support all \naspects of the implementation of component 1 and the design of the cupboard or \nsafes under component 4. Experienced international TA is essential in view of \nthe size of component 1, and because the financing and reporting systems for \nsubcomponent 1-1 are new to Cambodia and ADB. Activities will include (a) \nfinalizing  the  commune  selection  procedure  and  the  commune  facilities \nagreement, (b) surveying selected communes, (c) finalizing standard designs \nand adaptations to meet local needs, (d) monitoring and supervising ongoing \nworks, and (e) helping with financial transfers and reporting. This is a substantial \ntask:  with  at  least  440  communes  involved  for  24  months,  the  three  PTC \n                                                                                                                                                          \nCommune-sangkat income in 2003 is likely to include an average $2,500 administrative cost transfer, plus civil \nregistration fees and other local charges.  \n3 The PTC will take over the office equipment provided under the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). \nThe  only  additional  PTC  equipment  budgeted  under  this  Project  is  three  vehicles,  to  enable  support  and \nsupervision of component-1 activities. ", "6 \narchitect/engineers  in  the  field  will  supervise  and  help  works  in  about  20 \ncommunes per month.  \n(iii)  One coordinator and four other staff, seconded to the PTC from DoLA. They will \nsupport and coordinate as, appropriate, the implementation of activities under \ncomponents 1, 2, 3, and 4, including liaising with DoLA\u2019s six offices, Office of \nCivil  Registration  (OoCR),  24  POLAs,  MoLMUPC,  and  other  government \nministries.  \n  \n2.  Component 2: Capacity Building ($2.75 million) \n \n24.  All  four  Project  components  contribute  to  developing  aspects  of  decentralization \ncapacity, including the provision of council operating facilities under component 1, commune \nphotomaps under component 3, and equipping and civil registration system capacities under \ncomponent 4. Component 2 provides a package of interventions to help build institutional, \norganizational, and individual capacities. \n \n25.   The starting point for this component will be a concise but comprehensive CB analysis \nto (i) define the long-term strategic CB requirements for the Government\u2019s decentralization \nprogram, including needs at commune-sangkat council, district and/or provincial, and national \nlevels; (ii) provide a baseline assessment against which progress in CB can be measured over \ntime; (iii) assess the gender impact of CB to date, and identify concrete CB measures to \nenhance the role and representation of women in decentralization; and (iv) assess immediate \nCB needs, and determine priorities for the use of the training and public awareness resources \nprovided  by  the  Project.  This  CB  analysis  will  be  undertaken  by  the  international  TA \n(subcomponent 2-3) and DoLA CB staff, and in close coordination with the other providers of TA \nto DoLA.4 The outcome of the analysis will be submitted to the NCSC CB subcommittee, and \nwill be used to help develop and refine the DoLA/NCSC work plans and to guide the annual \ntraining plans (ATPs) and mass media campaign plans for subcomponents 2-1 and 2-2.5  \n \n26.   Subcomponent 2-1 finances NCSC training programs for commune-sangkat councilors, \nclerks, and local and national officials to ensure they are aware of their roles and functions and \nable  to  implement  decentralization  procedures  effectively.  The  training  activities  will  be \nimplemented over three years. The NCSC CB subcommittee has established good coordination \namong agencies in implementing the 2002 national program of initial councilor training, and \ndeveloped  professional  methodologies  and  materials.6  Building  on  the  cooperation \narrangements  achieved,  DoLA  will  prepare  an  ATP,  for  agreement  by  the  NCSC  CB \nsubcommittee.  The  ATP  will  define  training  priorities  for  the  coming  year,  implementation \nmethods, costing, and financing arrangements. With several agencies already committed to \nsupporting  CB  during  the  Project  (notably  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit  (German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation)  [GTZ],  the  Seila  Program, \nPartnership for Local Governance (Seila Program TA) [PLG], and United Nations Development \nProgram [UNDP]), the ATP will indicate sources of financing for each element of the plan. \nPriorities  will  include  training  in  governance  and  democratic  concepts,  council  internal \nprocedures, planning and financial procedures, and implementation of the Land Law 2001. \nDetailed  information  on  support  to  decentralization  from  external  funding  agencies  is  in \nAppendix 4. \n                                                 \n4 SIDA. 2001. Sida\u2019s Policy for Capacity Development provides a useful analytic framework for the capacity building \n(CB) analysis.  \n5  A preliminary assessment of DoLA's capacity to implement this Project is in Appendix 7. \n6  GTZ. 2001. Capacity Building for Decentralization and Commune-Sangkat administration and management: How \nto initiate the first steps - An Operational Handbook.  ", "7 \n27.  Training  modules  will  include  refresher  training  for  the  11,200  commune-sangkat \ncouncilors and clerks in their roles, functions, and procedures; and training for the concerned \ngovernment  staff  in  all  24  provinces  and  their  districts  in  supporting  and  supervising  the \ncommune-sangkat councils. Provincial treasury staff teams will receive training in computerized \naccounting techniques, supporting the work initiated by the Seila Program and PLG in 17 \nprovinces. Training will include provincial and national seminars to review procedures, and \nsystems' overall progress and needs, with reference to the financial management aspects of \ncommune facility development under subcomponent 1-1. \n \n28.   As the role of commune-sangkat councils in land-use planning, management, allocation, \nand natural resource management comes to be defined over the loan period, training in these \nissues, enabled by the availability of commune-sangkat photomaps (see component 3), will \nbecome significant.7 The DoLA Capacity-Building Office will manage the design and production \nof agreed-upon training modules. As for the council orientation training in 2002, the responsible \nline ministries will lead the technical content of the training modules and provide master trainers. \nTargeted training programs will be provided for female and ethnic minority councilors, clerks, \nand officials. Training implementation will be through a combination of the Seila Program and \nPLG network, master trainers, and other facilitators already available in many provinces, and \nsubcontracting to NGOs. \n \n29.   Subcomponent 2-2 finances an NCSC public awareness campaign, using the mass \nmedia, to help embed among the whole population essential concepts of local democracy; and \ncitizen, councilor, and officer rights, roles, and responsibilities. The campaign will cover council \nservice delivery activities, including implementation of local development schemes, financed \nthrough the Commune Fund.8 A public awareness campaign was approved by NCSC in autumn \n2001, as part of the first NCSC work plan, but was not implemented due to a shortage of \nfinancing and TA. DoLA staff, with TA support, will design an annual mass media campaign \nplan, for approval by NCSC. The mass media strategy will be based on the preparation of a \nbrief for subcontracting to experienced local media agencies, procured on a competitive basis. \nLike similar campaigns on mine awareness and health issues, the campaign is likely to use a \nmix of radio, TV, posters, audiotapes, and public meetings. Production and distribution of a \nregular NCSC information bulletin will be an early priority. \n \n30.  Subcomponent 2-3 provides a total of 30 person-months of international TA to DoLA and \nNCSC, including one long-term position (18 person-months) and a series of short-term inputs \n(total 12 person-months). In close cooperation with other TA providers, this TA will accomplish \nthe following:  \n \n(i)  Contribute to the CB analysis. \n(ii)   Ensure  the  effective  planning  and  use  of  the  training  fund  provided  under \nsubcomponent 2-1.  \n(iii)  Help  conceptualize,  design,  and  make  subcontracting  arrangements  for  the \npublic awareness campaign.  \n(iv)  Help strengthen NCSC liaison with major service ministries, including identifying \nservice areas with the potential for decentralization, or where commune-sangkat \ncouncils  could  have  greater  involvement  in  particular  line  ministry  service \n                                                 \n7  In August 2002, the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction (MoLMUPC) has prepared \nguidelines for the commune-sangkat role in land-use planning, dispute resolution, and other Land Law-related \nmatters. \n8  About 60% of communes and sangkat are expected to have Commune Fund development finance during 2003, \nand all by 2004.  ", "8 \nfunctions.  The  priority  ministries  for  initial  decentralization  discussions  are \nagriculture, education, health, land, and public works. The TA and DoLA staff will \nestablish a liaison mechanism with the major service ministries, and\u2014where \ndeveloping a role for commune-sangkat councils is of interest\u2014will help develop \naction plans and pilot activities. Early opportunities are likely to include piloting a \nrole for commune-sangkat councils with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and \nSports in relation to education incentives for girls and ethnic minorities (under \nfunding from ADB and Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction) and in building primary \nschools  (under  scheduled  ADB,  World  Bank,  Unite  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n[UNICEF],  and  Belgium  Aid  support).  A  similar  opportunity  may  be  in \nstrengthening  the  women  and  children  subcommittee  of  commune-sangkat \ncouncils, in partnership with the Ministry of Women's and Veterans Affairs.  \n(v)   Help  DoLA  and  the  Department  of  General  Administration  (DGA)  develop  a \ndecentralization  policy,  the  legal  system,  and  procedures,  including  gender \nanalysis and strengthening, according to need. \n \n31.  The TA consultants will not seek to develop an autonomous project role or sphere of \ninfluence. All TA inputs will be incorporated into the framework of DoLA and NCSC annual and \nmedium-term work plans, and the various subplans for training, mass media, and other activity \nareas. The TA will work in close cooperation with other providers of TA to DoLA and NCSC \nministries and will aim to develop the autonomous strength and corporate capacity of DoLA, \nMoI, and NCSC. \n \n3.  Component 3: Commune-Sangkat Photomapping ($1.20 million) \n \n32.  Resolving issues of land-use planning, land disputes, access to common-property land- \nand water resources, and land allocation and management is central to poverty reduction, and \ndevelopment. Component 3 is the Project\u2019s contribution to the joint donor-financed initiative to \nprovide up-to-date digital and paper photomaps for the whole country. Photomaps are essential \nin enabling commune and sangkat councils to play their designated role in land-related issues. \nUp-to-date maps and the associated digital database will also be important for the NCSC\u2019s \nboundary  review  process  and  subsequent  commune  boundary  demarcation,  and  are  a \nnecessary part of the national data infrastructure and of importance to several ministries and \nactivities. \n \n33.  During  the  first  mandate  of  the  commune-sangkat  councils  (2002\u201307),  the  NCSC \nboundaries and urbanization subcommittee, chaired by MoLMUPC, leads in defining the role of \ncommune and sangkat councils in implementing the Land Law 2001. Initial draft papers assign \na significant role to councils in land management, land-use planning and allocation, issuing \npermits, and other aspects of the implementation of the 2001 Land Law. This subcommittee will \nalso be leading NCSC\u2019s review of commune and sangkat boundaries. \n \n34.  The output of this component is provision of hard copies of digitally enlarged, up-to-date \naerial photomaps (at a scale of 1:10,000, or at any other scale required) to about 550 commune \nand  sangkat  councils  and  the  concerned  provincial  and  district  departments  and  national \nauthorities, to enable their role in land management and planning, as part of the joint-donor \ninitiative to finance mapping of the whole country. The major activities for this component are \naerial photography of one third of the country, followed by scanning, digitizing, and rectification, \nleading to production of digital orthophotos. The required inputs are financing of the aerial \nphotography, digitizing, and map production, and 5 months of geographic information system ", "9 \n(GIS)\u2013digital mapping TA to support MoLMUPC's National Mapping Initiative, also funded by the \nWorld Bank, Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), ADB, and GTZ. \n \n35.  The technology is proven, and already in use by MoLMUPC. The most cost-effective and \nuseful method of creating maps for local land management purposes is to obtain recent aerial \nphotographs (at scale 1:40,000), convert them into digital orthophotos by scanning, followed by \nrectification to establish exact locations. Maps can then be digitally enlarged or reduced to the \nrequired size and scale, printed, and made widely available to commune-sangkat councils, \nprovincial/district departments, and other involved organizations. \n \n36.  Maps based on aerial photographs provide commune and sangkat councils with the \nessential visualization tool for land-use planning and management. Pilot work in 20 communes \nby  GTZ  and  the  Government  of  Finland\u2019s  contractor  FINNMAP  (as  TA  to  MoLMUPC  in \nassociation with the World Bank-supported $34-million Land Management and Administration \nProject [LMAP]) has shown that ordinary people can readily understand and interpret aerial \nphotographs. Commune-based working groups can easily identify land, buildings, infrastructure, \nand  forests  and  then  map  individual  plots,  commune  and  village  boundaries,  assets,  and \nresources. Access to visualized local information thus becomes a powerful democratic tool.  \n \n37.  The outline for the joint-donor initiative to finance up-to-date aerial photomapping of the \nwhole country, and orthophoto and map production was discussed by the NCSC boundaries \nand urbanization subcommittee in May 2002. The proposal received unanimous support as the \nmost appropriate, cost-efficient, and rapid solution for enabling Government and commune-\nsangkat councils to obtain the maps required for land management. Following the subcommittee \nmeeting, the minister of land management reported the joint-donor initiative to the Council of \nMinisters. \n \n38.  Nationwide coverage will be achieved on an area- and cost-sharing basis as follows: (i) \nJICA, through the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MoPWT), 30% (partly completed in \nJanuary-February 2002); (ii) MoLMUPC and World Bank LMAP [World Bank, MoLMUPC], 15% \n(approved May 2002); (iii) ADB Tonle Sap Resource Project, 20%; and (iv) ADB Commune \nCouncil Development Project, 35%. The flying season in Cambodia is limited to November to \nFebruary. One fifth of the country was photographed from the air in January and February 2002, \nfinanced by the Government of Japan. The remaining parts covered by JICA and LMAP will be \nphotographed  in  November  2002  to  February  2003.  The  two  ADB-financed  parts  will  be \nphotographed in November-February 2003\u201304 and 2004\u201305. The orthophoto maps will be \navailable in phases beginning from the end of 2002. MoLMUPC has requested MoPWT and \nJICA to provide access to the data produced from the areas photographed in early 2002. \n \n4.  Component 4: Civil Registration ($2.08 million) \n \n39.  The output of this component is a well-established and efficient civil registration system \nfor births, deaths, and marriages by the end of 2005, with no unregistered backlog. The recent \nhistory of civil registration system is in Appendix 2. \n \n40.  The component includes 10 activities: \n \n(i)  Commune-sangkat  councilors  will  be  thoroughly  trained  to  operate  the  new \nnational system, and the monthly and quarterly statistical information system. \nTraining will ensure that women and ethnic minority councilors and officials are ", "10 \nfully involved, and that training materials and methodologies are adapted to meet \nwomen's and ethnic minorities' needs.  \n(ii)  Copies  of  the  instruction  manual  for  the  system,  statistical  system,  and \nassociated documents will be made available at all levels.  \n(iii)  An intensive public awareness and mobilization campaign will be launched, using \nmass  media  methods  and  local  mobilizers,  mainly  NGOs,  to  encourage \nhouseholds in low-turn-out areas to complete historic and current registrations. \nBecause women will be key beneficiaries of marriage and birth registration, the \nmedia  campaign  and  selection  of  NGOs  will  prioritize  reaching  women  and \nensuring that they understand the importance of registration. Mobilization will \nalso ensure that ministries and NGOs working with the homeless, street children, \norphans,  and  other  hard-to-reach  groups  are  aware  of  the  importance  of \nregistration and take steps to ensure that these groups are not excluded.  \n(iv)  All communes/sangkat, district and provincial offices (other than those with new \nfacilities financed through component 1, which includes brick cupboards/safes) \nwill be provided with simple but secure steel storage cupboards to preserve \nregistration records, with a separate safe compartment for petty cash.  \n(v)  All commune-sangkats and district offices will be supplied with manual Khmer \ntypewriters.  \n(vi)  All provincial offices of general affairs (under the governor\u2019s cabinet) will be \nprovided  with  a  computer  set  (computer,  printer,  UPS9,  modem)  for  record \nkeeping and communications.  \n(vii)  OoCR will be provided with basic operating equipment, including computers, \ncopiers, three motorcycles, phone or fax, and furniture.  \n(viii)  OoCR will be provided with one four-wheel-drive vehicle to facilitate field visits.  \n(ix)  Nine months of international TA (3 months per annum), specializing in modern \ncivil registration systems, will be provided. This TA will support all aspects of \ndeveloping an efficient modern civil registration system, including developing the \ncapacity of the OoCR staff, systems, and procedures, including unique serial \nnumbering  of  registration  forms,  evaluating  the  performance  of  councils  in \nimplementing the system, extent of coverage achieved, and the rate of reduction \nof registration backlog, identification of low-registration areas, and quality of the \nstatistical  data  provided  from  the  commune  to  the  center.  (Outline  terms  of \nreference [TORs] for this TA are in Appendix 5).  \n(x)  Eight staff selected from OoCR and provinces/communes will visit an appropriate \ndeveloped ADB member country to study the design and implementation of a \nmodern civil registration system. \n \nC.

Each budget line is financed from one \nsource only: Asian Development Bank (ADB); Swedish International Development Cooperation \nAgency (Sida), the Government of Netherlands, or Government of Cambodia. The total contingency \nis estimated at 15% of base cost. The contingency for the Sida-financed items is included in the \nADB budget. Formal approval for the Sida grant and the Government of Netherlands grant is \nexpected to be forthcoming. If this funding does not materialize, the Government has agreed to seek \nalternative cofinancing or to make other arrangements, acceptable to ADB, to fund the amount \nintended to be provided by Sida and the Government of Netherlands. \n \n42.   Proposed ADB financing is for a loan of $10.0 million equivalent (57% of the total \nProject cost) from Asian Development Fund resources, including $5.3 million equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. ADB financing of local currency cost is justified on the basis of the low level \nof national income (around $290 per capita) and savings (14.2% of national income in 2000). \n \n43.  The balance of $7.4 million is expected to be financed by the Government, Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the Government of Netherlands. \nSida parallel cofinancing of $3 million will cover the training fund; the public awareness mass \nmedia campaign in component 2; and the TA for components 1, 2, and 3. The Government of \nNetherlands parallel cofinancing of $2.4 million will support the whole of component 4. The \nGovernment will provide a total of $2 million in kind: the imputed land value of the commune ", "12 \ncouncil premises and the councilor and staff time required for training activities. This Project \nwas formulated under PPTA TAR-35274: TA to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the \nDecentralization Support Program. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n44.   The Project will be executed by MoI. MoI has around 7,000 staff, organized into (i) \nDepartment General of Police, and (ii) DGA. It is responsible for all civil administration, including \nthe appointment and management of provincial governors. \n \n45.  DoLA was established in MoI in July 2001. By mid-2002, DoLA had 39 staff. It is \nresponsible for implementing the Government\u2019s decentralization program, and for acting as \nsecretariat to the interministerial NCSC, chaired by MoI. A summary and assessment of DoLA\u2019s \ncurrent organization, staffing, and capacities is in Appendix 7. \n \n46.  The project director will be the director general, DGA, MoI. The project manager will be \nthe director of DoLA. Because this is the first ADB loan to be executed by MoI, provision has \nbeen made within the PTC, attached to DoLA, for a local consultant accountant familiar with \nADB  procedures  and  requirements  to  be  engaged  during  the  entire  Project  to  help  meet \naccounting and reporting requirements. \n \n47.   Component 1 will be implemented by commune-sangkat councils with support from \nDoLA and the PTC. Component 2 will be implemented by the DoLA Capacity-Building Office, \nwith  support  from  PTC,  and  will  utilize  specialist  local  training  providers  and  mass  media \nagencies, with international TA support. Component 3 will be implemented by the General \nDepartment of Cadastre and Geography, MoLMUPC, as part of a joint donor-financed initiative, \nin liason with PTC. Component 4 will be implemented by OoCR in the ministry\u2019s Department of \nGeneral Administration and with the support of PTC. \n \n48.   The PTC will report to ADB and liaise with MEF, and ensure that all Project activities are \nin accordance with ADB requirements. The PTC has different roles in implementing the four \nProject components. Because DoLA has little in-house capacity for procurement or construction \nplanning and supervision, and because these tasks will not be major ones for DoLA in the \nfuture, the PTC will play a central role in supporting implementation of component 1. For \ncomponent 2, the PTC will support implementation by DoLA\u2019s CB and other offices, and will \nhelp build their capacity. For component 3, the PTC will help DoLA liaison with MoLMUPC. For \ncomponent  4,  the  PTC  will  help  OoCR  design  the  steel  cupboards/safes  and  procure \nequipment. \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n \n49.  The  Project  implementation  period  is  three  years.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be \ncomplete by February 2006. Component 1 is expected to be completed by February 2005. \nFinancing for component 2 is for three years. For component 3, the activities are timed as \nfollows: (i) aerial photography, 2003\u201304; (ii) scanning and orthophoto production, 2003-05; and \n(iii) production of around 8,000 orthophoto maps, 2004-05. Financing for component 4 is for \nthree years (Appendix 8).  \n ", "13 \n3.  Procurement \n \n50.   Under subcomponent 1-1, commune council facilities, including buildings and furniture, \nwill be procured in accordance with the MEF subdecree on the commune-sangkat financial \nmanagement  system  and  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  Regulation  on  Financial \nManagement. The facilities subsidy will be transferred as a block grant (average $14,000 per \ncommune) to each selected commune, and works will be procured following tendering by the \ncommune council procurement committee among local contractors. The selected beneficiary \ncouncils  and  successful  local  contractors  will  sign  model  Project  contracts  and  payment \nschedules provided by the PTC. (Supplementary Appendix A provides an overview of the \nimplementation of subcomponent 1-1.) \n \n51.  Procurement of all equipment will be managed by DoLA and the PTC in accordance with \nthe ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Regulation on Financial Management (including bulk \nprocurement of equipment).  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n52.  A total of 188 person-months of TA will be required: 56 person-months of international \n(30%) and 132 person-months of local TA (70%). Consultants recruited under component 2 will \nbe recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method. Consultants recruited under \nother components will be recruited through an individual, competitive selection (section IV, TA; \noutline TORs are in Appendix 5). All international and domestic consultants funded by grants \nexpected from Sida and the Government of the Netherlands will be procured in accordance with \nADB procedures for grant-funded projects. Advance action to recruit consultants was approved \nat the MRM in August 2002. The full list of contract packages is in Appendix 9. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n53.   The funds from ADB will be deposited into an imprest account held at the National Bank \nof Cambodia. It will delegate management of this account to the project director and project \nmanager, with support from the local consultant accountant attached to the PTC within DoLA. All \nProject finance will be disbursed through this account, with the exception of international and \nlocal  TA,  which  will  be  directly  procured  by  ADB  and  disbursed  through  standard  ADB \narrangements. The initial ceiling of imprest advance will be based on 6 months' estimated \nexpenditure, not to exceed $1,000,000. The statement-of-expenditure (SOE) procedure will be \nfollowed for all individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000. \n \n54.   Supplementary Appendix A provides an overview of the implementation arrangements \nfor subcomponents 1-1 and 1-2, including financial disbursement and reporting arrangements.10 \nFor  subcomponent  1-1,  the  ADB  imprest  advance  will  include  the  6-month  budget  for  all \ncommunes in the participating provinces. When MEF and DoLA have received the commune \nbudgets and budget amendments for each provincial batch of communes, MoI will request MEF \nto  authorize  the  National  Treasury  to  transfer  the  whole  subsidy  for  that  province  to  the \nprovincial treasury as block grants for each commune. \n \n55.   Disbursement by the Provincial Treasury to contractors selected to provide commune \nfacilities will accord with the MEF subdecree on the commune-sangkat financial management \n                                                 \n10  The  proposed  arrangements  were  selected  following  a  thorough  review  of  possible  alternatives,  including \ndisbursement arrangements under the Social Fund.  ", "14 \nsystem  and  associated  guidelines,  under  which  the  provincial  treasuries  act  as  commune \ncashiers  and/or  accountants.  The  commune  council  will  inspect  all  works  before  issuing \npayment certificates. The PTC architect and/or engineers will spot-check the quality and volume \nof works and participate in preparing the completion certificate for works in each commune \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n56.   Provincial treasuries will make payments directly to contractors, upon presentation of \npayment certificates signed by the commune chiefs. Provincial treasuries will make periodic \nSOEs to the National Treasury, which will send these on to MEF, DoLA, and PTC for ADB \nreporting and liquidation of the imprest account. \n \n57.   For component 1, subcomponents 2 and 3; and components 2, 3, and 4, disbursement \nwill be made from the imprest account to contractors and implementors, in accordance with \nADB procedures and the Project Accounting Manual. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n58.   The  project  accountant  in  the  PTC  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  all  Project \naccounts and documentation of local expenditure, and preparing and submitting quarterly and \nannual financial reports to ADB and MEF. All of these reports will require the approval of the \nproject manager (director of DoLA) and the project director (Director General, MOI). Accounting \nfor the Project will be separate from other activities of MoI. The accounting system will be in \naccordance with the Project Accounting Manual issued by MEF on 23 June 1998 under ADB \nregional technical assistance (RETA) 5689 (integrating Government and ADB requirements). \n \n59.  Supplementary Appendix A provides an overview of the procedures for subcomponent \n1-1. Provincial treasuries will submit statements of income and expenditure to the National \nTreasury,  in  accordance  with  the  MEF  subdecree  on  the  commune-sangkat  financial \nmanagement  system  and  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  Regulation  on  Financial \nManagement.  These  SOEs  will  include  payments  made  to  contractors  for  all  selected \ncommunes in the province. The National Treasury will provide the SOEs for each province \n(covering all selected communes in the province) to DoLA and the PTC accountant. The PTC \naccountant and staff will facilitate this process, including liaison and joint work with national and \nprovincial treasuries and POLAs as required. Over the life of the Project, the Government will \ndemonstrate commitment to improving treasury operations, including by providing operating \nbudgets for the provincial treasuries (Assurance 1). Under subcomponent 2-2, the Project will \nhelp build capacity of national and provincial treasuries, including through annual reviews by the \ntreasury, POLA, and DoLA staff of progress and procedures under subcomponent 1-1, as a \ncase study of the wider issue of commune financial management arrangements. \n \n60.   For  subcomponents  1-2,  1-3,  1-4,  and  for  components  2,  3,  and  4,  full  receipts, \nvouchers, and reports will be submitted to the project accountant and maintained in accordance \nwith ADB procedures. \n \n61.  External auditors acceptable to ADB will be commissioned by MEF. Audits will be carried \nout by international audit companies established in Cambodia. They will audit all accounts and \nfinancial statements annually. All audit costs will be borne by the Government. Certified copies \nof the annual audits will be submitted to ADB within 9 months after the close of each fiscal year. \n(The Government has been advised that ADB may suspend loan disbursements if the audit \nreports are not submitted within the deadline.) The external auditors will be required to audit the \nSOEs for subcomponent 1-1 and provide a separate audit opinion on these. ", "15 \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n62.   DoLA  and  the  PTC  will  draft  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on  Project \nimplementation for submission to the project manager and project director, and thence to the \nGovernment,  ADB,  Sida,  and  the  Government  of  Netherlands.  The  Project  coordinator \n(seconded to the PTC from DoLA) will take the lead in preparing these reports with assistance \nfrom PTC staff and TA. DoLA will operate a monitoring and evaluation system that reports \nimplementation progress using the indicators specified in the Project framework (Appendix 10). \nThis system will provide the basis for the Quarterly Progress Reports. \n \n63.  The quarterly and annual progress reports will be submitted to ADB and MEF within 30 \ndays of the end of each quarter. MoLMUPC, responsible for implementing component 3, and \nthe director of OoCR, responsible for implementing component 4, will provide material for the \nquarterly and annual reports to the PTC. They will be in a format acceptable to ADB and MEF \nand will include (i) full factual information on progress against target, technical and financial; (ii) \nbrief written commentary on progress against target, including a description of any problems \nencountered during the quarter; (iii) remedial measures taken or proposed; and (iv) activities \nproposed for the following quarter. These reports should also monitor the significant risk at the \npurpose level and other risks such as adequacy of budget resources to cover operations and \nmaintenance  costs,  report  on  their  occurrence  or  not  and,  if  necessary,  propose  mitigation \nmeasures.  \n \n64.   DoLA and the PTC will draft a project completion report for submission to the project \nmanager and project director. This completion report will be submitted to ADB not later than 3 \nmonths following the physical completion of the Project. \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n65.   Six months after the Project start-up, ADB will assess MoI\u2019s accounting and record-\nkeeping system, the treasury transfer and SOE system, and imprest account arrangements. \n \n66.  Twelve months after Project start-up, a project review mission will be initiated. This \nmission is expected to be in February 2004, and will (i) identify changes since the time of loan \nappraisal, (ii) assess implementation performance, (iii) review compliance with loan covenants, \n(iv) identify problems and constraints, and (v) make recommendations accordingly. The mission \nwill make recommendations on the use and allocation of the contingencies budget line. The \nreview team will include the Government, ADB, Sida, and the Government of Netherlands \nrepresentatives. Two months of international and 2 months of local TA have been budgeted to \nsupport the project review. In the last 3 months of the Project, all Project partners will undertake \nan end-of-project review mission. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n67.  TA will be financed through grant cofinancing expected from Sida and the Government \nof Netherlands, to ensure sound procurement and utilization of all works and goods, and to \nprovide  technical  support  to  CB  analysis,  organizational  development  and  training,  mass \nawareness campaign, photomapping, and civil registration. The total cost of the TA is estimated \nat $1.26 million, comprising a foreign exchange cost of $1.16 million and a local currency cost of \n$100,000 equivalent. The TA will be implemented over 36 months. The Executing Agency will \nbe DoLA. A firm will be recruited to undertake component 2. Individual consultants will be \nrecruited for other components and for all local TA. Since consultants will be financed through ", "16 \ngrant cofinancing, consultant selection will be by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers. A total of 56 person-months of international \nTA will be required as follows:  \n \nComponent 1: facilities architect           12 person-months \nComponent 2: decentralization policy, training,  \nand media specialists         30 person-months \nComponent 3: GIS and digital mapping specialist       5 person-months \nComponent 4: civil registration specialist         9 person-months \n \n68.  A total of 132 person-months of local TA will be required for the PTC as follows: \n \nAccountant              36 person-months \n4 architects and/or engineers (24 person-months each)  96 person-months \n \n69.  For the project review, 2 months of international and 2 months of local TA have been \nbudgeted. Outline TORs for all international and local TA positions are in Appendix 5. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n70.  The  decision  to  hold  commune-sangkat  council  elections  in  February  2002  was \nannounced just a year in advance, and despite remarkable progress by the Government in \nputting the basic legal framework and administrative structure in place, much work remains to \nbe done to establish the procedural and physical foundation for democratic local government. \n \n71.   The  benefit  of  providing  and  upgrading  commune  council  and  provincial  working \nfacilities  (component  1)  is  that  elected  commune-sangkat  councils,  and  the  provincial \ndepartments that support them, will be able to function. At least 440 poor rural communes that \nhave no or very poor facilities will have a modest but distinctive roofed area suitable for large \nmeetings, and four offices, sufficient for small meetings and for the council clerk to ensure \nsafekeeping of council documents, civil registration and procurement records, cash, and council \nequipment. With local adaptation of standard designs, these \u201clocal parliaments\u201d will help to \nengender civic pride and support for the councils, and for the democratic process on which they \nare founded. The radios and motorcycles provided will enable councils to communicate with \ndistrict  and  provincial  departments  of  planning,  finance,  and  local  administration,  which  is \nessential in implementing the recently issued legal procedures determining council operations. \nA commune council motorcycle will also facilitate communication between councilors and the \nvillages and constituents they represent. Commune councils will be responsible for budgeting, \nplanning, managing, and supervising the procurement of their new facilities. This provision will \nreinforce the councils' capacity and role as implementors, as the Seila Program did for local \ndevelopment works. Local procurement of buildings and furniture will bring immediate benefit to \nresidents by creating new labor opportunities in the selected communes. A commune meeting \nplace will be of benefit to other service-delivery activities in education, primary health, and land, \nand will be available for community organization use. \n \n72.  In component 2, the benefit of the training fund is that it will enable NCSC annual \ntraining work plans to be implemented, including initial and refresher training for councilors, \nclerks, and officials in all decentralization systems and procedures, including council powers \nand  functions,  clerk  duties,  provincial  line  department  roles,  planning,  local  development, \nprocurement, and financial management. The development of the NCSC ATPs will include ", "17 \ncareful attention to the particular training needs of women and ethnic minority councilors and \nprovincial/district staff, to ensure that they benefit equally from the courses and modules offered. \n \n73.  The three year mass media campaign will benefit the whole population by introducing \nand  reinforcing  essential  democratic  concepts,  including  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of \ncitizens, councilors, and officers. The 2002 local elections were not preceded by awareness \nraising on the role of councilors in representing their constituents; the respective roles and \nresponsibilities of councilors and the clerk, the relationship between the chief and other council \nmembers, the appropriate role of political parties, or the relationship between the council and \nprovincial line departments. Critical concepts such as legitimate opposition and voluntarism in \nlocal council operations are not yet clearly defined and embedded in people\u2019s minds. The mass \nmedia campaign will help deepen the understanding of democracy and local government by \naddressing all these issues over three years. The population will benefit from the information \nprovided about the role of local councils in relation to service delivery, local development, and \nthe  role  of  councils  in  giving  voice  to  local  views  about  the  services  provided  by  line \ndepartments.  The  campaign  will  help  embed  understanding  about  council  roles  in  land, \neducation,  and  future  devolved  areas  of  service.  The  campaign  will  also  be  an  important \ncomplement to the training program by reaching councilors and officials as well as ordinary \ncitizens. \n \n74.  The  TA  provided  under  component  2  will  benefit  DoLA,  NCSC,  and,  thus,  the \ndecentralization process as a whole by further developing the legal and procedural framework \nfor decentralization, ensuring the efficient implementation of the training and mass media funds \nprovided; and strengthening liaison with major service ministries to pilot new service functions \nand service roles to be devolved to commune-sangkat councils. \n \n75.  The numerous land-related problems must be solved to reduce poverty and promote \nsustainable development. The first benefit of component 3, as part of the joint-donor-assisted \northophoto mapping initiative for the whole country, is that commune-sangkat councils will \nobtain the essential visual maps they require for the councils' roles in land-use planning, land \nadministration and information, allocation of building permits, natural resource management, \nand demarcation of village and commune boundaries. Information entered onto the maps can \nbe rapidly transferred to the digital database to enable legal registration of land boundaries, \ntogether with associated information. The second benefit is that the digital orthophotos will form \npart  of  a  harmonized  national  data  infrastructure  for  land,  which  is  important  for  several \nministries and service sectors. MoLMUPC intends to make a land information system linking the \ngraphical  information  of  the  digital  orthophotos  with  statistical  and  possibly  ownership \ninformation available as maps or in digital format from MoLMUPC\u2019s General Department of \nCadastre and Geography. The third benefit is that the component will facilitate the latter stages \nof the commune boundary review. Once the NCSC boundaries and urbanization subcommittee \nhas enabled a process to determine the kind of communes and sangkats Cambodia wants for \nthe  future,  and  the  boundary  realignments  have  been  prepared,  the  orthophoto  maps  will \nprovide a ready means of finalizing and registering the new commune boundaries. \n \n76.  The establishment of an efficient, comprehensive civil registration system will benefit \nhouseholds by providing them with the documentation to prove citizenship; place of origin; \nparentage;  age;  marital  status;  inheritance;  and  entitlement  to  land,  property,  and  voter \nregistration. Women particularly benefit from the legal foundation for marriage, divorce, property \nrights, inheritance, and parentage. The system will benefit (i) children by establishing age, \nparentage,  and  place  of  origin,  and  by  enabling  enforcement  of  child-labor  laws;  (ii) \norganizations by improving information about employees, individual suppliers, and customers; ", "18 \nand  (iii)  the  nation  by  regularizing  information  on  citizenship  and  improving  demographic \ninformation flow. The provision of typewriters and secure fire-proof steel cupboards/safes to all \ncommunes  and  districts,  and  computers  to  provincial  offices  of  general  affairs  through \ncomponent 4 will benefit all council and provincial support activities. \n \nA.  Impacts \n \n77.  Local government\u2019s role in local development, managing local affairs, and mediating \nlocal disputes will become more significant. The voice of the people, through their elected \nrepresentatives, on matters such as the quality of services provided by line departments will be \nmore apparent, and service delivery by local councils will be better attuned to local needs and \npreferences. An efficient modern civil registration system will establish a key element of the \nnational institutional infrastructure on which individual contracts, exchanges, entitlements, and \ntheir enforcement depend. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n78.  The output level risks are moderate. The provision of council facilities and equipment \nprocurement is low risk. The Seila Program has shown that communes are able to procure and \ncomplete  simple  buildings  to  acceptable  standards.  Training  for  councilors  and  officials  is \nongoing  and  several  agencies  in  Cambodia  are  experienced  in  preparing  mass  media \ninformation and procuring airtime. The technology and methodology for component 3 are proven \nand  have  been  successfully  piloted,  including  commune-level  meetings  where  people  use \northophoto maps to identify local land uses and ownership. However, three other types of risk at \nthe output level should be noted. First, CB TA may fail to improve performance of government \nofficials and organizational units.11 The Project will thus systematically define official functions, \nassess initial capacity to carry out these functions, provide CB assistance, assess improved \nfunctional capacities, undertake annual reviews, and improve the process based on lessons \nlearned. A second and related risk is that the PTC and other mechanisms may become parallel \nsystems that bypass government structures and put priority on reporting to ADB rather than to \nthe Government. Thus, for the first time an ADB project provides that loan funds be disbursed \nthrough and accounted back through the provincial treasury system, and helps ensure that \ncapacities are strengthened while the Project is implemented. A third risk is that this Project will \nbe ADB\u2019s first focusing on capacity development of rural local government, and that ADB staff \nwill not have the experience to supervise the Project effectively. The Project has addressed this \nrisk by drawing on the experience of similar projects funded by other donors in other countries, \nand by providing an important role for specialist consultants experienced in working on such \nprojects. \n \n79.  The most significant risk is at the purpose level (linking achievement of project purpose \nto that of the project goal), and therefore, by definition, outside the control of the Project. This \nrisk is the familiar internationally established fact that no automatic relationship exists between \ndecentralization and improved participation, equity, growth, and, thus, poverty reduction. Even if \nthe Project is entirely successful, and communes and provinces have the facilities, systems, \ntraining, and awareness required for local democratic systems to function, several contingent \nfactors  remain,  determining  whether  or  not  the  result  will  be  increased  participation, \ntransparency, efficiency of resource allocation, quality of service delivery, and, thus, poverty \n                                                 \n11 Godfrey,  Chan  Sophal,  Toshiyasu  Kato,  Long  Vou  Piseth,  Pon  Dorina,  Tep  Saravy,  Tia  Savora  and  So \nSovannarith.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  and  Capacity  Development  in  an  Aid-dependent  Economy:  The \nExperience of Cambodia, World Development. ", "19 \nreduction.  Elements  such  as  a  malfunctioning  democratic  process,  enduring  patronage \nrelationships, a weak legal system and judiciary, and rent-seeking or interference by provincial \nofficials reduce the potential poverty-reducing benefits offered by local democracy. This risk is \nsignificant  in  a  country  that  has  been  through  acute  recent  trauma,  where  the  history  of \nmultiparty  democracy  is  relatively  short,  and  where  poverty  and  a  long  history  of  weak \ninstitutions have led to rent-seeking behavior as the norm. However, reasons for optimism do \nexist:  \n(i)  The  Government,  from  the  highest  level,  has  authentic  commitment  to \ndecentralization  and  to  ensuring  that  the  Government  achieves  greater \naccountability and more effective poverty reduction.  \n(ii)  MoI has proven commitment to advancing decentralization and has achieved \ncommendable progress in many areas, including preparing and negotiating many \nitems  of  decentralization  and  civil  registration  legislation  despite  acutely \nconstrained resources and little external assistance.  \n(iii)   The 2002 local elections engendered a high degree of participation and interest, \nand the results were generally accepted.  \n(iv)  Decentralization now has firm support from across the donor community.  \n \nC.  Cost Effectiveness \n \n80.  The creation of commune facilities at an estimated average cost of $14,000 each is \nmore cost-effective than that under other schemes and projects.12 Training activities financed by \nthe training fund (subcomponent 2-1) and under component 4 will build on the success of the \n2002 councilor training program, which reached about 14,000 people in a highly cost-effective \nmanner. The mass media campaign (subcomponent 2-2 and component 4) will be procured \nthrough  competitive  bidding  among  local  agencies  with  proven  media  expertise.  The \nmethodology of using orthophotos as the basis of land allocation and planning has proven to be \nhighly cost-effective compared to traditional ground-based global positioning system (GPS). \n \nD.  Overall Assessment \n \n81.   The Project significantly supports governance reform in Cambodia. Democratic local \ngovernment  offers  a  valuable  complement  to  other  national  governance  and  public \nadministration  reforms  designed  to  increase  accountability  and  transparency  and  reduce \nabuses. The Project is a significant addition to the support offered by other donors to the \ndecentralization  program  and  reinforces  the  commitment  by  all  sides  to  ensure  that \ndecentralization  achieves  a  real  and  sustainable  impact  on  governance,  on  strengthening \nnational institutions, and, over time, on the lives of the poor. \n \n                                                 \n12 The cost-effectiveness assessment is based on the following design features: a least-cost approach provides for a \nreinforced concrete slab of about 150 square meters (m2) (rather than backfill with a thin cement screed, to \npromote quality and life) and a traditional-style slate pitched roof (appropriate for the \"local parliament,\" rather than \nthe simple roof used for schools) plus four offices, each around 20 sq.m., at around $12,000 total (or around $80 \nper sq.m.) plus around $2,000 for site development, furniture, fittings, covered notice board, and brick safe. In \nflood-prone areas, stilt construction will be required, with some modification of dimensions and costs. At 2002 \nprices, this compares favorably with primary schools, constructed to normal school standards, during 1999-2001 \n(with European Union support) at an average $83 per sq.m. for cost of works (contractor costs only, excluding \ndesign, management, and other overheads.)  \n ", "20 \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n82.  MEF will ensure the timely disbursement of appropriate funds to the provincial treasuries \nduring the Project period.  \n \n83.  From their own resources, MoI, MoLMUPC, provinces, districts, and commune-sangkat \ncouncils meet recurrent costs of all equipment and vehicles supplied under the Project. \n \n84.  The MoI will ensure that (i) all activities are consistent with ADB policies on indigenous \npeoples; (ii) facilities provision, training, mass media, and civil registration activities will be \nadapted to meet the particular needs of areas with large ethnic minority populations; and (iii) \npeople with or without land titles will not be displaced as a result of building or rehabilitating \ncommune facilities. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n85.  Establishment, staffing, and start-up of the PTC will be completed. \n  \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n86.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 7,577,000 to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Commune Council Development Project, from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of thirty-\ntwo years, including a grace period of eight years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board; \n \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof  $3,000,000  to  the  Government  of  Cambodia  for  the  Commune  Council \nDevelopment  Project  expected  to  be  provided  by  the  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency (Sida) on a grant basis; and  \n \n(iii)  the administration by ADB of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof  $2,400,000  to  the  Government  of  Cambodia  for  the  Commune  Council \nDevelopment  Project  expected  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands on a grant basis.   \n \n \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n11 November 2002", "  Appendix 1  21 \nDECENTRALIZATION IN CAMBODIA \n \n1.  During  2001\u201302,  decentralization  was  the  fastest-moving  area  of  governance  and \nadministrative  reform  in  Cambodia.  Decentralization  and  the  election  of  1,621  commune-\nsangkat councils in February 2002 has created a new tier of governance, founded on popular \nmandate. Formerly appointed, the commune chief is now the leader of an elected multiparty \ncouncil with 5\u201311 members. \n \n2.  As commune-sangkat councils only came into existence in early 2002, no performance \ndata  are  available.  The  key  administrative  and  council  data  are  as  follows:  Cambodia  is \norganized into 20 provinces; four municipalities; and 1,621 communes-sangkat, of which 1,510 \nare rural communes. The municipalities of Phnom Penh, Kep, Pailin, and Sihanoukville have \n111 sangkat. The number of communes per province differs substantially, from 173 in Kompong \nCham  to  21  in  Mondolkiri.  The  average  commune-sangkat  has  8,000  people:  35%  of \ncommunes-sangkat had under 5,000 people in 1998, while 20% had over 10,000. The small \naverage size of communes will be an issue during the review of commune boundaries, to be \ncompleted before the second mandate elections in 2007. \n \n3.   Of the 11,261 elected commune-sangkat councilors, 8.5% are female and an estimated \n10.2%  are  ethnic  minorities.  Facilities,  and  human  and  financial  resources  are  highly \nconstrained. With many rural roads still in very poor condition, travel to many remote communes \nremains difficult. Electricity and telephone services are similarly limited in remote areas. Each \ncouncil has one staff, the council clerk, who is a Ministry of Interior (MoI) employee. \n \n4.  The subdecree on decentralization of powers, roles, and duties to commune-sangkat \ncouncils (22/ANK/BK, 25 March 2002) further develops the role of councils first outlined in the \nLaw on Administration of Communes/Sangkat, issued in March 2001. The subdecree defines \ntwo different roles for the council: (i) \u201cpromote and facilitate the development of the commune-\nsangkat by invoking assistance, and mobilizing capacities\u201d (Article 11); and (ii) \u201cpromote and \ncoordinate the process of democracy in the commune-sangkat\u201d (Article 12). Views differ about \nhow the balance between these two roles will and should develop. Some argue that direct \ncouncil control over service delivery is the principal decentralization objective. Others argue that \nwith very small communes with limited resources, and in a country with little history of local \nparticipation and empowerment, developing the representative \u201cvoice of the people,\u201d which the \ncreation of elected councils has enabled, will be more significant in promoting development and \ngood governance. \n \n5.  The  Commune  Administration  Act  gives  councils  \u201clocal  affairs\u201d  duties  to  maintain \nsecurity  and  public  order;  manage  public  services;  promote  welfare,  economic,  and  social \ndevelopment;  protect  and  conserve  the  environment;  and  promote  tolerance  and  mutual \nunderstanding (Article 43; and Article 61, powers subdecree). However, these articles must be \nunderstood as conferring discretionary, supplementary roles on councils since they are not \nresponsible for the police, education, health, or other services and are explicitly excluded from \ninvolvement in forestry. \n \n6.  The most advanced area of council involvement in service delivery to date is in planning, \nallocating, and implementing the development portion of transfers from the Commune Fund \nunder the Seila Program. About 1,000 communes are expected to receive a Commune Fund \ndevelopment  allocation  in  2003,  for  local  infrastructure  and  other  rural  development \ninvestments. \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \n7.   Major service ministries are beginning to assess what role councils might play in service \ndelivery,  and  component  2-3  will  promote  this  assessment.  With  councils  in  their  infancy, \nhowever, and with only one clerk, conferring major service delivery responsibilities is clearly a \nlong-term project. The most significant emerging role for councils in key service provision will be \nin  implementing  the  Land  Law  2001,  including  land-use  planning,  local  resolution  of  plot \ndisputes, and monitoring illegal usages (see component 3 for the project support for this role.) \n \n8.  The act also gives councils the power to take on agency roles, delegated by the state \n(Article 42). The first agreed-upon agency role is for civil registration (component 4; Appendix \n2). The draft legislation to revise the election system, now before the National Assembly, \nproposes  to  delegate  responsibility  for  updating  voter  lists  from  the  National  Election \nCommission to the commune-sangkat councils beginning in 2003. \n \n9.  Ways to increase councils\u2019 revenue are under discussion, but for the medium term, \ntransfers will remain the most significant source of income. For 2002, the Government has \nallocated KR20 billion from the national budget to the Commune Fund. The Seila Program has \ncontributed an additional KR5.6 billion. One third of the Commune Fund is for administration, \ngiving  the  average  council  about  $1,000  in  2002.  The  remaining  two  thirds  is  for  local \ndevelopment activities in communes that have already completed commune development plans. \nFrom 2003 to 2005, the share of the national budget committed to the Commune Fund is \nplanned to increase to 2.5%, in part enabled by the World Bank Rural Infrastructure and Local \nGovernance Project, which intends to reimburse some rural development expenditures financed \nby Commune Fund transfers. At present, the provincial treasuries under Ministry of Economy \nand Finance acts as the fund holder and accountant for commune-sangkat councils. Communes \nare only entitled to manage transfers through their own bank account with the approval of the \nminister of finance. \n \n10.  The  Government\u2019s  decentralization  program  is  led  by  the  National  Committee  for \nSupport to Communes-Sangkat (NCSC), established by royal decree in 2001. NCSC is chaired \nby MoI, and includes the ministries of economy and finance; land management, urban planning, \nand construction; planning; rural development; women\u2019s and veterans affairs; and the Council of \nMinisters. NCSC has five subcommittees: council powers and functions, finance, planning, \nboundaries and urbanization, and capacity building13. The NCSC secretariat is the Department \nof Local Administration in MoI. Department of Local Administration functions and capacities are \ndescribed in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 For more details on the NCSC and its responsibilities for inter-ministerial coordination, see DoLA, \u201cSupport to \nDecentralization \u2013 Assisting the NCSC to Implement its Action Plan\u201d, October, 2001. ", "  Appendix 2  23 \nCIVIL REGISTRATION: THE RECENT HISTORY \n \n1.  During the 1970s, one consequence of the war and the Khmer Rouge period was the \ndestruction of birth, death, and marriage records, and the country\u2019s civil registration system. In \n1980,  some  districts  in  Phnom  Penh  began  to  collect  civil  records,  and  provinces  have \nprogressively introduced their own systems in recent years. As a result, civil registration is a \npatchwork of different methods; statistical aggregation is difficult; and millions of births, deaths, \nand marriages going back many years remain nonformalized. The consequences for individuals \nand organizations include difficulties in proving identity, legal birth, age, inheritance, ownership \nrights and entitlements, proof of residence, and citizenship14.  \n \n2.  On 29 December 2000, the Government adopted a new subdecree on vital registration. \nThe subdecree's 67 articles define a single national system, based on centrally produced forms, \nrecord-keeping, and statistical systems.  \n \n3.  The subdecree defines the role of civil registration as the common bond tying nationality \nwith the state, and the status of a person with his or her own family and national society, and \nestablishes  duties  and  obligations  for  that  person.  The  subdecree  defines  the  commune-\nsangkat chiefs' responsibility for local registration activity. They keep two copies of annual \nregistration books, which are sent to the district and provincial court for safekeeping at the end \nof each year. All births must be registered within 30 days; orphanages must register abandoned \nbabies. After 30 days, births must be adjudicated by the local court, prior to registration in the \ncommune-sangkat. Marriage notices are posted at the local commune-sangkat offices of both \npartners for 10 days, prior to registering and witnessing. Death certificates must be issued within \n15  days,  at  the  deceased's  normal  place  of  residence.  Any  suggestion  of  crime  must  be \nreported to the police. The birth, marriage, and death provisions all make provision for Khmer \ncitizens living outside Cambodia, and for foreign nationals living within the country. \n \n4.   The  subdecree  sets  out  a  procedure  for  validating  previously  unregistered  births, \nmarriages, and deaths, based on corroboration by two witnesses. Applicants are entitled to \nreceive letters validating birth, death, and marriage. The registration of the backlog is to be \ncompleted  within  3  years.  Then  a  court  decision  is  required  before  registration  can  be \ncompleted. Copies of certificates can be obtained from the commune-sangkat within a calendar \nyear, or from the district after the end of the year. The subdecree includes various provisions to \npromote honesty, and avoid abuse and multiple registrations. \n \n5.  On 24 June 2002, the civil registration fee rates were established by subdecree. Birth \nand  death  certificate  applications  are  free  (Article  58  of  the  December  2000  subdecree). \nMarriage certificates; letters certifying births, deaths, and marriages; and all copy forms cost \nKR400.  In  the  five  officially  poorest  provinces  (Ratanakiri,  Mondolkiri,  Stung  Treng,  Preah \nVihear, Oddar Meanchey) the rate is KR100 Riel. Marriage applications and all copy certificates \nalso require stamp fees varying from KR300\u20131,500. Although the cost of printing the books and \nforms is borne by the state budget (Article 56 of the December 2000 subdecree), Article 3 of the \nfees subdecree specifies that all revenue collected by the commune-sangkat from selling all \nkinds of civil registration will be treated as the commune-sangkat's own revenue. The delegation \n                                                 \n14 For example, at the 14 provincial women\u2019s legal rights seminars organized by the NGO Women for Prosperity \nduring 2002, participants were unanimous that the absence of civil registration records is a central handicap to \nwomen\u2019s ability to prove the existence of marriage; to pursue property rights at divorce; and to validate parentage, \nage, and right to school attendance. ", "24  Appendix 2 \nof civil registration has thus been used as an opportunity to create a modest new source of \ncommune-sangkat local income. \n \n6.   A  short  amending  subdecree,  also  issued  on  24  June  2002,  formally  establishes \ncommune-sangkat council responsibility for civil registration, and defines the 3-year period for \nclearing the unregistered backlog, without reference to a court, as 1 August 2002 to 1 August \n2005. \n \n7.  The Office of Civil Registration within the MoI Department of General Administration \nmanages the new civil registration system. Office of Civil Registration has made good progress \nin preparing for implementation. A set of 13 forms has been produced: 4 each for birth and \ndeath, and 5 for marriage. The four forms for each category are for first-time and repeat \ncertificates for historic and current life events. (The fifth form for marriage is the public notice.) \nRecord-keeping books have been produced for each of the three life-event categories. The \ncommune-sangkat clerk will maintain two copies of each record book. The forms and record \nbooks are color-coded. Each form is printed over a colored national symbol, making unlawful \nduplication difficult. A total of 20 million forms have been printed and have been distributed \nsince mid-2002.  \n \n8.  Initial training for the commune clerks in the new system was completed in early 2002, \nalthough without the benefit of an instruction manual, which is being drafted. The new system \nformally comes into operation on 1 August 2002. The intention is that councils will provide \nmonthly registration statistics to districts, and districts to provinces, and provinces will provide \nquarterly statistics to Ministry of Interior. \n \n9.  Progress has been achieved with very limited resources and without any donor support. \nAt commune, district, and provincial levels, only basic orientation training has been provided; \ncouncils and clerks have no manuals; most offices have no safekeeping facility for blank forms \nand  records;  and  all  recording  is  by  hand.  Publicizing  the  importance  of  civil  registration, \nclearing the backlog through the 3-year intensive campaign, and motivating ordinary people to \nregister are major challenges. Office of Civil Registration, with 10 staff, has had no international \nassistance  in  modern  civil  registration  methodologies  and  has  minimal  resources  and \nequipment. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  25 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY FORM \n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Yes  Sector identified as a national priority in  Yes \npoverty  analysis?

Decentralization is a priority in the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  country \nassistance strategy and plan. \n  \n \nA.  Contribution of Decentralization to Reducing Poverty in Cambodia  \n \nSupporting decentralization and the operations of the 1,621 commune-sangkat councils elected for the first time in \nFebruary 2002 offers an important opportunity to embed peace and security; strengthen accountability, transparency, \nand good governance; and promote participation and democracy. All of these will help reduce poverty, and promote \ngrowth and social development. However, decentralization and poverty reduction are not automatically linked. This \nProject will be a first ADB contribution to what will inevitably be a long-term effort of government and external funding \nagencies to ensure that implementation of decentralization is pro-poor. Indicators of government commitment to pro-\npoor decentralization are positive. Coordinated donor efforts to complement political decentralization launched by \ngovernment with the development of pro-poor administrative, fiscal, and resourcing systems will be critical to poverty \nreduction in a previously highly centralized country. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis Proposed Classification: Thematic: Good Governance. Poverty Intervention.  \n \nCambodia has extensive poverty literature, notably the Ministry of Planning\u2019s 1999 Cambodia Poverty Assessment, \nassisted by various donors. The project preparation was well informed of this literature. As part of a governance \nproject, components 2, 3, and 4 are national and systemic. The selection procedure for component 1, which accounts \nfor most project resources, will prioritize rural communes (Supplementary Appendix A), which have a significant \ndegree of poverty as measured by World Food Program poverty data. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nProject preparation included extensive stakeholder consultations with (i) commune-sangkat councils and their clerks, \n(ii) provincial and district officials, (iii) ministry officials who are members of the interministerial National Committee for \nSupport to Commune-Sangkat Councils, and (iv) donors and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) with experience \non working in different aspects of decentralization. A roundtable meeting with donors and NGOs on the preliminary \ndesign for the Project, hosted by Ministry of Interior in late May 2002, expressed clear support for the project concept \nand the selected components and implementation approach. This support has continued through the formulation \nproposal, and was also expressed by the stakeholders represented at the Appraisal Mission wrap-up meeting in \nAugust.  \n \nParticipation strategy required: No \n \nD.

Provision of radios and motorcycles will increase \nthe cost-efficiency of communication and travel, and reduce \nthe  need  for  private  financing.  The  new  national  civil \nregistration system will reduce the cost burden and difficulties \nfaced by the poor in obtaining birth, death, and marriage \ncertificates.

Many donors and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are assisting the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization program. The Seila Program and its technical assistance (TA) arm, Partnership \nfor Local Governance, are the largest and most significant source of support to decentralization. \nThe  Seila  Program  has  helped  shape  thinking  around  decentralization  and  formulate  the \nemerging  legal  framework  for  council  operations.  Growing  out  of  the  multidonor  Carere \nrehabilitation  program,  in  1996  the  Seila  Program  began  piloting  decentralized  and \ndeconcentrated local investment methodologies in five provinces and is now a major program \ncovering 17 rural provinces. It is executed by the interministerial Seila Task Force through a \nsecretariat of the Committee for Development of Cambodia. The Seila Program has the most \nextensive TA and provincial support network and also provides important advisory and financial \nsupport to National Committee for Support to Commune-Sangkat Councils (NCSC) ministries, \nincluding  the  Ministry  of  Interior  (MoI)  Department  of  Local  Administration  (DoLA).  Seila/ \nPartnership  for  Local  Governance  is  mainly  financed  by  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgram,  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International  Development,  and  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). The Seila Program channels resources \nfor provincial and commune-led development from World Food Program, International Fund for \nAgricultural  Development,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  and  Danish  International \nDevelopment Assistance (Danida) . The two-third share of the Commune Fund for development \nactivities  is  now  the  principal  Seila  Program  financing  channel  for  local  development \ninvestments. The World Bank\u2019s $23 million Rural Investment and Local Governance Project, \nexpected to be approved in autumn 2002, significantly finances council development through \nreimbursement of Commune Fund expenditures. The Project will complement the decentralized \naspect  of  Seila  Program  activities  by  (i)  strengthening  facilities,  equipment,  and \ncommunications; (ii) undertaking systems development and councilor and government staff and \ntraining;  and  (iii)  increasing  popular  awareness  of  elected  local  government  roles  and \nresponsibilities. \n \n2.  The  Government  of  Germany,  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical Cooperation) (GTZ), is providing TA to DoLA \nfrom 2002 to 2004, including specialist assistance in training materials, methodologies, course \ndesign  and  implementation,  and  mapping  major  service  delivery  tiers  of  responsibility.  An \nadditional allocation of about $2.0 million, mainly to support TA, training, and capacity building, \nis expected to be agreed upon shortly. The German Government has agreed to finance this \nallocation on the understanding that the GTZ TA and resources will be deployed in close \ncooperation  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Sida,  and  the  Government  of \nNetherlands. The design and financing of component 2 of the Project assumes that the German \nGovernment will contribute to capacity building, training, and other activities. \n \n3.   GTZ is supporting decentralization in Kampong Thom and Kampot, including capacity \nbuilding and training for councilors and staff in the provinces and districts. GTZ also provides \nthe principal TA to the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction, which \nis responsible for implementing the Land Law 2001, and which chairs the NCSC\u2019s boundaries \nand urbanization subcommittee. The GTZ TA to Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, \nand Construction will support the implementation of component 3 of this Project. \n \n4.   The Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAF) has an ongoing program of short-term TA \neducational inputs to MoI, Council for Administrative Reform, and the Council of Ministers. In \nconjunction with the Asia-Urbs program of the European Union (EU), KAF is supporting pilot \napproaches to urban governance, including twinning the towns of Battambang and Siem Riep ", "28  Appendix 4 \nwith European cities. KAF is financing production and promulgation of new commune-sangkat \nlegislation, and training political parties in concepts of democratic local government. KAF has \nalso planned to initiate a national federation of commune-sangkat councils.  \n \n5.  The UNDP, through Project CMB/01/004 (2001\u201305) supported the National Electoral \nCommission with voter registration and organization of the commune elections. This project also \nfinances the TA provided through the Decentralization Support Program to DoLA, and the TA to \nthe Ministry of Economy and Finance for fiscal decentralization, financial management, and \nprocurement regulations and procedures.  \n \n6.  The EU provided substantial financial support to the local elections in February 2002. EU \nis working with KAF on urban issues through Asia-Urbs. A substantial program of EU support to \ndecentralization is expected to be identified in late 2002. \n \n7.   The Government of France will be formulating a TA project in September-October 2002 \nto  support  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  in  fiscal  decentralization,  including  the \nprovince-commune relationship and local revenue raising. TA formulation will consider the role \nof NCSC and DoLA in local government financing systems. France will also support further work \non deconcentration through the Council for Administrative Reform under its forthcoming civil \nservice modernization project. \n \n8.   A group of leading NGOs has formed the Commune Council Support Project (CCSP), \nhosted by International Cooperation for Development and Solidarity to mobilize NGO support for \ndecentralization. The CCSP Bulletin is already an important source of information for the NGO \ncommunity and others about decentralization progress. In September 2002, NCSC is expected \nto approve the establishment of a CCSP liaison office (financed by the Seila Program) within \nDoLA. \n \n9.  About 50 NGOs have assisted in the 2002 program of orientation training of councilors. \nThe Cambodia Institute of Human Rights, financed by the Government of New Zealand, has \ntrained councilors and council clerks.  \n \n10.  Sida and Department for International Development (UK) are financing a longitudinal \nresearch study of the implementation and impact of decentralization, managed by the Cambodia \nDevelopment Research Institute. \n \n11.   Several countries, including Germany, Japan, Philippines, Sweden, and United States, \nhave  invited  key  officials  of  MoI,  DoLA,  and  other  NCSC  ministries  to  participate  in \ndecentralization-related study tours. \n \n12.  During 2001, ADB provided support to DoLA to help prepare the first NCSC work plan \n(in association with GTZ), and to prepare a roadmap for the major policy and implementation \nmeasures to be achieved during the first mandate. In late 2001, ADB sought to strengthen \nliaison  between  DoLA  and  funding  agencies  by  beginning  to  host  donor  decentralization \nroundtable  meetings  at  the  ADB  Cambodia  Resident  Mission.  With  more  TA  and  support \navailable to DoLA from various sources, responsibility for calling these meetings moved to DoLA \nin May 2002. The preparation of this loan, associated TA inputs, and resourcing to DoLA were \nsupported  through  TA  3836-CAM:  Preparing  the  Decentralization  Support  Program,  for \n$500,000, approved on 15 February, 2002. \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  29 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n \nA.  The Commune Council Development Project \n \n1.  Decentralization is one of the most significant areas of progress in public administration \nand  governance  reform  in  Cambodia.  Its  first  local  elections  for  1,621  commune-sangkat \ncouncils were held on 3 February 2002. The election process was generally agreed to have \nbeen free and fair, and the outcome was broadly accepted in the country. Decentralization is an \nauthentically government-driven initiative, and substantial resources have been committed from \nthe national budget to finance the elections and commune resources. Several funding agencies \nand nongovernment organizations are now backing the Government\u2019s decentralization initiative. \n \n2.  The Commune Council Development Project (CCDP) is a significant contribution to this \nmultidonor support effort. The CCDP is a $17.4-million project implemented in 2003 to 2005. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  contributing  $10  million;  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency is expected to contribute $3 million; the Government of the \nNetherlands is expected to contribute $2.4 million; Government of Cambodia $2 million in kind. \nThe  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  provide  most  commune-sangkat  councils  with  facilities, \nequipment,  systems,  training,  popular  understanding,  and  support  required  to  function \neffectively. \n \n3.  The CCDP has four components: \n \n(i)  Component  1:  Commune  Facilities.  Construction,  rehabilitation,  furnishing  for \ncommune-sangkat councils of about 440 commune facilities; provision of about \n1,000 radios and/or cellular phones; and about 580 motorcycles to commune-\nsangkat councils; and modest support to provincial facilities. \n(ii)  Component 2: Capacity  Building.  Training  for  councilors,  clerks,  and  officers; \nmass media public awareness campaign; international technical assistance (TA) \nfor component 2; and further policy and legal development and piloting of major \nservice decentralization. \n(iii)  Component 3: Commune-Sangkat Photomapping. National aerial photography, \nleading to production of commune orthophoto maps, as part of a multidonor \nprogram with the Ministry of Land. \n(iv)   Component 4: Civil  Registration.  TA,  training,  and  equipment  to  establish  an \nefficient modern civil registration system for births, deaths, and marriages.  \n \n4.   The CCDP is executed by the Ministry of Interior (MoI) through its Directorate General \nAdministration and Department of Local Administration (DoLA). DoLA is the secretariat of the \ninterministerial  National  Council  for  Support  to  Communes  (NCSC),  which  guides  and \nimplements decentralization. A temporary project technical cell (PTC) staffed by DoLA officials \nand consultants will help implement the Project. \n \n5.  Since  consultancy  services  are  expected  to  be  funded  by  grant  cofinancing  from \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the Government of Netherlands, \nthese  services  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB  procurement  and  contracting \nprocedures for grant-funded TA.

OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATION: ORGANIZATIONAL ASSESSMENT \n \n1.  The  Department  of  Local  Administration  (DoLA)  of  the  Ministry  of  Interior  was \nestablished in mid-2001. The DoLA office is in the main MoI compound in Phnom Penh, with \neasy access to the director general of the Department of General Administration, secretary of \nstate, and ministers. All DoLA staff work in the same building. \n \n2.  By August 2002, DoLA had 39 staff. The director is a widely respected former governor \nof Siem Reap Province. Unlike most government employees, DoLA staff are young\uf8e7in their late \n20s\u2014and well educated. Two staff have masters degrees; 25 have bachelors degrees (22 from \nthe Faculty of Law at Phnom Penh University, one from the Faculty of Literature, and one from \nthe Royal School of Public Administration); and 9 have higher secondary certificates. Only one \nstaff  is  female  (and  training  in  Australia).  DoLA  intends  to  recruit  more  female  staff,  and \nrecruiting more males is banned.  \n \n3.  DoLA is organized into six offices: (i) administration; (ii) finance; (iii) capacity building, \ntraining and education; (iv) planning, statistics, and information; (v) monitoring and evaluation; \nand (vi) research. A deputy director heads each office. Interoffice cooperation is good.  \n \n4.   Three  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  offices  (financed  by  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German \nAgency for Technical Cooperation), and the Seila Program) have been established in DoLA. \nThe Commune Council Support Project (the nongovernment organization federation supporting \ndecentralization) will establish a liaison office in DoLA in the latter part of 2002.  \n \n5.  Following  the  completion  of  the  major  program  of  councilor  and  officer  orientation \ntraining in mid-2002 (covering commune-sangkat council administration, planning, and financial \nprocedures), which occupied most DoLA staff at different times from March to July 2002, DoLA \nwork priorities include (i) evaluating the impact of the initial training program; (ii) establishing the \nstructure, functions, procedures, and resourcing of the provincial offices of local administration \n(POLAs); (iii) preparing radio-TV items for broadcast; (iv) organizing the 2002 second-tranche \nCommune Fund transfer; and (v) planning the 2003 Commune Fund allocation. The review of \nexisting decentralization legislation and procedures and the preparation of new items, and \norganizational and secretariat functions for meetings of the National Committee for Support to \nCommune-Sangkat Councils (NCSC) and its subcommittees are ongoing tasks. \n \n6.   DoLA is preparing a work plan that addresses the major outputs and tasks required to \nembed  decentralization  over  the  first  mandate.  Following  TA  in  conceptualizing  the  work-\nplanning process and designing formats, the work plan preparation has been led by DoLA, \ninvolving all six DoLA offices and staff. Following translation, the work plan will be subject to \nwider discussion. The intention is that, as well as providing the means of planning and tracking \nthe activities of DoLA offices and staff, the work plan will provide the overall framework for co-\ncoordinating DoLA TA inputs; determining NCSC policymaking priorities and timescales over \nthe first mandate; and identifying unmet resourcing needs for decentralization. The ministry and \nTA units in DoLA are committed to avoiding the organizational fragmentation and capacity \ndraining  that  have  occurred  in  other  government  ministries  and  departments,  which  have \nbalkanized around different externally funded project activities. The work plan will provide a \npractical,  transparent,  and  government-determined  framework  for  DoLA  activities,  for  the \ndecentralization program as a whole, and for co-coordinating donor resourcing and TA activity.  \n ", "  Appendix 7  41 \n7.  The DoLA equipment and the recurrent operating budget is very limited. Operating costs \nare minimal for travel and communications; meetings, seminars, and training; materials and \nmaintenance; and print, publications, and translation. In practice, most activities depend on \nsupport from the various TA providers15. Some staff receive modest salary supplements through \nTA support, and these are pooled by all DoLA staff.  \n \n8.  In August 2002, POLAs were established under the office of the governor in all 24 \nprovinces and municipalities. An official complement of 29 POLA staff exists. Accommodation, \nequipment, and official operating budgets are very limited. However, most POLA offices and \nstaff are assisted by local project activities, notably through the Seila Program, which rapidly \naccommodated  the  creation  of  POLAs  in  the  multisectoral  Provincial  Rural  Development \nCommittee  and  Executive  Committee.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme \nDecentralization Support Program is reviewing means of increasing support to the POLAs and \ncouncils  in  the  seven  provinces  and  municipalities  not  included  under  the  Seila  Program. \nDeveloping the organization, staffing, resourcing, and role of the POLAs is a priority for DoLA. \n \n9.  DoLA is an atypical government department. First, it is new, with young, relatively well-\neducated staff. It is well led and has close and easy contact with senior decision makers. \nSecond, it is the implementing agency for a program, which has authentic government support \nand commitment. DoLA was created explicitly to implement the Government\u2019s decentralization \nprogram and to act as secretariat to NCSC. That objective-oriented raison d\u2019etre is clearly \napparent in DoLA\u2019s day-to-day activities and performance.  \n \n10.  DoLA staff lack the experience of more seasoned civil servants. However, the evidence \nof DoLA\u2019s achievements over its first year\uf8e7notably in preparing, negotiating, and issuing the \ninitial decentralization legislation and organizing nationwide three-course training for 13,000 \npeople\u2014strongly indicates that this lack is fully compensated by the youth, motivation, and \neducation of DoLA staff, and the leadership and commitment of the director and the director \ngeneral.  \n \n11.  To implement the Project, DoLA has only one qualified architect, and has no experience \nin Asian Development Bank (ADB) financial procedures or reporting requirements16. The project \ntechnical cell (PTC), including one international and four national architect and/or engineers and \none national consultant experienced in ADB financial procedures, will bring these missing skills \nand experience into DoLA for the duration of the Project. The five DoLA staff attached to the \nPTC had preliminary training in ADB procedures in 2002, and will start additional English-\nlanguage  training  in  September  2002.  Three  have  helped  prepare  this  report  and \nrecommendation of the president. All five are bright, young, motivated people, with a good \nworking relationship with the DoLA director and Director General, Ministry of Interior (the project \nmanager and project director, respectively), and they and the PTC will no doubt make up an \neffective management, implementation, and reporting team for the Project.  \n \n                                                 \n15 The 2002 ADB project preparatory technical assistance is providing a range of support, including a telephone \nnetwork; computer equipment; furniture; training; seminar and translation costs; and a library, record-keeping, and \nreception area. The equipment provided under the project preparatory technical assistance will be available for use \nby the project technical cell, and no additional office equipment (other than three vehicles) is budgeted under the \nProject. \n16 For more details on financial management capacity of DoLA, provincial treasuries, and commune councils, see \nADB. 2002. \u201cFinancial Management Assessment of Executing Agencies\u201d.
