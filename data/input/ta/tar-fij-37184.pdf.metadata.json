In  April  2004,  during  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  Mission,  the \nGovernment of the Fiji Islands requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance \n(TA) to prepare the Fourth Road Upgrading (Sector) Project (FRUP IV). The ADB Fact-Finding \nMission visited the Fiji Islands from 30 August to 3 September 2004 and reached an agreement \nwith  the  Government  on  the  rationale,  objective,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. The TA design is \nbased on the Mission's discussions with the Government; observations in the field; and a review \nof data, studies, and reports. The preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Fiji Islands comprise 330 islands scattered over 150,000 square kilometers in the \nSouth Pacific Ocean. About 100 of the islands are inhabited and about 75% of the population of \n800,000 lives on the main island of Viti Levu, where road transport is important in supporting \neconomic development. Road transport is also important on other islands to promote balanced \ndevelopment of remote communities.  \n \n3.  The majority of the Fiji Islands' infrastructure facilities was built between the mid-1960s \nand mid-1980s, but since that time chronic lack of investment has had an impact on growth \ntargets.2 Although the country\u2019s road network is extensive, with over 5,000 kilometers (km) of \nroads (about 20% are sealed), maintenance remains a constant challenge. The Government \nrecognizes that roads are vital for intra-island communication to support agriculture, forestry, \nand tourism. A major rehabilitation and upgrading program was initiated in the mid-1980s, \nsupported by ADB, World Bank, and several other international agencies. Currently the Third \n[Fiji] Road Upgrading Project (FRUP III)3 is under implementation.  \n \n4.  The Public Works Department (PWD) within the Ministry of Works and Energy (MWE) is \nresponsible for administration of the national roads network under the Roads Act. Its role is \nprincipally  road  construction,  maintenance,  and  upgrading  of  both  public  roads  and  roads \ncontrolled by other ministries. PWD is being restructured (para. 7), and currently employs about \n2,000 people to manage, maintain, and upgrade the road network. \n \n5.  Approximately 78,000 road vehicles are registered in the country; about half are private \ncars. This number has increased at almost 10% per year in recent years as a result of the \nimport of secondhand vehicles. Buses and taxis provide extensive services and are entirely \ncommercially operated. Heavy road vehicles are limited to 30.8 tons gross weight and 8 ton axle \nloads\u2014low by international standards\u2014but adherence to the restrictions is poor. Vehicle length \nlimits of 10 meters limit the use of long articulated vehicles. Trucks are frequently overloaded, \nhauling sugarcane during harvest. Overloaded construction and logging trucks create the most \ndamage, contributing to damage pavement and high road accident and fatality rates. \n \n6.  Road transport is administered through the Land Transport Authority (LTA) under the \nTraffic Act.4 LTA undertakes vehicle registration, testing, and driver licensing, as well as traffic \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 2 September 2004. \n2   ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132007: Fiji Islands. Manila. \n3  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the Third Road Upgrading (Sector) Project. \nManila. (Loan No. 1530-FIJ for $40 million, and TA No. 2850-FIJ).  \n4  See footnote 3. The attached TA No. 2850-FIJ funded establishment of LTA, reorganization of PWD and capacity \nbuilding of stakeholders to implement the Fiji Road Safety Action Plan. \n ", "2  \nmanagement and enforcement of regulations. As of December 2003, LTA employed 234 staff \ndistributed among 15 offices throughout the country. Enforcement of loading restrictions and \nvehicle condition has improved since establishment of the LTA, but more remains to be done. \n \n7.  According to National Transport Safety Council statistics, 1,201 motor vehicle fatalities \nwere recorded in the past 15 years. Speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol, fatigue, \nand poor eyesight were the main causes. Largely as a result of the Fiji Road Safety Action Plan \n(footnote 4), over the last 8 years the Fiji Islands has been very successful at reducing the rate \nof accidents. The overall vehicle accident rate decreased by 24% during 1995\u20132003; while \nlicensed vehicles increased by over 40%. Fiji Police statistics report that fatal traffic accidents \nhave been reduced from about 16.4 deaths per 1,000 vehicles in 1994 to 10 deaths per 1,000 \nvehicles in 2003 with a low of 8 in 2002. Much work remains if the National Transport Safety \nCouncil target of 5 deaths per 1,000 vehicles by the end of 2005 is to be met. \n \n8.  FRUP III (footnote 4) is providing financing for civil works for upgrading about 100 km of \ngravel roads selected from 19 roads identified, rehabilitation and strengthening of about 80 km \nof  existing  sealed  roads,  civil  works  for  road  safety  improvements,  specialized  road \nmaintenance and laboratory equipment, and consulting services. The attached TA is providing \n(i) policy and institutional reform by establishing and supporting LTA, and devolving PWD roads \nto  a  statutory  commercial  authority;  (ii)  enhanced  capacity  to  manage  road  assets  by \nestablishing a road asset management system; and (iii) support of phase II of the Fiji Road \nSafety Action Plan. The Government plans to continue these activities as outlined in the 20-year \nprogram of the National Transport Sector Plan (NTSP),5 which was reviewed and updated in \n2004. Progress on all components under FRUP III has been satisfactory except for a major \ninternational competitive bidding contract to upgrade 50 km of the Kings-Lodoni Road, which is \nunlikely to be completed before scheduled loan closing on 31 December 2005.6 \n \n9.  Under the Government's Public Sector Reform Program, MWE initiated a process of \nsignificant reform to rationalize and commercialize PWD operations in line with the NTSP. This \nprocess is being undertaken in three phases (i) creating the separate Department of National \nRoads  (DNR)  to  amalgamate  all  road  functions  within  PWD,  (ii)  establishing  a  Fiji  roads \nauthority (FRA) and a road fund, and (iii) undertaking initial operations of the FRA. Phase I of \nthe reform is currently being supported under TA attached to FRUP III (footnote 4), and the \ncurrent plans are to establish the FRA by 2006. The Government has requested continuing \nassistance for phase II to prepare for the transition to the FRA.  \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  Fiji  Islands  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s \nobjectives as embodied in the Public Sector Reform Program and the NTSP. ADB\u2019s strategic \nobjectives  include  assistance  to  carry  out  institutional  and  policy  reform  based  on  greater \nmarket  orientation  and  an  enhanced  role  for  the  private  sector.  Adequate  and  efficient \ninfrastructure is a key requirement to facilitate private sector development, economic growth, \nand more equitable distribution of benefits. ADB\u2019s operational strategy identified improvement of \nphysical  infrastructure  as  a  priority  area  to  support  the  strategic  objectives,  together  with \ncomplementary assistance for rural livelihoods and outer island development. Over the medium \nterm, ADB will continue to emphasize improvement of the policy environment, and given the \nperennial shortage of skills, will place priority on human resource development and institutional \nstrengthening of key sector agencies, coupled with promotion of private sector development. \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 1992. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Fiji for the National Transport Sector Plan. Manila. (TA No. \n1715-FIJ) \n6  The delays are due to the inability of the contractor to meet the expected work program. The Government, its \nconsultants, and ADB staff are working closely with the contractor to try to resolve this situation. \n ", "  3\n \n11.  FRUP IV will finance the Government\u2019s road subsector investment program under the \nNTSP. However, given the delay in FRUP III, the Government does not want the NTSP work \nprogram to slip and will utilize funds already earmarked for the road subsector to prepare \nsubproject feasibility studies and engineering designs for FRUP IV.7 The Government has also \nrequested assistance to create an appropriate environment for public-private partnerships to \nfinance infrastructure development and operations, and to promote public-private partnerships \nin the transport sector. The TA to prepare FRUP IV, with substantial financial input from the \nGovernment, will enhance ADB\u2019s longstanding partnership with the Government in developing \nthe transport sector, providing balanced regional development, and reducing poverty. \n \nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  prepare  an  investment  project  to  ensure  that  future \ninvestment in the road subsector is effective; will contribute to an efficient transport sector as a \nwhole; and will support the Government's objectives of balanced regional development, poverty \nreduction, and private sector endeavors, taking account of intermodal considerations. \n \n13.  The TA will prepare a detailed feasibility study for FRUP IV to upgrade approximately \n100 km of priority national and rural roads, and rehabilitate a similar length of roads on the \nislands  of  Taveuni,  Vanua  Levu,  and  Viti  Levu.8  The  Project  will  be  based  on  the \nrecommendations of the NTSP, and will consolidate the road safety program supported under \nFRUP II and FRUP III. An indicative list of roads is attached as Appendix 2. The TA will help the \nGovernment\u2019s  sector  reform  program  create  institutional  arrangements  for  sustainable \nmanagement of the road subsector by reorganizing and commercializing PWD, out-sourcing to \nthe private sector, and establishing a road fund; and advise the Government on creating the \nappropriate policy environment for public-private partnerships. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n1.  Part  A:  Prepare  the  Investment  Program  and  Provide  Institutional \nDevelopment \n \n14.  Prepare the Investment Program. This activity will build on the subproject feasibility \nstudies and detailed designs for the individual road sections to be undertaken by Government-\nfinanced consultants,9 and prepare a comprehensive feasibility study for FRUP IV for possible \nfinancing by ADB and other cofinanciers. This study, prepared in accordance with appropriate \nADB guidelines, will review the current policies, legislation, role, and performance of key road \ntransport  stakeholders;  and  prepare  a  detailed  feasibility  study  for  the  Project,  addressing \n                                                 \n7  The  Government  will  provide  financing  of  F$1.5  million  (US$1.05  million  equivalent)  in  2005  to  undertake \nsubproject feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs. Of this, approximately F$500,000 will be utilized for \nthe subproject feasibility studies. \n8  The overall length of roads to be included under the loan will be refined during the TA study. \n9 The Government-financed consultants will identify road sections, both sealed and un-sealed, including those \nomitted from FRUP III, for feasibility study for possible implementation under FRUP IV; update traffic forecasts, \ndesign standards, undertake detailed engineering designs and cost estimates; determine the economic internal \nrate of return for each proposed road section; prepare environmental impact assessments in accordance with \nGovernment  and  ADB  requirements;  propose  contract  packages,  prepare  construction  drawings  and  bid \ndocuments, review social and land-acquisition issues and prepare plans for resettlement and compensation, as \nrequired; prepare guidelines for benefit monitoring and evaluation; and prepare an implementation schedule.  \n ", "4  \ntechnical,  financial,  economic,  social,  and  environmental  issues;  determine  appropriate \nprocurement and implementation arrangements; and address the cross-cutting issues of poverty \nreduction, gender, and good governance. \n \n15.  Provide Institutional Development. This activity will (i) assess the current status of the \nDNR  and  help  MWE  describe  the  corporate  identity,  role,  responsibilities,  corporate  plan, \nmanagement  structure,  financial  and  management  reporting  systems,  outsourcing \narrangements and procedures, and staffing requirements of the planned FRA, as well as the \ninterrelationships between the FRA, LTA, and the Transport Planning Unit within the Ministry of \nTransport and Civil Aviation; (ii) recommend a road subsector cost-recovery policy and user \ncharges for road maintenance funding, including the creation of a road fund; and (iii) prepare the \nlegal framework and drafting instructions to establish the FRA. \n \n2.  Part B: Public-Private Partnerships   \n \n16.  This activity will (i) assess the capacity and potential of the private sector to participate in \ninfrastructure financing, operations, maintenance, and service delivery through build-operate-\ntransfer and similar type projects; (ii) analyze the institutional, legal, and regulatory framework; \nand  prepare  legal  drafting  instructions  and  identify  policy  needs;  and  (iii)  prepare  sample \ncontract documents and processes to enable commercial cofinancing, with particular reference \nto ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and international standards for commercial cofinancing. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is US$950,000 equivalent, comprising US$509,000 in foreign \nexchange and US$441,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance US$600,000 to meet the entire foreign exchange cost of US$509,000 and US$91,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the local \ncurrency cost of US$350,000 equivalent. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nshown in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MWE, the Executing Agency for the TA, will coordinate closely with the Ministry of \nFinance,  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation,  and  National  Planning  Office.  MWE  will \nappoint  the  director,  DNR,  as  counterpart  TA  manager,  who  will  also  be  responsible  for \ncoordination between the Government-financed and ADB consultants. A TA steering committee \nwill be chaired by the chief executive officer of MWE, and include senior representatives from \nDNR, Fiji Police, LTA, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public Enterprises, Ministry of Transport \nand Civil Aviation, National Transport Safety Council, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, and other relevant \nagencies.  The  committee  will  meet  monthly  to  provide  technical  oversight  and  review  TA \nprogress, and will circulate minutes to the Ministry of Finance and ADB. \n \n19.  Two teams of consultants will carry out the activities under the TA, as described in the \noutline terms of reference in Appendix 4. A consulting firm (Team A) will be recruited and \nengaged  by  ADB  under  its  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  using  a  biodata \ntechnical proposal to undertake Part A of the TA: (i) prepare the investment program; and (ii) \nprovide institutional development. About 14.5 person-months of international and 6 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting will be required, with experience in transport economics and \n ", "  5\nsector  analysis,  highway  engineering,  road  safety,  environmental  and  social  assessment, \ninstitutional reform, and legislative drafting. A team of individual consultants (Team B) will be \nrecruited and engaged by ADB to undertake Part B of the TA, the study of public-private \npartnerships.  About  5  person-months  of  international  and  3  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  will  be  required  over  3  months,  with  experience  in  public-private  partnerships, \ninfrastructure financing, and legislative drafting.  \n \n20.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Equipment will be procured by \nthe consultants in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB.10 The TA will be carried \nout over 6 months, from March to August 2005. \n \n21.  Consultants to be financed under the TA will prepare (i) a full feasibility study of the \nproposed  FRUP  IV  investment  program,  with  appendixes  covering  the  technical,  financial, \neconomic, poverty, social, and environmental details, in accordance with ADB guidelines (Team \nA); (ii) corporate and business plans and road subsector funding arrangements for the proposed \nFRA, training programs, and drafting instructions for appropriate enabling legislation (Team A); \nand (iii) a description of the financing framework for private-public partnerships, and sample \ndocumentation and drafting instructions for legislation to facilitate such partnerships (Team B). \nEach team will submit a brief inception report, an interim report at the midterm point, a draft final \nreport, and a final report. The Government and ADB will review the draft inception, interim, and \nfinal reports at tripartite meetings to be held in the Fiji Islands with the consultants to review the \nconsultants\u2019 findings and recommendations. The consultants will submit their final reports within \n1 month of receipt of the comments.  \n \nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.
