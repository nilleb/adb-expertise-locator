INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the request of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) during the \nPRC country programming mission in December 2010, a technical assistance (TA) project for \nUrban Stormwater Management and Waterlogging Disaster Prevention was included in the \n2011  nonlending  program  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). 1  ADB  undertook  a \nreconnaissance mission in March 2011. Agreement was reached with the government, including \nthe  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban\u2013Rural  Development  (MOHURD),  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact, \noutcome, outputs, costs and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of \nreference for consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s economic growth since the start of economic reforms in 1978 has been \naccompanied by rapid urbanization. The urban population grew from 160 million in 1975 to \nabout 622 million in 2010.2The urbanization rate increased from 17.0% to 46.6% in the same \n \nperiod and is expected to reach 65.0% (equivalent to an urban population of about 1 billion) by \n2030. This rapid urbanization was fueled largely by the transformation of suburban areas from \nfarming to nonfarming activities and by the massive migration of surplus rural labor to urban \nareas.  The  total  urban  area  in  2010  is  around  85,000  square  kilometers.  Sustainable \nurbanization is a key policy priority in the government\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015). \n \n3.  Alongside rapid urbanization, the PRC faces challenges of insufficient water resources, \nwater  pollution,  and  frequent  flooding  disasters.  Over  100  out  of  656  cities  suffer  from \nwaterlogging in varying degrees, while urban flooding is caused by the uneven distribution of \nprecipitation in time and space and the disappearance of flood plains. At the same time, urban \nstormwater management and waterlogging prevention lag infrastructure building. In many cities \ndrainage pipes are insufficient or poorly maintained, while design standards of the stormwater \nsystem are not up to date. To date, an urban waterlogging emergency response system is yet to \nbe established because related planning policy is lacking. These challenges are exacerbated by \nclimate change and rapid urbanization. \n \n4.  More and more cities incur heavy losses because of urban waterlogging and flooding. In \nJuly 2007, the heaviest rain in the last 115 years brought 266.6 millimeters of rainfall within \n24 hours  in  Chongqing.  This  tremendous  amount  of  rain  caused  heavy  flooding  and \nwaterlogging, which led to a death toll of more than 50 people and an economic loss of more \nthan CNY2.1 billion. In the same month, a historically heavy rain in Shandong Province\u2019s Ji\u2019nan \nCity claimed the lives of 37 people and led to an economic loss of CNY1.2 billion. Waterlogging \nalso  occurs  in  megacities  such  as  Beijing,  Guangzhou,  and  Shanghai,  and  contributes  to \nproperty damage and heavy traffic jams. There is now an urgent need to reform policymaking \nrelated to stormwater management and waterlogging in the PRC\u2019s urban areas. \n \n5.  The urban sector is an ADB investment priority in the PRC. ADB has built a long \nstrategic partnership with MOHURD for over 10 years. The partnership is built on a series of \nhighly  relevant  and  successful  TA  projects,  which  yielded  national  policy  frameworks  and \nguidelines for key urban issues facing large and medium-sized cities in the PRC. Among these \nwere two TA projects that supported water tariff reforms, a TA project aimed at strengthening \nurban solid waste management, and a TA project for the development of urban wastewater \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 6 June 2011. \n2  The urban population mentioned in this report refers to individuals who are officially registered residents of cities, \ncounties, and towns. \n ", "2   \ntariffs.3 Recommendations from these TA projects have been applied in later ADB-financed loan \nprojects  in  the  urban  sector.  Two  TA  projects\u2014the  Urban  Wastewater  and  Solid  Waste \nManagement  for  Small  Cities  and  Towns,  and  the  Urban  Wastewater  Reuse  and  Sludge \nUtilization Policy Study\u2014are providing ongoing support to the government.4 \n \n6.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan  and  is  aimed  at  assisting  the \ngovernment in developing policies, strategies, and action plans to improve urban stormwater \nmanagement and utilization, and waterlogging prevention. It is aligned with ADB\u2019s PRC country \npartnership strategy, which is concerned with managing the environment, catalyzing investment, \nand improving governance, among others.5 It conforms to ADB\u2019s Water Policy, which seeks to \nimprove urban water investments through technical assistance and investments in water supply, \nsanitation and wastewater management, and environmental improvement. The TA will have a \npositive  impact  on  the  living  environment  of  urban  residents  through  water  and  resource \nconservation and disaster prevention. The urban poor, in particular, will benefit from the project \nbecause they are more vulnerable to disasters. The TA also supports ADB\u2019s strategic priorities \nin ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.6 Introducing new approaches of urban stormwater management and \nwaterlogging  prevention  are  positive  steps  toward  resource  efficiency  and  climate  change \nmitigation. Moreover, the TA\u2018s recommendations could lead to the preparation of investment \nprojects where ADB could provide further financing assistance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be a stronger and sustainable system for urban stormwater management \nand waterlogging disaster prevention in the PRC established. The outcome will be a policy \nframework and guidelines on sustainable urban stormwater management and utilization, and \nwaterlogging prevention developed. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA outputs will be (i) a study report that (a) offers recommendations on key policies \nand guidelines for promoting sustainable urban stormwater management and possible utilization, \nand  waterlogging  prevention,  and  recommendations  on  an  institutional  framework  for \nimplementation; and (b) results in widely disseminated publications on key TA findings and \nrecommendations;  (ii)  an  operational  model  plan  for  testing  operations  in  the  pilot  city  to \nimprove  the  urban  stormwater  and  waterlogging  prevention  mechanisms  (the  city  to  be \nnominated during the TA inception stage); and (iii) a best practice policy note on planning, \ndesign standards, regulations, financing approaches, and early flood warning and feedback \nmechanism. The policy note will include a draft set of related national sector guidelines. The TA \nwill  produce  one  main  TA  report,  one  operational  model  plan,  and  three  subreports  on \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 1997.

The TA will hold consultations nationally and in cities to support policy reform on urban \nstormwater management and utilization, and waterlogging prevention. Detailed consultations \nwill  be  carried  out  through  two  workshops  with  stakeholders  such  as  urban  planners, \nconstruction bureaus, municipal financial divisions, municipal operation and management units, \nrepresentative groups, and design institutes.  \n \n10.  The  TA  activities  include  a  desk  study,  surveys,  and  field  trips,  interviews  with \ngovernment officials, workshops, a study tour, and a symposium in Beijing. The desk study will \ncollect the data and do the analysis by reviewing national and international best practice, and \nlessons learned. Field work will include visits to the pilot city, surveys of key organizations, and \ninterviews with officials in relevant government agencies (Urban Planning Bureau, Construction \nBureau,  Municipal  Engineering  Management  Unit,  Water  Conservancy  Bureau,  Flood \nPrevention Office, Finance Bureau, etc.), regarding the status of and problems with urban \nstormwater management and potential utilization, and waterlogging prevention; the possible \nsolutions; and the existing policy framework. A local university or research institute may be \ncontracted to conduct the surveys in cities. Participants in a study tour, who will be officials from \ngovernments that make and implement related policies, will be able to (i) observe good practice \nin a country with rich experience in urban stormwater management and waterlogging prevention; \nand (ii) exchange experiences and lessons learned with officials from other countries. \n \n11.  The  consultants  will  submit  (i)  the  main  TA  report,  (ii)  an  operational  model  plan, \n(iii) three subreports, (iv) a policy note for decision makers, and (v) an executive summary of the \nmain TA report. The consultants will be responsible for organizing consultative workshops, a \nstudy tour, and the symposium to present key TA findings. Policy recommendations and key TA \nfindings will be prepared as an article or knowledge product(s) in a relevant publication and will \nbe disseminated among key stakeholders. The policy note that presents key findings and major \npolicy recommendations of the TA will be shared with national and local decision makers.  \n \n12.  Two workshops and one conference will be held. The workshops will serve as a platform \nfor (i) sharing TA findings at various stages, (ii) building consensus among TA stakeholders, and \n(iii) getting feedback for improving the TA work and findings. The workshops will be issue-\noriented and are tentatively scheduled halfway through the TA, and before the conference. The \nconference will be held toward the end of the TA to (i) disseminate the main findings of the TA, \n(ii) exchange experiences and information, and (iii) provide inputs for improving and finalizing \nthe main report.  \n \n                                                 \n7  Normally in the PRC, the local municipal government manages flood prevention at the urban and city level. The \nMinistry of Water Resources or a river basin management office manages from the river basin level. \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014others). The \ngovernment  will  provide  $100,000  equivalent  to  cover  TA  office  equipment  costs, \ncommunications, and remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff. Cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 14 months, from November 2011 to December 2012. \nMOHURD will be the executing agency for the TA and will coordinate with the relevant central, \nprovincial, and municipal government authorities. It will assign suitable counterpart staff to assist \nthe consultants, and form a project steering committee to guide and support the TA. The \ncommittee will be chaired by the MOHURD vice-minister and will include the directors general of \nUrban Development, Science and Technology, and International Relations of MOHURD, as well \nas  relevant  officers  of  the  ministries  and  agencies  concerned.  MOHURD\u2019s  track  record  in \nimplementing earlier TA projects has strengthened its capacity to implement the TA.  \n \n15.  Consulting services totaling 26.5 person-months (3.5 international and 23 national) will \nbe  required.  The  international  consultant  will  provide  expertise  in  urban  planning  and \nmanagement, and stormwater and waterlogging governance and financial management. The \nnational consultants will have expertise in urban stormwater and waterlogging planning, policy \nand  regulatory  frameworks,  financial  and  economic  analyses,  and  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment. The urban stormwater engineer among the national consultants will be the team \nleader. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be \nhired through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time) based on the quality of the proposal (80%) and the cost (20%) of \nthe  services  to  be  provided  (quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method)  using  the  biodata \ntechnical proposal procedure. All reports by the consultants will be prepared in English and \ntranslated into Chinese. The consultants will maintain close working relations with ADB and with \nMOHURD and will regularly discuss progress and findings. The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Urban Stormwater Management and \nWaterlogging Disaster Prevention, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nA stronger and  By 2017    Government accepts \nsustainable system for  The policy framework and the  Report from MOHURD  the need for urban \nurban stormwater  operational approaches    planning and drainage \nmanagement and  recommended by the TA are    system reform to \nwaterlogging disaster  cleared by the steering committee    improve urban \nprevention in the PRC  for nationwide application.    stormwater design and \nestablished      encourage its utilization. \n         \nThe recommended model has led  Report from the local  The local government in \nto substantive improvement of  government in the pilot  the pilot city remains \nurban stormwater management  city   committed to piloting \nand waterlogging prevention.     and demonstrating the \n    recommended model. \nThe recommended model has  Report from MWR and   \nsignificantly improved urban  municipal management in  Local planning reflects \nstormwater utilization against the  the pilot city  the options for \n2010 baseline.  stormwater utilization.  \nOutcome      Assumption \nA policy framework and  By 2013    Government remains \nguidelines on  Guidelines and technical  Resolution of the steering  committed to investing \nsustainable urban  methodologies are confirmed to  committee  in urban stormwater and \nstormwater  be suitable for adoption by    waterlogging \nmunicipalities in the PRC.   \nmanagement and  prevention. \n   \nutilization, and \nThe operational plan is promoted  TA completion report \nwaterlogging \nby the government as national   \nprevention developed \ngood practice and as basis for    \nnational policy. \nOutputs       \n1.
