INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries1 are in the process of building capacity \nof their national institutions responsible for integrating the environmental issues in the power \nsystem  planning  and  ensuring  sustainable  development  of  power  sectors.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  is  already  supporting  regional  energy  cooperation  in  the  GMS \nthrough the 2007 regional technical assistance (TA) project Facilitating Regional Power Trading \nand  Environmentally  Sustainable  Development  of  Electricity  Infrastructure  in  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion. 2  The  2007  TA,  among  other  outputs,  formulated  the  GMS  Power \nTransmission  Master  Plan  (the  GMS  master  plan),  which  proposes  building  new  power \ngeneration and transmission infrastructure facilities to satisfy the growing demand for energy in \nthe GMS from 2010 to 2025. However, the master plan, which employs a traditional least-cost \napproach, needs to incorporate environmental and social impact assessments of the planned \ninfrastructure facilities. Further there is a pressing need to build the capacity of key GMS \nagencies and utilities to manage and mitigate the social and environmental impacts of these \nfacilities. In this regard, the governments of the GMS countries requested TA from ADB to \nundertake a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of the GMS master plan.3 The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  GMS economies grew at an annual rate of about 7% between 2000 and 2009, and this \ntrend is forecasted to continue in the medium and long term. As a result of this rapid economic \nexpansion, demand for energy in the GMS is projected to increase on average by 7% per year \nduring 2009\u20132025, even taking into consideration energy efficiency improvement and demand \nside management. Electricity generation from natural gas is forecasted to double during 2005\u2013\n2025, while the use of coal will increase fourfold. As the GMS increasingly depends on fossil \nfuels, the amount of greenhouse gas and other pollution entering the atmosphere is rising \nrapidly. It is estimated that the environmental cost of GMS energy consumption will total $320 \nbillion during 2005\u20132025.4 \n \n3.  SEA is a structured process of integrating social and environmental considerations into \nstrategic decision making, such as the formulation of the GMS Power Transmission Master Plan. \nThe GMS has a decade-long history of energy cooperation, but the SEA of energy development \nis relatively new so it was not originally incorporated in the GMS Master Plan. The TA will \nprepare a SEA of the GMS master plan. By recommending incorporation of environmental and \nsocial considerations in the GMS Master Plan before its implementation, the SEA will essentially \nensure its sustainability. \n \n4.  The master plan uses a traditional least-cost approach that takes into account only the \nfinancial costs of electricity generation and transmission. It neglects to fully account for local \nenvironmental and social costs (e.g., local pollution and impacts on public health, and livelihood \ndisruptions),  global  environmental  costs  (greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  global  warming), \n                                                 \n1  Cambodia, Guanxi and Yunan provinces of People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, \nMyanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam \n2  ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nopportunity  costs  of  indigenous  resources,  scarcity  rent 5 of  fossil  fuels,  and  increased \nvulnerability of GMS countries to high and/or volatile energy prices. The TA will formulate \nalternative  scenarios  to  the  master  plan's  current  (\"baseline\")  scenario.  The  alternative \nscenarios  will  incorporate  ambitious  uses  of  renewable  energy,  and  other  environmentally \nprogressive measures. The alternative scenarios will also incorporate more aggressive demand \nside management and mitigate risks associated with fuel price volatility and the depletion of \nindigenous fossil energy resources. \n \n5.  One critical impediment to ensuring sustainable energy is the limited capacity of the \nnational  agencies  responsible  for  integrating  environmental  issues  into  energy  planning. \nAlthough capacity varies from country to country, capacity gaps exist at the national level within \nall  six  GMS  countries.  The  countries  with  the  most  hydropower  potential  (Cambodia,  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Myanmar), which are expected to account for the majority of \npower projects in the GMS through 2025, have the greatest need for improved institutional \ncapacity. The SEA of the GMS Power Transmission Master Plan will provide a comprehensive \ncase for undertaking capacity development in these countries. It will recommend strengthening \nknowledge-sharing  and  experience-exchange  programs,  and  will  encourage  less-developed \ncountries to learn from more-developed ones. \n \n6.  The TA will support the advancement of two strategic thrusts of the GMS regional \ncooperation  strategy: 6 (i)  strengthening  connectivity  and  facilitating  cross-border  trade, \ninvestment, and tourism; and (ii) managing the environment and shared natural resources to \nhelp ensure sustainable development and conservation of natural resources. The TA activities \nwill capitalize upon ADB's cooperation with the Mekong River Commission (MRC), particularly \nMRC's ongoing work on the cumulative impact assessment of eleven proposed hydro-dams on \nthe  Lower  Mekong  under  MRC  Initiative  on  Sustainable  Hydropower. 7  The  TA  also \ncomplements  the  MRC's  Environmental  Program  and  the  MRC's  Climate  Change  and \nAdaptation Initiative. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the proposed TA will be a more environmentally and socially sustainable \nregional electricity supply system in GMS countries. \n \n8.  The  expected  outcome  will  be  enhanced  capacity  of  GMS  country  energy  and \nenvironmental planning agencies and utilities to undertake SEA in energy planning. As a result \nof the TA, these entities will be prepared to manage the energy sector in a more sustainable and \nenvironmentally friendly manner, taking into account environmental and social externalities, fuel \nprice volatility risks, energy security, energy dependency, and opportunity costs.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Scarcity rent is the cost of \"using up\" a finite resource (e.g., fossil fuel), making its benefits unavailable to future \ngenerations. Efficiency is achieved when the resource price of the benefits society is willing to pay for the resource \ntoday equals to the sum of the marginal extraction cost for the fuel and scarcity rent. \n6  ADB 2002.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will employ a  team of consultants to develop an SEA of the GMS Power \nTransmission Master Plan and formulate three alternative scenarios to the master plan baseline \nscenario, involving as much as possible GMS agencies in this work.  \n \n10.  The TA will deliver three main outputs: (i) an SEA of the GMS Power Transmission \nMaster Plan; (ii) two alternative scenarios to the master plan, including detailed assessments of \nthe environmental and social impacts of each scenario; and (iii) strengthened capacity of GMS \ngovernment agencies and utilities to develop SEAs. \n \n11.  The key activity for the first output is to develop a complete SEA of the master plan \nbaseline scenario. The SEA should include a detailed analysis of the master plan's planned \npower generation resources (coal, gas, oil, and hydro), and should also assess its renewable \nenergy  components  (wind,  solar,  and  bio-mass),  energy  efficiency  components,  and  other \nenvironmental elements. The SEA should analyze the social and environmental impacts of each \nproposed investment outlined in the master plan. It should also assess clean-energy measures \ncurrently  being  undertaken  by  national  utilities  and  government  agencies,  and  should  be \nconsistent with national power development plans.8 Based on weighting and trade-off analysis9 \nand sensitivity analysis, the SEA will be used as a basis to formulate policy recommendations \n(including environmental and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures) to make the \nregional master plan more environmentally friendly and socially sustainable.  \n \n12.  The key activities for second output of the TA are: \n(i)  Formulate renewable energy intensive alternative scenario to the GMS Power \nTransmission Master Plan. The renewable energy alternative scenario should \nincorporate  more  ambitious  renewable  energy  targets  (both  hydro  and  non-\nhydro), taking into account the economic potential of renewable energy for each \ncountry.  Estimations  of  economic  potential  should  consider  the  geographic \nlocation of the renewable energy resource, the national grid and its planned \ndevelopment during the planning horizon 2025, and the technical limitations of \ngrid  interconnection  for  highly  intermittent  renewable  energy  resources.  The \nmaster plan and national power development plans will be used as the main data \nsources  for  the  estimation  of  economic  potential  for  each  renewable  energy \nresource.  \n(ii)  Develop an alternative energy security scenario will be elaborated, considering \nmore aggressive demand side management, energy efficiency, and conservation \noptions for the GMS countries. Studies carried out by the World Bank, ADB, and \nother development partners in the GMS (particularly in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Thailand, and Viet Nam) will be considered, as will reports on sectoral \nsaving potential carried out by government agencies and utilities in each country. \nOngoing projects supported by ADB, including efficient power generation based \non biomass and biowaste, will be considered. \n(iii)  Apply SEA to all alternative scenarios to the GMS master plan. The SEAs will \nevaluate the environmental and social externalities of power plants (fossil fuel-\nbased and hydropower projects) proposed in the alternative scenarios, and will \n T  h  e    v i e  w  s    e  x p  r e  s  s e  d    h  e r  e i n    a  r e    those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n8m  Tehmeb eGrMs,S B moaarsdte or fp Dlainre cdteovresl,o pMsa tnhaeg einmteercnotn, noerc stetadf fp, oawnedr  msyasyt ebme  part etlhime inhaigrhy  vino lntaagteu,r e5.0  0 kilovolts and 230 \nkilovolts, and the interconnected power plants planned for utilization up to 2025. \n9  Trade-off analysis is a systemic approach to balancing time, cost, and performance of, e.g., investment projects, \nand showing the optimal outcome of the project based on analyzing the key impacts (weights) from the various \nproject performance indicators. \n ", "4 \nanalyze the climate change externality costs for proposed power generation and \ntransmission  projects.  In  assessing  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  of \nhydropower projects, the following studies will be considered: (a) cumulative \nenvironmental impact assessment conducted by the MRC for 11 hydropower \nprojects  in  the  GMS;  (b)  the  Core  Environment  Program  and  Biodiversity \nConservation Corridors Initiative in the GMS regional TA project,10 which focuses \non  environmental  externalities  in  the  energy  sector  in  the  GMS;  and  (c)  an \nongoing SEA of Viet Nam's National Power Development Plan VII, including \nalternatives to least-cost planning. In analyzing social impacts, the SEAs will \nhighlight gender issues and their integration into energy planning. \n \n13.  The key activities for the third output are as follows: \n(i)  Prepare guidelines for undertaking SEA, with a case study being output 1. The \nguidelines  will  clearly  outline  the  steps,  milestones,  and  corresponding \nintermediate outputs of each step in the SEA process. \n(ii)  Assess the existing capacities of GMS member countries, e.g., environmental \nand  energy  ministries  and  utilities,  in  applying  SEAs  into  national  power \ndevelopment plans. Identify knowledge gaps for each country, and propose a \nmatrix of actions for further capacity building TA. \n(iii)  Develop a training program, which includes workshops covering key steps and \nmilestones of the SEA, analysis of key results from SEAs, and formulating policy \nrecommendations based on SEAs.   \n \n14.  On the basis of the capacity building for SEA on regional level as outlined above, an in-\ndepth capacity building program will be undertaken to address specific gaps and needs at \nnational level in GMS countries. The capacity building needs identified under this TA will be \naddressed, and capacity building will be undertaken in a follow-up TA to be developed in \nconsultation with GMS countries and potential development partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1.35 million equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of France through Agence Francaise de Developpement and \nadministered by ADB.11 The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA and will provide administration and support \nservices. The Southeast Asia Department will oversee the TA. The focal point for participating \ncountries will be the ministry or agency responsible for preparing the power sector development \nplan. Each country will nominate its focal point prior to the commencement of the TA. Focal \npoints will participate in the meetings of the Regional Power Trade Coordination Committee in \nGMS.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented by an international consulting firm, which will provide 55 \nperson\u2013months (27 months international and 28 months national consultants). The TA will \ncommence in March 2011 and will be completed in September 2012. The terms of reference for \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005.
