I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) a proposed grant, and (iii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nGovernment  of  Norway  to  Nepal  for  the  Electricity  Transmission  Expansion  and  Supply \nImprovement Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Gender-\nFocused Capacity Building in Clean Energy, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and \ngrant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve the reliability of energy supply in Nepal and strengthen the \ntransmission infrastructure needed to promote Nepal\u2019s capacity for cross-border energy trade. It \nwill  provide  support  in  three  critical  areas  in  the  electricity  supply  industry,  which  has \nexperienced  severe  underinvestment:  (i)  electricity  transmission  capacity  expansion, \n(ii) strengthening  of  distribution  systems  including  those  along  the  Tamakoshi  (Khimti)\u2013\nKathmandu transmission line, and (iii) rehabilitation of selected small hydropower plants.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The current available generating capacity of  705 megawatts (MW) in Nepal comes \npredominantly  from  hydropower.  At  system  peak  time,  up  to  400  MW  of  load  is  shed3 \ncountrywide, depending on variations in available water resources and transmission limitations. \nSix hydropower projects totaling 592 MW are presently under construction.  Another six projects \nwith a total capacity of 1,335 MW are planned or proposed in the near to medium term. Limited \ntransmission capacity in western region of Nepal has restricted additional electricity imports \nthrough the western border with India. The first large-scale cross-border transmission line with \nIndia between Dhalkebar (Nepal) and Muzarffarpur (India), with a capacity of 1,000 MW, is at an \nadvanced stage of preparation. This will enable Nepal to import electricity from India initially and \nlater facilitate hydropower export. However, the full benefits of this critical regional connection \ncan be harnessed only when adequate strengthening of the related transmission infrastructure \nwithin Nepal is undertaken. \n  \n4.  A total of 16 Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)-owned small hydropower stations with an \noverall capacity of 13.84 MW are connected to the national grid. Another 23 isolated power \nplants with a total capacity of 4.54 MW are owned by the NEA; some of them are operated by \nthe communities. In addition, 21 small hydropower plants established by the private sector \nunder the small power purchase agreements provide 78.5 MW of electricity to the national grid. \nThe  NEA  has  been  implementing  a  plan  to  rehabilitate  aging  small  hydropower  plants  to \nenhance their output. Under the Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement project4, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is assisting the rehabilitation of two such plants. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA. ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Nepal \nfor Preparing the Second Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project. Manila. \n3  Load shedding (also called rolling blackouts) is the practice of using intentionally engineered electrical power \noutages where electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods over geographical regions. Typically, this \npractice arises where demand for electricity exceeds the power supply capability of the network as a result of \ninsufficient generation capacity or inadequate transmission infrastructure to deliver sufficient power to the area \nwhere it is needed. \n4 ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Nepal for the \nEnergy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project. Manila. \n ", "2 \n5.  The interim plan of Nepal5 sets out the Government of Nepal\u2019s long-term vision (up to \n2027) for the energy sector. The related targets include (i) developing 4,000 MW of generation \nfor domestic use, (ii) providing electricity to 70% of the population through the national grid and \n25% through other sources, (iii) increasing per capita consumption to 400 kilowatt-hours, and \n(iv) exporting electricity. Achieving these targets requires rapid expansion of the electricity \nsupply  industry.  To  help  attain  the  government\u2019s  objectives  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Nepal,6 ADB continues to focus on (i) improving access to electricity in \nrural  areas,  (ii)  increasing  energy  efficiency,  (iii)  clean  energy  development,  (iv) regional \ncooperation,  (v)  strengthening  sector  governance,  and  (vi)  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation. \n \n6.  In  2009,  ADB  approved  the  Energy  Access  and  Efficiency  Improvement  Project  to \naddress immediate needs for improvement of electricity supply capacity. Implementation is \nprogressing as scheduled. The project emphasized a financial restructuring plan for the NEA, its \ninternal restructuring, improved revenue collection, effective tariff regulation, and loss reduction. \nThe NEA has prepared and approved a financial restructuring plan (FRP) which is awaiting \ngovernmental adoption. During its policy dialogue with the government, ADB underscored the \nneed to implement the FRP, including average upward tariff revisions, to ensure the long-term \nfinancial sustainability of the sector. In line with the release of project funds is conditioned on the \nadoption  of  the  FRP  and  the  announcement  of  a  tariff  rise.  Further,  the  government \nreconstituted  the  Electricity  Tariff  Fixation  Commission7 as  an  essential  step  toward  the \nproposed tariff increases.  Over the medium term, the project design aims at NEA operational \nsolvency by mid-2015 through multiple measures in the FRP such as reduction of indebtedness, \ntariff revisions, and curtailment of interest on government financing to NEA.  ADB will reserve \nthe right to suspend further disbursements if substantial progress toward this target is not being \nmade.  Under new management, the NEA has instituted substantial reform efforts, including \ninternal restructuring, demonstrably improved revenue collection, and the development of a loss \nreduction plan, including short-term year-end reduction targets. \n \n7.  Large-scale hydropower development is under way in the Tamakoshi Valley, targeting \nboth domestic consumption and export to India. The Tamakoshi\u2013Kathmandu 400-kilovolt (kV) \nline  under  the  project  will  give  increased  evacuation  capacity  from  the  Tamakoshi  Valley \nthrough an alternative route to the Dhalkebar\u2013Muzaffarpur cross-border line via Kathmandu. \nThis  transmission  system  configuration  will  accommodate  and  improve  the  reliability  of \nexporting  the  planned generation. The government  is  promoting  the development  of  small \nhydropower for domestic use, with a standard power purchase tariff provided to the developers. \nThe  government  is  also  encouraging  such  small  hydropower  development  with  people\u2019s \nparticipation through village development and district development committees. The NEA has \nstarted  a  program  to  provide  electricity  access  to  the  communities  affected  by  greenfield \ntransmission line projects.  \n \n8.  The project targets the strengthening and expansion of transmission and distribution \nsystems,  and  enables  Nepal  to  make  further  use  of  its  abundant  hydropower  resources. \nTransmission network strengthening, in conjunction with current hydropower development, is a \nprecondition  to  reducing  load  shedding  and  technical  losses  and  increased  cross-border \nelectricity trade. The project is designed to address these needs of Nepal\u2019s power system. The \nNEA and ADB have agreed to a short list of priority subprojects for inclusion in the project. \n                                                \n5  Government of Nepal. 2008.

In addition, the project supports improved project \nmanagement through the training of NEA staff and provision of implementation consultants. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project will be increased access to reliable supply of electricity through \nimproved electricity supplies and transmission and distribution systems. The outcome of the \nproject will be improved electricity supply through improved connectivity between generation \nand load centers, distribution strengthening, and enhanced small hydropower capacity. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  Output  A: Increased electricity transmission. Output A will include (i) stringing a \nsecond  circuit  on  the  132  kV  transmission  line  between  Kohalpur  and  Mahendranagar, \n(ii) construction of the 220 kV or 400 kV Tamakoshi (Khimti)\u2013Kathmandu transmission line and \nrelated facilities, and (iii) expansion of the Chapali grid substation. \n \n11.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n21.  A Capacity development TA is proposed to be provided for Gender-Focused Capacity \nDevelopment in Clean Energy to enhance livelihood opportunities and increase awareness of \nefficient use of energy in the communities surrounding the project locations. ADB will provide TA \nnot exceeding $250,000 equivalent.  The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform of counterpart staff and office supplies. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). A national nongovernment organization \n(NGO) will be recruited by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). It is anticipated that 84 person-months of national \nconsultant inputs will be provided by the NGO to implement the TA. The NGO will be selected in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method using a quality\u2013cost ratio of \n80:20 and a simplified technical proposal.12 \n \n                                                \n12  The terms of reference for consultants are in Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  Preliminary  technical  due  diligence  has  been  undertaken  on  the  subprojects  and \ndemonstrates that the cost estimates are reasonable and unit cost rates compare favorably with \nsimilar recent projects in India and Nepal. The NEA has undertaken preparatory work to develop \nthe subprojects under output A to the stage of readiness for tendering. \n \n23.  The NEA\u2019s O&M staff is familiar with the technologies and concepts involving all the \nsubprojects except in 400 kV transmission systems. Consequently, the project design envisages \nproviding this required experience through the engagement of an international consulting firm to \nact as the owner\u2019s engineer for output A. Additional demands on the NEA will be due to the \nincreases in line lengths, additional hardware, and resources to maintain transmission lines \nrated for 400 kV. Where any specific training on hardware items is required, the NEA has the \ncapacity to facilitate this, either through in-house training or through manufacturer\u2019s training \ncommitments, which will be incorporated into hardware supply contracts where necessary. The \nsupply contracts will include sufficient spare parts plus quality and performance guarantees.  \nBest practice design standards and construction techniques\u2014including adaptations to counter \nclimate change incidents, e.g., flood and extreme weather\u2014will be applied to all investments \n \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects.13 All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in \nconstant 2011 prices. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the NEA was evaluated \nto  be  0.75%  per  year.  Project financial  viability  was  examined  by  comparing the  financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) with the WACC. The costs of the project were evaluated on the \nbasis of NEA initial assessments, and were verified and compared with industry norms. The \ncapital investments, O&M costs, and taxes incurred to install and operate the project were used \nas  costs.  The  benefits  were  evaluated  in  the  following  manner.  For  output  A:  increased \nelectricity  transmission,  the  benefits  are  through  serving  additional  customer  demand,  and \nevacuation  of  hydropower  from  existing  and  new  power  plants.  For  output  B:  expanded \nelectricity distribution, the benefits arise through the increased electricity sales, which have \nlargely  reached  the  limits  of  the  existing  distribution  substations  and  lines.  For  output  C: \nenhanced electricity generation, the benefits arise from additional generation from rehabilitation \nof two aging small hydropower plants, which are presently providing only a small portion of their \npotential electricity generation. The FIRR of output A is 7.0% while that of output B is 25.0%. \nThe FIRR for part C is 6.4%. These values compare well with the WACC. The FIRR for the \nentire project is 11%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR drops only to 6.8% when \nadverse changes are introduced to all the critical variables. \n \n25.  Each project component has been analyzed for economic viability using a with- and \nwithout-project approach. Without the project, it is assumed that bottlenecks will continue to \ncause disruption, and that newly available generation will not be delivered to final consumers. \nWith the project, it is assumed that there will be increased capacity to evacuate newly available \ngeneration and to reduce system losses, resulting in increases in both non-incremental and \nincremental electricity consumption. Economic evaluation indicates that the project will deliver \nan attractive economic return. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the overall project \nis 25.7%. The EIRR is 23.2% for output A while the EIRR is 40.2% for output B and 18.8% for \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \noutput C. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project returns are robust against changes to \ncritical variables and the project will have a minimum EIRR of 18%. \n \nC.  Governance  \n26.  The  government  will  ensure  that  the  NEA  has  operational  autonomy  and  that  no \norganizational changes will affect its ability to perform its obligations under the project.14 A \nfinancial management assessment and a procurement capacity assessment of the NEA were \nalso conducted during due diligence. The NEA has defined policies and procedures in place for \naccounting, budgeting, and auditing activities. The NEA is required to prepare annual audited \nfinancial reports under the NEA Act and in compliance with accounting requirements of the \nCompanies Act 2007. The NEA has sufficient experience in local and foreign procurement, \nincluding ADB standard bidding procedures,under domestic projects and external assistance \nfrom international development partners. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and the NEA. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Nepal has made considerable progress in reducing poverty. Poverty rates declined in all \nof Nepal\u2019s development regions and ecological belts. More than 80% of the country\u2019s population \nlives in rural areas where poverty is more prevalent. People who tend to remain poor are \nhouseholds of agricultural wage earners, those who are landless or have small land holdings, \nthose of lower castes, those with illiterate household heads, and those living in large households \nwith more than seven members. The poverty classification of the project is general intervention, \nwith  rural  economic  growth  as  a  theme.  The  project  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs  are \nconsistent with Nepal\u2019s tenth plan for poverty reduction. Project interventions are designed to \nbenefit the poor through increased economic opportunity, knowledge, and rights. The project \nhas been designed to be classified as effective gender mainstreaming. It includes a gender and \nsocial inclusion action plan with integrated indicators and targets in the project design and \nmonitoring framework. The gender and social inclusion action plan ensures that women are \nempowered through their participation and representation in a range of project- and nonproject-\nspecific activities. Activities include partnering with local electricity user cooperatives in project \norientation and education awareness, enhancement of livelihoods through skills training, small-\nscale  enterprise  development,  NEA  capacity  building  on  gender  equity,  and  gender-based \ndevelopment  activities  in  the  project  areas.  A monitoring  and  evaluation  system  with  data \ndisaggregated  by  sex, caste,  and ethnicity  will  be  developed  by  the NEA  and  the  project \nmanagement  unit  to  track  social  inclusive  and  gender-based  achievements  of  the  project. \nFinancing of effective gender mainstreaming activities will be from a combination of Government \nof Nepal counterpart funds and ADB\u2019s TASF-IV, complemented by previously approved Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction grant assistance funds.15  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  environment  category  B  and  the  initial \nenvironment examinations were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \n                                                \n14 As part of the NEA financial restructuring plan, the NEA has proposed for government approval the establishment \nof a rural electrification entity, and will undertake to keep ADB informed of any effect this could have on (i) the \nownership and management of assets of the NEA, which are involved in the project; and (ii) the implementation of \nthe project and obligations of the NEA as executing agency. \n15  ADB. 2010.

Public consultation and information disclosure requirements have been met. \nAlignment of transmission lines has avoided any environmentally and ecologically sensitive \nareas. Out of the total length of the Tamakoshi (Khimti)\u2013Kathmandu line, 16 kilometers will pass \nthrough some forest areas in Chanrawati Watershed16, which is host to ecosystem services \ntransaction17 but is not a legally protected area. Any loss of vegetation within the right-of-way \nwill  be  directly  offset  by  reforestation  activities  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the \ngovernment. The NEA and ADB will provide oversight to ensure that ongoing reforestation \ninitiatives within the Chanrawati Watershed will not be affected. Installation of the second circuit \nfor  the Kohalpur\u2013Mahendranagar  line  will  not  have  any  significant  impacts  as  no  new \ntransmission  towers  will  be  required  and  the  existing  right-of-way  will  be  maintained. \nDecommissioned equipment and materials from the rehabilitation of distribution substations and \nthe small hydropower plants are not expected to cause any risk to community health and safety \nas these will be stored on site until they can be safely reused and redistributed to other \nsubstations.  Disposal  of  unusable  equipment  will  comply  with  national  and  international \nrequirements such as the Stockholm Convention.18 \n \n29.  The environmental management plan (EMP) includes mitigation measures, monitoring, \nand adequate budgetary provisions for its implementation. The EMP will be part of the bidding \ndocuments and the NEA will supervise the construction contracts and EMP implementation. \nMonitoring reports will be submitted semiannually by the NEA to ADB. EMPs will be updated if \nunanticipated impacts are identified during implementation. The NEA has sufficient capacity in \nits Environmental and Social Studies Department to implement the EMP. Third-party services \nwill be utilized for monitoring and mitigation activities as necessary. \n \n30.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. The project will \nhave  limited  resettlement  impacts  and  no  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous  groups.19 An \nestimated 39 households, with about 195 people, will lose an estimated 15 hectares of land as a \nresult of the construction of three new substations (Laipur, Kohalpur, and Moolpani) and the \nupgrading of one existing substation (Barhabise). No landowner or household will lose 10% or \nmore of their productive assets. People using or living along the transmission line will be \ntemporarily impacted and restricted to using affected land for agricultural purposes. Affected \npersons  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements. No further clearance or acquisition of land will be required for the project. \n \n31.  The NEA is considered to have adequate institutional capacity to implement, manage, \nand monitor all activities. In contributing to poverty reduction and alleviation, the  NEA and \ncontractors will ensure that 30% of the workforce originates from the local area and that priority \nand preference is given to women, the poor, and marginalized ethnic groups. The project will \npromote and advocate for a socially inclusive, gender equitable, and nondiscriminatory work \n                                                \n16 The watershed area was declared in 2010 after the licensing in 2007 of the Tamakoshi hydropower facilities within \nits boundaries; it was acknowledged that hydropower development would occur in this area which does not \nconstitute a critical habitat.  \n17 Payments to land managers and others to undertake actions that increase the quantity and quality of benefits \npeople gain from ecosystems such as food and water and regulation of floods, drought and land degradation. \n18 United Nations Environment Programme.. 2004.

If impacts are identified, the NEA will be required to \nprepare an indigenous peoples plan identifying fair and inclusive compensation and rehabilitation measures, in line \nwith host country laws, regulations, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements. \n ", "9 \nenvironment and practices. Practices will be consistent with core labor standards, which among \nother things, prohibit the use of child laborers, forced, bonded, or compulsory labor practices; \nand seek to ensure fair treatment, good working conditions, and safe working practices for all \nworkers. Where worker migration is required, the project will minimize the risk of HIV/AIDS \nthrough information dissemination at project areas. Social safeguards shall be achieved in line \nwith the provisions stated in the PAM.20 \n \n32.  A detailed resettlement plan will guide the resettlement process and describe the nature \nof  impacts,  range  of  and  eligibility  for  entitlements,  income  and  livelihood  restoration, \nrehabilitation assistance, and compensation for losses incurred. The resettlement plan details \nthe institutional arrangements for implementation, a procedure for grievance redress, a structure \nfor periodic and regular monitoring and reporting of project activities, detailed cost and budget \nestimates, and a time-bound implementation schedule. The resettlement plan will be updated as \nneeded  and  publicly  disclosed  to  interested  stakeholders  on  the  ADB  and  NEA  websites. \nProject-affected peoples will be consulted on a regular basis as needed, in a timely, open, \ntransparent, and culturally sensitive manner and in the local language. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The project does not have unusual technical risks. Each subproject will use standard \ntechnologies  used  in  Nepal  and  will  be  designed  and  selected  according  to  international \nstandards. The risk of weak technical supervision capacity of the NEA will be addressed by the \nuse of a specialist firm to perform the role of owner\u2019s engineer for the 400 kV rated Tamakoshi \n(Khimti)\u2013Kathmandu line and related transmission substations, which will be at a higher voltage \nthan other existing lines in Nepal. The major risks and mitigation measures are summarized in \nTable 4. The project benefits are expected to outweigh the associated risks. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak governance within the  The Government of Nepal undertakes to maintain the functions of the \nelectricity sector  Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission throughout the project, and NEA to \nmaintain the new NEA corporate governance reform measures.  \nFinancial sustainability of the NEA  Adoption of the FRP and announcement of an initial tariff increase are \nconditions to disbursement of proceeds.  \nWeak implementation capacity in  Implementation consultants will be provided for major components.  \nlarge-scale projects  Subprojects are implemented through EPC contracts. \nTransition to federal structure,  Taking into account the complex political situation, fixed increments of tariff \npolitical uncertainty may lead to  increases are not mandated, but ADB will reserve the right to suspend \nlack of political will to increase  disbursements if it deems that substantial progress toward operational \ntariffs sufficiently to place the NEA  solvency by mid 2015 is not being made. \non a solid financial footing \nNEA loses government support due  NEA will implement system loss reduction plans and arrears collection \nto weak internal governance  programs as ongoing covenants. \nRisk of corruption as general  NEA will disclose on project website the audited project financial accounts; \nfeature of landscape  project progress; and procurement short lists, invitations for bid, and contract \nawards.
