THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Hydro Developments Pty Ltd (Hydro Developments), via its 100% subsidiary, Hydro \nTaveuni Pte Ltd, has been shortlisted in a tender by Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) for an independent \npower producer (IPP) to provide up to 45 gigawatt-hours per annum of renewable energy to Vanua \nLevu, Fiji\u2019s second largest island, and neighboring island Taveuni. The Project will consist of two \nrun-of-river hydropower units to be built on Taveuni, Lavena (up to 4 megawatts [MW]) and \nSalialevu (2MW), serving a population approaching 36,000 people who currently rely on diesel \npower generation.1 The project also includes 75km of 33 kilovolt (kV) transmission connecting \npower generation on Taveuni, 9km of subsea cable to connect Taveuni transmission to the \nadjacent island of Vanua Levu, and 115km of 66kV transmission on Vanua Levu to connect to \nEFL\u2019s existing grid. ADB may participate in the expected subsequent financing of the approximate \n$40 million capital cost (including transmission) required to build the project. \n \n2.  The Fiji Government, under the 2017 National Development Plan,2 has a goal for 100% of \nFijians to have access to electricity before December 2022 (currently 96%),3 with 81% of this \nelectricity to be supplied from renewable sources, increasing to 100% by 2030.4 The Government \nalso has a goal of 30 percent reduction of carbon emissions from the energy sector by 2030.5 \nCurrently, approximately 45% of Fiji\u2019s power needs are supplied through fossil fuels, 50% through \nhydropower,  and  the  remaining  5%  from  biomass  and  wind  power.6 The  project  is  being \ndeveloped with the strong support and involvement of the local \u201cMataqali\u201d or indigenous clan, and \nthere will be no displacement of communities. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The technical assistance (TA) transaction of $500,000, to be implemented over a 15-\nmonth period (October 2021\u2013December 2022), will be provided to Hydro Developments to assist \nHydro Developments and EFL to complete the project feasibility study. Hydro Developments \nconducted extensive project survey and pre-feasibility work over 2019-21, followed in Q3 2021 \nby engineering feasibility study work by Australian consultancy AEP Elical funded by $500,000 \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED].7 Preliminary feasibility study conclusions including \nestimated power tariff costs will be submitted to EFL for its Board consideration of the proposed \nindependent power producer (IPP). \n \n4.  Should EFL request Hydro Developments to proceed with its IPP proposal, further TA \nsupport is needed due to relatively large areas of land, including sub-sea terrain, that need to be \nexamined for environmental feasibility, and expert environmental and legal opinions are essential \nto complete the project feasibility study exercise. The TA will also build the capacity of Hydro \nDevelopments to administer the ensuing Project and ensure Project readiness for implementation \nonce a commercial IPP power purchase agreement is negotiated with EFL.  \n \n \n \n1  As estimated by Hydro Developments. \n2  Government of Fiji, Ministry of Economy. 2017.  5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan: Transforming Fiji \n3  ADB.

Cost and Financing \n \n6.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF)-Income Transfer.8  The TA will fund two consulting \ncontracts,  the  project  environmental  impact  study  and  project  legal  services,  with  the  key \nexpenditure items listed in Appendix 1. \n \n7.  The TA will include full recovery of the amount financed under the TA if the project \nsponsors are subsequently able to raise the necessary capital to build the project. \n \n8.  Hydro Developments will fund in parallel additional project development costs (estimated \nat  $315,000,  including  in-kind  contribution)  including  staff  costs.  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED]. Hydro Developments has been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  Hydro Developments will sign a TA agreement generally in accordance with the document \nin Appendix 2, which incorporates ADB\u2019s standard terms and conditions for such TA. PSOD will \nadminister the TA and may delegate certain activities to PARD\u2019s Pacific Subregional Office \n(SPSO) in Suva, Fiji, including disbursement of the TA resources in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). PSOD will \ncoordinate with SPSO for recruitment of consultants, as well as monitoring and evaluation of the \nTA.  \n \n10.  ADB will engage the two consulting firms to be funded by the TA following the ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  project \n \n8  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n ", "3 \nadministration instructions and/or staff instructions.9 The recruitment of the consultants by ADB \nwill be undertaken via Limited Competitive Bidding, due to the limited number of qualified \nenvironmental and legal firms with relevant experience and staff in Fiji, restrictions on travel due \nto the ongoing effects of COVID-19, the confidential nature of Hydro Development\u2019s EFL tender \nshortlisting, and the short time period in which Hydro Developments must respond to EFL with \nthe  completed  studies.  Output-based,  lump-sum  contracts  will  be  required  in  each  case. \nDisbursement and payment of services will be conditional on the quality of the output as reported \nby Hydro Developments, and ADB\u2019s endorsement of the same (see Appendix 1). \n \n11.

PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES \nHydro Developments Pty Ltd (Hydro Developments) is participating in a tender with Energy Fiji \nLimited (EFL) to provide up to 55 GigaWatt hours per annum of renewable energy from Taveuni \nIsland via two to-be-built hydropower units called Lavena and Salialevu (the Project), serving a \npopulation  approaching  36,000  people  currently  relying  predominantly  on  diesel  power \ngeneration. \n \nThe Lavena subproject involves diversion of water from Wainisairi Creek at an elevation of \napproximately 285m above sea level, The creek, impoundment and weir, pipeline, penstock, and \npowerhouse areas are all reportedly located within land owned by the Mataqali Matakuro, with \nwhom a land lease has been signed.  \n \nThe Salialevu subproject involves diversion of water from Drekeniwailevu Creek near the eastern \nboundary of the Salialevu Estate and running this water through a pipeline with a length of \napproximately 1,600m to a power plant located close to sea level, about 2,000m northeast of \nSalialevu village. A subsidiary intake located on adjacent crown land will increase the output from \nthe Project.   \n \nThe outputs from the two plants will be delivered to a substation near Waiyevo Village by means \nof 33kV transmission lines with total length 75km. A 9km submarine cable would be built from a \nproposed 11/33kV sub-station at Waiyevo across the Somosomo Strait to Vatudamu Point in the \nsoutheast of Vanua Levu. A new 66kV overhead transmission line of 115km is proposed for \nVanua Levu. \n \n \n ", "7 \nThe Project is being considered for financing by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and as such \nthe Company requires the services of an independent environmental and social consultant (\u201cthe \nConsultant\u201d)  to  develop  a  Project  ESIA  and  ESMP  including  associated  facilities  such  as \naccesses, rainfall and flow measurement installations, bathymetyric and other surveys and, if \ndetermined to be required, additional assessments and plans to ensure the Project is compliant \nagainst the Assessment Framework. \n2.  ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK \nThe following standards are the Assessment Framework against which this scope of work is to \nbe undertaken: \n\uf0b7  Applicable local, and national environmental and social laws and regulations of Fiji relating \nto concessions, land acquisition and resettlement, labor and working conditions, public \nand occupational health and safety, ethnic groups/indigenous peoples and environmental \nprotection, to obtain and update Government approval for the Project; \n\uf0b7  ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) (2009); \n\uf0b7  ADB Social Protection Strategy (2001); \n\uf0b7  ADB Gender and Development Policy (1998); \n\uf0b7  ADB Access to Information Policy (2019); \n\uf0b7  World  Bank  Group/IFC  (2018)  Good  Practice  Handbook  Environmental  Flows  for \nHydropower Projects.

SCOPE OF WORK  \nADB requires an environmental and social impact assessment in accordance with Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) requirements for the Project and all Associated Facilities.  The scope is \nprovided below in 2 phases, detailed by task. The Consultant should respond to the scope in their \nproposal, highlighting any additional tasks that may be required.  \n \n ", "8 \nPhase 1:  Desk Review and Scoping Study \n \nAn Initial Environmental Evaluation is currently being undertaken as part of the Phase A feasibility \nstudy being prepared by Hydro Developments for submission to EFL. A Screening Application is \nalso being prepared for submission to the Fiji Department of Environment. This work will form part \nof a scoping report to be submitted to ADB including methodology development, following a \ndesktop review and gap assessment. The scoping report will need to be reviewed by ADB and \nshould include a review of all existing documentation, detailed Project reports, concession \nagreements, government order/awards relating to land/RoW acquisition available for the Project \nand other relevant documentation. The purpose of the review is to get an understanding of the \nProject and associated impacts and identify gaps with respect to the Project\u2019s Assessment \nFramework. This review will include areas such as social, poverty and gender assessments, land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  biodiversity  assessments,  environmental  flows  assessments, \nstakeholder engagement, labor and working conditions, cumulative impact assessments, noise \nand vibration assessments, safety risk assessment, natural hazards, climate risk assessment, \nwater resources and spring hazards assessment, and contractor management, among others. It \nis expected that the desk review will help in identifying data/information needs and streamline the \napproach and methodology for the ESIA consistent with Project requirements. \n  \nSpecifically, this phase of the work will entail the following:   \n\uf0b7  Review of the Project\u2019s (including any Associated Facilities) existing environmental, social and \ngender  documentation  (including  environmental  and  social  management  plans),  if  any, \nagainst the Assessment Framework. This assessment will be based on the review of available \ndocuments, and discussion with relevant individuals, and may result in recommendations for \nimprovement to existing documents, baseline surveys, or supporting studies. This review \nshould include (but not be limited to) the review of the following: \no  Potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and induced impacts and risks to physical, biological, \nand physical cultural resources in the context of the Project\u2019s area of influence. \no  The analysis of alternatives and complement as necessary including non-hydropower \nenergy  generation  options,  and  technology  and  operation  alternatives  and  their \ncorresponding environmental and social impacts.  \no  The environmental and social baseline data and identify research or supplemental studies \nrequired to address data gaps or ensure its validity.  \no  The coverage, methods, and results of geological, bathymetric, hydrogeological and \ngeohazards and landslide risks investigations performed to date and determine and justify \nthe need for additional field surveys to enable the assessment of impacts associated with \nProject activities (in particular tunneling and blasting) on households, springs and other \nrelevant infrastructure.  \no  Biodiversity baseline information available from primary and secondary sources that \nclarifies whether any of the following species may occur in the Project area and, if so, \nwhether it is likely that the area meets Critical Habitat thresholds for each species in \nreference to IFC Performance Standard 6 Guidance Notes (2019) \u2013 in particular: (i) \nglobally or nationally critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable species; and (ii) \n ", "9 \nendemic, or restricted-range species.

It is envisaged that this work may entail: \n\uf0b7  Modifications to  the  existing  baseline  surveys and/or the  conduct  of additional  surveys \n(including those related to biodiversity and socioeconomics), other supporting studies or \naccompanying maps and figures; \n\uf0b7  Modifications to the existing studies and management plans and/or the conduct of additional \nassessments  and  plans  regarding  land  acquisition  /  allocation  and  indigenous \npeoples/minority ethnic groups (including a Social Compliance Audit for prior activities and \nimpacts, as applicable, and determined and agreed in Phase 1); \n\uf0b7  Modifications  to  existing  and/or  the  development  of  additional  Environmental,  Social, \nOccupational Health & Safety, Community Health & Safety management plans, and Project \nCompany and EPC labor standards and procedures; and \n\uf0b7  Modifications  to  existing  and/or  the  development  of  additional  gender  assessments  on \nwomen\u2019s economic and social empowerment in the context of the Project and highlight key \nopportunities for the Project to address existing local gender equality gaps. \nThe tasks listed below are indicative of the scope and coverage of the ESIA. They are suggestive \nof the approach and methodology to be undertaken by the Consultant in carrying out these \n ", "12 \nassessments.  The  Consultant  is  expected  to  refine/modify/suggest  alternative  approach  as \nrequired/deemed suitable. The final outcome of the study should include the following: \n\uf0b7  Description of the Project: Provide a comprehensive description of the Project including m\najor components and ancillary / associated facilities required by and for the Project such as a\nccess roads, quarries and borrow pits, proposed transmission lines, etc. If a river diversion pl\nan during construction is foreseen, this should be further elaborated by providing the necess\nary schematic diagrams for reference.  Similarly, the Project\u2019s dewatered segment during op\nerations should be clearly described, as well as the expected operational mode (e.g., true ru\nn-of-river, etc.) minimum flows and drawings and maps showing the Project\u2019s layout and com\nponents, the Project site and area of influence should be provided. \n\uf0b7  Legislative and Regulatory Requirement: The Consultant shall identify and describe the p\nertinent regulations and standards - both local and international, governing the environmenta\nl quality, health and safety, protection of sensitive areas, land use control at the national and \nlocal levels, gender equality, and ecological and socio-economic issues. Thereafter, the Con\nsultant shall identify the Project activities that should comply with the identified regulations. \n\uf0b7  Description of the Baseline Environment:2 The Consultant is required to review, collect, c\nollate, and present baseline information on the environmental characteristics of the Project\u2019s \narea of influence. This description should involve but not be limited to physical, biological, an\nd socio-economic parameters, resource base, and infrastructure. The assessment should de\nlineate and cover the Project impact areas (primary and secondary/induced impacts). The de\nscription of the environmental and social baseline data includes (but is not limited to) the foll\nowing: \no  River Use:  \n\uf0a7  The description of downstream water, river uses (existing and future) and discharge\ns should be included in the ESIA and supported by survey data.  \n\uf0a7  A sample survey of households likely to be affected (directly by loss of land or a res\nult of Project related development including cumulative developments in the river ba\nsin) as a part of the social assessment should be undertaken to confirm existing use\ns (e.g., domestic water supply for part of the year, fishing, irrigation, ceremonial, cult\nural or recreational uses) with the objective of ensuring that these uses will be maint\nained, provided for by another means, or compensated for.  \n\uf0a7  If there is seasonal use of the river, then the surveys conducted should take this into\n account. \n \n2  Please note that it is very important that any additional baseline data to be collected is well conceived and the \nsampling methodology well defined. Before engaging in any extensive geomorphological, physical, hydrological, \nbiological or social surveys the Consultant should clearly define the questions expected to be answered. For \ninstance, any additional social surveys should be guided by the Land Acquisition, Involuntary Resettlement and \nLivelihood Restoration Plan (RAP), or any additional aquatic and riparian or hydro-morphological data should be \nguided by the data needed to define an adequate downstream flow regime. Therefore, we do not expect extensive \nbiological or social surveys without a clear purpose, and any new data should have a clear well stated objective \nand targeted to propose management measure for specific impact/ risks. \n ", "13 \n\uf0a7  River uses should be assessed in four different segments of the river: (a) Upstream \nfrom the expected reservoir, (b) all flooded areas, (c) the de-watered segment, and (\nd) downstream of the powerhouse.   \no  Biophysical Aspects: \n\uf0a7  Regional geology, Project specific geology, and seismic hazards studies. \n\uf0a7  Topography and bathymetry of the Project area of influence. \n\uf0a7  Hydrological and meteorological data. \n\uf0a7  Geo-morphological aspects such as catchment stability, sediment load, sediment tra\nnsport, erosion management / soil permeability. \n\uf0a7  Erosion, landslides historical records and expected risks. \n\uf0a7  Climate change risk assessment. \no  Biological Resources (Terrestrial, Freshwater and Marine Ecology):  \n\uf0a7  Completion of a full marine survey to identify the features on the sea floor for the wh\nole length of the cable. Video surveys used to provide an overview of conditions in t\nhe Project\u2019s impact areas. \n\uf0a7  Assessment of whether the Project impact areas are located near or within environm\nentally sensitive areas.  The location of these sensitive areas should be reflected in \nmaps of the Project context. \n\uf0a7  Methodologies for data gathering, mapping, surveys, sampling and special studies - \nterrestrial (vegetation/flora/fauna and terrestrial wildlife), aquatic (e.g., fish/fishery su\nrvey/benthic organisms/coral) within the primary and secondary impact areas should\n be described.  Seasonal sampling and analysis should be undertaken.   \n\uf0a7  Habitats within the Project area should be characterized and mapped as modified, n\natural or critical based on ADB SPS definitions.  \n\uf0a7  The results of the terrestrial and aquatic survey and studies should note any threate\nned species or habitats, endemic/restricted range species, geographically- restricted\n species assemblages or habitats, migratory and/or congregatory species (including \nfish breeding grounds), and key ecosystem services.  \n\uf0a7  The current status of threats to biodiversity - notably invasive species of flora and \nfauna \u2013 should be identified in the Project impact areas. \n\uf0a7  If preliminary data indicates that the Project may be considered to be within a Critica\nl Habitat, then a Critical Habitat Assessment should be an integral component of the\n ESIA. \n\uf0a7  Appropriate maps, figures, graphs and diagrams should be provided for ease of refe\n ", "14 \nrence, e.g., land use map of the Project area, survey areas, etc.  \no  Surface Water Quality, Air Quality and Noise Levels: \n\uf0a7  The ESIA will delineate all Project impact areas (primary and secondary impact area\ns), and also identify socially sensitive receptors e.g., school, hospitals, residential, te\nmples, or other sites of religious, cultural, heritage or aesthetic value etc. that existin\ng within the Project areas.  Roads, transmission lines, spoil disposal areas, quarries \nand any associated facility should be included in the Project area of influence.  \n\uf0a7  Methodologies for data gathering, sampling, analysis and modeling (if required). In a\nddition to standard water quality methods, BMWP-type biological metrics should be \nconsidered.  \n\uf0a7  Results of laboratory testing and interpretation (e.g., surface water, air quality, and n\noise levels) should be presented and compared against the local and international e\nnvironmental standards and those required under WBG EHS General Guidelines an\nd relevant ADB requirements. \n\uf0a7  Location maps, figures, graphs, and diagrams should be provided for ease of refere\nnce. \no  Groundwater and Springs:  \n\uf0a7  The study will delineate Project impact areas (primary and secondary impacts) likely\n to be affected by the construction and operations such as: (i) ground water, water w\nells, and springs along the tunnel alignment; (ii) springs and wells along access road\ns, quarries and other ancillary facilities; (iii) springs and wells that could be affected \nby flooding; and (iv) springs and wells along the dewatered segment.  Community u\nsage and impacts on these ground water springs and water bodies would also be de\ntermined/baseline assessed and impacts along with mitigation measures delineated. \no  Economic, Social and Cultural Aspects: \n\uf0a7  Baseline sex-disaggregated socio-economic profile of the communities in the Projec\nt area and dependencies on common community property and resources. \n\uf0a7  Land ownership, land use, and any land legacy issues within the area to be affected\n and acquired by the Project. \n\uf0a7  Existing vulnerabilities. \n\uf0a7  Sex-disaggregated socio-economic and cultural information on the potential host co\nmmunities for resettled population (if identified). \n\uf0a7  Data on employment, identifying existing skills of the labor force. \n\uf0a7  Brief description of the potential workforce that will be brought to the site, from const\nruction to operations. \n ", "15 \n\uf0a7  Potential impact/s of the Project on the local labor market and labor-market-related a\nctions that can be taken in the Project to address various labor-related risks, includin\ng lack of adherence to the core labor standards. \n\uf0a7  Dependence (economic, social, cultural) on the marine environment as well as the ri\nver and water bodies linked to the river basin in the area, including \u2013 as much as po\nssible \u2013 quantification of ecosystem services which may be impacted by the Project. \n\uf0a7  Health condition of the Project affected population. \n\uf0a7  Infrastructure and amenities. \n\uf0a7  Any other sensitive social receptors in the area which could have links to the Project\n including local community gender norms and inequality status; local community pre\nvalence of gender-based violence; sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment affect\ning women and children; and risks to child protection. This assessment requires me\netings and interviews with women\u2019s focus groups and other relevant stakeholders.  \no  Gender Analysis: \n\uf0a7  Gender sensitive data collection and baseline information on women\u2019s economic an\nd social empowerment in the context of the Project, including gender differentiations\n in access to education and healthcare, skills levels, roles and responsibilities in the \ncommunities, and economic occupations. \n\uf0a7  Identification of gender dimensions of key social and institutional issues in relation to\n Project objectives and key opportunities for the Project to address existing local gen\nder equality gaps. \n\uf0a7  Gender assessment of the Project Company, with analysis of the organizational prof\nile of the Company and how gender equality is considered by the Company. \n\uf0b7  Analysis of Alternatives: This section should cover the economic, technical, environmental\n, and social issues that were considered for each major design feature where they apply, pro\nviding justification for the selected sites, designs and operating regime, and describe the maj\nor impact mitigation measures. Alternative options, particularly for location and design of Pro\nject infrastructure, should include (as much as possible quantitative) assessment of both fina\nncial costs of such alternatives and costs/benefits from a social and environmental perspecti\nve, to contribute to a comprehensive analysis that demonstrates that the overall benefits fro\nm the Project will substantially outweigh the Project costs (including social and environmenta\nl costs). Project alternatives that need to be discussed to complete this section include:  \n\uf0a7  \u201cno project\u201d alternative; \n\uf0a7  Cable route and landing sites; \n\uf0a7  project operation regime (generation flows); \n\uf0a7  spoil disposal sites; \n ", "16 \n\uf0a7  quarry site; \n\uf0a7  camps; \n\uf0a7  access road alignment/s; and \n\uf0a7  transmission line alignment. \n\uf0b7  Anticipated Impacts and Mitigation Measures: This section predicts and assesses the Pr\noject\u2019s likely positive and negative direct and indirect impacts to physical, biological, socioec\nonomic, and physical cultural resources in the Project\u2019s area of influence. The assessment s\nhould be conducted in quantitative terms to the extent possible; identify mitigation measures \nand any residual negative impacts that cannot be mitigated; explore opportunities for enhanc\nement; identify and estimate the extent and quality of available data, key data gaps, and unc\nertainties associated with predictions and specifies topics that do not require further attention\n; and examine global, transboundary, and cumulative impacts as appropriate.  \nThis section should include a standard format matrix that identifies potential impacts on land \nresources, water resources, water quality, air and noise, flora & fauna (terrestrial, \nfreshwater, and marine), ecosystem services, climate change, soil, cumulative impacts, \nphysical cultural resources, public and community health and safety, and socio-economic \nenvironment and any other relevant parameters, and rank these impacts in terms of their \nseverity and duration.  \nParticular focus should also be allotted to the following:  \no  Cumulative River Basin Impacts: The potential for cumulative effects of multiple hydro\nelectric Projects (existing and foreseen/planned) and other impacts in the same river bas\nin should be addressed in the ESIA. Any significant cumulative basin impact/s that the Pr\noject will make a notable contribution to needs to be identified and predicted. Such impac\nts primarily relate to altered river flows, habitat fragmentation and the related effects on a\nquatic ecology. Impacts affecting erosion control and sediment management, as well as i\nncremental degradation of provisioning, regulating, cultural, and/or regulating ecosystem\n services should also be assessed. The Consultants should refer to IFC\u2019s Good Practice \nHandbook on Cumulative Impact Assessment and Management: Guidance for the Privat\ne Sector in Emerging Markets, and take the opportunity to undertake any additional stak\neholder engagement and consultation efforts needed for the preparation of the ESIA to d\nefine, and reach consensus on, the Valued Environmental and Social Components (VEC\n) on which to focus a Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA), and upon which manageme\nnt strategies shall be developed and implemented. \no  Climate Change Related Impacts and Risk: This section should assess the Project\u2019s c\nontributions to climate change through the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \nand avoidance and quantify greenhouse gas emissions. It should also assess the Project\n\u2019s physical resilience to climate-related adverse weather events (such as sea-level rise, fl\noods, droughts, storms, landslides) and how this may affect Project operations and perfo\nrmance or verify that these have been considered in engineering design.     \n ", "17 \n\uf0b7  Public Consultation and Stakeholder Engagement Process: Consultations and stakehold\ner engagement activities undertaken by the Project both to-date and for the purposes of the \nsupplementary ESIA studies and findings should be documented. In addition, fresh/new con\nsultations will be carried out with local community members and local leaders, knowledgeabl\ne people, CSO/NGOs operating in the area (local and international), political representatives\n, etc. to document their concerns and to outline how these issues/concerns will be addresse\nd within framework of Project.  This should include the development of a stakeholder mappin\ng and engagement plan based on the understanding of stakeholder interests, expectations, c\noncerns and influence will be carried out and documented. The Consultant will ensure that th\ne information is sex-disaggregated and surveys are conducted in a gender-sensitive manner\n. For instance, the surveys will be conducted with both male and female respondents and en\nsure adequate representation of female-headed households. Where possible, women-only fo\ncus groups will be consulted and gender issues raised as part of the consultations. Context-s\npecific, culturally appropriate and inclusive data collection methods will be applied. Please n\note that consultation with stakeholders has to continue during Project implementation as nec\nessary to address issues related to environmental assessment. The consultation process an\nd its results are to be documented and reflected in the ESIA report. \n\uf0b7  Project Environmental and Social Impacts and Risks and Mitigation/Resettlement Acti\non: The Consultant will provide an analysis on the environmental and social impacts and risk\ns of the Project and discuss measures to mitigate adverse impacts and risks and enhance e\nnvironment and social benefits on the Project affected areas. The following potential environ\nmental and social impacts should be considered (but not be limited to) while preparing the E\nSIA: \no  The social impacts linked to communities in the Project area including any/all households\n/individuals/entities that will be physically or economically displaced (e.g. including ecosy\nstem services impacts) by Project infrastructure or associated facilities; \no  Households or individuals utilizing the government land, i.e. (i) those with the agreement \nor authorization from the government; or (ii) those who are informally (unauthorized) usin\ng the land;  \no  Individual or households whose access to natural resources important to their livelihoods\n (i.e. ecosystem services) will be impaired; \no  The ESIA must provide the exact location of labor camps, those communities nearest to \nthe labor camps and the potential impacts of having influx of workers into the community \nand workers-community interactions; \no  Whether the Project\u2019s environmental flows (eFlows) are appropriate to maintain ecosyste\nm services, aquatic biota, fish migration, river connectivity, water quality, and socio-econ\nomic and tourism activities in the dewatered stretches of affected rivers. This should be e\nvaluated through the use of adequate eFlows assessment methodology and scenarios a\nnd consider upstream-downstream migratory connectivity, seasonal flows, fish entrainme\nnt, and review of the design of any physical mitigation measures and assessment of their\n ", "18 \n adequacy for targeted fish; \no  Whether the Project will impact on the local fishing and tourism sector; \no  Impact on aquatic (freshwater and marine) and terrestrial flora and fauna (wildlife) and h\nabitats in the Project area including impact on any threatened, restricted-range or protect\ned species/habitats or any other Critical or Natural habitat values. Quantification of impac\nts should be attempted wherever possible. In particular, for habitats, this should include q\nuantification of Project direct and indirect habitat loss and degradation on modified, natur\nal and critical habitat using an appropriate metric (e.g. Quality Hectares); \no  Impact linked to potential for sedimentation, erosion and land-slides to occur during each\n Project stage including the potential for river or marine scour and bank erosion leading t\no asset loss; \no  Impacts associated with the management and disposal of waste throughout Project impl\nementation due to limitations in local capacities and facilities for appropriate waste dispo\nsal. Also, the extent to which construction and quarrying will generate noise and vibration\n, odor and other nuisance to local communities and sensitive receptors. Impacts and issu\nes linked to rehabilitation of burrow pits, disposal sites, and quarries; \no  Traffic, access and transportation linked impacts; \no  Occupational health and safety impacts; \no  Community health, safety and security issues and impact including those linked to influx \nof migrant workforce; \no  Assessment of gender risks (such as the occurrence of gender-based violence during co\nnstruction), of opportunities (such as employment creation during both construction and \noperation of the Project), and of potential negative impact on gender dynamics that may \naffect men and women in Project- area and Company; \no  Emergency scenarios during construction and operation and potential environmental and\n social impacts; \no  The presentation of emission savings from the generation of renewable energy; and \no  Assessment of climate change related risks.  \n\uf0b7  Development of Impact Mitigation and Management Plans: The Consultant shall develop\n a comprehensive Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). The plan should rec\nommend a set of mitigation, monitoring and institutional measures to eliminate, minimize or r\neduce to acceptable levels of adverse environmental and social impacts and/or maximize so\ncio-economic benefits. The ESMP shall include a gender action plan based on the gender as\nsessment and recommend mitigation measures on gender gaps to be addressed by the Proj\nect. The Consultant should provide cost outlays for the proposed mitigation measures as wel\nl as their institutional and financial support, time frame and responsibility. This shall be provid\ned for all the Project phases.  \n ", "19 \nThe Consultant is required to give specific descriptions, and technical details, of monitoring \nmeasures for the ESMP, including the parameters to be measured, methods to be used, \nsampling locations, and frequency of measurements. The monitoring should be designed to \nassess achievement of specific targets (as appropriate, e.g., No Net Loss of biodiversity), \ndefinition of thresholds of deviation from these targets that will signal the need for corrective \nactions, as well as deliver a monitoring and reporting procedure that will include assessment \nof progress towards these targets. The Consultant should provide a time frame and \nimplementation mechanism, staffing requirements, training and cost outlays. \n\uf0b7  Development of Stakeholder Engagement and Grievance Redress Plan: The Consultant\n should, as a part of the ESIA, undertake stakeholder consultations especially taking into con\nsideration the gender concerns and vulnerable groups. A Stakeholder Engagement and Grie\nvance Redress Plan should be developed for the Project which would be implemented by th\ne Project proponents.  The Stakeholder Engagement plan should: \no  Identify affected people/groups/communities/civil society organizations (stakeholders); \no  Delineated measures to allow meaningful engagement with different stakeholder (in a tra\nnsparent, accessible manner using culturally appropriate communication methods) so as\n to facilitate dissemination of information to stakeholder;  \no  Suggest differentiated measures to allow effective participation of disadvantaged and vul\nnerable groups; \no  Provide systems for prior disclosure/dissemination of information and consultation includi\nng seeking inputs from affected persons, incorporation of inputs, as applicable, providing\n feedback to affected persons/groups on whether and how the input has been incorporat\ned; \no  Include mechanisms for feedback and dispute resolution (grievance management and ha\nndling system for the Project); and \no  Documentation, reporting and monitoring procedures. \nPhase 2b: Social Compliance Audit and/or Resettlement Action Plan Preparation \nDepending upon the status of land availability and arrangement for the Project, the Consultant \nwill undertake (either or both): \n\uf0b7  A Social Compliance Audit (SCA) to identify any past or legacy or current issues associate\nd with land acquisition and measures required (if any) to ensure compliance to SPS requirem\nents. This will include an onsite assessment to identify past and present concerns related to i\nmpacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples to determine the level of complia\nnce with national legislation and SPS SR2 and SR3, and to identify and plan appropriate me\nasures to address outstanding compliance issues. Where a non-compliance is identified a co\nrrective action plan (CAP) will be developed. The SCA will be a discrete document but appen\nded to the Project ESIA. \n\uf0b7  While it is anticipated that land-related impacts with regard to the main Project components l\n ", "20 \nand areas leased by the Municipality to the Company will be minimal, the SCA may, if deem\ned necessary in Phase 1, assess the following areas of enquiry against the requirements of \nADB SR2 and SR3: \no  Undertake a full replacement cost assessment study describing methods, results and the\n expert opinion whether the compensations paid for affected assets for the Projects repre\nsent full replacement costs and thus complying in this respect with ADB SPS SR2 requir\nements; \no  Obtain information from the Project Sponsor such as inventory of losses, census survey, \nGIS and cadastral information; minutes of meetings or any documentation or records of e\nngagement between the government authority, the affected landowners or users (residen\ntial/commercial or any other either directly or indirectly dependent on land or its immovab\nle asset) on land acquisition and resettlement; records of evidence of payment made;  \no  Prepare a worksheet presenting the list of affected people, complete information on asse\nts affected and compensated, compensation rate vs amount of compensation paid, any o\nther cash allowance (transition or support); the gap or difference between compensation \npaid and full replacement cost; date paid and outstanding payments;  \no  Identify vulnerable groups and individuals who may be disproportionally affected by the P\nroject including those who are at risk of re-establishing livelihoods and/or commercial ent\nerprises as a result of the Project;  \no  In case presence and impact to ethnic and sub-ethnic groups is confirmed, review earlier\n engagement with ethnic groups affected by the Project and assess whether such engag\nement complies with the requirements on consent through broad community support as r\nequired under ADB\u2019s SPS SR3 on Indigenous Peoples; \no  Determine any land and ROW acquisition impacts, any adverse environment, community\n health and safety impacts to ethnic minorities in the nearby communities and assess me\nasures taken against ADB\u2019s SPS SR3 on Indigenous Peoples; \no  Develop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) with follow-up corrective measures and impleme\nntation plan details, parameters and outcome indicators to comply with applicable standa\nrds.    \n\uf0b7  Where it is found, in Phase 1, that land is or will be acquired in the future specifically for the \nProject the Consultant prepare a Resettlement Plan (RP) or Livelihoods Restoration Plan\n (LRP, if all impacts are found to be related to economic displacement) compliant to SPS SR\n2 requirements. This will include a review of all land requirements of the Project, permanent \nand temporary, and identify assets affected during pre-construction, construction and operati\nons phase of the Project. Identify any impacts to assets and livelihoods as a result of environ\nmental media in the upstream and downstream of the Project. Identify all forest land, unregis\ntered land or state-owned land which fall within the Project footprint and determine if they are\n under productive use by private individuals or communities and assess the potential for eco\nnomic or physical displacement. Specific guidance on the requirements for the development \n ", "21 \nof an ADB compliant RP is available in the ADB SPS 2009. \n4.  DELIVERABLES AND TIMELINE \nIt is anticipated that the Consultant will submit the draft Scoping Report within 8 weeks of the date \nof engagement. This Scoping Report is to include a detailed plan with expected timeline for \ncompletion  of  Phase  2a  and  2b  tasks  and  deliverables.  Timing  of  surveys  and  baseline \nsampling/monitoring should be clearly stated, with reference to local, seasonal conditions.  \n \n5.  EXPERTISE REQUIRED \nThe  Consultant  should  be  familiar  with  the  Assessment  Framework,  including  gender  and \ndevelopment aspects.

INTRODUCTION \n \nHydro  Developments  Pty  Ltd  is  developing  a  mini  hydropower  project  and  an  associated \ntransmission system (the Project) aimed at supplying renewable energy to Taveuni and Vanua \nLevu Islands in northern Fiji as an Independent Power Project or IPP. The Project will include mini \nhydropower generating plants with capacities of 4000kW and 2000kW. The larger plant is on \nnative land near the villages of Lavena and the smaller one is on freehold land at Salialevu Estate. \nThe Project includes 75km of 33kV transmission line and a 9km long submarine to deliver \nelectricity  from  Lavena  hydro  plant  via  a  33/11kV  substation  at  Wairiki,  to  a  defined \ninterconnection point southwest of Labasa with subsidiary offtake at Wairiki and at Savusavu. An \n66kV transmission line 115km long would deliver electricity from Salialevu mini hydro plant to \nelectricity cooperatives and private agricultural consumers in south Taveuni, and also connected \nto Wairiki substation for onward transmission to Vanua Levu. \n \nThrough its local subsidiary Hydro Taveuni Pte Ltd, in October 2020 Hydro Developments \nsubmitted a bid to EFL for the supply of up to 40GWh/year of renewable energy to Vanua Levu. \nIn March 2021 the company was selected to sign a non-disclosure agreement with EFL to share \ninformation  and  to  provide  further  information  on  Project  cost,  and  particularly  that  of  the \ndedicated transmission system needed.  \n \nAll the proposed works will be subject to engineering feasibility study and to an Environmental \nand Social impact Assessment to be carried out in accordance with Fiji Government law and with \nADB Safeguards requirements. Following Phase 1 of the feasibility study to be completed in \nSeptember 2021, the Project will be presented to EFL for acceptance after which negotiations \nwould commence in relation to a PPA and a possible minor shareholding by EFL in the Project \ncompany equity. Phase 2 would comprise all additional work to complete the development phase \nand to be ready to start construction by 1 July 2022. \n \n2.
