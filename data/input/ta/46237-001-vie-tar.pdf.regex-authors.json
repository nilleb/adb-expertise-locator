INTRODUCTION \n1.  In October 2011, at the Partnership Assembly Meeting in Istanbul, several countries, \nincluding Viet Nam, submitted an expression of interest to participate in the Partnership for \nMarket Readiness (PMR) program, a grant-based capacity building trust fund that provides \nfunding  and  technical  assistance  for  collective  innovation  and  piloting  of  market-based \ninstruments for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. To promote innovation and provide a \nplatform for technical discussion, the PMR brings together developed and developing countries, \nas well as other key experts and stakeholders, in particular to foster South\u2013South exchange on \nhow to improve mitigation action. At the PMR 2011 meeting, Viet Nam requested that the \nPartnership Assembly approve the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as its main delivery partner \nand the World Bank as its co-delivery partner in carrying out PMR activities. \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) supports the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s National Target \nProgram for responding to climate change, the National Climate Change Strategy, as well as \nViet Nam\u2019s proposed strategy for green growth. A TA fact-finding mission visited Viet Nam and \nreached an agreement with the government on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, activities, cost, \nimplementation and financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In Viet Nam, strong economic growth and industrialization after the financial crisis of \n1997 was largely fuelled by intense exploitation of natural resources. Viet Nam\u2019s industrial \ngrowth has driven annual increases in energy consumption and corresponding greenhouse gas \nemissions. In 2008, growth in energy consumption was 11.3%, a consistent trend after the 1997 \ncrisis. Resource consumption comprises primarily oil and coal, and amounts to 28,479 kilotons \nof oil equivalent. If this trend continues as projected, with Viet Nam continuing its heavy reliance \non fossil fuels, national greenhouse gas emissions (which were 177 tons of carbon dioxide \nequivalent in 2005) will triple by 2030. Moreover, Viet Nam\u2019s per capita energy consumption is \nprojected to reach 5,400 kilowatt-hours by 2030, up from 985 kilowatt-hours in 2010. Currently, \n52% of electricity consumption is from the industry and business sectors, 39% from residential \nareas,  and  8%  from  agriculture.  The  large  increase  in  energy  demand  and  requisite \ninfrastructure investment required to satisfy energy needs in an environmentally sustainable \nmanner poses a significant challenge, particularly given Viet Nam\u2019s significant exposure to \nclimate change impacts. Increased temperatures and reduced dry season rainfall will increase \npower demand for cooling and pumping. In the medium term, the government's plans to meet \nthese growing needs include a mix of new coal and hydropower projects.  \n \n4.  The magnitude of the challenge is daunting, and an estimated $40 billion will be required \nto meet the growing energy needs in Viet Nam while transitioning to a low-carbon path. Current \nplans estimate that, by 2015, energy demand will be met through coal, hydropower, and natural \ngas, increasingly supplemented by nuclear and renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, \nand small-scale hydropower. The government has committed to transition to market-oriented \npricing that will reduce the demand for coal compared to cleaner-burning natural gas and other \nenergy sources. Specific initiatives include the following:  \n(i)  The Law on Environmental Protection Tax, which came into effect January 2012, \naims at using an indirect tax for products and goods which, when used, have \nnegative impacts on the environment.2  \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 January 2013.  \n2  This law was adopted under Decision No. 57/2010/QH12. \n ", "2   \n(ii)  The Green Growth Strategy approved in September 2012, has three focus areas: \n(a) reducing greenhouse gases, particularly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfor energy activities by 10% (20% with international support) for 2011\u20132020 and \nby  30%  (45%  with  international  support)  for  2020\u20132030  compared  with  the \nbusiness-as-usual scenario, (b) greening production, and (c) green lifestyle.3   \n(iii)  The Law on Energy Efficiency and Conservation, effective since January 2011, \nensures energy security.4 \n(iv)  Viet Nam\u2019s action programs for energy efficiency and large-scale development of \nrenewable energy sources, which have three medium- to long-term objectives: (a) \nto  reduce  energy  consumption  per  gross  domestic  product  by  at  least          \n2.5%\u20133.0% per year by 2020; (b) to reduce total greenhouse gases relative to \nbusiness-as-usual by 2%\u20133% per year from 2020 to 2030; and (c) to increase the \nshare of renewable energies in the total power generation mix to 5.6% in 2020 \nand  11.0%  in  2050,  of  which  20,000\u201322,000  megawatts  is  planned  from \nhydropower and 1,600 megawatts from biomass.  \n \n5.  Changes in pricing are likely to provide some incentives for clean reliable energy. There \nis a need to mobilize financial resources from all possible channels, including carbon market \nmechanisms. In November 2010, the United Nations Secretary General's High Level Advisory \nGroup  on  Climate  Change  Financing  presented  a  report  on  potential  financial  sources  to \nsupport  developing  countries  in  addressing  climate  change.  The  report  identified  carbon \nmarkets as one of the feasible ways to scale up long-term financing to plug the existing gap in \ninternational climate financing for developing countries to address climate change. \n \n6.  With this background, the Clean Development Mechanism approach has demonstrated \nthe role market instruments can play in the carbon market by supporting the cost-effective \nreduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  channeling  mitigation  finance  to  developing \ncountries. It is widely recognized that it is necessary to increase the participation of developing \ncountries in the carbon market. Expansion of the existing carbon market and introduction of new \nmarket-based mechanisms requires improved international awareness on the role of market-\nbased mechanisms, as well as increased national and international capacity for designing, \nimplementing, and overseeing such mechanisms in developing countries. To effectively scale-\nup international carbon markets, a well-designed and structured approach to capacity building \nneeds to be adopted. To facilitate these efforts, the PMR program was launched at the 16th \nConference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \nCancun,  Mexico  in  2010.  The  PMR  is  intended  to  help  interested  countries  reach  these \nobjectives, and it was decided at the outset that the World Bank would act as trustee of the \nPMR activities and administer the PMR Multi-Donor Trust Fund with an aim of $100 million in \ncontributions from the various donor countries. The 16 countries that volunteered to participate \nin this initiative are Brazil, Chile, People\u2019s Republic of China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, \nIndonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, Peru,5 South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Viet \nNam.  \n \n7.  The  PMR  has  two  phases:  (i)  the  preparation  phase  for  preparing  the  organizing \nframework and the market readiness proposal (MRP), which details the country\u2019s plan for its \n                                                \n3  The strategy was approved by the Prime Minister on 25 September 2012 and encourages economic sectors to \npromote energy efficiency and use natural resources with high added value. \n4  The law was adopted under Decision No. 50/2010/QH12. \n5  Initially the PMR was limited to 15 countries and Peru only joined in October 2012 with the understanding that its \nparticipation will be fully financed through funding from Switzerland, which will cover the costs associated with \nfunding for Peru\u2019s preparation phase and implementation phase, as well as associated World Bank costs.  \n ", "  3 \nproposed  market-based  instrument(s)  and  market  readiness  components,  and  (ii)  the \nimplementation phase for piloting the proposed market instrument(s) where possible. Viet Nam, \nalong  with  four  other  countries,  submitted  an  organizing  framework  in  May  2012  for \nconsideration  by  the  Partnership  Assembly,  which  approved  it  and  allocated  funding  of \n$315,000  at  its  third  meeting  held  in  Cologne,  Germany.  This  funding  will  support  the \nformulation of the MRP and complete the preparation phase. \n \n8.  Viet Nam intends to initially apply market-based instruments to selected sectors with a \nview to broadening the scope over time and achieve broad-based carbon pricing. Under the TA, \nthis approach to developing market-based instruments in Viet Nam will be supported by \n(i)  studying and deploying potential market-based instruments in steel, solid waste \nmanagement, and power (energy efficiency) industries; \n(ii)  integrating market-based instruments in the development of planning and policy \nand coordination to assess their use in mainstreaming green growth; \n(iii)  further developing a draft proposal on greenhouse gas emissions management \nusing market-based mechanisms and establishing and managing a monitoring, \nreporting, and verification (MRV) system; and \n(iv)  preparing emission profiles, preparing business-as-usual scenarios (for cities), \nand identifying emission reduction options including approval and implementation \nof nationally appropriate mitigation actions and market-based instruments and \nMRV systems for sectors and regions. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The expected TA impact will be piloting of market-based instruments for greenhouse gas \nemissions reduction in Viet Nam. The outcome will be the MRP is endorsed by the Government \nof Viet Nam for presentation to the Partnership Assembly in the first half of 2014. The TA will \nassist  the  country  in  preparing  the  MRP  and,  if  successful,  will  prepare  the  project  for \nimplementation. The key highlights of the proposal are Viet Nam\u2019s national plan for its proposed \ncrediting mechanisms, market-based instrument(s), and market readiness components, and the \nfinancing needs for the implementation phase. \n \n10.  The TA will also contribute to fulfilling the goals set by the National Target Program in \naddressing climate change issues within  the context of poverty alleviation and sustainable \ndevelopment. By developing its market readiness and using market mechanisms (in particular, a \nnew scaled-up greenhouse gas crediting mechanism), Viet Nam will be better positioned to \nsupport its strategy on green growth and introduce clean technologies.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  To prepare the MRP in line with the guidelines set forth by the Partnership Assembly, \nunder the TA (i) a participatory and consultative approach will be adopted in project planning, \ndesign,  and  implementation  to  ensure  strong  ownership;  (ii)  where  necessary,  formal \nagreements will be adopted to define key responsibilities; and (iii) existing networks will be \ntapped to identify and engage qualified experts for the project. ADB will be the main delivery \npartner for the government, with the World Bank as co-delivery partner in implementing the \nactivities under this TA. \n \n ", "4   \n12.  The MRP will be developed on a sector-specific basis and will build on the country\u2019s \nexisting initiatives to meet nationally defined priorities. The methodology for developing the MRP \nwill include (i) carrying out a feasibility and capacity assessment for utilizing market mechanisms \nin the context of the country\u2019s mitigation strategies; (ii) improving data collection systems and \ninstitutional capacity for data reporting and management and for setting up activity reference \nlevels;  and  (iii)  designing  or  enhancing  existing  MRV  frameworks  to  ensure  transparency, \nquality, credibility, and consistency with international good practice. \n \n13.  A  team  of consultants will  support  the government focal  points  responsible  for  the \nPMR\u2015the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  (MONRE)  and  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning and Investment (MPI). The preparation of a comprehensive MRP for Viet Nam will \nfocus specifically on (i) central coordination, organization, communication, consultation, and \nengagement; (ii)  overview  of  the  country  policy  context  and  mitigation  objective;  (iii)  MRV \nelements;  (iv)  the  regulatory  and  institutional  framework;  and  (v)  scaled-up  crediting \nmechanisms, emission trading system principles, and design of pilot activities (e.g., energy \nefficiency measures in selected cities). At the Partnership Assembly meeting in May 2012, the \ngovernment\u2019s  organizing  framework  proposed  three  pilot  crediting  mechanisms:  (i)  energy \nefficiency in the power industry, (ii) industrial energy efficiency in the steel industry, and (iii) solid \nwaste management.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $346,500 of which, $315,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Partnership for Market Readiness Multi-Donor Trust Fund6 and administered by \nADB. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  MPI will be the executing agency, although implementation will be co-led by the MPI and \nMONRE in the preparation phase in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which \noversees  the  power  and  steel  industries  in  Viet  Nam.  Interministerial  coordination  and \nconsistency of the government\u2019s sector strategies and related policies will be managed and \nmonitored through frequent interministerial dialogues. The TA implementation period is from \nJune 2013 to June 2014.   \n \n16.  The overall MRP preparation is envisaged to consist of two distinct activities executed by \na firm engaged using the fixed-budget selection method with a lump-sum contract. This method \nis preferred as the budget is fixed and cannot be exceeded, and it minimizes the risk for ADB. In \nits proposal, the consultant will prepare a budget to carry out the required tasks. The activity-\nbased budget will be linked to clear outputs and services. Payments will be made in installments \nbased on the delivery of the contractually agreed deliverables. It is estimated that 10 person-\nmonths  of  international  consultant  services  and  10  person-months  of  national  consultant \nservices  will  be  required.  Consultant  engagement  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2010,  as  amended from  time to time). The  detailed  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n17.  The consultants will support the MPI and MONRE in the preparation of a comprehensive \nproposal for Viet Nam, focusing on (i) project coordination, (ii) mitigation options for priority \n                                                \n6  Established by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as trustee.  \n ", "  5 \nsectors to be determined during the TA, (iii) market-based instruments, and (iv) design of pilot \nactivities (e.g., energy efficiency measures in the steel industry). Where mitigation options are \ndeemed suitable for elaboration into nationally appropriate mitigation action(s) that may be \nscaled-up for crediting and/or trading mechanisms, the team will convene consultations with \nstakeholders and experts in the designated sectors.  \n \n18.  The project will be country-led and build on nationally defined and prioritized mitigation \npolicies according to its national circumstances. The TA will also coordinate with a number of \ncountries  that  have  initiated  comprehensive  country-specific  studies  to  assess  their \ndevelopment goals and priorities, in conjunction with mitigation opportunities. By doing this, the \nPMR will synergize with other readiness efforts to avoid duplication and ensure effective use of \nresources. The PMR should complement and coordinate with the relevant initiatives at both the \ninternational and national levels. To ensure comprehensive and consistent approaches, the \nPMR will collaborate with other agencies as needed through workshops and donor coordination \nmeetings under the guidance of the MPI and MONRE.  \n \n19.  Consultant mobilization is expected for the second quarter of 2013. During preparation of \nthe MRP, ADB and the World Bank will organize meetings under the auspices of the MPI and \nMONRE to gather feedback. ADB and World Bank staff assigned in Viet Nam will oversee \nconsultants\u2019 work and provide monitoring and technical support. The draft final MRP endorsed \nby the government will be submitted to the PMR Secretariat for the expert group feedback \nprocess.7 This  process  allows  the  participating  country  to  revise  the  draft  MRP  with  the \nfeedback received and to address outstanding issues prior to its formal submission for securing \nimplementation funding from the Partnership Assembly. The government\u2019s presentation of the \ndraft MRP to the Partnership Assembly is targeted for no later than May 2014.8  \n \nIV.  THE RANKING VICE-PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The  Ranking  Vice-President,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, and acting under the authority \ndelegated by the Board, has approved ADB administering technical assistance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $315,000 to the Government of Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by \nthe  Partnership  for  Market  Readiness  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  for  Developing  the  Market \nReadiness Proposal for a Domestic Carbon Market, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n7  The  expert  group  feedback is  a  process designed  to  give  implementing  country  participants  an additional \nperspective on their proposed activities for PMR support and, ultimately, to strengthen their overall proposals. In \naddition to electronic communication between the experts and the implementing country participant, the PMR \nSecretariat will finance one member of an expert group to conduct an in-country meeting as part of the overall \nfeedback process. The implementing country participant will also mobilize its own resources to offset the cost of \nexpert visits, particularly if it wishes to have more than one expert visit during the feedback process. \n8  As a standard rule, all implementing country participants are required to present their final MRP no later than 2 \nyears after approval of the expression of interest. In Viet Nam\u2019s case, this implies a deadline of May 2014 as the \nexpression of interest was submitted in May 2012.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n  DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nReadiness of market- By 2018:  MRP implementation  The government\u2019s \nbased instruments for  Capacity and framework  reports by the  commitment to address \ngreenhouse gas  for data collection and  Government of Viet Nam  climate change as an \nemissions reduction  greenhouse gas  integral part of \nNational communication \nin Viet Nam  accounting enhanced  development planning \nto the UNFCCC and \ncontinues \nBaselines and mitigation  ministerial and national \n \ntargets for the relevant  greenhouse gas \nThe government \nsectors established  inventories  \ncontinues to develop its \nMRV systems for market    PMR project proposal \ninstruments implemented   \n \nRisks \n \n \n    Financial and regulatory \nmechanisms designed \nto support greenhouse \ngas emission reductions \nin response to climate \nchange are not \nsupported \n \nCounterpart agencies \ndo not invest in staff \nresources that will \nensure that the \ninformation systems \nneeded for a \ngreenhouse gas \nemissions registry are \nmaintained \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nThe MRP is endorsed  By June 2014:  Submissions to the PMR  Different levels of \nby the Government of  Each stage of the MRP  Secretariat  government are able to \nViet Nam   preparation proposal has    agree on PMR proposal \nbeen endorsed by the    elements \nPartnership Assembly     \n    Continuity of the \nADB receives the grant  Communications of the   executing agencies \nfund transfer agreement  PMR Secretariat  during PMR \nfrom the Partnership  implementation \nAssembly to implement the   \nMRP preparation phase of  Risks \nthe PMR project   \nPMR objectives \n   \nbecome incompatible \n    with the government's \neconomic or social \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \ndevelopment goals \n \nPMR participation is \ndeemed politically or \nsocially unacceptable \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \nThe MRP and related  MRV system designed by  PMR website and MPI  Timely access and \nactivities for the  September 2013  and MONRE reports  effective collaboration \npreparation phase    between MPI and \nare completed as per  Final draft MRP workshop  MONRE \nstandard PMR  held by January 2014   \nguidelines    Risk \nDraft MRP circulation by   \nMarch 2014  Timing delays in \n    proposal preparation \n \n Activities with Milestones  Inputs \n \n1.

Activity 1: Central Coordination, Communication, Consultation, and Management \n \n1.  Objective \n \n1.  A team of consultants will be recruited through a firm to support the Ministry of Planning \nand  Investment  (MPI)  and  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  (MONRE)  in \npreparing a comprehensive market readiness proposal (MRP) for Viet Nam, building on the \nPMR organizing framework submitted by the Government of Viet Nam in May 2012 at the \nPartnership Assembly meeting in Cologne, Germany. The consultants will focus on the central \ncoordination, communication, consultation, and management activities for the preparation of \nViet  Nam\u2019s  proposal  and  will  prepare  a  draft  MRP,  and  subsequently  a  final  MRP.1 It  is \nestimated that 10 person-months of international consultant services and 10 person-months of \nnational consultant services will be required to deliver the outputs. \n \n2.  Scope of Work \n \n2.  The consultants\u2019 scope of work will include the tasks outlined in the paras below.  \n \n3.  Coordinate activities related to greenhouse gas management in Viet Nam. The firm \nwill assign one consultant as the project coordinator who will support MONRE and MPI in \ncoordinating and implementing activities related to greenhouse gas management in Viet Nam. \nThe coordinator will concurrently be responsible for reviewing, coordinating, and supervising \nimplementation of the studies prepared in support of the MRP by various consultants. The \ncoordinator will review the progress of the tasks in this program, organize and arrange meetings \nand workshops as required, and ensure that all tasks are completed as per requirements, timing, \nand overall agreed approach.  \n \n4.  This task includes communication and consultation in support of preparation of the MRP \namong line ministries, development partners, and civil society. To report project progress and \nreview approaches, the coordinator will regularly consult with and receive feedback from the \njoint Asian Development Bank\u2013World Bank task team and the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s PMR \nfocal points. The coordinator will also support the government in preparing the PMR feedback \nprocess and coordinate queries, comments, and suggestions that may be communicated by the \nPMR expert group and participants.  \n \n5.  Develop the country policy context analysis. The firm will provide a comprehensive \nanalysis of the country\u2019s broader development and climate change mitigation objectives. The \nassessment will follow the outline of the Tool for MRP building block 1 and build on existing data \nand studies to avoid duplication (footnote 1). \n \n6.
