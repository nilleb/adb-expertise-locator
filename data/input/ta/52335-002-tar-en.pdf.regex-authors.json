THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The proposed Support for Human and Social Development in Southeast Asia (Phase 2), \na regional transaction technical assistance (TA) facility, will provide project preparatory support \nand capacity building to a series of ensuing projects in the human and social development (HSD) \nsectors in Southeast Asia developing member countries (DMCs), initially comprising those listed \nin Appendix 1. The initial focus will be on programs and projects included in country operations \nbusiness plans up to 20231 and assistance to implementation of ongoing projects. The TA facility \nwill contribute to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) response to Southeast Asian DMCs\u2019 \nemerging needs brought about by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It will support \nevidence-based  policy  and  technical  advice  and  build  capacity  under  selected  ongoing \nprograms/projects which are facing challenges in implementing reforms. It will also support \nanalysis and knowledge sharing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across Southeast \nAsian DMCs, which will also be used in preparing programs and projects. While phase 1 of the \nTA facility supported regular projects in the pre-COVID-19 period, phase 2 will focus on preparing \nCOVID-19 and post-COVID-19 recovery responses. Drawing upon lessons from phase 1, phase \n2 will ensure ADB responds with greater flexibility to DMCs\u2019 emerging needs for short- and \nmedium-term investment and knowledge in HSD sectors. \n \n2.  Solutions that are aligned with Strategy 2030 during the post-pandemic period. The \nTA facility will support priority HSD projects and programs in the Southeast Asian DMCs during \nand after the pandemic and address critical common challenges across the region. It is aligned \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  and  its  operational  priority  1  (addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing inequalities) and operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality).2 The \nfacility will help to generate quality jobs, strengthen human capital, improve health for all, and \nprovide  more  social  protection  for  those  in  need.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  widened \ndisparities in  societies  because  of  the  inequitable  access to  health care services  including \nvaccines, social protection, and social assistance. Access to distance education and training \nduring school closures has also been unequal. The TA facility will foster several cross-cutting \npriorities as appropriate to the context of specific projects, including gender mainstreaming, \nregional cooperation and integration, climate change risk mitigation and adaption, innovative \nfinancing modalities, technology-enabled solutions, stronger system preparedness and resilience \nfor future emergencies, and private sector engagement. It will help DMCs to mobilize domestic \nand cofinancing resources and promote knowledge partnerships. The facility will enable ADB to \nrespond to demand for project preparatory activities in a timely and effective manner, provide \noversight, and address emerging capacity gaps in project implementation. It will reduce the \nnumber of stand-alone TA projects and take advantage of similar due diligence and consulting \nservice  requirements  across  projects,  thereby  enhancing  efficiency  in  project  preparation, \nimproving project readiness, and expediting implementation. Synergy with other TA projects being \ncarried out by the Southeast Asia Department and by other ADB departments will ensure that \nHSD priorities are addressed in a holistic manner and duplication is minimized.3  \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

COVID-19\u2019s  severe impact  on  labor  markets  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  COVID-19 \npandemic has had an unprecedented impact on labor markets in Southeast Asia and elsewhere \nboth directly through lockdown measures resulting in firm closures and work stoppages, and \nindirectly through decreases in aggregate demand and disruptions to the supply chain. Compared \nto the pre-pandemic period, the jobs gap in Asia and the Pacific region is estimated at 81 million \ndue to the crisis, out of which 13 million is accounted for by Southeast Asian countries.4 The crisis \nhas affected workers across the board, particularly vulnerable groups. These include women, \nyouth, workers in the informal sector, and self-employed workers, all of whom have very limited \naccess to social protection. Many members of these groups either live in poverty or run the risk \nof falling into poverty. Stringent policy measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, although \nnecessary, have affected the informal sector\u2019s potential to absorb displaced labor from the formal \nsector. The pandemic has also had a disproportionate impact on sectors such as construction, \ntransportation, and tourism. It also had an unprecedented adverse impact on manufacturing, \nfinance, real estate, education, as well as public administration.5 Wages in many countries have \neither stagnated or declined during the pandemic. In Southeast Asia, the estimated drop in labor \nincome, before considering income support measures as part of the governments\u2019 fiscal stimulus \nmeasures,  stood  at  9.5%  (footnote  4).  The  COVID-19  pandemic  threatens  to  reverse  the \nimportant gains that have been made in poverty reduction over the past decade. ADB will provide \nsupport to Southeast Asian DMCs to conduct in-depth analysis of the pandemic\u2019s impact on jobs, \nand its implications on vulnerable populations. It will also assist in developing inclusive policy \nmeasures and investment plans, including the use of digital technologies and big data analytics \nto improve real-time labor market data. \n  \n4.  Learning losses and inequality in education and skills development. The COVID-19 \npandemic has disrupted the traditional education model with most schools in Southeast Asian \nDMCs being closed for at least part of the time and many students having to resort to distance \neducation. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has estimated \nthat two-thirds of an academic year was lost on average worldwide due to school closures during \nthe  COVID-19  pandemic.6 The  already  existing  digital  divide  worsened  by  the  COVID-19 \npandemic has now exacerbated existing inequalities, with more affluent students having better \naccess to the technology necessary for online learning. Students from the poorest quintile are at \nhigh risk of dropping out from schools. There are growing concerns that students in geographically \nisolated and disadvantaged areas and those without access to the internet or household support \nfor  learning  have  been  disproportionately  affected  by  school closures, resulting in learning-\nlosses with compounding impacts  over time.  Disrupted  learning  will  have  adverse  long-term \nimpacts on the affected students, and eventually, on every country\u2019s workforce and productivity. \nADB will support learning continuity during the pandemic and will assist DMCs in using technology \nsolutions to improve the quality and delivery of education and skills development. Southeast Asian \ncountries  need  to  become  more  knowledge-driven  and  to  invest  in  high-quality  science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics education for their youth. In the age of the fourth \nindustrial revolution, ADB will support DMCs  to equip their young people and workers with \nadvanced  skills  and  competencies  to  meet  labor  market  demands  for  skills  in  emerging \ntechnologies. This will, in turn, leverage technological transformation for innovation and higher \neconomic growth.  \n \n \n4  International Labour Organization (ILO). 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic has put the health systems \nof Southeast Asian countries under intense pressure and exposed some long-term weaknesses. \nDMC governments have mobilized substantial financial and human resources for their emergency \nresponse to the pandemic, by scaling up testing capacities, establishing mobility tracking systems, \nand improving isolation and treatment facilities. While the key challenge now is to secure and \ndeploy  COVID-19  vaccines,  on  the  supply  side  DMCs\u2019  health  systems  have  been  facing \nchallenges in ensuring capacity and quality of care. The gap is particularly significant in health \nhuman resources, at both technical and management levels. In addition to understaffing, the \nquality of health care is constrained by low levels of technical training and a high turnover of \nprimary care staff, including contract and volunteer workers. ADB will assist DMCs to utilize digital \ntools and big data analytics to improve real-time intelligence in monitoring and tracking diseases, \nan essential aid for effective pandemic response. ADB will support DMCs to strengthen digital \nhealth information systems with interoperability to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of \npublic health management in general. Blockchain technology presents opportunities to enhance \ndata security and distributed information registration. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had \nuneven impacts on populations and temporarily affected some routine health services. In the post-\npandemic period, health systems need to be considerably strengthened to transition toward \nuniversal health coverage. ADB\u2019s support will focus on sustainable health financing, green health \ninfrastructure, enhanced preparedness for future health emergencies due to infectious disease \n \noutbreaks or extreme climate events, and regional health security. \n \n6.  Gaps in social protection. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed and magnified major \ngaps in social protection, compromising the economic, and health status of households in the \nprocess. Less than half of the population in Asia and the Pacific is covered by a social protection \nscheme.7 Southeast Asia has among the lowest coverage, with social protection reaching only \n33% of the population. Similarly, expenditure on social protection remains low, averaging 4.9% of \ngross domestic product for Asia and the Pacific and  only 2.7% in Southeast Asia.8 These \ncoverage gaps and low levels of investment mean that many vulnerable groups, including children, \nyouth, women, the elderly, disabled persons, indigenous people, and those working in the informal \nsector, are often excluded from social protection programs. Without access to adequate social \nprotection,  including  social  assistance  for  the  most  vulnerable  groups,  paid  sick  leave, \nunemployment insurance, or pensions, most informal workers have been disproportionately and \nadversely  impacted  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  For  most  Southeast  Asian  DMCs,  social \nprotection systems remain underdeveloped, making it harder to identify and reach those most in \nneed. DMCs have great potential to develop stronger social protection systems to build resilience \nand promote inclusive growth by increasing the level of protection, and by upgrading their social \nprotection infrastructure, including identification, registration, and delivery systems. ADB will \nsupport DMCs to expand the coverage of social protection, promote innovations in targeting and \npayment systems, strengthen implementation  and monitoring capacity, and  integrate social \nprotection with sustainable livelihoods and human capital development.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Preparation of human and social development projects strengthened. The TA \nfacility will provide technical support to all Southeast Asian DMCs to prepare HSD investment projects \nand programs. This will include due diligence covering technical, fiduciary, safeguards, social, and \ninstitutional  dimensions;  economic  and  financial  analysis;  and  measures  to  strengthen  project \n \n7  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and ILO. 2020.

Specific activities will include the preparation of: (i) feasibility \nstudies; (ii) economic analysis; (iii) financial management assessment, financial evaluation, and \nanalysis; (iv) strategic procurement planning and procurement assessment; (v) gender action plans; \n(vi)  risk  assessment  and  management  plans;  (vii)  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples\u2019 safeguard documents; (viii) sector assessments; (ix) poverty and social analysis; \nand (x) climate change assessments. Where high-level and green technology is planned, feasibility \nof the technology will be assessed. The indicative list of projects covering 2021\u20132023 is in Appendix \n1.  \n \n8.  Output 2: Evidence-based policy and technical advice and capacity building for \nproject  implementation  supported.  The  TA  facility  will  provide  demand-driven  policy  and \ntechnical advice and capacity building to support policy, institutional, and program reforms to \nensure effective project implementation and to institutionalize project gains. It will also support \nquality  assurance  mechanisms  and  systems  such  as  verification  of  disbursement-linked \nindicators, and build the capacity of government staff for procurement, financial management, \nsafeguards, gender actions, and monitoring.  The TA facility will support research and data \nanalytical capacity development for evidence-based policy actions in health, education and skills \ndevelopment, technical and vocational education and training, labor market analysis, and social \nprotection. It will also strengthen collaboration between the government and national or regional \ninstitutions and industry.  \n \n9.  Output 3: Diagnostic and knowledge development and sharing among countries in \nthe Southeast Asian region enhanced. The TA facility will support in-depth analysis to improve \nthe quality of the design and readiness of the ensuing projects and programs and to assist DMCs \nto explore future investment opportunities. It will identify deep-rooted issues in HSD sectors which \naffect vulnerable populations and which COVID-19 has exacerbated. It will also support promotion \nof innovations in such areas as technology adaption, private sector engagement, financing \nmodalities,  and climate change  adaptation  and mitigation.  The  TA facility  will  also support \nknowledge sharing beyond Southeast Asian DMCs by supporting knowledge exchange to tackle \ncommon challenges in HSD sector development in collaboration with other ADB departments. \nKnowledge sharing and dissemination activities will be encouraged through webinars, training, \nworkshops, and national and regional conferences between DMCs and across ADB thematic \ngroups. Effective information, education, and communication tools using infographics and social \nmedia will be utilized to reach targeted audiences, especially women and youth. All publications \nand knowledge products will be disseminated electronically.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $3,500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1,500,000 from TASF-7 and $2,000,000 from TASF-\nother sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The TA facility may be \nreplenished as funds are required or as cofinancing from trust funds become available.  \n \n11.  The DMC governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice space and supplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. Governments \nwill be informed that approval of the TA facility does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject.  \n \n \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The Human and Social Development Division of ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department will \nbe the executing agency and administer the TA facility. Activities under output 1 will commence \nonly after ADB approves the concept papers for the ensuing projects. Activities under outputs 2 \nand 3 may commence upon TA facility approval. In-country activities will start once no-objection \nfrom DMC governments has been obtained.  \n \n13.  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  consultant  recruitment  in  consultation  with  participating \ngovernments.9 Concurrence  from  participating  governments  will  be  sought  for  shortlisting \nconsultants.  Close  coordination  will  be  maintained  with  ADB  resident  missions,  other \ndevelopment  partners,  and  relevant  regional  organizations  during  implementation.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements  \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  September 2021\u2013September 2024  \nperiod \nExecuting agency  ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \n  Firm(s): QCBS (90:10)  Project Preparation  $0.93 million \n  Individual: ICS   International (59 person-months)  $1.07 million \n  Individual: ICS   National (117 person-months)  $0.79 million \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  All goods procured will be turned over to the concerned DMC or \narrangement upon TA  appropriately disposed of by ADB based on its Administrative Order on Asset \ncompletion  Management and Inventory Control.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMC = developing member country, ICS = individual consultant selection,  \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA = technical assistance.  \nSource: ADB. \n \n14.  Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and associated staff instructions.10 One or more firm(s) will \nbe engaged to provide consultants to conduct due diligence, including: (i) environment and \nclimate change specialist; (ii) social safeguard specialist; (iii) economic analysis and financial \nmanagement specialist; (iv) gender specialist; (v) monitoring and evaluation specialist; and (vi) \nprocurement specialist. Procurement consultants will also be engaged through the Procurement, \nPortfolio and Financial Management Department\u2019s existing framework agreements if appropriate \nexpertise is available. A framework agreement may also be explored for each due diligence expert \nas an alternative approach. In addition to firm selection, a significant number of consultants will \nbe recruited using the individual consultant selection method, because the TA facility will cover \nmultiple projects in five Southeast Asian DMCs for different sectors at various times from 2021 to \n2024 Individual consultants, including pool of experts to support the administration of COVID-19 \nvaccination and activities to promote universal health coverage, will be engaged for specialized \ntechnical positions. Such expertise often exists outside firms\u2019 networks and will be used to \ncomplement the mobilization of experts through firms. Consultants will be deployed based on the \nrequirements of each project being prepared and implemented. Resource persons and short-term \nconsultants will be engaged for specialized technical positions, analytical work, and knowledge \nsharing events as may be required by project team leaders.  \n \n9  Output-based lump-sum contracts will be considered for consulting services where applicable and relevant. \n10 The terms of reference for consultants are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3. \n ", "6   \nE.  Governance  \n \n15.  ADB is the executing agency, and thus the financial management, procurement, and \nintegrity risks during implementation are assessed to be low.
