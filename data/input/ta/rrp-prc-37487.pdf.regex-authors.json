An environmental impact assessment was completed and \nAssessment  the summary was circulated to the Board on 29 April 2005. \n   \nProject  The  Project  is  located  in  the  western  part  of  Henan  province  and \nDescription  southeastern  part  of  Shaanxi  province,  a  relatively  poor  area.  The \nProject  is  designed  to  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  by \nconstructing  459  kilometers  (km)  of  railway  line  from  Zhengzhou  in \nHenan to Xi\u2019an in Shaanxi. The Project will develop an efficient, safe, \nand environmentally sustainable railway transport system in the region; \nand facilitate creation of additional employment and income-generating \nopportunities, thus benefiting poor residents.  \n   \nRationale  The Project reflects the ADB railway sector operational strategy for the \nPRC,  which  includes  reducing  railway  network  constraints  and \npromoting sustainable economic growth in poor areas not served by \nrailways.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  western \ndevelopment  strategy  to  provide  less-developed  regions  with  better \ninfrastructure  to  facilitate  economic  growth,  thereby  increasing  the \nopportunity for people to improve their living standards.  \n \nThe  interior  regions  of  the  PRC  have  not  benefited  as  much  from \neconomic growth and reforms as the east coast; in fact, the gap in \neconomic and social development has increased. Transport constraints \nand high logistics costs are two factors contributing to regional economic \ndisparities, and two of the constraints preventing the western region \nfrom capitalizing on its comparative advantages. \n \nThe Project is one of the eight passenger-dedicated corridors to be \ndeveloped by 2020. The proposed alignment for the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an \nrailway (ZXR) is 50 km shorter than the existing Longhai railway line. \nTraversing Henan and Shaanxi, the proposed railway line will connect \nwith Beijing\u2013Guangzhou, Shanghai\u2013Xuzhou, and Beijing\u2013Wuhan main \nlines  on  the  east  and  Xi\u2019an\u2013Baoji\u2013Lanzhou,  Xi\u2019an\u2013Baoji\u2013Chengdu, \nXi\u2019an\u2013Ankang, and Xi\u2019an\u2013Yan\u2019an main lines on the west. This is the \nmain  east-west  corridor  linking  Beijing,  Shanghai,  Lianyungang,  and \nother major cities and ports in the east, to Xi\u2019an, Baoji, Lanzhou, Urumqi, \nChengdu, Chongqing, in the west. The Project will also help promote \nregional cooperation as this is the main east-west corridor linking the \nPRC to Central Asia and Europe. \n   \n  The Project, a joint-venture railway between the Ministry of Railways \n ", "iv   \n(MOR)  and  Henan  and  Shaanxi  provincial  governments  (HPG  and \nSPG),  will  have  substantial  managerial  and  financial  autonomy.  The \nProject will contribute to changing railway enterprises from cost centers \nin a planned economy to profit centers in an increasingly competitive \ntransport market. The components are formulated in line with MOR\u2019s \n2004 Railway Development Plan. \n   \nImpact and  The Project will remove a transport constraint to sustainable economic \nOutcome  growth. Providing economic railway transportation in the unserved, less-\ndeveloped, and poor areas will help create conditions necessary for \ndeveloping local resources and generating employment and income-\nenhancing opportunities to raise living standards in the project area.  \n \nProject  preparation  involved  participatory  processes.  Extensive \nconsultations were held with all the main stakeholders, including various \naffected people, potential beneficiaries, village leaders, women\u2019s groups, \nlocal  ethnic  bureaus,  and  local  governments  in  the  project  area. \nHousehold surveys were carried out, and participatory workshops were \norganized in the project area to understand public opinion about the \nProject,  and  to  provide  inputs  for  the  social  and  environmental \nassessments. \n \nThe Project comprises the following components: (i) construction of 459 \nkm  of  double-track  electrified  standard  gauge  class  I  passenger \ndedicated railway between Zhengzhou and Xi\u2019an; (ii) construction of 9 \nnew  railway  stations  complete  with  facilities;  (iii)  safety  initiatives, \nincluding provision of modern technology and equipment for enhancing \nsafety; (iv) e-governance and operating dispatch information system; (v) \nprovision of training on the use and maintenance of modern equipment; \n(vi) land acquisition and resettlement; (vii) environmental protection and \nmitigation of adverse environmental effects; (viii) consulting services for \nconstruction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and marketing and \nbusiness development; and (ix) strengthening of institutional capabilities. \nThe key inputs needed for project implementation include civil works, \nequipment, consultants, and staff of MOR and the Project Company.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost of the Project is estimated at $4,131.93 million \n  equivalent,  comprising  $1,364.61 million  in  foreign  exchange  and \n  $2,767.32 million equivalent in local currency. \n   \nFinancing Plan                                                    ($ million)\n    Foreign  Local  Total\n  Source  Exchange Currency  Cost\n  Asian Development Bank  400.00  0.00  400.00\nChina Development Bank  0.00  1,667.27  1,667.27\nMOR, HPG, SPG   964.61  1,110.05  2,064.66\nTotal  1,364.61  2,767.32  4,131.93\nPercent  33.00  67.00  100.00\n  HPG = Henan provincial government, MOR = Ministry of Railways, SPG = Shaanxi \nprovincial government,. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount  A loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nand Terms  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \n ", "  v\nlending facility. The loan will have a 26-year term including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2012 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated  31 December 2011 \nProject   \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting  Ministry of Railways \nAgency \n   \nImplementation  The  Foreign  Capital  and  Technical  Import  Center,  under  MOR,  will \nArrangements  coordinate the project management office's tasks and be responsible for \nprocurement,  withdrawals,  and  reporting  vis-\u00e0-vis  ADB.  The  Project \nCompany will manage and operate the project railway after completion \nof  the  construction;  and  develop  and  implement  adequate  and \ntransparent  business  development  mechanisms,  and  accounting  and \nreporting systems.  \n   \nProcurement  MOR will procure ADB-financed components in accordance with ADB \nGuidelines for Procurement. Other items will be procured in accordance \nwith government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n   \nConsulting  The ADB loan will finance 20 person-months of international consulting \nServices  services  for  (i) strengthening  institutional,  marketing,  and  business \ndevelopment functions of the Project Company; and (ii) researching and \nstrengthening  the  development,  operation,  and  management  of \npassenger-dedicated railway systems in the PRC. The consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. MOR will engage and finance 28,000 person-months of \ninternational  and  domestic  consulting  services  for  project  design, \nconstruction  supervision,  construction  quality  control,  environmental \nsupervision,  procurement,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nsafeguard  aspects  of  the  Project  in  accordance  with  government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nProject Benefits  The Project will (i) provide the shortest land route between Zhengzhou \nand Beneficiaries  and  Xi\u2019an,  key  centers  of  Henan  and  Shaanxi  provinces,  enabling \nrailway users to benefit from lower transport costs and shorter travel \ndistances  and  times;  (ii) increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity,  benefiting \nconsumers and producers of goods and services through the provision \nof  timely  and  efficient  transport  services  and  lower  logistics  costs; \n(iii) generate direct and indirect employment in the project-influenced \narea,  and  create  jobs  and  income-earning  opportunities  (the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  railway  will  employ  much  local \nunskilled labor); (iv) provide an area that lacked adequate cost-efficient \ntransportation services with access to broader markets; and (v) stimulate \nlocal development through tourism, railway station area development, \n ", "vi   \nand other infrastructure elements to maximize benefits to local areas.  \n \nThe increased tax revenues generated by the economic development \ninduced by the Project will help finance improved social service facilities \nand basic infrastructure. \n \nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) passengers, including tourists, \nwho will benefit from affordable, faster, and safer trips; (ii) freight users \nwho will switch from the existing road and benefit from more affordable, \nfaster, and safer trips; (iii) local residents who will benefit from the lower \nprices of commodities and services transported by the project railway; \n(iv) local labor involved in construction work and supply of materials \nduring implementation, and in loading/unloading during the operation of \nthe railway; (v) local farmers who will be able to sell their products at \nmarket prices without paying a high margin to a transport intermediary; \n(vi) local  manufacturers  and  traders  who  can  increase  production \ncapacity  or  establish  businesses,  and  will  transport  their  goods  and \nservices by the railway; and (vii) local governments, which will benefit \nfrom the increased opportunity for local area development and increased \nrevenues. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 9.3 million people living in the project area. \nThe poverty and social assessment looked at the 19 counties, of which \n17  are  rural  and  2  urban.  Six  counties  are  designated  national  or \nprovincial poverty counties. The 725 designated poverty villages have a \npopulation of about 1.3 million poor. About 90.2% of the beneficiaries \nlive in rural areas, and 15% are poor with an annual net income per \ncapita  of  less  than  CNY900.  The  links  between  poverty,  difficult \ntopography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the project area \nfor  the  proposed  ZXR.  Poverty  is  often  caused  by  geographic \nremoteness and isolation, limited transport access, high transport costs, \nand poor access to market information, as well as limited access to \nhealth, education, and other social services. \n   \n  The  Project  will  facilitate  the  creation  of  additional  employment  and \nincome-generating opportunities. About 353,000 person-years of work \nwill be created during construction. This will provide direct employment \nopportunities to over 70,000 poor people, including women and ethnic \nminorities. Railway station area development will increase incomes in \nlocal communities and help generate local revenues. The Project will \nfacilitate the development of local industry and tourism, which will help \ngenerate  additional  opportunities  in  the  future  for  local  people. \nConsultations with the local people in the project area indicated their \nstrong support for the Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  7.0% \nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the 3.0% weighted average cost \nof capital. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 17.4%.  \n   \nRisks and  The railway will be constructed in hilly and mountainous terrain, which is \nAssumptions  a significant technical challenge. The associated physical risks during \n  implementation include delays, cost overruns, worker health and safety, \n  and environmental impacts. These potential risks have been assessed \n ", "  vii\n  and appropriate mitigating measures provided. \n   \n  Resettlement will affect about 37,000 people. The railway alignment was \n  selected  to  minimize  resettlement,  where  possible.  The  resettlement \n  plan includes preferential treatment for employment during construction, \nsupply of local materials, allocation of commercial space near railway \nstations, and job training. Resettlement will be implemented by local \ngovernments and closely monitored and supervised. These measures \nwill mitigate the potential social risks associated with resettlement. \n \nIntermodal competition between railways and roads will create market \nrisks for the project railway. However, the existing railway and road is \nalready congested and the capacity constraint is expected to worsen. \nSurveys  of  passengers  found  that  the  railway  would  have  several \nadvantages  over  other  transport  modes:  lower  fares,  shorter  travel \ntimes, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of \nthe joint-venture railway will help to lessen the risks posed by intermodal \ncompetition. \n ", "", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an Railway (ZXR) Project. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n2.  From  1978,  when  economic  reforms  were  introduced,  through  to  2003,  the  PRC \nexperienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth.  This  exceptional  economic  performance \ncontinued in 2004 with economic growth rates of 9.5%. With this impressive growth, demand for \ntransportation grew quickly. During 1978\u20132004, passenger transport increased by 9% annually \nand  freight  transport  7.6%.  In  2004,  road  traffic  accounted  for  53.7%  of  total  passenger-\nkilometers  (km)  followed  by  railways  (35%),  civil  aviation  (10.9%),  and  coastal  and  inland \nwaterways  (0.4%).  The  modal  split  for  freight  ton-km  was  58.4%  for  coastal  and  inland \nwaterways, 28.9% for railways, 11.4% for roads, 1.2% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n3.  The railway is the primary mode of transport for long distance and bulk transport. At the \nend of 2004, the PRC\u2019s railway system of 74,400 route-kms comprised 61,000 km of national \nrailways and 13,400 km of joint venture and local railways. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) \noperates the state-owned national railway as an integrated system. The joint venture and local \nrailways,  comprising  regional  lines  within  provincial  boundaries,  are  constructed  under  the \nsponsorship  of  provincial  governments  and/or  MOR  to  serve  local  needs  and  provide \ninterconnection to the national railway network. Despite its large size, the railway network does \nnot provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s population and land area.1  \n \n4.  PRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and second highest \npassenger  transport  density  after  Japan.  Locomotive  turnover  is  the  highest  in  the  world. \nBetween 1978 and 2004, railway freight increased from 535 billion ton-km to 1,929 billion ton-\nkm, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 5.1%. Passenger traffic grew at 6.6% annually, \nincreasing from 109 billion to 511 billion passenger-km. The average railway journey increased \nfrom 134 km in 1978 to 484 km in 2004, compared with the average journey per passenger on \nroads, which grew from 35 to 54 km over the same period. Despite such growth rates, railway \ncapacity has lagged demand due to system constraints. Given the railway\u2019s important role for \nproviding economic transportation, these constraints, if not removed, will continue to be among \nthe  major  constraints  to  efficient  economic  growth.  The  Government\u2019s  aggressive  plan  to \nimprove railways includes network expansion and construction in underserved areas. \n   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Government Strategy  \n5.  The Government's policy on railway development focuses on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint venture local railways to \npromote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety of the \nexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation, (iv) reducing operating subsidies through appropriate pricing and commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \n                                                 \n1 The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one third that of India and one tenth that of Japan. \n ", "2   \naccountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related \nservices (Appendix 2).  \n \n6.  The  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. The plan envisages (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide \naccess to unserved areas with the network length reaching a total of 75,000 route-km; (ii) \nproviding 3,000 km of double lines and electrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity; \nand (iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 km, with the total length of such lines reaching \n15,000  km.  A  total  investment  of  CNY350  billion,  including  CNY270  billion  for  capital \nconstruction and CNY80 billion for rolling stock is planned. During 2003\u20132007, the investments \nfor capital construction are expected to reach CNY450 billion (Appendix 3). \n \n7.  In 2004, the State Council approved the Railway Development Plan, which seeks to \nexpand the railway network from the present 74,400 km to 85,000 km by 2010, and 100,000 km \nby 2020; and identifies the need for separate passenger- and freight-dedicated lines on busy \ntrunk routes. The route network length of the passenger-dedicated network will reach 5,000 km \nby 2010 and 12,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed to enhance mobility is a major goal: by \n2020 train speed will be increased to over 200 km per hour on the trunk network from the \npresent 120 km per hour. Priority will be given to developing railways in unserved areas, and \nregions that lack transport and remain less developed. The route network length will increase by \n16,000 km in the western region of the PRC to reach network length of 40,000 km by 2020. \n \n2.  Asian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n8.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for the railway sector focuses on helping \n(i) expand the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved, less-developed areas; (ii) \nmodernize and increase capacity to improve efficiency on key routes of the national railway \nsystem; (iii) commercialize railway operations to sustain efficient operations; and (iv) increase \nrailway competitiveness in transport sector through restructuring and reform. ADB has focused \non the development of railways in poor, less-developed inland provinces to promote sustainable \neconomic growth and reduce poverty.2 ADB has provided 12 loans totaling about $2.2 billion to \nfinance  the  construction  of  about  1,921  km  of  eight  provincial  railways  operated  by  joint \nventures with MOR, and 4,138 km of new railway lines under the four national railway projects \n(Appendix  4).  The  Project,  designed  to  promote  economic  growth  by  providing  railway \ntransportation in unserved, less-developed, and poor areas of Henan and Shaanxi provinces, is \nconsistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and the proposed ADB strategy. \n \n3.  Policy Dialogue  \n9.  Policy dialogue has been a feature of ADB assistance to the railway sector and has \neffectively complemented the lending operations. Since 1989, 10 technical assistance (TA) \ninitiatives totaling $4.6 million have been provided for institutional development of local railways, \ntariff  and  organizational  studies  for  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and \nbusiness operations, marketing and business development, human resource development, and \nimprovement  of  financial  management  and  accounting  systems  (Appendix  4).  ADB  policy \ndialogue  with  MOR  focuses  on  (i)  poverty  reduction  as  the  overarching  objective  of  ADB \noperations, (ii) full compliance with ADB safeguard policies, (iii) sector reforms, (iv) marketing \nand business development, (v) private sector participation and nongovernmental financing, and \n(vi) regional cooperation. The Railway Development Plan defines the major goals for the PRC \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty \nReduction. Manila. The findings conclude that completed railway projects supported general economic growth in \nthe region, as well as led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway stations. \n ", "  3 \nrailways to 2020, and is in broad agreement with the ADB strategic agenda. MOR\u2019s proposed \nreform agenda for this plan seeks to (i) study and learn from the best international practices \ngained worldwide, (ii) separate core operations from noncore transportation businesses, (iii) \nrationalize and reduce staff, (iv) reform the railway investment and financing system, and (v) \nestablish specialized transportation companies.  \n \n10.  MOR  has  adopted  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  using  a  new \nmanagement concept\u2014the asset operating liability system, MOR entered into management \ncontracts with railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The contracts \nhelped  improve  operational  and  financial  performance;  subsequently  this  approach  was \nextended to all 15 railway administrations. Separation of core and noncore businesses is a key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation business was reduced from 1.89 million in 1997 to 1.55 million in 2004. In the \nnoncore  transportation business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested. To provide jobs for redundant staff, by the end of 2004 MOR had set up 5,800 \ndiversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business), employing more than \n416,000 staff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR \ninitiated a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. In \n2004, MOR completed the transfer of 826 educational institutes and 208 hospitals to local \ngovernments.  One  hundred  branch  lines  comprising  7,800  km  were  separated  to  improve \nproductivity  and  reduce  operating  losses  (The  reform  agenda  matrix  is  in  Appendix  5, \nSupplementary Appendix A includes a chronology of railway reforms). \n \na.  Poverty Reduction \n11.  The strategic purpose of ADB involvement in the railway sector is to create conditions for \nsustainable  economic  growth  to  help  improve  living  standards.  The  Project,  located  in  an \nunserved area, has the potential for economic growth once improved, cost-effective transport \naccess is provided. Identifying ways to enhance the poverty reduction impact has been an \nintegral part of project planning and design. Specific features include (i) providing employment \nduring construction and operation of the ZXR on a preferential basis to poor workers including \nwomen;3 (ii)  utilizing  locally  produced  materials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and \neconomy  (e.g.,  sand,  stone,  cement);  (iii)  adding  provisions  for  railway  station  area \ndevelopment;  (iv)  providing  station  access  roads  and  construction  access  roads;  and  (v) \nsupporting  poverty  reduction  programs  of  local  governments. 4  The  Project  will  finance \nconstruction  access  roads  to  be  handed  over  to  the  local  government  at  the  end  of  the \nconstruction. The local governments also have a 5-year plan to improve the road network and \ntransport services in the project area concurrently with the Project. These roads will reach all of \nthe  province-designated  poverty  villages.  The  Project  and  the  local  road  development  will \nincrease the welfare gains for the poor including women and help spread project benefits to the \npoverty villages. \n \n                                                 \n3  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the proportion of the poor in unskilled labor was 41% on average and 64% \nduring peak construction.

Sector Reforms \n12.  ADB is supporting institutional reform of the railway sector to separate the Government \nand enterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing the competitiveness of \nthe railways. ADB has actively pursued separation of core transport business from the noncore \ntransport business, segmentation of passenger and freight services, and strengthening of the \nrecently corporatized specialized transportation companies. Setting up of passenger-dedicated \ncorridors with a separate institutional structure is a key ADB intervention. As part of ADB policy \ndialogue with MOR, three large companies handling containers, special goods, and express \nparcel  have  been  set  up. 5 Rationalization  of  staff  and  reduction  of  transportation  and \nnontransportation staff is also being pursued. On 18 March 2005, MOR undertook a major \nrestructuring exercise and abolished 41 subrailway administration bureaus, thereby reducing \none tier of railway management. The number of railway administrations has increased from 15 \nto 18. This will reduce staff, rationalize operations, improve productivity, and enhance efficiency. \nADB will continue supporting operational reforms, including emphasizing railway safety and the \nintroduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology,  upgrading  speeds,  and  introducing  dedicated \npassenger  and  freight  lines,  modern  dispatch  control  system,  and  high  quality  information \nsystems on the PRC railway network. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization \nhas intensified competition among different modes of transport and the structure of transport \ndemand is likely to change.6 ADB is providing an advisory TA for policy reform support.7 During \nproject processing, coordination was maintained with the World Bank and a common approach \nto reforms and assistance developed. This will be continued during project implementation. \n \nc.  Marketing and Business Development  \n13.  As the PRC progresses to a market-driven economy, railways will need to compete on \nthe basis of price and service quality for demand-based transportation services. New marketing \nand business development initiatives are needed for freight and passenger services to be \ncompetitive. In past projects, ADB has supported project-specific studies to create marketing \nand business development opportunities, including skills and knowledge for market\u2013oriented \noperation and awareness of profitable operations. The Project will continue these initiatives \nthrough a capacity development program for the Project Company. \n \nd.  Private Sector Participation  \n14.  ADB policy dialogue encourages private sector participation in the railway sector for the \nprovision of services, construction, tourism, container, and luggage-related businesses. The \nsetting up of a corporate entity to construct, operate, and manage the Project is a significant \nstep. Discussion is under way to explore the possibility of future listing of the proposed company \non the stock market.8 A leading group has been established and is looking at the possibility of \ndiversified financing sources, including from the private sector. Establishing large container \nterminals  at  Zhengzhou  and  Xi\u2019an  will  facilitate  participation  of  shipping  lines  and  freight \n                                                 \n5  These companies are China Railway Container Transport Company, China Railway Express Parcel Company, and \nChina Railway Special Goods Company. The startup process is ongoing. ADB and MOR have agreed on the \nseparation of container businesses as part of the ADB-financed Yichang\u2013Wanzhou Railway Project.

Under the Project, MOR will encourage \nthe development of station facilities, local tourism, and real estate. Activities, such as consulting \nservices  for  construction  supervision,  testing,  construction  contracts,  track  maintenance, \ncommercial activities, loading and unloading, and other logistical facilities, will be outsourced to \nenhance opportunities for private sector participation. \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n15.  Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC \nshows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of executing agencies for \nproject implementation (Appendix 6). The speed of implementation has generally exceeded \nexpectations  at  appraisal,  and  agencies  have  generally  complied  with  loan  covenants. \nResettlement and environmental management were carried out satisfactorily. Audit covenants \nwere complied with in a timely manner, and the audited financial statements were generally \nacceptable.  Of  the  12  ADB-supported  railway  projects,  5  are  complete,9 3  have  started \ncommercial operations,10 and 4 are under implementation.11  \n \n16.  The key lessons from the completed railway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that \nthe executing agency established for project processing, implementation and operation has \nadequate capacity; (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a \nnetwork basis, and the impact on project viability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and \nother transportation modes that may compete with the project facilities; and (iv) finance railway \nprojects with appropriately determined debt-equity ratios.  \n \n17.  Previous  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  the \nprojects' influence areas. The main impacts are (i) new railway lines in less-developed regions \nstimulated economic development resulting in higher growth rates of gross domestic product \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1989.

The \nlessons learned and experience gained are incorporated in the current project design.  \n \n5.  Rationale \n18.  The project rationale reflects (i) network development; (ii) capacity enhancement; (iii) \nsupport for the PRC Railway Development Plan and the western region development strategy; \nand (iv) promotion of pro-poor economic growth along the rail line and in the region, thereby \nreducing poverty. The project area is largely mountainous with abundant natural reserves of \ncoal, zinc, and other nonferrous materials; and a large manufacturing industry and tourist sites. \nIn spite of abundant natural resources, many are poor and the economic growth necessary to \nreduce rural poverty has failed to develop because of inadequate transport services and high \ncosts.  Local  governments  and  people  living  in  the  project  area  see  the  railway  as  a  key \ninvestment for addressing this problem. \n \n19.  The Project is the first of eight passenger-dedicated corridors to be developed by 2020. \nThe proposed alignment for the ZXR is 50 km shorter than the existing Longhai railway line, \n                                                 \n12 In the project area of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway (footnote 9), the gross domestic product of 10 counties in Jiangxi \nprovince increased from CNY4.9 billion in 1993 to CNY15.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 25.5% compared \nwith 10.2% for the province as a whole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased from CNY802 in 1993 \nto CNY2,222 in 1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the Project). \n13 During the first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway (footnote 10), a total of about 7.5 million \nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55% were provided to local \npoor people thereby raising them above the poverty line. \n14 The financial revenue of 10 poverty counties in Jiangxi province that are traversed by the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway \n(footnote 9) increased from CNY0.5 billion in 1993 to CNY1.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 22.7% \ncompared with 12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway. \n15 The Jing\u2013Jiu Railway facilitated the setting up of many resource- and agriculture-based industries in Xingfeng \ncounty of Jiangxi province\u2014from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project completion. The number of businesses grew \nfrom 8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons employed in these increased from 18,484 in \n1992 to 52,153 in 1998; an annual increase of 23%. In the same county, the number of people living below the \npoverty line was reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a decline of 62%. \n16 Beneficial income and social impacts, particularly on women, were noted in the influence areas of the Yaogu\u2013\nMaoming Railway (footnote 9) and Guang\u2013Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 9). \n ", "  7 \nwhich has the highest transport density in PRC railways and is fully saturated. Traversing \nHenan  and  Shaanxi,  the  proposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  the  Beijing\u2013Guangzhou, \nShanghai\u2013Xuzhou, and Beijing\u2013Wuhan main lines on the east and Xi\u2019an\u2013Baoji\u2013Lanzhou, Xi\u2019an\u2013\nBaoji\u2013Chengdu, Xi\u2019an\u2013Ankang, and Xi\u2019an\u2013Yan\u2019an17 main lines on the west. The proposed line \nextends eastward to Shangqiu and Xuzhou, connecting with Jing\u2013Jiu18 and Jing\u2013Hu routes; and \nwestward to Baoji and Lanzhou, connecting with the Jing\u2013Lan routes and Lan\u2013Xin line. This is \nthe main east-west corridor linking Beijing, Shanghai, Lianyungang, and other major cities and \nports in the east, to Xi\u2019an, Baoji, Lanzhou, Urumqi, Chengdu, and Chongqing, in the west; the \ncurrent capacity on the existing Longhai line is fully used. Presently both freight and passenger \nare transported on the same line. This practice limits speeds and restricts traffic flow. When \ncompleted, the Project will release capacity on the existing Longhai line, and support growth of \nfreight and container traffic. The Project will also help promote regional cooperation, as this is \nthe main east-west corridor linking the PRC to Central Asia and Europe. \n \n20.  The Project and associated developments are expected to stimulate tourism and related \nindustries, and industrial and natural resources development; increase mobility and flow of \ninformation  exchanges;  generate  employment;  increase  living  standards;  and  help  reduce \npoverty.  The  Project  is  a  part  of  the  Government's  program  to  integrate  development  of \ntransportation  facilities,  upgrade  highways,  and  construct  links  and  access  roads  to  the \nhinterland. Other infrastructure, such as water supply and investment to improve education and \nhealth care facilities are also planned. The railway will play an important role in facilitating and \nintegrating this poor and underdeveloped region.  \n \n21.  The Project will be a joint venture railway owned and operated by MOR and the Henan \nand Shaanxi provincial governments (HPG and SPG). Joint venture railways, which account for \n8,500 km (2004) of the PRC system, have substantial managerial and financial autonomy, \nincluding the freedom to set tariffs, which are several times higher than those of the national \nnetwork. Freight and passenger traffic on joint venture railways has grown faster than on the \nnational railways. Between 1996 and 2004, passenger traffic grew from 2.2 billon passenger-km \nto 19.6 billion (32%), and freight from 12.3 billion ton-kilometers to 91.4 billion (28.5%) annually \nas compared with an annual growth rate of 6.8% for passengers and 4.9% for freight on the \nnational railway network. Joint venture railways are more efficient, employing only 5\u20138 people \nper km compared with about 25 people per km for the national railways. The Project Company \nwill employ 7.24 people per km. \n \n22.  The Project is a key intervention in the railway sector. It introduces the concept of \nseparate  corridors  for  passenger  and  freight  for  high-density  routes,  with  many  technical, \noperational,  safety,  economic,  and  financial benefits.  Because  it  is a  pilot  project,  ADB  is \nassisting  in  developing  the  institutional,  marketing,  business  development,  and  technical \nstandards for such initiatives. MOR has agreed that a corporate entity will be set up to construct, \noperate, and manage the Project, and that it will help enhance financial viability and private \nsector participation. The tariffs agreed are affordable and financially viable. The Project will \nbring in new technology and pursue operational reforms, including the introduction of safe and \nreliable technology, increase of speeds, and introduction of modern dispatch control systems \nand high quality information systems on the railway network. When complete, the Project will \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1997.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  By removing a transport constraint to sustainable economic growth, the Project will help \nincrease standards of living and reduce poverty in the project area. This will be achieved by \nproviding efficient, affordable railway transportation in unserved, less-developed areas to create \nconditions necessary for developing local resources and generating employment and income-\nenhancing opportunities. \n \nB.  Outputs \n24.  The Project comprises nine components: (i) construction of 459 km of double-track, \nelectrified,  standard  gauge  class  I  passenger-dedicated  railway  between  Zhengzhou  and \nXi\u2019an;19 (ii) construction of 9 new railway stations complete with facilities; (iii) safety initiatives, \nincluding  provision  of  modern  technology  and  equipment  for  enhancing  safety;  (iv)  e-\ngovernance and operating dispatch information system; (v) provision of training on the use and \nmaintenance of modern equipment; (vi) land acquisition and resettlement; (vii) environmental \nprotection  and  mitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects;  (viii)  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and marketing and business development; \nand  (ix)  strengthening  of  institutional  capabilities.  The  key  inputs  needed  for  project \nimplementation include civil works, equipment, consultants, and MOR and the Project Company \nstaff.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n25.  Subregional  Context. The proposed railway link is the main east-west railway link \nproviding land access to Europe through Kazakhstan. The Project will promote railway and \nmultimodal transport of goods and people in the region and thus support regional cooperation. \nMOR will construct two extra-large container terminals to promote regional traffic. \n \n26.  Safety. ADB policy dialogue has emphasized the need for operational reforms for the \nrail  network,  including  enhancing  safety  by  introducing  safe  and  reliable  technology; \nmodernizing maintenance systems; and monitoring safety performance. A project component \n($49.58 million equivalent, of which $20.5 million will be financed by the ADB loan) will promote \nand enhance railway safety. It will finance the procurement of operation and maintenance \nequipment to enhance safety and build capacity, including staff training. \n \n27.  E-Governance and the Operating Dispatch Information System. Part of ADB policy \ndialogue emphasized introducing modern management systems and high-quality information \nsystems for the PRC railway network. A project component ($79 million equivalent, of which \n$32.61 million will be financed by the ADB loan) will introduce a modern operating dispatch \ninformation  system,  linking  the  project  train  and  national  train  reservation  systems,  and \nintroducing a simulation system to monitor and analyze train performance.  \n \n28.  Logistic Center. MOR has agreed to construct two extra-large container terminals at \nZhengzhou and Xi-an to attract high-value traffic on the railways; promote intermodal traffic; and \nencourage private sector shippers and freight forwarders to use the facility for export and import \n                                                 \n19 Supplementary Appendix B describes characteristics of the ZXR. \n ", "  9 \nof cargo to other parts of the PRC, ports in the east, and Central Asia and Europe in the west. \nThese will be financed by MOR and completed by 2009. \n \n29.  Tourism. Both Henan and Shaanxi are important tourist destinations and the Project will \nsupport tourism development. In 5 key tourist station areas along the project railway, Luoyang, \nHubin, Tongguan, and Lintong districts, 13.7 million people visited as tourists in 2003 providing \nrevenue of CNY 381 million. The local government support to the communities including the \npoor  to  promote  tourism  business  has  been  successful,  including  village  home  stays  and \nhandicrafts. The provincial and the local governments agreed to further increase such support \nby re-allocating some of the increased tax revenue from the Project.    \n \n30.  Private Sector. Activities like consulting services for construction supervision, testing, \nconstruction contracts, and track maintenance is expected to be outsourced. The Project will \nencourage private sector initiatives like onboard train services, including catering, cleaning, and \nloading and unloading at railway stations. Station space will be developed and rented out by \nopen competition; and private sidings, hotels, restaurants, and other logistic facilities will be \nencouraged in the vicinity of stations. \n \n31.  Reforms. ADB has engaged MOR in dialogue aimed at enhancing policy reform during \nproject processing; this will be continued. The separation of passenger and freight businesses is \na major step, and this is the first project to develop the institutional and technical standards for \nsuch initiatives. Setting up a corporate entity to construct, operate, and manage the Project is \nalso a significant step. Discussion is under way to explore the possibility of future listing of the \nproposed company on the stock market. A project leading group has been established and is \nexploring the possibility of diversified financing sources, including from the private sector. The \nProject  proposes  specific  measures  to  outsource  some  activities  handled  by  railways  and \ninvolve the private sector. MOR will continue the process of separating the national core and \nnoncore activities and rationalizing staff. The Project will introduce new technology, emphasize \nsafety, and build capacity for MOR and the joint venture railways. \n \n32.  Social Development Plan. The Project will facilitate economic development, which will \nbenefit  the  largely  poor  population,  particularly  women  and  the  vulnerable.  The  social \ndevelopment action plan (SDAP) will enhance project benefits; and ensure adverse impacts are \navoided or mitigated; and economic development benefits the poor, women, ethnic minorities, \nand the vulnerable in an equitable and sustainable manner. \n \n33.  Stakeholder  Consultation  and  Participation.  Extensive  consultations  including \nsurveys  involved  about  10,000  people,  such  as  local  villagers,  tourists,  business  persons, \ntransport  users,  and  local  governments  (Appendix  7).  This  helped  to  (i) understand  public \nopinion  about  the  proposed  railway;  (ii) conduct  the  environmental,  economic,  and  social \nassessments; (iii) plan resettlement; and (iv) identify the role of various stakeholders. Leading \ngroups have been formed in the prefectures with participation from the relevant government \nagencies, including poverty reduction offices; All-China Women\u2019s Federation; and health, civil \naffairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus. The local governments assured that the consultation process \nwill be continued to finalize the design and formulate appropriate land compensation, relocation, \nand rehabilitation measures. \n \n34.  Railway Station Area Development. The Project includes 11 railway stations, which \nwill be connected to villages, townships, and counties by roads and other transport networks. \nThe local government assured that the railway stations and surrounding areas will be developed \nwith local communities to promote local businesses, income-generating activities, and other \nopportunities that can benefit all communities, especially the remote poor and women. \n \n ", "10   \n35.  Local  Employment  for  Railway  Construction  and  Maintenance.  About  353,000 \nperson-years of work will be created per year during construction. Of this, about 60% will be for \nunskilled laborers, of which 50% or more will be targeted to poor, resettlement-affected people; \nwomen; ethnic minorities; and other vulnerable people. The use of locally produced materials for \nrailway construction will generate additional employment. The poverty reduction offices and \nwomen\u2019s federations will tailor their programs to ensure sustained gains from employment and \nincome-generating activities resulting from the railway project, by providing training and capacity \nbuilding. People who have gained short-term income during construction will be consulted and \ntrained to utilize the short-term income for a sustainable livelihood. This will include sending the \npoor to advanced vocational schools. The increased tax revenue including that from the civil \nworks contractors will help augment these programs. \n \n36.  Complementary  Development  Initiatives. To enhance development impacts in the \nproject area, the Henan and Shaanxi provincial and local governments will provide road access, \nelectricity, and telephone to all the poverty villages along the alignment. Road access will be \nprovided to 187 villages, electricity supply to 24 villages, and telephone connections to 163 \nvillages by 2009. The local governments will also reallocate part of the tax revenue obtained \nfrom the civil works contractors to the relevant agencies to undertake development programs in \nthe project area. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n37.  The  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  is  estimated  at \n$4,131.93 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange costs of $1,364.61 million (33%) and \nlocal currency costs of $2,767.32 million equivalent (67%) (Table 1), details are in Appendix 8. \nThe cost estimates are based on quantities derived from preliminary engineering designs and \nunit  rates  reflecting  market  prices  for  goods  and  materials,  and  include  the  costs  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation and monitoring. \n \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total  \nItem  Exchange Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n38.  The Government has requested a loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum, \nconversion options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  regulations  and \nconversion guidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. \nThe front-end fee will be waived. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n39.  MOR will finance the remaining foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost will be \nfinanced by MOR, HPG, SPG, and cofinancing through a loan from the China Development \nBank, which has appraised the Project and provided a commitment letter to MOR. The China \nDevelopment Bank loan is repayable over 20 years, including a grace period of 6 years, and at \na lending rate currently at 5.5% per annum. HPG and SPG will finance the land acquisition and \nresettlement costs; this will be their equity contribution. MOR, HPG, and SPG have made \nbudgetary provisions for the counterpart funds. A summary of the financing plan is in Table 2 \nand the details are in Appendix 8. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total  \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank   400.00  0.00  400.00  9.68 \nChina Development Bank   0.00  1,667.27  1,667.27  40.35 \nMOR, HPG, SPG  964.61  1,110.05  2,064.66  49.97 \n     Total  1,364.61  2,767.32  4,131.93  100.00 \nHPG = Henan provincial government, MOR = Ministry of Railways, SPG = Shaanxi provincial government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n40.  MOR will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall project implementation. The \nForeign  Capital  and  Technical  Import  Center,  under  MOR,  will  coordinate  the  project \nmanagement office's tasks and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, and reporting vis-\n\u00e0-vis ADB. MOR is in the process of setting up a project company (the Project Company), a \nlimited liability company under the PRC Company Law, which will be the project Implementing \nAgency. The Project Company will manage and operate the project railway after completion of \nthe construction; and develop and implement adequate and transparent business development \nmechanisms, and accounting and reporting systems. A project leading group headed by a \ndirector general and assisted by an adequate number of suitably qualified professional staff has \nbeen established. It is undertaking the preparatory work of setting up the Project Company and \nis setting up the on-site construction management offices along the project route. The staff are \nexperienced in railway engineering, financial, and administrative matters, and in implementing \nprojects financed by international financial institutions. This leading group will be merged with \nthe  Project  Company  once  it  is  established.  To  develop  the  Project  Company\u2019s  project \n ", "12   \nmanagement,  business  development,  and  marketing  capacity,  further  assistance  will  be \nprovided by the project-financed consulting services. The setting up of the Project Company is a \ncondition for disbursement. The financial assessment questionnaire indicates that the Project \nwill  have  an  adequate  financial  management  system  in  place  (details  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C).  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n41.  The Project will be implemented over about 6 years from August 2005 to December \n2011. Land acquisition will start in September 2005, and the civil works in October 2005 with \ncompletion in about 5 years. The trial operations will start in October 2010 for 1 year before \ncommercial operations begin (Appendix 9).  \n \n3.  Procurement \n42.  All ADB financed procurement will follow ADB Guidelines for Procurement. ADB will \nfinance procurement of materials and equipment. The civil works will be procured under local \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Equipment will be procured under international competitive \nbidding or international shopping or direct purchase (Appendix 10). Contracts valued in excess \nof $1,000,000 for materials and equipments will be procured through international competitive \nbidding. Any supply contracts not exceeding $1,000,000 will be procured through international \nshopping and contracts not exceeding $100,000 will be procured through direct purchase. MOR \nwill select tendering companies on a competitive basis to handle the international bidding. The \nrelevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all documents and contracts \nduring bidding for, and implementation, of the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n43.  The  Government  will  engage  and  finance  about  28,000  person-months  of  qualified \ninternational and domestic consultants for (i) detailed project design; (ii) preparation of technical \nspecifications;  (iii)  construction  supervision;  (iv)  construction  quality  assurance;  (v) \nenvironmental supervision and management; (vi) monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement \nplan; and (vii) socioeconomic impact assessment, evaluation of poverty reduction, and project \nperformance monitoring. \n \n44.  The ADB loan will be used to finance 20 person-months of international consulting \nservices to (i) strengthen institutional, marketing, and business development functions of the \nProject  Company;  and  (ii)  research  and  strengthen  the  development,  operation,  and \nmanagement of the passenger-dedicated railway systems in the PRC. Terms of reference for \nthe international consultants, to be recruited using the quality- and cost-based method and \nsimplified technical proposal, in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, are \ngiven in Appendix 11. The provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all \ninvitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n45.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with the ADB \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. Since most of the payments will be made for large contracts well \nabove $200,000, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw the loan \nfunds.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $200,000. \n \n ", "  13 \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  The Project Company will maintain separate accounts for the Project and have such \naccounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The Project Company, through MOR, will submit to \nADB, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of such audited project \naccounts  and  financial  statements  and  auditor's  reports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of  such \nfinancial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal \ncontrol systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions; (ii) an \nassessment of compliance with loan covenants and ADB requirements for project management; \nand (iii) an opinion on the use of the statement of expenditure procedure. The Project Company \nwill also submit its audited financial statements covering income statements, balance sheets, \nand  cash-flow  statements  during  construction  and  in  the  first  three  years  of  commercial \noperations of the project railway within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. To ensure \nthat the effective internal control system and checks and balances mechanism are put in place, \nThe Project Company will establish an internal control unit within the company. The unit will \nindependently test financial transactions to ensure the safe custody of the project-financed \nassets and report directly to the Project Company's board of directors. \n \n47.  The Project Company will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of \nproject implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports through MOR. Within 3 months \nof completion, MOR will submit a project completion report to ADB.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n48.  MOR agreed to a set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its \nimpacts, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. The indicators, to be reviewed at the start of project \nimplementation, include (i) economic development and socioeconomic indicators, (ii) transport \ncosts  and  time  for  passenger  services,  (iii)  transport  services  and  transport  charges,  (iv) \naccident rates, (v) financial sustainability, (vi) county/village incomes, (vii) access to social \nservices, and (viii) jobs created in construction and maintenance. At the beginning of project \nimplementation, MOR and the Project Company will establish baseline and target values for the \nindicators. The indicators will be measured at project inception, completion, and 3 years later; \nand compared with the baseline. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender \n(Appendix 12). MOR will recruit qualified consultants for monitoring and evaluation to help \nestablish the monitoring and evaluation system, and train the Project Company staff in its use. \nThe main sources of data include (i) secondary data from government sources, (ii) household \nsocioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rapid appraisal. MOR will submit a report \nsummarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later to ADB. \n  \n8.  Project Review \n49.  In 2008, ADB, MOR, and the Project Company will carry out a midterm review of the \nProject, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, \npoverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have \nan impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. The review will examine \nprogress in sector reforms, policy development, resettlement, environment, poverty impact, and \ncompliance with assurances in the loan agreement. \n \n ", "14   \n  9.  Anticorruption Measures \n50.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added \nto ADB Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the \nneed for bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of \nethics in the procurement and execution of ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud \nand corruption are discovered.  \n \n51.  Based on MOR\u2019s experience in fighting corruption, the following actions will be taken to \nprevent corruption: (i) a supervisory body is established for prevention of undue interference in \nbusiness practices and adequate resources are made available for its effective operation, and \n(ii) a leading group of officials from the Discipline Unit and Supervision Department of the MOR \nis located in offices involved in the bidding, construction and other operational activities under \nthe Project. The Borrower shall also cause MOR and the Project Company to initiate liaison \nmeetings with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, on a needed basis, where warnings about or information \non corrupt practices can be discussed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n52.  The project benefits and impacts were assessed along with potential risks associated \nwith the Project. The combined benefits and impacts will outweigh the costs, and net benefits \nwill accrue to the project area. \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n53.  The traffic forecast was based on forecasts prepared by the Fourth Survey and Design \nInstitute  (FSDI),  by  considering  expected  economic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism \ndevelopment  potential,  local  government  development  plans,  market  surveys,  and  the \nassessment of TA consultants and the ADB Mission. The passenger volume on the ZXR is \nforecast to grow from 15,652 million passenger-km in 2011 to 50,372 million passenger-km in \n2031, with an average growth rate of 6%. As a result of the released capacity on the Longhai \nline with project completion, the freight traffic on the ZXR corridor is forecast to increase from \nabout 16,140 million ton-km in 2011 to 49,024 million ton-km in 2031, with an annual growth \nrate of 5.7% based on similar factors. The projected volumes can be accommodated by the \nZXR and justify project construction (Appendix 13). \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n54.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project situations. The ZXR will reduce the cost of transport to and from the poor north \nand northwestern part of Henan and Shaanxi. Economic costs include costs for construction, \noperation, and maintenance, and value of agricultural production from land lost permanently. \nEconomic benefits include (i) operating cost savings for freight and passenger traffic, (ii) time \nsaving in diverted passenger traffic from buses, (iii) net economic value added of generated \ncommodity production, (v) generated passenger benefits, and (vi) tourism benefits. The project \nEIRR is 17.4%, indicating the Project is economically viable (Appendix 13). Sensitivity analysis \nconfirms the robustness of the Project's economic viability. Changes in the key variables, such \nas a 20% reduction in benefits, do not significantly impact economic viability. The capital cost \nwould have to increase by 33% over those estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of \n12%.  The  freight  and  passenger  benefits  would  have  to  decrease  by  30%  and  323% \nrespectively. Given experience in the PRC railway sector, variations of such magnitude are \n ", "  15 \nunlikely. Project risks were quantified using the statistical method, i.e., considering the possible \nvalue for key variables and the probability with which they may occur. The result shows that the \nEIRR will exceed 12% with 97% probability. Distribution analysis, undertaken by determining the \nproject effects for various beneficiaries, indicates that a large portion of net benefits will accrue \nto project users. \n \nC.  Financial Benefits  \n55.  Financial  projections  prepared  for  the  Project  Company,  in  accordance  with  ADB \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects, assessed the \nfinancial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  railway  (Appendix 14).  The  projected  financial \nstatements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover operation and maintenance \ncosts, income taxes, and debt service; and provide a reasonable rate of return. The financial \nevaluation was undertaken in real terms using constant 2005 prices. The project cost estimates \nand financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the \nprojected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental costs \nand benefits were derived under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate \nof return, computed on an after-tax basis, is 7%. This compares favorably with the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  3%.  The  Project  is  both \nfinancially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the financial internal \nrate of return for the Project is robust under most conditions (Appendix 14). \n \n56.  Consolidated financial statements for MOR have been prepared based on past audited \nfinancial statements; Based on the consultant\u2019s estimates, MOR\u2019s financial performance is \nprojected to be sound and sustainable over the operating period (Supplementary Appendix D). \nFinancial ratios were discussed and covenanted. \n \nD.  Environmental Impact and Assessment \n57.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  A.  The  FSDI,  Environmental \nEngineering  Division  prepared  an  EIA,  which  was  approved  by  the  State  Environmental \nProtection Agency on 21 June 2005. MOR endorsed the summary EIA, which was circulated to \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors and uploaded on the ADB website on 29 April 2005 (Supplementary \nAppendix E).  \n \n58.  Potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  include  (i)  noise  and  vibration  impacts  on \nadjacent residents; (ii) soil erosion from cut and fill activities; (iii) disturbance of historical, \ncultural, and archaeological sites; (iv) impact on surface water quality of adjacent waterways; \nand (v) public health and safety. \n  \n59.  The  EIA  concluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  successfully \nmitigated through the use of best practices and appropriate technologies. Implementation of the \nenvironmental management, mitigation, and monitoring programs included in the EIA will ensure \ncompliance with ADB and Government environmental guidelines and procedures. Internal and \nexternal monitoring and audits will be conducted to ensure that standards and regulations are \nfollowed. An independent monitoring agency will be hired to carry out external monitoring and \nevaluation work during implementation. \n \nE.  Impact on Poverty  \n60.  The  railway  passes  through  two  provinces  (Henan  and  Shaanxi);  five  prefectures \n(Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Sanmenxia, Weinan, and Xi\u2019an) 19 counties, 6 of which are designated \n ", "16   \nnational or provincial poverty counties; and 725 designated poverty villages with about 1.3 \nmillion poor residents. The Project will benefit about 9.3 million people in the project area\u2014\nabout 90.2% are rural (17 counties) and 15.0% are poor with a net income per capita of less \nthan CNY900 in 2004. In the urban area (2 counties), 5.8% are poor with per capita income less \nthan that of minimum living standards. Of the total population, 14.0% are poor. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16. \n \n61.  Poverty in the area is caused by (i) geographical remoteness and isolation, limited road \naccess, high transport costs, and limited access to market and information; (ii) adverse weather \nconditions and limited natural resources (e.g., cold weather, water scarcity, and limited arable \nland); (iii) lack of knowledge and technical skills in cropping and animal husbandry; (iv) limited \naccess to credit and training for off-farm activities; (v) limited off-farm employment opportunities; \n(vi) poor social infrastructure, and lack of access to good health care facilities; and (vii) high cost \nof middle and higher education. \n \n62.  About 353,000 person-years of work will be created during railway construction, 60% will \nbe unskilled work. Half of the unskilled work will be targeted for the poor, totaling 105,920 \nperson-years at total wages of CNY1,037 million or CNY9,790 per person-year. Priority will be \ngiven to women, people affected by resettlement, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable people. \nIn addition, during construction, 6,249 person-years of local jobs will be created in the provision \nof construction material with total wages of CNY61.4 million, of which 1,875 person-years will be \nfor the poor, with total wages of CNY18.4 million or annual average wage of CNY9,828 per \ncapita. When the operation of the new railway starts, approximately 2,988 additional jobs will be \ncreated with total wages of CNY53.7 million annually or CNY1,344.5 million during the 25-year \noperation period. The estimated construction tax revenue from the Project to counties in the \nproject  area  is  CNY714  million.  Local  governments  are  responsible  for  provision  of  social \nservices  and  poverty  reduction  funds  for  county  poverty  reduction  planning.  The  local \ngovernments agreed to allocate part of this added revenue for a range of poverty reduction and \nsocial activities, including mitigation of negative impacts of HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and STIs (sexually transmitted infections), human \ntrafficking, and environment, with special attention to resettlement-affected groups, women, \nethnic groups, and other vulnerable people. This includes a program of income sustainability for \nthe poor after project implementation, especially those hired for project construction.  \n \n63.  The 11 railway stations, connected to all villages including poverty villages, will create \njobs, and help distribute project benefits. The stations will have sufficient space inside and out \nfor local area development; local governments will support the poor and other vulnerable people \nto sell local produce, handicrafts, and goods. Expecting more efficient freight transport from the \nexisting railway, and business travel on the project railway, many enterprises are planning to \nexpand  their  outputs  and  increase  labor.  As  the  project  area  includes  internationally  and \nnationally well-known tourist areas, additional revenue and employment are expected from \ntourism. In 2003, 4 million domestic tourists used the train to visit tourist sites along the project \nrailway alignment. Annually, over 3.55 million additional tourists are expected to use the project \nrailway, which over 25 years means 88.75 million tourists, with total revenue of CNY2,304 \nmillion. These direct and indirect impacts will provide conditions for poor families to (i) move \naway  from  unsustainable,  mountainous  farmlands;  (ii)  have  better  access  to  markets,  and \nadvanced educational and health facilities, especially for women; and (iii) build a sustainable \nfuture in new centers of economic activity. \n \n ", "  17 \nF.  Resettlement Impact  \n64.  The project railway alignment will cross 170 rural villages and 13 urban neighborhoods \nin 19 counties and urban districts from Zhengzhou to Xi\u2019an. An estimated 1,782 hectares (ha) of \nland  will  be  permanently  acquired,  of  which  about  63%  is  currently  under  cultivation,  8% \norchards, 11% housing plots, 2% forest, 4% grassland, and 12% wasteland. Approximately \n16,147 people will be affected in terms of loss of land, assuming total loss of cultivated land \nbased  on  average  per  capita  landholdings.  The  Project  will  also  temporarily  require  an \nestimated 596 ha. About 1,682,392 square meters (m2) of structures will be affected, of which \n79% are residential structures. Relocation of 29,774 people will be required. The Project will \nalso  require  relocation  of  46,426  m2  of  schools  and  302,087  m2  of  factories  and  other \nenterprises. A total of 36,736 people will be directly affected. Land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts are minimized by aligning the railway away from urban areas, village centers, and other \nfacilities, where possible, based on consultations with communities.  \n \n65.  MOR, in consultation with provincial and local governments, has prepared a resettlement \nplan (Appendix 15, the full plan is in Supplementary Appendix F) based on the preliminary \ndesign  study;  village  surveys  of  all  170  rural  villages,  and  all  13  village-level  urban \nneighborhoods;  2,354  household  surveys;  provincial,  prefecture,  and  local  government \nstatistics;  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected  households. \nAlthough the total amount of land and people affected is large, these impacts are spread thinly \nover a long narrow corridor. Income loss from land acquisition is less severe because this \ncorridor is developing rapidly and at least 70% of net income for  more than  half of rural \nhouseholds comes from nonagricultural employment and small businesses. Special assistance \nwill be provided to vulnerable households that include the poor, widows, disabled, and ethnic \nminorities.  \n \n66.  Local government land administration bureaus, in conjunction with railway construction \nsupport offices, will be responsible for implementing resettlement; many activities will be carried \nout by township officials and village committees. The estimated resettlement cost is $181.4 \nmillion, excluding the costs for enterprise relocation and infrastructure. In December 2004, \nMOR, HPG, and SPG signed agreements whereby local governments will fund 100% of the cost \nof land acquisition and resettlement; this in turn will be an equity contribution to the Project. The \nresettlement budget will be adjusted based on the actual measurement of physical losses and \nmarket prices. Affected people have been informed and consulted about the likely impacts at \nvarious stages. During the preliminary design stage, stakeholders consulted included heads of \naffected  households;  village  leaders  and  representatives;  local  government  agencies  and \ndepartments;  and  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  ethnic  minorities.  Resettlement \ninformation booklets were distributed to affected villages in April 2005, and MOR, HPG, and \nSPG endorsed the resettlement plan.  \n \n67.  MOR and municipal land acquisition and resettlement offices, in collaboration with the \ncounty resettlement offices, will be responsible for internal supervision and monitoring. MOR will \nprepare progress reports and submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis, until resettlement is \ncompleted. MOR will then prepare a resettlement completion report for submission to ADB. In \naddition, an independent monitor will carry out the external monitoring and evaluation, and \nprepare monitoring reports for submission to MOR and ADB every 6 months until completion of \nresettlement activities; thereafter, annual evaluation investigations will be conducted for at least \n2 years and reported to MOR and ADB. \n \n ", "18   \nG.  Ethnic Minorities \n68.   The project area has 52,527 residents from 11 ethnic minority nationalities, representing \n0.65% of the total population of the project area (9.5 million). The main ethnic group (83.7%) is \nHui, who are descendants of Muslim traders that settled in Xi\u2019an and Zhengzhou. About 500 \nmay be affected by land acquisition and resettlement. Investigations reveal the Hui villagers \nwere integrated with the Han and shared the same socioeconomic conditions. Other ethnic \nminorities (such as Man, Mongol, Uygur) are not affected by land acquisition and resettlement, \nas they are either located in urban areas or remote villages far from the alignment. Specific \nprovisions  such  as  livelihood  training,  employment  on  construction,  access  to  rural  credit, \nassistance with house construction, and social security are included in the resettlement plan. \nEthnic minorities are also included as a target group in the social development action plan \n(SDAP) to enhance benefits for poor or vulnerable people in the project area (Appendix 17). \n  \nH.  Social and Gender Aspects  \n69.  The Project will generate job opportunities for the poor, ethnic minorities, women, and \nother vulnerable groups, and will help develop their job skills. Sufficient areas for income-\ngenerating activities will be designated in and around the station. Construction and operation-\nrelated  job  opportunities  and  those  generated  from  the  Project  will  provide  potential  new \nsources of income for local residents. An increase in female participation in the labor and \ntourism market has the potential to increase women\u2019s net income and savings, improve overall \nfamily welfare, and improve the status of women; older women in particular tend to have less \nemployment opportunities than men. Through several programs along the alignment the All-\nChina Women\u2019s Federation will specifically address the needs of women and children. The \nfederation will operate even more actively in the project area so that women are able to take full \nadvantage  of  additional  work  and  income  opportunities  facilitated  by  the  Project  to  build \nbusinesses that help sustain their families. The federation also reported that children from \nhouseholds led by poor single woman will be helped to go to school. \n \n70.  Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from the Project, and have equal access \nto project-generated employment and wages. The railway will generate demand for local labor \nand increase worker productivity and wages. Under PRC law, women are given equal rights in \nemployment.  Expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  will  help  generate  additional \nemployment  opportunities  for  both  men  and  women.  Afforestation  activities  will  provide \nadditional employment opportunities for women relatively close to their homes. An increase in \nfemale participation in the labor and tourism market will increase women\u2019s net income and \nsavings potential, improving overall family welfare and the status of women.  \n \n71.  The construction and operation of the railway could have an impact on HIV/AIDS and \nSTIs due to the large number of workers during construction, expansion of the tourism industry, \nand insufficient knowledge on these issues. However, the project area has fewer cases of \nHIV/AIDS infection than southeast Henan.20 Both Henan and Shaanxi have an active public \ninformation program for HIV/AIDS awareness, including distribution of leaflets and posters, and \nradio and television education programs. In Henan, an HIV/AIDS survey and testing for the \nentire population were conducted in 2003, and Shaanxi will conduct a survey and testing this \nyear. Even the poor in remote areas have knowledge on prevention methods on HIV/AIDS and \n                                                 \n20 A government survey of blood sellers, carried out in Henan in the summer of 2004, reported 25,036 cases of \nHIV/AIDS (China Daily, 16 November 2004). Most were infected through illegal or inappropriate blood collection \nduring the mid-1990s (China Daily, 29 May 2004). Most of the HIV/AIDS victims in Henan province have been \nreceiving free medical treatment (China Daily, 3 March 2004). \n ", "  19 \nSTIs. The health departments in these provinces have ongoing awareness and prevention \nprograms, and voluntary counseling and testing for HIV/AIDS and STIs. \n \n72.  During  the  construction,  the  county  governments  along  the  alignment  will  increase \nawareness of workers and communities. MOR has experience implementing various awareness \nand prevention programs during railway construction. Medical clinics are established in the area \nof  construction  camps,  and  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaigns  and  preventive  measures  for \nworkers and communities are organized during railway construction.  \n \n73.  MOR has agreed with the SDAP, which will (i) enhance job opportunities for local \nresidents; (ii) provide training and vocational programs for poor, women, ethnic minorities, and \nthe vulnerable; (iii) support HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs; (iv) support income \nrecovery programs for people affected by resettlement; (v) provide awareness and prevention \nprograms  for  safety  during  construction  and  operation;  and  (vi)  promote  local  tourism \ndevelopment.  This  will  be  implemented  with  participation  from  relevant  local  government \nagencies, including poverty reduction offices; All-China Women\u2019s Federation; and health, civil \naffairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus. Leading groups have been formed to continue consultation \nand coordination among various agencies during implementation.  \n \nI.  Risks \n74.  The Project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with previous \nrailway projects, traffic demand is conservatively estimated as is passenger traffic. Sensitivity \ntests indicate that economic circumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the \nProject to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay \nthe realization of benefits. MOR has successfully built railway lines, such as the Hefei\u2013Xi\u2019an and \nJing\u2013Jiu railways. Government, MOR, HPG, and SPG support for the Project and its preparation \ncontributes to reducing the potential risk of implementation delays. Environmental risks will be \nmitigated by the measures in the environmental management plan (EMP) and will be closely \nmonitored during project implementation. \n \n75.  Resettlement will affect about 37,000 people as the railway alignment is routed to cause \nminimal resettlement. The resettlement plan includes preferential treatment for employment \nduring  construction, supply  of  local  materials,  allocation  of  commercial space near  railway \nstations, and job training. The resettlement plan and SDAP will be closely monitored to ensure \ncompliance with ADB social safeguard policies. \n \n76.  Intermodal competition among railways and roads will create market risks for the project \nrailway. However, the existing railway and road is already congested and capacity constraints \nare expected to worsen. Passenger surveys indicate that the railway has several advantages: \nlower fares, shorter travel times, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation \nof the joint-venture railway will help lower risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n77.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  Reform measures.

By the end \nof  2004,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  transport  system  comprised  about  74,400 \nkilometers (km) of railways, 1.86 million km of highways, 123,300 km of inland waterways, and \n2.05 million km of civil aviation routes. However, the density of the transport network ranks among \nthe  lowest  in  the  world  relative  to  either  population  or  geographic  area. From  1978,  when \neconomic reforms were first introduced, through to 2004, the PRC experienced sustained rapid \neconomic growth. This resulted in an accordingly rapid increase in demand for transportation. \nThe annual growth of passenger transport was 9% and freight transport 7.6% during 1978\u2013\n2004. In 2004, road traffic accounted for 53.7% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with \n35%, civil aviation with 10.9%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. The modal split for \nfreight ton-km was 58.4% for coastal and inland waterways, 28.9% for railways, 11.4% for \nroads, 1.2% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n2.  Recent  Developments.  To  improve  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  increased \ninvestment in transport infrastructure in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996\u20132000) and the Tenth \nFive-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). Investment in transport infrastructure as a share of gross domestic \nproduct more than doubled in the last decade. A World Bank study1 indicates that total transport \ninvestment should be increased to at least 3.8% of gross domestic product to avoid economic \ncosts associated with transport constraints. To meet the increase in transport demand, more \ninfrastructure investments are needed. The Government continues to accord high priority to \ntransport and substantial investments in the road and railway sectors from both domestic and \ninternational financing sources, including the private sector, are envisaged in the 11th Five-Year \nPlan (2006\u20132010), which is currently under preparation. \n \n3.  Future Development Priorities and Outlook. The 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) \nidentifies  transportation,  including  railway  development,  as  a  priority.  The  plan  envisages \n(i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide access to unserved areas with the network \nlength  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km,  (ii) providing  3,000 km  of  double  lines  and \nelectrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity, and (iii) increasing operating speeds on \n5,000 km  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines  reaching  15,000 km.  A  total  investment  of \nCNY350 billion, including CNY270 billion on capital construction and CNY80 billion for rolling \nstock,  is  planned  for  the  railway  sector.  During  2003\u20132007,  the  investments  for  capital \nconstruction are expected to reach CNY450 billion.  \n \n4.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new Railway Development Plan (up to 2020). \nThe plan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km to 85,000 km by 2010, and to \n100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal. Train speed will be raised to over \n200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be given to developing railways in \nunserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. The route \nnetwork length will be increased by 16,000 km to reach 40,000 km in the western region of the \nPRC  by  2020.  The  plan  also  calls  for  separating  passenger  and  freight  traffic  in  heavily \ntrafficked corridors and 12,000 km of passenger dedicated corridor will be developed by 2020. \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998.

Washington, DC.  \n ", "Appendix 3  29 \n5.  Other Development Partner Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation has provided \u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to \nexpand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal transport corridors. It has also financed \ndevelopment of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, the \nWorld Bank has provided 10 loans totaling $2.4 billion for nine national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project. \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Experience \n \n6.  Assistance  in  the  Sector.  ADB  has  focused  on  improving  infrastructure  in  less-\ndeveloped and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Since \n1989, ADB has provided 12 loans totaling about $2.2 billion to help finance the construction of \n1,921 km of new railway lines under eight local railway projects, and 4,138 km of new railway \nlines under four national railway projects. These projects have introduced modern technology \nand improved the efficiency of railway operation through institutional and structural reforms. \nADB  also  provided  10  technical  assistance  initiatives  totaling  $4.6 million  to  promote  the \ncommercial operation of railways, establish corporate governance, achieve cost recovery, and \nimprove railway management.  \n \n7.  Evaluation  of  Assistance.  Experience  from  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed \nrailway projects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of \nthe executing agencies for project implementation. The speed of implementation has often \nexceeded the expectations at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies generally complied \nwith  the  loan  covenants.  Resettlement  and  environmental  management  were  carried  out \nsatisfactorily. Audited financial statements were submitted in a timely manner, and the audited \nfinancial statements were found generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 12 railway projects, 5 are \ncomplete, 3 recently started commercial operation, and 4 are under implementation. The key \nlessons  highlight  the  need  to  (i) ensure  that  the  executing  agency  established  for  project \nprocessing and implementation has adequate capacity; (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; \n(iii) review constraints to traffic on a network basis, and the impact on project viability of the \nexisting and/or planned railway lines and other transportation modes that may compete with the \nproject  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway  projects  with  appropriately  determined  debt-equity \nratios. The railway projects have contributed to a dramatic transformation of local economies. \nThe per capita rural incomes in project areas increased substantially. Living standards were \nraised and poverty reduced. The project performance audit report2 for the ADB-financed Jing-Jiu \nrailway project in the PRC concluded that the project was successful and exceeded its original \npassenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC.  ADB Strategy \n \n8.  Strategy and Priorities. ADB strategy for the railway sector has three broad objectives: \n(i) improve economic efficiency, (ii) promote growth in poor inland provinces to reduce poverty, \nand  (iii) protect  the  environment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of  these  three \nobjectives, the strategy supports developing efficient and integrated transport networks to meet \nthe  needs  of  a  growing  market  economy  and  to  contribute  to  reducing  poverty  through \ninvestment targeting poorer areas coupled with policy and institutional reforms. Because of the \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nimportance of railway transport for development of the national economy, ADB strategy for the \nrailway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved \nareas that are less developed and poor, (ii) modernizing and increasing the capacity to improve \ntransport efficiency on key routes of the national railway system, (iii) commercializing railway \noperations to sustain efficient operations, and (iv) increasing railway competitiveness in the \ntransport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9.  Poverty  Reduction. ADB focuses on four issues to enhance the poverty reduction \nimpacts of transport investments: (i) locating ADB-financed projects in less-developed and poor \nregions where new lines will stimulate economic development, (ii) encouraging maximization of \nemployment  of  poor  people  during  project  construction  and  operation,  (iii) supplying  local \nmaterials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and  economy  from  poor  villages,  and \n(iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen project benefits to poor interior areas. \n \n10.  Governance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  restructuring  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  commercializing \noperations,  supporting  management  autonomy  of  railway  operations,  developing  human \nresources, and improving financial management and accounting systems. \n \n11.  Promoting Private Sector Development. The PRC\u2019s large infrastructure needs require \nlocal governments to shift from traditional financing modes to the capital markets. In the railway \nsector, a wider role for the private sector is envisaged. MOR has taken steps to create the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment and private sector sources. Possible areas include construction of industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12.  Regional Cooperation. The PRC is an active participant in three regional cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) through  Yunnan  province  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  (ii) through  the \nXinjiang Autonomous Region for the Central Asian republics initiative, and (iii) through Inner \nMongolia with Mongolia. Improving the cross-border trade regimes is a common feature of these \ninitiatives. Since these programs involve the poorer areas of the PRC, expanding regional \nmarkets and options could help reduce poverty. An agreement for facilitating the cross-border \nmovement of goods and people has been developed under the Greater Mekong Subregion \ninitiative.  Steps  are  being  taken  to  develop  an  institutional  framework  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation of regional transport projects, e.g., Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC railway \ndevelopment and the Pan-Asian railway project (Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  Monitoring Targets, Indicators, Modality, and Processes. The Government monitors \nand evaluates sector performance annually; these are reviewed through the process of the \ncountry strategy and program. Indicators for evaluating sector performance include (i) economic \ndevelopment and poverty indicators for the western region, (ii) transport density in relation to \nland area and population, (iii) public and private investment in railways, (iv) transport demand \nfor freight and passengers with modal split data, (v) level of user charges (railway construction \nsurcharges, etc.), and (vi) cross-border traffic volumes with the Central Asian republics, Greater \nMekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  31 \nTable A3: Railway Sector Road Map \n \n  Indicators \nItem \n1999  2004  2009 \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an Railway (ZXR) Project is the first of the eight dedicated passenger \nlines in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The objective of the Project, which connects \nZhengzhou  in  Henan  province  with  Xi\u2019an  in  Shaanxi  province,  is  to  promote  sustainable \neconomic growth by enhancing transportation capability in an unserved area, thereby creating \nemployment and income-enhancing opportunities, raising incomes, and reducing poverty. To \nachieve this objective, a corporate entity is being set up to construct, operate, and manage the \nProject; and assist in facilitating economic developments, such as tourism, as well as value-\nadded and labor-intensive industries in the project area. The consulting services are to assist in \n(i) strengthening institutional, marketing, and business development functions of the Project \nCompany; and (ii) researching and strengthening the development, operation, and management \nof dedicated passenger railway systems in the PRC.  \n \nB.   Scope \n2.  For the first component, the consultants will (i) help with institutional strengthening of the \nProject Company for its successful operation in a market environment; (ii) determine the level of \ntourism,  industry  and  market  development  expertise  of  the  Project  Company;  (iii) research \nprograms  and  incentives  available  for  attracting  tourist  and  related industry  at  the  county, \nprefecture,  and  province  levels;  (iv) meet  with  a  selection  of  potential  shippers  located  or \nplanning to locate along the route of the ZXR; (v) meet with business people of Zhengzhou, \nLuoyang, Sanmexia, and Xi\u2019an to determine current operations and future inland transport \nrequirements including for export to Central Asia and Europe; (vi) develop plans for improving \nrailway services, for passengers (including tourists) and freight (particularly container services); \n(vii) propose measures to develop industrial sidings; and (viii) improve marketing of railway \nservices to targeted customers both passenger and freight. \n \n3.  For  the  second  component,  the  consultants  will  (i) research  and  strengthen  the \ndevelopment, operation, and management of the passenger-dedicated railway systems in the \nPRC, and (ii) recommend actions and changes including institutional efforts to make these \npassenger  dedicated  railways  more  market  oriented  and  competitive.  The  international \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants.  \n \nC.  Expertise and Cost Estimates \n4.  About 20 person-months of international consulting services will be engaged using the \nsimplified  technical  proposal  procedures  based  on  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  in \naccordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  provisions  of  the  ADB \nanticorruption policy will be included in all invitation documents and contracts for international \nconsultants. The international consultants will have expertise in business development and \nmarketing, international trade, and railway operation. The loan will finance the services of the \ninternational consultants. \n \n5.  MOR and the Project Company will (i) assign appropriate counterpart staff to liaise with \nand facilitate the work of consulting services; (ii) provide suitable office accommodation and \ncommunications  facilities  commensurate  with  requirements;

Traffic Forecast \n \n1.  The  Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an  Railway  (ZXR)  is  an  integral  part  of  the  national  dedicated \npassenger railway network envisioned in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The national \nnetwork will encompass 5,000 route-kilometers (km) by 2010 and 12,000 route-km by 2020 \nalong four east-west and four north-south directions, incorporating cutting-edge technologies in \nsignaling, telecommunications, automatic train control systems, and safety equipment. ZXR is \nalso an integral part of the key railway corridor connecting western and central PRC with \neastern and coastal regions of the country. The configuration and operational strategy of the \nZXR Project shows that appropriately this is a corridor development project. The activities under \nthe Project will enhance the capacity for railway transportation for both passenger trains and \nfreight trains along the ZXR corridor, which comprises the existing mixed service Zhengzhou\u2013\nXi\u2019an section (Zhengxi) of the Longhai railway and the new passenger-dedicated ZXR line. \n2.  Freight  traffic  for  the  Longhai  railway  line  was  forecast  by  commodity  (i.e.,  coal, \npetroleum products, iron and steel, fertilizers, intermodal containers, and other commodities) in \ntwo categories differentiated by their economic impact: (i) traffic diverted from other modes, \nmainly from other national railway routes and roads, based on an assessment of the relative \nservice and cost competitiveness of the Zhengxi; and (ii) generated traffic that would only move \nbecause  of  the  additional  freight-carrying  capacity  created  on  Zhengxi  by  shifting  existing \npassenger trains to ZXR. The traffic forecast was based on a three-tier analysis: (i) national \ntransport demand based on historical trends; (iii) national railway traffic demand based on \ncommodity-specific analysis for major commodities currently using and expected to use the \nexisting Zhengxi section of the Longhai railway; and (iv) Zhengxi section traffic projections \nbased on the railway investment strategy (RIS-III) model of the Ministry of Railways (MOR).1 \nTraffic  projections  considered  expected  economic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism \ndevelopment potential, local government development plans, market surveys, and assessments \nof technical assistance (TA) consultants and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) mission. The \nfreight volume on the Zhengxi section is forecast to increase from about 16.14 billion ton-km in \n2011 to 49.02 billion ton-km in 2031, with average annual growth rate of 5.7%. Passenger traffic \nwas forecast based on similar factors, with a particular focus on tourism development potential.2 \nPassenger traffic is forecast to grow from 15.65 billion passenger-km in 2011 to 50.37 billion \npassenger-km in 2031, with an average annual growth rate of 6.0% (Table A13.1). \n3.  Transportation improvements will facilitate the development of natural resources and \nassociated industries. Local governments are seeking private sector companies to invest in their \nareas, particularly in manufacturing and tourism. Freight and passenger traffic forecasts are \nconsidered reasonable given that (i) the Zhengxi section of the Longhai railway is currently \nhighly congested with a traffic density of 120.27 million traffic units (ton-km+passenger-km) per \nkm, four times the average national railway\u2019s density of 30.18 million traffic units per km, which \nin itself is the highest traffic density in the PRC; (ii) railways in the PRC have experienced high \nannual traffic growth with recent rates higher than the assumed growth rates for freight and \npassenger traffic; (iii) the Project is a critical link connecting western PRC with the east, as well \nas serving as a gateway to the PRC-Eurasian rail network for intermodal transport;3 and (iv) \n                                                 \n1  This model, developed with assistance of the World Bank, is a sophisticated tool to analyze forecast modal split \nand network flows in the PRC based on a variety of factors, including capacity, socioeconomic variables, and \ncosts. \n2  The ZXR passes through areas recognized as the \u201cCradle of Ancient China,\u201d and includes temples, grottos, tombs, \nand other relics from the ancient dynasties dating back 3,000 years.  \n3  An International Union of Railways (UIC)-sponsored protocol was executed by 26 nations in Washington on 8 April \n2005 to establish seamless rail transport service between the PRC and Europe with onward trans-Atlantic marine \nservice to the eastern United States. \n ", "Appendix 13  45 \nfreeing up transport capacity on the Zhengxi section will result in substantially more traffic for \nboth passenger and freight transport.  \nB.  Economic Evaluation \n \n4.  Cost. The economic evaluation is based on a comparison of with- and without-project \nscenarios, using constant 2005 economic prices. The project benefits and cost were revalued in \neconomic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment, \nnontradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in CNY using the domestic \nprice numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign exchange effects. A \nshadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not \non wages for skilled labor since no clear surplus of skilled workers exists. A shadow wage rate \nfactor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of \nlabor. \n \n5.  Benefits. The economic benefits consist of (i) passenger and freight transport cost \nsavings to passengers and freight shippers, respectively, for diverted freight and passenger \ntraffic; (ii) generated passenger transport benefits estimated by the difference in economic cost \nof railway and bus transport; (iii) time savings in diverted passenger and freight traffic based on \nthe value of time estimated from the net income of local residents and average value of freight; \n(iv) net economic value calculated on the basis of the economic value per additional ton of each \ncommodity of generated traffic as a result of the construction of the ZXR; (v) net economic value \nof generated tourist days by estimating the number of tourists and average expenditure, and \nconsidering the cost of providing the tourist services; and (vi) avoided road construction and \nmaintenance costs, accident costs, and shipper savings due to increased railway competition. \nThe salvage value was calculated based on the economic life of each project component. \n \n6.  Alternative Analysis. Alternative transport modes and designs, particularly roads, were \nassessed  to  determine  the  least-cost  option  to  provide  sufficient  capacity  to  cater  to  the \nexpected demand. Building an electrified double-track railway in this corridor was considered \nviable  to  meet  the  anticipated  traffic  demand  at  this  stage,  given  the  railway  network \ndevelopment,  type  of  cargo  and  passengers,  and  energy  efficiency.  Seven  alternative \nalignments were subsequently evaluated during the feasibility study for the following stations \nand sections: Zhengzhou terminal approach, Luoyang south station, line around Youguguan in \nSanmenxia, Sanmenxia station location, Caijiapo landslide alternatives, Fushui\u2013Weinan south \nroute, and Xi\u2019an terminal approach. Criteria adopted included railway length, cost estimates, \nlength  and  difficulty  of  the  construction  of  bridges  and  tunnels,  construction  period,  local \ngovernment development plans, and environmental and social impacts, including resettlement. \n \n7.  Conclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 17.4% (Table \nA13.3). Benefits from the freight traffic, including generated commodity production, are the \nmajor economic benefit (84%), followed by equal weights of 8% each for passenger benefits \nand other benefits. Sensitivity analysis tested 10 scenarios to assess the robustness of the \nresults of the economic analysis (Table A13.4). The capital cost would have to be more than \n33% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the \nexperience of ADB-financed projects in the railway sector, this switching value is unlikely to \noccur. ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC have not encountered major cost overruns, \nand the contract prices tend to be lower than estimated because the contracting process is \nbecoming increasingly competitive. The freight and passenger benefits would have to decrease \nmore than 30% and 323%, respectively to make the Project economically nonviable. A reduction \nin the generated production by 415% and a 1-year delay in completion do not affect economic \nviability. Combinations of adverse effects of benefits and costs were also tested. The result \nshowed that the Project would maintain its economic viability under plausible scenarios of \nvariability. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 13 \n \n8.  The economic analysis was extended to quantify project risk and distribute project net \nbenefits among stakeholders. The risk analysis, based on the statistical method, considers the \npossible value for key variables, including capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, \npassenger traffic,  freight  traffic,  and  net  economic  value  of  generated  production;  and  the \nprobability with which they may occur. The result shows that the EIRR would exceed 12% with \n97% probability. Distribution analysis distributed project net benefits by determining the project \neffects for project beneficiaries, such as project users, labor, and government (Table A13.2). A \nlarge proportion (CNY34 billion) of net benefits will accrue to the project users. \n \nTable A13.1: Traffic Forecast \n Item   2011 2016 2021 2026  2031 \nFreight Traffic \n  Tons (million)

PERFORMANCE AND ANALYSIS \n \nA.  General \n1.  The projected financial statements of the proposed Zhengzhou\u2013Xian Railway (ZXR) \nProject were prepared in current terms for 2006\u20132031. Construction will be completed in August \n2011; the trial operation will follow; and the first full year of full operation will be 2012. The \nforeign and local inflation rates are assumed at 2% and 3% during the projection period. The \ncost estimates are presented in current terms taking into account the potential impacts of \ndomestic and international inflation. \n \nB.  Financial Projections \n \n2.  Operating revenues from tariffs are projected based on forecast of future traffic and a \nbase average tariff rate of CNY0.27 per passenger per kilometer.1 A set of tariffs was devised, \nbased on full cost recovery plus an adequate return on equity, to achieve close to optimum \nfinancial and economic performance of A and B classes of trains operating for the transit, \ninterline, and local traffic with due consideration of affordability2 (Table A14.1). The tariff charges \nare assumed to increase in current terms once every 5 years to keep up with about two thirds of \ninflation (10% increase in 5 years). No real increase in tariffs will occur over the Project\u2019s life \nspan. Other revenues, including loading and unloading, warehouse storage, parcel service in \nthe train stations, amounts to 4.5% of passenger revenue.  \n \nTable A14.1 Proposed Tariff for ZXR (Unit: CNY/pkm) \nTrain Type  Transit  Interline  Local \nTraffic  Traffic  Traffic \nClass A  0.38  0.33  0.20 \nClass B  0.30  0.25  0.15 \n      CNY = yuan, pkm = passenger-kilometer, ZXR = Zhengzhou-Xi\u2019an Railway. \n      Sources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  Annual incremental operating costs are estimated based on 2005 prices as follows: (i) \nfixed cost CNY4.1 million per train-kilometer (km); fixed cost is assumed to rise at a growth rate \nof 3% in real terms; (ii) passenger variable cost of CNY0.06 per passenger-km, and increase in \nline with passenger traffic flows; (iii) estimated cost of dry lease of rolling stock is CNY8.6 per \ntrain-km3; and (iv) other nonoperating expenses are assumed at CNY0.025 per passenger-km. \nAll incremental operating costs are projected to increase annually in line with domestic inflation \nrates. In addition, periodic track-laying maintenance will be required after 10 years of operation \nat a cost of CNY4.6 million per track-km in 2005 prices, electric power and traction will be \nreplaced after 15 years of operation at a cost of CNY1,553 million in 2005 prices, and signal and \ncommunication will be purchased after 20 years of operation at a cost of CNY2,727 million in \n2005 prices.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Comparable with the existing bus fare of CNY0.28/pkm.  \n2  The low fare structure for local service will also substantially benefit the people living in the project area. \n3  Rolling stock costs are estimated by the Ministry of Railways at CNY8 billion for equipment intended for use in the \nnational dedicated passenger network. This equipment consists of a fleet of electrical multiple units (EMUs), which \nwill not be specifically assigned to the ZXR. MOR will separately finance the procurement of EMUs and charge a \nfee based on train-kilometer (km) to ZXR and other passenger railways. The per-km rate will be based on dry-lease \nterms and will include depreciation charges (5% per year) and 6% return on investment \n ", "Appendix 14  49 \n4.  The accounts receivable turnover period is assumed at 0.5 month of the annual revenue \nand 2 months of the total working expenses for accounts payable. The Project Company will \nemploy 3,509 employees (7.24 per km) compared with 25 per km for the Ministry of Railways \n(MOR). The average annual average wages and other costs are CNY 30,000.  \n \n5.  Depreciation is calculated on a straight line depreciation method with an average life of \nabout 65 years for the main railway structure, 10 years for the track-laying component, 15 years \nfor electric power and traction, and 20 years for signal and communications. The weighted \naverage depreciation value is 2.2% per year. Applicable business taxes at a grossed up rate of \n3.24% are charged on revenue. Corporate income tax at 33% is paid on income after deducting \nbusiness taxes, depreciation and interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year \nlosses carried forward.  \n \n6.  The Project will be funded 50% by equity or grants and 50% by long-term loans. The \nChina Development Bank (CDB) loan will be repayable over 20 years, including a 6-year grace \nperiod. The ADB loan will have a 26-year maturity, including a 6-year grace period, and be a US \ndollar LIBOR-based loan with a 0.75% commitment fee.  \n \n7.  Projected financial statements are presented in Table A14.2. The projected financial \nstatements indicate that the forecast revenue under the base assumptions are sufficient to \ncover annual recurrent costs, depreciation, debt repayments on the ADB and CDB loans, and \ngenerate reasonable profits from the railway operation upon the first full year of operation. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis  \n \n8.  The major assumptions used for calculation of a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nare (i) all calculations are based on 2005 prices, covering 2006\u20132031; (ii) capital costs include \nall incremental capital expenditures related to construction and equipment for the railway, but \nexclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operation costs include all \nannual incremental expenses incurred in operating the project railway, but exclude depreciation \nand debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from tariff used in financial projections \nare adjusted to 2005 prices; (v) the residual value equal to undepreciated value of capital \ninvestment is included as a benefit of the FIRR calculation.  \n \n9.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after-tax, in real terms was \ncalculated using estimated capital mix and cost of funds. Costs have been considered as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 10-year LIBOR (London interbank offered rate) fixed swap rate plus a \nprovision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is used for ADB debt, (ii) the estimated interest costs of \n5.51% per annum is used for the domestic loan funds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed \nto be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted to reflect the impact of income tax of 33%. The \nnominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost of debt by applying domestic and international \naverage inflation rate for local currency and foreign exchange denominated debt respectively.  \n \n10  The FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 7%, which compares \nfavorably with the WACC, computed at an after-tax basis of 3% (Table A14.3). The Project is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate conditions causing \nthe Project's viability to fall below the WACC are unlikely to occur.

The  project  railway  alignment  is  459  kilometers  (km)  long  and  will  cross  170  rural \nvillages and 13 urban village neighborhoods in 19 counties and urban districts from Zhengzhou \nin  Henan  province  to  Xi\u2019an  in  Shaanxi  province.  The  resettlement  plan  (RP)  addresses \npermanent  and  temporary  impacts  caused  by  the  Project,  including  the  railway  alignment, \nstation  sites,  station  access  roads,  and  related  construction  activities.  An  estimated  1,782 \nhectares (ha) of land will be permanently acquired, of which about 63% is currently under \ncultivation, 8% orchard, 11% housing plots, 2% forest, 4% grassland, and 12% wasteland. The \nnumber of affected people in terms of loss of land is equivalent to 16,147, assuming total loss of \ncultivated land based on average per capita landholdings. The Project will also temporarily \nrequire an estimated 596 ha. About 1,682,392 square meters (m2) of structures will be affected, \nof which 79% are residential. Relocation of 29,774 people will be required. The Project will also \nrequire 46,426 m2 of schools and 302,087 m2 of factories and other enterprises to be relocated. \nThe  total  number  of  people  directly  affected  is  estimated  at  36,736.  A  summary  of  the \nresettlement impacts are shown in Table A15.1. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were \nminimized by aligning the railway away from urban areas, village centers, and other facilities, \nwhere possible, based on consultations with communities. \n \n2.  The Ministry of Railways (MOR) in consultation with provincial and local governments \nprepared the RP based on the preliminary design study, village surveys of all 170 rural villages \nand 13 village urban neighborhoods; 2,354 household surveys; provincial, prefecture, and local \ngovernment  statistics;  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected \nhouseholds.  The  resettlement  objective  is  to  ensure  that  compensation  and  entitlements \nprovided to affected people are adequate to at least maintain their without-project standard of \nliving, with prospects of improvement, in line with the Land Administration Law (1998) and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  (1995).  People  losing  land, \nhousing, other assets, or other means of production will be compensated at replacement cost \nand assisted in restoring their incomes and living standards. In 2004, the PRC Constitution was \namended to ensure that people are compensated according to law for land expropriated for \npublic projects, and the State Council issued Decree No. 28 on Further Reform to Strictly \nImplement Land Administration, which requires public consultation with affected people prior to \napproval  of  projects,  maintenance  of  the  living  standard  of  affected  people,  strengthened \nmonitoring procedures, public accounting of the receipt and distribution of resettlement funds, \nand distribution of compensation for land loss principally to affected people.  \n \n3.  The RP stipulates eligibility/entitlement provisions for affected people.1 Permanent land \nlosses will be compensated by land reallocation or by cash payments. Each rural village will \nutilize  the  land  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidy  for  income  restoration.  The  main \nstrategies for income restoration include land readjustment, improvement of irrigation systems, \ndevelopment of animal husbandry and cash crops, small business development, and migration \nto urban centers for employment. Compensation for temporary land loss will be paid directly to \npeople affected to offset any income loss; also, the land will be restored to its original state after \nuse. Compensation for rural housing losses will be paid directly to those affected at replacement \ncost, free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. The affected rural houses will be \nrebuilt in scattered locations within the existing village, so minimal site development is required. \nBetter road access and provision of site leveling, water supply, electricity, telephone, and cable \nwill be provided. Crop and tree losses will be directly paid to those affected and used at their \ndiscretion. Urban households, factories, schools and other institutions, and enterprises will be \npaid compensation at market rates for relocation and reconstruction. Urban households can \n                                                 \n1  A detailed entitlement matrix is included in Table 5-5 of the Resettlement Plan (RP).  \n ", "54  Appendix 15 \nselect new housing, which is widely available. Most factories will only suffer partial impacts and \ncontinue operations at the same site. For factories required to relocate, each owner will prepare \na relocation plan, which includes restoration of livelihoods and incomes for all workers. Schools \nand other institutions will be rebuilt based on the plans of local government, to ensure that \nservice levels are maintained or improved. \n \n4.  The resettlement impacts for the railway project are spread thinly over a long, narrow \ncorridor. Investigations showed that income loss from land acquisition is less severe because \nthis corridor is developing rapidly and at least 70% of net income for more than half of rural \nhouseholds comes from nonagricultural employment and small businesses. Special assistance \nwill be provided to any seriously affected villages and groups, especially vulnerable households \nthat include the poor, widows, and disabled. Special measures will also be provided for any \naffected ethnic minority households. Ethnic minorities account for 0.65% of the population of \naffected villages and village-level urban units on the alignment, most are Hui. \n \n5.  Local  government  land  administration  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nresettlement; many activities will be carried out by township officials and village committees. \nMOR and the local governments have extensive experience with resettlement. As a standard \nprocedure,  local  government  will  provide  training  to  local  officials  who  will  be  involved  in \nimplementation. The training will focus on ADB requirements, as specified in the RP, and new \nprocedures related to State Council Decree No. 28. Affected people have been informed and \nconsulted about project impacts, and resettlement policies and entitlements at various stages. \nDuring  the  preliminary  design  stage,  stakeholders  consulted  included  heads  of  affected \nhouseholds; village heads and representatives; local government agencies and departments; \nand  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  ethnic  minorities.  Resettlement  information \nbooklets were distributed to affected villages in April 2005. Affected households will also be \nconsulted and can participate in resettlement activities, including the detailed measurement \nsurvey, location of underpasses, new housing sites, and grievance redress. \n \n6.  The estimated land acquisition and resettlement cost is $181.4 million, excluding the \ncosts for enterprise relocation and infrastructure to be relocated.2 In December 2004, MOR and \nHenan and Shaanxi provincial governments signed agreements whereby the local governments \nwill fund 100% of the cost of land acquisition and resettlement, which in turn will be an equity \ncontribution  to  the  Project.  The  resettlement  budget  will  be  adjusted  based  on  the  actual \nmeasurement  of  physical  losses  and  market  prices.  The  RP  will  be  updated  by  local \ngovernments to include (i) final compensation standards and rates that conform to Decree No. \n28, (ii) refined impact figures based on detailed design, (iii) rehabilitation plans for any seriously \naffected  villages,  and  for  enterprises  to  be  relocated,  (iv)  detailed  budgets  for  each \nprovince/municipality; and (v) an updated implementation schedule. This updated RP will be \ndisclosed to affected people, and submitted to ADB for approval prior to the commencement of \nland acquisition and demolition, which is anticipated in September 2005. \n \n7.  MOR and municipal land acquisition and resettlement offices, in collaboration with the \ncounty  resettlement  offices,  will  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  of \ncompensation payments, house rebuilding/relocation for affected people, land redistribution, \nand grievance redress. MOR will prepare progress reports and submit them to ADB on a \nquarterly  basis,  until  resettlement  is  completed.  MOR  will  then  prepare  a  resettlement \ncompletion report for submission to ADB. In addition, MOR will contract an independent monitor \n                                                 \n2  The latest resettlement cost is estimated at $240 million including the costs for enterprise and infrastructure \nrelocation and the contingences; this increase is well within the contingency amount included in the project cost \nestimates. The resettlement cost will be finalized in the updated RP. \n ", "  Appendix 15  55 \nto carry out the external monitoring and evaluation. The tasks include (i) conduct baseline \nsurvey;  (ii)  review  and  verify  the  compensation  payments,  status  of  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation payments; (iii) assessment of grievance redress procedures, affected people's \nreaction/satisfaction, and restoration of livelihoods; and (iv) compile lessons learned for future \nresettlement planning. The external monitor will prepare monitoring reports for submission to \nMOR and ADB every 6 months until completion of resettlement activities; thereafter, annual \nevaluation investigations will be conducted for at least 2 years and reported to MOR and ADB. \n \nTable A15.1: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n  Henan  Shaanxi   \nImpact  Province  Province  Total \n No. of counties/districts crossed          11  8  17 \n No. of townships crossed       44  28  72 \n No. of urban street units crossed        0  13  13 \n No. of rural villages crossed       71  99  170 \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national   Yes   Yes \npriority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty analysis?     No   No \nagreement?  \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nImproved railway transport will provide an enabling condition for poverty reduction through improved access to markets, \nemployment, advanced education and medical facilities, new knowledge and information, families working or studying \nin other regions, and other social and economic services; and will facilitate economic development and job creation. \nImproved access to markets opens up opportunities for expansion of locally produced goods and services. Construction \nand  operation  of  the  railway  generates  additional  employment  opportunities  in  local  communities,  providing  an \nadditional source of income for people, including poor households in the project area. Incoming passengers and tourists \ngenerate additional demand for locally produced goods and services. In addition, local government construction of \naccess and connector roads for railway construction and development of local roads from the stations to all levels of the \nroad network and poor villages will help to extend the project benefits and opportunities to rural poor communities by \nimproving local infrastructure; reducing transport costs; increasing access to markets, employment, and other economic \nand social services; and improving conditions for economic growth shared by the poor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                      Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe alignment is more developed than many similarly mountainous parts of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nHowever, many villages located in the mountains have been isolated from these developments, and remain very poor \nwith intransient poverty. The links between poverty, topography, and transport systems are apparent in the project area. \nThe main causes of poverty in the project areas are (i) natural calamity, (ii) lack of infrastructure, (iii) very limited and \nunsustainable source of livelihood, (vi) uneven economic development, and (v) poor health. The Project will benefit \nabout 9.3 million people. About 90.2% are rural (17 counties) and 15% are poor with a net income per capita of less \nthan CNY900 in 2004. In urban areas (2 counties), 5.8% are poor with a less than per capita income of minimum living \nstandards.1 This means about 14% of the total population are poor in the project area. The railway passes through19 \ncounties,  6  are  designated  as  national  and  provincial  poverty  counties,  and  725  designated  poverty  villages. \nApproximately 1.3 million poor individuals are resident in the area, about 0.65% are ethnic minorities.  \n \nAbout 353,000 person-years of work will be created during railway construction, 60% will be unskilled work. Half of the \nunskilled work will be targeted for the poor, totaling 105,920 person-years at total wages of CNY1,037 million or \nCNY9,790 per person-year. Priority will be given to women, resettlement-affected people, and other vulnerable people. \nIn addition, during construction, 6,249 person-years of local jobs will be created in the provision of construction \nmaterials with total wages of CNY61.4 million, of which 1,875 person-years will be for the poor, with total wages of \nCNY18.4 million or annual average wage of CNY9,828 per capita. When the operation of the new railway starts, \napproximately 2,988 additional jobs will be created with total wages of CNY53.7 million annually for CNY1344.5 million \nduring the 25-year operation period. An estimated tax revenue from the Project to counties in the project areas is \nCNY714 million. This added revenue will be used for a range of poverty reduction and social activities including \nmitigation of negative impacts on HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and \nSTIs (sexually transmitted infections), human trafficking, and the environment, with special attention to resettlement-\naffected groups, women, ethnic groups and other vulnerable people in the project area. The Project\u2019s 10 railway \nstations, which will be connected to all levels of road network accessible by all villages including the poor, will create \nvarious jobs, and help distribute the benefits in the project area. Sufficient space will be provided in and around the \nstations for local area development; the poor, women, ethnic groups and other vulnerable people will be supported by \nlocal governments to sell local specialties and other goods and services. All of these direct and indirect impacts of the \nProject will provide conditions for the country\u2019s goal of micro-urbanization for poor families to (i) move away from \nunsustainable, mountainous farmlands; (ii) have better access to markets, and advanced educational and health \nfacilities especially for pregnant women; and (iii) build a sustainable future in new centers of economic activity, and \ncomplement the poverty reduction activities of local governments to achieve the goal, such as assisting the poor with \nurban migration, relocation, employment, local economic development, farmer-based rural tourism, agricultural product \ndevelopment, and health and physical infrastructure and natural resources improvement. These concerted efforts will \npromote progress in attaining the Millennium Development Goals, especially goals 1 and 3\u20137.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \nVarious public consultation and participation activities for the Project have been conducted and the role of each \nstakeholder is identified. MOR, Fourth Survey Design Institute, the project preparation technical assistance consultants \nand ADB mission have had formal and informal consultations with local communities and government agencies through \nmeetings, surveys, household interviews, written communications, workshops, and such, involving about 10,000 \npeople. The local county and township governments and communities will assist MOR in acquiring land, implementing \nthe resettlement plan (RP), and organizing local labor for construction and local development including the station area \nto ensure the participation and benefit of the poor, women, and other vulnerable people. \n                                                 \n1  2003 data were used: annual per capita income in Henan, CNY1,145, and in Shaanxi, CNY1,566. \n ", "58       Appendix 16 \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes           No \nThe participation of local people will be central for improving their opportunities to benefit from the Project. Local groups \nand relevant government agencies will continue to be involved in the consultation and participation process, especially \nduring the implementation of the environmental impact assessment and RP. Railway construction support offices are \nbeing set up in each project county, and will have copies of all relevant documents. During construction and operation, \nthey will serve as a key coordinating point to enhance stakeholder participation, including the poor, women, ethnic \ngroups, and other vulnerable people. A leading group will be formed in each prefecture in the project area among the \nrelevant government agencies at different levels including village groups; poverty reduction offices; All-China Women\u2019s \nFederation; and health, civil affairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus to continue the process of consultation and participation \nand to coordinate activities by various agencies to ensure local benefits. A social development action plan (SDAP) was \nprepared and will increase participation of local people in project activities and benefits. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAnalyses of gender-disaggregated data and discussions with representatives of the All-China Women\u2019s Federation \nindicate that women will need some assistance to fully benefit from the Project. Data collected indicate the following: (i) \nwomen primarily engage in agricultural activities; and (ii) male members from poor households tend to travel further for \nmigrant labor opportunities than nonpoor males, leaving behind a high percentage of households headed by women. \nThe construction of the railway will create opportunities for local area development by (i) facilitating flow of materials and \ninformation into the area, and (ii) accelerating development of local industry and tourism. Many of the service sector jobs \nwill favor women employees. The All-China Women\u2019s Federation will provide business management and financial \nassistance to women interested in setting up small businesses to serve construction crews and growing tourist sector  \n \nPoverty and social enhancement measures have been built into the project design, and special mitigation (or protection) \nactions have been included in the RP. For example, members of the community will collectively decide where schools \nwill be relocated. Women, especially female heads of household, will be consulted as schools provide an informal \nsource of day care for their children. Poor women will receive assistance so that their children can remain in school, \nfreeing women\u2019s time during the day to work. Widows will be eligible for special assistance during land acquisition and \nresettlement. Women will be given priority for project-generated employment during construction and operation of the \nrailway. The rise in female participation in the labor force and tourism market will increase women\u2019s net income, thus \nimproving overall family welfare, and increasing the status of women. \nHas an output been prepared?    Yes, see SDAP    No \nE.
