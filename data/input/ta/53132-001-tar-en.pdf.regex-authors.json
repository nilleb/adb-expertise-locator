INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support efforts of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs) to address remaining poverty \nand inequality by improving health outcomes of DMCs through (i) identification and preparation \nof concept notes for health projects, (ii) health sector assessments and analyses to identify best \npractices and implementation bottlenecks, and (iii) development of health sector capacity in DMCs. \n \n2.  The TA1 is included in the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s \n2019 results-based work plan and will provide needed support for the implementation of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030,2 particularly operational priority 1 to address remaining poverty and reduce \ninequalities, and operational priority 7 to promote regional cooperation and integration. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Many countries in Asia and the Pacific have made great strides in poverty reduction and \neconomic growth. However, there are unfinished development agendas, including the need to \nimprove health outcomes and to attain and sustain universal health coverage (UHC). Issues that \nmust be addressed include (i) epidemiological and demographic transitions such as increasing \nnoncommunicable  diseases,  aging,  and  rapid  population  growth  in  many  countries;  (ii) \nurbanization and subsequent growth of the urban poor; (iii) migration and displacement resulting \nin increased pressure on health and other social services; (iv) threats of disease outbreak, which \npose constant challenges to health systems; (v) the adaptation of health systems to be sensitive \nand responsive to the needs of women across the whole life cycle; (vi) the use of e-health to \nmaximize health system efficiency;3 and (vii) strengthening of local governments\u2019 role in delivering \nhealth care in decentralized settings. Emerging trends, such as technological advancements, \nincreased emphasis on multisector collaboration, rising demand for quality health care as nations \nget richer, and economies graduating from donor support, present further opportunities and \nchallenges in achieving UHC. \n \n4.  Strategy 2030 sets the course for ADB to respond more effectively to these changing \nneeds,  emerging  opportunities,  and  challenges.  ADB  will  promote  the  use  of  innovative \ntechnologies, particularly scalable e-health solutions in the health sector, by delivering integrated \nstrategies and bringing in expertise across a range of sectors and themes through a mix of public \nand private sector operations. ADB will continue to partner with DMCs as they pursue UHC by \nscaling up its assistance in the design and implementation of interventions to address three core \naspects of achieving UHC: (i) expanding health coverage, (ii) improving quality of care, and (iii) \nfinancial protection for all. ADB will support efforts to address emerging regional challenges to \nachieving UHC, which include managing the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases, \nresponding  to  the  need  for  elderly  care  in  a  cost-effective  and  sustainable  manner,  and \nstrengthening regional health security.4 These contributions are expected to ultimately improve \nhealth outcomes for all people, independent of their ability to pay. \n                                                \n1  This TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 June 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  E-health refers to a range of strategies for integrating innovative technologies to improve health systems, including \nsupporting the development of new strategies and investment cases, and enabling the interoperability of existing \nhealth information systems within and between countries. \n4  Regional health security refers to activities required to minimize vulnerability to acute public health events that        \n    endanger the collective health of populations living across geographical regions and international boundaries.  \n \n \n ", "2 \n \n5.  This support for DMCs will build on the increasing number of recently committed, approved, \nand proposed sovereign and nonsovereign health projects. Gains made under the Operational \nPlan for Health 2015\u201320205 have resulted in increased focus on health, reflected by the rising \nnumber of health sector projects approved and committed by ADB\u2019s operations departments. \nCurrent  and  planned  operational  priorities  include  (i)  the  implementation  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund 12 set-aside for regional health security; (ii) the expansion of ADB\u2019s presence \nin e-health; (iii) the engagement of health sector-related policy dialogue with at least 20 DMCs; \n(iv) the convening of knowledge events on emerging issues at the national, regional, and global \nlevels; and (v) the production and compilation of knowledge products, which capture knowledge \ngenerated since the approval of the Operational Plan for Health 2015\u20132020 in March 2015. \n \n6.  Despite progress in several health-specific areas, ADB needs to continue and deepen its \nsupport to DMCs to develop and implement UHC strategies, plans, policies, or programs. Timely \npolicy dialogue and enhanced capacities by ADB\u2019s operations departments and resident missions \nwill support the exploration, development, and preparation of sovereign and nonsovereign health \nprojects with DMCs. \n \n7.  The  TA  provides  the  needed  knowledge  and  technical  inputs  that  will  support  the \nprioritization, development, and institutionalization of innovations and best practices to accelerate \nthe achievement of UHC. The synthesis of common themes and lessons learned across country-\nlevel and regional reviews and the compilation of a network of professionals with health expertise \nin the Asia and Pacific region will strengthen ADB\u2019s ability to respond to regional health issues. It \nwill build on previous work generated by the Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease \nThreats Trust Fund (RMTF) and the regional TA for Universal Health Coverage for Inclusive \nGrowth: Supporting the Implementation of the Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020. RMTF \ncontributed to the reduction of risk from drug-resistant malaria and other communicable disease \nthreats in the Asia and Pacific region and helped mobilized increased domestic funding for malaria \nelimination in the Greater Mekong subregion with the funding tripling from $90 million in 2013 to \nmore than $300 million in 2018.6  The regional UHC for Inclusive Growth TA has supported the \ndevelopment of knowledge products including  health financing and service delivery diagnostics \nneeded to inform country-led UHC policies and reforms. Priority areas will continue to be \nsupported, including regional health security, national health insurance and other health financing \nsystems, promotion of e-health, contracting of health care providers, demand analysis of hospitals, \nnoncommunicable  diseases,  and  other  health  system  issues.  The  TA  will  facilitate  ADB\u2019s \nexpanded presence in the health sector in Asia and the Pacific, ultimately allowing ADB to be \nbetter positioned to help DMCs fill investment gaps to achieve UHC in a manner that is both timely \nand responsive to their needs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: access to needed quality health services \nimproved in Asia and the Pacific DMCs (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2015.

Manila \n \n \n ", "3 \ncapacity of selected DMCs to implement best practices and innovative solutions in health systems \nenhanced.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Development of sovereign and nonsovereign health projects supported. \nThe TA will provide consultant support to ADB\u2019s operations departments, resident missions, and \ncountry offices to help with (i) the preparation of health sector assessments that will inform \ndiscussions  about  country  programming  and  country  partnership  strategies;  and  (ii)  the \ndevelopment of sovereign and nonsovereign health projects in at least five DMCs, which may \ninclude Bangladesh, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Solomon Islands, \nTonga, and Uzbekistan. However, additional DMCs may be supported based on consultations \nwith ADB\u2019s operations departments. Based on DMC baseline progress toward UHC and stated \npriorities, the TA could support the development and implementation of UHC strategies, plans, \npolicies,  or  programs  that  incorporate  TA-identified  UHC-related  best  practices,  innovative \ntechnologies (particularly e-health technologies), and/or quality infrastructure. \n \n10.  Output 2: Technical guidance on universal health coverage best practices and \ninnovative technologies in developing member countries provided. In close coordination \nwith ADB\u2019s operations departments, the TA will support the review of country-level health systems \nand health outcomes in at least five DMCs enumerated in output 1. Building on these reviews, a \nregional stocktaking exercise will be undertaken to identify gender-sensitive best practices and \ninnovative technologies to achieve UHC and address health system challenges in Asia and the \nPacific, while also considering the role of local governments in multilevel governance settings for \nhealth. The TA will synthesize lessons learned from country-level health reviews and will prepare \na set of technical guidance materials and a region-wide analytical report that will inform DMCs on \nincorporating and scaling up innovative technologies in national health plans, policies, and \nprograms to achieve UHC. Regular consultations with the operations department health staff will \nalso be held to gather intelligence on the health sector needs expressed by governments, and \nalso to regularly test the assumptions of the innovative technologies. In addition, non-health sector \ninterventions,  which  have  been  sustainably  leveraged  to  improve  health  outcomes,  will  be \nidentified,  their  health  benefits  will  be  quantified,  and  future  opportunities  for  multisector \nengagement will be promoted. \n \n11.  Output 3: Knowledge on universal health coverage best practices for improved \nhealth outcomes expanded. This TA will support a series of knowledge events that will include \nonline information exchange, the development of a network of consultants that countries and ADB \nofficials can call upon to support health-related activities, and linkages with academic institutions \nto support operational research. These consultants will be organized by expertise and geographic \nregion to provide timely, locally relevant expert support to DMCs in the design and implementation \nof UHC programs. Knowledge events will be held for DMC officials, development partners, and \nother stakeholders to disseminate and validate the review findings; share technical guidance \nmaterials; and identify priority health-related targets, capacity needs, and follow-up actions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n                                                \n7  The design and monitoring framework is available in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "4 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. In close coordination with \nADB\u2019s operations departments, the Health Sector Group Secretariat (HSGS), under the Sector \nAdvisory Service Cluster of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department, \nwill  implement  the  TA  and  be  accountable  for  the  outputs.  The  HSGS  will  carry  out  TA \nadministration, supervision, implementation oversight, and communication with consultants and \nstakeholders in close collaboration with the operations departments and other sector and thematic \ngroups.  In  particular,  the  HSGS  will  work  closely  with  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  in  the \nrecruitment and management of national consultants. The HSGS will coordinate with ADB\u2019s \noperations departments, resident missions, Private Sector Operations Department, and Office of \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership on the use of the available TA resources. \n \n14.

Individual  national \nconsultants who are technical experts in priority areas (e.g., e-health, nutrition, and health \nfinancing) with intimate familiarity with their respective country context will conduct country-level \nhealth system analyses. They will work with three international consultants, each covering a \ndifferent area of expertise: (i) health economics, (ii) health systems and e-health, and (iii) technical \nwriting.8 The  consultants  will  document  best  practices,  stocktaking,  lessons  learned,  and \nguidance for implementing health projects to work toward achieving UHC across the region. The \ninternational consultant on health economics and the international consultant on health systems \nand e-health will be contracted for 16 person months each, while the international consultant on \ntechnical writing will be contracted for 4 person months. Each of the five national consultants will \nbe engaged for 18 person months each. There will be total of 36 person months of international \nconsultant inputs and 90 person months of national consultant inputs. After the completion of the \nknowledge products, DMC officials and other stakeholders will be invited to participate in a series \nof  capacity  building  events,  which  will  promote  the  sharing  of  lessons  learned  and  new \nopportunities while also building capacity to design and implement effective programs across the \nregion. \n                                                \n8  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \n \nIV.
