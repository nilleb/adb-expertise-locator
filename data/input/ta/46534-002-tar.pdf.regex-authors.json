INTRODUCTION \n1.        Disbursement is a vital part of the project cycle, and a key indicator in measuring the \nsuccess  of  project  implementation  and resource  transfers to  developing member  countries \n(DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). ADB\u2019s Controller's Department (CTL) has been \nproviding capacity development seminars on disbursement for DMCs since 1990. CTL plays a \ncritical  role  in  ensuring  that  disbursement  transactions  are  processed  efficiently  and  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines. CTL also provides guidance and support to \nexecuting agencies, implementing agencies, and ADB staff on disbursement-related policies \nand procedures during project implementation. \n \n2.       The  disbursement  seminars  have  been  conducted  for  staff  of  executing  agencies, \nimplementing agencies, finance ministries, and supreme audit institutions (SAIs). They focus on \nenhancing the understanding of executing and implementing agencies on the application of \nADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures  and  support the  resolution  of  disbursement-related  issues \nfaced by executing and implementing agencies in their respective projects. \n \n3.     This technical assistance (TA) will continue ADB\u2019s efforts to strengthen the institutional \ncapacity of DMCs and related agencies to further improve the use of loan,1 grant, and TA funds. \nIn addition to supporting seminars on loan disbursement, this TA will support seminars on TA \ndisbursement and promotion of the client portal for disbursements (CPD). The CPD will enable \nDMCs  to  prepare  and  submit  online  withdrawal  applications.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.       Many executing and implementing agencies lack capacity for, and an understanding of \nor  previous  experience  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  and  TA  disbursement  procedures.  This  causes \nsubmission  of  substandard  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB,  which  in  turn  creates  an \nunnecessary administrative burden on the executing and implementing agencies, and ADB. It \nhinders the timely transfer of loan funds to DMCs and the successful implementation of projects. \n \n5.       Based on CTL\u2019s experience, institutional capacity issues can be attributed to various \nreasons.  One  common  issue  is  the  high  turnover  of  experienced  project  staff  handling \ndisbursement.  The  staff  concerned  move  to  the  private  sector  for  opportunities  that  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies cannot match. As long as the turnover is an ongoing \nissue, the gap in institutional capacity continues. This gap is filled by new staff who have limited \nor no experience with ADB disbursement procedures. Such skills and knowledge gaps often \ncontribute to problems encountered during project implementation. Without provision of timely \nintervention measures such as regular and proactive capacity development on disbursement \nprocedures, lack of institutional capacity is expected to hamper project implementation. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.       The impact will be greater mobilization of loan, and TA funds to DMC governments and \nrecipients.  The  outcome  will  be  staff  at  executing  and  implementing  agencies  with  more \n                                                \n1  For the purpose of this document, loan also means grant unless otherwise specified. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 June 2015. \n ", "2  \nknowledge of ADB policies and procedures and the technical capabilities for project financial \nadministration and use of the CPD system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.       It is expected that 30 seminars, workshops, and trainings will be conducted during the \nTA period. An estimated 900 participants will attend\u2014(i) finance and accounting staff of the \nexecuting and implementing agencies directly involved in disbursement, and (ii) representatives \nfrom finance ministries and SAIs. \n8.  The seminars will cover topics such as: \n \n(i)  loan and TA products and features; \n(ii)  disbursement policies and procedures; \n(iii)   country- and project-specific case studies and group discussions; \n(iv)  preparation, submission, and monitoring of loan withdrawal applications and TA \nc laims; \n(v)  p  roject accounting and monitoring compliance; \n(vi)  g( overnment counterpart fund contributions and accounting systems; \n(vii)  general audit issues for ADB projects in the DMC concerned; and \n(viii)  CPD features and procedures. \n \n9.       ADB will coordinate closely with borrowers and recipients on seminar arrangements for \neffective implementation. Such coordination will help mitigate the risks mentioned in the design \nand monitoring framework. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.       The TA is estimated to cost $300,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.      ADB will be the executing agency and will implement the TA. The expected starting date \nis July 2015, the expected completion date is June 2017. TA proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n12.      CTL will oversee TA activities and provide direct inputs to activities. ADB\u2019s resident \nmissions will provide support on seminar delivery (for resident missions with disbursement units), \nmission concurrence, workshop schedules, and coordination with DMC governments on the \nnomination of participants. \n \n13.      No consultants will be engaged under the TA. The resource speakers will come from \nCTL and resident missions. Additional resource speakers will be invited from finance ministries \nand government agencies. Staff from SAIs will be invited, as needed, to present general audit \nfindings and issues from the audit of ADB\u2019s project financial statements. \n \n14.      The seminars will last 2 days on average. Longer seminars may be held depending on \nthe needs of the DMC concerned and in consultation with CTL. On average, 40\u201350 participants \nare expected to attend each seminar to allow effective participation and facilitate knowledge \n ", "  3\nsharing. Seminars may be held more than once a year in a given DMC based on geographical \nlocation and spread, and number of participants. While the training program on loan and TA \ndisbursements is the key TA output, it is expected that it will also help participants to gain a \nbetter understanding of the CPD system. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nDisbursement Seminars for Developing Member Countries, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nImpact the technical assistance is aligned with: \nImproved mobilization of loan, grant, and technical assistance funds to DMC government and recipients. \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nStaff at executing and  Percentage of participants  Disbursement mission  Lack of commitment \nimplementing  satisfied with the relevance  from participants \nagencies have more  and usefulness of the \nRelevant participants \nknowledge of ADB  seminar \nare not invited or are \npolicies and \nNumber of executing and  Back-to-office report  unable to attend \nprocedures and the \nimplementing agencies    \ntechnical capabilities  Inadequate information \nsuccessfully using the   \nfor project financial  technology \nclient portal for  Feedback documents \nadministration and  infrastructure of the \ndisbursements   and evaluation reports \nuse of the client  executing and \nportal for      implementing agencies \ndisbursements \nOutput       \nTraining program  30 seminars or workshops  Seminar, workshop, and  Relevant staff not \ndesigned  for  or training sessions  training session  invited \nparticipating DMCs  delivered  attendance \nLack of commitment \nBack-to-office report  from participants \n \n  Feedback documents \n   \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.
