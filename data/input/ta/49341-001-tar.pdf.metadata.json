Over time, these measures have the potential to \nsignificantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure in Viet Nam.  \n \n3.  The legal framework for the country's PFM system is being further improved. In 2015, \nthe National Assembly is expected to approve the Law on Accounting, and a new draft Law on \nPublic Asset Management (PAML) will be submitted for consideration in 2016. The latter has \nimportant implications for budget formulation (both recurrent and investment components) and \nimportant linkages to all of the other elements of the PFM system, with the management of \npublic assets being better integrated with financial management information systems. \n \n4.  Priority  assistance  needs.  In  light  of  recently  passed  and  forthcoming  legislative \ninitiatives, the Government is faced with significant implementation challenges. An important \nnumber of decrees and circulars are needed to clarify how the high-level principles of the PIL, \nSBL and the upcoming PAML will be put to work. Significant capacity development and training \nis also required at national, provincial government levels to ensure officials are fully aware of, \nand able to implement, new requirements. Extensive consultations with the MOF, Ministry of \nPlanning  and  Investment  (MPI),  the  National  Assembly\u2019s  Committee  for  Financial  and \nBudgetary Affairs (CFBA), as well as other development partners already active in PFM1 have \nidentified three priorities for immediate support, (i) Provincial Government debt management, \n(ii) public asset management, and (iii) Parliamentary budget oversight.  \n \n5.  A major component of SBL (2015) reform is to grant all 63 provincial (and two first class \ncity) governments the power to run fiscal deficits and to mobilize debt to finance these deficits \nsubject to prescribed debt burden ceiling limits. Over time, significant regulatory and analytical \nwork  is  required  to  develop  the  capacity  of  these  authorities  to  undertake  these  new \nresponsibilities  in  an  efficient  manner.  More  immediately  however  the  MOF  Banking  and \nFinancial Institutions Department (BFID), which is jointly responsible with the Department of \nDebt Management and External Finance for sub-national debt mobilization and management \nhave requested assistance for the completion of an assessment of the compatibility of existing \nfinancial management information system requirements to adequately monitor Provincial debt \nmobilization.2 This review is vital to ensure national government can maintain an adequate \noversight on Provincial debt mobilization and management following the commencement of \nSBL (2015) on 1st January 2017. The review is also expected to contribute to the design of a \nmore substantial program of technical and capacity support to be undertaken directly with \nProvincial Governments in support of these reforms. \n \n6.  The revised PAML is expected to introduce modern concepts and approaches to public \nasset management in Viet Nam. To implement these principles however will require the drafting \nof a large number of supporting Decrees to guide the implementation of the Law at the sector \nlevel.  The  draft  law  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to  Government  in  mid-2016,  with \n                                                \n1 This includes the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the European Union (EU), \nGermany\u2019s Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the World Bank. \n2 Through the ongoing Financial Sector Deepening program (44251-013) ADB will also be provide complementary \nsupport to the BFID for the preparation of a manual on municipal bond issuance that supports the implementation of \nCircular 100/2015/TT-BTC on the topic. The BFI will also receive support for the drafting of a new circular which will \nregulate additional debt raising modalities for sub-national governments, including access to direct credit from \ncommercial banks. This will include the provision of advisory assistance on the regulatory framework for local \ngovernment borrowing, but also with the preparation of an associated implementation manual.  ", "  3 \nimplementation commencing in 2018. The Ministry of Finance Public Assets Management \nDepartment (PAMD) has requested ADB technical assistance to assist in the preparation of \nassociated Decrees that will guide the implementation of the revised PAML, paying particular \nattention to the future management of state infrastructure assets. Initially this will include the \npreparation of Decrees on metro and rail asset management however this is expected to lead \nto a larger program of work looking at other infrastructure sub-sectors such as roads, ports, \nairports and power assets. The draft PAML and its associated decrees will also require the \nimplementation  of  a  modern  information  management  system  for  strategic  public  asset \nmanagement. This will include the development of a complete national database of assets \n(domestic and ODA funded), and the effective link of the system to other elements of the public \nfinancial management information systems. In this context, the PAMD has requested an initial \nassessment of the system functionalities that will be required for the implementation of the \nprovisions of the law lined to strategic public asset management.  Future assistance in this area \nwill likely be targeted at the implementation of the recommendations offered by this technical \nreview.  \n \n7.  The SBL (2015) endows the National Assembly with enhanced authorities over budget \napproval and oversight. These new authorities extend to the approval of government bonds \n(previously off-budget) and budget norms (on recurrent and capital expenditure). In light of \nthese  new  demands,  the  National  Assembly\u2019s  CFBA  has  requested  assistance  for  the \npreparation of a manual for new National Assembly members and officials that clarifies and \nprovides guidance on the general and new requirements that the SBL poses on the role of the \nNational Assembly. This manual will be an important component of the National Assembly\u2019s \nefforts to understand and enforce SBL (2015) requirements as well as to update the knowledge \nof budget-related Commissions of Provincial People\u2019s Councils (PPC\u2019s). Looking forward, and \nthis initial technical input is also expected to contribute to the design of a larger capacity \nsupport program with the National Assembly and the PPC\u2019s to enhance their overall ability to \nimplement SBL (2015) requirements.  \n \nC.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA is aligned with the Ministry of Finance\u2019s Finance Sector Strategy \n(2011-2020)1  goal  to  strengthen  the  efficiency  and  accountability  of  public  financial \nmanagement  systems  in  Viet  Nam.  The  Outcome  of  the  SSTA  will  be  to  enhance  the \nGovernment\u2019s knowledge and implementation capacity in selected PFM reform areas. \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will have four Outputs: (i) assessment of financial management information \nsystem  requirements  for  monitoring  of  debt  mobilization  of  sub-national  governments \ncompleted;  (ii)  drafting  of  Decree  on  Infrastructure  Asset  Management  facilitated;  (iii) \nassessment on information system requirements for public asset management prepared; and \n(iv) manual on National Budget oversight functions of the National Assembly, following SBL \n(2015), drafted.  \n \n10.  TA  activities  will  include  a  mix  of:  a)  direct  advisory  assistance  through  a  mix  of \ninternational  and  national  consultants;  and  b)  capacity  development  activities  (including \n                                                \n1 The Ministry of Finance, Viet Nam. 2012. Finance Sector Strategy 2011-2020. ", "  4 \nspecialized workshops on best international practices, new legislation dissemination seminars, \ntraining events, etc.). Final design and implementation of TA activities will use a consultative \napproach  where  all  relevant  stakeholders  will  be  involved,  including  national  and  local \ngovernment agencies, development partners, and private sector among others. \n \n11.  In light of the clear links of the proposed activities to other elements of the ADB portfolio \n(road and metro projects for instance), the TA will seek input from relevant ADB officers in \ninforming the design of activities, including the definition of detailed terms of reference of \nconsultants, commentary on draft reports, etc.   \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n   \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $225,000 and will be funded on a grant basis \nfrom  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in \nAttachment 1. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency and the Vietnam Resident Mission (VRM) within the \nSoutheast  Asia  Department  will  be  the  focal  point.  VRM  will  work  closely  with  the  MoF \nDepartments  of  Banking  and  Financial  Institutions,  Public  Asset  Management,  and  Debt \nManagement  and  External  Finance;  and  with  the  National  Assembly\u2019s  CFBA  in  the \nimplementation of activities.

The TA \nwill commence on 1 November 2015 and will be completed on 30 September 2016. The \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference are attached as Appendix 4. \n \n5.  Preliminary Risk Assessment \n \n19.  Overall, risk is considered low, as the TA will be limited to direct advisory services for the \ndevelopment of regulatory instruments for public financial management, and the organization of \ncapacity development activities. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment have shown full support to the proposed TA and to the development of a medium-\nterm  program  of  assistance  from  ADB  to  public  financial  management  reforms,  including \nadditional TA and policy-based lending. \n \nD.
