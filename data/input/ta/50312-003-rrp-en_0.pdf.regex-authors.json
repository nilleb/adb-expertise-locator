THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Railway Rolling Stock Operations Improvement \nProject. The report also describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be \nprovided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund (ACEF)1 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility (CEFPF) for the Railway Rolling Stock Operations Improvement Project and, if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  proposed  a  project  for  financing  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to improve the operational efficiency of the Bangladesh Railway \nthrough the procurement of modern rolling stock, prepare investment projects to enhance its \nrolling stock maintenance capacity and support the ongoing railway reform. The project will \ncontribute to an increase in the share of the railway as a core mode of transportation and to the \nshift from roads to rail. This modal shift and the efficient rolling stock will reduce carbon dioxide \n(CO ) emission. \n2\n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Transport  sector  overview.  The  Bangladeshi  transport  system  consists  of  roads, \nrailways, inland waterways, seaports for maritime shipping, and civil aviation facilities that cater \nto both domestic and international traffic. Historically, the railway enjoyed a monopoly as a carrier \nand transported most principal commodities, including cement, coal, fertilizer, raw jute, stone, \nfood grain, and sugar cane. However, the railway began losing market share, declining from 30% \nin 1975 to a mere 4% in 2015 for both passenger and freight transports. By 2015, road transport \nhad become dominant, carrying over 70% of passenger traffic and 60% of freight traffic.2 The drop \nin the market share of the railway as a carrier is the result of the long-term inadequate investment \nin  railway  infrastructure  and  operational  improvement  of  Bangladesh  Railway,  causing \ninconvenient and unreliable operations and uncomfortable experiences for passengers. \n \n4.  Railway  as  a  sustainable  transport  system.  While  there  has  been  significant \nunderinvestment  in  the  railway  infrastructure,  road  infrastructure  has  received  significant \ninvestment. This is because the initial cost of investment in the road infrastructure per kilometer \n(km) is generally lower than in the railway infrastructure.3 However, once demands exceed the \nexisting road capacity, expansions tend to be financially and socially costly, especially in densely \npopulated areas owing to land acquisition and resettlement requirements. The government \nrecognizes the virtues of the railway as a cheaper, safer, and fuel-efficient transportation mode. \nIt has the potential for greater speed and the capacity to provide demand-responsive sustainable \ndevelopment along core economic corridors without taking much land area if properly planned \nand developed. In its Seventh Five-Year Plan, fiscal year (FY) 2016\u2013FY2020, the government \nplaced special emphasis on railway development and set targets to increase railway market share \nfrom 4% to 15% in freight transport, from 10% to 15% in container transport between Dhaka and \nChittagong  Port,  and  from  4%  to  10%  in  passenger  transport  by  2020  through  prioritized \ninvestment in railway infrastructure (footnote 2). \n \n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015. Seventh Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020. Dhaka. \n3  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. ", "2 \n5.  Network capacity insufficient for traffic demands. Network capacity augmentation \nprogress has been marginal. Since 2006, only about 120 track km (about 3%) have been added \nto the network. In its Seventh Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020 (footnote 2), the government \ntargets the construction of 856 km of new rail tracks, expediting efforts to augment the capacity \nof the railway network. Additional fleets are required for use in the enhanced network. \n \n6.  Rolling stock unavailable for efficient operations. An adequate number of effective \nrolling stock should be available for efficient railway operations. Bangladesh Railway had 278 \ndiesel locomotives, 1,249 coaching vehicles, and 8,677 freight wagons at the end of FY2016.4 \nHowever, majority of rolling stock are aged over 30 years, most of which exceeds their economic \nlives. The old rolling stock is no longer reliable to operate, experiencing frequent malfunctions. In \nthe course of revising its master plan, Bangladesh Railway identified the need to procure 197 \nlocomotives, 1,492 coaches, and 2,202 wagons by 2025.5 \n \n7.  Inadequate  conditions  of  rolling  stock  maintenance  facilities.  The  maintenance \nfacilities of Bangladesh Railway have not been improved as required over time. Bangladesh \nRailway owns four maintenance workshops and 10 maintenance sheds for locomotives, and two \nmaintenance workshops and 14 maintenance depots for coaches and wagons. These facilities \nare not adequately equipped with the necessary machinery, maintenance parts, and staff, and \nare unable to attend to the prescribed maintenance cycles of rolling stock. A significant number \nof special repair needs\u2014owing to frequent breakdowns of timeworn rolling stock\u2014is an added \nburden to these maintenance facilities, further hampering timely and quality maintenance. While \nBangladesh Railway realizes the urgent need for enhancing maintenance facilities, it lacks the \ninstitutional knowledge to prepare investment projects for such purpose.  \n \n8.  Reform needs of the Bangladesh Railway. Sound financial performance is a key to \nsustainable  railway  operations,  but  the  performance  of  Bangladesh  Railway  has  not  been \nencouraging. Its average operating ratio (operating expenses divided by operating revenues) \nbetween FY2007 and FY2016 is 214%, showing operating cost is about double the operating \nrevenue. The government has provided sufficient subsidies for Bangladesh Railway to sustain its \noperations and railway reform has been in progress to foster the Bangladesh Railway as a robust \ngoing concern. A major cause of Bangladesh Railway\u2019s unsatisfactory revenue performance has \nbeen the historically low level of passenger and freight tariffs, which had been frozen by the \ngovernment for decades. Increases both in the railway network capacity and in the number of \noperational rolling stock will generate more revenues through capturing the market demand \nsuppressed by capacity constraints. While the timely consolidation of accurate management \ninformation  and  preparation  of  precise  financial  statements  are  prerequisites  for  effective \nbusiness planning, Bangladesh Railway lacks the required tools and resources for this. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s assistance to Bangladesh Railway. ADB has been engaged with Bangladesh \nRailway to support the government initiatives to develop the railway as a sustainable transport \nsystem of the country. Since 2006 and starting with the Railway Sector Investment Program, ADB \nhas provided four loans to the government with the total amount of $2,811 million.6 The three \npillars  of  ADB\u2019s  support  have  been  network  capacity  improvement,  operational  capacity \nimprovement, and railway reform implementation. \n                                                \n4  Bangladesh Railway. 2017.

Manila. \n ", "3 \n \n10.  Network capacity improvement. ADB has provided three loans to invest in network \ncapacity enhancement since 2006. ADB\u2019s Railway Sector Investment Program (footnote 6) \nfinanced the double tracking of the 64 km Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar section of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \ncorridor, and the extension of loop lines and modernization of signaling in the Ishurdi\u2013Darsana \nsection. In 2014, ADB approved the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Railway \nConnectivity: Akhaura\u2013Laksam Double Track Project to upgrade the 72-km section of the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong corridor to a double track railway line with modern signaling equipment.7 In 2016, ADB \napproved the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar Railway \nProject Phase 1, to construct the 102-km section of the Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar railway corridor.8 \n \n11.  Operational capacity improvement. To improve the quality of its rolling stock assets, \nsince 2006, Bangladesh Railway has procured 46 locomotives, 269 coaching vehicles, and 645 \nfreight wagons. This includes the procurement of 150 passenger carriages under the ADB-\nsupported Railway Sector Investment Program (footnote 6). The procurement of 264 passenger \ncarriages, 10 locomotives, and additional maintenance equipment is ongoing under the ADB-\nsupported Railway Rolling Stock Project, approved in 2015. The project completion is expected \nin 2020 as planned.9 Furthermore, procurement of 70 locomotives and 270 passenger carriages \nis ongoing under the Bangladesh Railway\u2019s own budget to replace the oldest rolling stock. \n \n12.  Railway reform implementation. The Railway Reform Project under ADB\u2019s Railway \nSector  Investment  Program  (footnote  6)  has  supported  the  improvement  of  the  financial \nperformance of Bangladesh Railway. It contributed to the realization of the passenger and freight \ntariff adjustment in FY2013, for the first time since 1992, and the establishment of tariff adjustment \nformula allowing annual tariff adjustments by the Ministry of Railways. The first tariff adjustment \nbased on this formula was made in February 2016, and the continued annual tariff adjustments \nare expected to gradually raise the operating revenue. The focus of the operating cost reduction \nis on the maintenance cost, representing 32.16%, and the fuel cost, representing 16.23% of total \noperating  expenses  in  FY2016.  Replacement  of  timeworn  rolling  stock  and  improved \nmaintenance facilities will reduce the unit cost of rolling stock maintenance. The introduction of \nmodern fuel-efficient locomotives will bring down the fuel cost of each train. For the preparation \nof timely and accurate management information and precise financial statements, the Railway \nReform  Project  supported  the  development  of  an  enterprise  resource  planning  information \ntechnology (ERPIT) system. The railway reform agenda are being implemented consistently to \nachieve the self-sustainable operations of Bangladesh Railway.10 \n \n13.  Consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy.  To  promote  economic \ndiversification and enhance the economy\u2019s long-term growth potential, ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020,  emphasizes  the  importance  of  easing  infrastructure \nconstraints by undertaking transformational investments and promoting policy reforms in key \nsectors such as energy, transport, and urban development as a priority investment area.11 ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s previous interventions in Bangladesh Railway have often faced \nstart-up  delays  in  project  implementation.  The  main  cause  of  delays  for  the  rolling  stock \nimprovement  projects  has  been  in  the  procurement  process  of  the  suppliers.  During  the \npreparation of the project, ADB has supported the early preparation of bidding documents with \nnonrestrictive technical specifications and unambiguous technical evaluation criteria to facilitate \nthe bidding process. Furthermore, with the continued loan assistance for Bangladesh Railway \nprojects since 2006, Bangladesh Railway has gradually gained the institutional knowledge for \nproject implementation. This has enabled the establishment of a project implementation unit \nstaffed with officials experienced in ADB projects. \n \n15.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB assistance in rolling stock will increase the \noperational capacity of Bangladesh Railway. The rolling stock to be procured under the project \nwill include 40 locomotives equipped with auxiliary power unit (APU), which will be introduced for \nthe  first  time  into  the  Bangladesh  Railway.  APU  will  significantly  reduce  the  diesel  fuel \nconsumption of locomotives during idling time. The effect of APU has been proven internationally \nand, in the case of the Indian Railways in India, a neighboring country of Bangladesh, APU \nconsumed about 85% less diesel fuel per hour than the main engine did during idling time. The \nfuel cost savings will contribute to the improvement of the financial performance of Bangladesh \nRailway and the reduction of CO  emission. The attached TA to be financed by the ACEF (footnote \n2\n1) under the CEFPF will further enhance the effects of the new technology by improving the \ncapacity of Bangladesh Railway staff on the energy-efficient rolling stock operations, including \nthe use of APU-equipped locomotives. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) a balanced 3R (rail, river, and road)- \nbased multimodal transport infrastructure system developed (footnote 2), and (ii) greenhouse gas \nemissions in the power, transport, and industry sectors reduced.13 The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: operational and energy efficiency of Bangladesh Railway improved.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  Output 1: Modern rolling stock procured. The project will procure 40 broad gauge \nlocomotives, 125 luggage vans for passenger and parcel trains, and 1,000 wagons for freight \ntrains for use in the major corridors of the Bangladesh Railway network. \n \n18.  Output 2: Investment plans for maintenance facilities of locomotives and diesel \nelectric multiple units developed. The consulting services under the project will prepare \ninvestment plans of urgently required maintenance facilities (feasibility studies, detailed designs, \ncost estimates, and bidding documents). \n \n19.  Output 3: Capacity of Bangladesh Railway officials and locomotive drivers on \nenergy-efficient  rolling  stock  operations  improved.  The  project  will  establish  a  training \nprogram  and  train  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  locomotive  drivers  on  the  effective  use  of  new \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2016.

Output 4: Enterprise resource planning information technology system for accrual \naccounting used and adequately maintained. A team of information technology (IT) engineers \nwill be engaged under the project to (i) provide daily operational support to the users of the ERPIT \nsystem, and (ii) operate and maintain the ERPIT system and its infrastructure developed under \nADB\u2019s Railway Sector Investment Program (footnote 6). Bangladesh Railway intends to establish \nan IT cell to operate and maintain the system. The support of IT engineers under the project will \ncontinue for 3 years to bridge the gap until a fully staffed IT cell is established in Bangladesh \nRailway. \n \nD.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n27.  In principle, APU will be kicked in automatically in accordance with preset parameters, but \nit requires appropriate operation by locomotive drivers to realize its full potential. While there is \nno precedent use of APU in Bangladesh, an assessment by Indian Railways, for instance, \n ", "7 \nindicates that only 43% of potential APU operation hours are utilized due to inadequate operations \nby locomotive drivers. Because of their lack of confidence in this new unit, it is often observed \nthat locomotive drivers switch off APU to avoid unexpected failures in locomotive operations. The \nTA will provide training to locomotive drivers to maximize the usage of APU in accordance with \nthe supplier\u2019s operations manual. It will include the support for Bangladesh Railway to establish \nthe training program with the preparations of training materials based on which Bangladesh \nRailway will be able to train its locomotive drivers after the proposed project; keeping pace with \nthe increase in APU-equipped locomotives in the future. In addition, as a policy direction for \nBangladesh Railway\u2019s management, the TA will recommend potential solutions to improve the \noverall energy efficiency of rolling stock operations.16 \n \n28.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ACEF (footnote \n1) under the CEFPF and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. Bangladesh Railway \nwill be the executing agency for the TA, which will be implemented from January 2019 to October \n2019 with 22 person-months input (13 international, 9 national).  An international firm shall be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality: cost ratio of 90:10 \nand bio-data technical proposals will be used for this recruitment. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n29.  The project will finance the procurement of railway rolling stock in line with international \ndesign  standards.  The  technical  specifications  of  the  rolling  stock  have  been  prepared  in \nconformity with the Bangladesh Railway\u2019s network capacity. Rolling stock supply contracts will \ninclude  the  preparation  of  operation  and  maintenance  manuals.  The  detailed  designs  of \nlocomotive  maintenance  facilities  will  be  prepared  to  ensure  the  early  improvement  of \nmaintenance facilities for the sustainable maintenance of locomotives procured under the project. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n30.  Economic  analysis.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines by comparing lifecycle costs in with- and without- project cases, \nusing a 9% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria.17 \nThe project is expected to deliver significant benefits through savings in fuel, maintenance costs, \nand travel time resulting from increased reliability and improved operational efficiency, savings in \nvehicle operating costs from avoided road travel, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe EIRR of the project is estimated at 14.5%. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate \nthe economic viability of the project with the following adverse changes in costs and benefits: (i) \ncapital costs increased by 10%, (ii) benefits reduced by 10%, (iii) capital costs increased by 10% \nand benefits reduced by 10%, (iv) fuel savings decreased by 20%, (v) travel time savings reduced \nby 50%, and (vi) CO  emission reduction excluded from the benefits. In all scenarios, the EIRR of \n2\nthe project remains above 9%, demonstrating the project\u2019s robustness. The most sensitive factor \nwas a 50% reduction in travel time savings, which decreases the EIRR to 11.1%. \n \n31.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.18 The  project  is  estimated  to  reduce  operating  costs  and  generate \n                                                \n16 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n ", "8 \nrevenues by collecting passenger and freight charges through the procurement of new, efficient \nlocomotives and additional vans and wagons. The weighted average cost of capital of the project \nwas estimated at 1.81%. Based on the existing system-wide costs and revenues, and on the \nassumption that passenger and freight tariffs would increase annually at a real rate of 1.5%, the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  project  was  estimated  at  3.2%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nunderscores the need for continuous annual adjustments of railway tariffs and for achieving the \ntarget traffic volumes with the new rolling stock. The analysis also demonstrated that incremental \nrevenues  of the  project  remain  higher than  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs, \nimproving the overall operating ratio of Bangladesh Railway over the analysis period. \n \n32.  Financial sustainability. As the operating expenses of Bangladesh Railway between \nFY2007 and FY2016 have been consistently higher than its revenues, the government continues \nto provide adequate budgetary support to sustain operations and to fully finance the funding gap. \nIn light of the systemic importance of Bangladesh Railway, the continued budgetary support is \nreasonably expected. The project is considered as financially sustainable. \n \nC.  Governance \n33.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that \nBangladesh Railway has adequate capacity to undertake the financial management of ADB-\nfinanced projects. Bangladesh Railway has prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB \nprojects. It has knowledge of project financial accounting methods and ADB disbursement \nprocedures. Its staff have participated in workshops on financial management and sharing of good \npractices organized by ADB. Its capacity is being strengthened by mainstreaming the use of the \nERPIT system. The overall project financial management risk is moderate. \n \n34.  Procurement and anticorruption. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). ADB will review documents \nand submissions related to procurement in all major milestones prior to proceeding with the \nprocurement process. The assessment of the procurement capacity of Bangladesh Railway has \nconcluded that it has a reasonable capacity to undertake procurement activities under the project. \nA project implementation unit will be established under Bangladesh Railway and staffed by \nofficials adequately experienced in rolling stock procurement. ADB has engaged a consultant to \nassist  Bangladesh  Railway  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  bidding  process.  The  overall \nprocurement risk is moderate. \n \n35.  National procurement regulations have improved through the Public Procurement Act, \n2006, and through the related Public Procurement Rules (2008), with subsequent amendments \nand the establishment of the Central Procurement Technical Unit under the Implementation \nMonitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning. In October 2012, a National \nIntegrity Strategy (NIS) was approved and a National Integrity Advisory Committee was formed, \nchaired by the Prime Minister, to oversee the anticorruption activities and implement the strategy. \nNIS includes a road map for strengthening both the state and non-state accountability institutions \nto fight corruption and improve governance. Under NIS, all line ministries and key watchdog \ninstitutions have formed ethics committees and appointed focal points to implement corruption-\nprevention programs and actions. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and Bangladesh Railway. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n36.  The most important project beneficiaries are the train users, both passengers of all \nticketed classes and freight transportation users. Although not directly targeting the poor, the \nproject will support their mobility needs, since the railway remains an affordable, comfortable, and \nreliable mode of transport.  Women will particularly benefit from the project as prominent railway \nusers. Since 2014, ADB has engaged with Bangladesh Railway in proactively integrating gender \nequality and social inclusion elements in two ADB-financed projects.19 As part of the policy \ndialogue, opportunities to further engage with Bangladesh Railway on organizational aspects of \ngender mainstreaming will be explored, with the aim of instituting gender-related business \nprocesses and practices. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \n38.  Environment (category C). The project mainly involves the procurement of railway rolling \nstock that will operate on existing railway lines. The preparation of the design of the maintenance \nfacilities will include conducting environmental assessments. This has already been included in \nthe terms of reference of the consulting services. A review of environmental implications as \nrequired for environment category C projects has been carried out and its findings show that there \nwill be no adverse environmental impacts during project implementation. After the completion of \nthe project, a net benefit in CO  emission reductions is expected from the shift of passengers and \n2\nfreight from road to rail and the use of more energy-efficient locomotives equipped with APU. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project mainly involves the procurement of \nrailway rolling stock. The preparation of the design of the maintenance facilities will include \nconducting the due diligence of involuntary resettlement impacts. This has been included in the \nterms of reference of the consulting services. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project mainly involves the procurement of \nrailway rolling stock, and the preparation of the design of the maintenance facilities will include \nconducting due diligence of indigenous peoples impacts. This has been included in the terms of \nreference of the consulting services. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n41.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n                                                \n19 South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Railway Connectivity: Akhaura\u2013Laksam Double Track Project \n(footnote 7) and South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Chittagong-Cox\u2019s Bazar Railway Project, Phase 1 \n(footnote 8) are categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender action plans of these projects include \nmaking the stations friendly to elderly people, women, children, and people with disabilities; promoting rail crossing \nsafety  awareness  campaigns  to  communities  along  the  corridor,  focusing  on  pedestrians,  drivers,  parents, \nschoolchildren, and professional drivers; including personal safety and/or anti-sexual harassment protocol in stations; \nrunning a public, preventive awareness-raising campaign on sexually transmitted diseases and human trafficking; \nand taking proactive measures to support the rehabilitation of affected women. \n20 ADB.
