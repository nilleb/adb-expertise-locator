The Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund Institute\n(IMFI) have been collaborating to organize training courses on macroeconomic and structural\npolicies for officials of developing member countries (DMCs) that are in the process of\ntransition and economic reforms. Three training courses have been completed, the first in\nJanuary 1995 for the transitional economies of Southeast Asia, the second in April 1997 for\nSouth Asia, and the third for the Central Asian republics (CARs) covering Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, and Uzbekistan in June-July 1998. This technical assistance (TA) will finance the\nfourth training course on macroeconomic and structural policies for the Bank's five DMCs in\nCentral Asia, i.e. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan 1, and Uzbekistan and\nMongolia2.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The first collaborative course was based on the shared belief, borne out of\nexperience in assisting economies in transition, that proper understanding of the interplay\nbetween macroeconomic and sectoral issues - the specialized fields of the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank, respectively - was critical to sound management of the\neconomic transition. Therefore, a course was designed to update the knowledge of\ngovernment officials in conceptual and analytical issues relating to macroeconomic\nmanagement and structural policies. The first course was organized during 9-27 January 1995\nand brought together 24 officials from Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic,\nMyanmar, and Viet Nam. The second course was implemented for South Asia during 7-18\nApril 1997. Participants were 31 middle-level government officials from Bangladesh, Bhutan,\nIndia, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The third course was implemented for the\nCARs from 22 June to 10 July 1998, and was attended by 24 middle-level government officials\nfrom Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan.\n3. The courses were designed to capture the comparative strengths of the two\ncollaborating organizations, the demand management experience of IMF, and the Bank's\nknowledge of supply-side responses. Teaching responsibilities were shared between the two\norganizations, with IMFI concentrating on areas of macroeconomic variables, measurement,\nforecasting, and their interrelationships. The Bank focused on sector policy and institutional\nissues, and the types of structural reform and capacity building that are needed in economies\nadjusting and enhancing their market orientation. The feedback of participants from these\ncourses was positive.\n4. Major lessons learned from previous courses are that (i) the course should\ninclude topics relating to the economics of development, i.e., economic development during\ntransition, comparison of successful and unsuccessful transition economies, and analysis of\nprojections including sectoral development; (ii) topics should be specific to their economies'\npeculiarities and situation; (iii) macroeconomic and structural analysis should be strengthened\nby adding more economic methods, projections, and simultaneous analysis; and (iv)\ncoordination and support from the Bank's operations departments is an important factor for the\nsuccess of such courses.

The TA will take into consideration the\nsuggestions and lessons learned from the last three training courses, in particular, the third\ncourse.\n5. All CARs have experienced a prolonged economic contraction and/or\nmacroeconomic and structural problems following the breakdown of the former Soviet Union\n(FSU) in 1991. This is exacerbated by the impact of the Russian financial crisis. The Bank\nadopted an interim operational strategy in 1994 for Kazakhstan to facilitate its transition to a\nmarket economy. The strategy's objectives are to support the country's macroeconomic and\nsectoral policy reforms in close coordination with the World Bank and IMF, institutional\nstrengthening and human resource development, and support for selected infrastructure\nprojects. In 1996, Kazakhstan finally was able to halt its serious downward economic spiral.\nThe challenge now is to ensure sustainable growth, which will hinge on prudent\nmacroeconomic management and perseverance with structural reforms, both of which have\nbeen supported by IMF and the Bank through their lending instruments. The country's\nabsorptive capacity is limited by a difficult fiscal situation; low capacity for policy formulation\nand implementation; and little experience with the policies, procedures, and practices of\nexternal funding agencies. Training and capacity building are therefore recognized as key\ncomponents of most Bank projects.\n6. Uzbekistan also experienced serious economic and fiscal difficulties following\nthe collapse of the FSU and the loss of the Soviet centralized budgetary transfers.\nInternational trade and domestic production were disrupted resulting in high fiscal deficits, high\ninflation, and balance-of-payments difficulties. With the assistance of the Bank and the World\nBank, the country adopted a program for macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms,\nbut it decided to move slowly. The Bank adopted an interim country operational strategy for\nUzbekistan in September 1996 through which support is being provided for policy reforms,\ncapacity building, and institutional strengthening; and for sector-based investments to promote\neconomic growth.\n7. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic adopted a comprehensive program of\nmacroeconomic stabilization and structural reform measures in response to the sharp decline\nin gross domestic product (by about 50 percent from 1990 through 1995), high inflation, fiscal\ndeficits, and a virtual collapse of external trade. The Government strongly implemented the\nIMF's three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility that has now been completed. A\nsecond facility has now been provided to the Kyrgyz Republic. Economic recovery began in\n1995. Priority areas identified are enhancing the overall capacity of policymakers and\nexecuting agencies, implementing management of public finance, and reforming the\nagriculture and enterprise sectors. The Kyrgyz Republic is now regarded as the most reform-\noriented of the FSU countries and the first to join the World Trade Organization.\n8. Since Mongolia joined the Bank in 1991, Bank operations in the country have\ngrown steadily in volume and the number of sectors covered. The Bank is Mongolia's second\nlargest source of external assistance after Japan. Its 1997 economic performance reflects\nsuccessful implementation of a macroeconomic stabilization program that could mark the\nbeginning of a period of sustained noninflationary growth. The Government has successfully\nintroduced numerous reforms that are supporting the achievement of macroeconomic stability.\nStructural reforms undertaken are encouraging growth led by the private sector growth. The\ngovernment also recognizes that the transformation to a market-oriented economy requires\nnew skills that are not widely available in the present work force. The Bank has emerged as", "3\none of the major sources for institution and capacity building, which will continue to be a focus\nof future Bank operations in Mongolia.\n9. After independence in 1991, Tajikistan experienced an economic crisis due to\nthe combined effects of the breakup of the FSU and the civil war that followed. It is considered\none of the poorest countries in the world. Until its independence, Tajikistan was largely\ndependent on Moscow for financial resources. With the break-up of the FSU, Moscow's\nfinancial assistance ceased. Only in 1997 did the economy begin to recover in response to the\nGovernment's stabilization and structural reform program supported by the IMF and World\nBank. Tajikistan became a member of the Bank in April 1998. The Bank introduced an interim\noperational strategy aimed at guiding the Bank's initial assistance for Tajikistan to facilitate the\ncountry's transition to a market economy, assist in its post-conflict rehabilitation and\nreconstruction efforts, and provide support for natural disaster rehabilitation. In view of the\nGovernment's weak institutional capacity, the capacity-building efforts are considered an\nintegral component in Bank assistance.\n10. Overall, economic reforms in Turkmenistan have lagged behind the other\ntransition economies in Asia. It has not concluded a stabilization package with the IMF\n(negotiations started in 1991). The transition to a market-based economy is still in its initial\nstages, the economy is still centralized, and the institutional and legal basis for the transition\nhas not yet been established. (Turkmenistan is expected to become a member of the Bank in\nMarch 1999)\n11. Government officials of these countries need to enhance their knowledge base\nand skills in macroeconomic management and structural reforms. The experience of\nimplementing this course and responses received from participants confirm that countries\nundergoing economic reforms during their transition to market economies need considerable\nsupport for capacity building that will eventually strengthen their institutional capacities in these\nareas.\nIll.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n12. The main objectives of the TA are to strengthen the knowledge and capabilities\nof government officials in the CARs and Mongolia, to provide participants with an integrated\nunderstanding of issues that arise in managing growth with stability, and to highlight the roles\nplayed by the Bank and the IMF in this process. To achieve these goals, a course will be\nconducted to train officials from the Bank's Central Asian DMCs and Mongolia on\nmacroeconomic management with focus on financial programming and sector policy issues\nthat need to be addressed as these countries make the transition to market economies. The\ncourse will also provide an opportunity for the participants to learn about the policies, priorities,\nand working procedures of the Bank and IMF, and to learn from each other's experience. The\ncourse will thus facilitate long-term networking among participants and with resource\ninstitutions. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.", "4\nB.\t Scope\n13. The TA will provide training to about 30 middle to senior-level government\nofficials from Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and\nUzbekistan.\n14. The course design incorporates the feedback from the earlier courses, and the\nprevious experience of IMFI in training officials from the CARs. Consequently, the course\ncontent has been simplified and covers both concepts and methods, the pace of teaching has\nbeen slowed, simultaneous interpretation facilities will be provided, stress on experience\nsharing and interaction will be increased, and the sectoral focus will be selective.\n15. The three-week course will be conducted jointly by the staff of IMFI and the\nBank. The topics to be covered reflect the emerging sectoral priorities and concerns in the\nparticipating countries. The course will include (i) a stronger linkage between the\nmacroeconomic and structural policies; (ii) a session on the Asian Development Bank Institute\n(ADBI) covering its objectives, thrust, and research and training activities; 3 (iii) discussion of the\nAsian and Russian financial crises and their implications for CARs and Mongolia; and (iv)\ntopics on how to analyze external events and alleviate their adverse effects.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. IMFI will finance the travel and accommodation of its staff members, who will\nserve as resource persons. It will also cover the costs of preparing, translating, and printing the\ntraining materials. The Bank will meet all the other costs. The total cost to the Bank of the TA is\nestimated at $300,000 equivalent (Appendix 2). The TA will be financed by the Bank on a\ngrant basis from the Bank-funded TA program.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n17. The Bank and IMFI will jointly implement the TA. Within the Bank, the\nEconomics and Development Resource Center will implement the TA, in close cooperation\nwith the Programs Department (East). The detailed course program will be developed in\nconsultation with IMFI, Programs Department (East) and ADBI. The course methodology will\ninclude workshop sessions, case studies, and lectures. Participants will share country\nexperiences with each other. Major topics that the course will cover are listed in Appendix 3.\n18. Participants will come from finance and economic planning ministries and\ncentral banks. They are middle to senior-level officials involved in macroeconomic\nmanagement, national budget preparation, and economic policy reform and implementation.\nThe training course will be conducted for three weeks from 24 May 1999 at the Bank's\nheadquarters.\n19. Facilities for simultaneous interpretation will be provided, and the services of\nthree professional interpreters will be contracted. Lecture notes and background reading\nmaterials will be translated into Russian, as necessary, and provided to participants.

Three IMFI staff will lecture on the\nmacroeconomic aspects of the course while selected Bank staff will present topics on\nstructural policies, sector development, and the Bank's policies and procedures.

The transition to a market-based economy is still in its initial\nstages, the economy is still centralized, and the institutional and legal basis for the transition\nhas not yet been established. (Turkmenistan is expected to become a member of the Bank in\nMarch 1999)\n11. Government officials of these countries need to enhance their knowledge base\nand skills in macroeconomic management and structural reforms. The experience of\nimplementing this course and responses received from participants confirm that countries\nundergoing economic reforms during their transition to market economies need considerable\nsupport for capacity building that will eventually strengthen their institutional capacities in these\nareas.\nIll.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n12. The main objectives of the TA are to strengthen the knowledge and capabilities\nof government officials in the CARs and Mongolia, to provide participants with an integrated\nunderstanding of issues that arise in managing growth with stability, and to highlight the roles\nplayed by the Bank and the IMF in this process. To achieve these goals, a course will be\nconducted to train officials from the Bank's Central Asian DMCs and Mongolia on\nmacroeconomic management with focus on financial programming and sector policy issues\nthat need to be addressed as these countries make the transition to market economies. The\ncourse will also provide an opportunity for the participants to learn about the policies, priorities,\nand working procedures of the Bank and IMF, and to learn from each other's experience. The\ncourse will thus facilitate long-term networking among participants and with resource\ninstitutions. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.", "4\nB.\t Scope\n13. The TA will provide training to about 30 middle to senior-level government\nofficials from Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and\nUzbekistan.\n14. The course design incorporates the feedback from the earlier courses, and the\nprevious experience of IMFI in training officials from the CARs. Consequently, the course\ncontent has been simplified and covers both concepts and methods, the pace of teaching has\nbeen slowed, simultaneous interpretation facilities will be provided, stress on experience\nsharing and interaction will be increased, and the sectoral focus will be selective.\n15. The three-week course will be conducted jointly by the staff of IMFI and the\nBank. The topics to be covered reflect the emerging sectoral priorities and concerns in the\nparticipating countries. The course will include (i) a stronger linkage between the\nmacroeconomic and structural policies; (ii) a session on the Asian Development Bank Institute\n(ADBI) covering its objectives, thrust, and research and training activities; 3 (iii) discussion of the\nAsian and Russian financial crises and their implications for CARs and Mongolia; and (iv)\ntopics on how to analyze external events and alleviate their adverse effects.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. IMFI will finance the travel and accommodation of its staff members, who will\nserve as resource persons. It will also cover the costs of preparing, translating, and printing the\ntraining materials. The Bank will meet all the other costs. The total cost to the Bank of the TA is\nestimated at $300,000 equivalent (Appendix 2). The TA will be financed by the Bank on a\ngrant basis from the Bank-funded TA program.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n17. The Bank and IMFI will jointly implement the TA. Within the Bank, the\nEconomics and Development Resource Center will implement the TA, in close cooperation\nwith the Programs Department (East). The detailed course program will be developed in\nconsultation with IMFI, Programs Department (East) and ADBI. The course methodology will\ninclude workshop sessions, case studies, and lectures. Participants will share country\nexperiences with each other. Major topics that the course will cover are listed in Appendix 3.\n18. Participants will come from finance and economic planning ministries and\ncentral banks. They are middle to senior-level officials involved in macroeconomic\nmanagement, national budget preparation, and economic policy reform and implementation.\nThe training course will be conducted for three weeks from 24 May 1999 at the Bank's\nheadquarters.\n19. Facilities for simultaneous interpretation will be provided, and the services of\nthree professional interpreters will be contracted. Lecture notes and background reading\nmaterials will be translated into Russian, as necessary, and provided to participants. Two\nquestionnaires will be given to participants: a precourse questionnaire to elicit information\nabout their training needs and course expectations, and a postcourse questionnaire to assess\n3 ADB staff will introduce ADBI to the participants and collaborators such as IMFI.", "5\nthe effectiveness of the course in meeting these needs. Three IMFI staff will lecture on the\nmacroeconomic aspects of the course while selected Bank staff will present topics on\nstructural policies, sector development, and the Bank's policies and procedures. A research\nassistant will be engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nto assist Bank staff in researching and preparing suitable background materials for distribution\nto participants and providing support during the course implementation.
