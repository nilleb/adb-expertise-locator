THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The ensuing East to South Coast Road Connectivity Project (ESRCP) will support the \ngovernment of Timor-Leste\u2019s transport sector priorities to enhance connectivity to markets and \nservices and its social and national development agenda, through (i) rehabilitating and upgrading \nabout 173.7 kilometers (km) of national road sections in east and south coast areas, (ii) improving \nroad asset management, and (iii) strengthening awareness of road safety and gender-related \nissues. The ESRCP is estimated to cost $180.0 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nprovide financing in an amount equivalent to $110.0 million from its ordinary capital resources \nand $35.0 million from concessional loan. The government will finance $35.0 million including \ntaxes and duties.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the government to prepare \nand implement the ESRCP, particularly on: (i) safeguards analysis and documentation; and (ii) \ninstitutional and project management capacity development. The TA will supplement another \ntransaction TA facility (F-TRTA), the Southeast Asia Transport Project Preparatory Facility, which \nhas already been approved. The F-TRTA will support ESRCP through recruitment of (i) consulting \nfirm which will conduct the feasibility study and due diligence on engineering, economic and \nfinancial assessments, social and gender development, and procurement, and (ii) the individual \nconsultants who will conduct the tasks to meet the government\u2019s urgent needs (i.e. biodiversity \nspecialist, replacement cost and appraisal specialist, and procurement specialist).1 The individual \nconsultants under the proposed TA will fully coordinate the work with the consulting firm under \nthe F-TRTA. The proposed TA has been included in the country operations business plan for \nTimor-Leste, 2020\u20132022.2 \n \n3.  The proposed TA will recruit individual environmental and social safeguards consultants \nto undertake environmental and social safeguards studies to help the government prepare the \nESRCP. More specifically, the individual consultants will (i) conduct environmental safeguards \ndue diligence including preparation of environmental impact assessment or initial environment \nexamination; (ii) prepare climate change assessment, and (iii) undertake social safeguards due \ndiligence including preparation of the resettlement plan and the ethnic group development plan. \nFurther, the TA will recruit individual consultants to help develop the capacity of the government \nto implement the  ESRCP for  such  areas  as  (i)  livelihood  restoration  and  development,  (ii) \nindigenous peoples assessment, (iii) financial management and accounting, and (iv) overall \nproject management.  \n \n4.  For the output of safeguards analysis and documentation preparation for the ESRCP, the \nTA consultants will carry out (i) the due diligence for existing studies for Lautem\u2013Com and \nLautem\u2013Lospalos  road  sections,  and  (ii)  the  feasibility  study  for  Lospalos  \u2013Viqueque  and \nViqueque\u2013Natabora  road  sections  (Table  1).  The  government  has  prepared  initial  detailed \nengineering design (DED), and preliminary environmental and social safeguards studies for two \nroad sections (Lautem\u2013Com section and Lautem\u2013Lospalos section), which need further due \ndiligence and design review to make the project ready for ADB financing.

Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  Output 1: Safeguards analysis and documentation prepared.  The environmental and \nsocial  safeguards  studies  will  include  the  environmental  assessment,  poverty  and  social \nassessment, land acquisition and resettlement plan, stakeholder communication strategy, and \nconsultation  and  community  engagement  plans.  The  ESRCP  will  be  designed  taking  into \nconsideration  the  following:  climate  change  and  disaster  resilience,  sensitive  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards, gender mainstreaming, the need for paying attention to the ethnic \nminorities issues, obtaining broad community support of impacted ethnic minority communities \nand documentation of the same. \n \n6.   Output 2: Institutional capacity strengthened. The institutional capacity of relevant \nstaff under the Ministry of Public Works will be strengthened for such areas as (i) livelihood \nrestoration and development, (ii) indigenous peoples assessment, (iii) financial management and \naccounting, and (iv) overall project management. Capacity building needs will be assessed, \ntraining program and on-the-job training will be planned and conducted, and reporting including \nthe lessons learned will be prepared. Modalities of trainings and workshops will depend on the \ncoronavirus  disease  pandemic  situation.  If  limited  in-country,  face-to-face  trainings  for \ngovernment officials are not feasible, it will be conducted via online. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $ 1.0 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n1.  \n \n8.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, office supplies and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate the consultants, and procure goods. ADB will hire \nindividual consultants to provide the consultancy services to ensure integrated project delivery. \n \n ", "3 \nThe TA subproject include procurement of office equipment and furniture and materials for \nworkshops.
