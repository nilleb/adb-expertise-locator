INTRODUCTION \n1.  A key lesson from the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis is that strong local currency (LCY) \nbond markets are important for maintaining a better balance within finance sectors and for \nbuilding financial stability in the region. During the crisis, the currency risk exposure of the \nregion\u2019s companies whose liabilities were denominated in foreign currency could have been \nmitigated if there had been well-developed LCY bond markets and adequate bond market \ninformation flows. Since the crisis, the development of bond markets has become an important \npart  of  the  policy  reform  agenda  of  many  regional  governments,  prompting  a  number  of \ninitiatives  and  concrete  actions  to  facilitate  bond  market  development  subregionally  and \nregionally: (i) the Asian Bond Fund and Asian Bond Fund 2, established by the Executives\u2019 \nMeeting of East Asia\u2013Pacific Central Banks; (ii) the regional bond market development initiative \nof the Asia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation; and (iii) the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)+3.1 The AsianBondsOnline (ABO) website \nwas started under the ABMI in May 2004 with the support of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) aims to continue ADB support for disseminating and \nimproving the information flow for the region\u2019s bond markets.2  It is a continuation of three \nprevious TA projects designed and implemented to promote economic efficiency and enable \nmarkets through various information-dissemination activities and related knowledge products.3 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  East Asia\u2019s LCY bonds have emerged as a distinct asset class that showed great \nresilience during the recent global financial turmoil in 2008\u20132009 and as a key funding source \nfor  governments  and  domestic  companies  in  the  region.  Collective  regional  initiatives  and \ngovernment\u2019s national efforts have enabled bond markets to play a larger role in domestic \nfinancing in emerging East Asia.  \n \n4.  In  2008,  ASEAN+3  launched  a  new  ABMI  road  map  to  develop  liquid  and  well-\nfunctioning  bond  markets  and  effectively  channel  the  region\u2019s  abundant  savings  to  meet \nincreased investment needs. To make the new ABMI road map successful, it is essential to \nensure that issuers and investors can access an information network with accurate data and in-\ndepth analysis.  \n \n5.  Since the endorsement of the ABMI, LCY bond markets in emerging East Asia have \ncome  a  long  way.  They  have  expanded  significantly  in  recent  years,  driven  by  growth  in \ngovernment and corporate bond markets, with total outstanding bonds at well over $5 trillion at \nthe end of 2010. LCY bonds attract strong interest from domestic and foreign investors alike, \nboth seeking more data, information, and analysis toward making their portfolio choices. The \n                                                \n1  The ABMI  was endorsed at the meeting of the ASEAN+3 finance ministers in August 2003 to accelerate \ndevelopment of efficient and liquid bond markets in the region. ASEAN+3 comprises the 10 members of ASEAN \n(Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar,  the \nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam), plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, and \nJapan. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 August 2011. \n3  ADB. 2004. Grant Assistance for Asian Bonds Online Website. Manila (JFICT 9041, for $2,400,000, approved on \n16 January); ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Asian Bonds Online Website Project, Phase II. Manila (TA 6464-\nREG, for $900,000, approved on 24 June); and ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Asian Bonds Online Website \nProject, Phase III. Manila (TA 7539-REG, for $1,000,000, approved on 31 May). \n ", "2   \ndevelopment of bond markets in Asia requires that the flow of information, data, and analysis to \nglobal and regional investors be improved.  \n \n6.  Since  its  launch  in  May  2004,  the  ABO  website  has  progressed  from  being  an \ninformation site on LCY bond markets in the region to a one-stop clearinghouse providing data \nand analysis on LCY-denominated government and corporate bond markets in the region, as \nwell as information on their respective economic and legal environments, to key stakeholders \nsuch as institutional and retail investors, issuers, brokers, underwriting houses, policy makers, \nmarket regulators, and academics. A revamped ABO website was launched in April 2009 to \nreflect the priorities laid out in the new ABMI road map.  \n \n7.  In terms of content, the website includes (i) structural aspects of LCY bond markets in \nthe region (e.g., market infrastructure,4 rules and regulations,5 market activities,6 and market \ndata7), updates on ASEAN+3 ABMI activities, and a large number of progress indicators; (ii) \nresearch outputs (e.g., market analysis and policy research), news articles, and commentary on \nthe bond markets of each country in the region, as well as a knowledge center comprising a \nbond glossary, data releases, and a how-to-buy guide for bonds and bond funds; (iii) Market \nWatch, which is updated twice daily and provides the major market-priced variables and year-to-\ndate and month-to-date performance figures for each country;8 (iv) Credit Risk Watch, which \npresents, by region and by market, relevant and timely market data on the current global \nfinancial turmoil and provides a comprehensive view of the growing credit risk and volatility \nissues that affect Asian financial markets; and (v) information on new issuance9 and Islamic \nfinance.10 Asia Bond Monitor (ABM), a knowledge output that uses data and analysis from the \nABO  website,  has  advanced  from  semiannual  to  quarterly  publication,  which  marks  the \nexpansion of ABO analysis from the government sector into the corporate bond market. The \ncontent of ABM has been expanded to include a section on policy and regulatory developments, \nas well as individual market summaries for nine markets. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is a continuing project and study expected to expand the provision of information, \ndata, and analysis related to emerging Asian bond markets through the management of the \nABO website. This promotes monetary and financial cooperation and regional integration by \ndeveloping  robust  LCY  bond  markets  in  the  region.  The  TA  objective  is  to  contribute  to \ndeveloping robust LCY bond markets in line with the objectives of the new road map of the \nABMI.  The  TA  supports  the  expansion  and  creation  of  knowledge  products  by  expanding \ncoverage  of  the  region\u2019s  corporate  and  government  bond  markets.  It  aims  to  improve \n                                                \n4  Includes market overview; key market participants; exchange and trading platforms, registries, clearing, and \nsettlement; and ratings and rating agencies. \n5  Includes  supervisory  framework,  market  regulation,  securitization,  protection  of  investors,  and  investor \nparticipation. \n6  Includes instruments, bond identification, benchmark, reference rate, funding and hedging, indices, and street \nconventions.  \n7  Includes major issues, trading statistics, government auction calendar, and auction results. This section was \nexpanded in 2009 and 2010 to include issuance volume and foreign holdings in LCY bonds, disaggregated data on \nLCY bond market issuance, total bills-to-bonds ratio, and FCY bond issuance \n8  Market Watch is linked to Reuters, and the information is updated automatically.  \n9  This provides links to several sources of information on the new issuance of bonds in the region.    \n10 This section covers structural aspects such as (i) market infrastructure, (ii) rules and regulations, (iii) market \nactivities, (iv) market data, and (v) government polices and initiatives.    \n ", "  3 \ntransparency by providing (i) timely and relevant data and information to investors and (ii) \nunbiased analysis of LCY bond markets to facilitate cross-border investment in and demand for \nLCY-denominated bonds. \n \n9.  Key stakeholders\u2014institutional investors, issuers, policy makers, researchers, and other \nprivate sector participants\u2014access the ABO website\u2019s information, data, and analysis of various \nbond markets in Asia and download market indicators and the latest regional economic reports \nand related publications. The quarterly ABM, produced by ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic \nIntegration (OREI) and the ABO team, has emerged as a key analytical source for investors, \npolicy makers, and researchers. The table presents download statistics for the ABO website and \ncompares the first half of 2010 with the first half of 2011.  \n \nAsianBondsOnline Website Statistics \n1st Half 2010\u2013\n1st Half  2nd Half  1st Half  1st Half 2011 \nItem  2010  2010  2011  (% increase) \nHits  4,399,098  5,034,673  5,311,988  21.8 \nPage views  814,341  826,232  883,866  8.5 \nVisits  259,307  268,494  298,923  15.3 \nVisitors  33,346  38,211  43,404  30.2 \nWeekly debt highlights hits  26,899  38,544  51,457  91.3 \nAsia Bond Monitor hits  91,407  116,829  124,801  36.5 \nSource: AsianBondsOnline. \n \n10.  The ABO website is a public good that benefits all stakeholders. It improves information \nflows  related  to  bond  markets,  which  helps  make  bond  markets  more  transparent,  liquid, \nefficient, credible, and deep. ASEAN+3 has identified it as the key information and data source \nfor institutional investors on LCY bond markets in emerging East Asia. Reflecting consistently \npositive feedback and the contribution of the ABO website to developing regional bond markets, \nthe TA will explore expanding the coverage of domestic debt markets outside of ASEAN+3.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The components of the TA will include the following: \n(i)  Managing and upgrading the website. The TA will manage and upgrade the \ndesign and presentation of the ABO website, continuing to improve its usability \nand usage. \n(ii)  Expanding website content. The TA plans to enrich content by expanding the \ndatabase on corporate bonds to include maturity profiles and characteristics of \nthe top 30\u201350 corporate issuers in each market and providing (a) more detailed \ndata on investor holdings to support the bond investor survey; (b) more detailed \ndata on derivative products, including futures, interest rates and currency swaps, \nand hedging tools, among others; (c) a data set on the offshore renminbi market \nin Hong Kong, China that will be comparable to the existing data set for Hong \nKong dollar-denominated bonds; and (d) a market summary on Islamic finance \nthat will expand the data presented and be comparable to information available \non individual country bond markets. \n(iii)  Expanding  coverage.  The  aim  of  contributing  to  the  development  of  bond \nmarkets may extend to covering selected economies beyond ASEAN+3. Bond \n ", "4   \nmarkets in other subregions may still fall short of their potential and may benefit \nfrom inclusion on the ABO website and improved investor access to market \ninformation. \n(iv)  Developing a new data section on  banking. This new section will include \nbanking statistics and analysis of emerging Asian banking systems. It will be \nprimarily a study of individual banking systems that contrasts and compares their \nability to provide finance with that of the bond markets. \n(v)  Conducting the annual Asian local currency bond market investor survey \nin  2011  and  2012.  This  survey  will  provide  a  better  understanding  of \nintraregional bond investments and the different classes of investors holding LCY \nbonds, including the type and maturity profile of bonds held by different investors. \nThe importance of this survey is indicated by ABO\u2019s annual market liquidity \nsurveys  having  identified  the  lack  of  investor  diversity  as  the  factor  most \nconstraining liquidity. \n(vi)  Publishing Asia Bond Monitor and working papers. The TA will continue to \nproduce the quarterly  ABM, as well as policy briefs and working papers on \nimportant  issues  facing  the  region\u2019s  bond  markets.  The  ABO  is  involved  in \npreparing technical studies on special topics relating to financial markets (e.g., \nAsia\u2019s  non-deliverable forward  markets  and  liquidity  in  emerging  Asian  bond \nmarkets).  \n(vii)  Conducting other surveys. The annual ABO user survey and the annual Asian \nbond market liquidity survey will allow the ABO team to properly assess the \nwebsite\u2019s content and relevance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV). It is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.5 million. This amount will cover the \nremuneration  and  travel  expenses  of  international  and  national  consultants  and  resource \npersons, the expenses of organizing conferences and workshops, equipment and database \npurchases, report production, and miscellaneous expenses. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The OREI will implement the TA, in close \nconsultation with ASEAN+3 ABMI officials, and supervise the work of TA consultants. The TA is \nexpected to be completed in 18 months, from October 2011 to March 2013. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  require  50  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  225 \nperson-months of national, which will cost $1,150,000 including remuneration, travel, and per \ndiem. Individual consultants and resource persons will be hired according to ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Hiring a team of consultants \nwill provide more benefits to ADB than engaging a firm by allowing (i) faster mobilization of \nconsultants, (ii) greater control by ADB staff in selecting and managing individual consultants; \nand (iii) greater flexibility in engaging experts specializing in a broad spectrum of finance-related \ntopics. The project team leader and contract administration team will be drawn from OREI staff. \nOne international consultant, a bond market specialist, will help OREI supervise and coordinate \nthe  activities  of  each  expert  and  consolidate  individual  outputs.  The  other  international \nconsultants will be one economics editor, who will review and edit the contents of the ABO \nwebsite  and  related  publications;  bond market  economists,  who  will  evaluate  in  depth  the \n ", "  5 \ndevelopment of various bond markets; and financial market specialists, who will evaluate in \ndepth financial markets. About eight resource persons, recruited for a total of 2 person-months, \nwill be invited to participate in seminars as speakers and discussants. \n \n15.  The TA requires the following national consultants to operate and develop the ABO \nwebsite: one project coordinator and researcher to coordinate outputs and conduct research \nwith financial analysts; a senior analyst to provide in-depth analyses, draft working papers, and \ncontribute  to  publications;  and  six  financial  market  analysts,  each  with  country-specific \nassignments, who will monitor and analyze capital markets and policy issues in participating \ncountries and assist in supervising the ABO website\u2019s operation. One  website administrator and \ntwo web specialists are needed for system and database development and maintenance. One \nnational consultant will be engaged for graphics and design, and two other consultants for \ntypesetting  and  publication  layout.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n16.  Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment (e.g., computer \nhardware and software) and statistical databases will be purchased in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and,  where  applicable,  in \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  Office  of \nAdministrative  Services.  After  TA  completion,  procured  equipment  will  be  turned  over  or \ndisposed of in compliance with para. 68 of Project Administration Instructions.11 The estimated \ncost of new equipment, computer software, and databases is $40,000. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Asian Bonds Online Website Project, Phase IV, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2009.
