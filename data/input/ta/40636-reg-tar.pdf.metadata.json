The Third International Round Table on Managing for Development Results (MfDR), a \nkey event in advancing the implementation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness1, \nended in Hanoi on 4 February 2007 with the commitment to accelerate enhancement of the \ncapacity of developing countries for MfDR. The country delegations from Asia and the Pacific, \nAfrica, Latin America, and multilateral and bilateral development institutions agreed to focus on \n(i) building  institutional capacity and the demand for results through accountable leadership and \nparticipatory planning and performance-based budgeting, (ii) strengthening systems to supply \nrelevant data and information through statistics and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of results; \nand  (iii)  developing  processes  for  mutual  accountability  and  feedback  on  development \nassistance.  \n \n2.    The Asian Development Bank (ADB), committed \u201cto strengthen country capacities and \ndemand for MfDR at the local level\u201d,2 approved regional technical assistance (TA 6256)3 in \n2005 to build the capacity of selected ADB partner organizations for results-focused project \ndesign and management. This follow-on regional TA4 supports the same objective and aims to \nexpand the outreach and deepen knowledge of MfDR at the project level. The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Development Assistance Committee5 of the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand  Development  summarized  some  preliminary  lessons  about  establishing  results-based \nmanagement (RBM) systems in developing countries: (i) strong leadership for RBM is essential, \n(ii) building RBM systems requires sufficient time (5\u201310 years) and resources, (iii) begin with \npilot activities to demonstrate effective RBM practices, (iv) provide a range of different support \nmechanisms  to  establish  RBM  systems,  and  (v)  build  ownership  by  using  participatory \nprocesses.  The  design  of  the  preceding  TA  6256  took  these  lessons  into  account,  the \napplication of which yielded valuable experience and lessons for the follow-on TA. \n \n4.  TA  6256  introduced  selected  executing  agencies  (EAs)  in  17  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs) to tools and techniques used in the context of results-focused project design \nand management.6  Workshop sessions included (i) identifying and dealing with key project \nstakeholders; (ii) analyzing development challenges and their interrelationship (problem tree \nanalysis);  (iii)  formulating  appropriate  objectives  that  address  the  development  challenges \n(objectives tree); (iv) determining alternative approaches to achieve a specific objective; (v) \ndefining results chains, corresponding indicators and performance targets, and associated risks \n                                                 \n1  High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. 2005. Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Paris. \n2  Footnote 1, para. 46. ADB\u2019s commitment to MfDR is reflected in a wide range of initiatives inside ADB and in \ndeveloping member countries, and includes  support for the MfDR Community of Practice provided by the Results \nUnit of the Strategy and Policy Department., and ADB. 2005 Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina for Developing a Results-Based National Monitoring and Evaluation System for Key Projects, Manila.

Results-Focused Project Design and Management, Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 March 2007. \n5  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 2004. Results-Based Management in the Development \nCo-operation Agencies: A Review of Experiences (Executive Summary). Paris (pp. 22\u201324).  \n6  Five-day national training programs with 25\u201330 participants were conducted in Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, \nTajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. A Pacific subregional workshop was held in the Fiji Islands and included \nparticipants from the Cook Islands, the Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, and Tonga,.  \n ", "2   \nand assumptions; (vi) elaborating on the preparation of annual implementation plans; and (vii) \ncovering project monitoring and reporting practices.  \n  \n5.  While the participants in some countries were familiar with and applied the principles and \ntools of MfDR at project level occasionally if not routinely, this was not the case with others. For \nparticipants from a number of DMCs neither the concepts of participatory planning, results \nmanagement,  and  performance  M&E  were  known;  nor  were  similar  approaches  applied. \nLearning validation7 after each program highlighted these differences. Not surprisingly, through \nthe  program  evaluations  most  participants  expressed  their  interest  to  gain  a  deeper \nunderstanding of MfDR principles in general and the tools used at project level in particular. \nProject M&E and the facilitation skills to effectively engage stakeholders in planning, and M&E \nprocesses  were  specific  areas  participants  expressed  a  keen  interest  in.  The  program \nevaluations were also used as a gauge to assess the demand for a training-of-facilitators (TOF) \nworkshop. The interaction between these diverse groups of participants proved to be an asset \nand laid a foundation for cooperation between DMCs, referred to as south-south cooperation.8 \nTOF workshops were also conduced in the Philippines, with participants from Fiji and the Cook \nIslands, in Sri Lanka with participants from Afghanistan, People\u2019s Republic of China, and India, \nand in Kyrgyz Republic (see para. 9). So far a total of 95 participants have completed TOF \nworkshops. The mix of participants created a common understanding and appreciation of the \nvalue of participatory planning and management. It has also increased the availability of suitable \ninternal and external facilitators for various assignments.  \n \n6.  Following the successful completion of the TOF, selected participants were given the \nopportunity to cofacilitate introductory training programs for EAs. Even if possibilities for this on-\nthe-job training were limited, this pilot capacity development approach proved very useful. It \nstrengthened the skills and confidence of the newly graduated facilitators and provided them \nwith, in most cases, first international experience. For a pool of facilitators to gain the necessary \ncredibility, expanding this south-south on-the-job training will be essential.  \n \n7.  There is anecdotal evidence of some participants using their facilitation skills and the \nknowledge of the design tools in situations beyond those anticipated, i.e., the organization and \nimplementation of a national conference of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in Mongolia, a \nfacilitated assessment of Kazakhstan\u2019s national planning system, and the introduction of results-\nfocused project planning for government officials in the Cook Islands. To be able to assess the \noutcome of the TOF, it would be necessary to conduct a full survey of the application of the \ntools and techniques by all TOF participants.  \n \n8.  Another unexpected positive result of the TOF was the formation of FaciliNET, an e-\nnetwork of TOF graduates. Through this budding network, the members share information and \nexperiences on facilitation practices and opportunities for cofacilitation. The network and other \ncommunities of practice are useful initiatives fully owned by their members. Supporting the \nnetwork could yield a range of benefits across the Asia Pacific region, provided support is \nincremental and does not overburden this voluntary self-help initiative.   \n \n9.  From the outset, the scope of TA 6256 was limited to reach out to selected EAs and \nDMCs. While pilot-testing of results-focused organizational development approaches\u2014output 3 \n                                                 \n7  Each training program began with a pretest to establish current knowledge and ended with a final test assessing in \ndetail the knowledge acquired during the training.  \n8  It is anticipated that the participants from the various TOF workshops, when in search of external facilitators, will \ndraw from the pool of facilitators beyond their national boundaries and thus strengthen south-south cooperation.  \n ", "  3\nof TA 6256\u2014is ongoing and will continue until the end of TA implementation, the planned \nactivities for output 1 and 2 have been completed. Specifically, by December 2006, 283 EAs \nhad participated in an induction program on results-focused project design and management, \ncompared with the performance target of 250 by December 2007. In addition, 45 members of \nresident mission (RM) staff had taken part in the induction programs, an aspect that was not \nincluded in the original design of the TA but benefited all parties concerned.9  Substantial \nprogress has also been made in building a pool of local facilitators (output 2). By early March \n2007, 95 participants from government agencies, NGOs, the private sector, and RMs in 12 \nDMCs had participated in a TOF, compared with a target of 150 participants in 10 DMCs by \nSeptember 2007. While the initial intention was to conduct a national TOF immediately after the \n5-day induction program for EAs, this approach was replaced by a sequencing that allows a \ntime  lag  for  logistical  reasons  and  also  to  identify  suitable  TOF  participants  outside  the \ngovernment. Consequently, a subregional TOF was conducted in the Kyrgyz Republic bringing \ntogether  participants  from  different  countries  (Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan) and different backgrounds (government, NGOs, the private sector, \nand ADB RMs). The approach provided for a richer exchange of experiences and laid the \nfoundation for future cooperation beyond national borders\u2014referred to earlier as south-south \ncooperation. The three TOFs conducted so far followed this approach. It has to be noted that \nthe participation of 17 RM staff in these TOFs was financed from ADB\u2019s staff training budget. \nThis cooperation has benefited all participants; it enriched the discussion and strengthened \nmutual understanding. A continuation is strongly recommended. \n \n10.  The insights and experiences gained through the implementation of TA 6256 revealed a \nstronger than expected demand for capacity development in MfDR at the project level. The \nneed  to  involve  stakeholders  in  planning,  implementing,  monitoring  and  evaluating  public \nservices,  and  policies  is  growing  stronger  than  ever.  With  most  government  agencies  ill-\nequipped to facilitate the process of participatory planning and decision making, the availability \nof qualified national facilitators is critical. The TA is a direct response to the expressed demand \nfrom DMCs and RMs for developing capacity in MfDR at the project level.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA will enable selected EAs in DMCs to apply results-focused approaches and tools \nin participatory program/project design and management (outcome). The TA aims to contribute \nto more effective delivery of development programs and services by DMC government agencies \n(impact).   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA incorporates three strategic approaches to capacity development of EAs: (i) \nintroducing up to 200 EAs in selected DMCs not covered by TA 6256 to MfDR approaches and \nsystems, (ii) developing the capacity of local facilitators to support the application of results-\nbased approaches, and (iii) developing and disseminating innovative learning tools for results-\nfocused project design and management.   \n \n13.  Output  1. Familiarize EAs and NGOs with or deepen their understanding of MfDR \napproaches and systems and application in project design and management. A series of up to \n                                                 \n9 The TA did not incur cost as a result of RM staff\u2019s participation in the induction training.  \n ", "4   \n15 country workshops in DMCs that were not been covered by TA  6256 will provide the \nnecessary learning opportunities for EA senior staff and project managers responsible for ADB-\nfunded projects and NGO representatives.10 In the context of MfDR, the workshops will (i) \nintroduce analytical tools for situation analysis and project design, (ii) address stakeholder \nparticipation in the project cycle, (iii) explain how to define and measure results, (iv) deal with \nproject risks, (v) elaborate on the preparation of annual implementation plans, and (vi) provide \nan overview  of project monitoring and reporting practices. \n \n14.  Output 2. Expand in selected DMCs the pool of local facilitators11 knowledgeable in \nresults-focused project design and management. Ten national/subregional TOF workshops will \nbe  conducted  to  ensure  adequate  regional  coverage.  The  workshops  will  train  potential \nfacilitators  to  apply  participatory  techniques  for  (i)  the  design  and  monitoring  framework \napproach, and (ii) project monitoring and management, and (iii) conflict mediation. The outcome \nwill be EAs and ADB with an in-country pool of resource persons able to facilitate, for example,, \nproblem  tree  analysis,  participatory  project  planning  and  implementation  workshops,  and \nstakeholder-led  project  reviews.  Selected  facilitators  will  undergo  on-the-job  training  by \ncofacilitating  workshops  in  other  DMCs.  The  TA  will  support  FaciliNET,12  the  Asia-Pacific \nregional network of facilitators, to finalize a facilitators\u2019 code of conduct, an accreditation system, \nand standard terms of reference for a selection of events; and to set up a roster of facilitators.  \n \n15.  Output  3.  Develop  and  distribute  innovative  training  material  that  supports  the \napplication of tools and techniques for results-focused project design and management. E-\nlearning  tools  will  be  adapted/developed  for  facilitation  skills,  and  project  monitoring  and \nmanagement. A dissemination strategy will be prepared, incorporating a wide range of means, \ni.e., media, presentations at conferences, articles, the internet. The e-learning tools will also be \ndisseminated through FaciliNET and the MfDR Communities of Practice for Asia and the Pacific.  \n \n16.  The TA design is based on several assumptions essential for successful implementation \nand achievement of results. It was assumed that (i) the EAs would retain workshop participants \n(output 1) for at least 1 year, limiting the brain drain at least during that period; and (ii) the \nfacilitators would be available to perform the tasks for which they are qualified (output 2). \nFurther, the outcome of the TA will only be achieved if (i) aid agencies agree on a joint results-\nfocused agenda and pursue a harmonized approach in making it operational, and (ii) DMCs \nhave created incentives for their agencies to adopt MfDR. The latter assumption is supported by \nthe DMCs\u2019 commitment to MfDR (para. 1) and the associated performance target, ratified as \npart of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000 equivalent. Financing amounting to $850,000 on a \ngrant basis will come from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The DMC governments will provide \ncounterpart staff and miscellaneous expenses equivalent to $100,000. The TA will finance 10 \n                                                 \n10  The TA will train 1\u20132 officials of up to 200 EAs, which represent about 65% of all EAs ADB is currently working \nwith; and at least 100 NGOs, who have been identified by RMs as stakeholders in proposed projects or those \nbeing implemented. \n11  Staff members of national institutions and government agencies, NGOs, and the private sector with a background \nin facilitation, project management, or related field of expertise will be considered for the TOF workshops. \nApproximately 250 facilitators in up to 10 DMCs will be trained. The selection will be carried out by ADB in close \ncoordination with RMs.  \n12  FaciliNET was founded by the participants of the first subregional training of facilitators conducted under TA 6256-\nREG in the Philippines in July 2006. Approximately 60 TOF graduates from central Asian countries, South Asia, the \nPacific, and the Philippines have registered with the network.  \n ", "  5\nnational/subregional TOF workshops and up to 15 country induction workshops, international \nand national consulting services, training equipment and materials, and the development of e-\nlearning programs. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office \n(COSO) will implement the TA in close cooperation with the regional departments and RMs. The \nlatter will act as in-country focal points for the TA. As such, they will advise COSO on the \nselection of workshop participants from government agencies and NGOs, and render logistical \nsupport for the workshops. COSO staff and other qualified ADB staff will be resource persons. \nNo-objection letters from  DMCs will be obtained before the TA is initiated in each DMC. \n \n19.  An  international  individual  consultant  with  expertise  in  participatory  planning  and \nmanagement training (6 person-months, intermittent) will be recruited during TA implementation. \nNational  consultants/resource  persons  (10  person-months)  with  TOF  qualification  obtained \nunder output 2 of TA 6256 and output 2 of this TA will be recruited to facilitate participatory \nproject  planning  and  management  workshops  in  the  context  of  ADB-funded  projects.  The \nnational and regional training programs under outputs 1 and 2 will be conducted by COSO staff \nwith support from the participatory planning specialist. Specifically, the participatory planning \nand management specialist will (i) develop training materials; and (ii) deliver (a) up to four \ninduction workshops on project design and management, and (b) up to 10 TOF workshops in \ncooperation with COSO staff. The consultants' terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  33  months  (April  2007\u2013December  2009).  The \ninternational individual consultant and the national consultants will be selected and engaged by \nADB in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  Procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). COSO will procure and retain the training \nequipment.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis for \nResults-Focused Project Design and Management 2, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nGovernment  The DMCs meet the  Annual report on the  \u2022  DMCs institutionalize \nagencies of  performance targets  status of Millennium  results-based \ndeveloping member  determined under  Development Goals  management (RBM). \ncountries (DMCs)  Asian Development  published by DMCs  \u2022  DMCs budget \ndeliver programs and  Fund/International  planning  allocations at national, \nservices more  Development  agencies/statistical  provincial, and local \neffectively.
