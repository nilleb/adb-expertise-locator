I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $100,000,000 to China Everbright International Limited (CEIL) for the Municipal Waste-to-\nEnergy Project in Viet Nam. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. Rapid urbanization, coupled with population growth, has led to \nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) generation in Viet Nam increasing to unmanageable levels. During \n2004\u20132015, waste generation increased by about 78.2% from 15.6 million tons per year to about \n27.8 million tons per year. A significant portion of the waste collected is disposed of in landfills \nwithin  200\u2013500  meters  of  residential  areas.  Less  than  30%  of  those  sites  are  classified \nengineered or sanitary landfills. This poses a grave threat to public health in areas with high waste \ngeneration because of the contamination of ground and surface water from untreated leachate; \nemissions of airborne pollutants; and the spread of flies, mosquitoes, rodents, and dust. \n \n3.  To address the increasing problems of MSW management, the Government of Viet Nam \nissued several laws and regulations calling for an immediate attention to the management and \ndisposal  of  waste  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  Waste-to-energy  (WTE)  was \nrecognized as an effective method to reduce the waste volume by 90% and eliminate methane \n(CH4) emissions. WTE technologies use the waste heat from incineration to produce electricity \nand heat. By replacing fossil fuel combustion and avoiding CH4, WTE technologies reduce \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigate climate change. In 2014, the Prime Minister \nissued a directive to encourage private sector investments in WTE projects\u2014to manage the \nincreasing volume of solid waste and help address the country\u2019s electricity requirements. The \ndirective includes a feed-in tariff (FIT) equivalent to $0.1005 per kilowatt-hour. \n  \n4.  Despite the recent policy shift in favor of WTE and the increased interest of municipal \ngovernments in clean technologies, market barriers still limit private sector participation in WTE. \nTo date, only one plant, supported by technical assistance funds and grants, has been built with \na capacity to treat 75 tons of industrial waste per day and a power generation capacity of 1.93 \nmegawatts (MW).1 Key bottlenecks include lack of an effective public\u2013private risk allocation and \nlack of access to long-term finance. \n \n5.  Through ongoing discussions with stakeholders, the project team identified that CEIL \npossess a desirable business model that can leverage its operational experience with clean \ntechnologies to pursue new ventures in municipal-level PPP projects in Viet Nam, which are \nsmaller than the central government-led public-private partnership (PPP) projects and more \ndifficult to attract private sector participation. CEIL can effectively burn MSW with high water \ncontent in Viet Nam without supplemental fuel (such as coal), and can enter into a municipal PPP \narrangement without a sovereign guarantee.  \n \n6.  Project design. The project, through a portfolio approach, will support the construction \nand operation of a series of WTE plants with advanced clean technologies, including flue gas \nemission control to meet European Union (EU) standards, in multiple municipalities. Each WTE \n                                                \n1  Nam Son Waste Treatment Complex in Soc Son District, Ha Noi developed by the New Energy and Industrial \nTechnology Development Organization of Japan. ", "2 \nplant will treat MSW and supply electricity to the local grid. Each plant incinerates MSW, recovers \nwaste heat for power generation, purifies waste gas, and treats leachate. Under the project, CEIL \naims to develop and invest in WTE subprojects to treat 7,500 tons of MSW daily in Viet Nam. \nCEIL is developing subprojects in primary and secondary cities in the Mekong Delta and northern \nViet Nam. This project will be the first municipal WTE project financed entirely by the private \nsector. \n \n7.  Borrower. Since its establishment in 1993, CEIL has become a leading integrated \nenvironmental protection company in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Following the \nGovernment of the PRC\u2019s policy to introduce private sector participation in the environment sector \nin 2003, CEIL focused on WTE, wastewater management, and renewable energy businesses. \nCEIL has distinguished itself from its peers by implementing higher environmental standards such \nas the EU2010 Standard.2 In recognition of CEIL\u2019s environmentally sustainable operations, it has \nrecently been included in the FTSE4 Good Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index3 \nbased on compliance with global standards on environment, social, and governance practices. \n \n8.  One of the key technical challenges of WTE in Viet Nam is a low net calorific value of \nMSW with high water content\u2014estimated at 3,600\u20137,900 kilojoules per kilogram, which is much \nlower than the calorific value of MSW in developed countries (8,400\u201317,000 kilojoules per \nkilogram). CEIL has been addressing low calorific MSW in smaller cities and islands in the PRC \nthrough improved design and operational expertise.  \n \n9.  At the end of June 2017, CEIL had 32 WTE subprojects in operation with a combined \nprocessing capacity of 28,300 tons per day and generation capacity of about 1,500 gigawatt-\nhours a year. For the 6 months ended in June 2017, CEIL reported consolidated revenue of \nHK$9.1 billion ($1.2 billion) and profit attributable to equity holders of HK$1.8 billion ($0.2 billion). \nThis represents an increase of 69% in revenue and 49% in profit attributable to equity holders \ncompared with the same period in 2016. CEIL\u2019s consolidated total assets was HK$61.9 billion \n($7.9 billion) and consolidated total equity was HK$25.5 billion ($3.3 billion) at the end of June \n2017.  Listed  on  the  main  board  of  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange,  CEIL  has  a  market \ncapitalization as of 30 October 2017 of HK$48.7 billion ($6.2 billion). \n   \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n10.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: increased use of solid waste \nfor power generation as part of the country\u2019s solid waste management strategy,4 and increased \nshare of biomass-based power plants, which include WTE facilities, to account for about 2.1% of \nthe country\u2019s total installed capacity by 2030.5 \n \n11.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: MSW treated and energy produced \nfrom environmentally sustainable WTE plants in Viet Nam.6 By 2028, 2.5 million tons of MSW will \n                                                \n2  Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions (integrated pollution \nprevention and control). 24 November 2010. \n3  CEIL was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for two consecutive years (2016\u20132017). \n4  Ministry of Construction and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Viet Nam. 2009.

Outputs. The outputs will be the construction of WTE plants across Viet Nam; growth of \nlocal economy; and generation of employment. WTE subprojects will be developed with the \ncapacity to treat 7,500 tons of MSW per day; and an installed capacity of 110 MW of electricity by \n2022. The facilities will comply with ADB safeguard requirements and technical and financial \neligibility criteria. During the construction period (2018-2021), roughly $250 million of goods and \nservices will be procured from the local economy, and about 1,500 jobs created.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n13.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020 outlined 10 strategic priorities of ADB operations to address the development \nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific. The project supports three of those priorities: (i) environment \nand climate change, (ii) infrastructure development, and (iii) private sector development and \noperations.8 The project is the country\u2019s first PPP in municipal environmental infrastructure. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020 aims to foster inclusive and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. The project is aligned with two of the three pillars of the \nstrategy: (i) increasing the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery, and (ii) improving \nenvironmental sustainability and climate change response. Under the strategy, ADB will increase \nthe focus on wastewater and solid waste management, including through PPP, to promote \ninclusive urbanization.9 \n \n15.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s energy policy, which encourages interventions designed to shift reliance on fossil fuel \nsources for energy to renewable forms of energy to slow down the growth of GHG emissions and \nhelp countries achieve energy self-sufficiency.10 The project will mitigate GHGs by replacing coal \nwith MSW in power generation and through the avoidance of CH  from landfills. The project is \n4\nalso aligned with Viet Nam\u2019s commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, and will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of providing $6.0 billion per year in climate \nfinance by 2020. \n \n16.  Lessons from previous operations. The design of the project in Viet Nam took careful \nconsideration of the experience from previous WTE projects. ADB supported municipal and \nagricultural WTE projects in the PRC in 2009 and 2012.11 ADB\u2019s portfolio approach has also \nfacilitated  the  financing  of  multiple  subprojects  too  small  to  be  financed  alone.  This  has \ncontributed to PPP developments in municipal environmental infrastructure and has mitigated \nGHG emissions effectively. The first project was rated as satisfactory based on four criteria: (i) its \n                                                \n7  A carbon footprint is measured based on tCO2e. This allows for the different GHGs (i.e., carbon dioxide, CH4, nitrous \noxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride) to be compared on a like-for-like basis \nrelative to one unit of carbon dioxide. \n8  ADB. 2014.

ADB has also provided substantial support to the PPP enabling environment in Viet Nam, \nalthough the actual investment in PPP projects has been limited until now.14 The last major private \nforeign-invested PPP project was in 2002. The key issues that have impeded investments include \n(i) transparency in regulations and implementation, (ii) risk allocation between the public and \nprivate sectors, (iii) land use rights, (iv) cost-recovery tariffs, and (v) availability of long-term debt. \nWhile a new PPP law was issued in April 2015 to encourage private sector investments, private \nsector participation in infrastructure is still nascent. \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Decree 59 outlines the general principles of MSW management to be adopted \nthroughout the country. The operation of WTE facilities are considered a solid waste \ndisposal activity that is covered by the decree. MSW management activities will be \nsupported by state budgets unless a separate financing is specifically provided for \nunder this decree. \nCircular 121 outlines the various fiscal and non-fiscal incentives available for \ninvestors engaged in MSW management activities. \nDecision 2149 sets the national targets for MSW management activities for the years \n2020 and 2025. \nDecision 31 provides for specific incentives for WTE projects to encourage \ninvestments in the sector. \nManagement  CEIL sets up subproject companies to construct, own, and operate WTE plant in \neach city. CEIL will control, manage, and provide management and operational \noversight to each subproject company as the largest shareholder. \nImplementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2021 \nOperations arrangements   \nRevenue structure  Each subproject will have two revenue streams. \nPower generation. Each subproject company will sell electricity to Vietnam Electricity \nunder a 20-year power purchase agreement. Power sold under the power purchase \nagreement will be paid at a feed-in tariff of D2,114 per kilowatt-hour (equivalent to \n$0.1005 per kilowatt-hour). The law provides for periodic adjustments for fluctuations \nin foreign exchange, though the mechanism for such adjustment needs to be \nclarified. Under the law, all power generated and delivered to the metering point by \nthe subproject companies will be taken by Vietnam Electricity. \nWaste treatment. Each subproject company will enter a service agreement with the \nauthorized local state agency for processing MSW.  Waste treatment fees will be \ndetermined, based either on a competitive bidding process to be conducted by the \nlocal government or through negotiations.  \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2015.

Only suppliers that have been \nassessed to have a good record of performance, financial capacity, and governance, \namong others, will be invited to bid. \n   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEIL = China Everbright International Limited, MSW = municipal solid waste, \nWTE = waste-to-energy. \nSource: ADB. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n19.  The ADB assistance is a direct loan of up to $100 million. The direct loan will be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n20.  There is an increasing demand from the market for ADB to support decentralized PPPs to \ndeliver much needed municipal infrastructure in Viet Nam. The project is designed to provide \nfinancing support for multiple WTE subprojects that are often too small, too costly to finance and \ntime-consuming for ADB or international banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. As one of the \nfirst municipal level PPPs, the project features a strong model for private sector participation. This \nencourages, with multi-faceted demonstration effects, the private sector to invest in WTE projects \nbeyond immediate project interventions. First, the project will support the transfer of technology \nand technical expertise to effectively address urban waste management problems effectively. \nSecond, it will encourage other private sector participants to invest in WTE projects using clean \ntechnologies. Third, the project will demonstrate a new mechanism to provide a long-term, reliable \nsolution  to  address  MSW  problems,  which  is  applicable  to  other  primary  and  secondary \nmunicipalities across Viet Nam. \n  \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n21.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  As  the  proposed  ADB  investment  is  not  earmarked  for  any  specific \nsubprojects, the requirement for general corporate finance projects will apply. A qualified and \nexperienced external expert conducted a corporate audit of CEIL\u2019s environmental, health, safety, \nand social policies, procedures, and operations. The audit recommended corrective actions to \nensure that procedures and operations across all subproject business activities are adequate and \ncomply with national laws, ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and other social requirements. \nFollowing recommended corrective actions, CEIL will update its corporate environmental and \nsocial management systems satisfactory to ADB such that it is applicable to the company\u2019s \noperations in Viet Nam before the first disbursement for the financing of the subprojects. The \ninstitutional capacity and commitment of CEIL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental \nimpacts are deemed adequate.  \n \n ", "6 \n22.  The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and \neffective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts can be \nwell mitigated as incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans to be prepared by CEIL to meet \nnational and international requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. CEIL has proven \ncapacity to identify, mitigate, and manage the environmental and social impacts and risks \nassociated with its subprojects in the PRC; and will ensure this capacity is in place in Viet Nam. \nADB will ensure that CEIL employs rigorous subproject screening and categorization procedures \nto all identified subprojects to ensure that classification is in accordance with ADB categorization \nrequirements and processed in accordance with Safeguard Requirements 1\u20133 before ADB \nfunding. CEIL will report annually to ADB on its subproject portfolio environmental and social \nmanagement systems\u2019 performance and semiannually for WTE subprojects as required. \n \n23.  CEIL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.15 CEIL will report regularly to ADB on (i) compliance with such laws, and (ii) the \nmeasures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements. \n \n24.  CEIL follows the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards16, and its \nannual  report  includes  gender-disaggregated  data  from  its  subsidiaries.  CEIL\u2019s  2016 \nSustainability  Report  notes  that  males  dominate  the  energy  and  engineering  sector.  The \ncompany, nevertheless, pays attention to equal opportunity in employment and remuneration. \nCEIL safeguards rights enshrined in laws in the PRC that protect maternity and paternity leave, \nanti-discrimination, and unfair dismissal. About 24% of CEIL employees are women. In 2016, 14% \nof senior management were women while 28% of middle management were women. The \nremuneration ratio between female and male employees at senior management level was 1.08, \nbut drops to 0.90 at middle management level. Women on average undertook 11.5 more hours \nof training per year than men in 2016. CEIL\u2019s performance indicates that it promotes gender \nequality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  in  its  subsidiary  operations.  The  Human  Resources \nDepartment at the CEIL corporate level and at the subproject level in Viet Nam is responsible for \nensuring gender equality in operations. In Viet Nam, each subproject is required to follow the Law \non Gender Equality (No. 73/2006/QH11). \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n25.  CEIL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n26.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-project \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2003.
