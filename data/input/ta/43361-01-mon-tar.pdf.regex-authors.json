INTRODUCTION \n1.  The policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for the improvement of water and \nsanitation services and planning in Ulaanbaatar is directly linked to the Urban Sector Roadmap \nfor Mongolia of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The road map recommends investment \nwhere the potential return is greatest and Ulaanbaatar is singled out as a key target area. The \nplan will focus assistance on (i) improving urban planning and management; (ii) enhancing \ninfrastructure service prioritization, planning, and maintenance; and (iii) developing innovative \napproaches to attract private sector in providing urban services. An ADB fact-finding mission \nvisited Ulaanbaatar from 29 March to 2 April 2010 in preparation for this TA. A memorandum of \nunderstanding between the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB) and ADB was signed on 2 April \n2010. It reflected the mission\u2019s latest findings and understandings reached with the Government \nof  Mongolia  on  the  objective,  impact,  outcome,  output,  scope,  cost,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s3 urban fabric is divided into two distinct parts. The formal or core area \nconsists largely of apartment blocks that date back to the socialist era and have full utility \nservices, including dedicated heating, hot water, and sanitation systems. The ger areas, named \nafter the ger, the traditional Mongol tent, are large expanding unplanned areas with unserviced \nplots, unpaved roads, and scant facilities.4 Recent urban development in Ulaanbaatar has been \ncharacterized by (i) the rapid spread of these ger areas over the outskirts of the city; (ii) the \noccupation by growing numbers of ger residents of dangerous and marginal sites such as along \nstorm water channels and beneath high voltage power lines; (iii) the rapid and unplanned \ndevelopment of new apartment areas that have dated infrastructure networks, facilities, and \nmanagement systems and are unsupported by a needed expansion of infrastructure; and (iv) \nthe unauthorized encroachment by private developments into protected natural areas around \nthe city. Ulaanbaatar is now struggling to improve its obsolete infrastructure in the core city \ncenter and to cope with the demand for better service facilities in both the core and the ger \nareas. \n \n3.  Underinvestment in infrastructure and substandard operation and maintenance (O&M) \nraise the cost of doing business and restrict access to jobs and services. Compared with \nplanned  areas,  the  adjacent  ger  areas  and  the  urban  poor  who  reside  in  them  suffer \ndisproportionately  from  poor  management  and  maintenance  and  an  overall  lack  of  urban \ninfrastructure and basic urban services.5 Residents are more exposed than others in the city to \nthe risks associated with unsafe water supply, inadequate sanitation, insufficient heating, and an \nabsence of suitable roads. Most of the formal areas in Ulaanbaatar are serviced by sewerage \nsystems that connect to wastewater treatment plants. Only part of this wastewater is fully \ntreated due to inadequate plant O&M and the untreated or partially treated wastewater is \ndischarged into  rivers,  other  watercourses,  or  directly  into  the  ground,  contaminating  local \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Review of Investment Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation\u2014Mongolia: Urban Sector Roadmap. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 July 2010. \n3  The city grew from about 600,000 people in 1989 to over 1.03 million in 2007, representing 39% of the nation\u2019s \npopulation. \n4  There are three types of ger areas: (i) central ger areas (located near the built-up core of the city, with high \npotential to access infrastructure and services); (ii) middle ger areas (those that relied on \u201ctinkered\u201d water supply, \npit latrines, poor roads, and waste collection); and (iii) peri-urban ger areas (characterized by day-to-day spatial \nexpansion at the urban periphery with little or no access to infrastructure or services). \n5  The urban poor are estimated to number over 250,000. \n ", "2   \nsurface  and  groundwater  resources.  The  ger  areas  lack  water  services  and  have  no \ncomprehensive sewerage. Most residents use open pit latrines or open field defecation. Only a \nfew have septic tanks. Minimal strategic and long-term planning and little land-use regulation \nresults in haphazard development and little space for providing community facilities. These \nconditions threaten environmental and public health safety, lead to an elevated incidence of \ncontagious disease,6 reduce livelihood security, and heighten inequalities within communities \nand the overall population. Several projects have dealt with the sanitation challenges but none \nhas produced a viable, sustainable solution that can be replicated throughout the ger areas. \n \n4.  The city\u2019s current list of proposed infrastructure investments is much larger than it can \nsupport. It also lacks resources to operate and maintain existing infrastructure. A number of \nplanned  investments  will  most  likely  yield  low  economic  returns.  Without  reforms  and \nprioritization, infrastructure will become a development constraint. A planned ADB initiative to \nimprove sector governance and pricing, combined with an investment program aimed at poverty \nreduction and high economic returns, will help make the infrastructure sector a catalyst for \ngrowth  and  broad-based  development.  Current  investment  plans  must  be  examined  and \nimproved to make projects feasible and to achieve the greatest impact possible on economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction. Approaches that maximize participation by the private sector and \ncivil society should also be introduced. In 2012, ADB plans to develop a loan to finance urban \nservices infrastructure. It has stressed the need to explore new areas for ADB lending and \nnonlending  operations  in  Ulaanbaatar's  urban  sector.  The  most  critical  sectors  for  urban \ndevelopment and livelihood improvement right now are water, sanitation, and improvement of \nthe ger areas.7 Both the government and the public accord them the highest priority. The \ncreation of a quality pipeline of investments in urban infrastructure and services, along with \nrelevant TA, capacity building, policy dialogue, and knowledge products on the water and \nsanitation sector, will be a crucial step toward generating the greatest impact possible from \nADB\u2019s investments and to ensuring real improvements and operational sustainability in the two \ntargeted sectors. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact of the TA is improved water and sanitation services in Ulaanbaatar. The \noutcome of the TA includes an integrated road map for Ulaanbaatar\u2019s water and sanitation \nsector.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The TA will identify potential areas for ADB lending in urban services and will provide \nkey policy recommendations to improve services and regulations in the planning, delivery, and \ncoverage of municipal infrastructure services. The TA will focus on water and sanitation services \nand  ger  areas.  The  road  map  will  be  built  on  experiences  of  ADB,  other  donors,  and \ninternational organizations in water, sanitation and ger areas development.8 The main lessons \nlearned  from  past  interventions  show  that  institutional  and  capacity  weaknesses  are  key \n                                                 \n6  Unsafe water and unsafe hygiene practices are the main causes of diarrhea, which is closely linked to child \nmalnutrition, morbidity, and mortality. \n7  Water and sanitation services are covered by the Ulaanbaatar water and sewerage company. \n8  Key donors active in Ulaanbaatar\u2019s urban sector are the World Bank (water supply in peri-urban areas, ger area \nimprovements and heating), JICA (masterplan, solid waste management and ger area improvements), UN-Habitat \n(pilots for ger area improvements), GTZ (pilots for ger area improvements and energy-efficient housing), UNDP \n(urban governance), USAID (housing), and SIDA (land management and administration). \n ", "  3\nconstraints; and social environment and consultation, close dialogue with the Government, and \nintegration into the urban planning and development are key parameters for project design. \nBased on those previous experiences the road map will be: (i) demand-driven and participatory \nin approach, (ii) based on a long-term development vision for the city and an analysis of the \ncity's competitive advantages, (iii) assessed not only in terms of the sector but also in the \nbroader context of urban development, (iv) integrated in the local or city master plan, (v) closely \ncoordinated  with  the  Government  and  other  donors  activities,  and  (vi)  will  early  identify \ninstitutional and capacity issues for an efficient implementation of the road map investments. \nThe TA will help ADB act as a strong partner in policy dialogue at multiple levels of government \nand foster strategic partnerships with the private sector and bilateral donors. \n \n7.  The TA will (i) undertake a strategic and operationally linked urban analysis to create \ninnovative  approaches,  blend  knowledge  with  lending,9and  develop  regulation  and  policy \nreforms, focusing  on water and sanitation and the improvement of ger areas; (ii) select key \nsubsectors (related to water and sanitation and the improvement of ger areas) and provide a list \nof priority quality infrastructure investments, based on environmental sustainability, a high social \nimpact  and economic rate of return, good human resource development, and a pro-poor focus; \n(iii) develop an urban services road map and a pipeline of quality projects suitable for financing \nby ADB10 and the private sector over 5\u201310 years; (iv) rank and provide recommendations on the \ninstitutional reforms, technical support, and policy dialogue needed to improve the legal and \ninstitutional  environment  to  ensure  that  the  ADB  lending  program  will  be  effective  and \nsustainable; (v) present and build a business case for private sector participation in the water \nand  sanitation  sector;11 (vi)  outline  a  public  participation  framework  to  help  prioritize  and \nmaintain services in ger areas; (vii) optimize synergies between various assistance modalities, \nbilateral resources, and the private sector; and (viii) develop project concept notes in selected \nsubsectors that will reduce start-up delays in a project preparatory TA planned for 2011. \n \n8.  The TA to be implemented over 9 months has three components. \n \n9.  Component  1  (September\u2013November  2010). Planning and sector analysis will (a) \nreview the existing master plan and fully assess urban development expertise and infrastructure \nbottlenecks;12 (b) make recommendations for urban and infrastructure planning principles, the \nenhancing O&M of existing facilities, and the use of geographic information system applications \nto  assist  in  decision  making  and  regulation  of  land  use;13 (c)  formulate  a  future  urban \ndevelopment pattern and vision; (d) design a matrix to identify and develop priority subsectors in \nwater and sanitation and ger area improvement by highlighting their potentials for ADB business \noperation; 14  and  (e)  identify  the  road  map\u2019s  social  criteria  to  support  inclusive  urban \ndevelopment and establish a framework for public participation in choosing priority investments. \nAt the end of component 1, a tripartite meeting will be held between the executing agency \n(MUB), ADB, and stakeholders to validate the core subsector for the urban services road map. \n                                                 \n9  The TA will identify a set of relevant knowledge product proposals from the investment program to disseminate \nknowledge and best practices, including an in-depth study of key innovative program initiatives. \n10  Different lending modalities will be envisaged, such as a multitranche financing facility. \n11 This activity will refer to a pilot case for public\u2013private partnerships (PPP) in the water and sanitation area \npreviously developed for ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Grant to Mongolia for the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development Project. Manila (Grant \n0204-MON). \n12 The TA will coordinate closely on this with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) team, especially \nregarding the ongoing urban master plan revision for Ulaanbaatar. \n13 The consultant will refer to ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Cadastral Survey and Land Registration \nProject. Manila (Loan 1736-MON and TA 3395-MON). \n14 This is to be undertaken in cooperation with JICA, which is also supporting development of the same area. \n ", "4   \n10.  Component 2 (November 2010\u2013May 2011). The policy and reform framework will (a) \nconsolidate the road map in the selected subsector; (b) make recommendations on the key \nissues of pricing, planning, land use and land acquisition,15 as well as on the opportunities for \nprivate sector participation,16 improvements in infrastructure maintenance, and the institutional \nreform  necessary  to  execute  and  sustain  the  road  map;  (c)  establish  a  plan  for  priority \nknowledge products,17 policy dialogues, capacity building,18 and TA relevant to the targeted \nsubsector; (d) identify and integrate initiatives from other donors, international organizations, \nand  the  government;  and  (e)  develop  urban  indicators  linked  to  urban-related  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals for monitoring the outcomes and outputs of the road map.  \n \n11.  Component 3 (December 2010\u2013March 2011). The investment plan will (a) define with \nADB and the government counterpart priority infrastructure investments in the subsector road \nmap to be included in the project preparatory TA for 2011; (b) prepare a series of project \ninvestment  proposals  at  the  concept  paper  stage,  including  preliminary  technical  criteria, \nenvironmental  assessment,  social  safeguards  and  analysis,  and  financial  and  economic \nassessments; and (c) identify priority TA, knowledge products, and complementary projects to \nbe financed by ADB, the private sector, and other funds or partners. \n \n12.  Because the TA components and the nature and scope of the subsectors will be clarified \nduring TA implementation, provision will be made for supplementary individual consultants to \neither consolidate the expertise already available or supplement the needed expertise. Three \nworkshops will disseminate the findings of each component and assure that stakeholders take \npart in selecting investment proposals and institutional reforms.  The main potential risks to TA \nperformance include (i) a government reluctance to accept the proposed investment program, (ii) \na  lack  of  cooperation  from  other  donors  and  stakeholders,  (iii)  inadequate  support  and \nperformance from the government and stakeholders, and (iv) insufficient or late delivery of data. \nThe TA will mitigate these risks through the consultative approach and by working closely with \nthe MUB and the Ulaanbaatar Water and Sewerage Company to get the data and information it \nneeds. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $670,000, of which $600,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, to be administered by ADB. \nThe Government of Mongolia will provide in-kind support equivalent to $70,000 by providing \noffice  space  and  equipment,  office  communications,  and  remuneration  and  per  diem  for \ncounterpart staff. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The MUB, which has been a partner in other ADB and World Bank projects, will be the \nexecuting and implementing agency.  The MUB needs consulting support, strategic advice, and \n                                                 \n15 The  work  will  coordinate  with  ADB\u2019s  subproject  on  strengthening  of  safeguards  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement in Mongolia. ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard \nSystems. Manila (TA 7566-REG, July 2010)/subproject on strengthening of safeguard for land acquisition and \nresettlement in Mongolia. \n16 The TA will coordinate with ADB\u2019s Public\u2013Private Partnership Development Project (for 2010 approval) to improve \nthe legal framework for PPP and to support the newly established department of PPP and concession, State \nProperty Committee. \n17 The team leader  will take the lead in coordinating inputs for and developing the knowledge products plan. \n18 This plan will build on past experiences in policy dialogue and capacity-building efforts. The TA will learn from \nimplementation problems encountered in the past. ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard of Directors: Proposed Loan to Mongolia for the Ulaanbaatar Heat Efficiency. Manila (Loan 1548-MON). \n ", "  5\ncapacity development to define an ensuing project that will be prepared under a future project \npreparatory TA.  The current TA will be implemented over 9 months and is expected to start in \nSeptember 2010 and to be completed by the end of May 2011. The TA will finance consulting \nservices, workshops, training, field work, and survey costs. It will require an estimated 47 \nperson-months of consulting services\u201417 person-months of international consultants and 30 \nperson-months of national consultants. The main fields of expertise will be urban planning, \nmunicipal infrastructure, water and sanitation, safeguards, finance and economics, and private \nsector  participation.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended time to time). \n \n15.  The consultants for component 1 or those hired through the supplementary provision for \nconsultants will be engaged as individual consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Individual  international \nconsultants  (7  person-months)  will  be  supported  by  four  national  consultants  (12  person-\nmonths). The supplementary individual consultants will provide an estimated 3 person-months \nof consultancy, distributed as 1 person-month of international consultancy and supported by 2 \nperson-months of national consultancy. The use of individual consultants is justified because \ncomponent 1 is an exploratory phase involving a preliminary analysis of strategic management \ndecisions. Each consultant is expected to explore a full range of approaches in a distinctive field \nof expertise and, taking into consideration the complexity of urban development in Ulaanbaatar, \npropose  innovative,  feasible  directions  for  integrated  development  linked  with  water  and \nsanitation service. Component 1 will be closely supervised by ADB\u2019s TA team, which has \nexperience in Mongolia in urban strategic study, infrastructure programming, and social issues. \nUnder the direct coordination of ADB\u2019s task manager for the project, each individual consultant \nwill work closely with the infrastructure specialist to consolidate efforts with those of the other \nindividual consultants. The preparation, quality control, and submission of the strategic reports \nwill be the responsibility of the infrastructure specialist. This approach will also permit early \nmobilization of the consultants, preventing a delay in the delivery of the TA outputs necessary to \nstart the 2011 project preparatory TA in the first quarter of 2011. Prompt deployment will avoid \nthe difficult working conditions imposed by the harsh Mongolian winter. \n \n16.  The consultants for components 2 and 3 will be engaged through a consulting firm in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  A  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  for  9  person-months  of  international  consultancy \nsupported by 16 person-months of national consultancy. The firm will be selected based on the \nquality- and cost- based selection method, using a 90:10 ratio. The heavy weighting on the \nquality of the proposal is considered appropriate because of the complexity of the environment \nfor strategic options in the delivery and financing of basic urban services. ADB's simplified \ntechnical proposal will be used to select and engage the consultants. The equipment for TA \nimplementation will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time) and will be turned over to MUB after completion of the TA. The \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nUlaanbaatar Water and Sanitation Services and Planning Improvement, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Performance Targets  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved water and  The proportion of urban  National statistic office,  Effective implementation of \nsanitation services in  households with access  household  TA recommendations and \nUlaanbaatar  to improved water  socioeconomic survey  validation of future project \nsupply increases from    proposals \n46% in 2008 to 65% by  Urban sector report of   \n2020.  government and  Other urban sectors are \n  international  improved \nThe proportion of urban  organizations   \nhouseholds with access    Risks \nto improved sanitation  ADB and international  Lack of coordination \nincreases from 27% in  sector assessment and  among project \n2008 to 55% by 2020.  progress report on  stakeholders \n  Millennium   \nDevelopment Goals  Change in government \n  priorities in the urban \nsector \n \nExternal shocks related to \ncommodity prices or \nextreme weather \nconditions \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIntegrated road map in  The MUB and ADB  ADB country  Commitment of the \nwater and sanitation  endorse the sector road  partnership strategy  people\u2019s committees  to \nsector for Ulaanbaatar  map and project  and program  undertake necessary policy \ninvestment by mid- and institutional reforms \n2011.   \nActive participation and \nsense of ownership from \nstakeholders and project \nbeneficiaries \n \nRisks \nReluctance of the \ngovernment to accept \nproposed strategic reforms \nand investment program \n \nLack of cooperation from \nother donors and \nstakeholders \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
