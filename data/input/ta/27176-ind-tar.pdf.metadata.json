INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of India has requested the Bank to provide an advisory technical\nassistance (TA) to strengthen the capacity of the Government and the private sector to plan and\nimplement environmentally sound development projects utilizing the environmental impact\nassessment (EIA) planning procedure, and to strengthen the related EIA regulatory frameworks.\nA Fact-Finding Mission to India in June 1993 reached an understanding with the Government\non the objectives, scope, cost, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. India, the world's seventh largest and second most populous country, recently\nembarked on structural reforms to restore economic growth and improve the efficiency of\ndevelopment through new liberalized policies for agricultural, industrial, and infrastructure\ndevelopment. These policy adjustments were complemented by policies to reduce poverty. It\nis expected that India will achieve rapid economic development through industrialization and\nstrengthening of infrastructure to support the growth process. There are grounds for concern\nthat the expected rapid economic development together with population growth will exacerbate\nthe growing problem of environmental degradation in India; thus, the sustainability of economic\ndevelopment is in question. Deforestation, land quality degradation, loss of biodiversity,\ninefficient use of coastal resources and other critical ecosystems, water pollution, air pollution,\nand poor management of toxic and hazardous substances are all prevalent in India today. The\nregulatory framework for environmental protection is inadequate.\n3. An environmental policy framework already exists in the form of a number of policy\ndocuments, acts, and guidelines such as the National Water Policy 1987, National Land Use\nPolicy 1988, National Forest Policy 1988, Policy Statement for Abatement of Pollution 1991,\nForest Conservation Act 1980 (amended in 1988), National Conservation and Policy Statement\non Environment and Development, Environment Protection Act 1986, Water-Prevention and\nControl of Pollution Act 1974 (amended in 1988), and Air-Prevention and Control of Pollution Act\n1981 (amended in 1987). Pollution standards have been issued and guidelines for EIA of major\nprojects have been promulgated and utilized to a limited extent. Recent environmental\nregulations require an environment audit of all industrial development projects to review and\nmonitor compliance with such regulations.\n4. The preparation of EIAs for development projects has so far been required,2 on\nthe basis of an Executive Order (EO) in line with the Environment Protection Act 1986 g. The\nprojects covered by the EO are limited to large-scale developments in the industry, mining,\nirrigation, power, transportation, and communication sectors, as well as projects proposed to be\nlocated in ecologically sensitive areas. An administrative structure has been set up, requiring\na preliminary EIA followed where necessary, by preparation of a full EtA and environmental\nThe TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in January 1994.\nPrior to January 1994.\nAn EIA notification dated 27 January 1994 has now made EIA mandatory for projects above certain specified\nthresho'ds.\n-\t\n\u2022i\t I", "2\nmanagement plan. This system is very similar to the Bank's EIA approach. In addition, regional\nEtA studies, particularly for river basin developments, which consider the cumulative impacts of\na variety of projects, have recently been undertaken. Recent legislation has also been passed\nrequiring land use zoning within the concept of regional planning, and coastal zone management\nplanning that imposes restrictions on types of developments within a relatively narrow strip of\ncoastline.\n5. The implementation of the regulations noted above involves no less than 15\nministries, a larger number of government departments, as well as private sector and non-\ngovernment organizations (NGOs). The Government has already in place a number of legal\nregulations to control industrial sources of pollution. Because of a number of constraints,\nhowever, it is now considering a balanced set of positive incentives as well as legal disincentives.\nIn particular, it is looking at the development and adoption of cleaner industrial technologies\nwhereby incentives such as softer repayment terms for loans used for financing waste\nminimization measures and reduced fees on effluent discharges may be available to industries\nadopting cleaner technologies. The institutional setting and legal framework that have evolved\nin the last few years identify responsibilities for implementation of environmental policies and EtA\nregulations under the overall supervision of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF).\nMost of the line ministries have established environment cells that vary considerably in\ncapabilities to undertake and administer EIA studies.\n6. A review of the Indian EIA experience in the last several years indicates limited\neffectiveness because of insufficient expertise at the practitioner and reviewer levels and lack of\nunderstanding and appreciation at the decision-maker level. There is limited ability to apply EIA\nat the regional or river basin level so as to evaluate the impacts of a large number of diverse\nactivities. MOEF has developed a set of sectoral EIA guidelines, but recognizes a serious gap\nin the methodologies and guidelines for regional or river basin multi-project EIA and regional\nenvironmental planning. Such methodologies and guidelines need to be established in India in\nline with the Bank's regional economic-cum-environmental planning procedures in order to\nsustain the development of natural resources. In addition, a recent review of the legal framework\nindicates that despite copious statutes and legislation, not enough is being done to protect the\nenvironment partly because of a lack of consistency in the interpretation of the various laws and\nregulations.\n7. With the advent of the Government's liberalized development policies and the\nBank's key role in assisting the Government to formulate and implement these policies, it is\nappropriate and timely for the Bank to also assist the Government in improving its environmental\nplanning framework by strengthening the legislative framework as well as the institutional and\nhuman resource capacity. Such assistance is in line with the medium-term strategy of the Bank\nfor addressing cross-cutting issues and, in particular, for assisting developing member countries\n(DMCs) in capacity building. Through its experience of providing similar assistance to such\ncountries, the Bank is in a unique position to assist the Government to establish a series of\ncenters of excellence in EIA and environmental law and to introduce effective regional\nenvironmental planning and EIA, including a regulatory framework with guidelines and related\ntraining courses to meet the needs of decision-makers, administrators, and environment\nspecialists in India.", "3\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The TA aims to assist the Government to strengthen its overall capability to\nimplement national environmental planning and management by improving its EIA program,\napplications of regional environmental planning, as well as environmental law research and\neducation. The TA will support an intensive effort by the Government for institutional and human\nresource capacity building primarily by (i) refining of environmental planning and EIA\nmethodologies and procedures as well as related regulations, and (ii) training of an adequate\nnumber of administrators and environmental specialists throughout the country.\nB.\t Scope\n9. The TA has two components: environmental assessment capacity (Component\nA) and environmental law (Component B). Environmental impact assessment capacity involves\nthese activities:\n(i) preparation and refinement of procedural manuals and guidelines on EIA,\ndevelopment of training materials for utilization of these guidelines with a focus\non EIA team training for mid- and senior-level project and field study managers;\n(ii) development and implementation of training courses to be carried out by the\nNational Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) for (i) training in\nEIA administration, quality control, and review techniques; (ii) training in\nintegration of EIA and project planning for decision-makers; and (iii) training\nteams of EIA practitioners in project and regional EIA. About 150 specialists will\nreceive such training;\n(iii) external training of two senior Government officials concerned with\nimplementation of the regional EIA program (planning based on carrying capacity)\nand industrial environment audit, with a particular focus on technologies for\npollution prevention and waste minimization, and on environmental considerations\nin regional and industrial development; and\n(iv) preparation of a five-year human resource development (HRD) plan to meet\nnational EIA program requirements including feasibility-level analysis of the\nrequirements for training facilities, external training, and associated costs; and a\nproposal for implementation of the five-year HRD plan.\nThe environmental law component involves assistance with policy research to formulate or\namend environmental legislation and with the development of environmental law networking.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The TA is estimated to cost $605,000, of which the foreign exchange cost is\nestimated at $178,000 and the local currency cost at $427,000 equivalent (see Appendix 1). The\nGovernment contribution is estimated at $105,000 equivalent. The Bank will finance on a grant\n--=--- ----------", "4\nbasis the total foreign exchange cost of $178,000 and part of the local currency cost of an\nequivalent of $322,000. Thus a total of $500,000 will be provided on a grant basis.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. MOEF will implement the TA. MOEF will set up a Project Office in New Delhi to\nsupervise the TA and liaise with the Bank on the engagement of consultants, procurement of\nequipment, maintenance of accounts, organization for external and local training, and other\nadministrative tasks. The terms of reference for consultants' services are provided in Appendix\n2. MOEF will assign a Director, who will have overall responsibility for TA implementation, and\na Program Manager who will be responsible for day-to-day TA implementation under the\nsupervision of the TA Director. The procurement of equipment to be retained by MOEF on\ncompletion of the TA will be carried out by the consultants on behalf of the Government and in\naccordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement. MOEF will provide the Bank with a list\nof institutions highly qualified in EIA, that can provide domestic consultants and are willing to\nundertake the TA. The consultants will be contractually responsible to the Bank, but will be\nsupervised by the TA Director and Program Manager on procedural matters such as conducting\ntraining courses and preparing case studies.\n12. The Bank will engage the services of international (3 person-months) and\ndomestic (43 person-months) consultants pursuant to the Bank  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. For the domestic consultants in Component A, NEERI will be selected following the\nspecial selection procedures specified in Section 6.14 in the Bank  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants because of NEERI's experience in similar projects.\n13. NEERI1 will provide 23 person-months of domestic experts in the fields of EIA,\nenvironmental modelling and monitoring, curriculum development, instructional materials\npreparation, training, regional economic and environmental planning, air quality management,\nwater quality management, natural resource management, environmental health, socioeconomic\nand resettlement issues, risk assessment, and management information systems.\n14. The Centre for Environmental Law (CEL)2 will be assisted in Component B by a\nteam of domestic and international consultants which will provide 20 person-months in the field\nof environmental legislation and provide international inputs for Component A as well. This team\nof internationally recruited and domestic consultants will be selected following international\nNEERI is recognized as India's leading EIA institution for analytical work as wefi as training. NEERI has\nestablished a national network and international contacts, which ensures that the very best EIA specialist\nwould be available for the TA. NEERI has an independent corporate status as a research institute, and has\nperformed and continues to perform consulting services for the Government with repect to environmental\nissues. The request of the Government to appoint NEERI is supported for the reasons given above and also\nbecause the TA would then facilitate delineation and strengthening of centers of EIA excellence networked\nthrough NEERI and MOEF and which can be called upon by the Bank to carry out EIA studies for Bank\nprojects with assurance of high quality at low cost.\nCEL is a nongovernment organization (NGO) that provides facilities for legal research, education, legal\ninterventions, networking, and advocacy. MOEF has designated CEL as a national facility and as a\ncooperating agency for this TA.", "5\nrecruitment procedures specified in the Bank Guidellnes on the Use of Consultants.\n15. The TA will be implemented over a period of about 18 months and discussed in\na meeting between the representatives of the Bank, the Government, and the consultants. A\ntripartite review will be carried out in the 4th and 17th months.\n16.\t\nThe consultants for Components A and B will be responsible for submitting the\nfollowing reports to the Government and the Bank:\n(i) inception reports, to be submitted at the end of the third month, after mobilization\nof consultants;\n(ii) progress report for Component A, including a case study report at the end of the\n10th month, training course evaluations at the end of the 14th month, an Expert\nSystems for Environmental Screening Report and software at the end of the 16th\nmonth, and for Component B, an Environmental Law Management Information\nSystem and Network at the end of the 16th month;\n(iii) draft final reports, including for Component A only, an HRD-EIA feasibility study\nand recommendations for the establishment of centers of EIA excellence to be\nsubmitted at the end of the 17th month; and\n(iv) a final report within two weeks of the final tripartite review, taking into account the\ncomments of the Government and the Bank.\n17.\t The Government, the Bank, and the consultants will discuss within two weeks of\ntheir submission during tripartite meetings the inception reports and the draft final reports.\nIV.
