Justification \n \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) was requested by the Government of Mongolia \nto meet the capacity building needs of implementing agencies and facilitate the compliance of \npolicy actions while improving their effectiveness and future sustainability. \n \n2.  Some of the policy changes that the policy-based loan aims to promote might be politically \nunpopular and difficult for the public to accept (e.g., policy action on preferential tax for higher-\nquality, less-polluting, and transportation fuel). Environmental education, such as on the link \nbetween air pollution and health, and fuel consumption and the environment, is critical to secure \npublic support. The TA will recruit an environment education and communication specialist to \nassist the government in designing and implementing effective campaigns to educate citizens on \nthe health risks from air pollution, and on environmentally friendly behaviors that can cumulatively \nreduce emission.  \n \n3.  In addition, better understanding of air pollution problems and quality assurance would \nimprove the usefulness of the air quality data to assess progress and inform new air pollution \npolicies. The Ulaanbaatar urban air quality and emission monitoring network would benefit from \na needs assessment, upgrade, and expansion (to cover the rapidly expanding urban areas). The \nair quality monitoring specialist will assist the central and municipal agencies in preparing a \nroadmap for the monitoring network upgrades. A needs assessment will also be conducted for \nthe  portable  emission  monitors  for  compliance  control  (e.g.,  heat-only  boilers\u2019  or  vehicles\u2019 \ncompliance with emission standards). A budget plan will be developed for fundraising. \n \n4.  Government agencies need assistance in devising sustainable solutions and financial \nincentives for greening the construction sector and promoting innovative yet affordable heating \ntechnologies\u2014including  alternatives  to  coal-based  products;  insulation  and  other  energy-\nefficiency construction materials; and suitable feed-in tariffs for small-scale, renewable energy \ngeneration. Although there are multiple alternatives to household coal heating solutions (such as \ndistrict heating, gas, electrical, and renewable heating), the government\u2019s challenge is to prioritize \ncost-efficient, time-bound interventions. Another challenge is to understand the affordability for \nindividual households to replace traditional coal heating stoves with alternative clean technologies \nand improve their energy efficiency. Also, knowledge and capacity have been identified as \nconstraints for government agencies and the private sector to access international climate \nfinancing for green technologies.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  Output 1. Environmental education and outreach programs designed and delivered. \nEnvironmental education on the link between fuel use and air pollution, air pollution and health, \nand air pollution and climate change is critical to secure public support for policy changes that \nmay be politically unpopular or difficult for the public to accept, but can reduce cumulative \nemissions.  \n \n6.  Output 2. Air quality and air pollution monitoring capacity improved. The needs of \nthe Ulaanbaatar ambient air quality monitoring network will be assessed, and suggestions will be \nmade on technology suitable for the city (e.g., monitors for particulate matter of less than 2.5 \nmicrometers in diameter [PM ]). The assessment will also review the appropriateness of low-\n2.5\ncost air-quality sensors to further expand the network at a manageable cost. The improved \n ", "2 \nambient air quality network will be complemented by portable emission monitors for compliance \ncontrol (e.g., heat-only boilers\u2019 or vehicles\u2019 compliance with emission standards).  \n \n7.  Output  3.  Green  technologies,  and  financing  mechanisms  for  their  uptake, \nassessed and introduced. The technical evaluation of energy-efficient heating systems and \nconstruction modes needs to be complemented by an assessment of financing strategies that \ngovernment institutions and the private sector can use to ensure those technologies can be \npurchased and sustainably used by households. Capacity building is also needed to enable public \ninstitutions and enterprises to design cleaner and greener projects and access the growing \nopportunities for climate financing available to Mongolia. Such projects will be demonstrated by \nat least one pilot project. \n \n8.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, to be financed on a grant basis by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-VI) ($250,000), and the \nCities Development Initiative for Asia Fund ($250,000). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff to facilitate dialogue with implementing agencies, office \nspace for meetings, and other in-kind contributions.
