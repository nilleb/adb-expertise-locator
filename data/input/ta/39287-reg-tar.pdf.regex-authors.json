The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  allocates  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) \nresources in accordance with its performance-based allocation (PBA) policy1 and revised ADF \ngrant framework.2 As agreed during ADF X negotiations, revisions to the PBA policy were \napproved  by  ADB's  Board  of  Directors  on  11  November  2008.  The  revised  ADF  grant \nframework, approved in September 2007, aligned ADB\u2019s grant allocation policies with that of \nInternational  Development  Association  (IDA)  14 3   and  the  debt  sustainability  framework \ndeveloped by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.4 The debt sustainability \nframework relies on debt sustainability analyses (DSAs), conducted by IMF and World Bank for \nIDA-only and poverty reduction and growth facility-eligible countries, usually once a year. Under \nthe revised ADF grant framework, ADF grants are now allocated solely on the basis of reducing \nthe risk of future external debt distress, with countries of high and moderate risk receiving 100% \nor 50%, respectively, of their allocation in ADF grants.  \n \n2.  Adopting and directly linking ADF grant allocation to the debt sustainability framework \nhas significant operational and financial implications for ADF countries and ADB. The first \nconcern  is  the  debt  sustainability  framework\u2019s  implementation,  as  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary \nresponsibilities require its staff to confirm DSA results. This means that ADB staff must now \nparticipate in the DSAs. Second, ADB\u2019s ADF grant framework is also aligned with IDA\u2019s policy \non nonconcessional borrowing by IDA grant recipients, implying that countries receiving IDA \n(and ADF) grants may face sanctions by IDA\u2014and due to its alignment, also by ADB\u2014if they \nborrow on nonconcessional terms. Borrowing on nonconcessional terms may harm a country\u2019s \ndebt sustainability and undermine IDA and ADB\u2019s efforts to improve a country\u2019s external risk \nrating.5  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Policies that determine the level of ADF grant and loan mix are either new to ADB clients \nor have recently been adjusted. ADF clients need to understand the policies on five levels: (i) \nthe nature of the revised performance criteria as well as the basis for their revision; (ii) the \nframework for resource allocation decisions; (iii) links between the PBA policy and the revised \nADF grant framework; (iv) IDA\u2019s policy on nonconcessional borrowing, as ADB\u2019s is fully aligned \nwith it; and (v) links between the policies, their outcomes, policy dialogue, and country strategy.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila (5 September). \n3  IDA. 2005. IDA 14: Report from the Executive Directors of the International Development Association to the Board \nof Governors. Washington (10 March). \n4  International  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank.  2004.  Debt  Sustainability  in  Low-Income  Countries:  Further \nConsiderations on an Operational Framework and Policy Implications. Washington, D.C. (10 September). \n5  IDA has identified a set of criteria by which nonconcessional borrowing will not trigger sanctions. The Operations \nCommittee, upon the recommendations of a group of representatives from departments within the World Bank, \ndecides whether sanctions should be imposed on a case-by-case basis. Sanctions imply either a hardening of IDA \n(ADF) terms, or a reduction in grant volume. Countries that do not receive IDA grants\u2014though they are IDA-grant \neligible\u2014do not fall under the nonconcessional borrowing policy, i.e., they will not face sanctions from IDA. \n ", "2   \n4.  Moreover, given important changes in the PBA policy, such as the cap on the largest \nADF borrowers and the phase-out of post-conflict ADF grants for Afghanistan and Timor-Leste, \nit  is  essential  that  borrowing  countries  understand  how  the  revised  PBA  policy  works. \nStrengthening government officials\u2019 knowledge of the PBA system will help them explain the \ntechnical reasons for changes in country performance assessment (CPA) ratings to civil society \norganizations  that  sometimes  use  the  published  CPA  ratings  to  monitor  a  government\u2019s \nperformance.  In addition, since the biannual ADF allocation for 2009\u20132010 is based on the \nrevised grant framework, it is crucial that ADF clients understand the links between the PBA \npolicy and the revised ADF grant framework as they have a direct impact on future resource \nallocations. \n5.  While only one ADB developing member country is receiving debt relief under the highly \nindebted poor country initiative,6 good debt management is also important for other ADF-\nrecipient countries, including those that currently are not classified as having a high risk of future \ndebt distress.  \n6.  The concept for this regional capacity development technical assistance7 (TA) emerged \nduring ADF X discussions. Borrower representatives expressed that ADF clients need to gain a \nbetter understanding of the revised policies and their implications, especially those on resource \nallocation. Donor shareholders support deeper client engagement in the process, and client \ninterest was strong both in recent government official induction courses held in October 2008 \n(where the CPA and DSA were briefly introduced) and in earlier PBA workshops (such as the \none held in November 2008 in Bangkok, funded by an earlier regional TA project).8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The purpose of the TA is to contribute to more effective use of ADF resources, thereby \nindirectly contributing to poverty reduction. The outcome is expected to be greater awareness of \nhow ADB allocates its ADF resources, improved technical skills for debt sustainability analysis, \nand  better  knowledge  of  the  revised  PBA  policy,  debt  sustainability  framework,  and \nnonconcessional borrowing policy. Key inputs will be training, technical workshops, and TA to \nimprove debt management in key ADF-only recipient countries. These inputs will improve the \nopportunity for policy dialogue between respective country teams and ADF clients.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  key  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  developing  in-country  capacity  for  better  debt \nsustainability  analysis  and  understanding  of  the  PBA  policy  and  the  revised  ADF  grant \nframework, resulting in improved policies and institutions. Reports, such as DSAs that are \nstand-alone documents and are produced as part of IMF article IV missions, will be completed \nwith an increased degree of country ownership and understanding of the technical models used. \nDebt management will also be improved through training in information technology and various \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.

Manila (15 February).  \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 3 February 2009. \n8  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for the Regional Capacity Building Workshop on Performance-Based Allocation \nof ADF Resources. Manila (2 February). \n ", "  3\nassessment tools. Key activities will be two regional PBA policy and ADF grant framework \nworkshops for Pacific (with about 24 participants) and non-Pacific countries (with about 32 \nparticipants), which will be jointly facilitated with staff from the World Bank, and up to two debt \nmanagement training programs (or workshops) in regional hubs (with about 10\u201315 participants \neach). Where there is strong country demand, debt management training will not be limited to \nADF-eligible countries only. Each borrowing country will be invited to nominate two persons to \nattend a designated workshop. Workshops on the PBA policy and ADF grant framework are \nexpected to last 2 days, while training on debt sustainability analysis and related topics is \nexpected to be 3\u20135 days. Resident mission and headquarters staff involved in CPAs and DSAs \nwill participate in these workshops. \n9.  Activities covered during the PBA policy and ADF grant framework workshops will \n(i)  describe the process of preparing CPAs; \n(ii)  explain approved revisions to PBA systems, and where possible, in collaboration \nwith the World Bank; \n(iii)  describe links to IDA policies; and \n(iv)  explain  the  revised  ADF  grant  framework  and  the  process  of  replenishment \nnegotiations.  \n \nThe activities during the debt management training/workshops (both technical sessions and \nmore generalist training) are expected to  \n \n(i)  explain links between the DSA, the revised ADF grant framework, and ADF grant \nallocation; \n(ii)   explain ADB\u2019s approach to nonconcessional borrowing in ADF-recipient countries; \n(iii)  apprise governments of ADB\u2019s new role in conducting DSAs; \n(iv)  explain the mechanism behind debt distress risk rating and how ADB\u2019s can \nsometimes vary from that of the World Bank; \n(v)  provide  training  to  government  officials  to  improve  capacity  in  analyzing  the \nsustainability of public debt, including a hands-on tailor-made training program on \nWorld Bank-IMF DSA for low-income countries; and \n(vi)  introduce government officials to other debt management tools that are being \ndeveloped by other international financial institutions and relevant agencies, such \nas the debt management performance assessment.  \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s PBA and DSA focal points will take the lead in organizing the workshops. Given \nthe alignment between ADB\u2019s PBA policy, the ADF grant framework, and nonconcessional \nborrowing  policies  with  those  of  IDA,  ADB  staff  will  explore  collaboration  with  IDA  in  the \nworkshops and training seminars. To support ADB staff, consultants will assist in preparation for \nthe workshops. Assistance of resource persons from public agencies and international financial \ninstitutions will also be required. Smaller  breakout sessions and hands-on training in key \nanalytical packages will supplement the presentations. Participants will receive a package of \ninformation materials and other relevant documents. There is also scope to support, on a pilot \nbasis and where required, international consultants to support capacity building in debt offices \nrelating to improving the quality of external debt data.  \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 to be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program and will be financed from the Technical Assistance Special Fund IV. \nThis will support travel costs, accommodation, and per diem for the participants. It will also \ncover payment for consultancy services and costs of resource persons for the PBA policy and \nADF grant framework workshops and debt management trainings, and other related capacity-\nstrengthening tools. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB will be the Executing Agency. The Resource Mobilization and Allocation Unit in the \nStrategy and Policy Department will administer the TA, in close cooperation with the Treasury \nDepartment's  ongoing  TA 9,  operation  departments,  resident  missions,  and  host  country \ngovernments. It is also anticipated that IDA will participate in the workshops. The TA will be \nimplemented by ADB in consultation with host governments of each workshop location. \n13.  The  TA  implementation  period  will  be  from  February  2009  to  February  2011. \nCollaboration  with  host  governments  is  expected  to  involve  mainly  logistical  and  protocol \naspects of organizing the workshops and trainings. The TA will engage for about 60 days a \nnational consultant for each PBA policy and ADF grant framework workshops. ADB will also \nengage a national consultant for about 60 days for each of the debt management trainings. ADB \nalso  plans  to  engage  international  consultants  for  the  on-the-job  training  in  strengthening \nexternal debt data statistics, as well as resource persons to conduct debt management trainings \nin specific hubs and, where required, to take part in more specific debt management tasks in \nselected ADF-recipient countries. The terms of reference for the consultants are outlined in \nAppendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  as  individuals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook.10  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening the Implementation of the Asian Development Fund Grant Framework in ADB\u2019s \nDeveloping Member Countries, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008.
