THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Strategic Climate Fund, (iii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the ADB \nStrategic Climate Fund, and (iv) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nSanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, all \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Coastal Towns Environmental Infrastructure \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  strengthen  climate  resilience  and  disaster  preparedness  in  eight \nvulnerable coastal pourashavas (secondary towns with a population of 15,000 to 60,000) of \nBangladesh.2 The project takes a holistic and integrated approach to urban development and \nwill (i) provide climate-resilient municipal infrastructure; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity, \nlocal governance, and public awareness for improved  urban planning and service delivery \nconsidering  climate  change  and  disaster  risks.  Key  infrastructure  investments  include  (i) \ndrainage;  (ii)  water  supply;  (iii)  sanitation;  (iv)  cyclone  shelters;  and  (v)  other  municipal \ninfrastructure including emergency access roads and bridges, solid waste management, bus \nterminals, slum improvements, boat landings, and markets.3 Investments will benefit the poor \nand  women.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives \n(MLGRDC), acting through its Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and the \nDepartment of Public Health Engineering (DPHE), will be the executing agencies of the project.4 \nProject management and administration support will be provided under the project.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The project is prioritized in the government\u2019s Strategic Program for Climate Resilience \n(2010) under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, and will demonstrate new approaches for \nintegrating  climate  resilience  into  urban  development  in  coastal  pourashavas. 5  The \ngovernment\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  targets  assistance  to  vulnerable  coastal \npopulations requiring investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and urban planning.6 The \nproject is consistent with the Bangladesh country partnership strategy, which targets assistance \nto vulnerable coastal areas in adapting to the risks of climate change,7 and is consistent with the \nADB Urban Operational Plan to promote climate-change-resilient cities.8   \n4.  Climate change is a critical development issue for Bangladesh. The country\u2019s low-lying \ncoastal zone (consisting of 19 districts with an estimated population of 38.1 million, of which 8.6 \nmillion is urban) is highly vulnerable to cyclones, storm surges, sea level rise, and salinity \nintrusion.  A  1.5\u00b0C  increase  in  temperature  and  4%  increase  in  precipitation  (the  median \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  Batch 1 towns: Amtali, Galachipa, Mathbaria, and Pirojpur. Batch 2 towns: Barguna, Bhola, Daulat Khan, and \nKalapara. Towns were selected based on their vulnerability, population size, density, and level of past investment.  \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.  \n4  DPHE will act on behalf of MLGRDC as co-executing agency for the water supply and sanitation components.  \n5  Government of Bangladesh.

The central and southwestern regions of the country are \nparticularly vulnerable. Cyclone Sidr in 2007 (a Category 5 storm with wind speed of 260 \nkilometers  per  hour)  resulted  in  economic  losses  of  $1.7  billion  (2.6%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct). The poor and women are disproportionately affected and have the lowest capacity to \ncope  with  losses.  There  is  a  high  demand  for  climate-resilient  infrastructure  and  disaster \npreparedness to improve the wellbeing of residents and reduce migration to larger cities.   \n \n5.  Coastal towns suffer from large infrastructure deficits and natural resource constraints \nthat exacerbate sensitivity to climate change. A shortage of drains and severe siltation and solid \nwaste build up result in severe flooding and extended water logging (lasting up to 7 days during \nmonsoon  rains).  Water  supply  suffers  from  (i)  low  access  to  piped  water,  (ii)  salinity \ncontamination of shallow and middle aquifers, and (iii) unsustainable groundwater extraction. \nFeasibility  study  surveys  found  that  residents  without  piped  water  supplies  who  rely  on \ncommunity pond sand filter systems pay as much as 2\u20134 times more for water of inferior quality \ncompared  to  similar  towns  with  piped  supplies. There  is  a  high  willingness to  pay  (up  to \n50%more) for improved services. While there is generally high coverage of household sanitation \n(up to 94% of households have toilets), there is no septage management or treatment systems, \nresulting  in  polluted  waterways  and  a  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  with  large \noutbreaks occurring after disasters.10 Emergency access roads are in poor condition, and most \ncyclone shelters are structurally unsafe as a result of extensive exposure to cyclones and poor \nmaintenance.  There  is  an  acute  need  for  new,  higher-capacity  multi-use  cyclone  shelters \nlocated in core urban areas accessible to poorer populations. It is critical that new investments \nare designed that consider climate change to manage the long-term costs of natural disasters \nand ensure investments deliver intended benefits. \n \n6.  The  high  vulnerability  of  coastal  towns  is  also  linked  to  poor  governance  and  low \nadaptive capacity.11 Urban planning is in its infancy and development controls are only now \nemerging. Many pourashavas lack established mechanisms for public participation, particularly \nin the allocation of municipal budgets. Low tax collection efficiency (on average 57% in coastal \ntowns) reflects outdated financial management practices, including limited computerization of \naccounts  and  billing  systems,  and  irregular  tax  assessments.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to \nstrengthen institutional capacity, public awareness, and knowledge management to complement \nphysical investments as part of an integrated approach for building climate change resilience.  \n \n7.  Performance-based  approach.  The  project  aims  to  incentivize  governance \nimprovement and build resilience by linking each stage of investment to demonstrated reforms, \nas proven highly effective in previous ADB urban projects in Bangladesh. The eight project \ntowns are divided into two batches of four, with each town entitled to two stages of investment \n(stages  1  and  2).12 Towns  will  receive  funding  under  each  stage  if  they  fulfill  agreed \n                                                \n9  World Bank. 2010.

A \nperformance evaluation committee will evaluate each pourashava. \n \n8.  Lessons. The project reflects the successful experience in governance-led investment \nthrough  performance-based  allocation  from  the  first  and  second  Urban  Governance  and \nInfrastructure Improvement (Sector) Projects.14 The project also reflects findings of downscaled \nclimate modeling from the technical assistance on Strengthening the Resilience of the Urban \nWater Supply, Drainage, and Sanitation to Climate Change in Coastal Towns.15  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project will be improved wellbeing in coastal towns. The outcome of \nthe project will be increased climate and disaster resilience in coastal towns benefiting the poor \nand women. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project will have the following outputs.  \n \n1.  Output 1: Improved climate-resilient municipal infrastructure  \n11.  Stage 1: Climate and disaster risk-reducing infrastructure. Priority infrastructure will \nfill  critical  deficits  to  strengthen  climate  and  disaster  resilience  and  include  the  design, \nrehabilitation, and construction of (i) drainage systems; (ii) cyclone shelters; (iii) water supply \nsystems; (iv) sanitation systems; (v) emergency access roads, bridges, and culverts; and (vi) \nsolid  waste  management  systems. 16 Infrastructure  will  be  designed  considering  climate \nprojections for the year 2040. The project will develop climate-resilient community infrastructure \nin poor, vulnerable areas as part of larger infrastructure contracts.17 Climate-resilient measures \nwill include, but are not limited to, increasing drainage capacity; raising infrastructure levels for \nroads, cyclone shelters, water and sanitation facilities; and identifying non-saline water sources. \nGroundwater sources will be prioritized as a least-cost option where salinity levels are within \ngovernment standards. A design consulting firm will screen all subprojects for climate resilience, \nand prepare all engineering designs, bidding, and safeguard documents.  \n \n12.  Stage 2: Local economic infrastructure. This component will support local economic \ndevelopment activities and will include the design, rehabilitation, and construction of (i) markets, \n(ii) bus terminals, (iii) boat landings, and (iv) commercially important roads. These investments \nwill also consider climate resilience in the planning and design stage.   \n \n \n                                                \n13  Performance criteria are in Appendix 5 of the Project Administration Manual, which is accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2. Towns not fulfilling criteria within the stipulated timeframe are dropped, and funds \nwill be reallocated.  \n14 ADB. 2008.

Output 2: Strengthened institutional capacity, governance, and awareness \n13.  Municipal  governance  and  service  delivery  improvements.  Capacity  building \nactivities under this subcomponent will focus on (i) strengthening municipal finance systems to \nimprove local revenues, (ii) enhancing citizen participation in pourashava planning and decision \nmaking  process,18 (iii)  strengthening  technical  capacity  and  institutional  arrangements  for \nimproved service delivery and O&M at the pourashava level, and (iv) promoting private sector \nparticipation in fecal sludge management.  \n \n14.  Non-structural  measures  to  reduce  climate  and  disaster  risk. Capacity building \nsupport will strengthen the ability of pourashavas to prepare and respond to climate-related \nrisks and disasters by (i) reviewing and updating the urban master plans, local building codes, \nand engineering design standards of LGED and DPHE to incorporate climate change and \ndisaster resilient measures; (ii) improving water safety planning and groundwater monitoring \nthrough the development of water safety plans and guidelines; and (iii) establishing disaster \nmanagement standing committees in each pourashava, and delivering appropriate technical \ntraining for the members of such committees.  \n \n15.  Public  awareness,  behavior  change,  and  community  mobilization.  Knowledge- \nbased awareness-raising activities will focus on (i) education and communication campaigns to \nraise public awareness of climate change and disaster-related risks and preparedness; waste \nreduction,  reuse  and  recycling;  and  the  links  between  water,  sanitation  and  hygiene;  (ii) \nlivelihood  training  programs  for  poor  households  targeting  women;  and  (iii)  community \nmobilization  to  enable  poor  communities  to  access  and  use  climate-resilient  infrastructure \n(under output 1). The institutional capacity-building consultants will support these activities.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Project management and administration supported \n16.  A project management and supervision consultant firm will be recruited to support  (i) \noverall project management, performance monitoring, and reporting; (ii) contract management \nincluding capacity development in e-procurement processes and procedures; (iii) quality control \nof engineering designs and construction supervision; and (iv) compliance with ADB safeguard \npolicies.  A  project  internal  audit  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  conduct  independent  and \nobjective third-party internal auditing and post-procurement review services.  \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n22.  Various technical options were examined to climate proof the design. All infrastructure \nunder the project will be screened on the basis of agreed technical selection criteria and will \nconsider climate projections for year 2040 in detailed designs.26 New water sources will be \nexplored\u2014from deep aquifers or upstream surface water systems\u2014to avoid salinity intrusion. \nPiped water systems will be introduced and/or expanded where needed to fill service gaps in \ncore urban areas. Power backup generators will be provided to ensure normal operation during \npower disruptions common during cyclones. Road construction materials will be selected that \nare resistant to high temperatures. To reduce flooding, excavation of existing drainage canals \nup to design depths coupled with new drains to provide adequate connectivity to secondary \ndrains  will  be  developed.  Improved  solid  waste  management  will  further  reduce  drainage \ncongestion. Non-structural measures\u2014such as updated urban master plans and guidance for \napplying  climate  resilience  to  building  codes,  and  strengthened  capacity  for  water  safety \nplanning and disaster management\u2014will ensure robust service delivery, planning, and disaster \npreparedness that consider the impacts of climate change.27  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis was conducted for subprojects for stage 1 \nin the four Batch 1 pourashavas only.28 Representative subprojects were analyzed to estimate \nthe viability of three scenarios: (i) the present situation without the project, (ii) investment without \nfuture climate resilience measures, and (iii) investment with future climate resilience measures. \nThe overall economic internal rate of return for Batch 1 pourashavas (stage 1) is 23.0%, with \nfuture  climate  resilience  measures.  The  subproject  economic  internal  rates  of  return  were \n                                                \n26 Technical subproject selection criteria are in the PAM (footnote 20). \n27 A summary of all climate resilience measures is in the Climate Change: Project Adaptation Report (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Batch 1, stage 2 and batch 2, stage 1 and 2 subprojects will be evaluated by the project management supervision \nconsultant economist once the project scope is defined. \n ", "8   \n14.0%\u201317.7%  for  water  supply;  14.2%\u201330.0%  for  sanitation;  18.1%\u201342.9%  for  drainage;29 \n20.3%\u201324.7%  for  roads;  21.1%\u201322.2%  for  bridges;  and  16.5%\u201335%  for  cyclone  shelters. \nSensitivity analysis confirms that all the subprojects are robust. The results are most likely \nunderestimated because some project benefits are not easily quantifiable and cumulative, and \nthus not included in this analysis (e.g., the impact of death and trauma from disaster events). \nThe feasibility survey indicates that willingness to pay is sufficient to meet O&M costs and debt \nservice, while the affordability analysis indicates the proposed water supply tariff increases are \neconomically and socially viable. \n \n24.  Financial  analysis.  The  financial  analysis  focused  on  the  capacity  of  batch  1 \npourashavas to pay O&M costs and service debt. The overall financial position of each sample \npourashava  is  projected  reflecting  incremental  revenue  and  expenditures.  The  tariffs  of \nrevenue-generating components (i.e., water supply and sanitation) are not set for full cost \nrecovery; however, by improving operational efficiency, adopting a tariff plan with increases \nevery 4 years, and increasing property tax collection efficiency, the pourashavas are expected \nto generate sufficient revenue to meet O&M costs and service debt to sustain infrastructure and \nservice delivery for all subprojects supported under the project. The financial projections show \nthat the water supply components will require a time-bound cross-subsidy in two out of three \nbatch 1 pourashavas receiving water supply investments; the respective pourashavas have the \ncapacity to cover these through general revenues. Loan covenants include requirements for \nintroduction of volumetric water tariffs to ensure financial viability, and a minimum cost-recovery \nratio. Performance criteria include a target for improving property tax collection efficiency rates \nto a minimum of 80%. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Bangladesh  has  implemented  key  governance  and  anticorruption  reforms,  including \nestablishing an independent Anti-Corruption Commission in 2004, and enacting the Right to \nInformation Act in 2009, the Whistleblower Protection Act in 2011, and the Money Laundering \nPrevention Act in 2012. A comprehensive national integrity strategy was adopted in 2012 to \naddress corruption holistically and strengthen governance institutions in a phased manner. The \nfinancial management assessment of LGED, DPHE, and sample batch 1 pourashavas indicated \nthat\u2014with  the  support  of  a  dedicated  financial  management  consultant  in  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), an accounts officer in the PMU, and a dedicated project accountant in \neach  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)\u2014there  will  be  adequate  financial  management \ncapabilities and support for project implementation. 30  The capacity of LGED\u2019s and pourashava \nfinance and accounting staff will be further strengthened through training programs conducted \nunder the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the LGED, DPHE, and pourashavas. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20).  \n \n26.  While LGED has proven experience in ADB procurement, local officials have limited \nexperience implementing large infrastructure projects. Procurement capacity assessments of \nsample  pourashavas  indicated  that  a  procurement  specialist  in  the  PMU  will  provide \npourashavas with adequate procurement support to implement the project. E-procurement will \nbe implemented for national competitive bidding (NCB) packages. Other measures to ensure \ntransparency include the presentation of detailed information on procurement at public meetings \nto supplement web-based disclosure. Capacity of PIU staff will be further strengthened through \n                                                \n29 The economic analysis for drainage includes the solid waste component. \n30 The financial management specialist will provide capacity support to both PMU and all PIUs. \n ", "9 \ntraining  programs  conducted  under  the  project,  including  e-procurement,  auditing,  quality \ncontrol, community participation, monitoring, reporting, and evaluation. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Poverty rates in coastal pourashavas are 50%, which exceeds the national average of \n31.5%.  The  poor  are  disproportionately  affected  by  climate  hazards  because  they  live  in \ntemporary structures in high risk areas (e.g., outside protective embankments), and have less \ncapacity  to  cope  with  disaster.  They  depend  directly  on  climate-sensitive  sectors  of  the \neconomy such as agriculture and fisheries. They have poor access to basic services, and suffer \nfrom high rates of waterborne diseases due to salinity and biological contamination, especially \nafter disasters. The project will mobilize community-based organizations to improve access to \nsafe drinking water and sanitation in poor communities. New cyclone shelters will be located in \npoor and vulnerable areas. The poor will benefit from targeted livelihood training programs and \nemployment  opportunities  associated  with  construction  activities.  Town-  and  ward-level \ncommittees formed under the project will involve the poor.  \n \n28.  Gender. The project is classified as a gender equity theme. The project will significantly \nbenefit women\u2019s safety during disasters by improving access and quality of cyclone shelters \nwith separately designed spaces for women. Women will be encouraged to play a major role in \ncommunity-based  organizations  and  town-  and  ward-level  committees  formed  in  each \npourashava. Special attention will be given to empowering women by building their technical \ncapacity and skills through targeted livelihood training, and participation in water- and sanitation-\nrelated programs, where women will take leadership positions in water safety planning activities. \nCore  labor  standards,  including  equal  wages  for  work  of  equal  value,  will  be  practiced. \nResources are allocated for implementation and monitoring of the project\u2019s gender action plan.31 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  The project is classified as category B for environmental safeguards, category B for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. Draft initial environmental \nexaminations  were  prepared  and  disclosed  for  sample  subprojects  in  batch  1  towns  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009) and government laws. Project \nlocations are located outside sensitive and protected areas, and any construction impacts will \nbe mitigated through implementation of environmental management plans that will form part of \ncontract documents. Draft resettlement plans were prepared and disclosed in accordance with \nthe ADB\u2019s SPS for sample subprojects in batch 1 towns. Impacts to 153 affected persons will \noccur as a result of 4.45 hectares of private land acquisition, and physical relocation of six \nresidential and business structures for drainage works. The project will not affect indigenous \npeoples. Significant safeguard impacts will be avoided in future subprojects, which will be \nguided  by  the  relevant  safeguard  frameworks,  and  monitored  as  part  of  the  semi-annual \nsafeguard monitoring reports. Consultants will support carrying out safeguards-related tasks.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4.32 The  integrated \nbenefits of the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n                                                \n31 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nBWDB  flood  control  systems  not  Loan covenant requires repair of BWDB flood control systems prior to \nimproved  reducing  effectiveness  of  contract award.
