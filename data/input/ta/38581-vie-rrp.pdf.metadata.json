The Project will assist \nthe Government to implement a comprehensive behavior change \ncommunication  (BCC)  action  plan,  including  mass  media  and \ncommunity outreach to effect behavior change and reduce the risk \nof HIV infection among youth (15\u201324 years). The Project will be \nimplemented nationally and in 15 provinces over 5 years. . \n   \nRationale  In March 2006, the Government of Vietnam noted that there were \nabout  104,000  reported  HIV/AIDS  cases  in  Viet  Nam.  It  is \nestimated  that  the  actual  number  of  cases  is  three  times  this \nfigure,  with  0.54%  national  prevalence  in  the  15\u201349-year  old \npopulation. These figures represent rapid, exponential growth that \nhas shown no signs of abating. Viet Nam\u2019s epidemic is largely \ndriven by injecting drug use but a growing number of infections \noccur  among  sex  workers.  The  clients  of  sex  workers  then \nbecome the bridge to the general community (through their wives \nor girlfriends and, through mother-to child transmission). \n \nYoung people between the ages of 15 and 24 years account for \nabout  40%  of  cases  and  are  a  key  target  group  for  focused \nprevention efforts. Young men and their risk-taking behavior (drug \nuse and unprotected sex with sex workers) are a driving force of \nthe epidemic. \n \nThe Government of Viet Nam has a national HIV/AIDS strategy \n(endorsed by the Prime Minister in 2004) that identifies behavioral \nchange information, education, and communication programs, as \nwell  as  harm  reduction,  as  priority  activities  for  HIV/AIDS \nprevention  and  control.  With  awareness  levels  already  high, \ninternational  best  practice  dictates  that  role  modeling  and \nintegrated  media  and  community-based  approaches  that \npersonalize knowledge are the appropriate next step in a learning \nand behavior change continuum. \n \nGrant financing is justified given that HIV/AIDS prevention is a \npublic good and highly cost-effective. ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  Consistent with the directions provided by the national HIV/AIDS \nstrategy,  the  Project  will  reduce  HIV  infection  risk  behaviors \namong youth aged 15\u201324. It should result in more than 34,000 \nHIV  infections  being  avoided  over  a  20-year  period.  This  will \nprovide  positive  social  and  economic  benefits,  including  the \navoidance of costs associated with reduced productivity and the \nprolonged periods of care and treatment needed by patients. \n \nComponent 1 activities will target leaders, policy development, \nand program integration, from the national to the community level, \nwith advocacy and support for youth programs. The outcome will \nbe  an  improved  policy  environment  for  a  youth  focus  in  the \nimplementation of a national HIV/AIDS strategy. \n \nComponent  2  activities  will  support  the  production  of  a  high-\nquality,  mass  media  behavior  change  communication  program \nfocused  on  youth  and  their  families.  The  program  will  include \ntelevision,  radio,  and  print  media  in  an  integrated,  reinforcing \npackage. The outcome will be improved knowledge in relation to \nHIV/AIDS risks and prevention and associated issues for youth, \nincluding  accepting  condom  use  as  normal,  and  the  effect  of \nharmful  gender  stereo-types  and  stigma  and  discrimination  on \npeople at high risk and on people already infected. \n \nComponent 3 comprises three subcomponents: (i) comprehensive \nharm  reduction  services  (including  the  provision  of  voluntary \ncounseling and testing, condoms, and needles) and the provision \nof information, and peer education in settings that are accessible \nto youth; (ii) peer education and life skills training for vulnerable \nyouth in industrial zones, tourism spots, universities and colleges \nwith migrant youth, and other settings; and (iii) primary prevention \nthrough  school-based  education  and  community  outreach  to \nparents on youth and HIV/AIDS issues. The outcome in project \nprovinces should be an increase in the proportion of youth with \naccess  to  services  and  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  new \ninfections. \n \nComponent 4 activities will support project management, capacity \nbuilding, and youth-focused monitoring and evaluation. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The Project is estimated to cost $26.7 million, including duties and \ntaxes. Of the total, $3.73 million or 14% is in foreign exchange \ncosts and $22.97 million equivalent or 86% represents the local \ncurrency costs. \n   \nGrant Financing Plan  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide a grant of $20 million from its \nSpecial  Funds  (Asian  Development  Fund  IX  Grants  Program), \nrepresenting 75% of the total project cost. The Government of Viet \nNam will provide counterpart funds totaling $6.7 million equivalent.", "  iii\n  Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total   % \nAsian Development Banka  20.00  75.00 \nGovernment    6.70  25.00 \nTotal  26.70  100.00 \na Asian Development Fund grant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nGrant Allocation and  A grant of $20 million will be provided from the Special Funds of \nTerms  ADB with terms and conditions in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The grant will be utilized until 31 December 2011. \n   \nEstimated Project  31 June 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Viet  Nam  Commission  for  Population,  Family  and  Children \n(VCPFC) \n   \nImplementation  The implementing agencies include several government entities, \nArrangements  and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) led by the respective \nProvincial  Committee  for  Population  Family  and  Children \n(PCPFC).  A  contracted  media  production  firm  will  implement \ncomponent 2. Contracted service delivery NGOs and civil society \nand mass organizations such as the Youth and Women\u2019s Unions \nwill  implement  component  3,  along  with  the  Department  of \nEducation  for  school-based  activities  and  the  PCPFC \ncollaborators parent-focused programs.  \n \nA  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  provide  technical  and \ncoordination support and will work under the guidance of a project \nsteering  committee  headed  by  the  minister  of  VCPFC.  Each \nprovince  will  establish  a  provincial  PMU  to  be  guided  by  the \nPCPFC. \n \nImplementation arrangements will ensure close collaboration and \ncoordination with the Viet Nam Administration for AIDS Control at \nthe central level and with its provincial equivalent, the provincial \nAIDS committee. \n   \nProcurement  All ADB-financed procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. \n   \n ", "iv   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. The Project will require \n54 person-months of international consulting services for capacity \nbuilding,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  youth  and  HIV/AIDS \npolicy  enhancement  and  360  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services. There will be single source selection of the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) for the provision of youth and \nHIV/AIDS policy expertise, given WHO\u2019s shared objectives and \nexperience of exceptional worth. An international media agency \nwill provide technical assistance for the mass media component. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will result in lower HIV infection rates and will benefit \nBeneficiaries  young people who would have been infected had they not been \neducated about behavioral options and given the resources to \nadopt  new  behaviors  (such  as  being  tested  for  HIV,  using \ncondoms, and not sharing needles). It is estimated that the Project \nwill result in the avoidance of more than 34,000 HIV infections \nover a 20-year period. The reduced risk of exponential growth if \ninfection rates are contained and the benefit of productive life will \nbenefit individuals, communities, and the Government.   \n \nThere  will  be  economic  benefits  from  reducing  the  losses  in \nincome incurred by the sick and their carers and from reducing the \npublic health costs of care and treatment for the ill. Benefits will be \ngreater  for  people  who  are  most  vulnerable  to  HIV  infection, \nincluding the poor, young women, members of ethnic minorities, \nmobile youth, and young people working in particular industries, \nsuch as tourism and transport.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  has  some  financial,  technical,  and  social  risks.  It \nrequires the timely provision of counterpart funds and a sustained \nGovernment  investment  in  programs  and  projects  that  target \nyouth. The PMU and contracted media agencies need to be able \nto address sensitive issues related to sexuality, drug use, stigma, \nand discrimination directly in the media materials in order to effect \nbehavior change. Materials need to be broadcast at times that \nmaximize audiences, especially for youth. Failure to realize these \nconditions will diminish the potential impact of the Project. Project \nimplementation  plans  and  assurances  have  been  designed  to \nreduce and mitigate these risks.  \n \n  The overall impact of the Project is dependent on people changing \ntheir  sexual  behavior  and  cultural  and  traditional  attitudes  to \nsexuality,  drug  use,  youth,  and  gender  relations.  Success  in \nchanging  sexual  practices  (e.g.,  condom  use),  community \nattitudes,  stigma,  and  discrimination  is  largely  dependent  on \nchanging  individual  attitudes.  Careful  research  and  planning \ncombined  with  programming  and  service  delivery  will  address \nthese risks. \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ngrant to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the HIV/AIDS Prevention among Youth Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In December 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved project preparatory \ntechnical assistance for the HIV/AIDS Prevention among Youth Project.1 The Government, \nrepresented by the Vietnam Commission for Population Family and Children (VCPFC), has \nagreed to a project design that emphasizes support for implementation of the Government\u2019s \nnational HIV/AIDS strategy.2 The Project includes a major mass media campaign targeted at the \nyouth to be complemented by a comprehensive program of activities and services focused on \nHIV/AIDS prevention for mainstream, vulnerable, and high-risk youth in 15 provinces. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Sector Background \n3.  Curbing the growth in the HIV/AIDS3 epidemic and mitigating the impact on individuals, \nfamilies, communities, and society, including the economic costs, has been given high priority \nby the Government of Viet Nam. It is also a priority for most governments in the region and \nglobally  (Appendix  2).  The  Government  is  firmly  committed  to  meeting  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) which include the target to \u201chave halted by 2015 and begun to \nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS\u201d (MDG 6, Target 7). While Viet Nam has made significant \nprogress toward achieving most of the MDGs, including those for poverty and child mortality, the \nprospect of achieving the MDG for HIV/AIDS remains elusive, as the number of new infections \ngrows annually and there is little sign of abatement. \n \n4.  According to a Government of Viet Nam report of March 2006, there are just over \n104,000 officially reported cases of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam. It is estimated the actual number is \nthree times this figure representing a national prevalence of 0.54% in the 15\u201349-year old \npopulation.4 These figures represent an exponential rate of growth in the number of infections \nthat has consistently exceeded official expectations. In 1995, there were fewer than 4,000 \nreported cases, but this had increased to estimated 40,000 new cases per year by 2005. In \n2001, the Ministry of Health (MOH) estimated that the actual number of cases at the end of \n2005 would be 197,000,5 but by March 2006 the estimate had grown to more than 310,000 (see \nfootnote 4).  \n \n5.  The majority of infections in Viet Nam occur in groups readily classified by their high-\nrisk behaviors including predominantly injecting drug users (IDUs) and sex workers. In mid-\n2004, it was estimated that IDUs accounted for 57% of newly reported cases. Other reported \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Hanoi. \n ", "2   \ncategories of HIV cases were sex workers (3%), tuberculosis patients (4.5%), army conscripts \n(1.5%) and blood donors (0.7%). More than 30% of reported cases are classified as \u201cother\u201d or \n\u201cunknown\u201d, although it is predicted that they are likely to be IDUs and sex workers. Men who \nhave sex with men are also a group at risk but there is little information on their numbers or \nbehaviors. It is unlikely they play a significant role in the growth of the epidemic. \n \n6.  The HIV prevalence rate among IDUs increased from 18% in 1996 to over 30% in \n2002, while among sex workers the increase was from 0.6% in 1994 to 5.2% in 2002. Data from \nsmall studies have shown 25% of sex workers in Ho Chi Minh City and 15% in Hanoi to be HIV \npositive. All provinces have reported HIV/AIDS cases but more than 50% of cases are in ten \nprovinces, including Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Quang Ninh, and Hai Phong.  \n \n7.  Young people aged 15\u201324 constitute approximately 20% of Viet Nam\u2019s population. The \nproportion  of  HIV  infections  occurring  among  young  people  has  grown  steadily.  In  1994, \napproximately 10% of newly reported cases were among people aged 15\u201324 years; 5 years \nlater the figure was approximately 40%. Young men and their risk-taking behaviors (drug use, \nalcohol, and unsafe sex) are the driving force of Viet Nam\u2019s epidemic. A recent survey of \nVietnamese youth found that 50% of sexually active young men had their first sexual encounter \nin a hotel, likely to have been with a sex worker.6 \n \n8.  A disturbing development in Viet Nam\u2019s HIV/AIDS epidemic is the evidence that the \ndisease is spreading into the general population. The infection rate among pregnant women \nattending antenatal clinics is an internationally recognized indicator of this movement. From \n1995 to 2002, this rate increased more than tenfold from 0.03% to 0.4%. Moreover, HIV sentinel \nsurveillance data have shown the rate to be up to 1% in the urban areas of An Giang and Hai \nPhong. Such infection rates are indicative of the spread of infection between IDUs and sex \nworkers, from sex workers to married men, and from men to their wives and girlfriends.  \n \n2.  The Response to HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam \n9.  The Government of Viet Nam\u2019s first official response to HIV/AIDS was in 1987 with the \nestablishment of a \u201csubcommittee\u201d for AIDS prevention. Since then, the status of the institutions \nresponsible has been progressively upgraded and strengthened, with accompanying policy \ndevelopments. The first government directive was in 1995 from the Communist Party\u2019s Central \nCommittee  on  the  work  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  control.  In  May  1995,  the  Standing \nCommittee of the IXth National Assembly adopted an ordinance on HIV/AIDS prevention and \ncontrol that provided the legal basis for HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities. Since then, \nmore than 29 legal documents have been issued by the Government, including a decree from \nthe Prime Minister in February 2003 emphasizing the need for a multisectoral response.  \n \n10.  National  Strategy.  In  March  2004  the  Prime  Minister  signed  Decision  No. \n36/2004/QD-TTg approving the National Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control till 2010 \nwith a Vision to 2020 (footnote 2) The overall objective of this national HIV/AIDS strategy is to \ncontrol the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among the general population to below 0.3% by 2010 and \nto reduce the adverse impacts of HIV/AIDS on social and economic development.  \n \n11.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy  has  been  internationally  recognized  as \ncomprehensive and specific in its targets, while acknowledging the key issues that underlie the \ngrowing epidemic and the steps needed to control it. In particular, the strategy has noted the \nimportance of harm reduction, incorporating (i) condom use and safe injecting (for IDUs); (ii) the \n                                                 \n6  MOH and WHO. 2005. Survey of Assessment of Vietnamese Youth (SAVY). Hanoi. ", "    3 \npriority of care and treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); (iii) the importance of \ncomprehensive  leadership  and  the  involvement  of  all  aspects  of  society,  including  social, \nreligious, and community organizations; and (iv) the need to fight stigma and discrimination as a \nhumanitarian measure and as a means of controlling the ongoing spread of the virus. The \nstrategy nominates four priority activities for HIV/AIDS prevention and control:  \n \n(i)  intensifying behavioral change information, education, and communication (IEC), \nand collaborating with other related programs to reduce HIV/AIDS transmission; \n(ii)  stepping up harm-reduction intervention measures; \n(iii)  promoting counseling, care, and treatment for HIV/AIDS-infected people; and \n(iv)  strengthening program management, supervision, and evaluation capabilities. \n \n12.  In addition to the four priority activities, the strategy outlines nine programs of action: (i) \nbehavioral change communication; (ii) harm reduction; (iii) care and support for PLWHA; (iv) \nsurveillance, monitoring, and evaluation; (v) access to treatment; (vi) prevention of mother-to-\nchild transmission; (vii) management and treatment of other sexually transmitted infections \n(STIs); (viii) blood transfusion safety; and (ix) capacity building and international cooperation. \nThe specifics of these programs are being finalized by the Government and to date have been \nlargely driven by the large funding agency projects. MOH has indicated that the proposed ADB \nproject would become a key plank in the first program. \n \n13.  Youth. The national HIV/AIDS strategy explicitly recognizes the situation of youth, and \nnotes  the  limitations  of  past  programs  and  their  failure  to  integrate  with  comprehensive \nreproductive health care programs. Street children, working young people, school dropouts, and \nyoung people from ethnic minorities are explicitly recognized as being at risk and needing \ntargeted intervention measures, including life skills training, access to services, support, and \ncare. The strategy calls for policies that mobilize well-known people and leaders to participate in \nHIV/AIDS prevention and control and to set examples for the community, especially young \npeople. It emphasizes the need to intensify behavioral change IEC (i) for community groups that \nspecifically include young people; (ii) for services that attract young people in order to efficiently \nmanage STIs and provide reproductive health care and counseling services; and (iii) to link IEC \nactivities to these services with a specific goal of attracting young people.  \n \n14.  Institutional Structures. The Government has worked to strengthen the institutional \ncapacity for addressing HIV/AIDS and, in particular, for implementing the activities outlined in \nthe national HIV/AIDS strategy. The MOH is responsible for coordinating implementation of the \nstrategy. In August 2005, the Viet Nam Administration of AIDS Control (VAAC) was created \nfrom the former Department of Preventive Medicine and HIV/AIDS Control in MOH to bring a \nrenewed  and  higher  level  of  commitment  to  HIV/AIDS  programs.  The  national  HIV/AIDS \nstrategy envisages a role for all government agencies according to \u201ctheir assigned functions and \ntasks  and  their  own  characteristics\u201d.  The  Vietnam  Commission  for  Population,  Family  and \nChildren  (VCPFC)  is  proposing  to  lead  a  comprehensive  program  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention \nactivities  focused  on  youth  and  their  families.  Other  institutions  mentioned  in  the  national \nHIV/AIDS strategy with special responsibilities in relation to the response to HIV/AIDS include (i) \nthe people\u2019s committees of the provinces (for ensuring resource commitments); (ii) the Ministry \nof Education and Training (for integrating HIV/AIDS prevention and control knowledge into the \ncurricula of universities, colleges, and schools); (iii) the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and \nSocial Affairs (for operating the centers providing rehabilitation services to drug users and sex \nworkers); and (v) Vietnam Television (VTV), Voice of Vietnam (VOV) radio, and the Vietnam \nNews Agency (for broadcasting mass media materials). The strategy also mentions the role of \n ", "4   \nsociopolitical mass organizations such as the Youth Union and Women\u2019s Union in implementing \nthe strategy.  \n \n15.  A National HIV/AIDS Law. In 2006, the Government is expected to adopt a new \ncomprehensive law on HIV/AIDS. The VAAC in the MOH, as the lead agency for this law-\nmaking  process,  has  consulted  widely  in  preparing  the  legislation,  including  with  the \ninternational community. The draft (as of March 2006) includes provisions for protecting the \nrights of PLWHA, fighting stigma and discrimination, and strengthening the responsibilities of \ngovernment institutions, society, and families. Laws play an important role in facilitating the \nimplementation of programs and strategies in Viet Nam, so the passage of the law will be an \nimportant step in facilitating the implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategy. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n16.  Rapid Economic Development and Social Change. In the past 10 years, Viet Nam \nhas made impressive progress in fighting poverty, with poverty incidence falling from 58% in \n1993 to 24% in 2004 and nearly 60% of households moving out of poverty.7 However, economic \ngrowth has been uneven and concentrated in large cities and the river deltas, and the rate of \npoverty reduction has slowed in recent years. Viet Nam also has a growing population of young \npeople, with just over 50% of the population under the age of 25 years. Young people are \nuniquely affected by the rapidly changing economic conditions. With working and social lives \nand expectations largely different from those of their parents, they potentially face issues that \nthey are not prepared for, or that their parents are poorly equipped to help them with. The \nbehaviors and social conditions that fuel the HIV/AIDS epidemic are among these. \n \n17.  Migration.  Accompanying  Viet  Nam\u2019s  rapid  but  uneven  economic  growth  and  the \nyoung population profile have been the high rates of migration\u2014internal, spontaneous, regional, \nand often temporary or repeated a number of times. Studies have found that approximately 37% \nof the population have migrated at least once in their lives and more than half the internal \nmigration has been to the large urban centers, particularly Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. More \nwomen than men migrate and, in the late 1990s, it was estimated that more than half the \ninternal migrants were less than 25 years of age, demonstrating the pull of the rapidly growing \nindustrial zones, where factory employment in industries, such as textiles, is increasingly on \noffer. By nature of their social disconnection, migrant youth are known to be more vulnerable to \nadopting high-risk behaviors in relation to HIV/AIDS.  \n \n18.  Gender and HIV/AIDS. Recognizing the different risks, behaviors, and sociocultural \nsituations of men and women in relation to HIV/AIDS is critical for understanding the epidemic \nand  mounting  an  effective  response.  Girls  and  women  are  physically  more  vulnerable  to \ninfection. Economic and social disempowerment means women are more likely to be involved in \nsex work and to be unable to protect themselves through condom use from infection. Social \nstructures  and  cultural  values  that  to  some  extent  promote  and  condone  multiple  sexual \npartners for men, including married men, and the use of sex workers, make a woman\u2019s marital \nstatus a risk factor for infection. As wives, women are vulnerable to infection, as they are \ngenerally powerless to insist that their husbands practice safe sex.  Furthermore, as mothers or \n                                                 \n7  Measured using the international standard for the poverty line comprising essential food expenditure for standard \nhuman energy intake (2,100 calories/capita/day) and nonfood expenditure equivalent to 2/3 of food expenditure \n(Reference: Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. 2005. Viet Nam Achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Hanoi). ", "    5 \nwives, women are most commonly the carers or financial supporters for those infected with \nHIV/AIDS and, as such, experience an uneven share of the financial and physical burdens. \n \n19.  It is equally important to understand and address the role that men play in the spread \nof the epidemic. Vietnamese men are more likely to use drugs and to visit sex workers and to \nmake the decisions regarding condom use in their relations with sex workers, casual partners, \ngirlfriends, and wives. Social activities outside the home frequently involve alcohol which is \nclosely  associated  with  high-risk  behavior.  Men  are  also  more  likely  to  be  identified  as \nunemployed and to work in high-risk settings such as construction sites.  \n \n20.  Stigma  and  Discrimination.  Stigma  and  discrimination  against  those  infected  or \nengaged in the high-risk behaviors that lead to infection play an insidious role in the spread of \nHIV/AIDS. Where there is stigma and discrimination people are unlikely to seek testing to \nascertain their infection status or other services that reduce their risk of infecting others. Stigma \nand discrimination often stem from poor or incorrect knowledge about the spread of HIV/AIDS. \nIn Viet Nam, the association of HIV/AIDS with the Government\u2019s \u201csocial evils\u201d policy (that \nincorporates drug use and prostitution) exacerbates stigma and discrimination, even though a \ngrowing number of those infected will have no direct association with these behaviors (e.g., \nwomen infected by their husbands, children of infected women). Stigma and discrimination \nagainst those infected, particularly in areas of employment and access to health care, have \nbeen reported and they often extend to family members. \n \n21.  HIV/AIDS and Poverty. HIV/AIDS and poverty are inextricably linked. Poor people are \nmore likely to be vulnerable or disempowered to protect themselves from the high-risk behaviors \nthat lead to infection (e.g., migration, unemployment, and sex work) while people who become \ninfected face an increased risk of falling into poverty along with their families. A study in Viet \nNam has shown that the health care expenditure of households with a PLWHA is 13 times \ngreater than the average household\u2019s health spending.8 The same study found that 18% of \nPLWHAs experience reduced income when their status became known, while 50% gave up \nwork, either because of disability due to the illness or because of stigma and discrimination. \nPeople who care for the sick, usually women, are also at increased risk of poverty because of \nunemployment and associated costs. At a macro level, international experience shows that \npoverty improvement rates will slow in countries with growing epidemics. \n \n22.  Youth and HIV/AIDS. Young people represent the reservoir from which those most \nlikely to become vulnerable and adopt high-risk behaviors will come. Strategies for targeting the \nattitudes and behaviors of young people\u2014whether for commercial or social purposes\u2014are \nunique and evidence from a range of sectors show they can be effectively developed for high \nimpact. This is the challenge and rationale for targeting youth in HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.  \n \n23.  In order to target youth for HIV/AIDS prevention effectively, it is important to distinguish \nbetween the different situations of young people and their risk of HIV/AIDS infection. While an \noverall goal of improving knowledge for behavior change will be the same for all groups, the \nspecific objectives and approaches will differ according to the characteristics of subgroups, their \nsituations and behaviors. The three groups identified for programming purposes are as follows.  \n \n(i)  Mainstream.  Those  that  could  become  vulnerable  or  high-risk.  They  are  in \nschool  or  employed  with  a  reasonable  salary  and  have  good  family  and \ncommunity support structures and social connectedness. The challenge with this \ngroup is to identify and reinforce the \u201cprotective\u201d factors that reduce their overall \n                                                 \n8  UNDP. 2004. Impact of HIV/AIDS on Household Vulnerability and Poverty in Viet Nam. Hanoi. \n ", "6   \nlifetime HIV/AIDS risk profile. As with many public health interventions, primary \nprevention for this group would have significant economic benefits, as the cost of \ninterventions is relatively low.  \n(ii)  Vulnerable. Those in a situation that makes them vulnerable to adopting high-\nrisk behaviors. It includes school dropouts, the unemployed or poorly employed, \nmigrant youth, youth living in poverty, and homeless youth. Particular industries \nsuch as tourism, shipping, and construction are particularly attractive to young \npeople, yet they can place them in situations where they are more likely to adopt \nhigh-risk behaviors.  \n(iii)  High-risk. Those already engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners \nand/or sex workers and/or injecting drug users who share needles. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n24.  Approaches to HIV prevention in Viet Nam have been largely based on IEC that \nprovides general awareness information for general audiences, rather than targeted messaging \nfor behavior change in specific groups. The IEC approach has led to high levels of awareness \nand some knowledge about HIV transmission, although this is often incomplete or incorrect. \nWith high levels of awareness and knowledge having been achieved, international experience \nshows that, at this stage in the continuum of knowledge development, the approach needs to \nchange to a focus on IEC that promotes attitudinal and behavior change among the target \ngroups (youth) and their social environment (family, teachers, and community leaders). To date, \na long-term, national behavior change communication (BCC) program for HIV/AIDS prevention \nhas not been implemented in Viet Nam. \n \n25.  Effective BCC should be based on research that identifies the obstacles and motivators \nto behavior change among the target audience. For HIV/AIDS prevention, messages need to be \ntargeted at vulnerable youth in ways that motivate individuals to consider and change their own \nbehaviors and attitudes. The \u201center-educate\u201d model has been developed and practiced for \nHIV/AIDS programs in several international settings and has had positive impact evaluation \nresults (Appendix 3). Combining \u201centertainment\u201d with \u201ceducation\u201d, the approach aims to attract \nand hold the attention of the audience by engaging its emotions while enhancing knowledge and \nskills so that informed choices can be made.  \n \n26.  Other Funding and International Agency Programs. There are currently four large \nHIV/AIDS programs supported by international agencies in Viet Nam:  \n(i)  the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID), in \nassociation  with  Norwegian  Aid  and  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  have \nprovided financing and technical support for a program focused on harm reduction, \nmanagement, and care of STIs;  \n(ii)  financing from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global \nFund), is directed towards care and support for PLWHA, testing, and prevention of \nmother-to-child transmission;  \n(iii)  the United States\u2019 President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) provides  \nfinancing for HIV treatment as well targeted programs for high-risk behaviors; and  \n(iv)  a  World  Bank  project  is  focused  on  harm  reduction,  rehabilitation,  care,  and \ntreatment for IDUs and sex workers with an extensive program of activities planned \nfor two cities and 18 provinces.  \n \n27.  There are also many HIV/AIDS activities supported and/or implemented by bilateral \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs) underway in Viet Nam, but most are relatively small, \ntheir activities take place in a few provinces, and are they tend to target groups with high-risk ", "    7 \nbehaviors (e.g., IDUs and sex workers). More information on these programs is provided in \nAppendix 4. While many of these projects contain some BCC activities, none has a specific \nyouth  focus\u2014a  gap  that  has  been  recognized  by  the  Government  and  technical  support \nagencies such as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in their reviews \nof current programs in Viet Nam. \n \n28.  The  Funding  Gap.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy  identifies  the  need  to \nmobilize more funding sources for HIV/AIDS prevention and control and estimates that annual \nexpenditure  by  2010  should  be  approximately  $300  million.  The  Government\u2019s  budget  for \nHIV/AIDS prevention programs in 2003 was $4.4 million. This had risen to $5.6 million in 2005 \nbut remained well short of the amount needed. The annual value of funding agency programs is \ndifficult to estimate, given the dynamic nature of the sector. However, it is recognized that \ncurrent and proposed funding agency assistance will not fill the gap between estimated needs \nand government resources. The Government\u2019s budget in 2006 is about $6 million and it is \nestimated that funding agency resources from the four major projects (DFID, the Global Fund, \nPEPFAR, and the World Bank) will contribute about $40 million. At $20 million, or $4 million per \nyear for 5 years, the ADB-financed project can make a contribution to filling the remaining \nfunding gap. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Strategic Directions for HIV/AIDS.9 In 2005, ADB adopted its first strategic \nframework. This provides guidance on assisting ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) to \nfight HIV/AIDS. The framework states that goal of ADB\u2019s activities will be to support DMCs to \nachieve Target 7 of MDG 6: \u201cto have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of \nHIV/AIDS\u201d. It notes that ADB will pursue this goal with the objective of mitigating the potential \nimpact of HIV/AIDS on social development and poverty reduction. Three priority areas of action \nare identified: (i) support to strengthen the capacity and role of regional leaders in addressing \nHIV/AIDS; (ii) capacity building at the country and regional levels to address HIV/AIDS; and (iii) \nHIV/AIDS interventions that target the poor and vulnerable. It is on this basis that ADB now \nplans HIV/AIDS-related projects and technical assistance for its DMCs.  \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Opportunity. It is clearly understood that the poor and almost poor are more \nvulnerable  to,  and  affected  economically  by,  HIV/AIDS  infection.  The  prevention  programs \ndisproportionately benefit the poor, so there is a clear case for ADB attention. Moreover, with \nthe availability of grant funding for HIV/AIDS and experience in Viet Nam, particularly with \nseveral health and HIV/AIDS projects, there is an important and appropriate opportunity for ADB \nto contribute to implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategy and to reduce the burden of \ndisease caused by HIV/AIDS. This proposed Project complements the activities of current ADB \nprojects such as the Regional Communicable Disease Control Project10 and builds on the \nexperience of previous projects such as the Community Action for Preventing HIV/AIDS funded \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR).11 The proposal to target youth is in line with \nADB\u2019s strategic framework and fills an identified gap in the support available for the national \nHIV/AIDS strategy and for Viet Nam\u2019s achievement of its HIV/AIDS-related development goal.12 \n \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2005.

Lessons \n31.  The  challenge  of  effectively  targeting  youth  for  HIV/AIDS  and  health  promotion \ngenerally has attracted increasing attention as the economic benefits of healthy youth are \nrecognized. Analyses show that successful approaches include the following common features: \n(i)  ensure youth have access to comprehensive health education and reproductive \nhealth services (including voluntary counseling and testing for HIV/AIDS), that \nare available where and when youth will access them;  \n(ii)  target parents, teachers, and leaders who influence young people, since youth \nact more responsibly and develop self-esteem when such adults offer good role \nmodels, affirming relationships and safe environments;  \n(iii)  mobilize  the  education  system  to  become  a  vehicle  for  a  comprehensive \nprevention education programs for school-age youth; \n(iv)  integrate HIV/AIDS prevention messages into a range of venues frequented by \nyouth including clubs, religious groups, sports, and workplaces; \n(v)  address gender disparities by improving opportunities for girls\u2019 education and \nemployment as well as by addressing concepts of masculinity that lead young \nmen to risk behaviors; and   \n(vi)  open dialogue on sensitive issues so that adults and youth work together on \nissues of sexuality, sexual health education, sexual violence and abuse, gender \nroles, and cultural practices in culturally acceptable ways. \n \n32.  International  funding  agency  assistance  for  HIV/AIDS  in  Viet  Nam  has  increased \nrapidly in recent years and, while no major project has been completed and evaluated, some \nkey lessons have started to emerge. Until the development of this proposed Project, all major \nprojects have worked with MOH which has centralized and, at times, slowed implementation. \nThe  Government  has  started  to  address  this  limitation  by  upgrading  the  status  of  the \nadministration within MOH (creating the VAAC) and by promoting funding agency support for \nHIV/AIDS  through  other  Government  ministries  and  bodies.  Attention  to  the  capacity  of \nexecuting and implementing agencies is critical for effective and timely project implementation. \nMost international assistance has focused on high-risk behaviors and groups. While scale-up \nand replication of efforts is widely called for, without information and capacity it is difficult to do \nmore on these fronts at this stage. \n \n33.  ADB  has  experience  with  several  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  focused  on \nHIV/AIDS prevention in Viet Nam and the Mekong region. Lessons learned from these projects \ninclude (i) that HIV/AIDS control is a dynamic sector that requires multisectoral approaches and \ninterdisciplinary  collaboration;13 (ii)  that  NGOs  can  play  an  important  role  in  facilitating \ncommunity  involvement;14 (ii)  that  participatory  processes  take  time  to  develop;15 (iii)  that \neducation can play an important role in changing attitudes and altering practices; and (iv) that \nmultifaceted media programs improve dissemination.16 The JFPR-supported project (footnote 9) \nin particular provided lessons on the importance of comprehensive approaches to HIV/AIDS \nprevention at the decentralized, provincial level. \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2002.

ADB also has considerable experience in the health sector in Viet Nam and has \nlearned important lessons about designing and implementing effective projects. The need for a \nstrong,  proactive,  partner  agency  is  clear.  It  is  important  to  understand  and  work  with \ngovernment procedures and integrate them into project design and implementation. High-quality \ntechnical assistance in the form of consultants can provide useful support for efficient project \nimplementation.  Project  design  should  account  for  decentralized  governance  with  the \nappropriate division of actions between central and local authorities. ADB experience elsewhere \nin the health sector demonstrates that government investment in national strategies and master \nplans (such as the national HIV/AIDS strategy) is indicative of significant national ownership. \nProjects should align their objectives to existing national priorities and take advantage of the \nimportant consensus-building process that goes into preparing government strategies. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n35.  The project design is based on an extensive review of the needs, current portfolio of \nfunding agency assistance, and identified gaps in the context of the national HIV/AIDS strategy. \nThe Project was developed through extensive consultation with the VCPFC, MOH, provincial \nauthorities, and development partners. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n36.  The ultimate goal of the Project is to help Viet Nam achieve target 7 of MDG 6: to have \nhalted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS. To achieve this, the Project aims \nto reduce the HIV/AIDS infection risk among young people by assisting the Government to \nimplement a comprehensive youth-focused behavior change communication program. More \nspecifically, the Project seeks to (i) increase condom use, especially for high-risk sex; (ii) \nincrease the proportion of young people identifying a formal source of condoms; (iii) increase \nthe proportion of young people 15\u201324 years of age with comprehensive correct knowledge of \nHIV/AIDS; and (iv) reduce needle-sharing among IDUs in targeted provinces. \n \n37.  A comprehensive and youth-focused mass media campaign is the centerpiece of the \nProject. Incorporating television, radio, and print media, the campaign will aim to reduce risk and \nprevent infection for youth and their families. The campaign will be complemented by activities \nfocused on leadership support for HIV/AIDS prevention with a youth focus, as proposed under \nthe national HIV/AIDS strategy, as well as a comprehensive program of community-based \nactivities at the provincial level. Provincial activities will include services for youth in high-risk \nsituations (drug use and sex work) as well as information campaigns focused on youth who are \nvulnerable by nature of their work or personal circumstances (e.g., migrants, unemployed, \nemployed  in  the  growing  industrial  zones).  Province-based  activities  will  also  include  a \ncommunication  program  targeted  at  families,  particularly  parents, with  the  goal  of  creating \nhealthy  environments  for  youth  where  they  can  receive  support  that  will  reduce  their  HIV \nvulnerability. Leadership and community-focused activities will all be based on, and aligned \nwith, the mass media campaign messages to enhance resonance and effectiveness. \n \nB.  Outputs \n38.  The Project is designed to deliver four specific outputs: (i) a more effective policy \nenvironment  for  a  youth  focus  in  implementing  the  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy;  (ii)  more \nknowledge sharing in relation to HIV/AIDS risks and prevention and associated issues for youth; \n(iii) increased access by youth to HIV harm reduction and prevention education programs in \nproject provinces; and (iv) a stronger capacity of VCPFC to monitor and evaluate progress in \n ", "10   \ndelivering the outputs, and to design and implement programs to continue building its capacity. \nIn line with these outputs, the scope of the Project is divided into the following four components. \n \n1.  Leadership and Strategy Support \n39.  The Project will support targeted research and advocacy to leaders at all levels on \nyouth issues, youth participation mechanisms, and the mainstreaming of youth issues into \npolicy, projects, and service providers. Advocacy activities will target a broad range of leaders, \nincluding party and government officials from national, provincial, and community levels, to \nincrease their awareness and support for youth issues in relation to HIV/AIDS prevention and \nthe overall implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategy. Specific activities will include (i) \nsupport for the second Survey Assessment of Vietnamese Youth (SAVY), which follows the first \nsurvey in 2003, and other studies, together with dissemination workshops; (ii) the development \nand dissemination of materials targeted at leaders on youth issues; (iii) policy maker forums and \nadvocacy meetings at the community level; (iv) support for the participation of youth in national \nand international conferences and workshops; (v) planning workshops with local authorities and \npartners  to  support  the  integration  of  youth  issues  into  a  community  programs;  and  (vi) \ncommune outreach programs by the VCPFC and its provincial partners. The second SAVY will \nprovide valuable data on a range of issues relevant to the Project. There will be a concerted \neffort to support outreach activities that facilitate integration of the mass media messages and \nyouth themes across other relevant funding agency and government projects and programs. \n \n2.

Component 2 will focus on the production of a national mass media behavior change \ncommunication (BCC) program focused on youth with the aim of effecting changes to personal \nbehaviors and attitudes in order to reduce the risk of HIV/AIDS infection. The Project will \nsupport  the  development  and  production  of  a  television  drama  series  that  utilizes  the \n\u201center(tain)-educate\u201d  approach  to  behavior  change.17 The  drama  series  will  be  broadcast \nnationally, free-to-air on VTV during the prime viewing period, with at least one repeat show \nbroadcast per week.18 The series will run over 3 years and facilitate the mechanism of role-\nmodeling, which is a best-practice approach to promoting behavior change where there is \nalready a high level of awareness of the issue at hand (in this case HIV/AIDS).  \n \n41.  This drama series will complemented and supported by radio phone-in programs to be \nbroadcast nationally, free-to-air on VOV radio after each TV broadcast in order to provide \nimmediate feedback on the interpretation and assimilation of messages and the opportunity for \ninteractive dialogue for youth concerned about issues raised. The Project will also support \ncomplementary, youth-focused documentaries, television and radio community message spots \n(footnote 17), and materials for the print media (newspapers, popular youth magazines, etc.).  \n \n42.  All  materials  will  be  based  on  comprehensive,  audience-based  research.  The \nentertainment target will be people of all ages, with specific messages to be targeted at young \npeople and their families, community members, and other role models. Messages will aim to \nenhance factors that protect against vulnerability and high-risk behavior and to increase the \nlikelihood of harm reduction behaviors being adopted (e.g., condom use). In addition, the role \n                                                 \n17 More than 86% of Vietnamese youth watch TV at least once a week and 50% on a daily basis, and most identify \nTV as a key source of information on reproductive health issues. \n18 Details of the TV and radio broadcast agreements covering the timing of broadcasts and costs of community \nmessage spots will be finalized during project implementation, based on Government regulations and recovery of \ncost rates established by the Government. ", "    11 \nmodeling  and  messaging  will  aim  to  reduce  the  stigma  and  discrimination,  and  gender \nstereotypes, associated with HIV/AIDS risk.  \n \n3.  Community-Based HIV/AIDS Prevention Resources for Youth \n43.  The Project will support NGOs and mass organizations to implement a program of \nprovince-based, youth-focused activities, including community-based advocacy, peer education, \nlife skills training; and improved access to harm-reduction services at the provincial level. This \ncomponent  is  divided  into  three  subcomponents  that  focus  on  different  groups  of  youth \ndepending on their risk profile: (i) youth in high-risk situations (e.g., IDUs, sex workers, and \nclients of sex workers); (ii) vulnerable youth (e.g., because of their migrant, education, or \nemployment or economic status); and (iii) mainstream youth (who may currently be at low risk, \nbut whose status can be protected and strengthened). NGOs and mass organizations such as \nthe Youth and Women\u2019s Unions will be engaged as implementing agencies because of their \nability to reach youth in community settings effectively, especially those at risk, marginalized, or \nstigmatized. All messages and materials will be based on, and linked to, the themes and \ncharacters developed for the media campaign.  \n \n44.  Fifteen provinces have been selected for this component, based on a range of criteria \nrelated to youth, HIV/AIDS, poverty, and capacity (Appendix 5).19 Each nominated province will \nprepare an action plan that assesses the particular characteristics of the province\u2019s geography, \npopulation, economic status, and other factors that might affect youth vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. \nA summary of a sample action plan for Phu Tho province is in Appendix 6. \n \na.  Harm Reduction Outreach Services \n45.  This subcomponent targets youth in high-risk situations. It will support comprehensive \nharm  reduction  services  that  provide  condoms,  clean  needles  (for  IDUs),  and  voluntary \ncounseling and testing (VCT) services for early detection and associated behavior change. VCT \nservices will be linked to, and supported by, the local Department of Health. Services will be \nprovided in locations, and at times, that are youth-friendly, especially to those engaging in high-\nrisk  behaviors,  including  IDUs,  sex  workers,  and  those  who  use  sex  workers.  This \nsubcomponent  will  support  peer  education  programs  that  reach  out  to  youth  in  high-risk \nenvironments. NGOs will be contracted to implement this subcomponent. \n \nb.  HIV Prevention for Vulnerable Youth \n46.  The focus of this subcomponent will be targeted BCC and interpersonal communication \n(IPC)  interventions,  including  life  skills  training  and  peer  education,  through  worksites  and \nvocational training or job-recruitment centers, in industrial zones and other identified youth-\nfocused  locations.  Programs  will  use  the  IPC  materials  that  are  aimed  at  changing  the \nknowledge, attitudes and practices of vulnerable youth. NGOs will be contracted to implement \nthe peer-education and training activities. \n \nc.  Primary Prevention for Youth and Families \n47.  Life  skills  training  for  mainstream  youth  (i.e.,  those  not  at  immediate  risk  of  HIV \ninfection) and their families on issues surrounding and related to HIV/AIDS risk behaviors will be \nprovided  under  this  subcomponent.  It  will  support  school  programs,  including  curriculum \n                                                 \n19 The provinces are (i) Ha Noi, Ha Tay, Bac Ninh, Phu Tho, and Quang Ninh (phase 1); and (ii) Hai Duong, Dien \nBien, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Binh Duong, Long An, Dong Thap, Can Tho, and Ba Ria-Vung Tau \n(phase 2). \n ", "12   \ndevelopment with the Ministry of Education and Training, and community-based collaborator \noutreach programs for families, in particular the parents of young people. These are primary \nprevention measures aimed at building the resilience of youth and families and enhancing their \ncapacity to protect themselves, create supportive environments, and make choices that mean \nthat high-risk behaviors are avoided. The messages will specifically aim to address the stigma, \ndiscrimination, and gender norms associated with HIV/AIDS, as well as other common belief \nstructures that affect risk (such as those associated with condom use). NGOs will conduct train-\nthe-trainer programs to school personnel and community collaborator networks. \n \n4.  Project Management, Capacity Building, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n48.  The  Project  will  help  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  central  and  provincial \nimplementation  units  through  targeted  training  activities.  The  component  will  support  the \nestablishment  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  structures  that  are  complementary  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s national HIV/AIDS monitoring and evaluation framework. The Project will also \nsupport the development of youth-focused indicators for HIV/AIDS monitoring and evaluation \nsystems through small-scale studies that enhance the knowledge base from which indicators \nand  assessments  are  derived.  The  Project  will  finance  equipment  and  consulting  services \nrequired for effective implementation of project activities at central and provincial levels. \n \nC.  ADF IX Grant Component  \n49.  Grant financing of $20 million is consistent with the objectives and criteria set out for \nutilization of the Asian Development Fund IX grants for HIV/AIDS and other communicable \ndiseases and is justified at both country and project levels. The Project is aligned with Viet \nNam\u2019s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy and directly supports ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to reducing poverty and assisting Viet Nam to achieve its development goals. The \nProject will contribute directly to reducing the impact of the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic in Viet \nNam, particularly among young people who will bear the greatest burden both in susceptibility to \ninfection and in the economic costs at the individual and community level.  \n \nD.  Special Features \n1.  Focus on Youth in the Context of HIV/AIDS \n50.  While a lot of lip service is given to the role young people play in the spread of HIV/AIDS \nand the impact it has on them, very few comprehensive intervention programs, in Viet Nam or \nelsewhere, have focused on this group specifically. Opportunities have been missed to bring \ninnovative public health prevention and control measures to bear on the spread of the epidemic \namong  a  group  that  can  be  targeted.  Models  for  healthy  youth  development  have  been \ndeveloped and tested over many years and for different health issues with the general goal of \nreducing risks and enhancing protective factors. The Project will target youth directly and via \nthose that influence them such as parents, teachers, and popular entertainment and sports \npersonalities. The results will be in areas such as improved family support and dialogue around \nyouth issues, including sexuality and normalizing condom use. \n \n2.  Focus on Youth in the Context of HIV/AIDS \n51.  The Project will support the development and integration of a youth focus across other \nproject and program activities under the national HIV/AIDS strategy. The Project will provide \npolicy and capacity development support to VCPFC and VAAC to ensure youth issues are \nintegrated in a consistent and effective manner across a range of activities and policy dialogue ", "    13 \nand coordination forums. The Project will also develop the capacity of all HIV/AIDS-related \nmonitoring and evaluation in Viet Nam to assess youth-specific outcomes and impacts. \n \n3.  Community and Nongovernment Organization Participation \n52.  The Project calls for engagement with a wide variety of organizations and groups, both \npublic and community\u2013based. The IPC activities will offer opportunities to build relationships \nbetween generations, and between civil society organizations (e.g., youth and women\u2019s unions), \ngovernment  agencies, and  specialist  NGOs.  These  activities  will  contribute  to  building  the \ncapacity to address youth issues and HIV/AIDS and offer new partnership models. There will be \na focus on flexible approaches appropriate to local needs. Skills development for counseling \nand youth communication will contribute to project sustainability. \n \n4.  Addressing Gender Issues in HIV/AIDS Prevention \n53.  Currently 86% of all PLWHA in Viet Nam are male, largely because most IDUs are male. \nHowever, most sex workers are young women, and there are growing infection rates among these \nwomen  through  their  clients  and  boyfriends  or  husbands.  Employment  opportunities  in  the \nentertainment industry, especially for women, are growing and they are particularly attracting \nwomen who have migrated from rural areas. Gender roles create different risks for young men \nand young women, and these roles endure across generations and socioeconomic strata. Mass \nmedia materials will aim to address the gender norms that affect HIV risk through messages and \nrole model behaviors. The gender strategy (Appendix 7) addresses these issues in more detail.  \n \n5.  Addressing the Role of Migration and Mobility in HIV/AIDS Prevention \n54.  Youth  aged  20\u201324  comprise  the  largest  group  of  a  growing  population  of  mobile \nworkers  traveling  within  Viet  Nam  and  across  borders  to  seek  work.  Large  infrastructure \nprojects, including those that ADB finances, attract large numbers of young men and women as \nworkers (construction and unskilled labor and associated service industries, including sex work). \nWhile migration offers economic opportunities for many, it increases the risk of HIV infections \nbecause of (i) improved cash resources; (ii) isolation from family and other social structures that \nexert \u201cpositive\u201d peer pressures; and (iii) access to alcohol, drugs, and commercial sex. In \nprovinces, where there are large migrant or mobile youth populations, project activities will \ntarget this group through worksites, vocational training, or job recruitment centers.  \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n55.  The Project is estimated to cost $26.7 million equivalent (Table 1). Of this, $3.73 million \nequivalent (14%) is foreign exchange cost and $22.97 million equivalent (86%) local currency \ncost. The cost estimates include $1.1 million in taxes and duties and 8.6% of total costs for \ncontingencies. A summary of cost estimates is in Table 1, and further details are in Appendix 8.  \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n56.  The Government has requested a grant of $20 million from ADB's Asian Development \nFund (ADF) for the control of HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases to help finance the Project. The \ngrant will finance all of the foreign exchange costs and $16.27 million of the local currency cost. \nThe Government will provide counterpart funds of $6.7 million equivalent for taxes and recurrent \ncosts.20 The indicative financing plan is in Table 2. \n                                                 \n20 ADB\u2019s appraisal mission reviewed the government\u2019s financing plan and found it to be credible and well supported \nby central agencies and provincial authorities. \n ", "14   \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounts \nA.

Financing for the local currency cost is justified under ADB\u2019s local currency financing \npolicy.  Strengthening  Viet  Nam\u2019s  capacity  and  resources  for  responding  to  HIV/AIDS  is  a \ngovernment priority given the humanitarian and economic costs of a rapidly spreading epidemic. \nWhile  the  Government  has  committed  additional  resources  for  the  implementation  of  a \ncomprehensive response, a financing gap exists even when other international aid support is \naccounted for. Effective responses must be local and engage communities, thus requiring local \nexpenditure. A higher percentage of local financing for this Project is consistent with ADB policy. \n \n58.  Although no cofinancing is envisioned at this time, cofinancing from both public and \ncommercial sources may be mobilized in future to complement ADB financing. Cofinancing \narrangements will be presented for Government and ADB consideration as necessary. The \nGovernment  has  committed  to  providing  counterpart  funds  promptly  to  ensure  early \nimplementation of the Project.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n59.  VCPFC will be the Executing Agency (EA). A PMU, located within VCPFC, will work \nunder the overall guidance of a project steering committee. The steering committee will (i) \nprovide guidance to ensure timely and effective performance of the Project, and (ii) supervise \nstrategic planning and review and propose modifications and changes to project implementation ", "    15 \nas necessary. The steering committee will be chaired by the leader of VCPFC (Minister or Vice \nMinister)  and  members  will  include  senior  officials  from  the  participating  ministries  and \norganizations, including the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Culture and \nInformation, the Ministry of Education and Training, the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of \nViet Nam, the VAAC of MOH, the Youth Union, the Women\u2019s Union, VTV, VOV and the \nFarmers\u2019 Union.  \n \n60.  The PMU will coordinate national and provincial activities, and serve as a liaison point \nbetween the provinces, VCPFC, and ADB. A project director will head the PMU, with the \nsupport of a vice director and at least six full-time staff to provide technical expertise and \nadministrative support in areas of accounting, contract administration, disbursement, planning, \nand procurement. Appendix 9 shows the project management and implementation structure. \n \n61.  A provincial project management unit (PPMU) will be established by the Provincial \nCommittee for Population Family and Children (PCPFC) for each subproject, with a director, \naccountant,  and  component  activity  coordinator(s).  Each  PPMU  will  (i)  oversee  the \nimplementation of all subproject activities by NGOs and other mass organizations, (ii) monitor \nand evaluate province-based project activities to ensure the quality of project outputs, and (iii) \nreport to the PMU. \n \n2.  Implementation Period and Schedule \n62.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from about July 2006 to July 2011. \nProvincial activities will be implemented in two phases: (i) phase 1 (2006\u20132008) will involve the \nimplementation of five provincial action plans, and (ii) phase 2 (2008\u20132011) will incorporate \nlessons learned from phase 1 into the action plans for the 10 additional provinces for a total of \n15. Workshops and cross-provincial visits will facilitate the links and sharing of lessons learned \nbetween phases and provinces. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n63.  All ADB-financed procurement will be in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines. \nLimited international bidding (LIB) or national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures will be used \nwhile shopping will be used for goods costing not more than $150,000 and works costing not \nmore  than  $100,000.  The  PMU  will  handle  all  procurement  using  LIB  or  NCB.  Shopping \nprocedures may be used by the provinces, to be supervised by the PMU. The project does not \nsupport civil works. The Government and ADB have agreed upon the methods of procurement \nand selection of consulting services as outlined in the indicative procurement plan (PP) set out \nin  Appendix  11.  As  the  project  was  processed  under  the  former  Guidelines,  there  was \ninsufficient time for the government to approve the PP as required by the new Guidelines. The \ngovernment will expedite approval of the PP and no procurement activity will commence under \nthe project until a PP acceptable to ADB, is approved. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n64.  The Project will require 54 person-months of international consulting services and 360 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  Three  international  and  34  domestic \nconsultants (including two for each province) will be contracted as individual consultants. An \ninternational media agency will be recruited as a firm to provide technical assistance inputs and \noversee production of the mass media component. The firm will be selected using ADB quality-\nbased selection methods, as the quality of the services is of overriding importance for the \ndownstream impact and outcome of the Project. There will be single source selection of the \n ", "16   \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) for the provision of youth and HIV/AIDS policy expertise \nbecause of WHO\u2019s shared objectives and experience of exceptional worth. NGOs, international \nand/or local and including mass organizations, will be contracted to provide harm reduction, \npeer education, and life skills training programs under component 3. Individual consultants, the \nconsulting firm, and the NGOs will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants.  Appendix  11  summarizes  the  consulting  services  inputs  and  methods  of \nselection, and provides details on contracting of NGOs (including mass organizations). \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n65.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand  VCPFC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of VCPFC and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n66.  The PMU will use ADB imprest account procedures for eligible project expenditures. \nAn  imprest  account  for  the  grant  will  be  established  by  the  PMU  at  a  commercial  bank, \nacceptable to ADB, within 1 month of grant effectiveness. The account will have a ceiling of $1 \nmillion; the initial deposit will be based on estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of \nproject implementation or $1 million, whichever is lower. Second generation imprest accounts \n(SGIAs) will be established by PPMUs at the Provincial Treasury.21 The initial deposit will be \nbased on estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation or $50,000, \nwhichever is lower. The imprest account and SGIAs will be established, managed, replenished, \nand liquidated in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended from \ntime to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. Statement \nof  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidate \nadvances to the imprest accounts to facilitate project implementation. The maximum payment \nfor any individual item using statement of expenditure is $100,000 per payment.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Anticorruption \n67.  VCPFC has implemented a number of similar projects financed by ADB and others \nduring  the  past  10  years  and  its  financial  management  capacity  is  considered  adequate.  \nVCPFC will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation within 30 \ndays of each calendar quarter period. Progress reports will be in English and will include \ninformation on disbursement and the status of all implementation on all aspects of the Project. \n \n68.  The Government, acting through VCPFC, will maintain accounts and records showing \na clear link between activities and expenditures related to the Project. The PMU will (i) keep \nproject accounts separate from regular accounts; (ii) ensure accounts and financial statements \n                                                 \n21 Second-generation  imprest  accounts  are  considered  appropriate  for  the  Project,  where  PPMU  financial \nmanagement capacity can be verified, given (i) the geographical disbursement of project provinces, (ii) the large \nnumber of small-scale training and outreach activities that PPMUs will manage, and (iii) the fact that such accounts \nwill be established in the Provincial Treasury ensuring efficient management. Under recent amendments to the \nGovernment of Viet Nam procedures, such accounts can be audited. ", "    17 \nare audited annually in a timely fashion, in accordance with sound accounting principles, by \nexternal auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the \nclose of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited project accounts, including all imprest \naccounts, statement of expenditure, and financial statements; and the auditor\u2019s reports, together \nwith a report of actions taken by VCPFC to improve the financial management system. The \nProject will finance the cost of independent and external auditing.22 \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n69.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  HIV/AIDS-related  programs  and  projects  are  a  key \nchallenge  for  the  Government.  There  has  been  significant  technical  expertise  directed  at \nestablishing  a  national  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  supported  by  the  World  Bank \nHIV/AIDS project. It is expected that all internationally supported projects will utilize a common \nset of monitoring indicators. While the framework for Viet Nam is still to be finalized, the \nmeasures indicated in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) are consistent with \nthe most up-to-date draft. The Project will also support some ongoing analysis of data to further \ndevelop and refine youth- and BCC-related measures, both as an input to refining the design of \nthis Project and for adoption in other activities, including the Government\u2019s national system. The \nPMU will work with the PPMUs to ensure that timely and effective data collection systems are in \nplace and that information collected is analyzed and used to refine project activities through the \ncourse of implementation. All data will be disaggregated by gender and ethnicity. \n \n9.  Reporting \n70.  Prior to grant effectiveness, VCPFC will submit monthly reports to ADB on the steps \nbeing  taken  for  achieving  effectiveness.  After  the  Project  becomes  effective,  VCPFC  will \nprepare a quarterly progress report summarizing (i) progress made against established targets; \n(ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve issues; (iii) compliance with \ngrant  covenants;  (iv)  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the  next  6  months;  (v)  expected \nprogress during the succeeding period; and (vi) status of provincial activities. Within 3 months of \nproject completion, the Government will prepare and submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n10.  Project Review \n71.  The Government and ADB will conduct periodic reviews of the Project to ensure smooth \nimplementation. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a phase 1 review after 18 \nmonths of implementation. The review will focus on the experience of implementation in the five \nphase 1 provinces in order to review and enhance phase 2 activities. The Government and ADB \nwill conduct a midterm review after 30 months of implementation. Given the coordination role \nplayed by the VAAC of MOH for Viet Nam\u2019s national HIV/AIDS strategy, all reports will be \nshared and participation in review missions will be invited. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n72.  It is estimated that the Project will result in the avoidance of more than 34,000 HIV \ninfections over a 20-year period. The savings of individuals, communities, and governments will \nbenefit, the growth in infection rates will be contained, and individuals will lead more productive \nand healthy lives. Financial, technical and social risks can be addressed. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2002.

Guidelines \nfor the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. \nManila. \n ", "18   \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n73.  The  Project  will  generate  significant  economic  benefits  by  reducing  the  losses \nassociated with HIV infection at the individual, household, community, and national levels. The \ncosts associated with HIV infection include reduced productivity for the infected person and his \nor her carer(s), health care costs (which can be significant and sustained over long periods),  \nand premature mortality. These benefits will be greater for those who are most vulnerable to \nHIV infection and its consequences, including the poor, young men, and members of ethnic \nminorities, as well as mobile youth and youth working in particular industries (e.g., tourism and  \ntransport). There will be economic benefits to communities at the local and national levels \nthrough (i) reduced public health care costs, and (ii) greater poverty improvements which are \ndirectly affected by growing HIV/AIDS epidemics.  \n \nB.  Social Benefits \n74.  The Project will result in lower HIV infection rates and benefit young people who would \nhave  been  infected  had  they  not  been  educated  about  behavioral  options  and  given  the \nresources to change their behaviors (e.g., access to HIV testing, condoms, and clean needles). \nBenefits will extend to the partners and families of people who might have been infected, as the \nsubsequent risk of infection and cost of care and lost productivity is removed. Among all young \npeople, project benefits will be greater for those practicing high-risk behaviors (unsafe sex, drug \nuse) and vulnerable youth as they will be targeted by specific project activities. An overall focus \non reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV infection should also provide \nbenefits to sex workers, IDUs, PLWHA, and their families, as they try to access services and \nretain or regain their social and economic activities.  \n \n75.  Women and girls will benefit from increased awareness about their vulnerability to \ninfection and the role of men, especially young men, in the spread of the epidemic. The male \nbehaviors and power imbalances between men and women that exacerbate women\u2019s HIV \nvulnerability will be addressed through role modeling and increased awareness. Boys and men \nshould benefit from safer sex and reductions in other risky practices. \n \n76.  There will be benefits to ethnic minority populations, as project activities, including \nmedia programs, will target language and isolation barriers that increase risk. The Project has \nan ethnic minority action framework (Appendix 15) that outlines the actions needed to address \nthe particular risks faced by youth in isolated communities, especially as they migrate. \n \nC.  Risks \n77.  The Project has some financial, technical, and social risks. Financially, the Project will \nrequire the timely provision of government counterpart funds at the central and provincial levels. \nIn the long term, the sustainability and ongoing impact of the project investments will require \ngrowing government HIV/AIDS budgets and a commitment to sustaining programs that have \nbeen proven to be effective and a youth focus to HIV prevention. This risk has been addressed \nthrough the course of project preparations, through regular consultations with the Ministry of \nFinance and through written commitments from provincial governments in all proposed project \nprovinces.  \n \n78.  Technically, the Project will need to have creative control over media materials to \nensure effective messages are sent on sensitive topics such as youth sexuality, gender norms, \nand drug use. While the national HIV/AIDS strategy identifies this need generally and stipulates \nthat there is government support for these approaches, implementation is yet to be tested on ", "    19 \nsuch a large and public scale. The mechanisms for developing and approving media materials \nhave been established and agreed to in the process of project preparation. \n \n79.  For the television drama series and associated materials to have maximum impact, \nbroadcasting will need to be at peak viewing and/or listening times. The risk of not securing \nsuch access has been addressed through specific negotiations with VTV and VOV radio. A \nProject assurance section documents the support that both agencies have guaranteed.  \n \n80.  The Project also relies on the capacity of the VCPFC and provincial committees to \ncontract and administer high-quality NGO services for the delivery of effective youth-focused \ninterventions. This risk is mitigated by the resources committed to project management and \ncapacity building for PMU and PPMU staff as well as the advance preparations for NGO \ncontracting and selection processes (Appendix 12). \n \n81.  The key social risk is that, to achieve its goals and objective, the Project needs to \nchange the attitudes and behaviors of youth as well as the knowledge and attitudes of their \ncontextual environments, including those of parents, families, and communities. To do this \neffectively, the project activities will have to appropriately and adequately address the sensitive \ncultural and intergenerational issues that affect behavior. The likelihood of success in this area \ncan  be  improved  through  careful  research,  regular  monitoring  of  the  response  to  media \nmessages,  and  appropriate  adjustments.  Training  for,  and  monitoring  of,  NGOs  and  other \nimplementing partners will also be important. \n \n82.  Sustainability is a key concern for all projects. However, the Government\u2019s budget for \nHIV/AIDS is increasing annually and it is reasonable to expect that BCC, mass media, and \nyouth  programs  will  benefit  from  this.  The  Project  will  invest  in  capacity  building  for  the \nimplementation of future mass media activities and in the provinces for the implementation of \ncommunity-based youth outreach programs (government agencies and NGOs). The planned \nmaterials should prove very popular, especially among young people, leading to demand for \nfurther production and broadcasting. \n \n83.  There should be no adverse physical impact. Land acquisition and resettlement is not \nrequired as the Project does not support civil works. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n84.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and VCPFC have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Law. The Government will ensure that the \nrelevant implementation regulations, particularly those related to harm reduction and \nVCT access, will be issued following passage of the National HIV/AIDS Law23.  \n \n(ii)  Ethnic  minorities.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  ethnic  minority  development \nframework  is  fully  considered  and  applied  to  all  project  activities  and  that  PMU \nmonitoring of provincial activities will address the implementation of specific measures. \n \n(iii)  Gender  strategy.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  Project\u2019s  gender  strategy  is \nimplemented; that targets and design features are incorporated across project activities \nincluding the provincial action plans and monitoring and evaluation indicators. Equal \n                                                 \n23 Enactment is expected during the June 2006 National Assembly.  \n ", "20   \nemployment and access to opportunities, including training, will be provided for men and \nwomen during project implementation. \n \n(iv)  Counterpart funds. The Government will ensure that all necessary counterpart funds \nare provided in a timely manner and that provincial partners make timely submissions for \nannual  budget  requests  and  take  all  other  measures  necessary  for  the  prompt \nappropriation and disbursement of funds during each year of project implementation.  \n \n(v)  Involvement of youth and PLWHA. VCPFC will ensure a process is in place so that \nyouth and PLWHA are consulted on a semi annual basis and regarding all aspects of \nproject  implementation,  including  planning,  formative  research,  implementation,  and \nevaluation, and reports are submitted to the project steering committee. \n \n(vi)  MOH  will  support  community-based  and  youth-accessible  VCT  services.  The \nGovernment will ensure that project-supported community-based counseling and testing \nare authorized and can access Department of Health testing facilities at the district and \nprovincial levels, as well as at regional confirmation facility and necessary health care \nservices that may be required following a positive test result. The Government will \nensure that health services at the provincial and district levels support this approach. \n \n(vii)  Contracting for service delivery. VCPFC will ensure that selection of NGOs and/or \nmass organizations for service delivery at the province level is weighted in favor of \nNGOs and/or mass organizations that have existing operations in the provinces and \nwhich have proven that they can deliver high-quality services at the community level for \nhigh-risk and vulnerable youth. Usual ADB recruitment procedures will apply. \n \n(viii)  Broadcasting  of  national  mass  media  programs.  VTV will ensure that free-to-air \nbroadcasting  will  be  provided  on  VTV  Channel  One  during  high-rating  television \nbroadcast times, together with at least one repeat screening per week for about 105 \ndrama shows produced under the Project over a 3-year period. VOV radio will ensure \nthat a talkback radio show, lasting a minimum of 1 hour and, based on the TV show, will \nbe aired free of charge in high-rating times, soon after the TV broadcast. \n \nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness \n85.  Prior to the effectiveness of the grant agreement, VCPFC will establish guidelines for \nimplementing the Project that specify the roles and responsibilities of the PMU and PPMUs. \n \nVI.

In December 2004, it was estimated that, globally, 39.4 million people were living with \nHIV. While 70% of current infections are found in Sub-Saharan Africa, the large populations of \nAsia may bear a heavy proportion of the global HIV burden in the next decade. The Joint United \nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that 8.2 million people in Asia, including \n2.3 million women, were living with HIV at the end of 2004. This was an increased from 7.2 \nmillion (1.9 million women) in 2002.1 UNAIDS estimates that 1.2 million people became newly \ninfected  in  the  region  in  2004,  and  540,000  people  died  because  of  AIDS.  The  growing \nepidemics  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  India  dominate  the  region\u2019s  statistics. \nCambodia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand have HIV epidemics that have already \nmoved beyond high-risk groups.    \n \nA.  Transmission \n2.  The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia, due largely to injecting drug use and sex work, is \ndistinctly different from that in Sub-Saharan Africa. The spread from injecting drug users (IDUs) \nto other population groups often starts with sex workers. As people who are marginalized\u2014often \nwith  similar  illegal  status\u2014IDU  men  often  partner  with  women  who  are  sex  workers,  or \nthemselves become sex workers to support their drug needs. Transmission from sex workers to \ntheir clients is inevitable if condoms are not used. The clients of sex workers are from all parts of \na broader community, single and married, and include mobile workers and men who have sex \nwith men who lead ostensibly heterosexual lives. Other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \nincrease susceptibility to HIV and the current high prevalence of STIs fuels the epidemic.  \n \nB.  Risk Factors for Transmission \n3.  Marginalization.  The  intolerance,  fear,  and  misunderstanding  associated  with \nmarginalized groups (most particularly IDUs, sex workers, and men who have sex with men) \ncan become a risk factor in itself. These groups are isolated from information, education, and \nhealth care services, and from the economic and social security that enables them to protect \nthemselves and their partners.  \n \n4.  Weak Health Systems. Poorly functioning health care systems are not only adversely \naffected by a growing HIV epidemic, but also become a risk factor for the further spread of HIV. \nWithout effective health care system capacity, including capacity to operate safe blood supplies, \ntreat STIs, provide counseling and testing, and prevent mother-to-child-transmission, the risk of \nHIV transmission remains high and grows as infection spreads. \n \n5.  Youth  and  Vulnerability.  Young  people  between  the  ages  of  15  and  24,  who \nconstitute  approximately  20%  of  Asia's  population,  are  already  seriously  affected  by  the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic. Of those living with HIV in Asia, 22% are between the ages of 15 and 24. \nThe cultural resistance to teaching youth about the realities of sex (and drugs) has been one of \nthe greatest obstacles to protecting the next generation from HIV and other STIs. \n \n6.  Mobility and Migration. In both Asia and Africa, people on the move have proven to \nbe a significant factor in the spread of HIV. When large numbers of men migrate for work, high-\nrisk behaviors increase and the spread of HIV is almost inevitable while women are also \nincreasingly on the move. Mobility, as distinct from migration, also increases vulnerability, and \napplies  to  occupational  groups  such  as  truckers,  sailors,  fishermen,  construction  workers, \n                                                 \n1  The UNAIDS categorization of Asia comprises ADB\u2019s South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Greater Mekong Subregion \ncountries plus the People\u2019s Republic of China.  ", "26  Appendix 2 \ntraders, and sex workers moving where opportunities arise. Mines, logging camps, construction \nsites, ports, and other economic enclaves in which large groups of men with money can be \nfound attract women who sell sex. Mobile women, including sex workers, seasonal workers, and \nfactory workers are also in situations of vulnerability. \n \nC.  Vietnamese Youth and the Risk of HIV/AIDS \n7.  Vietnamese traditions place great emphasis on the duty of children to work and study \nhard,  serve  parents,  and  the  family  unit.  Increasingly,  these  traditional  approaches  to \nresponsibility and family structure are not working as smoothly as in the past, especially where \nthere are strains due to unemployment, substance abuse, and changing expectations and \naspirations.2  \n \n8.  There  has  been  much  public  discussion  in  Viet  Nam  about  the  roles,  rights,  and \nresponsibilities of youth. Some of the focus on youth arises because overall social change (both \npositive and negative) is most evident in the behaviors and lifestyles of young people who adapt \nreadily to new technologies, and seek out new experiences with enthusiasm. Youth are highly \nvisible in some of Viet Nam\u2019s fastest-growing sectors, such as tourism and industrial zones, and \nmake up much of the country\u2019s increasing pool of migrant workers. The high proportion of youth \namong  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS  undoubtedly  adds  to  generalized  concerns  about  this \npopulation. \n \n1.  Knowledge and Risk Behaviors \n9.  While youth make up the greatest number of people living with HIV/AIDS, most do not \nengage in risky practices, despite public perceptions. A 1999 survey in six provinces among \n1,500 youth aged 15\u201322 found that just 10% of males and 5% of females reported having \npremarital sex. The rate among those aged 15\u201319 was 6% in males and 2% in females (versus \n27% in boys and 3% in girls of this age in Thailand).3 Similar findings were released recently \nfrom the 2004 baseline survey of the reproductive health initiative for youth in Asia (RHIYA) Viet \nNam program, which assessed awareness, attitudes, practices, and behaviors among 1,390 \nrural  and  urban  respondents  aged  15\u201324  from  11  provinces.  The survey  found  just  7.6% \nreported having sexual intercourse and that 45% reported not knowing how to use condoms. \n \n10.  A survey assessment of Vietnamese youth (SAVY)4 conducted by the Ministry of Health \n(MOH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2004 surveyed 7,584 individuals aged 14\u2013\n25 and found just 16 boys and 4 girls aged 14\u201317 years of age that reported ever having had \nsex. Among those aged 18\u201325, 15.4% of males and 2.3% of females reported having had sex, \nwith rates somewhat higher for urban males (19.8%) than for rural males (13.6%). Female rates \nwere nearly identical for urban (2.6%) and rural (2.2%) residents. The survey found that just \n0.5% of respondents reported ever having used any illicit drug. However, 42.4% of urban youth \nand 20.8% of rural youth said they knew someone who had used drugs, suggesting some \nunderreporting of drug use and experimentation. Among urban males, 16.3% aged 22\u201325 said it \nwas easy to access heroin.  \n \n                                                 \n2  It should also be noted that there is a growing interest in a concept called \u201cfamily development\u201d in Viet Nam, \nincluding through the Viet Nam Commission for Population, Family and Children.  \u201cFamily development\u201d overlaps \nto some extent with WHO\u2019s \u201chealthy youth development\u201d in that it recognizes the needs and potential of the family \nunit in the well-being of the individual and the community.  \n3  Mensch, B. et al. 2004.

The  SAVY  explored  factors  linked  to  potential  HIV  risk,  including  knowledge  and \nattitudes. Results showed knowledge of STIs was incomplete, with about two-thirds of the \nsample able to identify only three: hepatitis B, syphilis, and gonorrhea. Nationally, 97% had \nheard of HIV/AIDS, and about half had heard about the disease from multiple sources, with \nmass media named most frequently, followed by family and professionals (schools and civil \nsociety organizations).  \n \n12.  Just over half the sample (52%) were assessed as having a high knowledge level about \nHIV, 39% had a medium level, and 9% a low level. SAVY found 85% knew than an HIV positive \nperson could look healthy. About two thirds knew where they could access HIV testing. Nearly \n98% recognized that condoms could prevent transmission, and 96% knew that sharing needles \nshould be avoided.  About 70% thought condoms reduce pleasure and half felt those who carry \nthem might have \u201cimproper relations\u201d.  \n \n13.  Far fewer young men (48%) had spoken to their family about reproductive health than \nhad  young  women  (78%),  though  similar  numbers  reported  talking  about  HIV.  The  SAVY \nresearchers attributed this to the fact that HIV is \u201ca predominantly male issue\u201d linked to drugs \nand sex workers. Overall, 40% claimed they had never heard of homosexuality, and of the 60% \nwho had, 80% said they would not accept a homosexual man as a friend. \n \n2.  Education and Jobs: Addressing Vulnerability  \n14.  While literacy rates are very high in Viet Nam (95% for males, 91% for females in 2000) \nand about 95% of youth have attended school, high dropout rates remain a problem, particularly \nin rural areas. Approximately 54% of youth aged 14\u201325 years in rural areas drop out of school \nat the lower secondary level. The figure for urban youth is 39%. When the figures for primary \nand secondary school dropouts are combined, less than 30% of rural youth complete upper \nsecondary school. In urban areas, just over 50% complete upper secondary. The main reason \ncited for leaving school was the cost of fees.  \n \n15.  Youth job creation is a major priority for Viet Nam, where around 1.4 million young \npeople enter the labor market annually. The UN Country Assessment of 2004 highlights the \ninadequacy  of  opportunities  for  vocational  training  and  tertiary  education,  calling  youth \nunemployment a \u201cmissed opportunity for growth and a root cause of social problems such as \ndepression, crime, and alcohol and drug abuse\u201d.5 \n \n16.  Youth unemployment is estimated at 4\u20138%, but up to 16% in cities. Young women have \nslightly higher unemployment rates, but overall, around 26% of youth are underemployed.  \nYoung  people  in  Viet  Nam  are  anxious  about  jobs  and  security.  The  SAVY  found  that \napproximately 12% of young people (15\u201324 years) were neither in work nor school, and this \nrose to 28% among married youth. About 64% report that it is difficult to find a job. When asked \nto name their two highest aspirations, employment was named first by the greatest proportion of \nrespondents (49.6%), with 23.3% naming economic security. Less than 10% named overall \nhappiness, a clear indication that economic vulnerability remains a paramount concern. \n \n17.  Job creation and skills development for youth are important elements of an effective HIV \nprevention program in Viet Nam. It is estimated that thousands of young Vietnamese women \nare trafficked outside the country each year, particularly into the Cambodia; People\u2019s Republic \nof China; Republic of Korea; Singapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand. This exploitation is linked \nto poverty, family difficulties, low education, and unemployment, and ultimately to high-risk \nbehaviors such as drug use and sex work.  \n                                                 \n5  United Nations Country Team. 2004.

The  aim  of  youth  HIV  prevention  programs  is  to  reduce  high-risk  behaviors, \nspecifically, sex without condoms and the sharing of needles and syringes. Changing youth \nbehavior and reducing the chance that youth will undertake risky behaviors in the first place \nrequire information and services to be delivered, with an accurate understanding of the social \ncontext in which young people make decisions.1 Lessons learned over the past decade \nindicate that many approaches are needed for youth HIV prevention, including (i) building \nprotection (through skills, knowledge, and safer environments); (ii) targeted communication to \nrisk groups; (iii) providing harm reduction services and hardware (to enable healthy choices); \nand (iv) involving youth as decision makers and partners in implementation.  \n \nA.  Approaches to Youth HIV Prevention \n2.  The concept of \u201chealthy youth development\u201d is based on the pillars of building \nprotective factors and removing risks. Protective factors include \u201cadults of influence\u201d (parents, \nteachers, and leaders) that (i) express empathy, (ii) are encouraging and affirming, and (iii) \nare not overly critical. Programs that have effectively enhanced protective factors include (i) \nparenting skills training, (ii) participatory teaching methods, and (iii) school\u2013based programs.  \n \n3.  \u201cLife skills\u201d for healthy youth development and HIV prevention are specific and \ninclude:  negotiation,  conflict  resolution,  empathy,  critical  thinking,  decision-making,  and \ncommunication. These skills help youth to build supportive respectful relationships among \nthemselves and with parents and adults. They contribute to self-esteem and facilitate dispute-\nresolution and the ability to resist both peer and adult pressure to take unnecessary risks.  \n \n4.  In addition to the \u201chealthy youth development\u201d and \u201clife skills\u201d concepts, successful \nstrategies  for  youth  HIV  prevention  have  incorporated  a  number  of  common  features \nincluding: \n \n(i)  providing a policy context that ensures youth can access HIV and reproductive \nhealth education and services (including voluntary counseling and testing), \nand are not discriminated against;  \n(ii)  reaching people who influence young people (parents, teachers, and leaders), \nsince youth act more responsibly when these adults offer good role models, \naffirming relationships, and safe environments;  \n(iii)  segmenting  programs  by  age  to  meet  the  needs  of  youth  at  different \ndevelopmental stages and in different environments; \n(iv)  mobilizing the educational system to become a vehicle for a comprehensive \nprevention and care program for school-age youth; \n(v)  addressing gender factors such as girls\u2019 opportunities for education and jobs \nand concepts of masculinity that lead young men to risky behavior; and   \n(vi)  opening the dialogue between adults and young people on sensitive issues, \nincluding adolescent sexuality, sexual health education, sexual violence and \nabuse, gender roles, and traditional practices in culturally acceptable ways. \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2003. HIV/AIDS and Youth \u201cAt a Glance\u201d. \n  Available: http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DISABILITY/Resources/Health-and-Wellness/HIV_CYfactsheet.txt ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nB.  Behavior Change Communication: Theory and Evidence \n5.  Analysis of historical trends and prevention strategies has shown that the provision \nof information alone is not effective for reducing risk behavior.2 It was long assumed that \npeople would alter their practices if they were made aware of the risks, an assumption that \nled many information, education, and communication (IEC) campaigns. However, evaluations \nincreasingly showed that individuals cannot always make changes, despite their willingness, \ndue  to  the  influence  of  wider  socio-cultural,  economic,  and  environmental  forces.  For \ninstance, knowing about condoms is not enough if access, skills, and partners willing to use \nthem  are  lacking.  Obstacles  to  behavior  change  must  also  be  addressed  through \ncommunications and through actions that change social norms and situations that make risk-\ntaking behaviors more likely.  \n \n6.  Behavior  change  communication  (BCC)  programs  must  be  grounded  in \nassessments  of  the  social  and cultural  context  where  behaviors  occur.3  Communication \nmaterials are often developed according to the assumptions of health programmers or based \non  knowledge  from  unrepresentative  samples.  If  messages  do  not  resonate  with  target \ngroups,  they  are  a  waste  of  time  and  money.  Careful,  formative  research,  using  both \nqualitative and quantitative methods, is essential to provide understanding of target needs \nand opportunities.  \n \n7.  Population-Based  Change  Depends  on  Individual  Change.  Most  health \ncampaigns aim for lasting behavior change in order to see a population-level impact, but \nbehaviors are practiced on an individual level. Campaigns must persuade specific target \ngroups about the actual benefits of behavior change, expressed in terms they understand, \nrather than appealing to notions of community benefits (though these may also strengthen \nthe argument). This means messages must be \u201ccustomized\u201d to appeal to and captivate the \ntarget group, rather than vague generic messages for everyone; and they also must be easy \nto act upon.4 \n \n8.  Entertainment\u2013Education. A key approach directed at changing social norms over \ntime  is  the  \u201center-educate\u201d  model  that  inserts  health  or  social  messages  into  popular \nentertainment. This can be achieved by working messages into television dramas, as well as \ncomic books. Magazines and newspapers can also be used for high visibility and to reach \nmass audiences. Internet\u2013based activities offer further scope to reach target groups. The \nmodel has been used for HIV prevention in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, and South Africa \n(where it used by the local NGO \u201cSoul City\u201d). Evaluation results have shown that the model \nhad an impact in changing behavior. In India, calls to a helpline increased 250% during a \nspecific campaign period and the percentage of individuals reporting having used a condom \nin their most recent visit to a sex worker rose from 87% to 92%. As a proxy indicator, retail \nsales of condoms in the \u201cred light\u201d district tripled after the launch of the campaign. Evaluation \nresults  from  South  Africa  showed  significantly  improved  awareness  of  HIV  risks  and \nimproved dialogue in families, especially from parents, on related issues.  \n \n                                                 \n2  Family Health International. 2004.

For countries with low overall prevalence and concentrated epidemics, such as Viet \nNam,  the  Joint  United  Nations  Programme  on  AIDS  (UNAIDS)  Best  Practice  series \nconcludes that BCC is the \u201ccornerstone\u201d, but should be targeted at \u201cvulnerable and high-risk \ngroups\u201d for the most effective impact (footnote 3). After successful targeting of high-risk \ngroups,  BCC  should  be  extended  to  the  less  vulnerable,  starting  with  people  who  are \nconnected to high-risk populations. Mass population approaches are also needed to enable a \nsupportive environment for prevention activities\u2014especially harm reduction\u2014to reach those \nindividuals  who  were  not  reached  by  the  earlier  approaches.  Figure  A3.1  shows  the \nmechanism by which a BCC campaign for HIV/AIDS prevention can target a number of \ngroups for a comprehensive prevention effort.  \n \nFigure A3.1: A Comprehensive BCC Model for Youth HIV/AIDS Prevention. \n \nVulnerable Youth Youth with High-Risk \n  Behaviors \nIncluding school  Including IDU, sex \nYouth  HIV Infection \ndropouts, migrants,  workers, and clients of \nand unemployed   sex workers \nProtective Factors  Behavior Change \nIncluding social  Including harm-reduction behaviors \nconnectedness, peer  such as condom use, clean needles, \nand family support, and  abstinence, and fewer sexual partners \naccurate knowledge \nTo Enhance  To Encourage \nBehavior Change Communication Mass Media Campaign  \nIntegrated with linked interpersonal communication materials and programs \n \nHIV = human immunodeficiency virus, IDU = injecting drug user. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  An Expanded and Integrated Approach to BCC \n10.  The best BCC results are produced by a \u201csystems approach\u201d, which combines \nmultiple mass media activities with community collaborations, and training that has credibility \nwith target groups. Interpersonal communication (IPC) between peers or between youth and \nthose who influence them enhance and reinforce learning that aims to persuade individuals \nto try new services or behaviors. Using several approaches simultaneously conveys a sense \nof vigor and enables the use of different approaches, which become mutually reinforcing.. \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND COORDINATION IN THE HIV/AIDS SECTOR \n \n1.  Significant international assistance has been provided to Viet Nam for the fight against \nHIV/AIDS in recent years but funding gaps remain. The national HIV/AIDS strategy estimates \nthat a comprehensive response, including a full range of activities from prevention to care and \ntreatment,  would  cost  $300  million  per  year.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  budget  for \nHIV/AIDS activities in 2006 will be approximately $6 million. This has increased steadily in \nrecent years from $4.4 million in 2003 to $5.6 million 2005. Combined with annual donor \nresources it is estimated that resources will soon meet up to 50% of the financing needs. \n \n2.  The Government of the United States program is the largest international aid program \nfor HIV/AIDS and incorporates the President\u2019s Emergency Fund for AIDS Reduction and other \nfunding sources. It is mainly implemented through US Government agencies (including the US \nCenters for Disease Control [CDC]) and nongovernment organizations (including Family Health \nInternational [FHI]). Viet Nam is the only country in Asia to receive funding from the Emergency \nFund. Expenditure in 2005 was approximately $25 million and it is expected to be up to $34 \nmillion  in  2006.  Activities  supported  include  (i)  care,  treatment,  and  support  for  PLWHA, \nincluding antiretroviral drugs; (ii) voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services, such as the \nCDC Global Aids Program (GAP), which is supporting services in up to 40 provinces; and (iii) \ntreatments for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. US Government funding has \nsome  conditions  that  limit  the  scope  of  some  programs,  including  (i)  constraints  on  the \ndistribution of needles and syringes, and (ii) the requirement to implement policies explicitly \nopposing prostitution and sex trafficking.  \n \n3.  The World Bank project, with grant financing of $35 million over 5 years, was approved \nin  2005.  The  project  is  aimed  at  helping  reduce  the  transmission  of  the  disease  within \nvulnerable groups, as well as to the general population. More than 60% of the grant will be used \nto support the design and implementation of provincial specific action plans with block grants \nprovided to 18 provinces and 2 cities. Special emphasis will be placed on (i) strengthening \ncapacity at national and provincial levels; and (ii) promoting the development of innovative, \neffective prevention and treatment approaches and models among vulnerable groups. \n \n4.  The Preventing HIV/AIDS Project has been funded by the Department for International \nDevelopment  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development \nCooperation (NORAD) since 2003 and has a total budget of approximately $25 million. The \nproject  is  managed  and  implemented  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  the  World  Health \nOrganization  (WHO)  in  21  provinces.  The  NGO  DKT  International;  the  Ministry  of  Labor, \nIndustry and Social Affairs; and the Ministry of Public Security also support the project. It \nprovides support for (i) national and provincial policy and strategy development; (ii) condom \nprovisions, especially in nontraditional or high-risk venues along with social marketing; (iii) \nsexually transmitted infection management support for MOH; and (iv) harm reduction services \nfor drug users. The project had a midterm review in 2005 and is currently undergoing some \nrestructuring  in  its  management  and  administration  with  the  goal  of  improving  operational \nefficiency.  \n \n5.  The Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has made one grant to Viet Nam \nexplicitly  for  HIV/AIDS  of  $7.5  million  for  strengthening  care,  counseling,  and  support  for \nPLWHA in three pilot provinces (Ho Chi Minh City, An Giang, and Khanh Hoa).  \n \n6.

Other  bilateral  donors  active  in  HIV/AIDS  include  the  governments  of  Sweden  and \nAustralia. Sweden\u2019s International Development Agency and the United Nations Development \nProgram are providing support for implementation of the national strategy, especially in the area \nof  leadership  and  advocacy.  From  2006  to  2010,  the  project  will  support  training  and \nawareness-raising with the Communist Party of Viet Nam and the integration of HIV/AIDS into \nViet  Nam\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  plan.  Australia,  through  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development, is supporting a regional HIV/AIDS project that includes Viet Nam \nefforts to strengthen the capacity of the health and public security sectors, including links \nbetween them for promotion of harm reduction as well as to address stigma and discrimination. \n \n8.  In addition to FHI (para. 2), a number of other NGOs have important HIV/AIDS activities \nunderway. CARE International has been active in HIV prevention in Viet Nam since 1991. It has \nimplemented behavior change communication activities focused on vulnerable groups, including \ntruck drivers and mobile workers, provided care and support for PLWHA and some micro-credit \nand vocational training schemes. Marie Stopes International focuses on reproductive health, \nespecially for youth, and provides information, education, and clinical services. Since 2003, \nsome services have also included VCT, especially targeting high-risk and vulnerable youth.  \n \n9.  Most UN agencies are also involved in HIV/AIDS programs in Viet Nam, largely within \nthe domain of their focus. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund has focused on prevention of \nmother-to-child  transmission  and  life  skills  for  young  people;  WHO  on  providing  technical \nsupport, especially in the area of treatment and care; and the United Nations Office on Drugs \nand Crime on rehabilitation and harm reduction for drug users.  \n \n10.  UNAIDS  plays  an  overall  advocacy  and  technical  support  role  focused  on  the \ndevelopment and implementation of the national strategy, technical support for monitoring and \nevaluation,  youth  issues,  and  strategy  implementation.  UNAIDS  also  plays  a  key  role  in \nfacilitating  donor  coordination.  There  is  a  dynamic  international  agency  working  group  for \npurposes of coordination with subgroups focused on areas such as media, treatment, and harm \nreduction. There is also a donor coordination group on reproductive health.  ", "    Appendix 5  33\n   \nPROVINCE SELECTION \n \n1.  Province selection was undertaken during the project preparatory phase. Criteria for \nselection were broad, incorporating the HIV/AIDS situation of a province, the risk factors within \nthe province for young people, and the project implementation capacity. The specific questions \nasked were as follows.  \n \n(i)  Is the province ranked in the top 40 by the Ministry of Health for the number of \nHIV positive cases? \n(ii)  Is the prevalence rate for HIV above 50 per 100,000 people? \n(iii)  Are the following risk factors present? \n(a)  Are there a large number of injecting drug users (IDUs) registered (i.e., \n>1,000)? \n(b)  Are there a large number of unemployed youth? \n(c)  Is there a high rate of migration of young people from rural areas to urban \nareas? \n(d)  Are there large industrial zones developed in the past 5 years? \n(iv)  Are there plans to develop any large industrial zones in the next 3\u20135 years? \n(v)  Are there major tourist locations that provide employment for young people? \n(vi)  Is  the  provincial  capital  a  major  education  center  (i.e.,  with  university  or \nvocational training colleges)? \n(vii)  Does the province have a national highway going through it? \n(viii)  Has the provincial committee for population family and children experience in \nmanaging a large donor funded project successfully? \n(ix)  Does  the  provincial  committee  for  population  family  and  children  have  the \nrequired leadership and capacity to manage the Project? \n(x)  Is there any other major HIV/AIDS project underway in this province? \n \n2.  Key information on population, poverty, HIV/AIDS, youth, and factors that contribute to \nyouth vulnerability for the selected 15 provinces is in Table A5.1. \n \n3.  Five  provinces  were  nominated  for  inclusion  in  the  first  phase  of  subproject \nimplementation. These provinces were selected from the northern region only to facilitate a \ncluster effect in programming and enable the project management unit to closely manage and \nmonitor the provincial level activities in the first 2 years with a view to improving program \nmanagement processes and effectiveness for the following years and provinces. \n \n4.  Phase 2 will see the commencement of project activities in 10 new provinces\u2014two \nadditional northern provinces, three central, and five southern (Table A5). \n ", " \nTable A5: Selected Characteristics for Project Provinces \n \n3\n4\nTotal  %  HIV/AIDS Data  Young People in School  Net   \nMigration \nRegion and  Pop  Poverty  Pop  Industrial  Tourism \nProvince  (\u2018000)  Rateb  % EM  aged  HIV/AIDS  HIV/AIDS  HIV/AIDS  University,  Rate  Zone  A\nPrevalence  Ranking  Upper  colleges,  (per 1,000  p\n15\u201324  Registered  p\nper 100,000  by  Secondary  technical  people)  e\nIDU  n\nPeople  Province  schools  d\nix\nNorthern Region                           5\nHa Noia  2,931.4  5.2  0.1  21.3  238.81  3  13,813  100,084  481,555  56.3  X  X   \nHa Tay a  2,452.5  26.0  1.2  19.4  30.89  26  3,847  107,170  11,891       \nBac Ninh a  971.3  12.1  0.1  19.3  63.83  32  1,182  45,200  8,898  (19.6)  X   \nPhu Thoa  1,301.4  6.4  14.6  18.7  36.67  36  1,535  52,350  6,878  (11.1)  X  X \nQuang Ninha  1,039.8  6.4  11.1  19.9  641.41  2  1,931  37,170  8,124  9.4  X  X \nHai Duong  1,684.2  23.1  0.3  18.2  96.3  11  1,504  61,670  6,170  0  X   \nDien Bienc  431.9  -  -  20.5  53.98  44  4,951  13,140  3,094  5.3    X \nCentral Region  0                       \nQuang Tri   596.8  41.8  9.1  17.2  7.99  61  10  24,160  2,229  (13.0)    X \nThua Thien Hue  1,091.6  29.7  3.7  18.7  20.48  51  137  36,740  3,8072  (13.8)    X \nDa Nang  724.0  4.3  0.6  20.7  59.7  39  665  26,710  61,051  16.7  X  X \nSouthern Region  0                       \nBinh Duong  787.5  8.6  2.9  22.2  125.76  24  1,108  24,120  4,720  58.9  X   \nLong An  1,377.5  16.2  3.0  20.8  76.99  22  1,233  34,010  1,631  (10.6)  X   \nDong Thap  1,660.5  31.4  0.2  21.3  109.82  10  401  36,380  3,144  (7.4)    X \nCan Tho  1,121.1  21.9  3.3  22.3  122.4  8  1,941  40,350  43,231  (1.5)  X   \nBa Ria- Vung Tau  856.1  7.6  3.0  19.0  283.55  7  823  30,400  3,830  34.0  X  X \nTotal  19,027.6                       \nEM = ethnic minority, HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, IDU = injecting drug user, Pop = population. \na  Province to be included in phase 1 of project implementation, - = not available \nb  As determined by the Government Statistical Office from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey 2002. \nc  Poverty rate and percentage ethnic minority figures are not available for Dien Bien as it is a newly formed province.

Introduction \n \n1.  Phu Tho is a northern province comprising 10 districts and two urban centers. The \npopulation is approximately 1.3 million, with almost 20% being young people aged 15\u201324. Most \nof the population (85%) lives in rural areas. More than 45,000 students attend 52 education \nfacilities, including a university, 2 colleges and 7 vocational training centers, 13 centers for \nhigher education, and 29 training centers. Phu Tho is bordered by six provinces and is traversed \nby major transportation routes that connect it to Hanoi and Hai Phong and border crossings with \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. The Ha Noi\u2013Lao \nCao rail and the Ho Chi Minh highway will be built through this province. The expansion of \ntransportation networks will increase Phu Tho\u2019s potential for tourism, trade, and economic \nexchanges and also the risk of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n2.  Phu  Tho\u2019s  economy  has  been  shifting  rapidly  from  agriculture  to  manufacturing, \nconstruction, and service sectors. In 2005, revenue from these sectors accounted for 74% of \ngross domestic product (GDP). The average GDP has risen 9.7% since 2000 and the overall \nrate of poverty has been halved to 5% since 2000. Approximately 6.8% of households have a \ntelephone and 90% have access to television. However, Phu Tho is still a poor province given \nits low economic starting point for development.  \n \nB.  Current HIV/AIDS Situation \n \n3.  At the end of August 2005, the Provincial Administration of HIV/AIDS Prevention and \nControl had recorded 975 HIV positive people in the province. Of these, 190 had progressed to \nfull blown AIDS and 147 had died. The actual prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Phu Tho in 2005 is \nestimated  to  be  approximately  3,150  people,  representing  0.23%  of  the  total  population. \nApproximately 90% of those infected are young males.  \n \nC.  The Risks for HIV Transmission among the Youth of Phu Tho \n \n4.  Unemployment. The unemployment rate for the province is 7.6%, from an available \nworkforce of 670,000 people of which 190,000 are aged 18\u201324. \n \n5.  Mobility. Although 85% of Phu Tho residents live in rural or mountainous areas, many \nleave for other cities and/or provinces to look for work. In one of the poorest mountainous \ndistricts of Cam Khe, more than 30 people who had been, or had relations with, migrant \nworkers, were found to be HIV positive.  \n \n6.  Industrialization. There are five main industrial zones that include a fertilizer plant and \na paper mill. Industrial enterprises employ nearly 70,000 workers or 11% of the workforce. Most \nof these are young people living away from home for extended periods. \n \n7.  Tourism. Sites such as the Hung Temple, and the annual Hung festival attract millions \nof tourists. There are 70 restaurants and hotels employing thousands of workers, most of them \nare young women.  \n \n8.  Drugs. Phu Tho is recognized as a hot spot for illicit drug use and sex work. There are \nover 1,300 residents in rehabilitation centers, of which 73% are aged 15\u201335 years, and most of \nthem are male.  \n \nD.  Provincial Strategy on HIV/AIDS and Action Plan to 2010 \n \n9.  To implement the national HIV/AIDS strategy, Phu Tho has developed an action plan. \nThe goal is to keep prevalence of HIV/AIDS under 0.3% prevalence by 2010 with no further \nincrease after 2010, and to reduce the harm caused by HIV/AIDS infection. ", "36  Appendix 6 \n10.  The main agencies involved in HIV/AIDS prevention for young people in Phu Tho are the \nDepartment  of  Health,  the  provincial  committee  for  population  family  and  children,  the \nDepartment  of  Culture  and  Information,  the  Department  of  Education  and  Training,  the \nprovincial police, the Department of Labor Invalids and Social Affairs, mass media agencies \n(particularly  provincial  TV  and  radio  stations)  and  mass  organizations  (e.g.,  the  Provincial \nFather Land Front, Women\u2019s Union, Farmers\u2019 Union, and Youth Union). \n \n11.  Support of Government and Donors on HIV/AIDS. Phu Tho\u2018s budget is able to meet \nonly one third of its estimated HIV/AIDS program needs and it looks for the financial support \nfrom the central Government. To date, three international agencies have implemented projects \nin Phu Tho, but these projects are all now finished (Table A6).  \n \nTable A6: Previous HIV/AIDS Projects in Phu Tho Province \n \nOrganization  Implementing Site  Target Groups  Period \n       \nGlobal Fund to Fight   Phu Ninh, Cam Khe, Viet  Health care for  2004\u20132005 \nAIDS, Tuberculosis  Tri, Phu Tho, and Doan  villages and PLWHA \nand Malaria  Hung \nICCO (Dutch NGO)  Viet Tri (3 wards)  PLWHA  2004\u20132005 \nPlan International  Cam Khe (1 village)  Health care for  2005 \nvillages and PLWHA \nAIDS = acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome, ICCO = Interchurch Organisation for Development Cooperation, PLWHA = \npeople living with HIV/AIDS, TB = tuberculosis. \nSource: Provincial officials. \n \nD.  The Project Proposal \n \n12.  Goal  and  Objectives.  To  achieve  the  goal  of  the  Phu  Tho  provincial  strategy  on \nHIV/AIDS prevention 2010\u20132020\u2014to keep prevalence below 0.3% with no further increase after \n2010. The specific objective is to reduce the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission in young people \naged 14\u201325 through behavior change communication programs. \n \n13.  Project  Sites.  Viet  Tri  city  and  Cam  Khe  district  have  been  nominated  based  on \nassessment  criteria  that  included  the  population  of  young  people,  presence  of  education \ncenters,  developing  industrial  zones,  tourism,  HIV  prevalence,  and  the  capacity  of  local \ninstitutions. Viet Tri is the capital of the province and has the highest number of HIV-infected \npeople. Cam Khe is a poor mountainous district, with 200 households and 1,000 ethnic minority \nresidents, a high rate of migration, and a large number of HIV infections. \n \n14.  Target Groups. The target group is young people 15\u201324. Specific interventions will \nfocus on subgroups, including street youth, workers in industrial zones, and youth in vocational \ntraining centers and service industries, sex workers, and injecting drug users. Indirect targets \nare people who have influence on youth such as parents and teachers. \n \nE.  Outputs from Proposed Project Activities \n \n15.  Component 1: Leadership Advocacy and Strategy Development.  \n \n(i)  Advocacy  materials  produced  by  the  project  management  unit  distributed  to \nprovincial party, state, and people\u2019s council leaders at different levels. \n(ii)  Party and state leaders at different levels support the project components by \nmaking decisions and decrees. \n(iii)  A mechanism for the involvement of youth established and implemented. \n(iv)  Youth-related  issues  and  HIV/AIDS  brought  into  the  development  phase  of \nprograms, policy, project components, and annual plan of the province.

", "38  Appendix 7 \nGENDER STRATEGY \n \n1.  The HIV/AIDS Prevention among Youth Project will have a specific focus on gender \nissues which are inherent to HIV/AIDS risk and prevention in Viet Nam. All project activities, \nparticularly the mass media campaign, will specifically address the gender norms, including \nthose related to interpersonal relationships, empowerment, and social expectations that affect \nan individual's risk of HIV/AIDS infection. Both men and women will be covered, as there are \nspecific features of HIV/AIDS risk that are associated with each sex. A gender strategy has \nbeen prepared to highlight and enunciate this focus, and to ensure sustainable targets and \nindicators for project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation are adhered to. \n \nA.  Gender and HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam \n \n2.  As in most countries, gender plays an important role in HIV risk in Viet Nam. Girls and \nwomen have greater vulnerability to infection because of biological factors which include easier \nmale\u2013female transmission, especially in younger women, and the fact that sexually transmitted \ninfections (STI) which increase the risk of HIV infection tend to be less symptomatic (and less \nlikely to be treated) in women. Girls and women are more likely to be trafficked and become sex \nworkers. The illegality of sex work in Viet Nam means sex workers cannot easily insist clients \nuse condoms, despite the target of 100% condom use in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. \nMoreover, condoms are unpopular in Viet Nam, even among youth. They are perceived as \nreducing sensation, but are also considered symbols of immorality for anyone who carries \nthem.1  \n \n3.  Gender roles are quite sharply delineated in Viet Nam. Traditional Confucian values for \nwomen and girls are refinement, self-sacrifice, and obedience, and a focus on home and family. \nMen should be active outside, make key decisions, and engage socially with other men.2 \nWomen\u2019s home-based role means they are considered responsible for the family\u2019s social and \nmoral conduct.  \n \n4.  It is estimated that women and girls bear about 75% of the burden of caring for those \nsick with AIDS.3 Household income spent on health care means less available for nutrition and \neducation, where women and girls already lack access compared with men. At this stage, most \npeople dying from AIDS in Viet Nam are male; their deaths often leave households headed by \nwomen. \n \n5.  While  girls  and  women  do  face  specific  and  increasing  risks  related  to  HIV,  the \noverwhelming majority of infections in Viet Nam have occurred among boys and men. Concepts \nof masculinity promote risk-taking and discourage self-care. Vietnamese males are more likely \nto use drugs. This largely explains the disparity between the sexes in infection rates. Moreover, \nmales use sex workers and often do not use condoms with casual partners or with wives. \nUnemployed young men spend more time outside the home with friends, and thus more readily \nbecome involved in drug use. Unemployed young women spend most of their time at home, \nlargely to do housework, but also because parents give them less freedom; therefore, they are \nless likely to engage in risky behavior. \n \n6.  Despite its obvious role in defining the risk of HIV infection, a consideration of, and \nspecific features that address, gender have been almost completely absent from prevention \n                                                 \n1\n Ministry of Health. 2005.

While awareness of gender equity is high, there is little awareness of the risks for \nboth sexes from normative gender roles. There is a widely identified need for more public \ndiscussion of these norms and for programs for youth that address gender-related risks. \n \nB.  Project Scope  \n \n7.  The Project will aim to expand the life skills of young women, especially when they have \na lower level of education, or are from disadvantaged or ethnic minority groups. Young men and \nwomen will be included in all stages of the formative research and special attention will be paid \nto eliciting the views of young girls and women separately and in confidence given the sensitivity \nof issues surrounding reproductive health and sexuality. Issues specific to young men, their \nvulnerability and risk behaviors, will also be included in the project design, both to help identify \nand challenge gender norms and to use their expertise to engage effectively with target groups \nof marginalized young men. The Project calls for equal representation of male and female \nyoung people in all phases, beginning with the formative research that will underpin the mass \nmedia components that are central to the Project. This initial work will identify the different \ncircumstances and opportunities for young men and women and how they can be influenced to \nmodify their knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors in relation to HIV/AIDS.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  Implementation arrangements and estimated costs of the gender strategy are part of \nthe overall project arrangements and total budget, as women are among the Project\u2019s primary \nbeneficiaries. Each provincial action plan shall include a gender analysis and a gender action \nplan (GAP) based on the gender strategy. The vice director of the PMU will be designated as \nthe gender focal point, responsible for ensuring all aspects of the GAP are accounted for \nthroughout the Project\u2019s implementation.4 Each provincial project management unit will have a \ngender  focal  person  who  will  receive  training  in  gender-related  issues.  NGOs  will  have \nexperience and expertise in working with a gender focus. \n \n9.  Monitoring of the gender strategy is incorporated in the overall system for the Project \nand will include gender-disaggregated data in all instances of data gathering and research. \nQuarterly and annual reports shall include a specific summary of progress toward implementing \neach GAP, which shall be examined during midterm review. Adjustments, if necessary, will be \nmade to the gender strategy during implementation. \n \nD.  Project Benefits and Implementation Impact \n \n10.  Achievement of project goal and purpose (reducing transmission and transmission risk) \nwill confer direct and indirect benefits on both sexes and release girls and women from the costs \nof caring, and losing, family members, and from the financial, emotional, and psychological \nharm  of  stigma.  It  will  further  prevent  male\u2013female  and  mother-to-child  transmission,  with \nprofound implications for productivity and earning capacity, as well as emotional health. \n \n11.  Young  men  and  women  (including  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS)  involved  in \nimplementing the Project will benefit from the acquisition of skills for future employment, and, for \nsome, paid work during the Project\u2019s lifetime. Through involvement in monitoring and evaluation, \nthey  will  learn  new  skills,  and,  through  data  gathering  and  analysis,  achieve  a  deeper \nunderstanding of the role and influence of gender norms. \n                                                 \n4\n An alternate shall be nominated to ADB in case of any change in the person in this position during implementation.

NGOs and/or mass organizations should have specific experience and skills in \ntargeting and reaching young people, especially those in difficult or hard-to-reach environments \nsuch as injecting drug users (IDUs), sex workers, clients of sex workers or people who are \nvulnerable because of their social isolation because of migration and/or work. NGOs and/or \nmass organizations offer a cost-effective mechanism for delivering services in innovative and \nflexible ways that will maximize the potential for impact among youth.  \n \n7.  Contracting Packages. As each of the three subcomponents has a distinct target \ngroup,  separate  organizations  (mass  or  non-government)  will  be  contracted  for  each \nsubcomponent. A single NGO or mass organization will be contracted to deliver services in five \nor ten provinces according to phase 1 and phase 2 of project implementation.1 Thus there will \nbe six contracts in three areas of service delivery with objectives and outputs as follows. \n(i)  Youth-friendly harm reduction services, including outreach voluntary counseling \nand testing (VCT), in each project province, targeted at youth with high-risk \nbehaviors and/or in high-risk settings, with the following outputs: \n\u2022  a harm reduction service, with VCT services, in a community setting; \n\u2022  technical  guidance  and  training  for  counselors,  nurses  and  laboratory \npersonnel; \n\u2022  social marketing for the service, especially in venues where youth with high-\nrisk behaviors are likely to be reached; \n\u2022  on-going quality review of VCT through observation, reporting, training of staff; \n\u2022  links  with  other  support  programs/activities,  including  health  services, \ncommunity and home\u2013based care; and \n\u2022  condoms, needles, syringes and project IPC materials distribute. \n \n(ii)  Peer education and life skills programs for vulnerable youth, including street \nyouth, youth working in services industries and factory workers, and a life skills \ntraining program for youth at vocational training or job recruitment centers with the \nfollowing specific outputs: \n\u2022  curriculum and plan of action for each training group based on a foundation of \nformative research and existing curricula; \n\u2022  participatory training course for peer educators at provincial and district levels; \n\u2022  supervised peer education programs at the community level in a variety of \nsettings with on-going support and in-service training; \n\u2022  life  skills  for  HIV/AIDS  awareness  curriculum  and  plan  of  action  for  each \nprovince; \n\u2022  participatory training courses for students in vocational and job recruitment \ncenters at provincial and district levels; and \n\u2022  regular monitoring and evaluation. \n \n \n1  The first three NGO contracts in three areas of service delivery will be awarded for phase 1 for activities in the five \nnorthern provinces, commencing activities in year 1 (see Appendix 5). The second three NGO contracts, each \nassociated with a specific area of service delivery, for activities in the remaining 10 provinces will begin in year 2. ", "  Appendix 11  51 \n(iii)  Training community collaborators and school-based educators in subjects that \ninclude  interpersonal  communication  skills,  counseling,  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually \ntransmitted  infection  (STI)  prevention,  community-based  care  and  support  for \nPLWHA,  effective  parenting  skills,  and  gender  awareness,  with  the  following \nspecific outputs: \n\u2022  curriculum and action plan for a training and outreach program for community \ncollaborators; \n\u2022  training courses using participatory methods across nominated topics; \n\u2022  supervision  of  outreach  program  implementation,  including  number  of \nhousehold and school visits, community consultations, etc; and \n\u2022  regular monitoring and evaluation to ensure relevance and effectiveness. \n \n8.  Selection Criteria. The selection criteria for each contract type will be adapted to the \nspecific service expected under the contract but in general will include: \n(i)  province-based service delivery experience in the specified area (e.g. VCT, peer \neducation and outreach, training of trainers); \n(ii)  HIV/AIDS-prevention-related  service  delivery  experience  in  the  targeted \nprovinces (or provinces with similar HIV/AIDS risk circumstances); and \n(iii)  experience with, and capacity for, managing internationally supported programs \nincluding those for financial management and reporting. \n \n9.  Selection and Contracting Process. Contracts for the provision of services by NGOs \nand/or mass organizations will be competitively awarded following procedures acceptable to \nADB. A single organization may bid on any number of contracts, but each bid will be evaluated \nindependently against other bids for the same contract. The project management unit (PMU) will \nmanage the selection and contracting process. A call for bids will be advertised locally and on \nADB\u2019s website. International NGOs will be eligible, as will local organizations. Bids will be \nevaluated  based  on  (i)  organizational  capacity  (expertise  and  resources  to  provide  the \nnominated service as well relevant experience); (ii) the strength of the technical proposal; and \n(iii) cost. Only NGOs from ADB member countries may be awarded contracts. \n \n10.  Contracts will be implemented on the basis of a lump sum contract, with quarterly \nprogress  payments  made  contingent  on  satisfactory  contractor  performance.  Contracts  will \nspecify objectively measurable service delivery goals to which payments are linked.  \n \n11.  Monitoring and Review. All contractors will be required to provide regular reporting to \nthe  PMU  according  to  government  and  ADB  procedures  and  the  reporting  schedule  and \nindicators set out in the contract. Contracts and services will be reviewed by ADB\u2019s regular \nproject review missions. \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \nTable A11.1 Individual Consulting Services by Position and Outputs \n \nPerson \nPosition  Outputs \nMonths \nInternational Consulting Services \n\u2022  Quality control on youth and HIV/AIDS focus in all project activities \n\u2022  Message development and dissemination strategies \nYouth and HIVAIDS Advisor  \u2022  Quality assurance for print media, website and mass media \n24 \n(WHO-recruited) a  \u2022  Participatory workshops for youth at national and provincial levels \n\u2022  Research on youth in relation to reproductive health and HIV/AIDS \n\u2022  Liaison on youth policy with international partners and Government \n\u2022  Functioning monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for project \n\u2022  Updated project indicators consistent with national M&E framework \n\u2022  Technical support to design and conduct of base-line, mid-term and \nfinal studies \nMonitoring and Evaluation \n18  \u2022  Training and coaching in M&E at provincial level for implementing \nAdvisor \nagencies \n\u2022  Training and support for PMU and PPMU staff \n\u2022  Monitoring visits to project sites and implementing agencies \n\u2022  Coordination with MOH and technical agencies on M&E indicators \n\u2022  Management training needs analysis for PMU and PPMU staff \n\u2022  Capacity building improvement program for PMU staff \n\u2022  In-house training program for staff at the PMU within first 6 months \nInstitutional Capacity Building \n12  of the project implementation \nAdvisor \n\u2022  Capacity building improvement program for PPMU staff and \nprovincial workshops within 12 months of provincial project activity \n\u2022  Assistance to PMU staff in phase 1 and preparations for phase 2. \nSubtotal (A)  54   \nDomestic Consulting Services \n\u2022  Ensure youth issues are emphasized in project activities. \nYouth Advisor (WHO-financed) a  \u2022  Quality assurance for media materials. \n24 \n  \u2022  Collaboration with the international consultant on leadership training.\n\u2022  Implementation support to project provinces. \n\u2022  Support PMU and PPMU to implement Gender Action Plan \nSocial development adviser  6 \n\u2022  Work with PPMUs to develop provincial action plans \n\u2022  To collaborate with the media agency for component 2. \n\u2022  Advise on cultural issues for media materials in Viet Nam. \nMedia specialist.  30 \n\u2022  Facilitate collaboration between ministries and institutions for \napproval processes with steering committee.  \nFinance, accounting and  \u2022  Computerized accounting and establish internal controls \n54 \nadministration   \u2022  Mid-term review support, project completion support. \nProject management systems  \u2022  Project management and monitoring system \n18 \nspecialist  \u2022  Support on mid-term review and project completion \nProject technical HIV/AIDS and \n78  \u2022  To monitor and progress activities of all project components \nyouth specialist \n\u2022  To monitor technical aspects and progress for component 3 \nProvincial technical HIV/AIDS \n150  activities at provincial level \nspecialists \n\u2022  Provide support on making provincial annual work-plan \nSubtotal (B)  360   \nTotal (A+B)  414   \nHIV/AIDS  =  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome;  M&E  =  monitoring  and \nevaluation; MOH = Ministry of Health; PMU = project management unit; PPMU = provincial project management unit; \nWHO = World Health Organization. \na  Under a project implementation agreement with WHO, this international adviser position will be managed by WHO \nin close consultation with ADB and VCPFC in order to strengthen links with and support from United Nations \nagencies.

No  in country poverty partnership agreement?    No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \nSickness and poor health is a major cause of impoverishment in Viet Nam. With the exception of households in the \nhighest income quintile, it is likely that all households that include a person living with HIV/AIDS will fall below the \npoverty line because of the income and expenditure effects of infection. Analysis shows that households in the third \nand fourth income quintiles who are affected by HIV/AIDS will become newly poor. Cost-effectiveness analyses rate \nHIV/AIDS prevention efforts among the best buys for public health and development in general. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nBy reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS and improving public health, the Project will make a positive contribution to \nreducing poverty, and the risk of poverty, through HIV/AIDS infection. This benefit extends not only to the young \npeople targeted by the Project but also to families who are inevitably burdened economically and socially by the need \nto support and care for an infected family member. This benefit extends especially to women (mothers and wives) who \nare almost always the family member providing care and support. \n \nThe economic effect of HIV/AIDS on households is severe and the poor are particularly at risk\u2014both to infection itself \nand to its economic effects. The benefits of economic growth have not been evenly distributed in Viet Nam and some \nsocial groups have missed out on the associated benefits. The maldistribution of these growth benefits is one of the \ncauses of increasing numbers of injecting drug users (IDUs) and sex workers, but it also has an effect among the \ngeneral population. A commitment to equity in the provision of HIV preventive activities is necessary to protect the \npoor from HIV transmission and to reduce the chances of impoverishment caused by HIV/AIDS, and to reduce the \npotential social and private costs of treatment and care. The public provision of effective HIV preventive services also \nincreases feelings of social security and social solidarity that have a flow-on effect in economic terms. The costs of \nhealth care in general, and the costs of HIV/AIDS care in particular, are a major cause of impoverishment in Viet Nam. \nFigures from the Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey 2002 indicate that household out-of-pocket spending \non health care accounts for at least 62% of total health expenditure.  \n \nThe Project will focus on populations and interventions where the impact of preventing infection will be greatest, the \nyoung (15\u201324). With their full working lives ahead of them and families to care for and support, the economic and/or \npoverty impact of HIV/AIDS infection is inevitably greatest when it occurs in this age group given the poor health and \nloss of productivity that inevitably follows. In addition, the Project will include interventions targeted at those young \npeople engaged in high-risk behaviors (e.g., sex work, drug use) and those vulnerable to adopting these high-risk \nbehaviors (e.g., migrants, the unemployed, and employees in high-risk sectors such as tourism), thereby increasing \nthe likelihood of preventing infection and poverty. Six of the project provinces have a poverty rate greater than the \nnational average. Several of the nominated provinces, including Hanoi, Danang, and Quang Ninh, have poverty rates \namong the lowest in the country. However, it must be noted that, within these provinces, those at greatest risk and \nmost affected by HIV/AIDS will be among the poorest in the province. Moreover, it is widely recognized that many of \nthe households most recently rising out of poverty\u2014also at great risk for HIV infection\u2014are only just above the poverty \nline and the impact of an HIV infection within the household could quickly see them plunge back into poverty. The \nProject will target and provide benefits to such households. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nA stakeholder analysis was completed during the design phase to identify and understand both the groups at risk of \nHIV infection and the potential partners in project implementation. For the potential partners, the analysis considered \nproject-related interests and the ways in which the respective stakeholders can affect project feasibility and success. \nPrimary stakeholders include, first and foremost, young people, as well as the VCPFC as Executing Agency, along \nwith MOH/VAAC, MOLISA, and MOET. These stakeholders will play an active role in the implementation of project \nactivities, and project activities in turn will have some effect on their operations. For the project activities that aim to \ndevelop support for the implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategy with a youth focus, stakeholders include \nnational and local government leaders and policy makers. Local and international NGOs will play a role as \nstakeholders and implementing agencies. Youth, as those at risk and targeted, will be actively involved throughout \nproject activities, including as key informants for the formative research, through employment in the television and \nradio production processes, and as peer educators. Mass organizations such as the Youth Union will also be involved. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nParticipation is integrated into the overall project design. VCPFC will coordinate closely with MOH in all activities \nrelated to the implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategy. The success of the mass media component, which ", "  Appendix 12  55 \nforms the centerpiece for all other project activities, will be closely related to the engagement of young people in the \nformative research and in the media production processes. The participation of other stakeholder ministries (MOLISA \nand MOET) and mass organizations (VWU and VYU) will also be critical to project success and is clearly defined in \nthe project design. The engagement of families through the education processes of the PCPFC collaborators will also \nensure broad participation at the community and family level in order to support young people as they make life \nchoices (education, employment, migration, relationships, and high-risk activities) that affect their overall HIV/AIDS risk. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAs in most countries, HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention in Viet Nam has important gender dimensions. This issue \nwas considered in great depth during the design phase and featured prominently in the poverty analysis, stakeholder \nanalysis, and the development of the participation strategy. Currently, 86% of all people living with HIV/AIDS are male \n(MoH 2005a), largely because the vast majority of injecting drug users are male. However, most sex workers are \nyoung women, and there is an increasing tendency for them to inject drugs, thus the risk profile of women is changing \nrapidly. Moreover, as more men become infected it is inevitable that the number of women infected will increase as a \nproportion of all infected as girlfriends and wives become infected by their partners. Normative gender roles are a \ncentral part of the risks faced by women. Women are also most likely to be the carers and supporters of infected men \nand thus bear a disproportionate share of the financial and social burden HIV/AIDS care. The achievement of the \nProject\u2019s purpose and objectives will have benefits for both women and men. Changing the perception of women\u2019s \nrisk, gender roles (especially in social relationships), and the perception of condom use will directly benefit women. \nThe messages conveyed through mass media materials, peer education, and other interpersonal communication \noutreach activities will directly address these perceptions and risks as they affect women.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

", " 56  Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Economic Rationale for Investing in HIV/AIDS Prevention among Youth \n \n1.  The case for a strong government role in HIV/AIDS prevention is based on the lack of \neffective private demand. Public funding of HIV/AIDS prevention activities is justified both as a \npublic good and by positive externalities. The services provided to the community through HIV \nprevention  activities  are  public  goods  for  which  the  consumption  by  a  single  individual  or \nhousehold does not affect the consumption choice of other individuals or households.  \n \n2.  The externalities associated with HIV prevention activities mean that the social benefits \nare greater than the private benefits: HIV prevention simultaneously protects the individual (from \ninfection)  and  the  community  (from  increased  rates  of  transmission).  Effective  prevention \nreduces the social costs of, and social spending on, health due to HIV/AIDS-related care.  \n \n3.  The implementation of effective preventive activities will reduce the cost to government \nof HIV-related treatment and care. Moreover, effective prevention activities have a long-term, \nintergenerational impact in protecting future generations from HIV both broadly, by reducing the \noverall level of infection, and more specifically, by reducing mother-to-child transmission. Viet \nNam has achieved significant improvements in child survival and adult productivity due to \nimproved nutrition and education. HIV/AIDS potentially undermines these achievements. In the \ncase of a private good, like the use of condoms, the positive externalities (reducing the risk of \nHIV transmission) are such that government subsidies to promote such behaviors are justified. \n \n4.  Studies have documented the value of youth-focused behavior change programs and \ninterventions, especially for youth practicing high-risk behaviors. In the case of youth-focused \ninterventions  in  India,  each  avoided  HIV  case  was  estimated  to  cost  $1,324.1  Similarly, \ninterventions targeting injecting drug users (IDUs) and sex workers were found to be highly \ncost-effective. Sex worker behavior change interventions were estimated to cost between $52 \nand $154 for each infection avoided while voluntary testing cost $199 per case avoided. Both of \nthese interventions are in the proposed Project. Intervention costs are significantly less than the \ncosts of treatment and care and the productivity loss that comes with infection and premature death.  \n \n5.  The nature of HIV prevention as a public good with positive externalities is reinforced by \nthe absence of market mechanisms available to address the identified needs. The private \nprovision of preventive services is unlikely. Insurance markets likewise will not provide cover for \npreventive programs for the reasons already established here. There is also limited, and in \nsome countries, nonexistent, access to insurance markets for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. \nEven where insurance may be available in the private market, it is accessible only to the \nwealthiest people. Additionally, lack of knowledge about the disease and the availability of \nservices, and the limitations in access to health services, especially among the poor, restricts \neffective demand for prevention services. \n \nB.  HIV/AIDS Prevention, Equity, and Poverty Reduction \n \n6.  The economic effect of HIV/AIDS on households is severe and the poor are particularly \nat  risk\u2014both  to  infection  itself  and  the  economic  effects  of  the  disease.  The  benefits  of \neconomic growth have not been evenly distributed in Viet Nam and some social groups have \nmissed out on the associated benefits. The maldistribution of these growth benefits is one of the \ncauses of increasing numbers of IDUs and sex workers, but it also has an effect on the general \npopulation. A commitment to equity in the provision of HIV preventive activities is necessary to \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  57 \nprotect the poor from HIV transmission and to reduce the chances of impoverishment caused by \nHIV/AIDS, and to reduce the potential social and private costs of treatment and care. The public \nprovision of effective HIV preventive services also acts to increase feelings of social security \nand social solidarity that have a flow-on effect in economic terms. \n \n7.  The costs of health care in general, and the costs of HIV/AIDS care in particular, are a \nmajor cause of impoverishment in Viet Nam. Figures from the Viet Nam Household Living \nStandards Survey (VHLSS) in 2002 indicate that household out-of-pocket spending on health \ncare accounts for at least 62% of total health expenditure. Moreover, financial access to health \nservices is much more limited for the poor than for the wealthy. VHLSS figures indicate that the \npoorest population income quintile spends only 17% as much as the richest income quintile on \nhealth care annually. Financial access for the poor to treatment (for example anti-retrovirals) is \neven more limited. Equity is therefore a strong argument for public spending on HIV prevention. \n \nC.  Economic Benefits of the Project \n \n8.  It is anticipated that the distributional effects of project activities will especially benefit the \npoor and the vulnerable and youth. Public distribution of preventive services will have most \nbenefit for people most at risk of HIV/AIDS, in this case the poor. By targeting youth, the Project \ncovers the biggest group of those likely to be infected, as well as low-income groups. It will \nreduce the likelihood of impoverishment caused by health costs related to HIV/AIDS treatment \nand care. \n \n9.  The 15 provinces have a combined population of approximately 14.9 million people aged \nbetween  15  and  49.  This  group  will  directly  benefit  from  the  strengthening  of  HIV/AIDS \neducation and prevention, and through the dissemination of information through mass media \nand community-based distribution methods. Parents will also be project beneficiaries as they \nwill be targeted by awareness-raising campaigns. \n \n10.  The primary outcome will be the number of HIV infections averted. Benefits of the \nProject will also be measured in terms of reductions in the losses of productivity, morbidity, and \nmortality due to infection, including the costs of curative care.  \n ", "58   Appendix 14   \nETHNIC MINORITY ISSUES AND ACTION FRAMEWORK \n \n1.  An ethnic minority action framework highlights the features of the Project that will need \nto be adapted and especially designed to ensure there are benefits for young people from ethnic \nminority populations in the targeted provinces. \n \nA.  Project Background \n \n2.  The Viet, or Kinh, people account for 88% of Viet Nam\u2019s population and are mostly live \nin the lowlands. There are 54 ethnic minority groups in Viet Nam. Most of their 5.5 million \nmembers live in mountainous areas. Major groups include the Tay (960,000 people), Hoa \n(930,000 people), Thai (770,000 people), Khmer (720,000 people), Muong (700,000 people), \nand H\u2019mong (441,000 people). Ethnic minority groups represent about 12% of Viet Nam\u2019s total \npopulation and about 28% of the total poor population. \n \n3.  Geographical  remoteness,  lower  human  development  levels,  and  slower  economic \ngrowth affect the economic and human development of ethnic minority populations. Measures of \nhealth status in particular are worse for ethnic minority populations, including infant mortality \nrates that are double those of the general population. Malaria, dengue, tuberculosis, typhoid, \nand cholera also occur at higher rates than in the broader population. \n \n4.  Across the region, changing trends in human migration, drug use, human trafficking, and \nthe sex trade have contributed to an increased risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS. While this has \ncontributed to a rapidly growing rate of HIV/AIDS infection in Viet Nam as a whole, among \nethnic minority groups the rate of increase is even faster than the national average. In the past, \nphysical isolation has offered some protection, but it has also limited access to preventive \neducation programs and campaigns. This particularly affects young people, who are more likely \nto leave the remote areas to travel to provincial capitals or beyond for education or employment. \nPoor  education  levels  and  health  status  also  increase  vulnerability.  Women  from  ethnic \nminorities are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking, and thus to the risk of \nHIV/AIDS infection. \n \n5.  The features of this Project that will especially target and benefit ethnic minority groups \nhave been developed based on the lessons learned from other HIV/AIDS projects that have \ntargeted  ethnic  minority  populations.  In  particular,  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \nproject Community Action for Preventing HIV/AIDS\u20191 addressed the needs of ethnic minority \ngroups  in  border  areas  of  Viet  Nam,  Cambodia,  and  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic. \nSimilarly, ADB\u2019s regional technical assistance (RETA) project on information, communication \nand  technology  (ICT)  and  HIV/AIDS  preventive  education2  addressed  issues  related  to \nHIV/AIDS prevention in vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities, using ICT and local \nlanguages  in  cross-border  areas.  Other  RETA  projects  addressed  prevention  in  mobile \npopulations,  including  ethnic  minority  groups,3  and  studied  and  developed  strategies  for \nimproving the health and education needs of ethnic minority groups in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion.4  \n \n1  ADB. 2001.

Legal Framework and Principles \n \n6.  The ethnic minority development framework for the Project is based on Vietnamese laws \nand ADB policy on indigenous peoples. ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples aims to protect \nethnic minorities from the adverse impacts of development, and to ensure that ethnic minority \ngroups  benefit  from  development  projects  and  programs.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam \nrecognizes  that  people  from  ethnic  minorities  tend  to  be  poor  and  underprivileged.  The \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy for 2001\u20132010 sets 11 goals, 6 of \nwhich deal with gender and ethnic minorities in ways that relate to the objectives of the Project: \n(i) achieve better education for all; (ii) reach gender equality and empower women; (ii) combat \nHIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  other  communicable  diseases;  (iv)  reduce  vulnerability;  and \n(vi) eradicate poverty and preserve ethnic minority culture. Complementing this strategy, the \nGovernment  has  issued  several  decrees  and  guidelines  that  aim  to  reduce  poverty  and \nvulnerability among ethnic minority populations, including several that aim to increase access to \nhealth services and training courses. \n \nC.  Implementation including Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n7.  Although  ethnic  minority  groups  in  the  15  provinces  are  culturally  diverse  and \nlinguistically complex, the Project intends to research and implement a targeted and appropriate \ncampaign to enhance benefits to ethnic minority populations, particularly among ethnic minority \nyouth. Through consultations with young people, community leaders, parents, and groups such as \nthe Youth Union, a range of actions across the project components will be implemented. \n \n8.  Implementation arrangements and estimated costs of the ethnic minority action plan are \npart of the overall project arrangements and total budget. The vice director of the project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be designated as the ethnic minority focal point, responsible for \nensuring all aspects of the action plan are accounted for. In provinces where ethnic minorities \nmake up more than 5% of the province\u2019s population, provincial project management units will \nalso have a nominated ethnic minority focal person. Nongovernment organizations contracted to \nimplement component 3 activities will all have to show evidence of some experience and in-\nhouse expertise with ethnic-minority-focused programs. \n \n9.  The monitoring of the ethnic minority action plan will be part of the overall system for the \nProject. The quarterly and annual reports will include a specific summary of progress toward \nimplementing the ethnic minority action plan. The midterm review will review these updates and \nadjustments to the action plan recommended based on lessons learned and actions to date. \n \nD.  Project Benefits \n \n10.  The Project will seek to identify and address the specific issues of HIV/AIDS prevention \nand risk among ethnic minority youth. The communication strategy will improve the knowledge \nof HIV prevention among ethnic minority youth and aim to reduce high-risk behaviors. The \nProject will improve dialogue between young people and local and national policy makers. \n \n11.  Beyond the national media campaign, the Project will target 19 million people in 15 \nprovinces, including approximately 220,000 members of ethnic minority groups, particularly in \nHa Tay and Dien Bien provinces. While there are no specific data on the numbers of young \npeople in the target age group from ethnic minority groups in the provincial populations, using \nthe overall percentage it is likely that the Project will benefit 46,000 young people from ethnic \nminorities. This may be a conservative estimate, as it is likely the proportion of the population \nthat is young in the ethnic minority population groups is greater than for the population overall.
