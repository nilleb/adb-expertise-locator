THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based grant to the Republic of Kiribati for the Strengthening Fiscal Stability Program \n(SFSP).  \n \n2.  The program is designed to help the Government of Kiribati increase fiscal sustainability \nby improving (i) public expenditure quality, (ii) revenue performance, (iii) management of public \nassets and liabilities, and (iv) the business environment.1 Policy actions supported under the \nstand-alone policy-based grant are part of a government-led, multi-year and multi-partner reform \neffort under the Kiribati Economic Reform Plan (KERP) and are implemented from 1 January to \n31  December  2014.2 A  post-program  partnership  framework  supports  sustainability  of  the \nprogram. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Kiribati\u2019s  fragile,  small  Pacific  island  economy  faces  the  challenges  of  geographic \nisolation, limited human and financial resources, and a narrow economic base. It is extremely \nvulnerable  to  external  shocks  due  to  its  high  exposure  to  climate  change,  severe  import \ndependency, and heavy reliance on income from external sources making economic growth \nhighly volatile. The country\u2019s private sector is small and restricted by high transport costs and a \nlimited production base. The large public sector crowds out entrepreneurial activity because its \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  operate  in  potentially  competitive  sectors.3 Development \nperformance indicators are poor, and vulnerability is widespread.4 \n \n1.  The Kiribati Economy \n4.  The  2008\u20132009  global  economic  crisis  contributed  to  successive  contractions  of \nKiribati\u2019s economy in 2009 and 2010. Largely driven by donor-financed infrastructure projects, \ngrowth stabilized at close to 3% per annum during 2011\u20132013.5 Expanded opportunities for \nprivate sector participation in the retail trade sector (through SOE reforms) provided a further \nboost  to  economic  activity.  Without  autonomous  monetary  policy  due  to  the  use  of  the \nAustralian dollar, the government has depended on fiscal policy to manage the impact of shocks \nand stimulate inclusive growth. To finance fiscal deficits of 7%\u201321% of gross domestic product \n(GDP) during 2009\u20132012, the government relied heavily on drawdowns from the Revenue \nEqualization Reserve Fund (RERF). The RERF had an estimated value of A$668 million at the \nend of 2013, equivalent to 381% of GDP, but drawdowns and losses on RERF investments \nduring the global economic crisis contributed to an almost 50% reduction of the fund\u2019s balance \nin  real  per  capita terms  since 2000  limiting  the government\u2019s  ability  to manage  economic \nvolatility and react to shocks over the long term. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. Development partners are engaged in ongoing policy reform dialogue related to \nthe KERP and assist its implementation through technical assistance, even when providing budget financing on an \nintermittent basis. \n3  Government spending is around 100% of gross domestic product, coinciding with high import dependency. \n4  World Bank. 2014.

The government\u2019s current revenues have risen from an average of 42.5% of GDP in \n2009\u20132011  to  an  average  of  about  62.0%  in  2012\u20132013  driven  by  strong  fishing  license \nrevenue  through  the  implementation  of  the  vessel  day  scheme  in  2012.6 However,  these \nincreases in fishing license revenue\u2014from 17.4% to 50.5% of GDP in 2011 to 2013\u2014masked \nan overall decline in tax receipts, which fell from 17.7% to 15.9% of GDP over the same period, \ndue to a narrow tax base, weak tax compliance, and the poor performance by SOEs leading to \nforegone tax payments. Given its highly volatile revenue base, the government has exercised \nexpenditure restraint. The public sector wage bill remained constant in real terms during 2007\u2013\n2012, and overall real expenditure declined by 13%. SOE subsidies remain high, however, at \n4% of GDP in 2012. The government posted an estimated overall fiscal surplus of 10.3% of \nGDP in 2013 due to better fishing conditions and the substantial rise in fishing license fees since \n2012. Still, it will take time to restore the RERF to sustainable levels. \n \n2.  Medium-Term Fiscal Framework \n6.  To develop the economy, increase its resilience to external shocks, and eventually \nreduce individual hardship and vulnerability in Kiribati, the government aims to steadily improve \nfiscal sustainability and stabilize the RERF through the adoption of a fiscal framework in 2012 in \nconsultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The framework includes long-term \nfiscal projections of the current fiscal deficits and real per capita balances in the RERF for a \npolicy stagnation and three reform scenarios.7 This program supports the implementation of \npolicy actions under the strong reform scenario while the policy stagnation scenario serves as \nthe baseline. In both scenarios, development projects currently under implementation contribute \nto  sustained  growth  over  the  near  term  up  to  2016.  In  the  strong  reform  scenario,  fiscal \nadjustment needs to be gradual to avert strong negative effects on the economy and living \nstandards. A pickup in private sector activity is projected to compensate for the negative effects \nof this gradual fiscal consolidation during 2015\u20132018. This leads to the same growth levels as in \nthe baseline scenario over this period (Table). Fiscal reform efforts in the strong reform scenario \nresult in increased tax revenue collection and reduced current expenditures, contributing to \nimproved fiscal sustainability. \n \n7.  While avoiding further exposure of the fund to excessive risks is important, RERF long-\nterm  performance  will  depend  greatly  on  the  drawdowns  to  finance  current  fiscal  deficits. \nDrawdown levels are linked to the undertaking and success or failure of policy reforms to \npromote growth and limit fiscal pressures. Long-run growth in 2020\u20132034 under the policy \nstagnation scenario is projected at 1.9%. Instead, stronger fiscal consolidation is expected to \nreduce public sector-driven growth significantly. This is projected to be partly offset by greater \nprivate sector activity that will support growth of about 1.8% by 2020 under the strong reform \nscenario.8 The policy stagnation scenario projects current fiscal deficits of more than 11% of \nGDP from 2020 onward and an almost complete depletion of RERF resources by 2030. The \nstrong-reform scenario, however, would reduce the current fiscal deficit to about 3.6% of GDP \nand stabilize the RERF\u2019s real per capita value at A$3,843 (in 2006 prices) by 2024 (Figure). \n                                                \n6  The scheme was implemented in 2012 by eight Pacific countries that are the parties to the Nauru Agreement. The \nscheme sets a total number of vessel-days to be allocated between the countries for sale to fishing fleets. The \nscheme aims at raising fishing license fees while safeguarding the sustainability of the Pacific\u2019s tuna stocks. \n7  IMF. 2014. Kiribati Article IV Consultation 2014. Washington, DC.

Kiribati Economic Reform Plan \n8.  To restore fiscal sustainability, the government has embarked on a wide-ranging reform \nprogram of concrete policy actions as defined in the KERP 2013\u20132014. The KERP is a medium-\nterm reform program, developed jointly by government\u2013development partner collaborative effort \nto  improve  fiscal  sustainability.9 In  line  with  Kiribati  Development  Plan  (KDP),  2012\u20132015 \npriorities, the KERP aims to improve (i) expenditure quality, (ii) revenue performance, (iii) the \nmanagement of public assets and liabilities, and (iv) the business environment supported by the \ndevelopment  partners.10 The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World  Bank,  and  the \nGovernment of New Zealand will be providing (i) budget support in a sequenced manner to \nsupport stabilization of the RERF and set incentives to maintain reform momentum, and (ii) \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  reform  implementation.11 The  KERP  incorporates  the \nlessons from ADB\u2019s experience in policy-based operations in the Cook Islands, the Marshall \nIslands, Nauru, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu, as well as the experience of the \nother development partners across the region, including in Kiribati.12 Lessons incorporated in \nthe KERP include the need to (i) build strong political consensus for reform, (ii) limit reform to a \nfew substantive areas, (iii) institutionalize a joint government\u2013partner coordination mechanism, \nand  (iv)  adopt  a  medium-term  perspective  that  recognizes  the  severity  of  the  reform \nchallenges.13 \n \n9.  To demonstrate its commitment to reform, in 2013, the current government (i) approved \nlegislation to improve tax compliance and to introduce a value-added tax (VAT) to broaden the \nrevenue  base,  (ii)  reduced  the  number  of  temporary  workers  in  ministries  delivering  non-\nessential services, thereby curbing salary expenditures, (iii) approved a debt policy to prevent \nnew  nonconcessional  borrowing,  (iv)  established  a  RERF  investment  committee,  (v) \nsuccessfully privatized two SOEs and approved a private sector strategy,14 (vi) upgraded the \npublic financial management (PFM) information system, and (vii) approved a national fisheries \npolicy  to  strengthen  resource  management  and  maximize  license  revenues.  ADB  TA  has \nprovided crucial support to help the government implement SOE reform.15  \n \n10.  The  government  is  committed  to  continuing  reforms  through  the  rest  of  its  current \nmandate, which is expected to run until elections due in late 2015. It has requested budget \nfinancing from its development partners to help stabilize the RERF and provide incentives for \nfurther important reforms. In response, ADB has prepared the SFSP as a stand-alone policy-\nbased operation that will support fiscal management and structural reform\u2014areas of historical \n                                                \n9  Government of Kiribati.

However, they also recognize the need to \nmaintain basic social services and the importance of subsidies and wages to support livelihoods and as a form of \nsocial protection. Abrupt fiscal adjustment would jeopardize development outcomes and further deepen hardship \nand vulnerabilities. \n14 Implementation is supported by development partners through investments in transport infrastructure, financial, \nand energy sector development; telecommunication sector liberalization; and skills development. \n15 ADB. 2008.

The SFSP is consistent with the KDP; ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, \n2010\u20132014; and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Kiribati for 2010\u20132014.16  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be improved fiscal sustainability in Kiribati, as prioritized in the KDP and \nin line with the government\u2019s fiscal framework and the KERP. The impact will be measured \nagainst targets for improvement in the RERF\u2019s real per capita value and the government\u2019s \ncurrent  fiscal  deficit.  The  outcome  of  the  program  will  be  government  capacity  for  fiscal \nstabilization built. Outcome progress will be tracked against targets for increased VAT revenue \ncollection and reduced subsidies to SOEs.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The outputs align with four priority policy reform goals that put the country on a path \ntoward fiscal stability. The SFSP aims to improve (i) the quality of public expenditure, (ii) \nrevenue performance, (iii) the management of public assets and liabilities, and (iv) the business \nenvironment. All 12 policy actions under the program have been completed. \n \n13.  Output 1: Improved quality of expenditure. Kiribati\u2019s economy is heavily dependent \non public expenditure. There is limited scope at this point to reduce spending on wages or core \nsocial services without negatively affecting social outcomes and livelihoods, but expenditure \nquality can be improved by rationalizing SOE subsidies. A government review of its copra \nsubsidy  scheme  concluded  that  Kiribati\u2019s  coconut  industry  is  not  financially  viable.  The \ninvolvement of six agencies in administration of the subsidy has also led to poor coordination, \nunnecessary double handling of products, and limited accountability leading to a \u201cleakage\u201d of \nabout 40% of the subsidy in 2010 ($2.1 million) and 2011 ($3.6 million).17 The government aims \nto replace copra subsidies in the long term with a better-targeted form of social assistance, but \nthis will take time, given the reliance on the copra subsidy in Kiribati society. The cabinet \napproved the review recommendation to merge the Kiribati Copra Mill and the Kiribati Copra \nCooperative Society into a single SOE responsible for the entire sector. This will increase \naccountability, makes cost structures more transparent, and improves efficiency and reduces \nleakages. The merger will ensure that copra subsidies achieve their main purpose of supporting \nlivelihoods in the outer islands until a better transfer scheme is designed. \n \n14.  The government has also prioritized implementation of core provisions of the 2013 SOE \nAct to minimize the fiscal drain to inefficient SOEs through the replacement of subsidies with \ncommunity service obligations (CSOs).18 All subsidies to SOEs were cut in the 2015 budget \nprocess. The new process requires SOEs to submit CSO bids to the Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Development (MFED) during the budget process. This has formed the basis for a \ntransparent CSO negotiation process between MFED and SOEs in which costs can be clearly \nassigned to specific services. These negotiations reduce wastage and provide the government \nwith better value for money and allow for more strategic resource allocation. \n \n15.  Output 2: Improved revenue administration. With assistance from the Government of \nAustralia and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center, the government implemented \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2009.

This was in response to declining revenues from personal \nincome  and  company  taxes  and  a  phasing  out  of  trade  taxes.  Sound  implementation  is \nexpected to at least offset the loss of revenue from the phased-out import duties within the first \nyear of full implementation in 2015, broaden the tax base in the long run, and increase overall \ntax revenue yield. The SFSP supported these efforts by reviewing VAT implementation over the \nfirst quarter. It identified bottlenecks and capacity gaps that are being addressed by government \nin collaboration with the development partners supporting revenue administration in Kiribati. \n \n16.  Receipts from  tuna fishing  license fees  represent  40%\u201370%  of  current government \nrevenue in 2009\u20132013. There is a need to ensure that such information on the fishing license \nrevenue  is  shared  properly  by  agencies  within  the government.  A  lack  of transparency  in \nfisheries license agreements creates uncertainty in the projection of revenues. It also likely \nreduces the amounts remitted to the government general account. The program established a \njoint committee between the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resource Development and the \nMFED to facilitate collaboration and information sharing on fishing license revenue between the \ntwo  ministries.  The  committee  produced  a  report  detailing  collections  for  2013  under  the \nprogram,  which  provides  the  basis  for  a  planned  analysis  and  review  of  fishing  license \nagreements aimed at achieving government policy objectives. This intragovernment information \nsharing is a first step toward optimizing the fisheries sector and (i) enables the government\u2019s \nbudget team to  make meaningful  projections, thereby  improving  budget  credibility;  and (ii) \nallows the MFED to make a reliable assessment and advise the cabinet on whether Kiribati is \n(a) maximizing the sustainability and value of its fisheries resources through existing and future \nlicense agreements and joint venture arrangements, and (b) complying with catch limits and \nother conditions established under regional frameworks. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Improved  management  of  public  assets  and  liabilities.  Sound \nmanagement  of  the  RERF  assets  is  another  key  to  restoring  fiscal  sustainability.  Losses \nincurred  on  investments  during  the  global  economic  crisis  highlighted  inadequacies  in  the \nmanagement arrangements. A review of the RERF management recommended (i) improving \nalignment between strategic asset allocation and investment objectives, (ii) revising investment \nguidelines  to  remove  ambiguity  and  avoid  excessive  risk  taking,  and  (iii)  adopting  more \nappropriate mechanisms for monitoring and assessing the performance of asset managers. The \nSFSP  required  the  cabinet  to  approve  and  implement  these  reforms  to  achieve  greater \nalignment between RERF management and strategy objectives. This included the reallocation \nof the RERF\u2019s assets to new asset managers, who will operate under set guidelines, and the \nreorientation of the portfolio towards lower-risk instruments. Asset allocation is to be 25% in \npublic equities and 75% in bonds. \n \n18.  The government\u2019s fiscal position also suffers from weak debt management. The results \nhave included (i) accumulation of substantial debt at high interest rates, including the use of a \nhigh-interest overdraft facility, despite the government\u2019s ability to access financing at a lower \ncost from the RERF, (ii) a lack of information on how much debt is outstanding, and (iii) the \ncontracting of government debt and guarantees without the knowledge of all cabinet members \nor appropriate advice from the MFED. The SFSP supported implementation of a new debt policy \nadopted by the government in 2013 and required the MFED to appoint an officer dedicated to \ndebt policy monitoring. This is intended to (i) ensure that loan and guarantee decisions are \nbased on appropriate advice and guided by strategic policy considerations; (ii) avoid recourse to \nexpensive commercial borrowing; and (iii) prevent reaccumulation of overdraft balances and the \ninappropriate granting of further loan guarantees to SOEs and joint ventures. \n \n ", "7 \n \n19.  Output 4: Improved structural reform implementation. Inefficient SOEs dominate \nlarge  parts  of  the  economy  crowding  entrepreneurial  activity  out  of  potentially  competitive \nsectors and drain government fiscal resources. ADB TA projects have supported the significant \nSOE reform efforts undertaken by the government since 2012 (footnotes 11). These led to the \npassing  of  the  SOE  Act  in  2013,  initiation  of  restructuring  and  privatization  processes  for \nselected SOEs, and an improved oversight framework that brought about better corporate \ngovernance.  The  government\u2019s  SOE  reform  road  map  has  identified  specific  SOEs  for \nrestructuring to improve SOE efficiency and promote private sector participation in the economy. \nThe SFSP supported the restructuring of four SOEs\u2014the Kiribati Shipping Services; the Plant \nand Vehicle Unit (PVU), which purchases and maintains government vehicles; Bobotin Kiribati, \na food wholesaler; and Betio Shipyard. To improve SOE efficiency and reduce the fiscal drain, \nthe SFSP required SOEs to develop statements of intent that include projections for cash flows, \nannual balance sheets, and annual profits; submit financial statements for audit; and ensure that \nall board appointments are in full compliance with the act. An exception to the latter requirement \ninvolves the advisory committee of the PVU. This is due to legal ambiguity over whether the \nPVU falls under the SOE Act or is a special fund as defined in the PVU Act. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n20.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $3.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (i) to help meet the financing gap for the 2014 fiscal year; and (ii) to incentivize \nthe political approval and technical implementation of the KERP policy reform actions needed to \ngradually  move  toward fiscal  sustainability  in  the  long  term. The government forecasts  its \nfinancing requirements for 2014 to be $37.1 million (22.6% of GDP), $26.9 million in 2015 \n(15.8%  of  GDP),  and  $25.6  million  in  2016  (14.5%  of  GDP).  These  estimates  project  a \nsubsequent decline of these needs to a sustainable level of 3.6% of GDP by 2025. The ADB, \nthe Government of New Zealand, and the World Bank jointly support the implementation of the \nKERP, with the two partners providing collaborative cofinancing of Kiribati\u2019s budget in 2014 in \nthe amount of $0.9 million (New Zealand) and $8.2 million (World Bank). This joint assistance \nallows the government to reduce RERF drawdowns by $12.1 million in 2014 and contributes to \nthe fund\u2019s  long-term  stabilization.  Continuous financial  support  by  development  partners  is \nexpected over the medium term within the programmatic framework of the KERP. \n \n21.  The successful implementation of the SFSP will (i) immediately save the government \nover $2.0 million in subsidies in 2015 by reducing leakages (para. 13); (ii) allow better use of \ngovernment funds and a reduction of wastage through use of CSOs (para. 14), (iii) reduce \npublic  debt  to  $1.0  million  by  2015  and  save  future  servicing  costs  through  better  debt \nmanagement,  and  (iv)  reduce  fiscal  risks  from  SOEs  and  thereby  limit  potential  negative \nimplications on the budget. On the revenue side, the government is expected to generate \nrevenue of $12.4 million in 2014 (7.6% of GDP) from VAT increasing to 10.2% of GDP by 2019 \n(para. 15). The government is also making progress in substantially increasing fisheries license \nfee revenues (para. 16). ADB determined the proposed program grant amount based on the \navailable  Asian  Development  Fund  allocation  for  Kiribati,  the  government\u2019s  progress  in \nimplementing its ambitious reform agenda, and the need to maximize leverage for political \napproval and technical implementation of the KERP policy reform actions.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  Program  management.  The  MFED,  as  the  executing  agency,  oversees  timely \nimplementation of the agreed policy actions by the implementing agencies and is responsible for \nprogram administration, disbursements, and maintaining all records. The MFED acts as the joint \n ", "8 \nimplementing agency with the Ministry of Commerce, Industries, and Cooperatives for output 1; \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Marine  Resource  Development  on  reporting  fisheries \nrevenues for output 2; and with the Ministry of Communication, Transportation, and Tourism \nDevelopment and the Ministry of Public Works and Utilities for outputs 3 and 4. To help deliver \nthese last two outputs, it works through an established SOE reform steering committee that \ncomprises the secretaries from these ministries, an official from the Lands Department, and the \nsecretary to the cabinet. ADB and other development partners have provided and will continue \nto make available TA support to help the government accomplish the policy actions and achieve \nprogram outcomes (footnote 11). Program and post-program partnership framework monitoring \nwill be carried out by the MFED, complemented by oversight by the economic working group of \nthe government and development partners that monitors KERP implementation.19 \n \n23.  Implementation  period.  The  program  is  being  implemented from  1  January  to  31 \nDecember 2014, consistent with the government\u2019s medium-term fiscal framework and budget \ncycle.  \n \n24.  Procurement and disbursement. The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for policy-based \ngrants.20 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.21 Grant proceeds disbursed against \nimports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value of the total \nimports of Kiribati, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance, is greater than the amount of the grant \nexpected to be disbursed in 2014. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n25.  Tranches and counterpart funds. The grant will be provided in a single tranche and \nmay be withdrawn upon satisfaction of grant effectiveness conditions\u2014i.e., fulfillment of all \nprogram policy actions (Appendix 4). Local currency generated from the grant will be directed to \nthe government\u2019s bank account with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group to allow \nfinancial assistance for the 2014 budget. \n \n26.  Program  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  government  monitors  the \nimplementation and outcome of the SFSP, using a set of indicators and targets that has been \nagreed between the government and ADB. For each of the agreed indicators, progress is \nmeasured against the baselines in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The \nresponsible implementing agencies support the review of agreed actions to determine progress \nand identify constraints. Because the outcome of the program will be felt beyond the period of \nits implementation, the MFED will continue monitoring program performance until the end of \n2015, and KERP monitoring will be carried out on a continuous basis by the economic working \ngroup of the government and development partners. The information from this monitoring will be \nincluded in the program completion report. \n \n                                                \n19 The economic working group is composed of representatives from the government and development partners, \nincluding ADB, and is chaired by the secretary for finance and economic development. \n20 ADB. 1998.

Strengthened fiscal management and budget restraint by the government will slow the \ndeterioration of the RERF\u2019s real per capita value.22 The IMF projects that this value will stand at \nA$4,192 (in 2006 Australian dollars) in 2018 with the implementation of reforms supported by \nthe SFSP, compared with A$3,760 if policy stagnates and no reforms are undertaken. The \ncurrent fiscal deficit is also projected to reduce to 12.7% of GDP in 2018, compared with 21.6% \nif policy does not change. These improvements will result in a more sustainable fiscal position \nover the long term and build the government\u2019s ability to respond to external shocks. Individual \nreform actions will improve the quality of expenditures, strengthen the government\u2019s revenue \nposition, and improve the management of assets and liabilities, while opening up selected \nsectors to private competition with the aim of increasing employment and reducing consumer \nprices.  \n \nB.  Governance \n28.  A  2010  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  identified \nweaknesses  in  the  government\u2019s  PFM  systems.23 Since  then,  development  partners  have \nhelped the government design and implement a PFM plan for 2011\u20132014 by (i) putting in place \na  medium-term  budget  framework  to  underpin  strategic  allocation  of  resources,  (ii) \nstrengthening  the  customs  and  tax  departments  for  VAT  implementation,  (iii)  developing \ncapacity of the National Economic and Planning Office to improve planning and budgeting \nlinkages, (iv) strengthening the government\u2019s Accounting Department in the use of accounting \nsoftware and preparation of financial reports, and (iv) developing external audit capacities.24 \n \n29.  A review of the public procurement system was undertaken in 2012\u20132013. As indicated \nin the post-program partnership framework, the government is planning to implement proposed \nchanges by mid-2015. PFM reform actions have also been supported by the KERP. The PFM \nsystem upgrade that introduced a commitment control system allows the MFED to control \nbudget execution across the government. A PFM advisor, financed by the European Union, will \nbe engaged to support downstream PFM functions and capacity development in early 2015. \nThese  achievements  and  the  post-program  partnership  framework  demonstrate  the \ngovernment\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  credible  and  effective  budget  management.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n30.  Fiscal stabilization will have positive impacts on the delivery of social services in Kiribati. \nRedundancies will be avoided during SOE rationalization, and some SOE workers will transition \ninto the private sector as this takes on the SOE functions. Others will be retained in the public \nsector.25 \n                                                \n22 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management and Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund: Overview \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n23 Government of Kiribati. 2010.

Program activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none of the \nactivities  will  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  peoples. \nSafeguard categories for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples are all \nC. No adverse environmental impacts have been identified. Public consultations were carried \nout during the processing of the program. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The program\u2019s overall risk is rated medium, with three key risk factors identified.26 With \nelections due in 2015, the political consensus needed to achieve the intended fiscal and SOE \nmanagement reforms may prove more difficult to obtain than is anticipated. Staff turnover in \nMFED could leave too few qualified and experienced personnel to manage implementation of \nprogram elements. Kiribati\u2019s extreme vulnerability to shocks could diverge fiscal indicators from \nthose envisaged and targeted. The program has been designed to mitigate these risks. The \npost-program  partnership  framework  constitutes  a  mitigation  strategy  against  potential \nweakening of the government reform commitment. Political consensus is being obtained and \nsustained  through  government  ownership  and  leadership  of  the  KERP  process  and  by \ncontinuous outreach to parliamentarians and the general public building on an already high level \nof media coverage and public awareness to build wide stakeholder support for reform and the \nrole of development partners in supporting the government\u2019s efforts through budget financing \nand TA. To help offset the risk of skills shortages, government staff resources are supplemented \nthrough  ADB  and  other  development  partners\u2019  TA  projects.  Fiduciary  risks  have  been \naddressed through the PFM reform plan activities (paras. 28\u201329). \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the grant agreement. The grant will become effective after ADB is satisfied that \nall conditions for the release of the program tranche, as specified in the policy matrix and set out \nin Attachment 2 to Schedule 2 of the draft grant agreement, have been complied with. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve the grant not exceeding $3,000,000 to the Republic of Kiribati from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  for  the  Strengthening  Fiscal  Stability  Program,  on  terms  and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nBindu N.
