INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster aims to mainstream impact \nevaluation1 (IE) to improve the development effectiveness of project and policy interventions in \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs). The TA will (i) support IE \nstudies of ADB-financed sovereign interventions or pilot interventions under consideration for \nfinance, and (ii) increase the awareness and capacity of DMCs to carry out IE and use IE results. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the ADB Management approved 2019 results-based workplan of \nADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB commits more than $30 billion each year to investments (inclusive of cofinancing), \nbut empirical evidence regarding the attributable impacts of the financed interventions remains \nlimited. Following project completion, self-evaluations are conducted to rate performance and are \nsubject to validation by  ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department. In selected cases, the \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department  conducts  project  performance  evaluations,  and  rating \npatterns are synthesized in various evaluation studies. However, these analyses typically do not \nprovide empirical estimates of the effects of project interventions on outcomes of interest, and \nunderstanding of these effects often remains rooted in assumptions that have not been empirically \ntested. \n  \n4.  This has remained so, even as the development profession has increasingly recognized \nthe need for rigorous IE methodologies (including randomized experiments and appropriate \neconometric approaches) to isolate the effects of interventions from those of confounding factors.3 \nThe number of rigorous IEs published annually has risen from tens of studies around year 2000 \nto over 500 by 2015.4 During this period, the conduct of IEs to test development interventions has \nbecome a central focus of the world\u2019s top research economists, including those awarded the 2019 \nNobel Prize in economics.5 The conduct of IEs has greatly expanded in other international \nfinancial institutions, where hundreds are now ongoing. Fast-paced private industries, such as \ninformation technology, medicine, and marketing, have also rapidly escalated the use of IE \nmethods to test consumer responses to innovations before they are scaled widely. Beyond \noffering findings to inform improvements, the process of IE has also been found to improve project \nimplementation by clarifying key assumptions, so that projects have fewer delays and faster \ndisbursement.6 \n \n5.  In parallel, recent developments in data collection technologies and analysis tools present \nopportunities to undertake IEs that are nimble and can more rapidly respond to operational needs. \nVery large data sets (\u201cbig data\u201d) are increasingly collected and available through automated \n \n1  Impact evaluation refers to empirical estimates of the effects of interventions and their statistical significance. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 October 2019. \n3  Examples of recent innovations include development of the \u201csynthetic controls\u201d method; refinements to propensity \nscore approaches, such as machine learning-based propensity score estimation; and double robust regression, \nmarginal treatment effects models, and improved correlated random coefficients models. \n4  H.

Administrative information is increasingly available, and the coverage and \nquality of microdata from national statistical systems are increasing in many DMCs. Computerized \nservice delivery can also enable new forms of large-scale experiments to rapidly test innovations. \n \n6.  IE is essential to strengthen ADB\u2019s role as a knowledge provider, as outlined in Strategy \n2030.7 Initially,  IEs  at  ADB  were  largely  carried  out  through  individual  efforts  of  regional \ndepartments. Recognizing the need for a more systematic approach to measure project outcomes \nand impacts, ERCD developed a research and development TA titled Implementing Impact \nEvaluation at ADB in 2010, which funded five pilot IEs.8 This work was supplemented in 2013 with \nTA cluster (CTA) 0012-REG: Developing Impact Evaluation Methodologies, Approaches, and \nCapacities in Selected Developing Member Countries to support (i) about 15 IE study phases \ndistributed over ADB\u2019s regional departments and ERCD, (ii) the development of IE methodologies, \nand (iii) awareness raising and capacity building on IE among the DMCs.9 Under both TA projects, \nIE was to have support from ERCD, but conduct remained largely an regional department \nresponsibility. Providing evidence-based policy recommendations aligns with the value addition \nsought by ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. \n \n7.  CTA 0012 initiated 19 IE studies (21 study phases) covering 8 sectors in 11 DMCs. It led \nto 4 conferences, 10 seminars, an IE portal, IE reviews on energy and transport, and an IE \nguidebook. As a result, awareness and momentum have increased at ADB for conducting IE.  \n \n8.  Although CTA 0012 initiated many studies, few have been completed to date, in part \nbecause IEs often require multiple surveys spanning prior and post-project implementation. The \ninitiated IEs have not all had consistent technical oversight from regional departments, some of \nwhich lack staff with a background in IE. As a result, some initiated IEs have insufficient sample \nsizes, survey design limitations, or other problems that impede successful conclusion. \n \n9.  More effective mainstreaming of IE requires improved support. Continued support is \nneeded to ensure that promising studies that have been initiated are completed, and appropriate \nnew studies are initiated. In addition, support needs to be improved by consistently ensuring that \nfinancial resources are accompanied by appropriate technical expertise and oversight through \nmore of a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, in which research economists from ERCD can be fully engaged \nin studies along with global experts who may be associated with other networks or agencies \n(possible examples include the Jamal-Latif Poverty Action Lab, Innovations for Poverty Action or \nIDinsight).10 TA support to IE studies will be further improved to focus support more strategically \nto add value to operations. This includes (i) adopting nimble approaches for IEs to enable more \nrapid completion, (ii) targeting understudied themes, and (iii) supporting IE of pilot interventions \nunder consideration for future investments. Thus, additional resources will be required to (i) \nsupport ongoing IE studies for completion, (ii) support new IE studies; (iii) disseminate study \nfindings and lessons, and (iv) contribute to capacity building of DMC stakeholders. \n \n \n7  ADB. 2018.

JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n10.  The envisaged effect of the TA is that IE is mainstreamed to a greater degree in ADB \noperations, resulting in better-designed investments in DMCs.11  Although innovative approaches \ncan help in conducting cost-effective and timely IEs, many IEs may take more than 5 years to \ncomplete, because project implementation can take years, and additional years may be needed \nbefore effects of interest can be observed. Long-term commitment is needed to support studies \nthrough this process. An individual freestanding TA would either have long periods of committed \nresources with little disbursement (if all survey rounds are funded), or will create uncertainty about \nwhether funds are available to complete IEs (if only individual survey rounds are funded). Use of \na TA cluster modality to finance individual rounds of data collection allows flexibility for this \nsituation. A cluster with a phased series of subprojects ensures that future funds will be available, \nwhile committing funds only to activities with near-term disbursements for the initial subprojects. \nBy establishing a substantial central funding pool, the TA cluster enables strategic selection of \nIEs with the greatest potential, while reducing costs otherwise devoted for processing individual \nstudies as stand-alone TA projects. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n11.  The  TA  cluster  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact  derived  from  Strategy  2030: \ndevelopment effectiveness of ADB finance and partnerships enhanced.7 The TA cluster will have \nthe following outcome: consideration of evidence on the effectiveness of interventions in ADB \noperations and discussions informing DMC policies expanded.12 The TA cluster will have three \nsubprojects and two outputs. \n \n12.  Output 1: Impact evaluation studies conducted. This will support the conduct of at least \n15 IE study phases, while maintaining regional and sector balance. IE studies will be applied to \nADB  investments  or  pilot  interventions  for  informing  future  ADB  investments.  The  TA  will \nstrategically support IE studies from beginning to end, ensure that previously initiated IEs are \ncompleted, and encourage low-cost and nimble approaches, especially on understudied themes. \nIt may also support key phases of individual studies, with other phases financed independently.13 \nThe TA also will support collaboration with leading research partners on rigorous IE analysis and \npublish high-quality ADB reports and research papers. It may also allocate limited funding for \ndiagnostic work to scope promising IE study possibilities and prepare proposals. \n \n13.  Output 2: Impact evaluation awareness and capacity enhanced. This output will entail \n(i) reviewing IE methodologies and results for sectors and themes, and producing synthesis \nknowledge products; (ii) conducting (a) IE awareness raising and capacity building for DMC \nofficials involved and/or potentially involved in supported IEs; and (b) workshops and seminars \nwhere global research experts will be invited to share methods, practices, and lessons on IE; and \n(iii) improving and maintaining the current IE data portal to ensure that the products from output \n1 are preserved and put to maximum use. \n \n \n11 Impact evaluation is mainstreamed in ADB operations when it is integrated in the process of designing projects in \nDMCs based on experience from the actual conduct of (i) IEs that adopt appropriate methodologies, (ii) knowledge-\nsharing workshops and conferences, and (iii) capacity building activities. \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 If only the study design or baseline survey can be implemented under the TA, commitment may be required from \nregional departments concerned to undertake mid-line and/or end-line surveys and/or studies. \n ", "4 \n14.  External publications arising from the TA will be disseminated to targeted DMC officials \nand other relevant stakeholder in compliance with the administrative order on environment, \nhealth, and safety management.14 Because the nature of publications will be driven by the \nproposal selection decisions of the impact evaluation committee (IEC), specific target audiences \nand  resulting  demands  for  printed  publications  will  necessarily  be  determined  during  TA \nimplementation. Prior to undertaking any printing, the TA will determine specific target readers, \nestimated  required  numbers  of  copies,  and  associated  printing  and  freight  costs,  while \nrecognizing that printing of external publications is an exceptional arrangement, and that printing \nin excess of demand is to be avoided. Technical reports will be accompanied by other formats \naccessible to less technical audiences, such as policy briefs, as appropriate. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $4,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nTASF-6 and TASF-Others.15 The three intended subprojects under the cluster will have an \nallocation of $1,500,000 each, with subproject 1 to be funded within 2019, followed by the other \nsubprojects in subsequent years. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA, with ERCD responsible for its overall implementation and \nsupervision. Oversight and guidance will be by an IEC,16 which will be a modification of the IEC \nestablished under CTA 0012, comprising representatives (one principal and one alternate)17 from \nADB\u2019s regional departments; ERCD; Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department; \nProcurement,  Portfolio  and  Financial  Management  Department;  and  Strategy,  Policy  and \nPartnerships Department. It will be chaired by the ERCD chief economist and director general \nand cochaired by a member from another department. Other departments will be invited to \ncontribute as observers. For output 1, the IEC will approve all funded studies, while ERCD and \nthe  concerned regional  department  will  be  jointly responsible for conducting the  studies.18 \nRegional departments will propose candidate areas of focus for IE and ensure project and country \nstakeholder support, DMC no-objection or approval, and coordination between the TA and project \nundergoing evaluation. Consultant oversight will be undertaken jointly by ERCD and regional \ndepartments, wherein regional departments will ensure operational relevance, and ERCD will be \navailable, as needed, for ensuring the technical quality of data collection, analysis, and knowledge \nproducts as needed. ERCD will serve as secretariat for the IEC. \n \n17.  To identify well-designed IE studies and allow enough selectivity to maintain regional and \nsector balance, the IEC will call for proposals for IE phases to be funded, with a deadline.19 Each \nsubproject will have a separate request for proposals, under a distinct thematic focus selected by \nthe IEC. ERCD will offer technical support on developing proposals. Limited funds (up to $30,000) \n \n14 TA publications will be disseminated as electronic files by default and in compliance with ADB. 2008. Environment, \nHealth and Safety Management System Administrative Order.AO 4.13 Manila. However, because printed external \npublications remain in demand for selected target readers from DMCs and ADB project staff and management, \nlimited printed copies will be made available. \n15 Use of TASF-6 Funds will be in compliance with the country restrictions for those funds under regional TA. \n16 The structure of the IEC is described in Supplementary Appendix B. \n17 Alternate representatives will also be nominated in case the principal representatives are not available for a meeting. \n18 No-objection will be sought from respective governments of DMCs prior to commencing IE studies. \n19 Each proposal is typically expected not to exceed about $200,000 and the subproject duration. The proposal may \ncover one or multiple data collection rounds, such as baseline (pre-intervention), mid-line (after partial intervention), \nend-line (after full intervention), and/or post-end line (longer after full intervention) surveys and/or analysis. The total \nallocation from the TA cluster for all rounds of a given study should not exceed $500,000. \n ", "5 \nfor diagnostics and proposal preparation may be approved on a rolling basis by the IEC. Each \nsubmitted proposal will include both regional department and ERCD team members, and may \nalso include staff from other departments. IEC members will select new proposals to be supported \naccording to criteria reflecting cost-effectiveness,20 operational relevance, understudied sectors, \ntechnical rigor, feasibility,21 and contribution to knowledge gaps. Gender-differentiated analysis \nwill be encouraged. ERCD will provide technical appraisals to inform IEC funding approval.22 Key \nintermediate IE elements, including inception reports; survey instruments and sampling designs; \nand data cleaning, preparation, and analysis scripts will be submitted to the TA secretariat and \narchived in a data repository system managed by ERCD. \n \n18.  Results of IE studies will be published as reports or as stand-alone working papers, \naccompanied by briefs or other products accessible to nontechnical audiences. ERCD will \npropose, and if approved by the IEC, implement activities that fall under output 2 of the TA in \ncollaboration with regional departments, and other departments as appropriate. \n \n19.  Implementation of the TA cluster and subproject 1 will commence on 20 December 2019 \nwith subprojects 2 and 3 planned for initiation in 2020 and 2021. TA cluster completion is \nscheduled on 20 December 2026, for a total implementation period of just over 6 years. The \nimplementation period exceeds 5 years to enable studies to be supported from beginning to end \nand allow sufficient time to measure longer-term effects when needed. The duration of each \nsubproject is 5 years. Each TA subproject proposal will be submitted for approval to the ERCD \nhead of department, in accordance with the business process for knowledge and support TA \ncluster processing. Subproject activities will start only after approval. \n \n \n \n \n20 Where possible, study proposals that are less costly while meeting the other criteria, will be prioritized.  In addition, \nthe TA encourages proposals for mid-line or end-line surveys, especially where baseline surveys were funded by \nprevious subprojects of the TA. \n21 Feasibility will refer to appraisal of risks to study success, as well as the expected study duration, with preference for \nrapid studies with fewer implementation risks, such as those using \u201cbig data\u201d and other existing datasets. \n22 To avoid conflicts of interest appraisals will be conducted by ERCD staff or consultants that are not members of the \nteam proposing the study. Those involved in preparing and/or implementing specific proposals will also abstain from \nvoting on such proposals. \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  December 2019\u2013December 2026 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency and  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA.

Subprojects. The TA cluster will be implemented through three subprojects (Appendix 2). \nEach subproject will be designed to support the achievement of the cluster outputs (paras. 12\u2013\n13) as and when needed during the implementation period. Each subproject covers at least five \nIE study phases,23 for a total of 15 study phases distributed over ADB\u2019s regional departments. \n \nTable 2: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \nItem  Subproject Title  Implementation Period  Budget  \nSubproject 1  Mainstreaming Impact Evaluation  December 2019\u2013December  $1,500,000 \nMethodologies, Approaches, and Capacities  2024 \nin Selected Developing Member Countries \nSubproject 2  Mainstreaming Impact Evaluation  September 2020\u2013September  $1,500,000 \nMethodologies, Approaches, and Capacities  2025 \nin Selected Developing Member Countries \nSubproject 3  Mainstreaming Impact Evaluation  December 2021\u2013December  $1,500,000 \nMethodologies, Approaches, and Capacities  2026 \nin Selected Developing Member Countries \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n21.  Consulting services. Each of the IE studies will require a team of consultants, both \ninternational and national, to be engaged separately. The consultants will (i) provide technical \nguidance and feedback on the initial IE concept, (ii) develop the design of the IE studies together \nwith the ADB team, (iii) assist in guiding and overseeing the implementation of IE studies, (iv) \nassist in survey and sampling design, (v) implement the surveys, and (vi) assist in data analysis \nand report preparation. In addition, other consultants will need to backstop activities beyond the \nindividual studies (including output 2, as well as overall support to output 1), by supporting \noutreach, helping to monitor and improve IE efforts by the study teams, ensuring that ADB \nknowledge products are generated from studies, preparing synthesis reports, and contributing to \ncapacity building. \n \n \n23 A \u201cphase\u201d refers to a survey round, such as a baseline or end-line survey. Most IEs are based on two survey rounds. \n ", "7 \n22.  Consequently, the TA cluster will require the services of a mix of individual consultants \nand firms. Support beyond individual IE studies by international IE experts and editors and \nnational research associates, project coordinators, and layout artists will be through individual \nconsulting services. The precise composition of firms and individual consultants for IE studies \nfunded under output 1 will depend on the proposals approved by the IEC. Some studies may \ncontract  specific  roles  through  individual  consultant  selection  or  framework  agreements, \nsupplemented by nonconsulting services for data. Others may be contracted through firms via \nselection methods determined based on the resource needs of the IE studies. Purchase of goods, \ndata, and information technology equipment within consulting contracts will be allowed if justified \nto be cost-effective and approved by ADB. Subject to approval of the ADB\u2019s Procurement, \nPortfolio, and Financial Management Department, single-source selection will be used when the \nproposed engagement is a continuation of previously initiated work and/or there is only one firm \nwith capacity to deliver the proposed IE tasks. The consultants will be engaged in accordance \nwith the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated \nProject Administration Instructions and/or Staff Instructions.  \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s procurement. Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time), the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time); and Staff Instructions for TA Procurement of Goods, Works and Nonconsulting \nServices. Nonconsulting services for separately contracted data collection will be procured using \nopen  advertisement  or request  for  quotation. Procurement  of  equipment  will  take  place  in \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  Office  of \nAdministrative Services. When the TA is completed, any procured equipment will remain ADB \nproperty and/or will be disposed of in accordance with relevant ADB guidelines. Disbursements \nunder the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nV.

The third pathway is often the \nmost important over the long term, but is also difficult to track or predict in the short term, so it has no direct target. \nc  Based on (i) five key sets of reporting per funded study (inception report, sampling plan, questionnaire, raw data, \nand data analysis with preparation scripts); (ii) study reports/papers; (iii) twice-yearly updates on each study; (iv) \nquarterly financial updates; (v) workshops; and (vi) synthesis reports. Updates are considered timely if they occur \nwhen details are available, or at the regular reporting frequency. \nd  Fund source of $1,250,000 is from TASF-6 and $250,000 from TASF-Others.

The TA will \nstrategically support IEs, ensure that previously initiated IEs are \nsuccessfully completed, and encourage low-cost approaches, especially on \nunderstudied themes. New studies will be supported under a theme to be \ndefined by the impact evaluation committee (IEC). The TA may also \nsupport key phases of individual studies, with other phases financed \nindependently. The TA will also support collaboration with leading research \npartners on rigorous IE analysis and publish high-quality ADB reports and \nresearch papers. It may also allocate small funding amounts for diagnostic \nwork to scope promising IE possibilities and prepare proposals.  \nKey activities will include: \n(i)  screening and selection of IE proposals, \n(ii)  engagement of consultants, \n(iii) preparation of inception reports, \n(iv) conduct of IEs, and \n(v)  publication of IEs and dissemination of reports. \n \nOutput 2 will enhance IE awareness and capacity among ADB DMCs.
