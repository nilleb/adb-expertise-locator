INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2015 country program mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) \nto the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) for Strategies for Involving Social Organizations in Social \nAssistance.  ADB  included  the  proposed  policy  and  advisory  TA  in  its  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018 for the PRC.1 ADB approved the TA concept paper on 29 April 2016. \nOn 5 May 2016, ADB conducted a fact-finding mission and reached an agreement with the \ngovernment on the impact, outcome, outputs, terms of reference for consultants, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC is now an upper-middle-income country. After years of reducing widespread \nrural poverty, the government is now focusing on the remaining concentrations of persistent \npoverty and on the quality and reach of its social assistance to vulnerable households.3 The \nPRC has also introduced a reform agenda to redefine the role of government in relation to \nsociety and the market.4 In the social sector, this agenda includes creating a service-oriented \ngovernment  that  is  focused  more  on  funding,  regulating,  and  evaluating  social  assistance \nactivities and less on managing and controlling each stage of delivery and assessment of these \nactivities.  The  reform  agenda  is  also  intended  to  create  more  opportunities  to  involve \nnongovernmental entities, such as social organizations,5 in delivering social assistance. \n \n3.  The new, increasingly diverse, and often gendered social needs that have arisen from \nrapid  urbanization,  population  migration,  an  aging  population,  evolving  family  structures, \ngeographically  unequal  growth,  and  economic  rebalancing  are  driving  the  need  for  social \norganizations to be more engaged in social assistance. New increasingly individualized needs \nof the poor and vulnerable now include household- and community-based care for elders and \nchildren (including family members left behind in rural areas), the provision of counseling and \ninformation, community-based mental health care and disability management, and a range of \nmeans-tested  social  assistance  investigations,  incentive  arrangements,  and  third-party \nverification. As traditional support networks attenuate or break, earlier models of government \nassistance\u2014through  the  provision  of  basic  welfare  goods  (such  as  clothing,  food,  and \nbedding)\u2014and cash transfers are becoming insufficient. To access, use, and benefit from social \nassistance,  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  populations  need  new  sources  of  services, \ninformation, and facilitation. The scope of social assistance is also expanding. For instance, the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 May 2016. \n3  MOCA\u2019s social assistance includes the Minimum Livelihood Guarantee System (dibao); Support for the Destitute; \nand some forms of medical, educational, housing, employment, and temporary assistance. Some schemes are \nhuge, with urban dibao assisting 18.77 million people and rural dibao 52 million as of 2014. \n4  People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2016. Opinions of the State Council on Further Improving the System of \nAssistance and Support for People in Extreme Poverty. Beijing. This publication notes that \u201csenior citizens, \nphysically challenged people who cannot support themselves, and minors under the age of 16 but without \nsupervisors, or with supervisors who cannot support them, are eligible for relief and support from the government. \nGovernment should provide basic support for daily necessities for these groups and basic care services for those \nwho cannot take care of themselves.\u201d \n5  Social organizations are defined as \u201cnot-for-profit organizations that are formed voluntarily by Chinese citizens in \norder to realize the shared objectives of their members, carrying out activities in accordance with their charter.\u201d \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 1998. Regulations on the Registration and Administration of Social \nOrganizations. Beijing. These organizations include professional associations, urban and rural social service \norganizations, and chambers of commerce. \n ", "2  \nNovember 2015 decisions of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State \nCouncil  on  Winning  the  Tough  Battle  against  Poverty  outline  processes  for  rural  poverty \nreduction to 2020. It proposed making greater use of social assistance to support extremely \npoor rural residents, particularly through the minimum subsistence allowance (dibao) system \nand the temporary social assistance system. Service quality for both of these MOCA schemes \nwill also be strengthened. Social expectations have also been rising along with changing social \nstructures and needs. As a result, social satisfaction, stability, and inclusion have become \nimportant  elements  for  social  assistance  and  for  broader  economic  development  efforts, \nparticularly as the PRC rebalances economically to meet new environmental objectives. These \nchanges make it essential to improve the targeting, quality, and evaluation of social assistance. \n \n4.  The Government of the PRC has begun to recognize the increasing capacity of social \norganizations to help meet social assistance needs. In particular, outsourcing social assistance \nto social organizations can improve service quality, strengthen outreach to underserved groups, \nfill service gaps, enhance innovation, and increase client satisfaction. Under the right conditions, \noutsourcing can also foster partnerships between the government and social organizations by \ntaking advantage of each partner\u2019s strengths. For example, the government is generally well \nsuited to overall program administration, coverage of large areas, and the provision of cash \ntransfers; however, its delivery of local, targeted social assistance is often weak or absent. By \ncomparison,  social  organizations  are  particularly  adept  at  customized,  micro-level  service \nprovision and improvements\u2014in some cases because members of social organizations belong \nto, or have a deep understanding of and acceptance from, the vulnerable populations they \nserve.6 Social  organizations  assign  high  priority  to  client  identification  of  problems  and \nownership of responses, and are thus in an ideal position to complement the government\u2019s \ncash-based welfare programs through noncash services and support. Such efforts may include \nthe creative pooling of resources to efficiently deliver multiple services and improve service \nquality. Some social organizations attract additional funding and human resources through \ndonations and volunteering, bringing more resources into the sector and helping to use them \nmore effectively. These characteristics help strengthen the sustainability of social assistance \nand increase client satisfaction.7 \n \n5.  The  government  has  initiated  a  process  to  develop  legislative  and  operational \nmechanisms for subnational levels of MOCA\u2014which are civil affairs agencies at provincial, \nethnic autonomous region, city, district or county levels\u2014to contract social assistance delivery \nto social organizations. The process began in 2013, with the State Council Guiding Opinions on \nGovernment Purchase of Social Services\u2014which was followed in 2014 by the State Council \nTemporary Measures for Social Assistance. These documents recognize the role of social \norganizations in providing quality services, generating and managing donations, recruiting and \norganizing the work of volunteers, and managing other aspects of social service provision. \nHowever, neither is specific enough for effective local implementation. \n \n6.  Moreover, social organizations have been rather slow to engage in contracted social \nassistance delivery. Among the reasons are (i) information asymmetry on opportunities and \nexpectations and the resulting lack of mutual understanding between local civil affairs agencies \nand social organizations; (ii) limited program scope that limits social organization opportunities \nfor  innovation;  (iii)  rigid  procurement  requirements  (e.g.,  qualifications,  funding  limits,  and \n                                                \n6  M. Jagusztyn. 2014. Scaling Up Social Service Outsourcing in China: An Exploratory Study of HIV CSOs in \nYunnan. China Development Brief. 14 January.  \n7   ADB. 2009. Final Report on Government Procurement of Public Services in the People\u2032s Republic of China. Manila \n(TA 4790-PRC). \n \n ", "  3\nproject duration); and (iv) social organizations\u2019 inability to make use of the financial subsidies \nand other incentives that were intended to encourage contracting. Some initial pilots have been \ncarried out by subnational levels of MOCA, but the findings have not been synthesized by \nnational MOCA staff to inform policy improvement. Recommendations for strengthening the \ncapacity  of  MOCA  and  social  organizations  to  undertake  service  contracting  are  urgently \nneeded. In particular, it is important to research, identify, and pilot specific mechanisms for \neffective contracting of MOCA subnational-level social assistance to social organizations. Such \nefforts would focus on the content of contracting arrangements, funding sources, assessment, \nevaluation, supervision, and administration. The litmus test for social assistance reform is the \nquality  of  governance,  implementation,  effectiveness,  and  inclusiveness.  Clearly,  the \ndevelopment  of  a  stronger  enabling  environment\u2014including  specific  local  processes  for \ncontracting social organizations to deliver MOCA social assistance\u2014is critical. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impacts  will  be  a  specific,  market-oriented  procurement  method  and  improved \nMOCA subnational-level contracting of social assistance delivery from social organizations. The \noutcome will be a stronger enabling environment and local processes for MOCA contracting of \nsocial assistance delivery to social organizations. The impact and outcome will be evident from \n(i)  the  adoption  of  new,  national-level  administrative  guidance  for  contracting  social \norganizations for social assistance delivery; and (ii) MOCA\u2019s use of contracting strategies, \nguidelines, indicators, and gender-sensitive case studies to train selected MOCA national and \nsubnational-level staff from pilot locations. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will conduct policy analysis; multi-province surveys;8 in-depth field interviews; \ndata collection; an international training study tour to ADB member countries; and substantial \nconsultations  with  PRC  and  international  social  organizations,  MOCA  social  assistance \nagencies at all levels, and specialists to achieve four outputs: (i) the creation of timely interim \nand final policy recommendations for improving MOCA subnational-level contracting of social \nassistance from social organizations; (ii) the creation of contracting strategies, guidelines, and \nindicators; (iii) the creation of gender-sensitive case studies; and (iv) the creation and sharing of \nknowledge products and findings. \n \n9.  Output 1: Provision of timely interim and final policy recommendations. The TA will \nassist MOCA to strengthen the enabling environment for contracting social organizations to \ndeliver social assistance. This will entail reviewing national and international policies, practices, \nand experiences; and preparing policy-level recommendations. Research and recommendations \nwill  take  the  form  of  bilingual,  peer-reviewed  reports  and  policy  brief(s),  including  a  TA \ncompletion  report  and  four  subreports  on  (i)  international  and  regional  good  practices;  (ii) \nnational experiences; (iii) contracting strategies, guidelines, and indicators; and (iv) case studies. \n \n10.  Output 2: Development of strategies, guidelines, and indicators. The TA will assist \nMOCA to develop contracting strategies, guidelines, and indicators and to outline the necessary \nprocedures, skills, and resources required. This will entail (i) conducting surveys and interviews \n                                                \n8  The provinces proposed initially by the Ministry of Civil Affairs were Guangdong (eastern PRC), Anhui (central \nPRC), and Sichuan (western PRC); both Anhui and Sichuan are located within the Yangtze River Economic Belt. \n ", "4  \nin western, central, and eastern PRC; (ii) conducting workshops and discussion groups on \ncontracting  strategies,  guidelines,  and  indicators;  (iii)  preparing  a  contracting  strategies, \nguidelines,  and  indicators  subreport  for  the  completion  report  and  policy  brief(s);  and  (iv) \nensuring that selected MOCA national and subnational level-staff are trained on the contracting \nstrategies, guidelines, and indicators and are capable of training other MOCA subnational staff. \n \n11.  Output 3: Production of gender-sensitive case studies. The TA will assist MOCA to \nassess the (i) status and needs of the MOCA system at national and subnational levels and (ii) \ninterest  and  capacity  of  social  organizations  to  provide  contracted  delivery  of  MOCA \nsubnational-level social assistance. This will entail analyzing and documenting pilot and nonpilot \nexperiences to create gender-sensitive case studies of the skills, contracted activity content, \ndelivery channels, and benefits that social organizations can contribute; and the constraints and \nconcerns  that  can  affect  the  engagement  of  stakeholders,  such  as  different  levels  of \ngovernment, institutions, social organizations, communities, and households. Findings will be \nincluded in a case study subreport and at least 16 case studies for use in training and/or \nteaching.  \n \n12.  Output 4: Creation and sharing of knowledge products and findings. The TA will \nassist  MOCA  to  document  national  and  international  contracting  experiences  in  social \nassistance delivery by social organizations through case studies, synthesis of pilot experience, \nguidelines  and  indicators,  policy  brief(s),  outputs  from  the  training  study  tour,  and  other \nreporting. These materials will be disseminated according to the TA knowledge-dissemination \nplan and used in a trial train-the-trainers program for selected MOCA staff from at least six \nprovinces. MOCA will publish at least two journal articles on the training study tour findings. \n \n13.  The key risks to achieving the expected outputs and outcome are as follows: (i) reform \nchanges may occur faster than planned and make TA recommendations less relevant, and (ii) \nthe priority (and associated funding) that the national government has assigned to contracted \nsocial assistance may  not  be  sustained. The TA will attempt  to  reduce  these risks  by (i) \nmonitoring government policy agendas and the related policy environment and time frames; (ii) \ndisseminating  interim  findings  to  key  stakeholders,  including  social  organizations;  and  (iii) \norganizing quarterly coordination meetings with the MOCA national-level departments for social \nassistance and international cooperation. These two departments also oversee and advise on \nsocial assistance and international cooperation work performed by subnational levels of MOCA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space and supplies, data and \ninformation,  travel  costs  and  per  diem for MOCA  counterpart  staff  and  national  and  local \ngovernment officials to visit study sites, and other in kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOCA will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented from 1 August 2016 to \n31 May 2018. \n \n16.  In  consultation  with  MOCA,  ADB  will  recruit  individual  national  and  international \nconsultants to serve as short-term resources. The TA will engage the consultants in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and will \n ", "  5\nfinalize the terms of reference for resource persons, including duration and expected results. \nProceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will require 31 person-\nmonths of individual consulting services from three national and two international consultants.  \n \n17.  A national expert on government procurement of social assistance will act as team \nleader and assume overall responsibility for writing and disseminating reports; organizing the \nsurvey design and implementation, the fieldwork plan, project meetings, and international and \nnational  workshops,  including  training  on  contracting  strategies,  guidelines,  and  indicators; \ncompleting the policy brief(s) and TA completion report, including the subreport on national and \npilot contracting experiences; and contributing to the development of a contracting strategies, \nguidelines,  and  indicators  subreport  (10  person-months).  A  national  expert  on  PRC  social \norganizations will work with team members; conduct field visits, interviews, and focus groups to \ndevelop the case study subreport and to trial case study use in teaching and or training; and \nsupport training, the conduct of meetings, and the dissemination of the TA (8 person-months). \nAn international expert on social sector institutions and governance will review international \nsocial organization contracting practices and document the findings in a subreport; coordinate \nthe international training study tour, including reviewing pre- and post-tour documentation; and \nassist in the development of a contracting strategies, guidelines, and indicators subreport and \nthe  dissemination  of  the  TA  findings  and  knowledge  products  (4  person-months).  An \ninternational  expert  on  contracting  for  social  assistance  will  review  good  national  and \ninternational practices and case studies; conduct meetings and interviews; and take prime \nresponsibility  for  developing  and  documenting  the  contracting  strategies,  guidelines,  and \nindicators and associated subreport (4 person-months). A national administrative and financial \nassistant will assist with logistics, including administering fieldwork, meetings, and dissemination \nplanning (5 person-months). An international training study tour will be provided by a reputable \ntraining institution with which ADB will enter into a service agreement. \n \n18.  The TA will have project-specific indicators and targets, including timely implementation, \nprogress  reporting,  and  periodic  deliverables.  ADB  and  the  MOCA  departments  of  social \nassistance and international cooperation will hold quarterly coordination meetings to assess and \ndocument  overall  progress  and  ensure  timely  outputs  and  effective  dissemination.  The \nconsultant team leader and MOCA and ADB focal points will engage in a self-evaluation at the \nconcluding quarterly coordination meeting. \n \n19.  Good practices and lessons learned will be widely disseminated through stakeholder \nmeetings;  a  bilingual  TA  completion report,  subreports,  and  policy  brief(s);  guidelines  and \nindicators; case studies; a training study tour report; and MOCA journal articles. In particular, \nthe MOCA TA focal point will provide MOCA leadership with interim findings, the TA completion \nreport, policy brief(s), and MOCA journal articles for consideration in developing new policy and \nlegislation. MOCA will provide printed TA guidelines to its provincial departments of civil affairs \nand will offer incentives for voluntary adoption. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China for Strategies  for  Involving Social  Organizations  in  Social \nAssistance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nContracted delivery of MOCA social assistance by social organizations improved.
