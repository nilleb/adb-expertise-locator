The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  active  in  promoting  clean  energy \ninitiatives1 to  minimize  adverse  local,  regional,  and  global  impacts.  To  this  end,  ADB  has \ninitiated the clean energy and environment program (CEEP) to increase the number of clean \nenergy projects in the Asia and Pacific region. One of the key components of the CEEP is the \ncarbon market initiative (CMI), which will provide technical support and up-front financing for \nclean energy projects with greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation benefits.  \n \n2.  The CMI is a value-added service extended to renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects in Asia and the Pacific that are suitable for ADB financing. It contributes to ADB\u2019s \nefforts in the field of sustainable development by providing additional financial incentives to \nproject developers and sponsors to construct and operate clean energy projects. The CMI is a \ntool-based approach that harnesses the carbon market to catalyze investment in clean energy \nprojects. The CMI has three components: (i) a project cofinancing facility (the Asia Pacific \nCarbon Fund) that provides up-front financing against the purchase of future certified emission \nreductions (CERs) generated by eligible projects, (ii) a carbon credit marketing facility for project \ndevelopers and sponsors to obtain the best available market price for carbon credits, and (iii) \ntechnical support for project preparation and implementation.  \n \n3.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA),  which  will  contribute  directly  to  the  third \ncomponent of the CMI, is needed to undertake preparatory due diligence work, carbon credit \nvaluation,  and  documentation  preparation.  These  activities  will  facilitate  the  validation  and \nregistration of projects within ADB\u2019s 2007\u20132008 work program which may obtain additional \nbenefits through use of the clean development mechanism (CDM)2 under the Kyoto Protocol. \nConcept clearance for this TA was obtained on 11 August 2006.3The TA is expected to build the \ncapacities of project developers in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) and to help \nADB operational departments conceptualize and prepare clean energy CDM-eligible projects for \nADB financing.  \n \nII.    ISSUES \n \n4.  Access  to  energy  is  essential  to  ensure  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. In response to expected high rates of economic growth, the demand for energy in \nAsia  and  the  Pacific  is  projected  to  increase  significantly  in  the  next  30  years.  However, \ncontinued reliance on fossil fuels as the dominant sources of energy will have adverse impacts \non the environment. The increasing level of GHGs in the atmosphere is becoming a significant \ninternational challenge, causing global warming and resultant climate change. A shift toward \ncleaner energy sources and a low-carbon global economy is essential to ensure sustainable \ngrowth and environmental integrity. ADB\u2019s energy policy4 includes a recommendation to reorient \nenergy sector activities to address regional and global environmental concerns. Therefore the \nnext  logical  step  for  ADB  is  to  help  its  DMCs  mobilize  additional  resources  for  energy \ndevelopment projects that mitigate GHG emissions.      \n \n                                                 \n1  Clean energy initiatives include energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies and policies. \n2  The CDM is one of three flexible market mechanisms established under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. The CDM is relevant to ADB operations, as it is a way to encourage \ninvestment in GHG reduction projects in developing countries, including ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n3   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 August 2006. \n4  ADB. 2000. Energy 2000 Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila.  \n ", "2   \n5.  The carbon market was created to facilitate investments in clean energy. Buyers of \ncarbon credits are expected to provide additional financing for such investments and boost the \nfinancial  viability  of  alternative,  cleaner  energy  sources  that  are  locally  available  and  will \ngenerate long-term GHG reduction benefits. Despite the possibilities, however, most buyers and \ninvestors  under  existing  carbon  procurement  facilities  only  provide  funding  upon  project \ncompletion, when the carbon credits are delivered. As a result, many clean energy projects \nnever reach the construction phase because of funding shortages, as well as a lack of technical \ncapacity.  The  CMI  is  intended  to  address  the  up-front  funding  shortages  and  technical \nknowledge gaps.   \n \n6.  The CDM can promote sustainable development in ADB\u2019s DMCs by accelerating the \npenetration of clean energy projects and the conservation of natural resources in developing \ncountries while helping industrial countries meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. \nSuch  activities  yield  both  local  and  global  environmental  benefits,  and  the  CDM  ensures \nadditional  benefits  to  those  project  developers  that  opt  for  cleaner  projects  and  activities. \nSubstantial synergies exist between ADB\u2019s objectives of promoting sustainable growth and \nclean energy projects and the CDM\u2019s objectives. However, the CDM is a complex process and \nmost DMCs are still not fully equipped to harness its benefits in a competitive way. Given these \ncircumstances, ADB can play a critical role in helping DMCs harness the potential of the CDM.   \n \n7.  On 29 July 2005, ADB launched the energy efficiency initiative to expand its investments \nin energy efficiency projects (which encompass energy supply, including renewable energy and \nend-use efficiency) to at least $1 billion a year starting in 2008. The energy efficiency initiative \nwill pursue energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that can also qualify under the \nCDM to generate CER credits. Similarly, the multitranche financing facility approved on 25 \nAugust 2005 under the innovation and efficiency initiative enhances ADB\u2019s assistance to DMCs \nin the area of clean energy by streamlining the financing of subprojects over multiple years. The \nproposed TA will maximize the synergy between these initiatives, namely, the CMI, the energy \nefficiency initiative, and the innovation and efficiency initiative, to enhance the development \neffectiveness of ADB\u2019s CEEP.    \n   \n8.  ADB has a portfolio of projects that could yield a significant quantity of CER credits. A \npreliminary review of ADB\u2019s pipeline of projects for the next 3 years reveals that more than 80 \nprojects across various operations departments have or could incorporate components eligible \nfor the CDM. The scope of these projects has yet to be fully developed, but initial analysis \nsuggests that they could reduce GHG emissions by as much as 12 million to 18 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2012. Use of the CDM can translate into multiple benefits \nfor DMCs through an enhanced revenue stream and a greater number of clean energy projects. \nADB staff in the operations departments need to be assisted to screen projects for their CDM \npotential and to provide assistance to DMCs for further actions in this regard.  \n \n9.  The TA forms the initial stage of the development of a technical support facility and is \ndesigned to help ADB\u2019s operations departments assess the concepts, emissions baselines, \nfinancial viability, additionality, and technical soundness of eligible ADB-supported projects. \nAdequate  training  and  country  consultations  must  also  take  place  to  ensure  a  continuous \npipeline of candidate projects. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The goal of the TA is to increase the number of clean energy projects with GHG \nabatement benefits across Asia and the Pacific. The TA is expected to build the pipeline of \nclean energy projects eligible for the CDM and to enhance the technical knowledge of project \ndevelopers and sponsors in the DMCs in relation to conceptualizing and preparing such projects \nfor possible ADB financing. The detailed design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  ADB will carry out the work under the TA through a consultative process with the \noperations departments.  The TA activities will include the following: \n(i)  Project identification. Help the operations departments undertake a preliminary \nassessment of projects and identify projects with GHG abatement potential. The \nTA will also provide technical inputs into country consultation missions to identify \nclean energy projects potentially eligible for the CDM and their inclusion in the \ncountry partnership strategies.  \n(ii)  Project development. Assist in conducting preliminary screening of projects\u2019 \nCDM potential to assess projects\u2019 eligibility under CDM rules, conducting due \ndiligence  on  clean  energy  projects  potentially  eligible  for  the  CDM,  and \nsupporting project developers and sponsors in drafting project design documents \nand new baseline and monitoring methodologies if required. \n(iii)  Validation  and  registration.  Help  project  developers  obtain  host  country \napprovals  and  validation  of  project  design  documents  from  the  designated \noperational entity5 and have them registered with the CDM Executive Board. \n(iv)  Capacity development. Help assess the capacities of DMC governments and \nagencies to develop CDM-eligible clean energy projects and conduct targeted \nCDM technical workshops for countries and regions with project opportunities in \nthe near term to midterm.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $840,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. It will support TA \nconsultants and ADB resource staff participate in country programming and project missions, \nequipment costs, training, seminars and workshops, publications and information services, CDM \nvalidation costs, fees and remuneration for international and national consultants and technical \nexperts, and miscellaneous administration and support costs. The detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA. ADB will implement the TA through the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department\u2019s Energy, Transport, and Water Division in \nclose collaboration with the operations departments. The Energy, Transport, and Water Division \nwill also work closely with other relevant departments and offices, such as the Office of the \n                                                 \n5  Third party certification organizations accredited by the CDM Executive Board to review and validate the project \ndocuments.  \n ", "4   \nGeneral Counsel and the Office of Cofinancing Operations. ADB will also coordinate closely \nwith other international financial institutions and financing partners. To date, no specific DMC \nhas been identified in whose territory any specific activity of the RETA will be undertaken; \nhowever, any activity funded by this RETA will only commence in a particular DMC after ADB \nhas received a no-objection in writing from the government of the DMC.  \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented from January 2007 to April 2008. The following outputs are \nexpected:  (i)  the  development  of  clean  energy  project  concepts  for  inclusion  in  country \npartnership strategies, (ii) the identification and preparation of projects potentially eligible for the \nCDM in the near term to midterm in consultation with DMC partners and ADB\u2019s operational \ndepartments, (iii) the preparation of project design documents and new baseline methodologies, \nand (iv) the successful CDM validation of projects. \n \n15.  Implementation will involve national expert consultants from DMCs to support DMC \ngovernments  and  ADB  operations  departments  as  necessary;  international  technical \nconsultants based at ADB headquarters to provide central support; and ADB specialist staff to \nliaise with ADB operations departments as well as with those involved in other initiatives under \nthe CEEP. National consultants within identified DMCs will be engaged for a total of 50 person-\nmonths. International consultants will be engaged for 21 person-months. Short-term consultants \nand resource persons will be recruited to fill skills gaps as needed. Appendix 3 presents the \noutline terms of reference for consultants. All consultants will be recruited as individuals and in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n16.  Equipment and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.
