INTRODUCTION \n1.  Viet  Nam  has  achieved  rapid  economic  growth  over  the  past  two  decades  but \nmomentum is slowing, requiring that reform efforts deepen and accelerate. Within this context, \ngovernment  objectives  include  strengthening  finance  sector  supervision  and  developing  a \ndeeper and more diversified domestic finance system capable of mobilizing funds for investment, \nincluding for critical infrastructure. The government\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Strategy, \n2011\u20132020 identifies economic restructuring of the finance sector as a key to the country\u2019s long-\nterm development. The country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 of Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for Viet Nam supports the development strategy and prioritizes deepening of the finance \nsector to mobilize the private capital needed to improve infrastructure and to ensure the delivery \nof utilities and social services.1 This TA, which has been requested by the government, will \nsupport  this  shared  reform  agenda  for  financial  sector  development  and  continue  reforms \ninitiated under the Financial Sector Deepening Program, including policy actions for subprogram \n2.2 The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.3 The TA has been \ndiscussed with the government.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB has been supporting finance sector development in Viet Nam since 1993. An initial \nTA project to develop rural finance was followed by three successive sector program loans.6 \nThese policy-based loans, which utilized a programmatic approach, supported finance sector \ndevelopment through a wide range of reforms including preparation of a basic legal framework, \nincreased competition, enhanced information dissemination, improved trading infrastructure, \nstronger  supervision,  and  new  solvency  ratios  for  credit  institutions.  The  Public  Debt \nManagement Office and the Anti-Money Laundering Information Center were established. Most \nrecently, the Financial Sector Deepening Program is providing an enabling environment to \nsupport the development of a short-term money market, strengthen the legal and operating \nframework for public debt, and enhance investor protection. The State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) \nand  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  completed  human  resource  development  plans,  and \naccounting  and  auditing  standards  were  strengthened  to  establish  the  groundwork  for  the \neventual adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \n \n3.  This collaboration has contributed to the establishment of a nascent but fast growing \nfinance sector. A basic money market has taken root and  several short-term interest rate \nbenchmarks have been identified. The local bond market, while small, is currently growing at the \nfastest rate in emerging East Asia on both a quarter-on-quarter (fourth quarter of 2013 and first \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n4  Draft TA papers were circulated within the government and discussed during the July 2014 fact finding mission and \nSeptember 2014 reconnaissance mission. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 December  2014. \n6  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nquarter of 2014), and year-on-year basis (first quarter of 2014). This performance reflects \ncontinuing government efforts to build a deeper, more efficient government bond market by \nestablishing a primary dealer system, identifying benchmark securities, and developing a yield \ncurve. The number of outstanding issues of government debt has declined and auctions now \nregularly include 10- and 15-year tenors. Combined stock market capitalization increased to \n23%  of  gross  domestic  product  by  the  end  of  2012,  from  zero  in  2002;  and  insurance \npenetration rates at 1.4% of gross domestic product are comparable to those of Indonesia and \nthe Philippines. These initiatives, along with political and economic reforms initiated in 1986, \nhelped the country achieve a lower middle-income status and reach a per capita income of \n$1,755 in 2013. As a result, the population living in absolute poverty, defined as less than $1.25 \na day, fell sharply to 17% in 2008 from 64% in 1993. \n \n4.  However,  to  achieve  higher  middle-income  status,  and  to  meet  the  goals  of  the \nsocioeconomic development strategy, more needs to be done to further develop the finance \nsector  and  increase  its  intermediation. While  large relative  to  gross domestic  product, the \nbanking system\u2019s intermediation is constrained by its weak balance sheet. Nonperforming loans \nhave proliferated due to rapid lending growth through the 2008 global financial crisis followed by \na stagnating economy, a downturn in the property market, and poor performance of some highly \nleveraged state-owned enterprises. Concerns regarding counter-party credit risk are pervasive. \nThe recently published Financial Sector Assessment Program report suggests a nonperforming \nloan ratio of 12%, well in excess of the 6.0% estimated by SBV in February 2013.7  \n \n5.  Progress in developing a money market has been slowed by the government\u2019s need to \nrestrain the inappropriate use of short-term lending. Sector wide corrective action, rather than \nbank specific, has reduced interbank lending volumes. Tenors have shortened to less than 3 \nmonths, and the number of active participants has segmented and declined. Along with excess \nliquidity, the market identifies primary constraints as (i) restrictive regulations arising out of the \nadoption  of  Circular  21,  (ii)  lack  of  confidence,  and  (iii)  heightened  credit  risk  concerns. \nStandardized agreements, such as for repurchase transactions, have not been developed and \nreal-time granular statistics of money market activity are not publicly available. The Viet Nam \ninterbank-offered rate, which serves as a short-term benchmark, is seen as indicative; market \nparticipants do not accept the measure as reflective of actual market conditions.  \n \n6.  Despite recent growth, the local currency government bond market remains small and is \nunderdeveloped and illiquid. Viet Nam exhibits the widest bid\u2013ask spreads in emerging East \nAsia along with low transaction sizes and counts. The market lacks the risk management tools \nand  skills  necessary  to  improve  the  primary  issuance  process  and  encourage  secondary \ntrading. The settlement of government securities transactions carries elevated and unique risks \nas the cash leg of the transaction is routed through the state-owned Bank for Investment and \nDevelopment. Likewise, the centralized Viet Nam Securities Depository functions largely as a \ncentral  clearing  counterparty  (CCP),  but  without  the  necessary  capital  base  and  risk \nmanagement systems. Viet Nam has not yet adopted IFRS. Vietnamese Accounting Standards, \nwhich are anchored in historical cost, hamper price discovery and provide no incentive to \nimprove risk management.  \n \n7.  To  enable  the  further  development  of  the  financial  markets,  the  government  must \nprovide absolute priority to addressing the large backlog of nonperforming debt that acts as a \ndrag on the entire finance sector. ADB is providing active support to restructure state-owned \nenterprises  to  increase  efficiency  and  achieve  profitability.  In  the  banking  system,  SBV\u2019s \n                                                \n7  World Bank and International Monetary Fund. 2014. Financial Sector Assessment\u2013Vietnam. Washington, DC. \n ", "  3 \ncreation of the Viet Nam Asset Management Company (VAMC) represents a positive step. \nHowever, weaknesses within VAMC and the regulatory framework impair the organization\u2019s \nability to aggressively resolve problem borrowers. Pending  completion of an ongoing legal \nreview, concurrent initiatives must be launched to ensure VAMC has the technical capacity to \nadminister  problematic  borrowers.8 At  the  same  time,  transparency  must  be  strengthened \nthrough the progressive adoption of IFRS, including the concept of market value. Accurate \nvaluation of collateral is essential to encourage widespread participation in the government\u2019s \nefforts to address the large overhang of problem assets. \n \n8.  While  recognizing  the  government\u2019s  concerns,  increased  transaction  volume  in  the \nmoney market must still be encouraged. Reliable short-term benchmark interest rates must be \nestablished to support price discovery and enhanced risk management.9 The legal framework \nmust  be  revised  and  real-time,  granular  information  must  then  be  collected,  collated,  and \npublished. Heightened counterparty credit risk must be mitigated through the introduction of \nstandardized agreements for repurchase transactions, and related disincentives such as risk \nprovisioning for interbank lending must be rationalized. In addition, the government\u2019s continuing \nefforts to develop the government bond market must now be supported by concurrent efforts to \nmodernize  the  payment  system  and  reduce  risk  in  the  government  securities  settlement \nprocess. Upgrades to the payment system, including an assurance of close-out netting and the \neventual development of a CCP, will do much to strengthen investor confidence and increase \nparticipation in financial markets. Finally, a sequenced introduction of basic derivatives along \nwith the planned incorporation of market value in VAS will establish the groundwork for more \nrobust risk management techniques and strategies. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will begin to address the large overhang of problem assets by initiating an \nimprovement  in  VAMC\u2019s  ability  to  execute  problem  debt resolution strategies. The TA  will \nincrease transparency, improve the reliability of financial reporting, and encourage the adoption \nof risk management. Technical advice will be provided to support development of the money \nmarket and a reliable short-term benchmark interest rate. Finally, the TA will increase investor \nconfidence by reducing systemic risk in the clearing and settlement process, and by setting the \nstage for the introduction of hedging instruments. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be strengthened financial market infrastructure. The outcome will be the \nidentification and initiation of priority upgrades to finance market infrastructure.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Supervision and resolution framework improved. The TA will support a \ndiagnostic to assess VAMC\u2019s structure, organization, operating processes, and staffing relative \nto international standards and norms. Recommendations to enhance resolution strategies will \nmirror effective strategies adopted within the region. The TA will support MOF\u2019s ongoing efforts \n                                                \n8  The Japan International Cooperation Agency is performing a diagnostic on the bankruptcy and secured lending \nframework. \n9  Well-functioning money markets represent a fundamental building block of financial market development and \nenable (i) financial institutions to match short-term assets and liabilities, (ii) securities dealers to finance their \ninventories and make two-way markets, (iii) corporations to smooth out working capital needs, (iv) central banks to \nconduct predictable and effective monetary policy, and (v) the market to price financial instruments. \n ", "4   \nto  introduce  IFRS  by  providing  technical  advice  and  establishing  an engagement  with  the \nInternational  Accounting  Standards  Board.  The  component  is  conceived  as  a  catalyst  to \nencourage the eventual commercial translation of IFRS into Vietnamese by increasing demand \nfor the service. It will fund subscriptions to commercial English translations of IFRS to facilitate \ndrafting of enabling legislation, regulations, and local accounting standards; and a licensing \nagreement so that subsequent publications of the Viet Nam Accounting Standards can be \nclosely modeled on IFRS.  \n \n12.  Output  2:  Money  market  development  encouraged.  The  TA  will  support  recent \ncollaborative efforts between SBV and MOF to prioritize development of a short-term money \nmarket. It  will  provide  an  enabling  environment to  encourage  higher  volumes  of  interbank \nlending, and technical advice to establish a more reliable short-term benchmark interest rate. \nTechnical advice covering the legal framework, standards and documentation, market practices, \nand  data  collection  and  dissemination  will  be  provided.  Fixed  sums  will  be  dedicated  to \ncontinuing the development of a repurchase market and to supporting stakeholder education \nthrough a partnership between ADB and the International Capital Markets Association. The TA \nwill incorporate a provision for project administration by a national capital markets expert. \n \n13.  Output 3: Transaction risks reduced. The TA will provide preliminary diagnostics and \ntechnical advice to modernize the payment system and reduce settlement risk. It will (i) support \ninitiatives to transfer the cash settlement leg of government securities transactions to SBV; (ii) \nprovide support to the development of an automated clearinghouse; (iii) strengthen the retail \npayments system and encourage cashless transactions; and (iv) provide initial diagnostics and \ntechnical advice to the Viet Nam Securities Depository to support the development of a limited \nCCP function. In addition, the TA will provide a framework for the eventual introduction of \nexchange-traded derivatives by providing technical advice covering a variety of key inputs \nincluding the legal framework, the role of exchanges, required risk management, and related \ncapacity development.10 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $720,000 of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodations,  basic  office \nsupplies, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The packaging of the consulting services may involve one or several packages and a \ncombination of firms and individuals.11 For specifically identified engagements, market testing \nand discussions with the executing agency will confirm the appropriate packaging prior to \nsoliciting expressions of interest. ADB will hire consulting firms, including the international legal \nexpert, through quality- and cost-based selection (80:20), according to its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).12 Individual consultants will be recruited \neither directly or through an organization using the individual consultant\u2019s selection procedure. \n                                                \n10 Government efforts will initially focus on equity derivatives given the relatively higher volumes and transparency \nassociated with equity trading. \n11  Packaging of consultant assignments may be combined under a firm: (i) international interbank market and lending \nspecialist, and international derivatives specialist; and (ii) international payment system specialist and international \nCCP expert. \n12  Single-source selection may be employed depending on the results of the ongoing legal survey. \n ", "  5 \nADB will manage the TA. Procurement, if necessary, will be conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n16.  The TA will provide an aggregate total of 24 person-months of consulting: 3 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  (accounting  expert)  and  3  person-months  of  international \nconsulting (debt resolution) will be dedicated to output 1; 6 person-months of national consulting \n(project administrator) and 3 person-months of international consulting (money market expert) to \noutput 2; and 9 person-months to output 3. The balance will be split evenly between three \ninternational consultants (payment system, equity derivatives, and CCP experts). An output-\nbased contract of $30,000 for an international legal firm will support consensus building and the \ndevelopment of a draft master repurchase agreement. ADB will partner with the International \nCapital Markets Association to provide stakeholder education utilizing an allocation of $5,000 for \nrepurchase workshops. A second fixed sum of $20,000 will be allocated to purchase a license \nand subscriptions to support the anticipated adoption of IFRS.13 Outline terms of reference are \npresented  in  Appendix  3.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be \nimplemented from 1 February 2015 to 31 January 2017. SBV will be the executing agency. The \nprimary  implementing  agencies  will  include  SBV  and  MOF,  along  with  their  agencies  and \nsupervised entities (e.g., VAMC, Viet Nam Securities Depository, and Hanoi Stock Exchange). \n \nE.  Governance \n \n17.  Since 2008, ADB has supported efforts to strengthen governance by improving planning \nprocesses, strengthening public financial management and pubic administration, and improving \nlegal transparency and accessibility.14 Public financial management reforms are at an early \nstage, but steady progress is being made, such as the adoption of the Anti-Corruption Law. \nUnder the National External Debt and Public Debt Strategy, 2011\u20132020, aggregate public debt \ninformation  was  published  for  the  first  time.15 In  spite  of  good  tax  collection  ratios,  the \ndetermination of actual budget deficits is compromised by the application of standards different \nfrom the Global Financial Statistics in the government\u2019s official accounts. Improved efficiency of \nbudget allocations and service delivery requires better linkages between medium-term planning \nand budgeting, and between capital and recurrent expenditures. The government is reviewing \nthe 2002 Budget Law to deepen implementation of the medium-term expenditure framework \nand  performance-based  budgeting,  and  to  improve  budget  execution,  monitoring,  and \nimplementation. The treasury and budget management information system is strengthening \ngovernment budget reporting and accounting. Tax management and customs modernization \nreforms are under way, increasing the transparency of administrative procedures and reducing \ncompliance costs for taxpayers. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for Strengthening Financial Markets, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n                                                \n13  This sum represents the published price of the noted products and services. \n14  ADB. 2008.
