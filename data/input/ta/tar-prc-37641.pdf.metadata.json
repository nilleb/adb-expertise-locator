During  the  2003  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA)1 to help the Hunan Provincial Government (HPG) prepare \na flood management project (the Project) for possible ADB financing. The Project will support \nthe  HPG  in  reducing  damage  caused  by  floods  by  improving  flood  mitigation  measures \nparticularly in the most affected municipalities and counties in the mountainous areas of Hunan \nProvince. The TA was included in the PRC country strategy and program for 2004. A fact-\nfinding mission visited the PRC in February 2004 to hold discussions with HPG staff, and to \ndraw up the detailed objectives, scope, costs, implementation, and financing arrangements for \nthe  project  preparation  TA  for  the  Hunan  Flood  Management  Project  (the  proposed  ADB \nProject). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Hunan Province touches the middle reaches of the Yangtze River to the north, while its \neast, west, and southern areas are mountainous. The northern area, which accounts for some \n25% of the area of the province, consists of Dongting Lake (covering about 7% of the province) \nand the low, flat floodplain of the Yangtze River. Hills in the central part of the province provide \na transition zone between the surrounding mountains and the Yangtze floodplain. The Li, Xiang, \nYuan, and Zi rivers, collectively termed the \u201cmountain rivers,\u201d flow northward to deliver runoff \nfrom the mountainous areas to Dongting Lake, which then drains water to the Yangtze River. \nThe orographical uplift of warm and wet frontal airflows over the mountains results in frequent \nrainstorms from April to October, which cause flash floods in the areas around the mountain \nrivers. Thus, Hunan is subject to two distinct types of floods: (i) Yangtze River floods__prolonged \nflooding  in  the  northern  part  of  the  province  caused  by  high  flow  in  the  Yangtze  River \nconstraining the outflow from Dongting Lake; and (ii) flash floods along the narrow strips of land \nof the steep mountain valleys. Cities and rural enterprises in the mountainous area of the \nprovince have typically developed along the narrow bottom lands flanking the mountain rivers \nand are thus exposed to the dangers of flash flooding and the consequent damage and loss of \nlife. Unlike the slowly rising inundation in the Dongting Lake area, flash floods require immediate \nand effective protection mechanisms, and a quick response to flood warnings and emergency \nactivities. Mountain river floods have been difficult to manage because the rapid onset of \nflooding does not provide much time for flood warning and response activities; high flood levels \nexacerbate flood hazard and damage, and curtail emergency transport operations. \n \n3.  Hunan Province consists of 14 municipalities and has 65 million people (2000). About \n70% of the municipal and county-level cities of the province are in mountainous areas. These \ncities  are  important  centers  of  government,  finance,  business,  education,  transportation, \nagriculture, and manufacturing. They produce machinery, textiles, metals, chemicals, paper \nproducts, mineral products, medicine, and processed food.  During the past 20 years, Hunan \nProvince has experienced rapid economic growth and urban expansion, and a steady increase \nin the urban population. The population of the urban areas in the mountainous cities is projected \nto increase by one third from the present levels (about 22 million) by 2010. However, the growth \nand economic development is constrained by the risk of damage from flash floods, from which \nthese cities have very little protection. As the urban areas grow, flash flood losses will increase \nyearly. The low level of flood protection now provided hinders economic growth and urgently \nneeds to be improved. \n                                                 \n1\n The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 August 2003. ", "2 \n4.  Yangtze and mountain river floods have caused enormous loss of life and damage in \nHunan Province. During the 1996 Yangtze flood, 145 flood protection dikes failed, forcing more \nthan 1 million people to live for up to several months along the remaining dikes, and resulting in \na  direct  economic  loss  of  over  $1.2  billion.  International  development  agencies  pay  much \nattention  to  the  Yangtze  River  floods  (under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Yangtze  River  Basin \nCommission),  and  international  flood  projects  in  Hunan  have  been  predominantly  directed \ntoward flood management in and around Dongting Lake.2 In the meantime, major flash floods \noccur frequently in the mountainous areas. Severe floods in recent years occurred in 1991, \n1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2002. The flood damage totaled $92 million in 1991, \n$229 million in 1993, and $373 million in 1994. Direct losses amounted to $1.2 billion in 1995, \n$2.4 billion in 1996, and $1.3 billion in 1998. During the 1996 flood, 130 people lost their lives. \nEach year, flash floods adversely affect almost 1 million people in the province, either through \nthe direct onset of floodwaters or through poor drainage in the aftermath (waterlogging), causing \nsocioeconomic damage and disruption that is almost as severe as that caused by Yangtze River \nfloods around Dongting Lake in the province. In the mountainous areas of Hunan Province, \ninternationally funded flood control projects have involved the construction of multipurpose \nreservoirs for hydroelectric power generation (under HPG).3 However, protection from mountain \nriver flash floods has so far received no funding support. Economic development is constrained \nas a result, and the lives and property of residents are endangered. \n \n5.  HPG has instituted various flood control measures. The Hunan Province Flood Control \nProgram4 provides a comprehensive framework for mitigating flooding along the four Mountain \nRivers  and  around  Dongting  Lake,  and  incorporates  improvements  in  flood  emergency \nmanagement and other nonstructural measures such as an improved data acquisition system to \nmonitor rainfall and river levels; improved communication and computer systems to facilitate \nflood  warning  and  the  management  of  flood  emergencies;  the  development  of  a  decision \nsupport system to more rapidly and reliably assess flood management options; and a review of \npolicies, laws, and regulations relating to flood and floodplain management. Under the Flood \nControl Program, HPG is investing $626 million of local funds in the current Five-Year Plan \n(2001\u20132005) to improve flood protection in cities across the province: $476 million (76%) is \nallocated for cities in the Donting Lake area and $150 million (24%) for cities in the mountainous \nareas ($110 million for municipal cities and $40 million for county-level cities). Flood control \ninvestments in the next Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) will be devoted solely to improving flood \nprotection  in  cities  in  the  mountainous  areas.  Accordingly,  in  2003,  HPG  initiated  a \n                                                 \n2\n The Japan Bank for International Cooperation is funding flood control improvements at 23 urban centers around \nDongting Lake ($200 million). The World Bank is funding a project to strengthen 142 kilometers of dikes along the \nYangtze River in Hunan Province and resettle 11,000 families ($27 million), and is supporting research into flood \ncontrol and waterlogging in Dongting Lake to improve early warning of impending floods and facilitate post-flood \ndrainage ($3 million). The Government of the Netherlands is funding a dredging project in Donting Lake to improve \nwater flow into and out of the lake for flood control ($25 million, in two tranches). Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment is funding the Yangtze River Flood Control and Management Project ($12 million), which will improve \nflood forecasting, flood warning, and the operation of flood detention basins along the middle reaches of the \nYangtze, including 24 detention basins (up to 300 square kilometers in area) around Dongting Lake. The Canadian \nInternational Development Agency has recently completed a major hydraulic modeling study to improve flood \nforecasting for Donting Lake. \n3\n The World Bank funded the recently completed Jiangya Multi-purpose Project on Loushui River, a tributary of Li \nRiver ($97 million). The governments of Austria, Canada, and Belgium, together with several private organizations, \nare funding seven hydropower projects in the mountainous areas of the province ($116 million in total), which \ninvolve the construction of relatively low dams (25\u201330 m high) that will provide some flood control capacity. \n4\n Formulated in 2000 and submitted to the Ministry  of Water Resources and National Development Reform \nCommittee in 2001, the program is the basis of the 11th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) and other relevant investment \nplanning by the province. ", "3 \ncomprehensive assessment and analysis of the flood-prone areas and recommended the early \nimplementation of flood protection measures in 36 cities and county-level cities. Initial designs \nand preliminary cost estimates have been prepared, largely for the structural measures. HPG is \naware of the need to review flash flood controls along the mountain rivers and identify the most \ncost-effective  mix  of  structural  and  nonstructural  measures.  Some  nonstructural  measures \nunder the Flood Control Program can be improved to better complement structural flood control \nmeasures in the mountainous areas. \n \n6.  The PRC Government has issued laws and regulations to promote integrated river basin \nmanagement in the PRC, including revisions in the 1988 Water Law (2002) and the Flood \nControl Law (1997). The aim is to balance all uses of the natural resources of a river basin, \nincluding flood control. The Flood Control Law (1997) outlines ways of identifying the causes of \nfloods and preparing and implementing remedial measures. Significant concepts embodied in \nthis law include soil and water conservation, dike strengthening, and nonstructural measures \nsuch as limited development in flood detention areas, land-use controls, and floodplain zoning. \nHPG\u2019s Flood Control Program is in line with PRC Government policies, and the proposed \nProject is under the overall flood management framework for the province and complements \nother internationally funded flood management projects in Hunan. \n \n7.  ADB has been increasingly involved in water resources management in the PRC and \nhas assisted the Government in incorporating integrated structural and nonstructural measures \nin the flood management strategies of previous projects. ADB has assisted the Yellow River and \nSonghua River basin commissions to strengthen their forecasting and warning systems.5 It has \nalso assisted the PRC Government with strategic planning for flood management, including the \ncomprehensive review of both structural and nonstructural management measures and policies, \nto identify further improvements. The proposed Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nsupports the PRC Government\u2019s objectives in the water sector. It will further help (i) integrate \nstructural and nonstructural measures to strengthen the Flood Control Program; (ii) assess the \ncost-effectiveness of selected structural and nonstructural measures, including flood zoning to \nprovide  for  future  urban  expansion;  and  (iii)  build  capacity  to  improve  the  flash  flood \nmanagement  decision  support  system.  HPG  recognizes  the  urgent  need  to  improve  flood \nprotection for cities in the mountainous area of the province to reduce the hazard and suffering \nthat flash floods inflict on populations at risk and to promote sustainable economic growth. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The TA will prepare an investment project suitable for ADB financing. It will assist HPG \nin (i) reviewing, assessing, and identifying cost-effective flood protection measures for the four \nmountain  rivers  of  Hunan  Province;  and  (ii)  formulating  an  improved  and  integrated  flood \nmanagement investment project with environmental impact assessment and resettlement plans \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s policy and guidelines. The ensuing investment Project will reduce the \nadverse economic, social, and environmental impact of flooding in urban areas along the four \nmountain rivers by improving flood mitigation at the 36 subproject sites. The preliminary project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n5\n ADB. 2001.

In the first phase (1.5 months), studies will be conducted \nto (i) assess flood phenomena, existing flood protection facilities and the appropriateness of \ntheir  design,  conditions  in  the  upper  watersheds,  hydro-meteorological  data,  flood \npreparedness, and zoning; (ii) review the Government\u2019s flood management strategies, priorities, \nand investment plans for the Flood Control Program, and in particular, assess the completeness \nand adequacy of the Flood Control Program for the mountainous areas in Hunan Province, on \nthe basis of technical, institutional, environmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant \nfactors; (iii) improve selection criteria and prioritize potential interventions on the basis of their \neconomic, financial, social, and environmental impact; the urgency of flood mitigation needs; \nand other criteria; and (iv) analyze background issues, constraints, proposed locations against \nselection criteria, institutional responsibilities, and other relevant sector work to provide rationale \nand opportunities of the investment project. In the second phase (2 months), the TA will  (i) \nformulate a balanced food management strategy for these areas comprising structural and \nnonstructural measures, (ii) undertake or update 36 feasibility studies on selected 36 high-\npriority areas, and (iii) assist HPG in preparing or strengthening draft environmental impact \nassessment and resettlement plans according to ADB\u2019s guidelines and policies. The initial \npoverty  and  social  analysis  shown  in  summary  form  in  Appendix  2  indicates  significant \nresettlement issues to be addressed in the project design and preferences of those affected. \nThe third phase of the TA will assist HPG in (i) formulating an overall investment project for ADB \nfunding; (ii) consolidating the feasibility studies prepared in the second phase; (iii) formulating \nprocurement needs and corresponding procurement arrangements; and (iv) determining if the \nProject is justified in financial, economic, social, and environmental terms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA will cost $875,000 equivalent, comprising $446,000 in foreign exchange costs \nand $429,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government requested ADB to finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost and $254,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be \nfinanced, on a grant basis, with a portion amounting to $550,000 equivalent, being financed by \nthe  Government  of  Spain,  and  $150,000  equivalent  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \nGovernment will provide the remaining local costs, equivalent to $175,000, to cover in-kind \ncounterpart costs and services. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project or to extending any further TA for the \nimplementation of any recommendations of the TA. The detailed cost estimates are given in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The Hunan Provincial Government will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will \nsupervise  and  monitor  TA  activities,  and  coordinate  with  government  agencies  and \norganizations. The Hunan Provincial Water Resources Department (HPWRD) will set up project \nmanagement offices at the provincial level and in each municipality and county in the Project \narea. The provincial project management office will be headed by an HPWRD deputy director \ngeneral and will include representatives from HPWRD, the Provincial Development and Reform \nCommission, and the Provincial Department of Finance. HPWRD will assign an experienced \nfull-time staff member to serve as TA task manager, and counterpart staff to work closely with \nthe TA consultants. HPWRD will also provide office space; access to communications and \ncopiers; and logistical support for TA implementation, including the conduct of socioeconomic, ", "5 \npoverty, and other required surveys. The Provincial Leading Group,6 chaired by a vice governor, \nwill guide TA implementation. The members of the group are senior provincial officials from the \ndepartments of water resources, agriculture, forestry, and urban construction; the Financial \nBureau; and the Planning and Reform Committee. \n \n12.  The TA will be carried out over 6 months, from July 2004 to January 2005. A total of 51.5 \nperson-months of consulting services will be required (14.5 international and 37 domestic). The \ninternational  consultants  will  provide  expertise  in  (i)  flood  management,  (ii)  financial  and \neconomic analysis, (iii) resettlement planning and social impact analysis (poverty reduction), \nand (iv) environmental impact assessment.
