THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Fiscal and Public Expenditure Management Program (FPEMP), \nand (ii) a proposed policy-based loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the \nFPEMP.1 \n \n2.  FPEMP supports the government\u2019s commitment to reduce household income inequality, \nand represents a medium- to long-term partnership between the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the government. The government\u2019s priority areas to reduce income inequality include \n(i) aligning medium-term expenditure and programs with its national medium-term development \nplan (RPJMN) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets,2 (ii) enhancing the national \npublic expenditure systems to improve quality of spending, and (iii) improving fiscal transfers \nand subnational governments\u2019 spending to promote better public service delivery.   \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  development  problem.  Indonesia  is  facing  the  twin  problems  of  prolonged \neconomic slowdown and rising household income inequality. Economic growth has steadily \ndeclined from 6.4% in 2010 to 4.8% in 2015, and is expected to remain only slightly above 5.0% \nin 2016 and 2017.3 Growth slowed initially because of falling commodity prices, which then fed \nback into lower growth in the non-resource sector, while new sources of growth have yet to \nemerge. The economic slowdown, combined with persistent volatility in the global financial and \ncommodity markets, also translated into lower fiscal revenue collection, which in turn challenges \nthe  government\u2019s  efforts  to  stimulate  the  economy.  Revenue  collection  fell  by  9.8%  from \nJanuary to April 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, and the government expects a \nshortfall of $16.7 billion in 2016. Given the constitutional limit on the budget deficit at 3.0% of \ngross domestic product (GDP), falling budget revenues impose constraints on the government\u2019s \nspending  in  the  social  sector  and  for  infrastructure,  even  though  these  are  necessary  to \novercome the income inequality problem. ADB analysis shows that expenditure on education \nand health is most sensitive to declines in revenue and to overall deficit levels, despite the \ngovernment being legally required to allocate 20% of the budget to education and 5% to health.4 \n \n4.  Against this backdrop of slower economic growth and increased fiscal pressures, the \ngovernment is finding it difficult to reverse the trend of rising income inequality. Since 2000, \nIndonesia has experienced one of the largest increases in household income inequality in \nSoutheast Asia. The Gini coefficient, which measures a country\u2019s household income inequality, \nincreased from 0.30 in 2000 to 0.40 in 2015. Income inequality is closely connected to poverty, \nespecially in rural areas, where it stands at 14.1% of the population (urban poverty: 7.8% of the \npopulation). Moreover, while 10.9% of the population lives below the poverty line, about 40% of \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  full  list  of  SDGs  is  available  at  http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-developmentgoals \n(accessed on 21 April 2016). Please refer to Measures to Implement SDGs (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n3  The government, the World Bank and ADB\u2019s updated Asian Development Outlook projects growth of 5.1%, and the \nInternational Monetary Fund projects growth of 4.9% for 2016. \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Expenditure and Fiscal Management (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). ", "2 \nall  people  remain  clustered  around  the  national  poverty  line.5 This  situation  is  caused  by \nunequal access to education, public services, and jobs; and by the fact that commodity-driven \neconomic growth creates few jobs and concentrates wealth.6 Uneven infrastructure investment \nand economic growth across provinces has widened regional income disparities and inequality; \nsome provinces in Eastern Indonesia significantly lag Java and Bali in per capita income.   \nFigure 1: Market and Net Inequality in Selected Association of Southeast Asian Nations Countries, 2000-2013 \n \nNote: The full length of the bars and the shorter bars represent market and net inequality respectively. The gap between market \nand net inequality (shaded areas) highlights the impact of social protection programs and government\u2019s redistribution policies.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on the Standardized World Income Inequality Database, 2014.  \n5.  Indonesia\u2019s  social  protection  programs  have  not  adequately  tackled  the  income \ninequality problem, as reflected in Figure 1,7 which reports two indexes taken from the recent \nInternational Monetary Fund study and the standardized world income inequality database.8 The \nfirst index\u2014the Market Gini Index\u2014 measures income inequality without subsidies and income \ntransfers to the population. This shows the counterfactual condition of what income inequality \nwould be without the government\u2019s income redistribution policies. The second index\u2014the Net \nGini Index\u2014measures income inequality with government subsidies and income transfers to the \npopulation and is the most commonly reported Gini index. The difference between the two \nindexes (represented by the shaded areas in Figure 1) shows the estimated reduction in income \ninequality as a result of the government\u2019s income redistribution policies. Figure 1 provides two \nconclusions.  First,  Indonesia\u2019s  Gini  index  has  increased  significantly,  while  Malaysia,  the \nPhilippines, and Thailand have all experienced declines in their Gini indexes between 2000 and \n2013. Second, Indonesia has been less successful in reducing income inequality through social \npolicies and programs than the other three countries. In 2013, Indonesia\u2019s income redistribution \npolicies reduced the Gini index from 44.8 to 42.0, or by 2.8 points, compared with much larger \nreductions in the Philippines (4.5 points), in Malaysia (4.0 points), and in Thailand (3.5 points).9  \n \n6.  Insufficient  public  spending  on  social  programs  and  infrastructure,  weaknesses  in \nnational  and  subnational  public  expenditure management  (PEM),  overreliance  on  universal \nprice subsidies (such as on energy), and poor targeting of income transfers to the population \nexplain the smaller reduction impact on income inequality in Indonesia. For example, public \n                                                \n5  Statistics  from  Indonesia\u2019s  National  Statistics  Office  and  the  World  Bank  Indonesia  Overview \nhttp://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/ (accessed 7 April 2016).  \n6  ADB.  2016.  Country  Partnership  Strategy:  Indonesia,  2016\u20132019:  Towards  a  Higher,  More  Inclusive  and \nSustainable Growth Path. Manila. \n7  Social Protection Programs Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  International Monetary Fund. 2014. Redistribution, Inequality, and Growth. Washington, DC and the Standardized \nWorld Income Inequality Database available at http://fsolt.org/swiid/ (accessed on 7 April 2016). \n9  There is a small discrepancy between data obtained from the database and government\u2019s official statistics.  \n ", "3 \nspending on health is about 3% of GDP\u2014one-third of the average in Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development economies\u2014and Indonesia ranks 147th out of 195 countries in \nhealth spending per capita. The low public spending is manifested in the poor performance of \nkey health indicators. For example, maternal mortality ratios stand at 359 for every 100,000 \nbirths, and infant mortality rates are at 22.8 for every 1,000 births in 2015. Although these \nindicators have improved, they are still relatively high for a middle-income country. Similarly, in \n2013,  Indonesia\u2019s  spending  on  education  was  17.6%  of  total  government  expenditure, \ncompared with 21.5% in Malaysia, 20.0% in Singapore, and 21.4% in Thailand. While the net \nenrollment rate in basic education stands at 95.5% in 2013, the rate for senior secondary \neducation falls steeply to only 57.7%. Public spending on infrastructure averaged 1.5% of GDP \nbetween 2008 and 2012, and Indonesia ranks 62nd out of 140 countries in the quality of overall \ninfrastructure, well below Malaysia (24th) and Thailand (44th). The SDGs stress the importance \nof targets related to health, education, social protection, and infrastructure quality to overcome \nincome inequality, so the government will have to boost volume and efficiency of spending to \nmeet these targets. There is an extensive volume of international empirical studies that show \nthat  an  efficient  and  effective  PEM  systems  (good  governance)  at  both  the  national  and \nsubnational government level enables a reduction in household income inequality through better \ndesign and targeting of pro-poor spending initiatives over the medium term (footnote 8).  \n \n7.  Binding  constraints.   The government  has recognized  the challenges  it  needs  to \naddress to improve social sectors and infrastructure spending: (i) poor alignment of medium-\nterm expenditures and programs with its RPJMN and SDGs targets, (ii) weaknesses in the \nnational PEM system that affect the quality of pro-poor spending, and (iii) poor quality of public \nservice delivery by subnational governments. These constraints are discussed in paras. 8\u201310. \n \n8.  Misalignment of medium-term expenditures and programs. Lessons learned from \nIndonesia\u2019s experience in implementing the Millennium Development Goals shows that meeting \ntargets requires sequential steps  such as mapping SDGs against the RPJMN targets and \ndevising an effective monitoring mechanism with regular reporting on implementation progress. \nTo  achieve  the  SDGs,  the  government  will  need  to  embed  these  targets  into  the  budget \nplanning process and medium-term expenditure of relevant line ministries, address funding \ndeficiencies in key social and infrastructure areas, and undertake incremental but vital reforms \nto social protection so they are fiscally sustainable while expanding program coverage to the \npoor. By 2016, 167 million citizens (65% of the population) were covered by the national health \ninsurance (JKN), although some of the poorest 40% can\u2019t afford the coverage. The monthly \npremium contributions of the non-poor beneficiaries are also very low at Rp19,225 per person \n(about  $1.50),  resulting  in  higher  public  subsidy    to  fully  fund  the  program  (the  subsidy \namounted to Rp20.3 trillion in 2015). Premium rates require upward adjustment to ensure JKN\u2019s \nfiscal sustainability. Another major anti-poverty program that needs reform is the subsidized rice \nprogram (RASKIN). The program benefits many poor families but is costly to run, and program \ntargeting could be improved. In 2015, the government allocated Rp18.9 trillion for the program, \nand 42.6% of households received support, greater than the intended target.  It is estimated that \neligible households receive only one-third of the subsidy (footnote 7). The RASKIN assistance \nprogram needs to be better targeted to the poor and this will require the use of information and \ncommunications technology to register beneficiaries and record benefit entitlements. \n \n9.  Weaknesses  in  national  public  expenditure  management.  Although  MOF  has \nintroduced the medium-term expenditure framework in 2011, weaknesses remain in budget \nplanning,  execution,  monitoring,  and  reporting  that  impede  quality  pro-poor  spending.  For \nexample, inconsistent information on government assets makes it difficult to manage assets and \nallocate  budget  for  maintenance  expenditure,  which  undermines  the  quality  of  public \n ", "4 \ninfrastructure investment. Another recurring constraint that has impeded pro-poor spending is \nthe low and delayed disbursement rates for capital spending, i.e., 50%\u201360% of disbursements \nare made in the last quarter of each fiscal year.10 These constraints are largely attributed to \ncumbersome and complicated reallocation procedures between spending units and expenditure \nprograms, and severe delays in procurement because of insufficient capacity in spending units. \nAnother constraint in PEM is the incomplete implementation of performance-based budgeting, \nwhich  is  important  for  embedding  RPJMN  targets  in  the  budget  process  and  monitoring \nprogress toward achieving them. Also, a budget reporting system is needed to support a robust \nmonitoring and evaluation process that gives more immediate information on spending impacts. \nFinally, macroeconomic risk analyses of the budget must be made transparent to ensure the \noverall  fiscal  sustainability  of  spending  goals.  The  2012  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability  Report  (PEFA)  noted  that  weaknesses  in  budget  execution,  such  as  high \nvariation between budget plans and outturns, affect the government\u2019s budget and expenditure \ncredibility.11 The  PEFA  report  rated  Indonesia\u2019s  aggregate  expenditure  outturn  as  C  and \ndowngraded  the  composition  of  expenditure  outturn  from  C  to  D.  Both  ratings  reflect  the \ngovernment\u2019s focus on expenditure controls rather than delivery and performance.  \n \n10.  Poor quality of public service delivery by subnational governments. The central \ngovernment implemented major local governance and fiscal decentralization reforms in 2001. \nThe government instituted four types of fiscal transfers: (i) general allocation to support basic \nspending  including  civil  service  salaries;  (ii)  specific  allocation  grant  (DAK)  for  specific \ninvestment expenditures aligned with national priorities; (iii) revenue-sharing fund which covers \nnatural  resources  and  tax  revenue;  and  (iv)  regional  incentive  fund  (DID)  to  incentivize \nsubnational governments\u2019 performance including on public financial management. While much \nwas accomplished, Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms remain a work in progress. The volume \nand  quality  of  local  public  service  delivery  varies  across  subnational  governments,  and \nimproving public service delivery in the poorer localities is a critical element of the government\u2019s \nefforts to reduce household income inequality. Two main factors impede quality of public service \ndelivery. First, fiscal transfers to poorer regions are insufficient to overcome funding deficiencies \nin social sectors and infrastructure therefore do not have the revenue equalizing effect intended, \nnor are they linked to improved performance in service delivery and financial management of \nsubnational governments (footnote 4). Second, PFM capacities are uneven especially in poorer \nregions. Different accounting and reporting systems are used leading to difficulties in monitoring \nby  the  central  government.  The  PEFA  report  (footnote  11)  graded  the  extent  of  central \ngovernment monitoring of subnational government\u2019s budget performance as C. One outcome of \nthese  weaknesses  is  that  even  when  transfers  are  made,  some  subnational  governments \ndeposit transfers into fixed-term accounts instead of spending for public service delivery, due to \ninability to plan expenditure\u2014the total of subnational governments\u2019 budget amounts deposited \nin banks increased from Rp52.2 trillion in 2009 to Rp99.13 trillion in 2012.  \n \n11.  Government  reform  agenda.  The  government\u2019s  approach  is  to  manage  the  twin \nproblems of the prolonged economic slowdown and rising household income inequality is built \naround two pillars. The first is to tackle household income inequality directly by implementing its \nSDGs\u2014aligning them with RPJMN targets, working out the cost and incorporating them into the \nmedium-term expenditure of line ministries, and addressing public spending deficiencies in the \nsocial sector and for infrastructure. The government will complement SDG implementation with \nnational  and  subnational  PEM  reforms  to  improve  the  quality  of  pro-poor  spending, \nreinforcement of performance incentives for fiscal transfers, and incremental but vital reforms to \n                                                \n10 International Monetary Fund. 2013.

Jakarta. \n ", "5 \nsocial protection programs. Fiscal decentralization is executed through the government\u2019s 2014 \ninstitutional transformation blueprint. The second pillar is to stimulate the economy through \nfiscal expansion with more spending on public infrastructure and the social sector, which is \nconsidered to have the largest multiplier effects on the economy. Fiscal savings of about Rp211 \ntrillion annually from the recent reduction in general subsidies to the non-poor will help fund the \ntargeted social protection programs and the fiscal stimulus. Even so, to fund the stimulus, the \ngovernment expects to operate much higher national government budget deficits close to the \nconstitutional limit of 3.0% and net financing needs estimated at $22.3 billion in June 2016. The \ngovernment is implementing reforms to boost fiscal revenue collection which should bear result \nin  the  medium-term.  In  the  long-term,  higher  economic  growth  will  be  achieved  through \nstructural reforms to the investment climate, access to finance, energy sectors, more public and \nprivate infrastructure investments, and reforms to basic education, all supported through other \nADB program and project loans as well as technical assistance (TA).   \n \n12.  ADB  experience.  ADB  has  long  supported  reforms  in  PEM  and  social  protection \nthrough several loan programs and TA (Figure 2). In 2005, the governance focus was on \nbuilding  a  modern  national  public financial management (PFM)  system  and  ADB  provided \nsupport in setting up the public debt management office. In 2008, this shifted to developing a \nstronger  intergovernmental  fiscal  and  governance  framework.  ADB's  support  produced \nmeasurable results, including introduction of financial management information system at 147 \nlocal  governments  and  devolution  of  local  taxes  to  subnational  governments.12 ADB  also \nsupported the development of a social protection framework such as the conditional cash \ntransfer program and fiscal sustainability of JKN.13 Since 2012, ADB provided TA to improve the \nfiscal sustainability of social security, strengthen the fiscal decentralization framework (including \nDAK reform), and support fiscal risk management from accelerated delivery of infrastructure \nprojects.14 Going forward, the FPEMP provides an umbrella operation supporting PEM reforms \nboth at national and subnational levels to better align SDGs with the RPJMN and the budget \nplanning process, address deficiencies in expenditure in social sectors and for infrastructure, \nand  improve  effectiveness  of  social  protection  programs.  The  FPEMP  supplements  ADB\u2019s \nprograms supporting the government to promote inclusive growth (footnote 6).15  \n \n13.  Lessons from the experience. ADB\u2019s experience provided three lessons that were \nincorporated  into  the  program.  First,  addressing  household  income  inequality  requires  a \ncomprehensive approach. This includes establishing an efficient PFM system to improve quality \nof spending and reforms to social protection to enable better targeting of pro-poor interventions. \nADB\u2019s previous Development Policy Support programs (footnote 13), and international empirical \nevidence shows a direct link between improvements in PEM and a reduction in poverty and the \nGini index (footnote 8).

This requires coordination across \nADB including TA support and knowledge products on social protection and health  sector \nreforms  to  achieve  SDGs targets from the  Sustainable  Development and  Climate  Change \nDepartment.16   \nFigure 2: ADB\u2019s Engagement in Public Expenditure Management and Structural Reform Agenda \nTTAA:  T=e cthencichanl Aicsasils taanscsei s tance. \nSSoouurcrec: eA:s iAanD DBev seltoapfmf.e nt Bank   \n14.  ADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB has given direct \nsupport to selected reforms that underpin FPEMP. ADB provided TAs to improve the fiscal \nsustainability of social security reforms including JKN and strengthening fiscal decentralization \nframework including introduction of performance based grant mechanism (footnote 13-14). ADB \nalso  helped  improve  the  fiscal  transfer  mechanism  by  creating  forward  estimates  for \nintergovernmental  financing,  upgrading  the  design  and  monitoring  of  DAK,  and  providing \ncapacity building on fiscal decentralization. ADB support in JKN reforms resulted in upward \nadjustments in premiums which improved JKN\u2019s financial sustainability. In addition, ADB is \nproviding TA support to the education sector including capacity development of subnational \ngovernments in 108 districts and municipal administrations  in 16 provinces to achieve the \nminimum  service  standards  for  basic  education.17 A  TA  is  being  prepared  to  help  the \ngovernment monitor and report progress in achieving the SDGs.  \n \n15.  Development partner coordination. Development partner coordination is strong in the \narea  of  fiscal  policy  and  PFM.  The  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  is \nconsidering parallel financing for subprogram 1 with an indicative amount of \u20ac200 million. Both \nthe ADB and KfW teams have worked closely with the government in formulating the program, \nincluding the policy matrix. The World Bank supports the government\u2019s efforts on revenue \nmobilization through its development policy loan. Close coordination between ADB, the IMF, the \nWorld  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  created  strong  programmatic  synergies  in \nsupporting  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  policy  and  PEM  reforms.  The  government  leads  the \ndevelopment partner coordination for assistance in decentralization, fiscal and PEM policies at \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2015.

The \ngovernments of Australia, France, Germany, and the United States are also active in PFM.18 \n \n16.  The programmatic approach and policy-based loans. The programmatic approach \nthrough policy-based loans was chosen over other financing modalities because it is the most \neffective in: (i) implementing policies to achieve RPJMN and SDGs targets; (ii) leveraging \nreforms to PEM to make social protection programs fiscally sustainable; (iii) contributing to filling \nthe gap in the government\u2019s financing needs to address funding deficiencies in education, \nhealth, social protection and infrastructure; and (iv) enabling ADB to have a medium-term \nengagement  with  the  government.  The  program  will  have  two  subprograms  covered  by  a \nmedium-term results framework that reflects the long-term engagement between ADB and the \ngovernment  on  fiscal  policy  and  PEM  reform.  Subprograms  3  and  4  may  be  included \nsubsequently  and  will  be  formulated  during  the  processing  of  subprogram  2  to  ensure  a \ncontinuous dialogue with stakeholders on emerging policy priorities including domestic revenue \nmobilization and the government\u2019s request. Flexibility is retained in determining the loan size \ndepending on the financing needs of the government in this period of revenue uncertainty.    \n \n17.  Economic impact of the program. The three outputs of the program combined are \nexpected to lead to improved social sector and infrastructure spending. The following potential \neconomic  gains  are  to  be  achieved  through  efficiency  gains:  (i)  medium-term  expenditure \naligned with RPJMN; (ii) national public expenditure system enhanced; and (iii) transfers and \nsubnational governments\u2019 spending on service delivery improved (para. 28). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The  impact  will  be  reduced  household  income  inequality  as  measured  by  the  Gini \ncoefficient in alignment with the government\u2019s RPJMN targets. The outcome will be social sector \nand infrastructure spending improved. The program will include a series of policy reforms and \ninterventions  and  is  designed  to  deliver  three  outputs.  Subprogram  1  contains  12  reform \nactions, which the government completed between January and August 2016. Subprogram 2 \ncontains 12 reform policy actions, six of which are expected prior actions (triggers).  \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n19.  Output  1:  Medium-term  expenditures  aligned  with  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan and Sustainable Development Goals\u2019 targets. This output will align the \ngovernment\u2019s medium-term expenditure with RPJMN and SDGs targets, increase spending in \nsocial sectors and infrastructure and reform social protection programs.  Achievements under \nsubprogram  1  included  the  following.  In  2016,  the  government  developed  the  SDG \nimplementation framework. The Presidential Regulation submitted to the Cabinet Secretariat \nlaid out implementation plans in a sequential manner, including mapping the SDGs targets \nagainst existing targets in RPJMN and setting up a steering committee chaired by the Minister \nof National Development Planning Agency to coordinate implementation. The additional fiscal \nspace created by the reduction in general subsidies  was utilized to increase spending on \neducation, health, social protection, and infrastructure. In the 2016 budget, the government \nimplemented a 5% budget allocation to health (compared to 3.8% of total spending in the 2015 \nbudget), which amounts to a 39% increase in health spending. The 2016 education budget \nincreased by 2.0% over the 2015 budget, which translated to a small decline in spending when \nadjusted for inflation. Social protection programs received a five-fold increase in the 2016 \n                                                \n18 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nbudget allocation.  The government, through the Social Security Agency, implements the JKN, \nwhich guarantees participants\u2019 access to basic health care. The government provides subsidies \nto those who fall within the bottom 40% of Indonesia\u2019s income distribution. In 2016, the number \nof subsidy recipients increased from 88.2 million to 92.4 million, representing 37% of the bottom \n40% of the population. In addition, the government implemented a 20% increase in the health \ninsurance premium of better off beneficiaries to improve the fiscal sustainability of the JKN. The \ngovernment also approved implementation of non-cash social protection (smart card) to improve \ntargeting and efficiency of the subsidized rice program (RASKIN).  \n \n20.  For subprogram 2, the government will delineate responsibilities of line ministries for \nSDG implementation and provide periodic reporting of progress achieved. The government will \nalso implement (i) measures to improve the targeting, coverage, and monitoring of its social \nprotection programs, (ii) inflation-adjusted spending increases in education and health aligned \nwith mandated target and (iii) inflation adjusted spending increase in public infrastructure.  \n \n21.  Output 2: National public expenditure system enhanced. This output will improve the \nnational  PEM  with  a  focus  on  disbursement,  reporting  and  evaluation.  Accomplishments \nincluded  under  subprogram  1  included  the following. The government  adopted  information \ntechnology tools (i) which required line ministries to prepare standardized budget proposal \nfocusing on output and outcomes and (ii) through Ministry of Finance implemented online \nmonitoring  of  budget  implementation  including  revenue,  expenditure  and  financing.  Both \nreforms are part of the broader integrated financial management information system supporting \nperformance-based budgeting. The government also established a budget realization evaluation \nand monitoring team headed by the Minister of Finance to speed up budget execution.  The \nstate treasury and budget system aims to manage all financial transaction data of the central \ngovernment in a full cycle, from budget appropriation to production of financial statements.  \n \n22.  For subprogram 2, the government will simplify budget execution, such as giving line \nministries more flexibility, and improve online monitoring of financial management information. \n \n23.  Output 3: Fiscal transfers and subnational governments\u2019 spending for service \ndelivery improved. This output will strengthen subnational PFM system to improve budget \nexecution.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  1  included  the  following.  The  government \nincreased allocation and better-targeted fiscal transfers. In 2016, 51% of the national budget \nconsists of transfers to subnational governments. This is a significant increase in the overall \nDAK \u2014from Rp58.8 trillion in 2015 to Rp211 trillion in 2016\u2014 and in DAK allocation for health \nservice: from Rp6.8 trillion in 2015 to Rp20.9 trillion in 2016. The government also increased \nDID allocation from Rp1.6 trillion in the revised 2015 national budget to Rp5.0 trillion in the \nnational  budget  for  2016.  To  provide  incentives  for  better  performance  by  subnational \ngovernments, the government integrated local government rating on PFM and public services \ndelivery to determine DID allocation. Finally, to address idle funds, the government implemented \ngovernment bond transfers to subnational governments with low levels of budget execution. \n \n24.  For subprogram 2, the government will implement a monitoring and evaluation system of \nthe  DAK  for  health,  education,  and  local  infrastructure;  refine  subnational  governments\u2019 \nperformance indicators to improve the selection criteria for recipients of DID; and reinforce \nmeasures to address idle funds and slow budget execution at subnational governments\u2019 level.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs  \n \n25.  The government has requested a policy-based loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \n ", "9 \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the \naverage loan maturity is 9.25 years, and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. The proceeds \nof  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  Indonesia  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time).  \n \n26.  The net development financing needs are estimated between $22.3 billion and $26.8 \nbillion, and the budget deficit between 2.4% and 2.8% of GDP depending on final tax revenue \ncollection. To finance the deficit, the government planned to raise $5.5 billion from official \nforeign loans (including USD 2.7 billion of program loans). The size of subprogram 1 primarily \nreflects  the  government\u2019s  financing  needs,  the  strength  of  the  reform  program,  and  the \nimplementation costs, including increasing JKN subsidies for the bottom 40% and boosting \nspending on education and health (para. 28). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The Ministry of Finance\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency as the executing agency is responsible \nfor coordinating the government\u2019s FPEMP-related reforms. Implementing agencies include the \ndirectorates general of budget, treasury, and fiscal balance. SDG implementation, monitoring, \nand progress reports will be through the national steering committee on SDG implementation. \nThe implementation period is January 2015 to August 2016 for subprogram 1 and September \n2016 to November 2017 for subprogram 2.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  The program will have positive economy-wide impacts. The program impact assessment \nestimates  the  potential  new  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  program  at  $6.4  billion,  under \nconservative discounting assumptions, which well exceed the program\u2019s costs.19 Using the \nsocial accounting matrixes, the reallocation of general subsidies to additional expenditure on \nhealth and education is estimated to yield a benefit of $3.0 billion, social protection at $7.3 \nbillion, and infrastructure at $1.6 billion. Strengthening subnational PEM systems, increasing \nfiscal transfer and design of DAK and DID, is estimated to yield a benefit of $8.8 billion. The \nreforms and associated higher expenditures will entail costs of about $14.8 billion.   \n \nB.  Governance \n \n29.  The government has made considerable progress in improving the legal and regulatory \nframework for PFM. Since the enactment of laws on state finance, state treasury, and state \naudit in 2003\u20132004, most regulations underpinning these laws have been promulgated. In 2012, \nthe number of government agencies that received an unqualified audit opinion from the external \naudit agency increased to 65% (from about 40% in 2009). ADB has reinforced this momentum \nwith  continuing  support  to  improve  technical  capacity  on  state  audit.  As  a  result  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s continuing commitment to reducing corruption, the capacity of the Corruption \nEradication  Commission  has  improved  markedly.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n                                                \n19 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  The reforms supported under the program will help reduce income inequality. More pro-\npoor spending and better-targeted subsidies will benefit the bottom 40% of the population. \nImproved  PEM  systems  and  additional  and  better-designed  fiscal  transfers  to  subnational \ngovernments will benefit the poor through improved targeting of assistance. Subprogram 1 is \ncategorized as no gender elements, but ADB will discuss with government to elevate future \nsubprograms to at least some gender elements.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Following an assessment of the proposed policy actions, the program will not have any \nlikely  social  safeguard  issues  and  is  assigned  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.20 The expected net benefits and impacts of the program are expected to \noutweigh  the  risks.  Weakness  in  PEM  and  inadequate  capacity  are  risks  that  may  slow \nimplementation  of  RPJMN  and  SDG  targets.  Revenue  shortfall  may  also  undermine \ngovernment\u2019s proposed spending in social sector and for infrastructure. ADB is supporting \nstrengthening PEM through the program and is providing TA to improve capacity on state audit \nand SDG implementation in health and education (footnotes 16 and 17).  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION  \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Fiscal and Public Expenditure Management \nProgram, and  \n(ii)  the loan of $500,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the \nFiscal  and  Public  Expenditure  Management  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of \n15 years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n                  Takehiko Nakao \nPresident \n19 October 2016 \n                                                \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible form the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nHousehold income inequality reduced (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019)a \n    Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and   \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020    Continuous market \nSocial sector and      turmoil and low \ninfrastructure  a.
