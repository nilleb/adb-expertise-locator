INTRODUCTION \n1.  At  a  meeting  in  Jakarta  in  February  1998,  finance  ministers  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) broached the concept of an ASEAN economic surveillance \nprocess. The concept was predicated on assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nExtensive consultations on the objectives and scope of this assistance subsequently took place \nbetween ADB and officials of ASEAN member governments. ADB also consulted with the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) on its support for the ASEAN economic surveillance process. \n \n2.  In October 1998, the ASEAN finance ministers assented to a \"Terms of Understanding \nfor the Implementation of an ASEAN Surveillance Process\" (TOU). The process as outlined in \nthe TOU anticipates close collaboration between ASEAN, ADB, and IMF. The TOU also directs \nthat the ASEAN surveillance process (ASP) be supported by the establishment of an ASEAN \nSurveillance Coordination Unit (ASCU) within the ASEAN secretariat in Jakarta. ASCU will be \nresponsible for coordinating, reviewing, consolidating, and preparing all surveillance materials \nfor consideration by the ASEAN Select Committee (comprising deputies of finance ministries \nand central banks) and by the ASEAN finance ministers' meetings. ASCU will also coordinate \nsurveillance  matters  between  individual  ministries,  central  banks,  and  other  institutional \nstructures within ASEAN. \n \n3.  The ASEAN finance ministers' meeting formally requested ADB on 10 November 1998 \nto  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  training  and  capacity  building  in  support  of  ASP. \nFollowing a Fact-Finding Mission to ASCU in December 1998, ADB approved a regional TA1 in \nthe same month. In this program, 3-5 ASEAN officials were seconded to ADB for approximately \n3 months to undergo training in surveillance-related issues. The TA ended in May 2002 after \ntraining 27 officials from the ASEAN countries. To complement the training program, TA 60192 \nwas processed in 2002. This TA provides shorter (3 weeks) but more intensive and structured \ntraining for busy mid-level ASEAN officials from the ministries of finance and central banks.  As \nof October 2002, 32 officials (in two cohorts) have been trained under this TA.   \n \n4.  The deputy finance ministers of ASEAN have requested the continuation of ADB support \nfor  enhancing  surveillance-related  capacity  in  their  respective  countries.  In  particular,  the \ndeputies asked that the longer, on-the-job type training component be retained in any future \nADB program to complement the shorter and more structured training program. The format and \nscope of the training program in the proposed TA was discussed with the ASEAN deputy \nfinance ministers at the October meeting in Myanmar, and all deputies supported the proposal. \nThe capacity to conduct economic surveillance activities effectively in many of the ASEAN \ncountries, particularly in the new member countries, remains weak, and further support is \nwarranted. The TA is designed to bring together the strengths identified in the two previous \ncapacity-building TAs, while addressing their shortcomings. The objectives, scope, financing \nplans, and implementation arrangements are reflected in this paper. The TA framework is \nattached as Appendix 1.3 \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

Technical Assistance for Technical Training and Capacity Building in Support of the ASEAN Economic \nSurveillance Process, Phase II. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 March 2002. ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The ASEAN economies participate in both national and global surveillance processes \nthat are led by IMF. The results of the national surveillance activities undertaken by IMF are \nlargely confidential and are shared only with the concerned governments, and focus mainly on \ndomestic policy concerns. While global surveillance activities provide an important context for \ndomestic policy formulation, they do not contain the detailed analyses that are needed to \nsupport effective policy dialogue among regional economic partners. ASP seeks to fill these \ngaps by facilitating the exchange of crucial economic and financial information among countries, \nby developing an institutional process that will permit more effective coordination of responses \nto evolving economic and financial circumstances both within the region and outside, and by \nfocusing on sectoral and structural as well as macroeconomic issues. Through the opportunities \nit offers for peer monitoring consultation and dialogue, ASP will also act as a vehicle to help \nimprove national policies and facilitate economic reform. \n \n6.  For ASP to meet its stated objectives, the capacity to undertake economic surveillance \nactivities in ASEAN countries needs to be enhanced. ADB was requested to play a key role in \nenhancing capacity and has been responding since the inception of ASP. The first phase of the \ntraining program had ASEAN officials from Brunei Darussalam (on a full cost recovery basis, \nsee footnote 4), Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), Myanmar, \nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The training program focused mainly on developing on-\nthe-job experience of economic surveillance and policy analysis. Each cohort of ASEAN officials \nspent approximately 3 months at ADB as secondees undergoing training. The focus was on the \nfollowing activities: managing macroeconomic and financial information systems; monitoring \nglobal  economic  developments  that  affect  opportunities  and  create  risks  for  the  region; \ndeveloping country macroeconomic and financial frameworks; conducting country policy reviews \nand consultations; and identifying sound institutional practices for macroeconomic and financial \nmanagement. \n \n7.  ADB staff and consultants closely supervised and regularly evaluated the work of the \nsecondees.  The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with secondees expressing the general \nview  that  the  training  has  been  very  beneficial  in  building  their  capacity  to  perform \nsurveillance-related tasks in their home countries. \n \n8.  The shorter and more structured second phase 3-week training program (footnote 2) had \nparticipants from all 10 ASEAN countries.  It is worth noting that Singapore and Malaysia, who \nhad not participated in the 3-month program, sent representatives to the shorter program.   \n \n9.  The feedback from the participants of the 3-month program and the 3-week program will \nbe an important input in preparing the training course for the second phase. Indeed, the third \nphase will bring together the strong points of both the 3-month and 3-week program and try to \navoid their shortcomings. For example, the structured refresher course in macroeconomics, \nfocusing on conceptual and policy aspects, from the 3-week program will be retained in a \nslightly modified form, as will the problem-solving type exercises using the case study approach.  \nThe on-the-job type training used in the 3-month program will also be retained although in a \nmore compact and refined manner, and much of this will form the special topics (or second) part \nof the training program. The feedback suggests that various aspects of the 3-month program \ncan  be  either  remodeled  or  restructured  to  fit  into  a  shorter  time  frame.  Responses  from \nparticipants in the 2 programs suggest that the duration of the third phase program should lie \nsomewhere between 3 weeks and 3 months.  With the changes proposed, the third phase \n ", "  3 \ncourse can be conducted in a time frame of 6 weeks. Much of the course and training material \ndeveloped in the first and second phases can be used, with minor alterations. \n  \n10.  ADB  is  uniquely  positioned  to  assist  ASEAN  in  developing  its  regional  economic \nsurveillance initiative through the proposed training program. ADB has accumulated extensive \nexperience  in  an  area  that  its  charter  expressly  mandates\u2014the  promotion  of  regional \ncooperation. ADB has also worked widely with its developing member countries (DMCs) to \npromote structural reform of their financial sectors and is continuing to build expertise in this \narea. In a context where change and reform at the global, regional, and national levels are \nneeded, regional development organizations, such as ADB, have an important role to play in \ncomplementing the resources of lMF and the World Bank. ADB's technical assistance resources \nare a particularly effective modality for capacity building and institutional strengthening that are \nessential for a credible surveillance process, as well as meeting the broader challenge of \nbuilding more robust financial and economic systems. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The  TA\u2019s  principal  objective  is  to  train  officials  from  ASEAN  member  countries  in \neconomic and financial surveillance and related policy-making activities, in support of ASP.  \nSince the training program is also available to ASCU staff, the TA will also assist ASCU in its \neconomic surveillance activities. A by-product of the training program will be the improved \ninformation flows and ADB's knowledge of the opportunities and risks facing its DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The proposed 6-week training program can be broadly divided into 2 parts. In the first \npart, which will run for approximately 2 weeks, participants will have an intensive review of \nmacroeconomic  analysis  and  the  interrelated  accounting  and  analytic  framework  used  by \ngovernment authorities in establishing their macroeconomic and financial policies.  The material \nwill  be  developed  from  a  practitioner\u2019s  perspective  and  will  discuss  the  various  important \neconomic issues that policy makers have faced in recent years. Problem-solving workshops in \nfiscal,  monetary,  and  balance-of-payments  issues  and  in  overall  economic  and  financial \nprogramming will allow participants to use concepts developed in the lecture material. Building \non this background, the second part of the program will focus on specialized topics of economic \nsurveillance. The topics will include the development of macro and micro prudential indicators of \nfinancial system soundness, formulation of early warning systems (EWS) of economic crisis, \nanalysis of leading economic indicators, use of global and regional surveillance information \nsystems, issues and progress in developing a new international financial architecture, and \nissues relating to macroeconomic policy and poverty reduction.  \n \n13.  Although participation in this training program will be open to all ASEAN countries,4 it is \nexpected, and indeed intended, that the new member countries of ASEAN participate to a high \ndegree. The capacity to conduct economic monitoring and surveillance activities in countries \n                                                 \n4  Brunei Darussalam is a member of ASEAN, but not of ADB. Should Brunei Darussalam elect to participate in this \nTA, such participation would be subject to bilateral negotiation between ADB and the Government of Brunei \nDarussalam and would require full cost recovery. Singapore is a member of ASEAN and ADB but has graduated \nfrom ADB assistance. Singapore may elect to receive ADB assistance on a reimbursable basis. \n \n ", "4   \nsuch as Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, and to a lesser extent, Viet Nam is still relatively \nweak, and additional assistance is required. Participation in all TA activities will however, be on \na purely voluntary basis.  \n \n14.  Officials  will  be  selected  from  the  finance  ministries  and  central  banks  of  ASEAN \ncountries  or  from  the  ASEAN  secretariat  in  Jakarta.  They  will  have  these  minimum \nqualifications: \n \n(i)  a  bachelor\u2019s  degree  (or  the  equivalent)  in  economics  or  finance  from  a \nrecognized university, and preferably a postgraduate qualification in the same, \n(ii)  at least five years relevant professional work experience, and \n(iii)  fluency in written and spoken English. \n \n15.  While  governments  will  initially  select  candidates  for  training  and  forward  their \nnominations to ASCU, ADB will retain the right to decline nominations that do not meet the \ncriteria. It is expected that officials who are selected for training at ADB will be assigned \nresponsibilities for ASEAN surveillance activities on completion of the training. A precondition \nfor participation in the training program will be the commitment of the participants to resume \nduties with either their governments or ASCU in Jakarta. \n \n16.  The TA will finance the training of approximately 30 mid-level officials in 3 batches of 10 \nministry of finance and central bank officials within 1 year. ADB staff and consultants will handle \nthe training. ADB will provide round-trip airfare, per diem, and mission travel expenses for the \ntrainees. During the training period, the respective governments will meet the salaries of the \ntrainees. The trainees will not be employees of ADB. Any privileges and immunities that the \nPhilippine Government grants to trainees will be a matter for negotiation between ASEAN and \nthe Government of the Philippines.  \n \n17.  The activities will expose trainees to economic and financial data systems, emerging \ndata  standards,  EWS  and  macroeconomic  models,  methods  of  policy  analysis,  codes  of \nconduct for monetary and fiscal policy, and international standards in areas such as bank \nsupervision and securities regulation. Taken together, these activities will help develop the \ntechnical skills and practical experience needed to sustain and support full ownership of ASP. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n18.  The total estimated cost of the TA is $390,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  ASEAN  secretariat  and  ASEAN  member \ngovernments will provide counterpart support including salaries of participants estimated at \n$90,000. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The ASEAN secretariat will be the Implementing Agency for the TA. Implementation will \nbe conditional on ASEAN's formal agreement\u2014contained in a Letter of Agreement\u2014to the \nstructure and conditions of this TA. \n \n20.  ASCU within the ASEAN secretariat is responsible for ASP and will be responsible for  \nimplementing the TA. ASCU\u2019s responsibilities are to screen and make the final list of trainees for \nADB's consideration, and to maintain all official contact with national governments and their \nrespective agencies. \n ", "  5 \n \n21.  The trainees will be located in the ASEAN Surveillance Technical Support Unit (ASTSU) \nwithin ADB. ASTSU will have no autonomous implementation responsibilities for the TA, and its \noperational assignments will be determined by Regional Economic Monitoring Unit (REMU) in \ncollaboration with ASCU. ADB staff and consultants will train ASTSU trainees, and ADB will \nprovide other resources needed for the routine operations and viability of ASTSU. \n \n22.  Responsibility for executing the TA will rest with ADB. REMU, in consultation with the \nregional  departments  and  the  Economics  and  Research  Department,  will  take  the  lead  in \nexecuting the TA. The TA will be for 12 months, starting in January 2003; it is scheduled to be \ncompleted by the end of December 2003. \n \n23.  The terms of reference for two international consultants to be engaged for the training \nprogram are in Appendix 3. One international consultant will have experience in all aspects of \nmacroeconomics and financial monitoring activities and will have taught macroeconomics and \nfinancial  programming  to  developing  country  officials  of  various  backgrounds  in  a  short-\ncourse/workshop environment. The other international consultant will be an expert in developing \nfinancial and capital markets including developing indicators of financial soundness and models \nof EWS, as well as financial and corporate governance matters included in the current effort to \nstrengthen the international financial architecture. The TA provides for 3 person-months of \ninternational  consulting  services,  with  each  international  consultant  to  be  engaged  for  1.5 \nperson-months over the period of the TA. Recruitment will follow ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nTechnical Training and Capacity Building in Support of the ASEAN Economic Surveillance \nProcess Phase III, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \nGoal       \nReduce economic and    Early indications of    Indicators of financial   \nfinancial vulnerability   impending economic  and economic   \n  shocks  vulnerability   \n    Full reports available    Macroeconomic and   \n  with clear  financial performance   \n  macroeconomic action  indicators   \n  plans at the outset of    Semiannual ASEAN   \n  such shocks  finance ministers and   \n    deputy finance ministers\u2019   \n    meetings, where recent   \n  economic developments   \nwill be reviewed and   \ndiscussed   \nPurpose       \nStrengthen economic    Complement    Semiannual ASEAN  Continued support and \npolicy making and  International Monetary  finance ministers and  commitment to the \ninstitutions in the  Fund surveillance with  deputy finance ministers\u2019  ASEAN surveillance \nAssociation of Southeast  structural and sectoral  meetings, where recent  process (ASP) from \nAsian Nations (ASEAN)  monitoring  economic developments  ASEAN member \ncommunity    Accelerate reforms  are reviewed and  countries \nand build a platform for  discussed.
