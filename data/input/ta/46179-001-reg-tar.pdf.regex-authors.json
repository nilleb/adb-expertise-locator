INTRODUCTION \n1.  Country portfolio review missions and regular project supervision missions continue to \nobserve delays in project implementation caused by executing agency\u2019s lack of understanding \nand familiarity with the project implementation procedures of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). This includes procurement and consulting policies and difficulties in terms of project and \ncontract  management  during  implementation.  Discussions  have  been  held  with  regional \ndepartments and these have highlighted the need for the ADB Central Operations Services \nOffice (COSO) to lead a technical assistance (TA) project that would help provide support to \nADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  this  respect.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  regional  departments  have  highlighted  lack  of  capacity  for  effective  project \nimplementation as a constraint for good project performance.   ADB is providing increased \nsupport to its DMCs\u2014the active portfolio on 31 December 2011 totaled $58.8 billion, $4.9 billion \n(9%) more than its value a year earlier. The number of projects increased from 576 projects to \n612 projects over the same period. As ADB's operations have increased, the complexity of the \nprojects and the modalities offered have also increased. At the same time, ADB is operating in \nnew  sectors,  and  in  remote  and  poor  areas  of  countries  where  capacity  for  project \nimplementation is weak. All of these factors affect the overall quality of project implementation. \n \n3.  The  Development  Effectiveness  Review2 also  shows  that,  while  project  outputs  for \n2009\u20132011 remained on track for ADB operations, project delays and cancellations resulted in \nlower output delivery, in particular for Asian Development Fund operations. Even the best \ndesigned  project  will  fail  to  deliver  results  if  implementation  falls  short.  The  2011  Annual \nPortfolio Performance Report3 notes that implementation is delayed by poor quality procurement \nplans and poor contract packaging, which results in significant administrative cost to ADB and \nexecuting agencies. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 identifies capacity development as a driver of change \nthat provides ADB with an opportunity to be an active and supportive development partner.4  \n \n4.  In June 2010, a project implementation working group was established with a mandate \nto identify key issues and regional department good practices that could be replicated or applied \nmore  widely  across  ADB  to  improve  project  implementation.  The  good  practices  and \nrecommendations were identified under three themes: (i) achieving total project readiness, (ii) \nenhancing  organization,  staff  skills  and  incentives,  and  (iii)  ensuring  effective  project \nimplementation.5 To respond to the latter, this regional TA will support project cycle capacity \ndevelopment of executing agencies, including increased implementation capacity and project \nmanagement skills.  \n \n5.  The  regional  TA  puts  effective  project  implementation  at  the  core  of  good  project \nmanagement and provides capacity building support for project implementation. Since 1978, \nADB  has  funded  project  implementation  and  administration  seminars  with  TA  grants  to \nstrengthen the capacity of borrowers and executing agencies to manage projects financed by \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 November 2012. \n2  ADB. 2012.

Good Project Implementation Practice: Report of the Project Implementation Working Group. Manila \n ", "2   \nADB. Senior and mid-level officials of executing agencies, central ministries, state banks, and \nstate and provincial governments from 34 DMCs have participated in and benefited from these \nseminars, which have centered on policies and procedures for the procurement of goods, works, \nand consulting services, project and contract management, and for disbursement of loan and \ngrant proceeds. \n \n6.  There is a need to develop high-quality training programs with a new approach that will \nincrease capacity for effective project implementation (see paragraph 9 and 10). Such capacity \ndevelopment  support  will  lead  to  effective  and  efficient  project  management.  The  TA  will \nleverage  existing  regional  department  initiatives  for  increased  capacity  for  project \nimplementation and knowledge of the DMCs, and share lessons in project implementation from \nother countries.6 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The expected impact of the regional TA is effective project implementation in selected \nDMCs. The TA outcome will be improved capacity of executing agencies in implementing ADB-\nfinanced projects in selected DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will deliver training programs to EAs\u2019 staff working on ongoing and future ADB-\nfinanced projects. The output of the TA is \u2018good quality training programs are delivered in key \ndeveloping member countries up to 2014\u2019. Key activities to achieve the TA output include (i) \ntraining needs assessment, (ii) training calendar, (iii) developing new e-learning approaches and \ninnovative interventions throughout the project cycle, (iv) short training programs that are more \nneeds specific, and (v) output monitoring systems. \n \n9.  A training calendar for 2013\u20132014 will be developed in consultation with the regional \ndepartments and will list all training events, with tentative target DMCs and dates, based on the \nfinding  of  the  training  needs  assessment.  The  training  calendar  will  be  updated  regularly, \ncirculated widely, and posted on the ADB website. This will enable executing agencies to plan \nstaff participation in advance. The demand-based interface will ensure targeted interventions.  \n \n10.  A review of COSO training content will be undertaken. The training materials will be \nupdated, and more and updated case studies introduced. E-learning and other media, such as \ndemand-based short procurement courses to support training needs, will be prepared and \ndelivered to respond to requests from countries dealing with complex procurement issues and \nwith fundamental constraints on understanding and contract project management processes. \nProcurement  capacity  assessment  initiatives  will  also  be  aimed  at  executing  agencies  in \nselected countries during loan processing. \n \n11.  All of the training content developed and delivered under the regional TA will be aligned \nwith other ongoing training initiatives led by COSO and regional departments. The TA support \n                                                \n6  The TA complements ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Developing Procurement Capacity for Improved \nProcurement Outcomes. Manila, which (i) aims to catalyze reform efforts in the government procurement function, \nand (ii) is a long term capacity development intervention at policy level. The TA \u2018Enhancing Capacity for Effective \nImplementation\u2019 aims at building the capacity of EAs staff on overall project implementation in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines. It is therefore a short/medium term capacity development intervention at project level. \n ", "  3 \nwill build capacity of less-experienced executing agencies currently or about to be involved in \nimplementing ADB projects. The implementation experiences of different DMCs will also be \nshared through learning workshops and seminars. Emphasis will also be given to contract \nadministration  training,  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Internationale  Des  Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils  (International \nFederation  of  Consulting  Engineers)  contract  management,  and  training  of  trainers,  as \nappropriate. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. COSO\u2019s portfolio management unit will be \nresponsible for implementing the TA. Individual consultants will be hired to help prepare and, if \nappropriate, deliver the new courses. All consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The \neffectiveness of the program will be measured from the feedback of the participants. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s regional departments and resident missions will be the main channels used to \nengage  with  the  executing  agencies.7 A  selection  criterion  will  be  set  up  and  applied  in \nconsultation with the regional departments. A range of new tools and resources will be used to \nsupport the capacity development needs of the DMC. Staff of executing agencies and resident \nmissions  will  gain  knowledge  and  skills  on  project  implementation,  especially  related  to \nprocurement of goods, works, and services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n15.  The regional TA will be completed by 15 December 2014 (24 months). The TA will \nrequire 5 person-months of international consulting services and a total of 30 person-months of \nnational consulting services (Appendix 3). Procurement specialists in COSO, and staff from \nregional departments and resident missions will provide support to TA implementation. This will \ninclude taking an active part in facilitating the trainings and supervising the training content \nupdates where possible. ADB staff from COSO, regional departments, and resident missions, in \naddition to other resource speakers, as needed, will provide support to arrange and deliver the \ntraining. ADB\u2019s resident missions will assist in coordinating logistical arrangements. \n \n16.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.
