INTRODUCTION \n1.  While developing Asia has benefitted significantly from export-led growth, continuing \nuncertainty  over  the  economic  performance  of  industrial  countries  highlights  the  risk  of \noverdependence on external demand.  Many of the developing member countries (DMCs) of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) are considering key policy options to rebalance their growth by \nincreasing  demand  from  domestic  sources.  One  way  to  achieve  a  better  balance  is  to \nstrengthen the services sector.1 This requires raising productivity and enhancing competition \nwithin the sector and removing policy distortions that favor manufacturing over services.  \n \n2.  One of the strategic priorities for research in 2009\u20132011 identified by the Technical \nAssistance Strategic Forum 2008 was the promotion of inclusive growth.2 This research and \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) will address this strategic priority by analyzing the part \nplayed by the services sector in the region\u2019s economies and drawing policy lessons from in-\ndepth studies that can be used to enhance the sector\u2019s productivity and expand its role in \ngrowth  and  job  creation.  By  helping  DMCs  develop  the  sector  and  the  economic  and \nemployment opportunities it offers, the TA can make an important contribution to the inclusive \ngrowth agenda of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The development, growth, and productivity of the region\u2019s services sector are hampered \nby structural distortions and impediments. These include excessive regulation, government \ndomination of some service industries, and high barriers to trade.5  Despite these impediments, \nthe contribution of services to growth often tends to be high where industrialization has been \nslow. Examples include the Philippines and South Asia.6  In 2005\u20132010, the services sector in \nthe  Philippines  contributed  3.1  percentage  points  to  the  country\u2019s  average  annual  gross \ndomestic product growth of 4.9% , compared with the 1.6 percentage points added by the \nindustry sector. In Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, the corresponding contributions \nof the services sector to growth were about 3\u20136 percentage points to these countries\u2019 average \ngross  domestic  product  growth  that  ranges  between  5%  and  9%,  compared  with  1\u20132 \npercentage points from the industry sector. Reducing or removing distortions and impediments \nwould increase this already dominant contribution to economic growth and job creation in these \nDMCs and throughout the region.  \n \n4.  Developing Asia's remarkable economic success has been driven by export-oriented \nindustrialization.  Governments  have  focused  their  efforts,  policies,  and  fiscal  and  other \nincentives on promotion of export-oriented manufacturing. At the same time, there is a clear \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009. Asian Development Outlook 2009\u2014Rebalancing Asia\u2019s Growth.

As manufacturing productivity has increased, the services sector\u2019s demand for labor has \ndeclined. Whether it can provide enough jobs for the growing numbers of workers available has \nbecome a key question for the region\u2019s middle-income economies. With a few exceptions, labor \nproductivity and wages are generally low in the services sector. It absorbs most of the labor \nreleased  by  the  agricultural  sector  but  provides  most  of  these  workers  with  informal,  low \nproductivity jobs that offer no formal social protection.7 In addition, groups with a vested interest \nin blocking change stand in the way of reform in a wide range of service industries.  \n \n6.  The services sectors of DMC economies vary widely and the potential exists for them to \nlearn from one another\u2019s successes. For example, services form a much greater share of overall \noutput in India than they do in such other middle-income economies as Indonesia and Thailand. \nThe growth of India\u2019s services sector and those of other South Asian countries has been \npropelled by the vast opportunities offered by the global services revolution.8 Their experience \nprovides a key lesson: while excessive domestic and international trade barriers can severely \nlimit the development of the services sector, liberalization can accelerate its growth.  \n \n7.  The  studies  to  be  undertaken  through  this  TA  will  add  importantly  to  the  existing \nliterature on the subject by exploring in depth both the barriers to services sector development \nacross the region and policy options to overcome them. One critical barrier is the protection of \ncertain service subsectors. The TA will study this obstacle and examine how the sector can be \nliberalized domestically and be made more open to international trade so it can contribute more \nto  the  region\u2019s  economic  growth.  It  will  identify  the  benefits  and  costs  of  domestic  and \ninternational liberalization\u2014information that will be important in promoting sector reforms in \neconomies across the region. More closely that has been done before, the TA studies will also \nexamine how services sector development can create good jobs for the region\u2019s growing labor \nforce and thereby reduce poverty and generate inclusive growth in ADB\u2019s DMCs.9 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced productivity in the services sector and a greater \nrole for it in the region\u2019s growth process. The outcomes will be improved understanding of the \nservices sector by DMC policymakers and the general public through the lessons provided by \nthe TA about the sector\u2019s status, main structural features, main weaknesses, and the strategic \ndirections and reforms that should be followed to strengthen it.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The main output of the TA will be a comprehensive book that will cover the following: (i) \nanalysis of the role of services in making growth more inclusive, (ii) analysis of the constraints to \n                                                 \n7  A.T.M.N Amin. 2002.

The specific contents of the book are:  \n \n(i)  Overview  of  the  region\u2019s  services  sectors,  including  regionwide  issues, \nchallenges, and opportunities. This may include case studies of specific service \nindustries\u2014India\u2019s business process outsourcing sector, for example. \n(ii)  Four regionwide studies of services sectors in the DMCs, examining, for example, \nthe importance of services in DMC gross domestic product and employment \ncompared with experiences in advanced countries.   \n(iii)  In-depth analysis in five individual DMCs to identify the primary obstacles to the \ngrowth and development of their services sectors and to facilitate comparisons \nbetween  countries.  This  may  also  include  case  studies  of  specific  service \nindustries. The countries will be the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, \nthe Republic of Korea, and the Philippines. The TA may also cover one country \nfrom Central Asia (i.e., Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan). \n(iv)  Concrete policy options for strengthening services sectors in the DMCs drawn \nfrom the findings of the research.  \n(v)  Policy lessons from country-specific studies on services sector development.  \n \n10.  Research papers that will be produced under the TA may also serve as background \nmaterial for a possible theme chapter on the services sector in ADB\u2019s Asian Development \nOutlook.  Electronic  or  printed  material  presenting  concise  widely  applicable  lessons  or \nrecommendations based on the findings of the TA studies will also be produced for the widest \npossible audience. \n \n11.  The TA will fund the conduct of workshops and conferences. In the initial workshop, the \nMacroeconomics and Finance Research Division (ERMF) of ADB Economics and Research \nDepartment,  together  with  the  consultants  and  researchers,  will  deliberate  on  a  common \nframework of analysis, especially for the individual country studies. Additional workshops and \nconferences will be held to discuss the findings of the studies and help refine the final output. \nERMF will participate in academic conferences organized by reputable international institutions \nto disseminate the findings of the TA. The timing of such intermediate outputs as research \nseminars and workshops and for dissemination activities will depend on the project\u2019s overall \nprogress. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by \nADB. Appendix 2 shows the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented by the ERMF. The TA is \nexpected to be completed in 24 months from November 2011 to October 2013. \n \n14.   ADB will engage a consulting firm through consultants\u2019 qualifications selection to work \nwith  ADB  staff  and  other  consultants  on  the  research  papers.  The  firm  will  contribute  to \ndetermining the strategic direction and the technical scope of the research papers, oversee the \nquality and timely delivery of the research papers, and ensure that they are widely disseminated. \nA total of 7 person-months of international consulting services will be required from the selected \n ", "4  \nfirm, comprising 2.5 person-months from one lead economist and 4.5 person-months from three \nsenior economists.  \n \n15.

Resource persons will be hired for approximately 2 person-months to \nreview the papers, provide comments, and serve as discussants in the workshops. The TA will \nalso  engage  the  services  of  an economics  editor  for  2  person-months  to  ensure  that  the \npublication to be produced is of high quality. The TA will also require 6 person-months of \nservices from 3 national consultants: 2-person months for assistance in the preparation of \nresearch studies and in organizing workshops and related activities, 2 person-months from a \nmanuscript editor to ensure a quality publication that adheres to ADB style, usage, and format, \nand 2 person-months from a graphic designer to prepare the book for publication.  Individual \nconsultants will be hired using the individual consultant system.  An outline of the terms of \nreference of consultants and resource persons is in Appendix 3. \n \n16.   The consulting firm, individual consultants, and resource persons will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.

Consulting Firm for Regionwide Studies (7 person-months) \n \n1.  The consulting firm will work on four research papers on the services sector from the \nperspective of the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nas a whole. The four specific regionwide topics will be determined in close consultation between \nADB and the consulting firm. For example, one paper may provide an overview of the current \nstate of service industries in the region and the major obstacles to its growth and development. \nAnother paper may explore the issue of how a stronger services sector can contribute to job \ncreation and more inclusive growth. Yet another paper may be a case study of a particular \nservice industry\u2014e.g., financial services\u2014in the DMCs. These studies will become part of a \ncollective volume on the services sector. The consulting firm should be a well-known and \nreputable international economic research institute.  It will provide the consultancy services of a \nminimum of four experts (a lead economist and three senior economists) for the technical \nassistance (TA). They should be recognized as experts in services sector research.  \n \n2.  Lead  economist  (international,  2.5  person-months).  This  expert  will  be  an \ninternationally well-established economist with expertise on services research. The consultant \nwill preferably have sufficient experience in similar assignments that involved the preparation \nand coordination of research products and work with international financial institutions. The \nconsultant will \n \n(i)  jointly  supervise  the  preparation  of  the  research  papers  with  the  ADB  team \nleader,  review  the  other  background  papers,  and  provide  comments  on  the \npapers; \n(ii)  provide inputs to the overall project report, including concrete suggestions on \nactivities, structures, and outputs; \n(iii)  submit a proposed outline of the research paper on one of the agreed topics; \n(iv)  provide a comprehensive literature review; \n(v)  perform rigorous, data-based empirical analysis and write a research paper that \nclearly identifies the link between services sector development and inclusive \ngrowth, compares the sector experiences in the DMCs with those of advanced \neconomies, and recommends concrete and specific policy options for developing \na stronger and more efficient services sector that will make a major contribution \nto inclusive growth; \n(vi)  present the paper at the midterm and finalization conference; \n(vii)  incorporate the comments from the midterm and finalization conference in the \npaper; \n(viii)  submit a final report; \n(ix)  ensure the coherence of the team from the firm and the timely delivery of outputs \nby team members; \n(x)  maintain  effective  communication  with  the  ADB  team  leader  and  lead \ncoordination between the firm\u2019s economists and the economics editor to ensure \nthe overall quality and analytical consistency of the collective volume publication; \n(xi)  co-edit with the ADB team leader the collected volume on the DMCs\u2019 services \nsector; and  \n(xii)  perform other related tasks as reasonably requested by ADB. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n3.  Senior  economists  (international,  3,  4.5  person-months).  These  experts  will  be \ninternationally well-established economists with expertise on services research. Acting jointly \nwith a team of experts and ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department, each consultant will \n \n(i)  submit a proposed outline of the research paper  on one of the agreed topics; \n(ii)  provide a comprehensive literature review; \n(iii)  perform rigorous, data-based empirical analysis and write a research paper that \nclearly identifies the link between services sector development and inclusive \ngrowth, compares the sector experiences in the DMCs with those of advanced \neconomies, and recommends concrete and specific policy options for developing \na stronger and more efficient services sector which will make a major contribution \nto inclusive growth; \n(iv)  present the paper at the midterm and finalization conference; \n(v)  incorporate the comments from the midterm and finalization conference in the \npaper; \n(vi)  submit a final report; and \n(vii)  maintain effective communication with the other economists and the ADB team \nleader  and  cooperate  with  the  lead  economist  and  the  economics  editor  to \nensure the overall quality and analytical consistency of the collective volume \npublication. \n \nB.  Consultants for Country Studies (international, 5, 6 person-months)  \n \n4.  The consultants will prepare individual country studies of the services sectors of the \nPeople's Republic of China, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and the Philippines. In the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, the share of services in the economy is significantly lower than in \nother economies at similar income and development levels. India has emerged as a major \nglobal  exporter  of  information  technology-enabled  services  such  as  business  process \noutsourcing so, to a lesser extent, has the Philippines. Large potential exists for the growth of \nthe services sector in Indonesia, where domestic demand plays a major role in growth. In the \ncase of the Republic of Korea, the government is promoting the services sector as a new engine \nof  growth  and  economic  dynamism  although  the  sector\u2019s  productivity  lags  that  of  the \nmanufacturing  sector.  Depending  on  the  budget  and  data  availability,  one  international \nconsultant may also be hired for a country study from Central and West Asia. Each international \nconsultant should be an economist with proven knowledge of and extensive work experience on \nservice industries. As a minimum qualification, the international consultants who will handle the \ncountry  studies  should  have  a  master\u2019s  degree  or  the  equivalent  of  7  years  of  relevant \nprofessional experience. They should have thorough knowledge of the services sector in their \nassigned country. Each expert will be under the guidance of the TA supervising unit officer and \nwill have several responsibilities:  \n \n(i)   Provide a comprehensive, in-depth overview of the main structural features of the \ncountry's services sector, including qualitative description and quantitative data. \nOne example of the information required is the size and composition of the \ncountry\u2019s services sector. Others are the size and composition of the country\u2019s \ntrade in services and identification of its main trading partners in services trade. \n(ii)  Perform rigorous, data-based empirical analysis of the country\u2019s services sector. \nThis should include, for example, measuring labor productivity in services and \ncomparing it with labor productivity in manufacturing. \n(iii)  Identify  the  main  structural  and  policy-induced  barriers  to  the  growth  and \ndevelopment of the services sector, as well as barriers to higher productivity in \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n \nthe  sector,  including  barriers  to  trade  in  services.  These  barriers  should  be \nranked in terms of their relative significance. \n(iv)  Using  the  findings  from  the  research  in  activities  i\u2013iii,  recommend  concrete, \nspecific  policy  options  for  developing  a  stronger  and  more  efficient  services \nsector that will make a major contribution to inclusive growth.  \n(v )  Write a policy-oriented research paper that incorporates the work and findings of \nactivities i\u2013iv. The research paper will become a chapter in the main final output \nof the TA\u2014a comprehensive, policy-relevant, high-quality book on the services \nsector in ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n \n5.  The  consultants  will  present  the  preliminary  drafts  of  their  papers  at  the  inception \nworkshop and the quasi final drafts of their papers to the closing workshop. The consultants will \nincorporate the comments from that workshop in revising their papers before submitting their \nfinal drafts to the supervising unit officer. \n \nC.  Resource Persons (international, approximately 2 person-months) \n  \n6.  Resource persons with background as policy makers and/or experts will be engaged to \nreview the draft chapters and to participate as discussants in the workshops.  \n \nD.  Economics Editor (international, 2 person-months) \n \n7.  The economics editor will review and edit drafts and manuscripts to ensure coherence, \nsound economic arguments, and the highest publication standards.
