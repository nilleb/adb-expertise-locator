During the 2007 Country Programming Midterm Review Mission, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to support preparing national guidelines for eco-compensation and a \nframework for soil pollution management. This was included in the 2008 pipeline as a firm TA \nproject.1 In October 2008, an ADB mission visited the PRC and reached an understanding with \nthe  Government  on  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2006\u20132010) emphasizes the need to build a \nresource-efficient and environment-friendly society. Environmental challenges in the PRC are \ndiverse and growing, including pollution problems adversely affecting water, air, and soil. As a \nresult, ecosystems of major river basins in various regions are severely threatened and the \nincreasing  soil  contamination  is  threatening  public  health.  The  FYP  stressed  that  eco-\ncompensation mechanisms, also known as payment for environmental services (PES), should be \nestablished. The Government has already gained some experience with the establishment of \nsuch financial instruments,2 and the lessons in preparing these mechanisms have demonstrated \nthe urgent need for developing specific national guidelines.  \n \n3.  The Government has made extraordinary efforts in driving some of the largest public \npayment schemes for ecosystem services in the world. However, given concerns about the \neffectiveness and financial sustainability of these efforts, as well as the establishment of equitable \nstandards and appropriate guidelines, policy makers are very keen to seek solutions to improve \nthese programs, to explore and develop other market-based tools and regulatory innovations, and \nto develop equitable standards and appropriate guidelines to address the PRC\u2019s environmental \nand development challenges in a better way.  \n \n4.  In accordance with the FYP, the Government is also committed to addressing increasing \nconcerns regarding soil pollution and the associated risks to food quality and public health. The \nGovernment recently established a division in MEP to deal with soil pollution management, and \nissued a regulation that makes it possible to prosecute and to hold as liable parties responsible \nfor  environmental  contamination.  The  Government  is  currently  conducting  a  nationwide  soil \npollution survey, which would lead to priority actions to clean up and control the contaminated \nsoils. Up to October 2007, the analysis and tests of 30,590 soil samples in provinces and \nautonomous regions were completed, and a management information system was established. \nHowever, the current legal and policy framework in the PRC is not effective to manage or further \nprevent soil contamination. Urgent support for revising such a framework has been requested \nfrom ADB. \n \n5.  Strengthening  ecological  conservation  and  pollution  management  is  a  core  area  of \noperations of ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)3 to \u201cpromote \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth\u201d.  The  TA  will  assist  in  mainstreaming  environmental \nconsiderations  into  the  PRC\u2019s  policies  and  investment  programs;  and  strengthen  the  legal, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 October 2008. \n2  A large number of case studies on payment for ecological services in river basins has been published recently, \nincluding for the PRC. These include, for example, Elsevier. 2008. Payments for Environmental Services in \nDeveloping and Developed Countries. Ecological Economics. Volume 65, Issue 4, pages 663\u2013852, and various \nreports of the World Bank Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) Program China: Addressing Water Scarcity- \nFrom Analysis to Action. Available: http://go.worldbank.org/XDPEUS5OQ0 (accessed on 26 November 2008). \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "2   \nregulatory,  and  enforcement  capacities  of  the  government  agencies.  Since  1994,  ADB  has \nprovided several TA projects to support legal and regulatory reforms on environmental and \nnatural  resources  management.4  These  demonstrated  to  be  instrumental  in  mainstreaming \nconservation and sustainable development into the PRC\u2019s policy and regulatory framework. The \nproposed TA will build on the lessons learned and experiences gained, and will be closely \ncoordinated with ongoing TA projects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The proposed TA will contribute to improved environmental management and sustainable \ndevelopment. Specifically, the TA will strengthen the PRC\u2019s policy and regulatory framework, and \nits institutional capacity to implement PES in river basins and manage contaminated soils. To \nattain the expected impact, two components have been identified: (i) the preparation of draft \nnational guidelines for PES in river basins, and (ii) the preparation of a draft framework for soil \npollution management. Both documents will be submitted to MEP (July 2010) for issuance. These \ncomponents will contribute to the transition to sustainable agriculture and natural resources \nmanagement by (i) improving sector governance through helping improve policies, legislation and \nthe  regulatory  environment,  market-based  incentives,  and  institutional  arrangements  and \ncoordination;  and  (ii)  encouraging  public  participation  and  private  sector  involvement.  The \nproposed TA will indirectly help reduce poverty through supporting the introduction of PES in river \nbasins and strengthening soil contamination management. Through PES schemes, economic \nincentives are created for a more efficient and sustainable use of ecosystem services. Those who \nare  protecting  and  sustainably  managing  ecological  and  environmental  resources  will  be \ncompensated for their contribution in maintaining these services. Improved soil contamination \nmanagement will generally improve the quality and value of agriculture products. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Component 1: National Guidelines for Eco-Compensation in River Basins. The TA \nwill  facilitate  the  introduction  of  market-based  PES  mechanisms  (component  1)  to  translate \nexternal non-market-based values of the environment into real financial incentives for providers of \nsuch services. Although various local experiments in protecting and paying for ecological services \nare  promising,  additional  guidelines  are  needed  to  provide  necessary  guidance  for  further \ndevelopment of similar instruments throughout the PRC.  \n \n8.  The specific outputs envisaged under the component 1 include: \n \n(i)  an updated overview of methodologies for PES including (a) a report on river basin \nrelated  PES  experiences  in  the  PRC  and  other  countries,  and  (b)  practical \nrecommendations for methodologies to adopt PES systems in the PRC;  \n                                                 \n4  For example, ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Support for Environmental \nLegislation. Manila (TA 4553-PRC, approved on 23 December) is building on province level work, conducting a \ncomprehensive review of the existing legislative framework for environmental protection, in particular in relation to \nnature reserve zones and protection of the soil. A framework for legislation on nature reserves and sustainable soils \ndrawing on international good practices is being prepared, along with legislative plans and procedures. ADB. 2007. \nTechnical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for National Strategies for Environmental Management and \nEnergy Conservation. Manila (TA 4987-PRC, approved on 13 November) is supporting the Government to develop \nthe TA will support the PRC\u2019s development of the macro environmental strategy and the national strategy for \nsustainable energy crops development. Under ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Poverty and Environment \nProgram. Manila (TA 6150-REG, approved on 16 December), ADB provided support for assessing soil contaminated \nsites and conducted cost-effective remediation of contaminated sites on a pilot scale in India (Polluted Place in \nIndia). This project was successfully implemented by the Black Smith Institute (BSI, www.blacksmithinstitute.org) in \nclose cooperation with the Government of India, currently replicating the project using World Bank finance on a large \nscale. ", "            3\n(ii)  supporting  case  studies,  demonstrating  the  application  of  developed  PES \nmethodologies in two river basins, to assess the actual impacts, identifying existing \ntechnical difficulties, and recommending measures for further replication; 5  \n(iii)  draft national guidelines for PES in watersheds including (a) identification of the \nobjectives  and  scope  for  ecological  compensation  in  typical  river  basins; \n(b) identification of rights and responsibilities among the stakeholders involved; \n(c) recommendation  of  \u201cbest  practices\u201d  and  standards  for  various  types  of \necological compensation; (d) implementation arrangements and procedures; and \n(e) a management, monitoring, and evaluation system; and \n(iv)  recommendations for necessary adjustments in financial and tax systems as well \nas regulatory frameworks. \n \n9.  An international conference will be organized after 6 months to share and benefit from \ninternational experiences and development, and to provide guidance for the preparation of the \nnational guidelines. The findings of the TA will be published in Chinese and English language and \nmade available online. The draft national environmental guidelines for PES systems in river \nbasins will be approved by the steering committee and submitted for issuance by MEP. \n \n10.  Component 2: Framework for Soil Pollution Management. The TA will also assist the \nGovernment  in  preparing  strategic  options  covering  2008\u20132020  for  developing  a  revised \nframework  for  the  management  of  contaminated  soils  (component  2).  In  anticipation  of  the \ncompletion of the national soil contamination survey, the Government still needs to (i) develop \npractical plans on how to prioritize and proceed with possible cleanup or control of contaminated \nsites; (ii) establish standards and procedures to be applied; and (iii) assess the institutional, legal, \nand cost implications.  \n \n11.  The specific outputs under component 2 will include: \n \n(i)  an overview of international experiences relevant to the PRC including (a) an \nassessment  of  the  feasibility  of  applying  existing  national  and  international \ntechnological options for the remediation and management of contaminated sites \nin  the  PRC;  and  (b)  a  review  of  existing  technologies  currently  available  for \ncontainment,  remediation,  cleanup,  disposal,  and  destruction  of  contaminated \nmaterials and wastes found in contaminated sites; \n(ii)  an  assessment  of  existing  legal  frameworks  including  a  review  of  (a)  all  key \nregulations and laws at the provincial and national levels, (b) existing institutional \nstructures  at  the  provincial  and  national  levels  for  the  management  of \nenvironmental pollution, (c) legal implications resulting from public investments in \ncontaminated  sites,  (d)  potential  long-term  liabilities  of  parties  involved  in \nenvironmental cleanup, and (e) regulations that define risk thresholds caused by \nexposure to hazards and that restrict land use; \n(iii)  recommendations for cleanup standards specifying (a) the definition of categories \nof sites for which residual levels of contamination may be allowed after cleanup, \ngiven location and potential for population exposure, intended use of the site, and \ncost-effectiveness of increasing levels of cleanup; (b) establishment of minimum \nacceptable levels of cleanup required for different types of sites; (c) definition of \nrisk thresholds acceptable for different types of sites; and (d) establishment of \nlong-term monitoring needs for the different type of sites; \n(iv)  an  evaluation  of  potential  financing  mechanisms  for  contaminated  site \nmanagement  including  an  assessment  of  (a)  provincial  and  national  budget \nallocations; (b) existing provincial and national funds for remediation; (c) tariffs on \nimporting, producing, using, or trading of goods; (d) partnerships between the \n                                                 \n5  The two case studies will be selected during the inception phase in consultation with the consultants. \n ", "4   \nprivate and public sectors; (e) institutional requirements for the establishment of a \nremediation  fund  with  possible  international  cooperation;  (f)  market-based \nincentives to private investment; (g) financial alternatives that have been practiced \nin other countries; and (h) regulatory measures to ensure that resources from the \nfunding mechanism are used only for purposes related to prevention and cleanup \nof contaminated sites;  \n(v)  a system to prioritize contaminated sites incorporating criteria to (a) determine the \nlevel of risk posed by a contaminated site, (b) assess the relative importance of \nsocial and economical aspects associated with each site, (c) account for potential \ncosts of remediation, and (d) rank sites from the national inventory (once this is \nestablished); and \n(vi)  recommendations  for  necessary  adjustments  of  financial,  legislative,  and \nregulatory frameworks. \n \n12.  An international study tour will be organized for about four to six government staff to \nfamiliarize  themselves  with  foreign  experiences  in  the  management  of  contaminated  soil \nmanagement, and obtain further guidance for the development of the proposed framework. The \nparticipants  will  prepare  a  training  report  and  present  their  findings  during  one  of  the  TA \nworkshops. The findings of the different activities will be published in Chinese and English \nlanguage and made available online. The draft national framework for soil pollution management \nwill be approved by the steering committee and submitted for issuance by MEP. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance \n$400,000 equivalent from its TA funding program. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility6 will provide cofinancing of $400,000 equivalent on a grant basis,7 \nto  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  remaining  $400,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services including the provision of necessary \ndata, office space, counterpart staff, local transportation, and other administrative support. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  TA  implementation  will  take  18  months  from  February  2009  to  July  2010.  The  TA \ncompletion date will be 31 July 2010 and the TA closing date will be 31 October 2010. MEP will \nbe  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  TA.  The  Government  and  ADB  agree  to  delegate \nconsultant recruitment and supervision under this TA to the EA.8 The terms and conditions of the \nTechnical Assistance Framework Agreement executed between the Government and ADB dated \n23 December 1996 apply to this TA, except that consultant selection and supervision for firms \nand individuals under this TA will be undertaken by MEP on behalf of the Government. The \nconsultants will be entitled to the privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided under such \nTechnical Assistance Framework Agreement.  \n \n15.  An interagency steering committee will be established in MEP, chaired by the director \ngeneral  of  the  Department  of  Nature  and  Ecology  Conservation,  and  senior  officials  of  the \ndepartments for international cooperation, pollution control, and Foreign Economic Cooperation \nOffice (FECO). For component 1, the TA implementation will be closely coordinated with the \n                                                 \n6  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. Water Financing Partnership Facility funds \nwill be front-loaded at the contract commitment level. \n7  The facility will finance component 1: national guidelines for eco-compensation in river basins.  \n8  A capacity assessment of MEP conducted by ADB in June 2008 showed that it has the capacity to implement the \ndelegated authority. However, to have the TA implemented efficiently, it was agreed that two full-time staff with \nsector knowledge and an experienced interpreter will be assigned to process, implement, and administer the \nproposed TA.  ", "            5\nNational People\u2019s Congress and key entities such as the National Development and Reform \nCommission (NDRC), Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Land Resource \nManagement, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Water Resources, and River Basin \nManagement  Committee.  For  component  2,  close  coordination  between  NDRC,  Ministry  of \nFinance, and Ministry of Land Resource Management is necessary.  \n \n16.  A TA management office (TMO) will be established in FECO to carry out day-to-day TA \noperations. The director, Project Management Division 1 of FECO, will serve as the executive \ndirector of the TMO. The director of the General Affairs Division of MEP will be responsible for \nimplementation of component 1 and the director of MEP\u2019s Soil Environmental Division9 will be \nresponsible for implementation of component 2. FECO, through the TMO, will execute the TA \nimplementation and be responsible for day-to-day operational matters among ADB, consultants, \nand related government agencies. FECO will furnish biannual progress reports to ADB during the \nimplementation period of the TA and will furnish to ADB a TA completion report within 3 months \nof the TA completion date. \n \n17.  A team of international and national consultants will be recruited for each of the two \ncomponents, with a total of 8 international and 62 national person-months. The consultants for \ncomponents 1 and 2 will be engaged by the EA through two firms, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using quality- and \ncost-based selection criteria (with a quality/cost weighing rate of 80:20) and simplified technical \nproposal procedure. Equipment to be purchased under the TA will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and will be handed \nover to MEP upon completion of the TA. The procurement plan in Appendix 3. The outline terms \nof reference of the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  The TA grant proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Diagrams showing the document and fund flow are given \nin Supplementary Appendix A. For withdrawal of the TA grant funds, MEP will submit to ADB the \noriginal withdrawal application, signed by authorized representative, summary sheet, and copies \nof supporting documents. The direct payment and reimbursement procedures mainly will be used \nfor withdrawal of TA funds. MEP will maintain separate accounts for the TA grant and have these \naccounts audited on an annual basis by an external auditor acceptable to ADB. Within 6 months \nafter the completion of the fiscal year, the EA will submit to ADB an audit report. MEP will retain \nthe original supporting documents for expenditures under the TA for 5 years after completion of \nthe TA and make these documents available to the ADB review mission upon request within the \nindicated TA retention period. MEP has experience in implementing ADB TA projects and has an \nadequate accounting and records keeping system in place.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant \nbasis, to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing National Guidelines for \nEco-Compensation in River Basins and a Framework for Soil Pollution Management, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n9  MEP is considering a reorganization of the ministry. As a result, MEP informed ADB that component 2 may finally be \nassigned to a new division. MEP will inform ADB if relevant changes in its organizational structure occur.  \n ", "6        Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   And Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved  \u2022  Goal and targets  MEP annual  The Government is \nenvironmental  specified in the  environmental statistics  committed to implementing \nmanagement and  Government\u2019s 11th FYP  report  the environmental strategy \nsustainable  (2006\u20132010) for     \ndevelopment  environmental protection  The Government\u2019s capacity \nare met by 2010   to create the right \n  incentives to implement \nPES systems \n \nRisks \nAgencies related to \ncontaminated soil \nmanagement are reluctant \nto cooperate and \ncoordinate \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened the  Draft national environmental  Project document reviews   The steering committee \nPRC\u2019s policy and  guidelines for PES systems    ensures that the guidelines \nregulatory framework,  in river basins are submitted  Annual report of MEP  and framework are \nand its institutional  for issuance by MEP    completed with adequate \ncapacity to implement  (July 2010)  Annual reports from MOF,  consultation and quality \nPES in river basins    NDRC, MOLR, and MOA  control \nand manage  Draft framework for     \ncontaminated soils  contaminated sites  MOA, MOLR, and \nmanagement is finalized and  concerned ministries have \nsubmitted for issuance by  a strong commitment and \nMEP (July 2010)  willingness to cooperate  \n   \nOutputs      Assumptions \nReports and  Final technical reports  Minutes of meetings of the  High-level authorities within \nrecommendations for  published in Chinese and  steering committee   MEP consider TA \nthe guidelines for the  English language and made    implementation a priority \nintroduction of PES  available online   TA review missions and   \nand national    reports  The steering committee \nframework for soil  The steering committee    provides timely advice and \npollution  endorses the guidelines for  Reports and documents  guidance \nmanagement  the introduction of PES in  related to the PES   \nriver basins and national  guidelines and discussions \nframework for remediation  at the two national \nand management of  workshops \ncontaminated soils by   \nJuly 2010 \n \n ", "        Appendix 1            7\nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   And Risks  \n    Reports/documents related  Consensus is reached \nto the national framework  through consultations \nfor remediation and  among key stakeholders \nmanagement of polluted \nsoils and discussion at the \ntwo national workshops \n \nConsultants\u2019 reports \n \nDialogue with MEP, MOF, \nand NDRC \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.
