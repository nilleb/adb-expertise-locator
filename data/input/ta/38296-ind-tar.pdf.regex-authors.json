The ongoing Multisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir1 \nis the first sector loan for an urban project in India. During loan formulation, it was recognized \nthat because of growing population pressures, the existing urban infrastructure required major \nexpansion, above and beyond the rehabilitation provided in the ongoing project. The state of \nJammu  and  Kashmir  (J&K),  through  the  Government  of  India,  requested  that  these \nimprovements  be  provided  by  a  follow-on  project,  based  on  a  comprehensive  long-term \ndevelopment strategy for the two principal cities of Jammu and Srinagar. A technical assistance \n(TA) for preparing the Jammu and Kashmir Urban Sector Investment Program (JKUSIP)2 was \napproved with the loan (footnote 1) and included in the country strategy and program update \n(CSPU)3. The TA consultants were fielded from 16 January 2006 with the intention of having the \nproposed project approved in late 2006. The Economic Reconstruction Agency (ERA) is the \nExecuting Agency for the ongoing project as well as the project preparatory TA.  \n \n2.  Recognizing that start-up delays have been a major cause for concern for urban sector \nprojects, an advisory TA was included in the CSPU for 20054 to support ERA. The TA aims \nspecifically to build capacity in ERA, J&K line departments, and Jammu and Srinagar municipal \ncorporations to implement ongoing and proposed projects and to operate and maintain the new \nfacilities that would be created by the two projects. A TA fact-finding mission visited Jammu and \nSrinagar during 16 to 20 January 2006, and reached an understanding with J&K on the advisory \nTA\u2019s broad objectives. A follow-up mission, combined with a review of the ongoing project, \nvisited  J&K  during  24  to  26  April  2006,  during  which  the  scope,  budget,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA consultants were agreed. The advisory TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The decision by India and J&K to urgently improve key infrastructure facilities in the state \nreflects their determination to improve local living conditions and achieve economic growth to \naddress  some  of  the  consequences  of  the  16  years  of  disturbance  and  the  resultant \ndeterioration of infrastructure. Besides improving physical infrastructure, the projects will also \nimprove governance and build the capacity of state line departments and municipal corporations \nof Jammu and Srinagar. Before the project, J&K had little experience in implementing large and \ncomplex projects. ERA was established as the nodal institution to implement all externally aided \nprojects, and may in time also take on the role of a financial intermediary along the lines of the \nTamil Nadu Urban Development Fund and the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development \nFinance Corporation.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor the Multisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir and Technical Assistance Grant \nfor the Preparation of the Jammu and Kashmir Urban Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (Loan 2151-IND, \nfor $250 million, approved on 21 December 2004).  \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for Preparation of the Jammu and Kashmir Urban Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 4515-IND, with technical assistance to India for a budget of $630,000, supported \nby a $500,000 grant from the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, and an in-kind \ncontribution equivalent to $130,000 from the government of J&K). \n3  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update for India, 2005-2007, Manila.. \n4  The advisory TA was published in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 February 2006. ", "2   \n \n4.  ERA was staffed through secondments from the Public Health Engineering Department, \nUrban Environmental Engineering Department, Public Works Department, and Department of \nFinance.  ERA  is  guided  by  a  steering  committee  consisting  of  the  heads  of  relevant  line \ndepartments and chaired by the state\u2019s chief minister. Senior officers responsible for urban \ninfrastructure,  the  transport  sector,  and  financial  management,  along  with  technical  and \nsupporting staff, have been appointed.  \n \n5.  To achieve the early realization of project benefits, the national Ministry of Finance is \nkeen to ensure that implementation of and disbursements on any ADB-financed project start \nimmediately after loan effectivity. In response, ADB is providing \u201cbridging\u201d or transitional TA to \nhelp executing agencies in the first year of implementation. To help ERA with implementation \nand appraisal of new subprojects, ADB provided transitional assistance to ERA from loan \napproval  to  effectivity.  This  helped  familiarize  ERA  staff  members  with  ADB  procurement \nprocedures,  appraisal  of  subprojects,  and  safeguard  policy  requirements,  and  generally \nstrengthened ERA\u2019s project management unit (PMU) and project implementation units (PIUs). \nSupport to ERA was continued after loan effectivity by establishing a project support unit (PSU) \nfunded by the ongoing project preparatory TA (footnote 2), which helped the PMU and PIUs \nprepare designs and tender documents for the sample subprojects appraised for the ongoing \nloan. The PSU consists of an experienced ADB staff consultant assisted by a procurement \nconsultant.  ERA  mobilized  its  own  loan-financed  project  management  and  design  and \nsupervision consultants in January 2006. \n \n6.  The assistance provided to ERA has helped reduce start-up delays in the ongoing \nproject, and the experience gained by ERA will help initiate implementation of the follow-on \nJKUSIP. India requires that initial works contracts worth about 20% of the total project cost be \ndesigned, tendered, and ready for award before a loan is made effective. To help ERA attain \nthis level of project preparedness, ERA has requested a $500,000 grant from the \u201cumbrella TA\u201d \n4814-IND: TA Cluster for Project Processing and Capacity Development approved by ADB\u2019s \nBoard in June 2006 to fund the appraisal and detailed engineering of subprojects.  \n \n7.  Over the past year, ERA has gained valuable experience relating to engagement of \nconsultants, planning, design and procurement of works, and preparation and appraisal of \nsubprojects. The construction of major water supply, sewerage, and drainage works, which \ncomprise the bulk of the urban sector investments under the ongoing project, will commence in \nthe third quarter of 2006. As these major contracts get under way, ERA\u2019s capability to manage \nconstruction, control quality, and monitor environmental management plans and resettlement, \nas well as to appraise and design subsequent water supply and drainage works must be \nstrengthened. In addition, to manage the large and complex urban sector subprojects included \nunder the proposed project, ERA will have to be substantially strengthened with new staff \nmembers, who need to be trained.  \n \n8.  ERA  is  also  the  executing  agency  for  urban  infrastructure  projects  in  Jammu  and \nSrinagar, under the recently established Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission \n(JNNURM)5. These works are likely to be as large and as complex as the ongoing ADB-\nfinanced projects and will further challenge ERA\u2019s project implementation abilities.  \n \n                                                 \n5  JNNURM will make $10 billion available to 63 cities, including Srinagar and Jammu, on the basis of a reform \nprogram and comprehensive city development plans to be prepared by candidate cities; for J&K, 90% of the \ninvestment funds will be available as a grant, and the balance as the state\u2019s contribution.  ", "    3\n     \n     \n \n9.  The ongoing project is introducing various urban sector reforms to make operations \nmore efficient, enhance revenue generation, and give J&K more autonomy. The JKUSIP will \nbuild on these initiatives through institutional development and capacity development to improve \nplanning,  budgeting,  accounting,  record  computerization,  and  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) of existing and new urban infrastructure, including establishment of modern financial \nmanagement systems in the municipalities. Such reforms are integral to other ongoing urban \nsector  projects  in  India  financed  by  ADB,  and  to  JNNURM.  ERA  will  need  to  develop  a \nconsensus among a broad range of stakeholders, including elected representatives, officials \nfrom line departments, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and citizens\u2019 groups, on a range \nof  policy  issues  such  as  increased  service  charges  for  water,  sewerage  and  solid  waste \nmanagement, property tax as an important component of municipal finance, urban planning and \nland-use regulations, and arrangements for O&M, including a role for the private sector where \npossible. Lessons from ongoing urban sector projects in India have shown that when planning \nsuch projects, the nodal agency needs to consult extensively with the beneficiary cities and \nother  stakeholders  through  public  awareness  and  community  outreach  programs  and \nestablishment of a grievance procedure. The TA would help ERA develop these programs and \nskills, and guide and support Jammu and Srinagar municipal corporations in improving their \nlocal capabilities.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA continues the capacity-building support for the ongoing loan (footnote 1) and \naims to further strengthen urban project management and sustainable urban development. The \nTA will help mainstream effective and efficient urban sector project implementation, leading to \nsustainable improvements in infrastructure, public health, environmental quality, and quality of \nlife through better access to basic services in the participating communities. The TA outcome \nwill be (i) improved capacity of ERA, Jammu, and Srinagar municipal corporations to plan, \nimplement, manage, and monitor urban sector projects supported by ADB, JNNURM, and state \nbudgets or plans; and (ii) improved implementation and performance of urban sector projects. \nThe specific TA outputs are (i) formulation and operationalization of a project management \nsystem, (ii) continued implementation support to ERA, (iii) capacity building and training, (iv) \nimproved urban planning, engineering designs and contract packaging, (v) development of an \nO&M plan for Jammu and Srinagar, and (vi) improved public awareness.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n11.  Project Management System. Under the TA, a modern project management system \nwill be set up for ERA\u2019s PMU, the project offices in Srinagar and Jammu, and the line agencies\u2019 \nPIUs.  This  will  include  rationalization  of  staff,  internal  procedures,  financial  systems  and \ncontrols,  quality  control,  continual  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  subproject \nidentification  and  appraisal  procedures.  The  procurement  management  system  will  be \ndeveloped keeping in view ADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures. To ensure that the system is \nproperly internalized, training and hands-on support through day-to-day interaction on project \nworks will be provided to ERA\u2019s PMU, PIUs, and line agency staff. \n The views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n1m2e.m  berSs,u Bpopaordrt o tf oD iPrercotojersc,t M Imanpalgeemmeenntt,a otri osnta.f fS, auncdh  msauyp bpeo rptr ewliimll inbaer yp irno nvaidtuerde . b y extending the \ncurrent PSU by 1 year, to November 2007, or until the anticipated date of loan effectivity, \nwhichever is earlier, through the TA. The PSU\u2019s terms of reference will remain similar to those \nfor the ongoing project. \n ", "4   \n \n \n13.  Capacity Building and Training. Workshops on good project implementation will be \nconducted by experienced resource people from the TA and PSU, India Resident Mission staff, \nand specialists from other ongoing projects in India, to train ERA\u2019s PMU, PIUs, and line agency \nstaff, as well project consultants and contractors. The practical applications introduced at the \nfocused training sessions will be expanded and put to practical use by ERA\u2019s PMU and PIUs \nthrough the day-to-day hands-on support from the TA and PSU consultants. Similarly, the same \nunits will be trained and supported in developing skills to appraise and conduct due diligence on \nthe new subprojects as they are planned, designed, and tendered. The training may include \nvisits to other ADB-financed projects in India. In addition to project implementation issues, the \ntraining  will  provide  ERA  and  state  line  department  and  municipal  corporation  staff  an \nopportunity to become familiar with O&M requirements and project sustainability aspects. The \nTA will examine the options for sustainable O&M of urban infrastructure, and support the \npreparation of an O&M plan and capacity building of the state and city line agencies responsible \nfor the O&M of existing and new facilities being constructed under the ongoing and proposed \nloans.  \n \n14.  Review of Master Plans and Detailed Engineering Designs. The work of updating \nand refining current master plans for water supply, sewerage, and drainage works being done \nby the project consultants under the ongoing project will take several months to complete, \nthrough the end of 2006. Urban planning and master planning are comparatively new disciplines \nin India, and the TA will bring international good practice and perspective to critical stages of \ndevelopment of these master plans. While the TA will not conduct detailed engineering design \nwork, it will review the detailed engineering and appraisal of subprojects and work packages \nunder the JKUSIP.  \n \n15.  Public  Awareness  and  Participation.  The  TA  will  help  ERA  conduct  effective \nconsultations with project stakeholders, including state officials, municipal staff and elected \nrepresentatives, NGOs, and citizens\u2019 groups.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The  total  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $500,000  equivalent,  of  which  $400,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. J&K will provide \n$100,000 equivalent in kind for office accommodation, counterpart staff support, field transport, \nfacilities for seminars and meetings, and other administrative expenses. Details of the cost \nestimate and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ERA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The ERA chief executive officer will be \nresponsible  for  overall  coordination  with  ADB.  ERA\u2019s  steering  committee  will  review  the \nprogress of the TA every month and guide its activities. TA inputs will be coordinated by the \nlead PSU consultant to be engaged under the TA.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from January to December 2007. The TA \nconsulting services will total 32 person-months (4 international, 28 national), excluding the \ninputs of local institutions to assist with public participation and training. The expertise required \nincludes a municipal engineering specialist and lead PSU consultant (international, 4 person-\nmonths); a project implementation specialist and deputy lead PSU consultant (national, 11 \nperson-months);  a  procurement  and  consultancy  services  specialist  (national,  3  person-", "    5\n     \n     \n \nmonths); a social development specialist (national, 3 person-months); a municipal engineer and \nO&M specialist (national, 6 person-months); and a municipal finance specialist (national, 5 \nperson-months). The lead PSU consultant will be responsible for the professional overview of \ntasks and outputs of all consultants. Through the deputy lead PSU consultant, who will be \nresponsible for coordination and regular reporting, all consultants will report to the lead PSU \nconsultant. The outline terms of reference for each of the positions are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  as  individuals  by  ADB,  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006). Individual consultants, rather than a firm, are \nproposed  for  this  advisory  TA  because  (i)  the  expertise  required  is  not  all  available  from \ndomestic firms, (ii) J&K has security issues, and (iii) advertising for firms has led to poor \nresponse. For the same reasons, the ongoing project preparatory TA (footnote 2) required \nManagement approval to change the consultants from a firm to individuals after the TA was \napproved.  To  ensure  that  expertise  is  available  with  a  proven  track  record  in  municipal \nmanagement and O&M in India, and to field these specialists in a timely manner, ADB will \nrecruit the consultants on an individual basis. The Municipal Engineering Specialist and Lead \nProject  Support  Unit  (PSU)  consultant  and  will  manage  the  input  of  other  consultants  as \nincorporated in the terms of reference.  \n \n20.  The consultants\u2019 reporting requirements will include (i) an inception report within 6 weeks \nof the TA\u2019s start, (ii) monthly progress reports at the end of each month during implementation, \nand (iii) a final report summarizing the TA\u2019s achievements. \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for Strengthening Urban Project Management in Jammu and Kashmir, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6     Appendix 1  \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources /  Assumptions and \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact  ADB-supported projects rated  Aide memoire of ADB  Assumptions: \nImproved infrastructure,  satisfactory or highly  loan and TA review  Government remains \nenvironmental quality,  satisfactory for implementation  missions  committed to efficient \nand citizens\u2019 access to  progress and achievement of    and effective \nbasic services in urban  development objectives    implementation of \nareas of Jammu and    Project completion  ADB-and JNNURM-\nKashmir  The MoUD rates JNNURM  reports  supported urban \nprojects as satisfactory or better    projects  \n  JNNURM project   \nImproved public access and  reports  Counterpart \nsatisfaction with basic urban    government funding \nservices, improved public health  MoUD and state  remains accessible  \nstatus and quality of life in  reports on urban   \nurban areas   sector  Risk \n    Reforms are slow \nImproved quality and coverage  Consultants\u2019 reports, \nof urban infrastructure and  impact assessment, \nservices, improved status of  surveys  \nurban environment    \n  Municipal corporation \nreports and minutes \n \nOutcome  Satisfactory project  Aide memoire of ADB  Assumption \nImproved urban sector  performance as per agreed  loan and TA review  ERA takes full \nplanning and project  implementation schedule, cost  missions  ownership of \nmanagement in Jammu  estimates, quality standards,    developing and \nand Kashmir   and contract award and  Project and TA  maintaining the \n  disbursement projection  performance reports  project management \n    system and using TA \nSatisfactory compliance with  Project completion  outputs \nADB\u2019s guidelines for  reports   \nprocurement, consultants, and    Risks \nsocial and environmental  JNNURM project  Appointment of \nsafeguard requirements  reports  suitable government \n    staff and consultant \nProject framework and  mobilization are \nJNNURM projects based on the  delayed \nupdated master plans   \n  Security issues delay \nproject \nimplementation \n \n \n ", "   \n     Appendix 1       7\n       \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources /  Assumptions and \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \n    Consultants\u2019 reports,    \n  surveys and project   \n  data \n   \nProject support unit \nmonthly reports \n \nERA steering \ncommittee minutes \n \nOutputs   A modern project management  Aide memoire of ADB\u2019s  Assumption  \n1.
