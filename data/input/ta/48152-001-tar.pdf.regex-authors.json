INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  goal  of  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  is  to  assist  Thailand  in \nachieving inclusive and sustainable rapid economic growth, leading to reduced poverty and a \nhigher income status.1 The country partnership strategy is operationalized through four program \nareas:  infrastructure  development,  finance  sector  development,  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment,  and  regional  cooperation  initiatives.  Under  the  finance  sector  development \nprogram area, advancing financial literacy and inclusive finance are priorities. This policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) project was included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry  operations  business  plan  for  Thailand,  2013\u20132015. 2  During  the  2014  country \nprogramming  mission,  the  government  confirmed  that  financial  literacy  remained  high  on \nThailand\u2019s development agenda. The Bank of Thailand (BOT) confirmed its strong commitment \nto develop a financial literacy assessment system and strengthen the framework for financial \nliteracy  programs.  The  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost \nestimates and financing agreements, and terms of reference were agreed during a TA fact-\nfinding mission from 1 to 12 September 2014. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Understanding financial matters from the basics of budgeting to investment planning is \nfundamental for inclusive finance. Many of the problems in the Thai finance sector, including \nrising household debt, inadequate pensions, and poor record-keeping by small and medium-\nsized  enterprises,  can  be  traced  to  a  lack  of  understanding  of  financial  matters.  Surveys \nconducted in 2013 on financial literacy by the BOT in cooperation with the National Statistical \nOffice and by FinScope during a TA project on microfinance found that the level of financial \nliteracy of most of the Thai population is low.4  More than 25 financial literacy programs are \nbeing  implemented  in  Thailand  by  commercial  banks,  specialized  financial  institutions, \nindependent bodies (such as the Stock Exchange of Thailand and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission), civil society organizations, and nongovernment organizations.5  While there is no \nshortage  of  supply  of  financial  education  programs  in  Thailand,  both  the  TA  project  on \nmicrofinance and another TA project, 6 which focused on formal sector workers, found that there \nis little coordination among different programs, no program evaluation or impact assessment, \nand no central strategy for financial education.   \n \n3.  The development of a more inclusive financial system is at risk if users have a poor \nunderstanding of financial products, discipline, and choices. Without sufficient understanding, \npeople may reject the financial services offered, preventing them from benefiting from the use of \na wider range of financial tools. Individuals who lack financial literacy can also be drawn into \nmaking inappropriate choices and being taken advantage of by fraudulent financial schemes.  \n \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2012.

In 2012, the \nBOT opened its Financial Consumer Protection Center, which focuses on the avoidance of \nfraud and the rights and responsibilities of consumers. Most of the complaints received involved \nlack of understanding of financial products. While this is partly a result of clients\u2019 insufficient \nfinancial knowledge, it is mostly because financial institutions do not provide sufficient and \nexplicit information on their products. \n \n5.   International  forums,  such  as  the  Group  of  Twenty  (G20),7 Asia-Pacific  Economic \nCooperation, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, have recognized the importance \nof financial education in achieving financial stability and inclusive development. The High-Level \nPrinciples on National Strategies for Financial Education were developed by the Organisation \nfor  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  International  Network  on  Financial \nEducation, and were endorsed by the G20 leaders and supported by the Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation ministers of finance.8 The High-Level Principles encourage countries to conduct a \nnational measurement of financial literacy based on the OECD Toolkit to assess the needs of \nthe population and determine the main policy issues. The BOT partially adopted the OECD \ntoolkit on measuring financial literacy in its 2013 survey, and found the survey result useful for \ndeveloping  its  nationwide  financial  education  strategy.  The  survey  showed  that  the  Thai \npopulation scored 58.5% for financial literacy compared with an average of 62.3% for the 14 \ncountries  that  participated  in  the  survey  that  year.  Building  on  the  financial  literacy  work \nconducted under the two previous ADB TA projects (footnotes 4 and 6), the BOT would like to \ndevelop a sustainable way to conduct the survey. The survey would (i) evaluate the changes \nover time in the financial literacy behavior and needs of Thai people, thus supporting the \ndevelopment of an evidence-based policy on financial literacy and financial consumer protection; \nand (ii) enable consistent participation in the OECD Measuring Financial Literacy Program so \nthat the survey results can be compared over time and internationally.   \n \n6.  Under ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, ADB will strengthen its support for \nfinancial  education  and  consumer  protection  to  promote  the  development  effectiveness  of \nfinance sector development operations.9 The ADB Independent Evaluation Department special \nevaluation  report  on  Microfinance  Development  Strategy  2000  also  recommended  that  a \ndemand orientation with a greater focus on the clients is needed, particularly in financial literacy \nand consumer protection.10 The TA will contribute to the development of a framework for ADB \nfinancial education support under the Financial Sector Operation Plan.  \n \n \n                                                \n7 The G20 membership comprises the world\u2019s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-\nthirds of the world\u2019s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, and more than 75% of global trade. Its \nmembers are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the European Union, France, \nGermany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, \nSouth Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n8  The High-Level Principles recommended that the development of a national strategy for financial education should \ninvolve appropriate assessment, mapping, consultative and communication processes, and preparatory surveys. \nThe process for the development of a national strategy is important in order to raise the level of awareness at a \nnational level, build trust among various stakeholders, identify the best modalities for coordination, and ensure \nrelevance at the national level. http://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financal-education/ \n9  ADB. 2011.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  will  be  improved  personal  awareness  and  skills  to  manage  financial \ntransactions of the Thai population. The outcome will be clear direction and a better coordinated \nnationwide strategy for financial literacy programs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Output 1: Developing a financial literacy assessment system. The TA will support \nthe  development  of  country-specific  survey  questionnaires  based  on  the  OECD  and \nInternational  Network  on  Financial  Education  Toolkit  to  Measure  Financial  Literacy  and \nFinancial Inclusion. A national survey with a sample size of at least 10,000 will be carried out. \nThe OECD will provide cross-country analysis of the survey data while the TA will provide \ncountry-specific analysis. The demand side of financial literacy in Thailand will be reflected \nthrough the survey result and the analysis of gaps in awareness, understanding, and skills. \nBased on the survey questionnaires developed, the TA will support the development of a web-\nbased questionnaire and data processing system that will be a sustainable tool for the BOT to (i) \nassess the improvement in financial literacy of the Thai population and the changing needs for \nfinancial knowledge, and (ii) evaluate the outcome of financial literacy programs of BOT and \nfinancial institutions over time.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Strengthening the framework for financial literacy programs. The TA will \nhelp to strengthen the supply side of financial knowledge in Thailand through the development \nof creative financial knowledge contents and an improvement in coordination among various \nfinancial literacy programs. Based on the demand analysis in output 1 and the findings and \nrecommendations  of  previous  ADB  support,  the  TA  will  work  with  the  BOT  and  other \nstakeholders through a consultative process to develop strategic directions, key messages, and \na core program for financial education that includes organized financial knowledge content, \ntools, and activity designs. The core program will be rolled out nationwide by the BOT, and \nimplemented by the BOT and members of the Thai Bankers\u2019 Association. The TA will also \nrecommend measures to strengthen financial consumer protection. The BOT will take follow-up \nactions to strengthen consumer protection rules and regulations.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff, office \nspace and supplies for the expert team, land transport for the team, tokens of appreciation for \ninterviewees, a server to host the web-based survey processing system, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The BOT will be the executing agency. Members of the Thai Bankers\u2019 Association will \nalso participate in the TA as the main stakeholders.  \n \n12.  The TA  will  engage  an  international financial  literacy  expert  (2 person-months),  an \ninternational financial  consumer  protection  expert  (1  person-month),  and  a  national  project \n ", "4   \nassistant (3 person-months). The TA will also engage a national firm to carry out the national \nsurvey and develop a web-based survey processing system through a fixed-budget selection \nmethod. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).11 The TA activities, including consultation \nmeetings and workshops, will be implemented from 1 December 2014 to 31 March 2016. The \nBOT will host the web-based survey processing system on its website and will maintain the \nsystem after the TA is closed. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n13.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Thailand for Advancing National Financial Literacy, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n                                                \n11 To reduce the administrative burden, and for economy, efficiency, and value for money, all consulting services \n(except for a national project assistant) under the TA will be engaged on output-based (lump-sum) contracts. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nIndicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved personal  Average financial literacy  BOT survey result,  TA outcomes and \nawareness and skills  score surveyed in 2019 is  which will be available  outputs are successfully \nto manage financial  equal to or higher than  both on OECD and BOT  implemented. \ntransactions of the  OECD average financial  websites \nRisk \nThai population  literacy score of 2019 \n(Baseline 2011: Thailand  Future populist policy \n58.5%, OECD average  that may lead to \n62.3%)  deterioration in financial \n    discipline of Thai \npopulation. \n   \nOutcome      Assumption \nClear direction and a  BOT and TBA adopt a  Public campaigns and  BOT continues to take \nbetter coordinated  mutual public message  financial education  a leading role in \nnationwide strategy  and strategic direction on  programs implemented  financial literacy and \nfor financial literacy  financial literacy by the  by BOT and members of  consumer protection \nprograms  end of 2015 (Baseline: no  TBA  with adequate \ncommon message in  resources. \n2014) \nRisk \nBOT and members of TBA \nCooperation from \nuse the designed financial \norganizations is \nliteracy content and tools \nhalfhearted. \nin their financial education \nprograms in 2016 and \nbeyond (Baseline: no \norganized content and \ncommon tools in 2014) \n   \n   \nOutputs       \n1.
