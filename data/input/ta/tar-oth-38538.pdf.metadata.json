INTRODUCTION \n1.  On  16  January  2001,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  water  policy1  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), following extensive consultations with stakeholders over several years. \nBesides promoting national water sector reforms, integrated water resources management, and better \nwater services for the poor, the policy commits ADB to regional and subregional cooperation by helping \nassess the water sector and exchange data, enhance awareness and understanding of water sector \nissues  and  each  country\u2019s  needs,  and  support  water  partnerships  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs).  \n \n2.  On 10 December 2001, the Board approved the establishment of the Cooperation Fund for the \nWater  Sector  (the  Fund).  The  Fund  is  a  multi-donor  umbrella  facility  to  promote  effective  water \nmanagement  policies  and  practices  at  the  regional,  subregional,  and  country  levels,  and  thereby \ncatalyze the implementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in the Asia and Pacific region. The Fund finances a \ncoherent program of activities\u2014designed to add value to the water projects carried out by ADB\u2019s \nregional departments. The activities seek to increase synergy in ADB\u2019s water sector operations through \nbetter awareness, knowledge management, capacity building to support generic sector reforms, pilot \ndemonstration, water partnerships, regional cooperation, monitoring, and coordination. The program \naims to add value to ADB\u2019s water operations, and the Fund is not intended to replace resources for \nregular operational activities.  \n \n3.  Donor contributions to the Fund are made in annual tranches, and these are accessed through \na series of regional technical assistance (TA) projects, Promoting Effective Water Management Policies \nand  Practices  prepared  annually.  The  Government  of  the  Netherlands  has  made  three  annual \ncontributions for a total of $13 million, and the Government of Norway has committed approximately \n$2 million equivalent over 3 years starting in 2003. Since 2002, three regional TA projects have been \napproved under the Fund: TA 6031 ($4 million),2 TA 6093 ($1 million),3 and TA 6123 ($4.3 million).4 \nThe activities approved under these TAs cover all six approved categories of the program, including \n(i) promotion  and  public  awareness;  (ii)  knowledge  base  and  capacity  building;  (iii)  pilot  and \ndemonstrations;  (iv)  water  partnerships;  (v)  regional  events  and  initiatives;  and  (vi) program \ncoordination, monitoring, and evaluation. TA 6031 is substantially completed, TA 6093 completed and \nabout  to  be  closed,  and  TA  6123  almost  fully  committed.  ADB's Water  Sector  Committee  has \nrecommended that a fourth TA be processed in 2004 to access the most recent donor contributions to \nthe Fund. This TA has been prepared to support further activities of the program under the Fund. The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The  Board  paper  establishing  the  Fund  identified  three  areas  of  priority  assistance  in \nimplementing ADB\u2019s water policy and the national water policies in the Asia and Pacific region. The first \narea is assistance to DMCs for water sector assessments and national water action agendas, to design \nand implement critical water sector reforms; and for demonstration of these reforms through pilot \ninitiatives at the appropriate levels, involving national water partnerships and river basin organizations \nto  ensure  broad  stakeholder  participation.  The  second  area  concerns  revising  ADB\u2019s  business \nprocesses and strengthening ADB\u2019s internal capacity to target the water sector more holistically, with \ngreater synergy through knowledge management and collaboration with development partners. The \nthird area is strengthening regional cooperation and awareness of important water issues, trends, and \npolicies, and catalyzing a new generation of water sector investments that follow from effective water \nmanagement policies and sector reforms. The Millennium Development Goals adopted at the World \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank.

", "2    \nSummit  on  Sustainable  Development  in  Johannesburg  in  2002  underline  the  urgency  of  helping \nimprove the water security of the poor through safe drinking water, improved sanitation, water for \nproduction and income generation, sustainable environmental management, and reduced vulnerability \nto water-related disasters.  \n \n5.  The Water Sector Committee has prioritized Fund use, under the overall guidance and strategic \ndirection of a steering committee comprising directors of the concerned divisions in ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments, Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), and  Office of External \nRelations. The steering committee approved the detailed design and implementation arrangements of \nmajor programs, subprojects, or activities, with an estimated cost of over $400,000. A medium-term \nstrategy for Fund-financed activities has been prepared and will be updated in response to evolving \nneeds for assistance and to lessons learned by DMCs and ADB in implementing its water policy. The \nprogress of the program is summarized in Appendix 2 and regularly updated on ADB\u2019s water Web site, \nhttp://www.adb.org/water. \n \n6.  Funding requests from ADB\u2019s regional departments for activities in the DMCs have continued to \nincrease  during  the  past  year,  and  ADB\u2019s  water  focal  point  in  RSDD  has  streamlined  Fund \nadministration, including by delegating activities to regional departments in response to their specific \ndemands, while maintaining the principle of additionality in fund use. Procedures and guidelines are in \nplace to accommodate and prioritize funding requests from DMCs and ADB staff. ADB is coordinating \nregularly with the other multilateral development banks that have similar water fund facilities.  \n \n7.  The Fund\u2019s program was reviewed on three occasions in 2003. The Water Sector Committee \nconducted an in-house assessment as part of its interim review of ADB\u2019s water policy implementation.6 \nThe committee found that the Fund had provided a strategic framework and much-needed financial \nresources to implement the water policy by adding value and creating greater synergy in ADB\u2019s water \noperations. In October 2003, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs conducted a review of its \nWater Unit, from which ADB receives a major contribution for the Fund. The assessment was positive, \nhighlighting good results in implementing water and poverty programs developed in connection with the \n3rd World Water Forum. After the review, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed an \ninterest in replenishing the Fund. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs conducted a progress \nreview consultation with ADB staff in December 2003, and has expressed satisfaction with the progress \nof the Fund\u2019s program.  \n  \n8.  This is the third year of implementing the Fund, and while too early to be definitive about the \nFund\u2019s outcomes and influence on the sector, preliminary indications are that the Fund\u2019s activities are \nsupporting  ADB's  operational  objectives.  Lessons  learned  from  the  Fund\u2019s  program,  and  early \nindications of impact are in Appendix 2. The Fund\u2019s progress will be further assessed when ADB\u2019s \nwater policy implementation is comprehensively reviewed in 2005. Additional TA resources are required \nfrom the Fund to continue the program\u2019s activities in each of the six categories, in accordance with the \nmedium-term strategy prepared by the Water Sector Committee, and in response to requests by ADB\u2019s \nregional departments.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n9.  The TA will continue the program to promote effective water management policies and practices \nat regional, subregional, and country levels, thereby catalyzing the implementation of ADB\u2019s water \npolicy in the Asia and Pacific region, including within ADB. Poverty reduction is a crosscutting objective \nin all the proposed activities. The program activities are targeted at a range of stakeholders in the \nregion,  including  policymakers,  planners,  water  service  providers  and  resource  managers,  ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004. Interim Review of ADB\u2019s Water Policy Implementation. Manila.  \n ", "   3\n \ndecision  makers,  civil-society  organizations,  the  media,  the  public,  ADB  staff,  and  development \npartners. The program will help ADB and DMCs achieve the Millenium Development Goals for water \nand poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Promotion and Public Awareness. The Water Awareness Program (WAP), which has gained \nmomentum and yielded encouraging results since its launch in 2002, will continue to be a major \nprogram under this component. Journalists attending the DMC water media workshops viewed the \nWAP  favorably,  and  the  public  has  been  receptive  to  the  television  documentary  series,  print \npublications, Web site, and electronic newsletter. The WAP will continue to disseminate ADB\u2019s water \npolicy and key development messages in the water sector, advocate priority water reforms to policy-\nand decision makers, increase public awareness and stakeholder dialogue on water policy and reform \nissues, improve press coverage and media networking on water issues and initiatives, educate youth \nabout the water crisis, and support community water education pilot activities in DMCs. Increasingly, \nthe program focus will promote awareness activities as integral to national water sector reform and to \nDMC water sector projects, complemented by products to support regional awareness and cooperation \nprograms.  \n \n11.  Knowledge Base and Capacity Building. Work in this area has produced good results in the \ncomparative analysis of water sector reforms in the DMCs, analysis of water in Asian cities, design of a \nknowledge management system, a capacity assessment, and guidelines to support the preparation of \nwater  sector  road  maps.  The  TA  will  (i)  develop  ADB\u2019s  WaterNet  into  an  effective  knowledge \nmanagement system for the water sector\u2019s community of practice linked to ADB\u2019s water operations; \n(ii) support a second phase of comparative analysis of water sector reforms in DMCs, and a water \nsector capacity development program to enhance core competencies in DMCs and ADB to reform \nwater policies; (iii) develop a program to finance water with advocacy materials and good-practice tools \nto catalyze good policies and decision making in DMCs in connection with ADB\u2019s water operations; and \n(iv) support (a) small-scale private water providers; (b) knowledge management work for dams and \ndevelopment; (c) capacity building for credible water regulators; (d) ADB\u2019s Water Week; and (e) further \ndevelopment and application of tools to assist operations staff on a demand basis, such as in water \nsector  assessments,  water  sector  road  maps,  policy  dialogue,  water  governance  studies,  and \ndiagnostic assessments of capacity in DMC water sector agencies.  \n \n12.  Pilot and Demonstration Activities. A total of 16 pilot and demonstration activities (PDAs) \nhave been approved, and demand from ADB\u2019s regional departments is increasing. The TA will continue \nto support innovative, highly replicable development approaches. Most support will go to water project \nteams in ADB's regional departments, and will strengthen core operations, including policy dialogue, \ncountry programming, and project preparation and implementation. The TA will support field-based \napplied research by local stakeholders, including nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and national \nand subregional water partnerships. Examples of preferred topics are (i) national and local policy \nreform,  (ii) public  awareness,  (iii) appropriate  technology,  (iv) gender  and  development,  (v)  water \nservices for the poor, and (vi) institutional development. PDA results will guide and encourage change \namong water sector stakeholders and will inform policy dialogue between ADB and DMCs.  \n \n13.  Water Partnerships. With support from the Fund, ADB has been able to lead and build several \ndevelopment partnerships in the water sector. The TA will support this work on a demand basis to \ninitiate or strengthen national and regional water partnerships such as Water for the Poor\u2013Partnerships \nfor Action, Gender in Water Partnership, Network of Asian River Basin Organizations, Southeast Asia \nWater Utilities Network, and Water for Asian Cities Program; cooperation among national water sector \napex bodies; national and subregional water partnerships linked to the Global Water Partnership; water \npartnership  activities  of  the  Mekong  River  Commission  and  the  greater  Mekong  subregional \ncooperation program; water cooperation among Pacific island countries; and other partnership activities \nthat help catalyze the implementation of ADB\u2019s water policy.  \n ", "4    \n \n14.  Regional  Events.  Forty-two  regional  events  have  received  support  to  catalyze  the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s water policy. Support will be continued selectively for inter-country dialogues, \nexchange visits, subregional workshops on important water reform topics of common interest, and \nregional and international water forums that help catalyze the implementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in \nthe region and add value to ADB water operations.  \n \n15.  Program Coordination, Monitoring, and Evaluation. Drawing on lessons learned, the TA will \nenhance and maintain the monitoring and reporting system for the Fund to provide updated information \non inputs, outputs, outcomes, and financial management. ADB\u2019s water Web site will continue to be \ncentral to the monitoring and reporting system. The monthly E-newsletter for policy and decision \nmakers in DMCs, and the international water community will be refined and its distribution expanded. \nThe TA will support the 2005 comprehensive review of ADB\u2019s water policy implementation, including \nconsultation workshops and dialogues with NGOs and other stakeholders. The impact of the WAP on \nits target audiences will be determined. Annual reviews of WAP activities will continue with the Fund\u2019s \ncontributors.  The  TA  will  support  the  water  focal  point  in  RSDD  to  continue  the  administration, \ncoordination, monitoring, and technical support of the WAP through RSDD\u2019s water team. Coordination \nwith the other multilateral development banks will continue.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA, estimated at $5.6 million, will be financed on a grant basis by the \nCooperation Fund for the Water Sector and will be administered by ADB.7 The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA, provided, however, that in the case of a PDA, ADB \nwill enter into a separate letter of agreement with each national or international organization or NGO \nthat will implement such PDA. Each national or international organization or NGO selected by ADB for \na  PDA  will  be  designated  as  the  executing  agency  for  such  PDA  and  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  and  completing  it.  The  Agriculture,  Natural  Resources,  and  Social  Sector  Division \n(RSAN) of RSDD, in association with concerned divisions in the regional departments and the Office of \nExternal Relations, will be responsible for all TA activities, and will maintain a water team of consultants \nto  support  the  Fund\u2019s  program  of  activities.  The  Water  Sector  Committee,  or  its  successor  as \ndetermined during the review of ADB\u2019s reorganization, will continue to guide the Fund\u2019s activities in \nconsultation  with  the  Water  Sector  Network.  TA  activities  can  be  proposed  by  DMC  government \nagencies and NGOs, by other development partners, and by ADB staff. Activity proposals will be \nreviewed and prioritized by the Water Sector Committee or its successor, according to criteria and \nprocedures published on ADB\u2019s water Web site. The initiation and implementation of TA activities will \nbe delegated to operations divisions, with administrative and technical support provided by RSAN\u2019s \nwater team. The existing steering committee will supervise TA activities and use of the Fund, including \nits medium-term strategy, and will approve the detailed design and implementation arrangements of \nmajor  programs,  subprojects,  or  activities  of  the  TA  before  they  start.8  Approval  by  the  steering \ncommittee is by consensus, and minutes of the meeting recording the approval are kept. \n \n18.  RSAN  will  serve  as  the  TA  office.  Approximately  111  person-months  of  international  and \n200 person-months of domestic consultants will be needed for the regional departments and RSAN to \nimplement the activities of the TA. The required areas of expertise are expected to include policy, \n                                                 \n7  The governments of the DMCs that will participate in the TA are expected to provide in-kind contributions to facilitate \nimplementation of TA activities such as consultation and training workshops and pilot demonstration activities.  \n8  The steering committee may invite representatives of other ADB departments/divisions\u2014e.g., for private sector operations, \nevaluation, and economics and research\u2014to participate in its meetings. Major programs, subprojects, or activities are \nestimated to cost over $400,000, and they are indicated in the outline terms of reference (Appendix 4). \n ", "   5\n \ninstitutional, technical, economic and financial disciplines related to water reforms. Coordination and \nimplementation  of  the  TA  will  be  supported  by  a  team  leader,  water  policy  adviser,  water  fund \nmonitoring specialist, knowledge management adviser, media and publications specialist, web site \nmanager, website technical specialist, monitoring and evaluation specialist for pilot and demonstration \nactivities, accountant, and administrative assistants, financed by the TA. Further international and \ndomestic consultants may be recruited to fill gaps in the TA team\u2019s expertise. The required consultants \nwill mostly be recruited as individuals. ADB and, in the case of PDAs, the executing agencies of PDAs, \nwill recruit consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to the ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants.  The engagement of \nconsultants by the executing agencies of PDAs shall also be subject to detailed eligibility criteria \ndetermined in consultation with COCS.  Before engaging consultants, executing agencies of PDAs will \nsubmit their curriculum vitae to ADB for approval.  In the case of activity proposals selected by the \nWater  Sector  Committee  or  its  successor  for  water  partnership  support  and  for  regional  events, \nconsulting services by international and national organizations and NGOs will be directly selected by \nADB. Outline terms of reference are shown in Appendix 4. Equipment and materials to be financed by \nthe TA will be procured by the consultants, ADB or in the case of PDAs, the executing agencies of \nPDAs, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement or other procedures acceptable to ADB. \nOwnership of the equipment and materials that have been purchased for specific activities, such as \nunder the PDA or for training, will normally be transferred to the executing agencies and beneficiaries \nwhich will be clearly spelled out on a case by case basis in the letters of agreement and consulting \ncontracts, in accordance with ADB\u2019s normal procedures for technical assistance projects. \n \n19.  Participation in the TA is open to all DMCs. Each participating DMC will designate the water \nsector apex body, or national agency assigned to coordinate water sector activities, as the national \ncounterpart agency. The agency will coordinate the country\u2019s participation in the TA, drawing on the \ninterest and expertise of water stakeholders, including those from central and provincial agencies, river \nbasins, the private sector, NGOs, the academe, research and professional organizations, and other \ninterested parties. DMCs can propose TA activities through ADB regional departments for review and \nprioritization by the Water Sector Committee and RSAN. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from November 2004 to April 2006. Progress \nreports on the program and use of the Fund will be prepared by RSAN semiannually in collaboration \nwith the Office of Cofinancing Operations. TA activities will be monitored and reports made available \nthrough the ADB water Web site. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $5,600,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the \nWater Sector for Promoting Effective Water Management Policies and Practices\u2014Phase 4. \n                                                 \n9  Excluding consultancy services in support of pilot and demonstration activities, water partnerships, and production of \ntelevision  documentaries  and  public  service  announcements,  for  which  requirements  will  be  determined  during \nimplementation. \n10 The required expertise is highly diverse and simultaneously needed in several regional departments. \n11 Equipment may include computers, software, multimedia instruments, and equipment for pilot and demonstration activities. \n ", "6   Appendix 1  \nAppendix 1 \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets   \n       \nGoal       \nPromote effective water  Implementation of ADB\u2019s  World and regional water   \nmanagement policies  water sector road maps in  forums, associated global \nand practices, thereby  DMCs  water sector reviews, and \ncatalyzing the    international Millennium \nimplementation of the  Improved performance for  Development Goal review \nwater policy of the  indicators on the Millennium  panels \nAsian Development  Development Goals for water \nBank (ADB) in ADB\u2019s  and poverty  \ndeveloping member \ncountries (DMCs) \n       \nPurpose       \nContinue to increase  Improved consistency of  Integration of ADB\u2019s water  DMCs sustain their \nsynergy in ADB\u2019s  ADB-financed water projects  policy in ADB\u2019s country  commitment to water \noverall water sector  with ADB\u2019s water policy  strategies and programs  sector reforms, \noperations (internal),      increased public \nand raise public  Development of water sector  Comprehensive review of  awareness, effective \nawareness of water  road maps in ADB\u2019s DMCs  ADB\u2019s water policy  regional cooperation. \nissues (external),    implementation (2005)   \nthrough the use of the  Effective regional cooperation    ADB allocates \nCooperation Fund for  programs in support of ADB\u2019s  Reviews of ADB\u2019s Water  adequate resources \nthe Water Sector (the  water policy  Awareness Program  and coordinates \nFund) objectives    (WAP)  sectors. \nDissemination of key   \nmessages in implementing  Review missions by the \nADB\u2019s water policy in the  Fund\u2019s contributors  \nDMCs \n       \nOutput Categories       \n1.

Promotion and Public Awareness. The Water Awareness Program (WAP) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has gained momentum and yielded encouraging results. The first and \nsecond phases of the WAP supported the production of seven short films under the Water \nVoices television documentary series (the eighth is under production). Ten volumes of the \nWater for All series have been completed, the Water for All Web site developed and regularly \nupdated (http://www.adb.org/water), and a monthly electronic newsletter launched in November \n2003, now reaching over 11,000 subscribers. One regional and six national journalist workshops \nwere conducted on water issues, various articles on water published in the media, and a series \nof one-page water briefs prepared. Exhibitions at important water events, and publicity materials \nfor the 3rd World Water Forum raised public awareness about water during ADB Water Weeks \nand follow-up actions in the region. Feedback from developing member countries (DMCs) on \nthe  multimedia  products  of  the  WAP  was  positive\u2014from,  among  others,  journalists  who \nattended the water media workshops, and several Asian broadcast companies interested in \nshowing the Water Voices documentaries on national television. The WAP is jointly managed by \nADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department and Office of External Relations. \n \n2.  Knowledge  Base  and  Capacity  Building.  The  Fund  has  supported  initiatives  to \nimprove knowledge management and capacity building for DMC counterparts as well as for \nADB  staff.  Externally,  these  efforts  included  a  comparative  analysis  of  DMC  water  sector \nreforms, an analysis of water services in Asian cities, and guidelines for water sector road maps \nto support ADB\u2019s water operations in its DMCs, which produced good results. Internally, this \ncomponent supported ADB\u2019s Water Sector Network, an assessment of water sector capacity \nbuilding  needs  in  DMCs  and  within  ADB,  the  design  of  ADB  WaterNet  as  a  knowledge \nmanagement facility for the water sector community of practice, and the organization of the first \nand second ADB Water Weeks.  \n \n3.   Pilot and Demonstration Activities. Demand from ADB\u2019s regional departments for pilot \nand demonstration activities (PDAs) has increased, and 16 have been approved by ADB\u2019s \nWater Sector Committee (WSC) for implementation under the leadership of regional department \nstaff.  Eight  more  proposals  are  under  consideration.  The  Fund  will  continue  to  support \nintroducing and validating new or innovative, highly replicable development approaches that add \nvalue to ADB\u2019s operations. Figures A2.1 to A2.3 show the cumulative distribution of approved \nPDAs by subregion, subsector, and type. \nFigure A2.1: Regional Distribution of Pilot Demonstration Activities (%)\nEast and Central Asia\n5%\nMekong\nSoutheast Asia\n27%\n24%\nPacific\nSouth Asia\n21%\n23%\n ", "10  Appendix 2  \nFigure A2.2: Subsectoral Distribution of Pilot Demonstration Activities \n(%)\nWastewater \nManagement\nIrrigation Management\n16%\n19%\nWater Resources  Water Supply and \nManagement Sanitation\n39% 26%\nFigure A2.3: Distribution of Pilot Demonstration Activities by Type (%)\nInstitutional \nDevelopment\n11% National or Local Policy \nReform\n20%\nPublic Awareness\n26%\nWater Services to the \nPoor\nGender and \n33%\nDevelopment\n7%\nAppropriate Technology\n3%\n \n4.   Water  Partnerships.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  evolving  strategy  to  promote \npartnerships in managing for development results, several partnerships have been developed to \ncatalyze ADB\u2019s water policy implementation in the region. Some of these partnerships were \nlaunched at, or in follow-up to, the 3rd World Water Forum in 2003. Partnership programs \ndeveloped to date include (i) Water for the Poor\u2013Partnerships for Action, focusing on improving \nthe  water  security  of  the  rural  poor,  with  pilot  implementation  demonstrated  in  Viet Nam; \n(ii) Gender in Water Partnership, in collaboration with the Gender and Water Alliance, which has \nstarted to review gender mainstreaming in ADB\u2019s water operations; (iii) Network of Asian River \nBasin Organizations, in collaboration with the Japan Water Agency and the ADB Institute, with \nmore than 40 organizations from the region signing up as members to jointly build capacity for \nintegrated water resources management; (iv) regional cooperation among national water sector \napex bodies, initiated during the first regional meeting of such bodies in Asia in May 2004; \n(v) Southeast Asia Water Utilities Network, hosted by Viet Nam; (vi) support to implement the \nPacific Regional Water Action Plan, with assistance of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience \nCommission; and (vii) Water for Asian Cities Program in collaboration with UN\u2013Habitat, which \nhas started activities in India. The Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector (the Fund) has also \nhelped catalyze subregional water cooperation in the Pacific, among central Asian countries, for \n ", "                                                                                                                             Appendix 2  11\n \nthe Southeast Asia regional water partnership, and for the Mekong River Commission in flood \nmanagement.  \n \n5.   Regional Events and Initiatives. The Fund has supported a series of regional events to \npromote ADB\u2019s water policy. Foremost among these was the 3rd World Water Forum in 2003 in \nKyoto,  Japan,  and  its  preparatory  consultations  and  follow-up  initiatives.  A  total  of \n42 subregional  events  were  also  supported,  e.g.,  workshops  on  water  rights,  participatory \nirrigation management, watershed management, and other important topics. ADB staff have \nmade presentations at important water events in the region and elsewhere to raise awareness, \nbuild capacity, strengthen partnerships, and learn from development partners\u2019 activities.  \n \n6.   Program Coordination, Monitoring, and Evaluation. The Fund has supported annual \ncoordination meetings with other multilateral development banks that have similar water funds, \nand for the organization of regular dialogue events with nongovernment organizations on water \npolicy and operational issues. Annual reports on ADB\u2019s water sector operations have been \nissued  by  ADB\u2019s  WSC,  which  conducted  the  interim  review  of  ADB\u2019s  water  policy \nimplementation in 2003.  Consultants in the Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Social Sectors \nDivision (RSAN)  financed by the Fund have supported these activities. \n \n7.  The WSC has actively guided Fund use with the support the RSAN water team. The \nFund steering committee, comprising directors of the concerned operations divisions in ADB\u2019s \nregional departments, has met regularly to guide and supervise the Fund\u2019s program of activities, \nand  to  approve  the  detailed  design  and  implementation  arrangements  of  major  program \ncomponents under the Fund. Figure A2.4 shows the organization structure for implementing the \nFund.

Lessons  Learned.  As  part  of  the  2003  interim  review  of  ADB\u2019s  water  policy \nimplementation,  a  survey  among  division  directors  and  Water  Sector  Committee  members \nindicated that the Fund has provided a strategic framework and financial support to improve \nwater  awareness,  knowledge  management,  and  capacity  building  as  part  of  ADB\u2019s  water \noperations. The Fund has also enabled ADB to finance pilot and demonstration activities, and to \n ", "                                                                                                                             Appendix 2  13\n \nimprove networking and regional initiatives in support of the water policy. This was an invaluable \ncomplement to add value to increasingly scarce technical assistance (TA) resources allocated \nto project preparation. Implementation of the earlier three regional TAs yielded valuable lessons, \nfurther sharpening the focus of the Fund so that it increases synergy and adds value to ADB\u2019s \nwater operations. \n \n9.  By playing a leading role in the 3rd World Water Forum, ADB has improved governance \nof the water sector as demonstrated in forum\u2019s follow-up actions, which include (i) Water for the \nPoor\u2013Partnership for Action, (ii) Network of Asian River Basin Organizations, (iii) Gender in \nWater Partnership, and (iv) Water for Asian Cities Program. The events were good venues to \nraise the profile of ADB and to showcase the importance and quality of work done in the water \nsector, particularly in reducing poverty.  \n \n10.  The activities undertaken in the thematic area of water and poverty were successful in \nViet Nam, where the Water for the Poor\u2013Partnerships for Action are being piloted. The results \nshow how the design of lending programs can focus more on poverty and how the Water for the \nPoor\u2013Partnerships  for  Action  initiative  can  be  used  as  leverage  for  accessing  bilateral \ncofinancing, thus enhancing donor coordination in DMCs. \n \n11.  The  recent  Netherlands  Review  Mission  (end  of  2003)  commended  the \naccomplishments of ADB\u2019s Water Sector Committee, especially its water and poverty initiatives \nand focus on water and gender, and requested that this experience be shared with other \nmultilateral development banks.  \n \n12.  The Fund continues to support the participation of ADB staff and their DMC counterparts \nin international conferences, forums, and seminars, giving staff the opportunity to further hone \ntheir knowledge and skills, thus improving capacity.  \n \n13.   The 1st and 2nd ADB  Water Week held in 2002 and 2004, respectively, stimulated \nknowledge  and  information  sharing  on  critical  water  sector  issues,  facilitated  change  in \nmindsets, and promoted good policies and sector reforms. The 2004 Water Week, in particular, \nhas resulted in an agenda for change that will further add value to the work in the sector. This \nchange agenda includes the following: \n \n(i)  Changing selection criteria: working with the right information, organizations, and \nleaders \n(ii)  Changing incentives and advocacy: empowering civil society as catalysts of reforms \n(iii)  Changing regulation: from independent to credible regulation \n(iv)  Changing the rules to reward efficiency: linking formal and informal water providers \n(v)  Changing the focus of lending: catalyzing water investments to the rural poor \n(vi)  Changing the nature of water project: investing more in nonstructural interventions  \n(vii)  Changing partners: from national to sub-sovereign entities. \n \n14.  More work is needed in knowledge management. Experience shows the importance of \ndisseminating  knowledge  acquired,  and  the  challenge  remains  to  disseminate  it  to  ADB\u2019s \npartners and stakeholders, and within ADB. \n \n ", "14  Appendix 3  \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \n   \nCooperation Fund for the Water Sector Financinga   \n   \n  1.

The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  describe  the  main  tasks  in  the \nsix categories of the program of activities to promote effective water management policies and \npractices, and thereby catalyze implementation of the water policy of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in the Asia and Pacific region. The categories are promotion and public awareness; \nknowledge base and capacity building; pilot and demonstration; water partnerships; regional \nevents and initiatives; and program coordination, monitoring, and evaluation. Poverty reduction \nis a crosscutting priority in all tasks. ADB\u2019s Water Sector Committee (WSC) will guide the \nprogram of activities, which will be coordinated by the Agriculture, Natural Resources, and \nSocial Sector Division (RSAN). \n \n \nA.  Promotion and Public Awareness  \n2.  An international senior public relations program management specialist will be engaged \non an individual and intermittent basis for 1 year to manage the third phase of ADB\u2019s Water \nAwareness Program (WAP), together with an associate who will support networking among \njournalists in the region and other media activities. The WAP\u2019s continuing objectives are to \n(i) promote  public  understanding  of  water  issues  and  disseminate  ADB\u2019s  water  policy, \n(ii) facilitate dialogue among water stakeholders on the water reform agenda in the region, \n(iii) help educate children and youth on water issues and their role in finding solutions, and \n(iv) support small pilot and demonstration activities for community water education.  \n \n3.  The WAP will continue, and further strengthen, the three-fold strategy adopted in its \nsecond phase to shift water awareness activities (i) from regional to country levels, focusing \nmore on developing member country (DMC) clients and stakeholders, working more closely with \nADB operations staff, and supporting more awareness-building activities in the DMCs; (ii) from \npublicity to knowledge, emphasizing the dissemination of knowledge products for advocacy and \nbetter practices in ADB\u2019s water operations; and (iii) from parallel to concerted implementation, \nincreasing the synergy among WAP tools and media, investing more to integrate activities \nthrough ADB\u2019s water Web site and other effective means of communications, and coordinating \nmore closely with ADB\u2019s knowledge management applications.  \n \n4.  The WAP will continue to use a range of suitable tools and activities to effectively \ncommunicate a range of messages to different target audiences, including (i) water sector policy \nand decision makers and stakeholders, including ADB staff; (ii) children and youth; (iii) poor \ncommunities; and (iv) the public in the Asia and Pacific region. The WAP will help strengthen \nADB\u2019s  collaboration  with  the  media  in  reaching  these  target  audiences.  The  development \nmessages will be derived from ADB\u2019s water policy, from the results of regional cooperation \nundertaken earlier, and from other key water themes in coordination with development partners.  \n \n5.  The  tools  and  activities  will  include  ADB\u2019s  water  Web  site,  a  regional  electronic \nnewsletter, print publications, publicity materials and photographs, television documentaries and \nvideo productions, public service announcements, media relations and networking, exhibitions, \npilot community education activities, other pilot activities to promote water awareness in DMCs, \nand other complementary activities as determined by the WSC. The design and implementation \narrangements of the WAP\u2019s third phase will be approved by the Cooperation Fund for the Water \nSector (the Fund) steering committee before implementation starts. \n \n ", "16  Appendix 4  \n6.  International  specialists  (with  expertise  in  public  and  media  relations;  multimedia \nproduction; and information, education, and communication, with strong writing ability) will be \nengaged as individuals to work on the WAP team. They will work together with domestic \nconsultants,  including  a  media  and  publications  specialist,  Web  site  manager,  Web  site \ntechnical specialist, and other specialists as needed, who will be engaged on an individual \nbasis. The leader of RSAN\u2019s water team will coordinate the day-to-day activities of the WAP \nconsultants in RSAN. In close collaboration with ADB\u2019s Office of External Relations, WSC, \nWater Sector Network, and other operations staff in the regional departments, the WAP team \nwill work in RSAN to undertake the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Help ADB staff further develop and effectively use key development messages \nrelated to water sector issues and themes, covering water and poverty reduction; \neffective  water  policies;  issues  related  to  water  service  delivery  and  water \nresources  management;  crosscutting  subjects  such  as  gender,  water  rights, \nprivate sector participation, and financing; thematic issues such as water quality, \ndams,  and  development;  and  supporting  topics  in  subsectors  such  as \ngroundwater management, flood management, and watershed management. \n(ii)  Help ADB regional department staff disseminate development messages derived \nfrom pilot and demonstration activities (PDAs) in DMCs in relation to water sector \nreforms or water-related project preparation and implementation.  \n(iii)  Help  ADB  regional  department  staff  members  conduct  PDAs  on  community \nwater  education  as  part  of  ADB-financed  water  projects,  focusing  on  poor \ncommunities that have taken initiatives to improve water-related services for the \npoor and on the sustainable management of water resources. \n(iv)  Conduct  workshops  for  journalists  reporting  on  water  issues  in  DMCs,  and \nsupport networking among such journalists in the region, in close collaboration \nwith ADB resident missions and regional department staff. \n(v)  Help ADB further develop and manage its water Web site as an integrated tool \nfor  providing  information,  raising  awareness,  encouraging  networking,  and \nsupporting knowledge management. \n(vi)  Develop and disseminate water sector information and knowledge in a series of \nWater for All print publications, reports, and briefs on important water issues and \nmessages. \n(vii)  Develop  and  disseminate  publicity  materials  to  support  water  awareness  in \ninterested DMCs and in the Asia and Pacific region as a whole.  \n(viii)  Help ADB develop and place a series of articles on important water issues in \nnational, regional, and international media, and in ADB Review. \n(ix)  Help  ADB  publish  its  monthly  Water  for  All  electronic  newsletter,  provide \ninformation on water sector reforms in the region, and facilitate dialogue among \nwater stakeholders on important water sector issues in connection with ADB\u2019s \nWater web site. \n(x)  Help ADB distribute the earlier Water Voices television documentary series. \n(xi)  Produce two additional television documentaries on water issues for the Water \nVoices series, on topics to be determined by RSAN in consultation with ADB\u2019s \nregional departments.  \n(xii)  Continue to produce and place ADB public service announcements for regional \nand international broadcasters based on the television documentaries. \n(xiii)  Start helping DMC radio stations promote water messages and programming. \n(xiv)  Organize exhibitions at regional and international events as needed. \n(xv)  Help ADB develop partnership programs with other organizations to promote and \ncatalyze water awareness activities in the Asia and Pacific region. \n ", "   17\nAppendix 4 \n(xvi)  Manage and update ADB\u2019s water reference center as the repository of print \npublications, manuals, guidelines, publicity materials, reports, films and television \ndocumentaries, reports, and briefs on important water sector issues for use by \nADB\u2019s WSC, network, and consultants. \n \n7.  Consulting services for the WAP\u2019s third phase are expected to comprise approximately \n20 person-months of international and 40 person-months of domestic consultants. A detailed \nwork plan will be submitted to the Fund steering committee for endorsement.  \n \n \nB.  Knowledge Base and Capacity Building  \n8.  International and domestic water policy and institutional development specialists will be \nengaged on an individual and intermittent basis to do the following: \n \n(i)  Advise  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  on  supporting  country  water  sector \nassessments, sector road maps, strategies, policy dialogue, and reforms.  \n(ii)  Conduct thematic, in-country, and comparative analyses of ongoing water sector \nreforms  in  the  region,  including  studies  on  water  governance,  involving  the \nestablishment  and  performance  of  water  sector  apex  bodies,  water  policies, \nwater laws, water sector action agendas, river basin organizations, regulatory \nbodies, and other water institutions. \n(iii)  Organize capacity development programs for ADB and DMC staff on important \nwater issues and skills, drawing on the results of the earlier capacity and training \nneeds assessments, including training seminars and workshops, participation in \ntraining courses, recommendations for country exchange dialogues on priority \nwater  sector  reform  topics,  strengthening  of  ADB\u2019s  water  focal  point,  and \ndevelopment of regional research and capacity-building networks in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s water policy. \n(iv)  Organize ADB Water Week. \n(v)  Conduct follow-up studies building on the results of the 3rd World Water Forum \nand  ADB\u2019s  Water  Weeks,  e.g.,  in  financing  water  programs,  the  role  of \nsmall-scale independent service providers, and other subjects as determined by \nthe WSC.  \n(vi)  Promote  knowledge  generation  and  dissemination  on  other  important  water \ntopics, including on dams and development.  \n \n9.  The international specialists will generally be engaged intermittently in the areas of water \ngovernance, sector reforms, and dams and development, and work with full-time domestic \nspecialists in RSAN, including a water policy adviser, water fund-monitoring specialist, and \nknowledge  management  adviser,  who  will  be  engaged  as  individuals.  These  domestic \nspecialists will be responsible to develop existing ADB databases into the WaterNet community \nof practice system to support ADB\u2019s water operations, with links to ADB\u2019s water Web site. The \nsystem will provide water sector statistics by DMC, including national water sector profiles, \npolicies, laws, and sector road maps for DMCs; a compilation of useful practices in key water \nsector reform topics and on poverty reduction in water sector operations; and links to water \nknowledge centers outside ADB.  \n \n10.  Services  for  knowledge  base  and  capacity  building  are  expected  to  comprise \napproximately  25  person-months  of  international  and  62  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants.  \n ", "18  Appendix 4  \nC.  Pilot and Demonstration Activities \n11.  International and national nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and, where needed, \ninternational  and/or  domestic  short-term  consultants  (with  expertise  as  required)  will  be \nengaged as individuals to help regional department staff conduct PDAs in DMCs, according to \nthe WSC guidelines. PDAs will mostly complement ADB water operations and should be driven \nby the needs of ADB\u2019s regional departments and project officers, who develop the proposals for \nactivities to be supported by the Fund.  \n \n12.  Water sector road maps prepared under ADB\u2019s country strategy and program process \nhighlight  expected  changes  and  achievements  in  the  water  sector.  These  development \nexpectations may require the introduction of new ideas, technologies, and approaches to the \nsector. The changes may be at the national level (e.g., achieving national policy and reform \noutcomes)  down  to  the  local  level  (e.g.,  achieving  widespread  application  of  market-level \ntechnologies, approaches, and arrangements). Changes may be possible in more than one \ncountry. Bringing innovation to bear involves (i) research and experimentation to validate the \ninnovation, and (ii) advocacy to ensure decision makers and other stakeholders agree to the \nchanges. The Fund-supported PDAs should therefore introduce and validate new or innovative \napproaches that are highly replicable.  \n \n13.  The PDAs constitute a small-grants program to help ADB teams develop, validate, and \ndemonstrate new approaches during the processing and implementation of project preparation \nand  advisory  TA,  and  loan-financed  investment  projects.  Activities  can  include  field-based \napplied research and demonstration, which are likely to be proposed by local stakeholders, \nincluding NGOs.  \n \n14.  PDAs are generally expected to test or highlight new approaches, confirm their efficacy, \nand then implement or plan a replication program. PDAs can be processed in connection with \nchanges  in  (i)  national  or  local  water  policy  reform  processes,  (ii)  WAP  approaches, \n(iii) appropriate  technology,  (iv)  gender  and  development  approaches,  (v) participatory  and \ninclusive approaches and multistakeholder representation, (vi) connecting services to the poor, \nand  (vii)  other  changes  catalyzed  by  ADB\u2019s  water  policy.  PDAs  can  be  related  to  the \nmanagement of water resources and the delivery of water services. \n \n15.  The  amount  to  be  drawn  from  the  Fund  for  a  PDA  will  normally  not  exceed \n$50,000 equivalent.  When  this  ceiling  does  not  allow  critical  mass  for  the  development, \nvalidation,  or  demonstration  of  the  new  approach  under  study,  or  activities  taking  place \nsimultaneously in multiple locations within or among DMCs, a limited number of large, strongly \njustified PDAs can be considered, as guided by the WSC and the Fund steering committee. A \nPDA is expected to be implemented over 6 months on average, and 12 months at most. PDAs \nshould not duplicate, or substitute for, ongoing or pipelined activities in the DMCs, but should be \ndirectly relevant to the \u201csector outcomes\u201d cited in the country strategy program/country strategy \nprogram updates for the DMC.  \n \n16.  In prioritizing requests for PDAs, the WSC will consider the following: (i) originality, \n(ii) replicability, (iii) potential replicability (in case of pilot test), (iv) lessons learned, (v) pro-poor \nfocus,  (vi)  participatory  development  and  gender  inclusion,  (vii) operations  support, \n(viii) collaborative  approach  using  partnerships,  (ix) technically  strong  design,  and \n(x) consistency with ADB\u2019s water policy. \n \n ", "   19\nAppendix 4 \n17.  The type and duration of inputs for the PDA will be provided in the activity proposals to \nbe submitted by concerned departments in ADB during TA implementation.  \n \n18.  Monitoring of PDAs will be assisted by a domestic consultant, who will analyze and \ncompile results and lessons learned for scaling-up and replication (estimated input 4 person \nmonths on an intermittent basis). \n \n \nD.  Water Partnerships \n19.  International and/or domestic water sector specialists will be engaged to help RSAN and \nregional department staff support selected activities of national or regional water partnerships, \nwhich are expected to include the following: \n \n(i)  Water for the Poor\u2013Partnerships for Action; \n(ii)  Gender in Water Partnership Network of Asian River Basin Organizations; \n(iii)  regional cooperation among national water sector apex bodies; \n(iv)  Southeast Asia Water Utilities Network; \n(v)  Water for Asian Cities Program; \n(vi)  national and subregional water partnerships established on the model and with \nsupport of the Global Water Partnership; \n(vii)  Mekong River Commission\u2019s flood management and other partnership activities \namong countries of the lower Mekong River basin; \n(viii)  South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission, mandated to assist 18 Pacific \nIsland Countries; and \n(ix)  other water partnerships as needed, including a possible partnership with the \nInterpress Wire Service (IPS) for the water media network. \n \n20.  The type and duration of consulting inputs for the water partnership support activities will \nbe provided in the proposals to be submitted by concerned departments in ADB during the TA.  \n \n21.  Services  for  water  partnerships  are  expected  to  comprise  approximately \n18 person-months of international and 12 person-months of domestic consultants.  \n \n \nE.  Regional Events and Initiatives \n22.  International and/or domestic short-term water sector specialists will be engaged as \nindividuals to support (sub)regional events that are important to catalyze ADB\u2019s water policy \nimplementation. The latter may require modest consulting service inputs, and their type and \nduration will be provided in the proposals to be submitted by concerned departments in ADB \nduring the TA.  \n \n23.  Services for regional events and initiatives are expected to comprise approximately \n6 person-months of international and 10 person-months of domestic consultants.  \n \n \nF.  Program Coordination, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n24.  International and domestic specialists, including a water team leader, accountant, and \nmembers of the comprehensive water policy review panel, will be engaged as individuals to \n ", "20  Appendix 4  \ncarry out the following tasks in RSAN to help coordinate, monitor, and evaluate the program of \nFund-financed activities, and ADB\u2019s water policy: \n \n(i)  Further develop a monitoring system for the program of Fund-financed activities, \ncovering inputs, outputs, outcomes, and financial management. \n(ii)  Help monitor and organize annual reviews of the program\u2019s activities. \n(iii)  Help exchange experiences and coordinate with other development partners to \nfacilitate joint activities, as needed. \n(iv)  Help  prepare  the  annual  report  on  ADB\u2019s  water  sector  operations,  including \nstatistics and lessons learned, and a 3-year work program for the water sector, \nincluding analysis of challenges, constraints, and opportunities. \n(v)  Organize regular dialogues between ADB and stakeholders, including NGOs, on \nwater reform issues. \n(vi)  Organize  and  support  the  comprehensive  review  of  ADB\u2019s  water  policy \nimplementation in 2005, as stipulated in the policy paper. \n(vii)  Initiate a survey of the impact of WAP activities and products on a sample of the \ntarget audiences. \n \n25.  Consulting services for program coordination, monitoring, and evaluation are expected \nto comprise approximately 42 person-months of international and 72 person-months of domestic \nconsultants.  \n   \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041228111123+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041203143038+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RETA 4 final 26Nov.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "jd3", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
