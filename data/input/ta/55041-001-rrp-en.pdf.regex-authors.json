THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Strengthening Social Resilience Program, and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for subprogram 1 of the Strengthening \nSocial Resilience Program. The report also describes the proposed administration of technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the Strengthening \nSocial Resilience Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed program aims to support the Government of Bangladesh in strengthening \nthe social resilience of its people. The programmatic approach, consisting of two subprograms, is \nproposed to design and support sequenced policy packages and to enhance the inclusiveness \nand responsiveness of social development in Bangladesh.1 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Bangladesh  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  reducing  poverty  over  the  past  two \ndecades. The poverty incidence declined from 48.9% in 2000 to 20.5% in 2019.2 However, while \nmany people were lifted from extreme poverty, a considerable number continue to live at a \nsubsistence level barely sustained by day work. These are the people who are highly vulnerable \nto shocks such as major illnesses and external events, including disasters triggered by natural \nhazards. The 2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) indicated that in addition \nto those living below the poverty line, 18.6%3 of the population remained vulnerable.4 \n \n4.  The nature of poverty and vulnerability gradually changed as the country underwent \nurbanization and demographic transformation. The share of the urban population doubled from \n20% in 1990 to close to 40% by 2019. Poverty declined in both urban and rural areas, but the \ndecline was greater in rural areas. The number of rural poor fell from 52 million in 1995 to less \nthan 38 million by 2016, while the number of urban poor was kept constant at about 12 million.5 \nFurther, demographic changes are creating a new type of vulnerability. The share of elderly \npeople (aged 60 and over) is estimated to be increasing from 7.1% in 2015 to 9.6% by 2025, and \nto reach 22.0% by 2050 (footnote 3). This has implications for the country's social protection \nneeds since it does not have a comprehensive pension system in place. The 2016 HIES showed \nthat almost 50% of the elderly were poor or vulnerable.  \n \n5.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic significantly affected the socioeconomic \nsituation of Bangladesh. The growth rate of its gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 3% \nin 2020, from a pre-COVID-19 estimate of 8.2%. The economy took a particularly sharp turn in \nApril\u2013May 2020 when international trade and remittances declined substantially. Unemployment \n \n1  The policy design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2019. Bangladesh Statistics 2019. Dhaka. \n3  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, General Economics Division. 2020. Midterm Progress Review \non the National Social Security Strategy. Dhaka. \n4  Bangladesh defines vulnerable people as those having incomes above the national poverty line but below a level of \n25% more, i.e., below 1.25 times the national poverty line. \n5  While the urban poverty rate declined in relative terms because of the increase in the total urban population, the \nabsolute number of urban poor remained fairly constant. \n ", "2 \nsurged to 22.4% during April\u2013July 2020, from 2.1% in March 2020.6 Among those hit hardest by \nthe pandemic are poor people who faced further impoverishment, and many vulnerable people \nwho fell back into poverty. \n \n6.  To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government introduced stimulus \npackages in March 2020, such as financial support for health workers and for employment \ngeneration. Macroeconomic policies, including monetary and exchange rate interventions, were \neffective in ensuring external balance and price stability, and helped respond rapidly and flexibly \nto the internal and external impacts of COVID-19. International trade and remittances have been \nrecovering since late 2020. The unemployment rate decreased to 3.8% in September 2020 \n(footnote 6). The fiscal deficit is at a manageable level. Both the external debt ratio and the public \ndebt ratio are stable in the medium term. Debt policy and management also remain strong and \nprudent, which keeps Bangladesh at low risks of debt distress.7 The International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) provided an assessment letter.8 According to it, Bangladesh\u2019s economy is recovering due \nto the implementation of the stimulus packages and an expansionary fiscal policy, and it properly \neased its monetary policy to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic. However, the \nuncertainty of a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic remains. Since late March 2021, Bangladesh is \nexperiencing a second wave of the pandemic, and the government had to impose a lockdown to \ncontrol it, which is expected to slow down the economic recovery and further threatens the \nlivelihoods of poor and vulnerable people. \n \n7.  Continued social protection support is critical to cushioning the effects of the pandemic. \nThe government intends to leverage the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to strengthen its \nsocial  protection  programs  as  an  essential  means  of  building  the  resilience  of  the  poor;9 \nsupporting inclusive recovery; and working toward faster, sustainable, and resilient development. \n \n8.  In 2015, the government formulated the National Social Security Strategy (NSSS) with a \nmedium-to-long-term framework for social protection development.10 The NSSS presents the \nlong-term vision of building an inclusive social protection system that helps prevent poverty and \ninequality and contributes to broader human development. It seeks to streamline and strengthen \nthe existing social protection programs with a view to achieving better results from the money \nspent. It defines the medium-term reform targets: (i) improving the coverage of social protection, \n(ii) developing a national social insurance scheme (NSIS), (iii) harmonizing the social protection \nprograms,  (iv) improving  financial  inclusion  by  promoting  the  government  to  person  (G2P) \npayment system, (v) strengthening the grievance redress mechanisms, and (vi) developing a \nresults-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. The Eighth Five-Year Plan for 2020\u2013\n2025 (8th plan) stresses the importance of a wider and more inclusive social protection system \nfor an inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The 8th plan suggests accelerating the \nsocial protection reforms defined in the NSSS. \n \n9.  Development  constraints.  The  NSSS  points  to  critical  shortcomings  in  the  social \nprotection system: (i) fragmentation with too many programs and targeting errors, (ii) inadequate \n \n6  Government of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2020.

Dhaka. \n ", "3 \ncoverage  and  benefits,  and  (iii)  narrow  scope  of  social  protection.11 It  also  highlights  the \nincreasing importance of achieving financial inclusion of disadvantaged people through advanced \nfinancial and digital technologies. It further suggests a conceptual change from the current \nfragmented approach to a life cycle approach that tackles causes of poverty at different stages of \nlife. For example, the life cycle approach considers maternal support to reduce the economic risks \nassociated with pregnancy and early childhood, and support for the elderly to mitigate the risks \nassociated with old age and disability. The current social protection scope in Bangladesh is too \nlimited to meet the varying social needs arising in a life cycle. \n \n10.  Fragmentation with too many programs. Bangladesh\u2019s social protection initiatives were \ndeveloped ad hoc, which led to the creation of too many programs and a fragmented system. The \nearly efforts focused mainly on post-disaster relief to support the affected people. Food security \nprograms were also initiated early on, focusing on the extreme poor in rural areas and on seasonal \npoverty during lean agricultural periods. Various social protection programs were established to \nmeet  specific  needs. More  than  100  programs  involving  multiple  implementation  ministries \neventually emerged, often leading to duplications and inefficient service delivery, and reducing \nthe impact of social protection. The largest 20 programs receive about 70% of the total social \nprotection budget, while the smallest 50 programs receive less than 2%. The midterm review of \nthe NSSS suggested to consolidate programs to avoid duplications, extend beneficiary coverage, \nand achieve efficiency. The NSSS envisages such a program consolidation at the ministerial level, \nbut this has not happened. The government first needs to prepare the policy base to facilitate \nministerial actions. \n \n11.  Further, the programs lack integrated administrative processes as they are managed by \nvarious ministries, such as the Ministry of Social Welfare (MSW), the Ministry of Women and \nChildren Affairs, and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. The program administration \nis not fully digitalized, making it hard to collect comprehensive data and information on social \nprotection beneficiaries, and to implement effective M&E. In addition, social protection programs \nin Bangladesh have high targeting errors\u2014both exclusion errors (i.e., when people are not \ncovered by social protection despite being eligible) and inclusion errors (i.e., when non-eligible \npeople are covered) (footnote 3). The NSSS stresses the importance of establishing an integrated \nregistry of social protection beneficiaries with a functional management information system (MIS), \nwhich  will  improve  registration  transparency,  reduce  duplication,  increase  the  efficiency  of \nprograms, and maximize the overall benefits of social protection. It will also make M&E more \neffective.  \n \n12.  Inadequate coverage. Despite the large number of social protection programs, the \nbudgetary allocation for social protection has been low in Bangladesh\u20141.0%\u20131.5% of GDP. This \nmeans that many programs do not have enough resources to make a substantial impact on their \ntarget groups or are not able to cover all the eligible people. This is true even for key programs \nsuch as the old age allowance or the allowance for widowed, deserted, and destitute women.12 \nFor example, about 380 of 492 upazilas (administrative units at the subdistrict level) cover only \n60%\u201370% of the eligible elderly or the eligible women under those programs. As the 8th plan \nhighlights, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the substantial social vulnerabilities and the \nneed for scaling up the government's spending on social protection. The plan suggests increasing \ngovernment expenditure on social protection from 1.2% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2019 to 2.0% \nof GDP by FY2025. \n \n11 Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 The old age allowance program provides poor elderly people with a reliable source of income. The allowance program \nfor widowed, deserted, and destitute women provides cash transfers to eligible women. \n ", "4 \n13.  Financial exclusion. The government recognizes the potential of financial inclusion for \ndisadvantaged people to increase their income-generating opportunities and strengthen their \nsocial resilience. The Seventh Five-Year Plan for 2016\u20132020 suggested promoting financial \ninclusiveness by developing and enhancing the G2P payment system (digital payment of social \nprotection benefits).13 The NSSS also highlights the issue of financial inclusion and the potential \nof G2P to enhance financial inclusion of social protection beneficiaries. The 8th plan reinforces \nthis policy direction (footnote 9). However, Bangladesh has not yet developed an enabling \nenvironment for it. Nearly 50% of the population is still unbanked.14 A main stumbling block are \nthe documentation and identification requirements for opening a bank account. To improve \naccess to financial services, the government aims to enhance the use of mobile financial services \n(MFS), which are becoming popular even among disadvantaged people, including women and \nmicrobusiness operators. However, MFS transactions are not interoperable across all the banks \nand all MFS providers, which hinders their wider use. Further, current MFS in Bangladesh do not \nmatch the needs of poor households. Poor households need financial products that allow small-\nvalue day-to-day transactions, yet the acceptance of digital payments is still limited among \nretailers and merchants. Moreover, disadvantaged people tend to be hesitant about accessing \nfinancial and digital services because of their limited financial and digital literacy. The regulatory \nauthority needs to lower the barriers for disadvantaged people and ease their access to financial \nservices. It also needs to establish incentives for financial institutions and MFS providers to \nimprove the availability of their services, and for retailers to accept digital payments more broadly. \n \n14.  Limited  scope  to  meet  life  cycle  social  and  health  needs.  Social  protection  in \nBangladesh focuses on poverty relief in rural areas. Urbanization creates a gap between social \nneeds and available protection because the system does not meet the diversified social needs. \nFor example, social protection provides a safety net for seasonal unemployment during lean \nagricultural periods, but it has no scheme to help mitigate the impacts of employment loss or \nsickness on many urban workers. Individuals face different risks across the life cycle, from birth \nto old age. The poverty rates in households with children aged 0\u20134 years are higher than the \nnational poverty rates, which indicates the economic challenges caused by having children, \nparticularly if mothers are unable to work (footnote 10). The working-age population faces other \nrisks, such as risks relating to job security. The elderly people face the economic risks associated \nwith aging, such as loss of income and health care costs. Further, economic risks associated with \nhealth and injury incidents can occur at any stage of life. Bangladesh's social protection system \nneeds to be upgraded in line with the economic and demographic developments, and not only to \nmitigate extreme poverty but also to respond to the diversified social and health needs at different \nlife stages. \n \n15.  For the first time in the social protection of Bangladesh, the NSSS presented the concept \nof risk pooling by proposing to establish an insurance scheme, such as unemployment insurance \nand occupational injury insurance. The NSSS recognizes the initiation of the NSIS as a major \nprogrammatic reform. Further, the NSSS stresses that health-related shocks could be devastating \nfor poor and vulnerable people. The need for health care services is high in rapidly urbanizing \nareas, but the availability of quality and affordable health services remains limited for many urban \npeople. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need to tackle the weaknesses and \nstrengthen health response and preparedness for unanticipated health crises. \n \n \n13 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, General Economics Division. 2015.

The program is aligned with the country partnership \nstrategy, 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Bangladesh, which prioritizes \ninvestments in human capital through social programs and improved rural livelihoods;15 and with \nthe operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly 1\u2014addressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities, 2\u2014accelerating progress in gender equality, and 6\u2014strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.16 The program will (i) have direct positive impacts on poor, \nvulnerable women and men by improving the coverage of key social protection programs, \n(ii) contribute to gender equality by ensuring the consideration of gender-specific needs in urban \nhealth planning, and (iii) strengthen the institutional capacity for social protection by reforming the \nadministration and management of social protection programs. \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n17.  Proposed policy reforms. The program provides holistic support to the institutional and \npolicy reforms that will improve the inclusiveness and responsiveness of social development. It \ndefines three reform areas to tackle the cross-sector issues of social development: (i) reform the \nsocial protection system by improving its coverage and efficiency, (ii) ease the policy constraints \non financial inclusion, and (iii) transform social protection by broadening its scope. The policy \nactions are sequenced to allow the optimal phasing of reforms. Subprogram 1 supports the \nestablishment of the national policy frameworks and the removal of technical and administrative \nconstraints that make the social protection system inefficient. Building on this, subprogram 2 will \nfocus on improving the administrative efficiency of the system and on strengthening its response \nto the diversified social and health needs of the people in Bangladesh. \n \n18.  Reform area 1: Coverage and efficiency of social protection improved. This reform \narea focuses on improving the coverage and administration of key social protection programs. To \nreduce fragmentation, it will support harmonization of the social protection system through the \nprogram consolidation. To make their management more efficient, the reforms will support to \nstandardize and integrate the administrative processes across programs. \n \n19.  For subprogram 1, the government approved an increase in the coverage of the old age \nallowance, and of the allowance for widowed, deserted, and destitute women, to attain the full \ncoverage of eligible people in 150 upazilas.17 These upazilas were selected based on the Poverty \nMaps of Bangladesh and represent the poverty-stricken areas.18 In addition, the Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  operationalized  an  MIS  for  administration  of  the  social  protection  budget \nmanagement over various programs by implementing the automatic data transfer from MIS \ndatabases of relevant line ministries to the MOF\u2019s MIS; this will help standardize and digitalize \nthe administration of social protection program management and improve the efficiency of service \ndelivery. The programs that have similar features and purposes will be consolidated. To make \nsure that the consolidated schemes and processes are carefully designed and the provision of \nbenefits to eligible people is not interrupted, the government targeted key ministries and issued a \ndirective on the program consolidation to be undertaken by those ministries in subprogram 2. It \ninstructs these ministries to prepare and approve the necessary policies and instruments, such \n \n15 ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020. Manila.

Under subprogram 2, The ministries will then prepare and approve the policies of program \nconsolidation and announce the initial steps of the program consolidation.19 The consolidation will \nreduce the duplication of programs and harmonize the social protection system. To reform \nprogram administration, the government will set up an integrated registry of social protection \nbeneficiaries, which will enable it to manage various programs with an integrated entry point for \nthe beneficiaries. The integrated system will not affect targeting or the selection of beneficiaries. \nIt will bring beneficiaries under an integrated system, which will improve the processes of benefit \npayments and administrative management. As part of its ongoing efforts to improve the social \nprotection coverage, the government will approve an increase in the coverage of benefits for \nvulnerable and poor people, such as poor mothers; and boost the volume of an open market sale \nprogram that sells subsidized food to the urban poor. \n \n21.  Reform area 2: Financial inclusion of disadvantaged people improved. Financial \ninclusion is increasingly important for overall social inclusiveness, along with the development of \nadvanced digital and financial technology. This reform area thus focuses on creating the enabling \nenvironment for broader financial inclusion by (i) establishing a national policy and strategy, \n(ii) removing policy constraints that undermine access to and availability of financial services, and \n(iii) improving policy conditions to make financial services affordable. \n \n22.  For subprogram 1, MOF approved the National Financial Inclusion Strategy\u2013Bangladesh \n(NFIS-B) for submission to the cabinet. The NFIS-B outlines the vision, road map, coordination \nmechanism, and M&E framework for financial inclusion in Bangladesh. As highlighted in the NFIS-\nB, the government promotes the use of MFS as a key tool to enhance the financial inclusion of \ndisadvantaged people. To encourage wider uptake of MFS, Bangladesh Bank adopted a system \nof interoperable transactions across all banks and MFS providers, which eases MFS transactions \nbetween operators and improves the availability of MFS for personal users. To further improve \naccess to financial services, Bangladesh Bank simplified the identification and documentation \nrequirements for opening a bank account.20 \n \n23.  The implementation of the NFIS-B involves multiple stakeholders in both the public and \nprivate sectors. To ensure effective coordination, under subprogram 2, a national NFIS-B council \nwill be established at ministerial level. The council will be chaired by the finance minister, and \nprovide the vision, strategic direction, guidance, and oversight for the implementation of the \nfinancial  inclusion  agenda.  To  broaden  the  acceptance  of  digital  payments  by  retailers, \nBangladesh Bank will issue a pricing guideline on digital payments, which will standardize and \nreduce  the  cost  for  retailers  that  accept  digital  payments.  MOF  will  improve  its  policy  on \nstandardizing MFS commission fees to boost access to MFS by social protection beneficiaries.21 \n \n24.  Reform area 3: Response to life cycle social and health needs strengthened. This \nreform area focuses on broadening the scope of protection from mere poverty relief to more \ndiversified responses to social and health needs. Building on the experience from the COVID-19 \n \n19 The procedures for notifying beneficiaries of the consolidation aspects will be built into the policies on program \nconsolidation. \n20 The government also introduced an electronic know-your-customer procedure to improve the accessibility of financial \nservices and ensure the necessary customer due diligence. \n21 Bangladesh is increasingly using the G2P electronic payment system for social protection programs, since about \n2016. For example, under the cash-transfer programs managed by the Ministry of Social Welfare, Tk6.86 billion was \ndelivered digitally as of June 2020. \n ", "7 \npandemic, the government is strengthening the health system's preparedness for infectious \ndiseases and improving the health response to urban populations. This reform area further \nsupports the development of a social insurance system based on the NSIS framework. The \ngovernment has prepared a technical study for the NSIS framework which includes an analysis \nof different types of social insurances, such as unemployment insurance and occupational injury \ninsurance. A social insurance scheme will be initially developed based on priority and feasibility, \nwhile several types of social insurance may be covered under the NSIS framework. \n \n25.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  issued  the  directive  on  the  cross-ministerial \ncoordination of preliminary actions to prepare for the selection and development of a social \ninsurance scheme based on the NSIS framework. As a key prior action, the directive informs the \nauthority  and  responsibility  of  the  MOF  for  the  cross-ministerial  coordination  and  key \nadministrative actions to be conducted before selecting a type of social insurance and its \ninsurance scheme. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) approved the policy \nguideline on public health and medical research to strengthen the preparedness of the national \nhealth system. This ensures the proper coordination of research into and response to infectious \ndiseases, including epidemics and pandemics, with corresponding budget allocations. This policy \nis to improve the evidence-based policy development for strengthening health response and \npreparedness. The MOHFW also approved the National Urban Health Strategy (NUHS), which \nprovides a framework to strengthen urban health care services in line with the growing health \nneeds of urban populations.  \n \n26.  Under subprogram 2, the government will define a type of social insurance and its scheme \nto be developed as an initial national social insurance scheme, in Bangladesh. The government \nwill also approve the new action plan of the NSSS (2021\u20132026), which includes a national reform \nplan,  and  a  framework  of  reform  activities  to  be  accomplished  by  line  ministries.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the government will also approve the new action plan of the NSSS (2021\u20132026), \nwhich includes a framework of reform activities to be accomplished by line ministries. To improve \nthe response to urban health needs, the Urban Health Coordination Committee will be reformed \nby  redefining  its  authority,  responsibility,  and  coordination  mechanism  for  overseeing  and \nsupervising the cross-ministerial coordination efforts in accordance with the approved NUHS. The \nMOHFW will also implement a program to improve the capacity of the government\u2019s urban health \nfacilities, such as urban dispensaries,22 and provision of services. \n \n27.  Post-program  partnership  framework.  The  post-program  partnership  framework \n(PPPF) has been formulated to further strengthen the sustainability of the reforms initiated under \nthe program. The PPPF will particularly focus on evaluating improvements concerning the \nfragmentation of social protection programs, the level of financial inclusion, and the progress of \nsocial insurance development; this will help the government achieve the desired medium-term \nreform impacts. ADB will continue close policy dialogue with the government and supports its \nreform efforts under the PPPF. With regard to reform area 1, the PPPF will focus on the progress \nmade in (i) consolidating the social protection programs, (ii) improving the administration of the \nprograms with MISs, and (iii) increasing the coverage of social protection. As regards reform area \n2, the PPPF will evaluate the improvements made in the availability and usability of MFS, \ndisaggregated by sex, and urban and rural population. As regards reform area 3, it will monitor \nthe preparation and launch of a pilot national social insurance scheme. Activities under the \nattached TA will be aligned with the PPPF. \n \n \n22 An urban dispensary is a type of urban health service provide in Bangladesh.  \n ", "8 \n28.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  and  lessons.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2020  required \nimmediate action to meet urgent health, social, and financial needs. Aligned with the stimulus \npolicy of the Government of Bangladesh and as an integral part of the National Preparedness and \nResponse Plan, ADB provided immediate financial support to help mitigate the impacts of the \npandemic with a focus on social safety nets and job security.23 ADB also supported urgent \nlogistical and systemic needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.24 In addition, ADB continued \nits assistance to better urban health outcomes in Bangladesh by focusing on the accessibility, \nquality, and use of urban primary health care services.25 \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s experiences confirm the importance of strong and high-level government ownership \nand commitment to tackling the cross-sector and cross-ministerial issues of social development. \nThe coordination of multiple stakeholders and a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities are \ncrucial to improving social and health responses sustainably.26 It is also important to strengthen \npublic awareness and knowledge of available services and how to access them, to attain the \nreform impacts. Moreover, the reform process needs to be reasonably flexible to accommodate \na longer-term horizon of social and health development, which makes a programmatic approach \na suitable tool to support the government\u2019s medium- and long-term efforts.27 \n \n30.  Building on its assistance to an inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the \nongoing engagement in the country\u2019s health sector, ADB engaged in a comprehensive policy \ndialogue with the government on social protection. This resulted in key contributions to the design \nof the government-owned policy packages, such as (i) recognizing the potential of digital and \nfinancial technologies to reduce financial exclusion and further enhance inclusive development, \n(ii) taking a life cycle approach to meeting the diversified social needs, and (iii) acknowledging the \nnecessity of health response and preparedness as a requisite for social resilience. ADB will further \nstrengthen its support by providing attached TA (paras. 38\u201339) on (i) evidence-based M&E of \nreforms, (ii) market analysis of MFS usability, (iii) harmonization of social protection programs, \nand (iv) development of a national social insurance scheme. \n \n31.  Development coordination. Major development partners supporting social protection in \nBangladesh are the United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP); the World Bank; and the Government of \nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. UNDP helped the General Economics \nDivision of the Planning Commission to formulate the NSSS; and through a TA program (Social \nSecurity Policy Support Program), Australia, the United Kingdom, and UNDP assisted the General \nEconomics Division in rolling out the activities under the NSSS. The World Bank supports the \ninstitutional strengthening of ministries and the G2P payment system, and also finances part of \nthe  costs  of  major  social  protection  schemes,  such  as  a  cash  transfer  program,  and  the \n \n23 ADB. 2020.

ADB closely coordinates with development partners in supporting the government to \nmeet its development needs and is also in close and regular contact with the IMF. The program \ncomplements the efforts of development partners by focusing on medium-term institutional and \npolicy reforms to better manage cross-sectoral issues of social development, while at the same \ntime responding to financial needs. \n \n32.  Some key areas for further coordination with development partners will be the digital \npayment of social protection benefits, and the digital and financial literacy of poor and vulnerable \npeople. Also, developing the NSIS is a core longer-term agenda. ADB will keep communicating \nand  coordinating  with  major  development  partners  to  help  attain  the  objectives  of  social \ndevelopment in Bangladesh. \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n33.  Bangladesh\u2019s overarching development objective is to strengthen the social resilience of \nits  people.  Aligned  with  that  objective,  the  reforms'  outcome  will  be  inclusiveness  and \nresponsiveness of social development improved. Inclusiveness will be supported with policy \nactions under reform area 1, i.e., by expanding the coverage of social protection beneficiaries in \n150 poverty-stricken upazilas, with a particular focus on poor women and elderly people. Policy \nactions under reform area 2 will also improve the enabling environment for financial inclusion and \nease access to financial services for the disadvantaged population. Better efficiency will be \nachieved by streamlining and consolidating the social protection programs, and by standardizing \nand  integrating  the  administration  of  the  social  protection  system.  Responsiveness  will  be \nimproved by strengthening the country's preparedness for infectious diseases and its response \nto health needs of urban populations. Responsiveness will be further strengthened by broadening \nthe scope of social protection, particularly by establishing the NSIS. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n34.  The Bangladesh economy is recovering from the negative impacts of the COVID-19 \npandemic by the introduction of stimulus packages totaling $15.1 billion as of May 2021. The \nCOVID-19 pandemic widened the fiscal deficit. ADB estimates that the annual fiscal deficit will \nreach $22.3 billion in FY2021 and $23.9 billion in FY2022.29 Both domestic and external sources \nare used to finance the budget deficits. Domestic source is the major source to fill the deficits. \nThe government targets to finance about 68% of deficits in FY2021 and 63% in FY2022. External \nsources are expected to fill about $7.1 billion in FY2021 and $8.8 billion in FY2022. The \ngovernment has received budget support totaling $1 billion from ADB, the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank, and the World Bank in FY2020. Balance-of-payment support totaling $732 \nmillion has received from the IMF. \n \n35.  To finance economic and social development needs in face of widening fiscal deficit, \nadditional development financing is required. The proposed program considers the government\u2019s \nfinancing needs, the availability of alternative financing, including the estimated financial support \n \n28 World Bank also provides financial support for the employment generation program for the poorest which is a \nworkfare program for the poorest in rural areas. \n29 ADB. 2021.

The government requested $500 million \nin financial assistance in the form of a programmatic approach, comprising two subprograms \nworth $250 million each, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \n36.  To help finance subprogram 1, the government requested a regular loan of $250 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n37.  The Finance Division of MOF is the executing agency. The implementing agencies are the \nCabinet  Division, MOHFW,  MSW,  and  Bangladesh  Bank.  To further strengthen  the  cross-\nministerial coordination of the program's implementation, a steering committee was set up, led by \nthe senior secretary of MOF's Finance Division and comprising representatives from the Cabinet \nDivision, MOF's Financial Institutions Division, MSW, Health Services Division, Medical Education \nand Family Welfare Division, Local Government Division, Bangladesh Bank, Directorate General \nof Health Services, Department of Social Services, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, \nand Ministry of Women and Child Affairs. The implementation period will be from July 2020 to \nJune 2021 for subprogram 1, and from July 2021 to June 2022 for subprogram 2.30 Each \nsubprogram has a single tranche for disbursement. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be \nwithdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n38.  A TA attached to the program will support its implementation, technical analyses, and \ncapacity development for key ministries.31 ADB will administer the TA. MOF will be the executing \nagency. The Cabinet Division, Bangladesh Bank, and the MOHFW will be the implementing \nagencies. The TA will help (i) carry out the evidence-based M&E of the reforms supported by the \nprogram;  (ii) strengthen  the  capacity  for  developing  policies  that  ensure  sustainable  social \ninclusiveness  and  responsiveness,  and  (iii) improve  people's  awareness  of  inclusive  and \nresponsive social protection. \n \n39.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,258,000, of which $1,200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, assistance in arranging meetings with related agencies, and other \nin-kind contributions. TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). All consultants shall be recruited \nin accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nassociated staff instructions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n40.  Safeguards. The due diligence identified no environmental, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous people impacts as defined by the safeguards assessment matrix of ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  The  policy  actions  were  assessed  and  will  not  lead  to  adverse \n \n30 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nenvironmental and social impacts. The program will support policy actions that will improve the \ninclusiveness and responsiveness of social development in Bangladesh. Thus, the program is \ncategorized C for environmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people safeguards. \nInvestment activities prohibited under the Safeguard Policy Statement will be excluded. \n \n41.  Economic. The reforms supported by the program will be instrumental in achieving the \ncountry's inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and continue the efforts made toward \nsustainable  development.  The  reforms  will  improve  the  efficiency  and  coverage  of  social \nprotection, and lower the risks faced by the poor and vulnerable. The transmission channels \ninclude addressing administrative inefficiencies, promoting a more responsive distribution of \navailable financial and health-related benefits, and strengthening the financial inclusion of the \npoor and disadvantaged. International evidence suggests potentially significant benefits from \nproductivity and efficiency savings, avoidable costs, and poverty reduction. Further, reinvesting \nthe savings from reduced administration costs in social protection and health preparedness \nsystems will lead to greater financial sustainability, coordination, and efficiency, which in turn will \nmitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and help avoid future economic and social \nlosses. \n \n42.  Poverty. Although Bangladesh substantially reduced its poverty incidence from 48.9% in \n2000 to 20.5% in 2019, it still has a significant number of vulnerable groups. Vulnerable groups \nare generally defined as those experiencing situational disadvantage, at risk of falling below the \npoverty line in the face of adverse shocks and circumstances that reduce their income-earning \nand livelihood prospects. Bangladesh defines vulnerable groups as those who live above the \nnational poverty line but below an income level of 1.25 times the national poverty line. These \ngroups are estimated to account for 40% of the population, including poor and vulnerable people, \nbased on the 2016 HIES. The program will help improve the coverage and efficiency of social \nprotection, with a positive impact on the poor and vulnerable, including elderly people and widows. \nIt will broaden access to financial services for the poor and vulnerable through wider use of MFS. \nIt will also improve urban health care services and thus provide more support to poor and \nvulnerable urban residents. \n \n43.  Gender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Social protection is \na critical driver of poverty reduction because it offers the potential to minimize gender inequalities \nand  intersectional  dimensions  of  exclusion  and  vulnerability  based  on  old  age,  disability, \ngeographic location, and income status. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated \nmobility restrictions, women in urban areas have experienced additional stress, anxiety, and fear, \nas well as more violence. The program will expand its outreach to excluded and vulnerable women \nby increasing the coverage of both the old age allowance (benefiting women over 62) and the \nallowance for widowed, deserted, and destitute women in 150 upazilas. The program will enhance \nthe financial inclusion of disadvantaged people by enabling broader access to digital financial \nservices, giving particular attention to the gender gap in financial inclusion and the needs voiced \nby vulnerable women and groups. It will support the approval of the NUHS to strengthen health \ncare services for urban populations, taking into account their gender-specific needs. The program \nwill also improve the management of social protection with an MIS capable of producing sex-\ndisaggregated data on social protection benefits and providing the tools to obtain quantitative data \nand analyses of poverty and gender-related aspects. \n \n44.  Governance.  Public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessments  for \nBangladesh were carried out in 2006, 2010, and 2016. The country has made progress in \ndeveloping its public financial management system with effective fiscal measures since the 2010 \nassessment.  However,  it  is  necessary  to  further  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  for \n ", "12 \nimplementing public financial management reforms and to strengthen the capacity of oversight \ninstitutions such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh (OCAG). \nImprovements are particularly necessary in the areas of internal and external audits. In principle, \nOCAG is an independent institution. However, it still requires more capacity enhancements to \nfully exercise its oversight functions. Inadequate human resources are causing significant delays \nin submitting external audit reports to the Parliament, and in following up on the audit findings. \nADB is providing capacity-building support to OCAG for the provision of training to audit staff, and \nfor the development of an audit manual for foreign-aided projects.32 On the plus side, MOF's major \nrole in budget management contributed to the country\u2019s strong record of fiscal discipline. \n \n45.  Bangladesh has most of the formal legislation in place to be compliant with the United \nNations Convention against Corruption. However, Transparency International indicates that the \ncountry\u2019s  performance  in  anticorruption  efforts  is  mixed,  and  the  improvement  in  score  is \ninsignificant. A major challenge is the effectiveness deficit of the Anti-Corruption Commission. \nThe commission needs to come up with a strategy to develop institutional capacity and trust. \n \n46.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin the table and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 \n \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19)  The government has introduced strong stimulus and \nimpacts are prolonged and more severe  mitigation measures, such as (i) an increase in public \nthan expected, which exacerbates the  expenditures, (ii) fiscal stimulus, (iii) expanded social safety \nsituation of poor and vulnerable people.  net programs, and (iv) an increase in money supply.
