THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Garadagh Cement Open Joint Stock Company for the Garadagh Cement Expansion and \nEnergy Efficiency Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  Through discussions with Holcim Limited (the parent company of the sponsor), the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  the  project.  In  2008,  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD), a minority shareholder in Garadagh Cement, was \nmandated as senior debt arranger.  EBRD approached ADB for the remaining parallel senior \ntranche. \n  \n3.  There are limited private sector investment opportunities in Azerbaijan outside of the \noil and gas sector, and the project represents the first opportunity for ADB to provide direct \nassistance  to  Azerbaijan's  private  sector  economy  in  an  industry  that  directly  supports \ninfrastructure development. ADB's participation in this project will complement the EBRD's \nassistance and catalyze more private sector investment in Azerbaijan's infrastructure sector \nby  highlighting  attractive  investments  outside of  the  oil  and gas sector.  A  private  sector \nsolution to cement supply is ideal since consumer prices are driven by production costs, and \nprivate  enterprises,  which  compete for market  share  by  reducing  costs,  can  expand  the \nmarket supply. \n \nB.  Sector Background \n4.  Between 2005 and 2008, Azerbaijan's economy was one of the fastest growing in the \nworld, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimated at 10.8%.1 Net exports, primarily oil \nand gas, are the major drivers of growth; however, inward investment contributed a significant \n19% of GDP in 2008. Signs of economic recovery have emerged, with a per annum GDP \ngrowth rate in 2009 of an impressive 9.3%, a much stronger result than Azerbaijan's peers in \nthe region. GDP growth of 7.4% is expected in 2010.2 This performance reflects a recovery in oil \nprices  and  improved  global  economic  output.  Despite  some  recent  cuts,  overall  budget \nexpenditures\u2014in particular for infrastructure and social spending\u2014have increased as a result of \nthe Government of Azerbaijan's crisis response, resulting in an estimated budget deficit of 2% in \nthe first half of 2009.3 \n \n5.  This investment growth was led by construction, which expanded by 36% during 2009, \nmostly through increases in secondary-town and rural infrastructure, residential and commercial \nbuilding construction, and transportation infrastructure. Although the government intends to \nreduce investment spending in the medium term, the 2009 budget moderately increased capital \ninvestment in roads, urban infrastructure, water supply, and sanitation. This public investment \nwill  become  the  single-largest  source  of  GDP  growth,  accounting  for  about  60%  of  total \ninvestments (footnote 2). Though the domestic economy is growing strongly, overall reliance on \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. Asian Development Outlook 2009. Manila. \n2  Standard & Poor's. 2010. Azerbaijan (Republic of). London (March). \n3  EBRD. 2009. Transition Report, 2009. London. \n ", "2   \n \nimports grew at 19.4% in 2008, led by increased public spending for infrastructure refurbishment \nrequiring substantial imports of machinery, equipment, and construction materials.  \n \n6.  Emphasis on infrastructure refurbishment and general construction has fuelled strong \ngrowth in cement consumption, averaging a 15% compounded annual growth rate from 2004 to \n2008.4 Azerbaijan's recent boom in oil and gas exports has driven substantial investment in \npublic  and  private  sector  construction,  which  had  been  neglected  during  many  years  of \nunderinvestment.  The  main  drivers  for  cement  consumption  include  ongoing  demand  for \nresidential and commercial construction, which lags far behind eastern Europe and the Russian \nFederation in terms of interior area per occupant, and increased government spending for \ninfrastructure, which is expected to increase to 35% of total domestic construction spending by \n2011 (footnote 3). However, due to the global crisis, there was a reduction in demand in late \n2008 and 2009, which affected near-term growth assumptions and demand. Several public and \nprivate projects in the planning and development phase may have been put on hold, but \nconstruction on those projects already under way continued.  \n \n7.  In 2008, domestic cement consumption in Azerbaijan was 3.2 million tons, representing \n374 kilograms (kg) per capita. This compares similarly with per capita consumption in Eastern \nEurope but is considerably less than in other countries in the region undergoing significant \nconstruction and infrastructure rehabilitation, such as Kazakhstan (608 kg per capita), Iran (475 \nkg per capita), and the Russian Federation (420 kg per capita). The total installed cement \ncapacity in Azerbaijan, consisting of a cement plant and grinding stations, left a supply deficit of \n1.27 million tons in 2008, increasing the country's dependence on imports. Based on GDP per \ncapita growth trends, cement consumption is expected to grow by 5.8% per year up to 2012, \nleading to a consumption rate of 505 kg per capita (footnote 2), a rate more in line with \nbenchmarks  in  similar  countries.  Appendix  4  contains  a  more  thorough  description  of  the \ncement industry and the key drivers. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n8.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  private  sector  development  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2020.5 This  financing  supports  the  expansion  and  energy  efficiency  upgrading  of \nAzerbaijan's  first  privatized  integrated  cement  manufacturer.  It  promotes  environmentally \nsustainable growth by facilitating the transfer of modern technology to a developing member \ncountry, improving production capacity, and reducing environmental impacts such as carbon \nemission  intensity,  particulate  matter  and  nitrous  oxides  (NO )  emissions,  and  wastewater \nx\ndischarge. The  project's  energy  efficiency  improvements  also  contribute  to  environmentally \nsustainable growth to arrest climate change in the region. ADB is working with the EBRD on this \nprivate  sector  transaction,  broadening  its  partnerships  with  key  development  agencies  in \ndeveloping  member  countries  beyond  the  official  development  assistance  window.  This  is \nconsistent with two of the drivers of change\u2014private sector operations and partnerships\u2014as \ndescribed in Strategy 2020 for ADB to be a better and more active development partner. \n  \n                                                \n4  Garadagh Cement. 2009.

Consistency with the Country Strategy \n9.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Azerbaijan \n(last updated in 2006), which emphasizes promoting economic growth outside of the oil and gas \nsector.6 The project, through its supply of crucial cement products to large local contractors \n(mainly in transportation, commercial development, and urban development) also supports the \nCSP's emphasis on strengthening the transport and urban development sectors. The CSP also \naims to achieve close cooperation with the EBRD in Azerbaijan. Once approved, this will be \nADB's first nonsovereign infrastructure financing in Azerbaijan. \n \n3.  Consistency with the Energy Policy \n10.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,7 which  advocates  technology \ntransfer in energy efficiency projects, thus consistent with Holcim's role as both foreign direct \ninvestor and technology enabler. Through this transfer of modern dry kiln technology, the project \nserves as a demonstration project for the Caucasus and Central Asia and contributes to a \nreduction  in  fuel  consumption  per  ton  of  cement  produced.  However,  because  of  the \ngovernment's new domestic natural gas pricing policy,8 Garadagh Cement is likely to eventually \nswitch (or dual fire) from natural gas to domestic petroleum coke (petcoke) or imported coal. \nThe coal ash is incorporated into the clinker, and therefore the clinker factor will remain nearly \nthe same. The coal has the effect that the ash substitutes part of the clay as raw material, and \nthe raw mix will be slightly adjusted to consider the coal ash. With petcoke, the ash content is \nvery low and these ash effects are even smaller. The differences in energy (megajoules per ton) \nbetween natural gas and coal or petcoke are small. The new gas pricing regime intends to \nmatch the value of export demand with the country's abundant natural gas supply. The project \nalso employs state-of-the-art baghouse filtration and low NO  burners to substantially reduce air \nx\nemissions  and  effluent  discharge  below  current  levels  and  achieve  compliance  with  the \nEuropean  Union,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  industry \nbenchmarks. \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n1.  The Borrower and Sponsor \n11.  The  borrower,  Garadagh  Cement  is  majority  owned  by  Holcim  Limited,  the  world's \nlargest  suppliers  of  cement  and  aggregates,  based  in  Zurich,  Switzerland  (Appendix  3).9 \nGaradagh Cement operates the only integrated clinker and grinding cement plant in Azerbaijan \nwith cement sales of 1.15 million tons in 2009. The remainder of the market share is held by \nlocal grinding stations (using imported clinker mainly from Georgia and Turkey) and by cement \nimports from Georgia, Iran, the Russian Federation, Turkey, and other Central Asian countries. \nThe project will increase clinker capacity from 2,616 tons per day (TPD) to 4,000 TPD, replace \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2006. Azerbaijan: Country Strategy and Program Update, 2005\u20132006. Manila. \n7   ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n8  The Government of Azerbaijan increased natural gas prices by 112% in 2007 to reflect international market prices. \nA similarly large price increase is expected in 2009, which could amount to as much as 267% as the State Oil \nCompany of Azerbaijan attempts to equalize Azeri natural gas prices to its primary export markets in Turkey and \nGeorgia (Source: United Press International. 11 August 2009). \n9  Shares of the company are owned by both Holcim Limited and Holcim Auslandbeteiligungs, one of its intermediary \nholding companies incorporated in Germany.  \n ", "4   \n \nthe existing four wet-type kilns with one new modern dry-type kiln, and raise annual production \nof cement from 1.3 million tons per annum (TPA) to 1.7 million TPA. At the same time, the more \nenergy efficient dry kiln will reduce the specific fuel consumption. \n \n12.  In addition to being the only integrated clinker-to-cement producer, Garadagh Cement \nhas unique advantages over domestic competitors in that it owns substantial reserves of raw \nmaterials. Garadagh Cement has secured access to three sources of limestone, one of the key \nraw materials for clinker production. The first source is limestone waste from an adjacent stone \ncutting operation, which currently supplies the majority of Garadagh Cement's limestoneThe \nsecond source is extracting limestone at the currently dormant Shakhgaya-West quarry, owned \nby Garadagh Cement. The scope of the project includes recommissioning this quarry and \ntransporting  limestone  to  the  cement  plant  by  rehabilitating  an  existing  15-kilometer  (km) \ndedicated rail line. The third source is to develop another quarry owned by Garadagh Cement at \nCaravan Sarai adjacent to the Shakhgaya-West quarry. Clay, the other key raw material for \nclinker production, is sourced from a clay and shale and owned by Garadagh Cement.  \n  \n13.  Competitive  benchmarking  conducted  by  AC  Nielsen  in  2008  found  that  Garadagh \nCement  has  100%  brand  awareness  in  its  geographical  markets  and  a  marketing \neffectiveness10 in the Baku region of 94%, compared with 20%\u201360% for its top four competitors. \nSales  staff  are  trained  through  four  modules  each  year  on  selling  the  right  cement  (and \nstrength) for the right application to customers and substantiating Garadagh Cement's price \npremium. The company holds technical seminars for contractors on the benefit of its sulfate-\nresistant cement, which is ideal to combat the aggressive climatic conditions that result from the \nhigh salinity of the Caspian Sea. More details on the sponsor can be found in Appendix 3, and \non Garadagh Cement in Appendix 4. \n \n2.  Project Design \n14.  The project scope consists of a new five-stage precalciner preheater, a rotary dry kiln \nwith modern grate cooler, a vertical roller mill, upgrades to three cement mills, reopening of a \nnearby limestone quarry, and new cement storage facilities and associated plant infrastructure \n(Table 1). The cement mills are relatively simple ball mill devices consisting of a steel vessel, \nsteel mill balls, and electric motor drives; with regular maintenance and periodic efficiency \nimprovements they can be operated over the long-term. The kiln system of the project will be \nconstructed by CBMI Construction Company (CBMI) under a fixed-price turnkey engineering, \nprocurement, and construction (EPC) contract which was awarded through competitive bidding. \nA number of key components will be supplied by European suppliers with interfacing facilitated \nby the Holcim Group Services (HGRS) team based in Switzerland. Project scope outside of the \nkiln system, including the dedicated rail line rehabilitation, quarry crusher facilities, cement mill \nupgrades, and office building upgrades, are contracted directly by Garadagh Cement to local \ncontractors. \nTable 1: Project Scope \nProcess Step  Location  Description \nRaw material extraction  Shakhgaya West  Mobile equipment, limestone crushing plant, and \nQuarry  rail loading station; rail and road refurbishment \nfrom the quarry to main plant\n \n                                                \n10  Marketing effectiveness is a composite score indicating the company's performance in a range of categories \nincluding the number of customers who are recommenders, price premium, social responsibility, advertising \neffectiveness, perceived competence, safety, product quality, and delivery. \n ", "  5 \nRaw material preparation  Plant site production  Rail unloading station; preblending and storage \narea  halls for 24,000 tons of limestone, 2x3,600 tons of \nclay, and 2x600 tons of iron correctives\n \nRaw meal preparation  Plant site production  Vertical roller mill with 8,000 ton homogenizing \narea  silo\n \nClinker production  Plant site production  4,000 ton/day coal-fired dry kiln with a single \narea  string five-stage precalciner preheater, emissions \ncontrol equipment, and 75,000 ton clinker storage\n \nCement production  Product dispatch  Upgrade of three cement mills to closed circuit \narea  and replacement of nine cement mill drives; \n16,000 ton multicell cement silo and two bulk truck \nloaders\n \nFuels handling  Plant storage area  Solid fuel storage hall for 5,000 tons of coal and/or \n    5,000 tons of petcoke; vertical roller mill for \n  grinding 26 tons/hour of coal or 21 tons/hour of \n  petcoke \nSource: Garadagh Cement. \n \n15.  The  total  cost  of  the  project  including  contingencies  is  \u20ac325  million  ($442  million \nequivalent), of which the sponsor is contributing 57%, or \u20ac185 million ($251 million equivalent), \nas equity, sourced mostly by cash flow from operations and subordinated debt from Holcim.  \n \n16.  The project provides substantial energy efficiency gains by switching clinker production \nfrom wet to dry process and reducing fuel consumption. However, electricity consumption will \nslightly increase by replacing the wet process slurry preparation with raw materials grinding, \nwhich requires more electrical energy. Overall average electricity consumption will increase by \n19% from 61.2 kWh per ton of clinker to 72.8 kWh, and will be supplied by a new 80,000 \nkilovolt-ampere (kVA) substation installed and commissioned by Garadagh Cement in 2009 to \nstep down power from the 11 kilovolt (kV) utility distribution line to the dry kiln and existing 4,160 \nkV cement plant circuit.  \n \n17.  In accordance with Holcim corporate environmental objectives, the project has been \ndesigned to also be able to use alternative fuel resources to fire the kiln.  \n \n3.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n18.  The project outputs will be 4,000 tons per day (1.24 million TPA) of clinker production by \nthe end of the second quarter of 2011, yielding 1.7 millions TPA of cement, and a decrease in \nspecific fuel consumption per unit of clinker produced. The expansion, upgrade, and operation \nof the project will be in compliance with ADB and EBRD environmental and social safeguards. \n \n19.  The project outcome will be an expanded and more efficient domestic cement supply \nindicated by reduced per-unit fuel consumption, increased domestic cement supply from 1.3 \nmillion TPA to 1.7 million TPA, the creation of jobs during construction, and upgrading of skills \nfor operating staff. Beyond the stated outcome, the project will also demonstrate that Azerbaijan \nis conducive to foreign direct investment and privatization of major state-owned enterprises \noutside of the oil and gas sector. \n \n ", "6   \n \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n20.  The project will achieve significant energy savings through the use of sustainable and \nenvironmentally friendly dry kiln technology, resulting in a reduction in energy use per unit of \nclinker produced. Dry kiln technology will be transferred from a developed economy and the \nskills of local operations staff will be upgraded so they are trained to operate a state-of-the-art \nproduction  facility.  Supply  of  high-quality  indigenous  cement  will  support  the  government's \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  (specifically  roads,  bridges,  ports,  and  water  supply).  The \ngovernment has indicated capital expenditure plans of $3.7 billion for infrastructure projects in \n2010. Many of these projects are intended to support agribusiness, trade, tourism, and regional \nintegration so that the economy diversifies its sources of growth outside of the oil and gas \nsector. \n \n2.

The  assistance  of  ADB  and  the  EBRD  facilitates  foreign  direct  investment  by  an \ninternational  sponsor  with  the  highest  corporate  governance  standards,  and  the  project \npromotes private sector participation outside of the country's dominant oil and gas sector. The \nproject  ensures  a  sustainable  local  supply  of  high-quality  cement,  which  will  support  the \ngovernment's investments in the transport, water, and urban infrastructure sectors and other \ncommercial development, including tourism.  \n \n22.  The  assistance  is  aligned  with  the private  sector  development goals of  one  of the \ncompany's  shareholders,  Azerbaijan  Investment  Company,  which  is  mandated  by  the \nAzerbaijan Ministry of Economic Development to develop the private sector outside of the oil \nand gas sector in order to enhance the country's long-term sustainability. This diversification is \ncritical to promoting inclusive growth and reducing poverty in Azerbaijan. \n \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environment \n23.  ADB has classified the project as environmental category A, and the borrower has \nconducted a full environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA). The ESIA was posted on \nthe company's website11 on 19 November 2008 and the full document was reposted on ADB's \nwebsite on 19 December 2009 as per the requirements of ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.12 \nHard copies in Azeri were supplied to the settlements of Sahil and Umid and the EBRD resident \noffice in Baku. A local consulting company prepared an environmental impact assessment for \napplication  to  the  Azerbaijan  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Natural  Resources  for  environmental \napproval.  \n \n24.  The ESIA report contains detailed findings of likely environmental and social impacts \nassociated with the operation and maintenance of the project. The ESIA has established an \nenvironmental and social management plan (ESMP), setting forth avoidance and mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring for identified impacts. Despite a substantial increase in production \ncapacity, and the likely switch from gas to coal, the project will have a reduced net air impact \n                                                \n11    http://www.garadagh.com \n12    ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. \n ", "  7 \ncompared to the existing plant in terms of NO  and particular matter. Results from the dispersion \nx\nmodel show no further mitigation measures are required to reduce stack emissions beyond the \nuse of low NO  burners and high-efficiency bag filters for particular matter, as designed. The \nx\nmodeling predicts that the emissions will meet the applicable emission and ambient air quality \nlevels laid out in the national standards and in the World Bank's Environment, Health and Safety \nguidelines. \n \n25.  Total carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions from production will increase from 0.74 million \n2\nTPA to 1.04 million TPA. However, emissions intensity (CO emissions per ton of cement) will \n2 \ndecrease by 4% on a gross emissions basis and 1% on a net emissions basis, from 594 kg per \nton of cement for the gas-fired wet kiln process to 587 kg per ton of cement for the coal-fired dry \nkiln process. Though the project is switching to a more carbon-intensive fuel for economic \nreasons, carbon emissions are being reduced through energy efficiency and reduced clinker \nfactor (using fly ash from coal combustion in cement, which reduces the proportion of clinker in \nthe final cement product) as compared to operation of the four wet kilns for the same production \ncapacity. NO  emissions are less than 500 milligrams (mg) per ton. The wet kilns will be \nx\ndecommissioned no later than 2 years from commercial operation of the dry kiln.13  \n \n26.  The existing wet kiln process uses a substantial amount of water (600,000 cubic meters \n[m3] per year) for production. The dry kiln will consume 65% less water compared to the existing \noperation. While the present operation uses treated wastewater, the use of fresh water from the \nmain pipeline will be necessary. However, a water-saving, closed water cycle is planned for \nproduction. The wastewater discharge will be reduced by about 56% compared to the present \noperation.  Effluent  from  the  project  will  be  treated  at  a  new  on-site  treatment  plant  to \ninternational  effluent  standards.  Further  details  on  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation \nmeasures are described in the ESIA in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n27.  In 2003, the company implemented an environmental management system according to \nISO 14001 in parallel with the ISO 9001 quality management system. The company has a unit \nfor operational health and safety and environmental and security issues. The plant runs an \nestablished occupational health and safety management system in line with Holcim's corporate \npolicy.  Clear  organizational  accountabilities  are  supporting  by  a  program  of  training, \ncommunication, strict procedural discipline, and locally developed policies and action plans. \n \n28.  The existing occupational health and safety system will be transferred to the operation of \nkiln 6, including the quarry activities. In addition, the project will implement an ESMP which \nincludes management and monitoring activities to address issues and mitigate impacts. Overall \nresponsibility for the implementation of the ESMP lies with Garadagh Cement for all project \nphases, including compliance by all contractors. Special awareness training will be provided for \nemployees  working  with  new  or  modified  equipment  relating  to  the  dry  kiln.  Semiannual \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to the senior lenders during construction in line with ADB's \nrequirements, and annual reports will be submitted thereafter (including details on greenhouse \ngas emissions). The reports shall cover all aspects of environmental, health, and safety-related \naspects such as permits, status of compliance with obligations, and any corrective measures \nrequired. \n \n                                                \n13  Failure to comply with this covenant will result in an event of default in the EBRD loan agreement. This shall be \nreplicated in ADB's loan covenants. \n ", "8   \n \n2.  Social Dimensions \n29.  As described in the ESIA, no land acquisition is required for the project, other than a few \ndiscontinuous parcels of government land adjacent to the plant boundary wall.14 The new dry \nkiln will be built within the Garadagh Cement plant premises (approximately 52 hectares) and all \nland is owned by Garadagh Cement. Due to the arid conditions, there is no notable agricultural \nuse, except small-scale herding of goats and sheep. The reopening of the Shakhgaya-West \nlimestone quarry results in no land use impacts since the area comprises arid land, which is \nneither under permanent nor temporary use. The rail and road infrastructure to be rehabilitated \nremain in the same alignment and also require no additional land. There are two settlements \nwithin the vicinity of the cement plant: Sahil and Umid. Sahil settlement (population 22,700) was \nestablished originally as a workers\u2019 settlement for the cement plant during the Soviet period. It \nhas grown into a highly industrial and commercial town, and the proportion of Garadagh Cement \nemployees in the total population of Sahil is relatively low. Umid settlement (population 2,000) is \ncomprised mainly (75%) of internally displaced persons from the Nagorno\u2013Karabagh conflict. \nThe Umid population has expressed its expectation for project-related employment opportunities \n(more than 60% of the peak construction workforce of 700\u2013900 persons will be locally hired). \nGaradagh Cement has indicated it will facilitate this by promptly communicating employment \nopportunities to Sahil, Umid, and the region.  \n \n30.  Based on the findings of the ESIA, and verified by ADB during transaction review, the \nproject is classified C in respect of ADB's involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \npolicies. In June 2008, public meetings were held in the villages of Sahil and Umid where \nattendees expressed enthusiasm for energy efficiency upgrades but expressed concern about \nfuture airborne pollution due to the increase in production capacity and the fuel switch from \nnatural gas to coal.15 Garadagh Cement has an established public consultation and disclosure \nplan and has made project documents and grievance forms available to stakeholders and the \npublic (footnote 12). On 17\u201318 December 2008, further consultation was carried out on the draft \nfinal ESIA, with project staff available to directly answer questions and provide additional project \nliterature (ESIA, project pamphlet, posters with simulated pictures of the expansion, and results \nof  dispersion  calculations)  and  no  additional  major  issues  were  raised  by  the  public  and \nstakeholders.  Garadagh  Cement  will  nominate  a  community  liaison  officer  responsible  for \ncontinuing  communications  with  the  public  during  construction  and  operation.  Garadagh \nCement will also implement a grievance mechanism where the community liaison officer will be \nresponsible for recording and responding to grievances. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n31.  The  company  has  signed  an  EPC  contract  with  CBMI  for  turnkey  delivery  of  the \nexpanded and upgraded clinker and cement plant. Project scope components outside of the \nclinker and cement plant will be contracted and managed directly by the company and Holcim \nwith local contractors. The project is currently under way and approximately \u20ac53 million has \nalready been spent on EPC mobilization and other upfront equipment costs. Total cost of the \nproject is \u20ac325 million. \n                                                \n14  Due diligence has confirmed there are no affected persons permanently or temporarily settled on this land, and \nthe land has no productive uses. \n15  Garadagh Cement. 2008. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment: Garadagh Cement Project New Dry Kiln \n6. Baku.  The project's environmental impact assessment report indicates that the project will achieve airborne \nemissions concentrations of less than 30 mg per normal cubic meter (Nm3) of particulates, less than 500 mg/Nm3 \nNO, and 200 mg/Nm3 of sulfur dioxide, which are all substantially less than the existing wet kiln emissions and \nx\nwithin the European Union and International Finance Corporation benchmarks. \n ", "  9 \n \n32.  The sponsor proposes to finance the project at a debt\u2013equity ratio of approximately \n40:60. The sponsor's contribution of \u20ac185 million is to be funded by cash flow from operations of \nthe existing Garadagh Cement business and subordinated debt from Holcim Limited (Table 2). \nPre-project capital costs and costs incurred before financial close in excess of the \u20ac50 million \nsubordinated debt estimate will be covered by additional short-term shareholder loans from \nHolcim and repaid when the senior debt instruments are disbursed.  \n \n33.  The debt will consist of three unsecured tranches of senior euro loans, all by multilateral \ndevelopment banks (Table 2). The EBRD tranche 1 and the ADB tranche are fully amortizing 6-\nyear door-to-door tenor loans.16 EBRD tranche 2 was originally structured as a B-loan but was \nconverted to a second direct loan tranche when the commercial lenders exited the transaction \ndue to the global financial crisis. The tranche, which the sponsor had already structured within \nits capital plan, has a slightly shorter (5 years) door-to-door tenor. In addition to funds generated \nby existing operations, the sponsor will provide \u20ac50 million of subordinated debt, \u20ac30 million of \nwhich will be injected prior to the drawdown of any senior loans. In addition, Holcim has agreed \nto provide a \u20ac30 million contingent subordinated loan in the event of construction cost overrun \nor funding shortfall. In total, the sponsors are committing \u20ac80 million of subordinated financing to \nensure the project is completed. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n$ Million  Share  \nItem  \u20ac Million \nEquivalent  (%) \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Management \n34.  A steering committee consisting of Holcim, Garadagh Cement, and HGRS executives \nleads the project. The Garadagh Cement project manager, who has represented Holcim in the \nproject since 2003, reports directly to the steering committee and has overall responsibility for \nmanaging the EPC contract and local contracts, which cover the entire project scope. Reporting \nto  the  project  manager  are  a  construction  manager;  administrative  manager;  engineering \nmanager; environmental, safety, and health manager; and HGRS manager. The construction \nmanager leads the construction engineering team, trade supervisors, and quality assurance \nwhile  the  administrative  manager  leads  the  procurement,  contracts,  account,  and  human \nresources teams. The HGRS manager is accountable both to the project manager and to HGRS \nmanagement in Switzerland. \n                                                \n16 While repayment schedules will be the same, the ADB loan will have a slightly shorter availability period, reducing \nthe total tenor of the loan to 5.25\u20135.50 years. \n ", "10  \n \n \n2.  Construction Arrangements \n35.  The company will oversee construction of the project through a fixed-price, date-certain, \nEPC  contract  with  CBMI,  a  subsidiary  of  Sinoma  International  Engineering,  and  various \ncompetitively  bid  subcontracts  for  specialized  equipment  from  European  suppliers.  The \nanticipated commissioning of the project is 30 June 2011. Holcim's HGRS team is providing \noverall inspection and coordination services, including on-site inspection staff in the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) for equipment fabricated at Sinoma's facilities in the PRC. The total \nduration of construction is 33 months, which commenced in March 2009. Key equipment has \nbeen directly selected by Holcim with established European suppliers for better performance \nguarantees that can be serviced without intermediation by CBMI.  \n \n36.  Sinoma was founded in December 2001 out of the integration of four design institutes, \nfour engineering construction companies, and more than 10 cement equipment manufacturers. \nIt is a public company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is engaged in domestic and \noverseas  large-scale  cement  project  general  services  including  engineering  consultancy, \nengineering design, construction and erection, equipment manufacture, supply, commissioning, \noperation,  and  maintenance.  Sinoma  has  implemented  hundreds  of  large-scale  cement \nproduction lines in more than 30 countries in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. CBMI was the \nEPC contractor for Holcim's 4,000 TPD dry kiln project in Morocco, which was successfully \ncompleted on time and within budget. Other Sinoma experience includes (i) a 10,000 TPD \nproject for United Cement Company, United Arab Emirates in 2006; (ii) a 5,000 TPD project for \nFushon Xingfu, Viet Nam in 2005; (iii) a 5,000 TPD project for Cement Production Line General \nCompany, Saudi Arabia; (iv) a 3,300 TPD project in Albania; (v) a 3,300 TPD project for \nItalcement Financiera y Minera in Malaga, Spain in 2007; and (vi) a 6,000 TPD project for \nHeidelberg Cement Group, PRC in 2005. \n \n3.  Anticorruption Policy  \n37.  The borrower was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require the borrower to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the borrower \nwill further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n4.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n38.  The EPC contract with CBMI is Holcim's standard contract structure which allocates \nmost  project  implementation  risks  to  the  EPC  contractor,  covered  by  liquidated  damages \nclauses. Contract payments are not tied to completion milestones, but based on progress \n(percent complete), invoiced and paid monthly. At the end of each month, CBMI submits a \nprogress assessment to the Garadagh Cement team. Holcim's project control specialists survey \nthe progress of construction and, once CBMI and Holcim agree, CBMI submits an invoice to \nHolcim. The lenders' independent engineer conducts a quarterly review of the design and \nconstruction  work,  program  status,  subcontracting,  expenditures,  and  forecast  cost  to \ncompletion. \n \n ", "  11 \n39.  The EBRD requires Garadagh Cement to conduct an independent review of the ESMP, \noccupational health and safety plan, corporate social responsibility commitments, and human \nresources management. The audit is required every calendar year within 120 days after year \nend.  The  review  also  encompasses  compliance  with  corporate  social  responsibility \ncommitments in the two settlements, Sahil and Umid. The borrower has agreed to increase the \nfrequency  of  the  ESMP  review  to  every  6  months  during  construction,  pursuant  to  ADB \nrequirements under ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 15). \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n1.  Instrument and Amount \n40.   The assistance consists of a direct, unsecured term loan of up to \u20ac20 million ($27 \nmillion equivalent) to the company, denominated in euros with a fully amortizing 5.5-year door-\nto-door tenor, including a grace period of no more than 18 months and with an estimated 3.0 \nyear\u20133.5 year average loan life. In lieu of direct security, the sponsor is providing an additional \n\u20ac30 million in contingent financing to ensure completion of the project.  \n  \n2.  Terms and Conditions \n41.  The terms and conditions of the proposed ADB financing are relatively consistent with \ntranche 1 of EBRD's senior loan to the company, which was signed in November 2009, and \ndisbursements and repayments will be on a pari passu basis. \n  \n3.  Compliance with Investment Limitations \n42.  The  proposed  loan  will  be  within  the  country,  industry,  group,  and  single  project \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n43.  Once  approved,  this  will  be  ADB's  first  nonsovereign  infrastructure  financing  in \nAzerbaijan. The project merits ADB's support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The project promotes the adoption of modern, fuel-efficient, and environmentally \nsustainable technology by the company in implementing its expansion plans and \nensures compliance with international and European standards as nonnegotiable \nperformance indicators. The project will use less energy resources for expanded \nproduction, substantially improve air emissions (particulates, NO , and CO ), and \nx 2\nreduce water consumption and effluent discharge. \n \n(ii)  ADB's  participation  also  supports  and  endorses  Azerbaijan's  privatization \nobjectives by investing in a private sector company that entered the market \nthrough a transparent and competitive privatization tender. Garadagh Cement is \nthe country's largest privatized company outside the oil and gas sector and the \nADB  investment  further  strengthens  private  investor  sentiment  to  diversify \nbeyond the oil and gas sector. \n \n ", "12  \n \n(iii)  Partnering with the EBRD on nonsovereign and private sector transactions in \nCentral Asia and the Caucasus increases the effectiveness of development aid, \nand such successful partnerships will lead to other joint multilateral transactions \nin the region. \n \nC.  Assurances \n44.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),17 the government will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to Garadagh Cement. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form \nand substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by ADB \nBoard of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n45.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan  of up to \u20ac20,000,000 to Garadagh Cement Open Joint Stock Company for the \nGaradagh  Cement  Expansion  and  Energy  Efficiency  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 5.5 years, including a grace period of 1.5 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthis report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nC.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nThe project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Azerbaijan (last updated \nin 2006), which emphasizes promoting economic growth in industries and sectors outside of the oil and gas sector.a Cement \nis a critical product needed by large local contractors working on various transport and urban development infrastructure \nprojects being prioritized by the Government of Azerbaijan. These infrastructure projects are key to the diversification of \neconomic growth of the country; hence, by supporting a project in the building materials sector, the project can indirectly \ncontribute to poverty reduction. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \n1. Key issues. By locally producing cement which is cost-effective for local industries, the project is expected to sustain \ninfrastructure development for roads, urban transport, and tourism and help strengthen private sector activities in associated \nindustries in the country through employment generation and the promotion of related businesses. Garadagh Cement has \nmore than 580 employees, of whom around 470 are directly involved in cement production. A large percentage of Garadagh \nCement's employees are from two settlements within the vicinity of the cement plant and the quarries. Expansion of the \ncement plant will sustain jobs and opportunities for the local people in these two settlements. In addition to direct employment, \nthe construction phase of the project will contribute to poverty reduction by boosting the local economy and Azeri enterprises. \nDuring construction, the project will offer a wide range of opportunities with regard to the delivery of services, such as catering \nand accommodation for the construction workforce or the delivery of subcontractor services and goods for the construction \nworks. The potential for local procurement of works, goods, and services, either directly via Garadagh Cement or the \nengineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, is presently estimated to be in the range of \u20ac50 million to \u20ac80 \nmillion. Garadagh Cement plans to hold an information event for interested local companies about business opportunities in \nrelation to the project. This will be undertaken in coordination with the Ministry of Economic Development and the Baku \nChamber of Commerce and local entrepreneur organizations. \n \n2. Design features. The project will assist Garadagh Cement to modernize its Garadagh cement production plant which is \nlocated near Sahil Settlement about 34 kilometers (km) southwest of Baku and about 1 km inland from the Caspian Sea. \nWithin the frame of plant modernization, a state-of-the-art dry-process rotary kiln including raw material handling and raw \nmaterial preparation will be constructed at the Garadagh Cement plant site. This new dry kiln 6 will replace the present four \nwet-process kilns which will be decommissioned no later than 2 years after commercial operation of kiln 6. The project scope \nalso consists of a new five-stage precalcsiner preheater, a vertical roller mill, upgrades to three cement mills, the reopening of \na nearby limestone quarry, and new storage facilities and plant infrastructure.  \nC.

The environmental and social impact assessment undertaken for the project has identified the following social \nand socioeconomic impacts. \n \nLand acquisition and involuntary resettlement. All land necessary for the project is owned by Garadagh Cement. The new \nkiln and associated facilities will be built within the existing premises. The reopening of the Shakhgaya-West limestone quarry \n ", "16     Appendix 2 \nresults in no land use impacts. There is very little agricultural production in the region due to the arid climate and poor soils. \nThere is no notable agricultural use, except small-scale herding of predominantly goats and sheep. The project will not restrict \nthese activities as the area is vast and uninhabited. The rehabilitation work on the railway between the plant and the quarry \nwill take place along the same alignment and no additional land will be acquired. \n \nIndigenous people. There are two settlements in the vicinity of the cement plant and the quarries: Sahil and Umid. Sahil \nsettlement (population 22,700) was originally established as a workers\u2019 settlement for the cement plant during the Soviet \nperiod. It has grown into a highly industrial and commercial town. Umid settlement (population 2,000) comprises mainly \ninternally  displaced  persons  (75%)  from  the  Nagorno\u2013Karabagh  conflict.  There  are  no  indigenous  people  in  these \nsettlements. \n \nLabor. The construction period of the project will have a temporary (about 3 years) overall positive impact on the local labor \nmarket as a high proportion (more than 60%) of the estimated peak construction workforce will be locally employed. The great \nmajority of construction staff will be male. Information with regard to construction recruitment will be comprehensively and \npromptly communicated to the local population by Garadagh Cement and the EPC contractor. Employment opportunities will \nbe announced on notice boards in the communities. The appointment of a Garadagh Cement community liaison officer will \nfacilitate continuous contact with the local population and will at the same time allow Garadagh Cement and the EPC \ncontractor to explore local potential workforce options effectively.  \n \nAbout 60%\u201380% of the laborers for civil and structural works will be unskilled or semiskilled. It is estimated that during \nmechanical and electrical erection qualified third-country nationals will be employed on site.. The large total number of \nworkers and the presence of foreign workers could potentially lead to friction, related to misconduct or cultural differences, \namong the workforce or between workers and the local population. To minimize the potential for this to happen, a work site \nregulation and a workers\u2019 code of conduct will be set up and workers\u2019 compliance with rules will be supervised. If on-site \nissues arise, conflicts will be managed by the official representatives of the Garadagh Cement plant who will receive training \nin advance. Garadagh Cement will appoint a community liaison officer, and establish a complaints and grievance procedure in \norder to identify conflict issues early and to facilitate their resolution together with local residents. \n \nDuring operations, the Garadagh Cement workforce will be working with advanced production technology. Significant \ninvestment will be made to increase skills of the company personnel (technical staff in particular), to ensure that they have the \nrequired level of proficiency. Introduction of state-of-the art technology will lead to increased productivity and, as a result, will \nlead to obsolete staff positions and eventually to staff reduction. It is mainly workers with low skill levels who will become \nredundant. A comprehensive retrenchment plan will be developed by Garadagh Cement\u2019s human resources department to \nminimize potential negative impacts of loss of employment. Garadagh Cement will provide comprehensive assistance \nprograms guided by international best practice to the employees subject to redundancy on top of what is prescribed by Azeri \nlabor legislation. As the company intends to expand business further into other construction material sectors, internal transfer \noptions will be considered. Outside of Garadagh Cement\u2019s own staff, no significant employment effect will occur.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation.  \n \nAn extensive public consultation and disclosure process has been carried out under the European Bank for Construction and \nDevelopment (EBRD) as the lead lender. Public meetings were held in Sahil and Umid in June 2008 and the project was \ninitially  presented  to  stakeholders,  including  the  Ministry  of  Environment and  Natural  Resources  and  nongovernment \norganizations. A number of comments were received from these consultations. In general, the introduction of modern \nproduction technology with increases in efficiency and environmental performance was positively received. However, doubts \nwere expressed regarding future air pollution due to the increased production capacity and the fuel switch from natural gas to \ncoal. During community consultations in Sahil, opinions were voiced regarding the past and present influence of Garadagh \nCement plant on air quality (dust and smell nuisance was attributed to the plant) but overall improvements with plant \nmodernization were generally anticipated. In Umid, where jobs were lost with the completion of the Sangachal terminal \nconstruction works, the expectation of project-related employment opportunities, in particular during construction of kiln 6, was \nvoiced, and experience and qualifications gained from the terminal construction by local workforce was highlighted. General \ncommunity comments requested continuation of the Garadagh Cement social community investment programs.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing      Consultation     Collaborative decision making     Empowerment \n \n3.

Garadagh  Cement  will  nominate  a  community  liaison officer  responsible  for \ncontinuing communication with the public during construction and operation. Further, Garadagh Cement will implement a \ngrievance mechanism whereby the community liaison officer will be responsible for recording and responding to comments \nand grievances.  \n \nC.

Company Description \n \n1.  The sponsor, Holcim Limited, is one of the world's largest suppliers of cement and \naggregates.1 The group also supplies ready-mix concrete, concrete products, asphalt, and a \nrange  of  services.  Holcim  holds  majority  and  minority  stakes  in  operations  in  around  70 \ncountries  and  employs  around  80,000  people.  This  broad-based  presence  helps  stabilize \nearnings by evening out cyclical fluctuations in individual markets more effectively. Revenue \nstreams in 2009 from Asia and Latin America confirm that this compensatory effect operates \nwell even during recessionary phases. With the acquisition of Cemex operations in Australia, \nHolcim has further expanded its geographical presence. \n \n2.  The Holcim group of companies has the lowest carbon dioxide unit emissions worldwide \nof any cement manufacturer. Holcim is one of the leading companies in sustainability worldwide \nthrough its environmental stewardship, human capital development, and corporate citizenship \nprograms. The group has been confirmed as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in \n2009\u25002010 in the building materials industry and has been included in both the Dow Jones \nSustainability Index and the Dow Jones STOXX Sustainability Index for the past 7 years. \n \nB.  Operational and Financial Performance \n \n3.  Despite  the  sharp  decline  in  demand,  especially  in  mature markets, Holcim's  2009 \nfinancial performance remained relatively stable. The group had an operating profit of SwF2.8 \nbillion ($2.6 billion equivalent) on net sales of SwF21.1 billion ($19.9 billion equivalent), down \n16%  from  the  previous  year.  Operating  earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation,  and \namortization shrank by 13% to SwF4.6 billion. Financial performance was also affected by the \ncontinued appreciation of the Swiss franc relative to the currencies of major group companies in \nEurope, Mexico, and India. However, the group has an above-peer-average profitability and \ncash flow generation capability. In 2009, cement sales decreased by 8% to 131.9 million tons, \nand aggregate sales decreased by 14% to 143.4 million tons. Additionally, 3.5 million tons of \nother mineral components were sold in 2009. \n  \n4.  Holcim is a publicly traded company listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange with shares \ntraded on SWX Europe, and as of 31 December 2008 had a total market capitalization of \nSwF26.3 billion ($24.8 billion equivalent).2 The company is rated \u201cinvestment grade\u201d by the \ninternational rating agencies as follows: Standard & Poor\u2019s, BBB, outlook stable; Moody's, \nBaa2, outlook stable; and Fitch Ratings, BBB, outlook stable.3 These ratings compare favorably \nwith Holcim\u2019s principal global competition in cement and aggregates: LaFarge (BBB\u2013, negative), \nHeidelbergCement (BB\u2013, negative), and Cemex (B, stable).4  \n \n \n                                                \n1  Based on volumes shipped in 2008 of 143.4 million tons.

Company Ownership \n \n1.  Prior to 1999, Garadagh Cement was a state-owned company. It was established in \n1949 under the former Soviet Union to support government construction projects in the former \nSoviet Union. Two wet kiln lines were initially installed, and between 1957 and 1964 three more \nwet kilns were installed; four are in operation today (kilns 1\u20134).  \n \n2.  Holcim acquired 90% ownership of Garadagh Cement in the course of a competitive \ntender for privatization in 1999. Between that time and 2004, Holcim invested $23 million as per \nthe terms of the privatization tender, and received the final privatization certificate from the \nGovernment  of  Azerbaijan  in  February  2007.  Holcim  presently  holds  69.6%  of  Garadagh \nCement, having sold a 10% stake to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD)  in  2007,  and  10%  to  the  Azerbaijan  Investment  Company  (AIC),  a  government-\nsponsored equity investment fund, in 2008. The AIC is the private sector investment agency of \nthe Ministry of Economic Development tasked with the objective of investing and facilitating \ngrowth  outside  the  oil and gas  sector  while  still focusing  on  employment  and  value-chain \ncreation. The remaining 10.4% of shares are owned by the company's employees.  \n \nB.  Management \n \n3.  As required under the civil code in Azerbaijan, the company has a supervisory council \nwhich  directs  day-to-day  operations  through  the  general  director.  The  supervisory  council \ncomprises three representatives from Holcim, one from the EBRD, and one from the AIC. The \nchair of the supervisory council is nominated by Holcim. The general director of Garadagh \nCement attends all supervisory council meetings but is not a voting member. \n \n4.  While there is an on-site project manager for Garadagh Cement, Holcim Limited has \nestablished a steering committee which meets on a regular basis to review implementation \nprogress and provide guidance on technical issues.  \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 8.15", "CreationDate": "D:20100701095716", "ModDate": "D:20100701095716", "Title": "Microsoft Word - Garadagh Redacted V4 - for posting.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Author": "gtb"}, "author_page": " \n \nGLOSSARY \n \n  Clinker  \u2013  The base component of cement, consisting of a mixture of \nlimestone  and  clay  combined  by  chemical  reaction  in  the \ncement kiln stage.
