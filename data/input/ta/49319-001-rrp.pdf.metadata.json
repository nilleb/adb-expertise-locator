THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \nloans, (ii) proposed grants, and (iii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nGlobal Environment Facility (GEF), each to the Republic of Vanuatu for the Cyclone Pam Road \nReconstruction Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the efforts of the Government of Vanuatu to reconstruct, and \nclimate- and disaster-proof the transport sector infrastructure on Efate ring road, which suffered \nflood and storm damage as a result of Tropical Cyclone Pam (TCP) during 12\u201314 March 2015. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Climate and disaster risks. Vanuatu is one of the 20 most vulnerable countries in the \nworld to disasters caused by natural hazards, including cyclones, floods, landslides, storm \nsurges, earthquakes, tsunamis, and droughts.2 Climate change will affect disaster risk through \nchanges in the intensity and frequency of weather hazards. Projections for Vanuatu indicate the \nfrequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events are projected to increase, as is the intensity of \ncyclones. Transport infrastructure, in particular, is highly vulnerable to these hazards. \n \n4.  Description of the disaster. TCP struck Vanuatu as an extremely destructive category \n5 cyclone, with wind speed estimated at 250 kilometers (km)/hour and wind gusts peaking at \n320 km/hour. The center of the cyclone passed east of Efate Island (location of the capital, Port \nVila), and then continued southward, passing just west of Erromango and Tanna Islands. Heavy \nrainfall and destructive high storm surges caused severe flooding and widespread damage, \nparticularly in Tafea and Shefa provinces, where 11 fatalities were confirmed, and an estimated \n65,000  people  were  displaced  from  their  homes.3 Approximately  17,000  buildings  were \ndamaged or destroyed including houses, schools, clinics and other medical facilities (footnote \n3). TCP caused widespread crop destruction and compromised the livelihoods of at least 80% \nof Vanuatu\u2019s rural population (footnote 3). \n \n5.  The government and the international community (e.g., bilateral aid agencies, United \nNations  agencies,  and nongovernment  organizations)  provided  immediate  emergency  relief \nsupplies and transported these to the remote islands in Shefa and Tafea provinces. On 20 \nMarch 2015, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $1,000,000 grant from the Asia \nPacific Disaster Response Fund for humanitarian and relief efforts, and processed a grant of \n$5,000,000 financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, to support the rehabilitation of \njunior secondary schools in Tafea Province.45  \n \n6.  Damage and loss assessment. Immediately after TCP, the government led a rapid \njoint  post-disaster  needs  assessment  with  assistance  from,  and  in  partnership  with, \ndevelopment partners including ADB, the European Union, the United Nations, and the World \nBank. ADB provided technical expertise for the assessment of damaged transport infrastructure \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Grant to \nVanuatu for the Cyclone Pam School Reconstruction Project. Manila. ", "2 \nand public buildings. The rapid assessment estimated the total value of the losses caused by \nTCP to be approximately Vt48.5 billion (about $449.4 million equivalent).6 This is equivalent to \n64.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of Vanuatu. Out of the total damage costs, the \nhousing sector sustained the highest level of damage (32%), followed by the tourism sector \n(20%), the education sector (13%), and the transport sector (10%). In contrast, the largest \neconomic loss was sustained by agriculture (estimated at 33% of the total loss) and tourism \n(26%). The total medium- to long-term recovery needs equal about $316 million; the social \nsector (comprising housing, health, and education) has the highest needs, amounting to $205 \nmillion (65%), followed by the transport sector at $34 million (11%) (footnote 3). The needs in \nthe social sector is funded by other development partners including ADB (footnote 5). \n  \n7.  Economic impacts. Destruction caused by TCP, coupled with flooding, is expected to \nhave a substantial negative impact on growth, particularly in the tourism sector, which is the \nmain earner of foreign exchange. The closure of two major hotels and a number of motels until \nDecember 2015 imposes accommodation constraints on visitors, and the loss of a main source \nof revenue. Prior to TCP, the economy was projected to show strong growth over the medium \nterm\u20144.6% in 2015 and 4.7% in 2016, slowing slightly to 4.4% in 2017 (footnote 3). However, \npost-TCP recovery and reconstruction, some of which has commenced, will have a positive \neffect on GDP growth in 2015, offsetting some of the projected economic losses. When the \neffects of recovery and reconstruction are included, GDP growth in 2015 is estimated at 1.4%, \nrepresenting a decline of 3.2% percentage points from the pre-TCP baseline scenario (footnote \n3). \n \n8.  Damage to transport sector. The major impact on the transport sector was on the \nEfate ring road.7 Large water flows and the accumulation of upstream debris caused extensive \ndamage to bridges, approach roads, piers, abutments, river banks, and service connections. \nThe accumulation of debris at bridges, coupled with pressure from flood waters, burst through \nseveral riverbanks and approach roads, disconnecting the bridges and widening the rivers and \nstreams. Several major bridge components have been completely destroyed. Several culverts \nand headwalls collapsed completely or washed away as a result of flooding or storm surge. \nAbout 19 km of the sealed road\u2014which is located mostly on very flat, low-lying coastal terrain\u2014\nalso  suffered  extensive  pavement  damage,  with  roadside  drains  blocked  or  filled  with \naccumulated sediment and debris. Waves have scoured the sealed road in several locations, \nreducing traffic to a single lane. The damage assessment highlighted that the repairs to Efate \nring road should be addressed as soon as possible to minimize secondary economic impacts, \nand to restore connectivity to tourism centers and to essential services such as hospitals, \nschools, markets, and main commercial centers in Port Vila. \n \n9.  Government\u2019s recovery and reconstruction plan. On 22 June 2015, the government \napproved the Strengthening Ni-Vanuatu Resilience for the National Recovery and Economic \nStrengthening Program, administered by a program recovery committee (PRC) chaired by the \ndirector general of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.8 On 5 August 2015, the government organized a \ndevelopment partners\u2019 round table conference and announced that it successfully completed the \nhumanitarian action plan and has commenced program implementation, which is estimated to \n                                                \n6  Vanuatu: Post-Disaster Needs Assessment Executive Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n7  The 130-km major sealed highway provides transport services to the rural population (about 29,150 people) around \nthe Efate Island and connects to the capital (Port Vila, with an urban population of 55,525); it is the only road link \nservicing the rural population. \n8  Other members of the PRC are director generals of the ministries of finance and economic management, foreign \naffairs and trade, and infrastructure and public utilities. \n ", "3 \nbe completed by 2017. The government requested all development to actively contribute and \nsupport  its  program  emphasizing  capacity  development  for  stronger  Ni-Vanuatu  disaster \nresilience.  The  program  includes  post-cyclone  recovery  and  reconstruction  efforts  in  the \ntransport sector, specifically for road and bridge rehabilitation and restoration of areas damaged \nby landslides on Efate ring road.  \n \n10.  Request  for  emergency  assistance.  ADB  received  the  government\u2019s  request  for \nemergency assistance on 25 August 2015 to support its program in the transport sector.9 ADB\u2019s \nemergency response is guided by the Interim Pacific Approach, 2015, which extends the validity \nof the Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014.10 The processing of the emergency project was delayed by \n2 weeks due to political instability within the government, and the absence of key government \nofficials who were engaged on official duties overseas during the earlier stages of project \npreparation.  \n \n11.  Lessons  in  disaster  response.  The  project  incorporates  key  lessons  from  recent \ndisasters in Solomon Islands.11 It supports the government to \u201cbuild back better\u201d (BBB)\u2014i.e., \nupgrade infrastructure during reconstruction\u2014and strengthen resilience to future disasters and \nclimate  change,  particularly  through  more  resilient  roads  and  bridges.  The  government\u2019s \ncapacity  for  BBB  will  be  further  strengthened  by  integrating  the  design  and  supervision \nconsultants (DSCs) into the engineering unit of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities \n(MIPU).  Due  to  the  limited  number  of  technical  and  engineering  staff,  project  design  and \nconstruction supervision will be outsourced, and financed from the project. The DSCs will be \nrecruited under advance action to expedite project implementation. To ensure synergies and a \nlack of duplication of activities in the road sector, subproject selection will be closely coordinated \nwith development partners.12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be accelerated economic and social recovery in Vanuatu\u2019s TCP-affected \nprovinces. The outcome will be socioeconomic activities restored to at least pre-TCP levels. \n \nC.  Output \n13.  There will be only one output: transport infrastructure in damaged locations on Efate ring \nroad reconstructed, and climate- and disaster resilience improved. The tentative list of civil \nworks include (i) 10 km of road rehabilitated; (ii) 8 major stream crossings and their approach \nroads  rehabilitated  and  protected;13 (iii)  minor  damage  to  9  bridges  or  box  culverts  and \ncauseways  repaired,  and  debris  cleared;14 (iv)  200  meters  (m)  of  river  channel  realigned \n(upstream and downstream), and river training structures constructed; (v) 1,000 m of sealed \npavement protected against erosion from storm surge; (vi) 8 km of roadside and cross-road \ndrainage  improved;  (vii)  6  culvert  headwalls  reconstructed;  (viii)  250  m  of  guard  rail \nreconstructed; (ix) 180 m of riverbanks protected; (x) a 100 m by 50 m landslide at Klem\u2019s hill \n                                                \n9  The project meets the five eligibility criteria for, and satisfied the six characteristics of emergency assistance loans. \nADB. 2004.

Manila. \n12 The Japan International Cooperation Agency, which built the Teuoma Bridge after it was damaged in the 2001 \nearthquake, is considering its reconstruction. \n13 The bridges include Mele, Prima, Creek Ai, Marona, Lamin, Malatia, Pangpang, and Rentapau. \n14 The bridges include Eton Dry Creek, Eton Beach, La Cressonnaire, Havana, Tanoliu, Sara, Epule, Epau, and \nNeslep.  \n ", "4 \nrestored, and the road pavement protected; and (xi) a 600 m-long concrete longitudinal roadside \ndrain  at  Klem\u2019s  hill  improved.  All  the  measurements  are  estimates  and  are  subject  to \nconfirmation  during  topographic  and  bathymetric  (underwater  topographic)  surveys  during \nimplementation. All works will be designed and implemented using the BBB concept, and will \nstrengthen the climate and disaster resilience of roads and bridges. All works will incorporate \ngender conscious designs, including construction of walkways and provision of laundry facilities \nin streams alongside the road. The civil works will be considered as a single subproject over the \nroad length. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $18.50 million (Table1). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \nItem  Amount ($ million)a \nA.  Base Costb  16.03  \nB.  Contingenciesc  2.41 \nC.

The government has requested loans in various currencies equivalent to SDR708,000 \nand SDR1,986,000, and grants not exceeding $7,000,000 and $2,805,000, each from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The loans will have an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum; \na term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; repayment of principal at 2.0% per \nannum for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4.0% per annum thereafter, and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing  agreement.  The  interest  during \nconstruction  will  be  capitalized  under  the  loans.  The  GEF  will  provide  grant  cofinancing \nequivalent to $2,680,000, to be administered by ADB.15 The government will finance $1,910,000 \nin taxes and duties that it will exempt and $300,000 in-kind for audit fees and counterpart staff. \n \n16.

Cofinancing. Among the development partners, ADB was the first to prepare the project, \nand some development partners have expressed interest in participating, including through \ncofinancing. Under ADB\u2019s maximum fund allocation for Vanuatu, only 10 km of the 19 km of \ndamaged  road  would  be  rehabilitated,  and  additional  funds  from  cofinanciers  could  be \nleveraged to expand the project scope or the government may request other financiers to \nfinance directly.16 ADB typically seeks approval from its Board of Directors for administration of \nloan or grant funds from cofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place. Under \nthe proposed project, discussions are underway and no firm commitments are in place. In light \nof  the  need  for  expediency  and  efficiency  in  the  response  to  post-disaster  recovery  and \nrehabilitation, Management requests Board approval for the administration of any cofinanced \nfunds obtained from development partners subsequent to the date of Board approval, consistent \nwith the objective, purpose or scope of the project. The administration of such cofinanced funds \nwill be approved by  Management and reported to the Board in accordance with standard \nreporting procedures. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The  PRC  will  provide  overall  coordination  and  administrative  oversight  of  the \nStrengthening Ni-Vanuatu Resilience for the National Recovery and Economic Strengthening \nProgram. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) will be the executing \nagency and the MIPU will be the implementing agency. An infrastructure working group has \nbeen  established  in  the  MIPU  to  provide  oversight  for  project  implementation.17 A  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) comprising the DSCs will be established in the MIPU for project design \nand implementation. The DSCs will include international and national consultants, 30% of whom \nwill be women, and will be integrated within the MIPU\u2019s engineering unit. The DSC team leader \nwill manage project activities and coordinate with other development partners to ensure there is \nno duplication of activities. The DSCs will be responsible for the detailed assessment, feasibility \nstudies,  detailed  engineering  design,  cost  estimates,  tendering,  contract  management  and \nsupervision, and day-to-day implementation, including financial management, monitoring, and \nevaluation.  The  PMU  will  use  ADB  disbursement  procedures  and  financial  management \nguidelines, and will maintain separate accounts for the project, which will be audited by an \nindependent  auditor.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  and  administration  of \ncontracts on behalf of the MIPU. The project will be implemented within 2 years, which is the \nnorm for emergency assistance projects. \n \n19.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The  project  supports  activities  that  respond  to  critical  post-TCP  recovery  and \nreconstruction priorities in the transport sector, and tourism priorities of the government. The \nproject is coordinated with, and supported by, other development partners and will bolster \ncountry  ownership  and  further  improve  development  coordination.  The  civil  works  will  be \nselected from a long list of damaged sites,19 using criteria in the PAM, option analysis, cost \nestimates, and feasibility studies. The detailed engineering designs will include measures to \nsupport  the socially  vulnerable,  including  women,  children,  and the  disabled;  and  adopt  a \nsustainable  maintenance  strategy,  while  considering  future  traffic  growth  and  climate  and \ndisaster  risks.  A  climate  and  disaster  risk  vulnerability  assessment  will  be  prepared,  and \npotential adaptation and disaster risk management measures will be selected based on an \nanalysis of their effectiveness, cost, technical feasibility, and stakeholder acceptance, to ensure \nthat rehabilitation will follow the BBB concept and the standards for resilience to climate change \nand disaster, but appropriate to the local context. Lessons from the Solomon Islands, supported \nby geotechnical investigations, will be incorporated in the detailed engineering designs (footnote \n11). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Efate ring road serves a rural population of about 29,150 and an urban population of \n55,525. It increases access to and improves the quality of the road network, thereby reducing \nvehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  times,  and  improving  the  reliability  of  access  to  social \nservices. The improved road will further assist poverty reduction and increase incomes in rural \nareas  by  stimulating  economic  activity  (e.g.,  tourism,  local  business  development,  and \nagricultural activities). The project will be implemented as a sector project under emergency \nprocedures. ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004) provides the flexibility to \n                                                \n19 Government of Vanuatu. 2015. Impact Assessment Report on Efate and Epi Islands for Emergency and Recovery \nAssessment of Damaged Transport Infrastructure. Port Vila. \n ", "7 \nconduct the economic analysis after Board approval. The economic analysis of the subprojects \nwill be carried out during the feasibility studies and before detailed engineering designs and \nimplementation, in accordance with ADB guidelines.20 The damaged infrastructure will not be \nrelocated but instead reconstructed within the existing right-of-way but to a higher standard, \nusing BBB principles. The subprojects in the impact assessment report will be selected and \nprioritized  in  accordance  with  the  selection  criteria,  including  financial  and  economic \nconsiderations that specify a minimum economic internal rate of return of 12% (footnote 19). \nThe economic due diligence will include demand analysis, cost\u2013benefit analysis, alternatives \nand least-cost analysis, sensitivity analysis, sustainability analysis, distribution analysis, and risk \nanalysis.21 There will be significant unquantified benefits, including (i) improved reliability for \nshort-distance nonmotorized traffic; (ii) improved safety for both vehicles and pedestrians in \ndensely  populated  areas  through  footpaths  and  pedestrian  crossings;  and  bridges  with \nprovisions for footpaths, crash barriers, and hand rails; (iii) improved reliability of bridges on the \nentire  length  of  the  ring  road,  which  may  induce  increased  agricultural  production,  and \nstimulation and expansion of tourism; and (iv) reduced upstream damming effects through \nhigher-level structures with wider spans, thus reducing flood damage to structures, approach \nroads, crops, and buildings adjacent to riverbanks. \n  \n22.  The project outputs are public service goods with no cost recovery, and hence no \nfinancial viability assessment is required. Roads and bridges to be constructed using BBB will \nbe maintained from the MIPU\u2019s ongoing recurrent budget. The government\u2019s commitment to \nfinancing  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  costs  will  be  obtained  as  a  loan  and  grant \nassurance. The project output will have BBB features that enhance resilience, which will reduce \noperation and maintenance funding requirements for the first 2\u20133 years. Sufficient resources \nhave been allocated to the DSCs to undertake the economic and financial due diligence during \nimplementation. \n  \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial  management.  The  MIPU  has  implemented  a  number  of  ADB-financed \nprojects through various PMUs.22 The accounting and bookkeeping for these projects has been \nthrough  various  PMUs  and  was  centrally  monitored  and  kept  by  the  Vanuatu  Project \nManagement Unit and the MFEM Department of Finance and Treasury. Both the MIPU and the \nMFEM have been involved in financial management of projects, accounting, financial reporting, \nand audit, and have gradually built their capacity.23 A financial management assessment of the \nexecuting and implementing agencies was conducted for the projects (footnote 22) and will be \nupdated within 3 months of Board approval. The overall fiduciary risk was rated as moderate \nand remains manageable and will be further mitigated by the provision of a dedicated full-time \nqualified accountant to the PMU. The DSCs include a financial management specialist to carry \nout  financial  due  diligence\u2014including  conducting  financial  analyses  of  the  executing  and \n                                                \n20 ADB. 1997.

An asset management plan will be prepared by the DSCs projecting \nexpenditures over a 5-year period for the sustainability of Efate ring road. The procurement \ncapacity assessment of MIPU conducted for the prior projects (footnote 22) identified a lack of \nprocurement capacity within MIPU. A procurement specialist will be provided through the DSCs \nto undertake all project procurement and build capacity of MIPU staff. \n \n24.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the MFEM and the MIPU. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  The  destruction  of critical  infrastructure  has  impacted  many  people,  and  vulnerable \ngroups  in  particular.  Such  disaster  events  also  create  new  vulnerabilities  by  reducing \nemployment  and  livelihood-generating  ability,  personal  safety,  public  health  and  sanitation, \nhousehold efficiency, and food production. While the destruction of physical assets by the \ncyclone occurred in March 2015, production losses and associated increased production costs \nwill  linger  for  some  time.  The  negative  impact  of  the  disaster  on  overall  socioeconomic \nconditions in the country will be felt for many years. The project\u2019s expected poverty and social \nbenefits and impacts on local communities will be analyzed through a review of previous social \nand poverty analyses and consultations with stakeholders under ongoing ADB-financed projects. \nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy has been prepared.24 As highlighted in the \npost-disaster needs assessment, repairs to roads and bridges are being prioritized to minimize \nsecondary economic impacts, and to restore connectivity to essential services such as hospitals, \nschools, markets, and main commercial centers in Port Vila. The project will contribute to \nreconstruction  and  repair  of  critical  affected  transport  infrastructure  and  rebuild  transport \nnetworks to higher standards of climate and disaster resilience. \n  \n26.  Gender. The project is classified as having some gender elements, and details of the \ngender approach will be developed during implementation. Women will be encouraged to take \nup employment during project implementation (reconstruction). Men and women engaged in the \nproject will be paid equal wages for equal work. Various training and awareness activities will be \nundertaken, including training on traffic control at construction sites and safeguards; education \nawareness on HIV/AIDS and prevention, coordinated with an HIV coordinator from the Ministry \nof Health, to all construction workers and the majority of roadside inhabitants; and awareness \non gender-sensitive transport and road safety issues. A resettlement plan or report will be \nprepared  for  any  land  acquisition  or  other  nonland  impacts,  and  will  ensure  that  equal \ncompensation  and  assistance  will  be  provided  to  all  TCP-affected  people.  Gender-specific \noutputs,  targets,  and  indicators  are  integrated  into  the  project\u2019s  design  and  monitoring \nframework.  \n \nE.   Safeguards \n \n27.  Environment. The project is classified as category B for environment. It is expected to \nhave limited, site-specific, and, in most cases, temporary adverse impacts on the environment, \nwhich can be readily mitigated and managed under the environmental management plans \nincluded in the environmental assessment of civil works. An environmental assessment and \n                                                \n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nreview  framework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website.25 The  EARF  requires \nscreening and assessment, including preparation of an environmental management plan (EMP) \nfor  each  of  the  civil  works  or  project  segments  following  the  Environment  Protection  and \nConservation Act (as amended) 2010, with any additional elements as required to also comply \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  During  the  road  reconstruction,  environmental \nsafeguards will follow the system currently being implemented by the government for other ADB \nor  externally  funded  projects,  whereby  minor  repair  works  are  implemented  following \nenvironmental  management  and  safety  guidelines  or  a  simple  EMP,  and  major  works \nassociated  with  rehabilitation  or  reconstruction  of  roads  and  bridges  will  be  subject  to \nenvironmental  assessment (and  an  EMP)  that  will  be  updated  during  detailed  engineering \ndesign, and incorporated in bidding and contract documents to be implemented by contractors \nand monitored by the implementing agency. Monitoring will be undertaken in line with the \nmonitoring plan included in the EARF. In line with ADB's Public Communications Policy 2011, all \nrelevant safeguards information will be made available in a timely manner and in a form and \nlanguage understandable to affected people and other stakeholders. ADB and the government \nwill post the monitoring reports on their websites. \n \n28.  Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. The project is classified as category B \nfor land acquisition and involuntary settlement. A resettlement framework has been prepared for \nthe project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project is within the \nexisting ring road corridor; temporary access to land outside the corridor will be required during \nconstruction. Some small areas of additional land (for coastal protection works) may be required \nat three or four locations; this will be through negotiated settlement and/or voluntary donation in \naccordance with the project\u2019s resettlement framework. Civil works will require temporary land \nuse or access during reconstruction, and this will be obtained through voluntary donation or land \nuse  agreements  with  landowners  or  affected  people.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been \nprepared  describing  the  procedures  for  (i)  screening  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts; (ii) social impact assessment and preparation of a resettlement plan, if needed; and (iii) \nnegotiation  and  agreements  (such  as  memorandums  of  agreement)  for  land  access  with \ndocumentation of agreements and verification by a third party confirming that agreements were \ntruly voluntary.26 The resettlement framework has been discussed with the MIPU and it has \nendorsed the resettlement framework, which has been posted on ADB\u2019s website. A resettlement \nspecialist has been included in the DSC to prepare the resettlement plan, if required, including \nthe due diligence reports and the completion of third party validation. \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. \nMelanesians are the native people of Vanuatu and comprise the vast majority of the population \nas well as the project beneficiaries. The project is not expected to impact any distinct and \nvulnerable groups of indigenous peoples. All project components will be implemented in a \nculturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  The overall risk is medium, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. The main risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n                                                \n25 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of procurement  A procurement specialist in the PMU will carry out all the project procurement activities and \ncapacity in the MIPU  will build capacity in MIPU\u2019s engineering staff \nWeak financial  The financial management assessment will be conducted and updated within 3 months \nmanagement  after Board approval.
