INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to strengthen its public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) legal framework through a review of international PPP legislation experience,1 \nan assessment of the PRC\u2019s own experience, further study of key legal issues identified during \nthe national PPP law preparation, and a review of PPP-related fiscal risk management issues.2 \nThe TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u201320203 and is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for the PRC.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC faces a myriad of challenges in ensuring equitable growth and social services \namong different areas. In response, the government has undertaken several reforms to rebalance \ngrowth between regions and increase the availability of basic services. The needs are vast and \ninvolve not only capital investment for infrastructure but also skilled workers to manage and \noperate existing systems. Since the early 1990s, PPP has been widely used by the government \nto deliver public services\u2014transport and communication, energy, water, wastewater treatment, \nand other social services\u2014in a more efficient way.5 \n \n3.  However, PPP activities in the PRC have decreased since the mid-1990s. Estimates show \nthat the value of investment commitments under PPPs fell to a low of $1.1 billion in 2010, which \nwas less than 10% of its peak in 1997.6  While the downward trend in PPP activities is largely \nattributable to the emergence of alternative ways of financing public infrastructure and services, \nnotably local government investment vehicles, it is also due in part to gaps in the enabling \nenvironment and associated tools, i.e., the absence of a national PPP law, dedicated government \nPPP units, and manuals and procedures for preparing and implementing PPP projects. \n \n4.  In September 2014, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) released a notice on refining the \napproach to PPP operations,7 followed by a series of regulations and guidelines, with the intent \nto strengthen the PRC\u2019s operational framework for PPPs. The policies covered topics including \nproject screening, value-for-money analysis, fiscal affordability test, standard PPP contract format, \nPPP-related government procurement procedures, incentive policies, and the development of a \ncomprehensive PPP information database. Most of the regulatory instruments were developed \nbased  on  international practices  and  lessons derived  from  years  of  local  PPP  operational \nexperience. The PPP pipeline quickly expanded with the revised PPP operational framework. \nThrough the comprehensive PPP information database developed and operated by MOF, all \ngovernment-approved PPP pipeline information and specific PPP project information are now \n                                                \n1  A PPP legal framework is typically identified not only in laws and regulations but also in policy documents, guidance \nnotes, and in the design of standard PPP contracts. It is the combination of policy, law and other legal instruments, \nprocedures,  implementation  manuals,  relationships  with  other  laws  and  regulations,  and  the  expertise  and \nexperience of public administration and private sector participants that determines whether one country has a \nworkable legal and regulatory framework for PPP. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 September 2018. \n3  ADB. 2016.

Beijing (September). \n ", "2 \naccessible to policy makers, potential investors, and the public. As of end September 2017, there \nwere 14,220 projects in the PPP pipeline with a total investment of $2.69 trillion.8 \n \n5.  On PPP legislation, in 2013, the State Council approved the preparation of the Concession \nLaw for Infrastructure and Other Public Services, which ADB provided TA support for and which \nbegan the groundwork for a national PPP law in 2016. 9 The national PPP law was intended to \nstrengthen the enabling legal and regulatory environment for PPPs, which would help standardize \nthe approaches in preparing and implementing PPP projects across all sectors. The Provisional \nRegulations on Public\u2013Private Partnership in Infrastructure and Public Service (consultation \nversion) were completed in 2017 and presented to the public for comments. This marked a \nmilestone  in  the  PRC  national  legislation  process.  However,  differing  opinions  concerning \nfundamental legal and regulatory issues could not be reconciled among PPP legislators and \npractitioners. These issues included, among others, the definition and practice areas of PPP and \nconcessions, applicable procurement procedures, responsible regulatory agencies, risk-sharing \nand mitigation measures among parties involved, fiscal risk management, and PPP dispute \nsettlement mechanisms. These unresolved issues are delaying the government\u2019s plan to develop \nthe PPP legal and regulatory framework. \n \n6.  Further, the value-for-money analysis and the fiscal affordability test requested by MOF \nhave not been fully carried out because of capacity constraints of local officials, unrealistic cost \nprojections, and the absence of public sector comparator projects.10 The quality of PPP project \npreparation has been poor because of these weaknesses, adding pressure to government fiscal \nrisk control and debt exposure. Consequently, it is difficult for MOF to achieve its original target \nof promoting PPPs for sustaining infrastructure investment operations, while easing the fiscal \nburden on heavily indebted local governments. Concern over the rising local government debt \nburden, and the central government\u2019s efforts to curb indirect financing mechanisms used by the \nlocal governments, has propelled the government to tighten fiscal controls and reexamine its PPP \npipeline of projects. \n \n7.  In late 2017, the MOF further tightened approval rules for new initiatives and requested \nprovincial finance bureaus to weed out \u201cunqualified\u201d PPP projects.11 The criteria for identifying \nsuch projects includes the conduct of return-on-investment evaluation and fiscal affordability test, \nexamining PPP fiscal commitments versus local governments\u2019 fiscal spending ceiling, issuance \nof official local government guarantee, meeting information transparency requirements, and on-\nschedule implementation. Based on the MOF database, 1,695 projects amounting to over $0.27 \ntrillion were removed from the government\u2019s PPP pipeline by 23 April 2018.12 The State-Owned \nAsset Supervision and Administration Commission also issued policies to control state-owned \nenterprise participation in PPPs, and the National Development and Reform Commission issued \npolicies to provide incentive for the private sector investment in PPPs. \n \n8.  Further improvements in the PPP legal structure and operational framework, particularly \nthe fiscal risk management framework, will be needed to secure a stable enabling environment \n                                                \n8  MOF, Government of the PRC. 2018.

Research and analysis on these fundamental legal \nissues are needed to help legislators and practitioners quickly arrive at a consensus and move \ntoward developing a workable PPP legal and regulatory framework governed by the national PPP \nlaw. After the issuance of a national PPP law, the MOF and other government agencies will need \nto prepare new implementation regulations and guidance notes based on the principles of the \nnational PPP law. \n \n9.  The current PPP legal structure and regulatory framework needs further improvement. \nThe remaining legal and regulatory issues need to be carefully examined and the PPP-related \npublic financial management system should be improved to better control fiscal risks. Further \nresearch on international PPP legislation and implementation experience of the PRC will be \nhelpful in improving the PPP legal environment. More importantly, from MOF\u2019s perspective, the \ndevelopment of an effective PPP-related public financial management system is the key to \nmonitoring and controlling fiscal risks. Research studies will be conducted from a legal and \nregulatory point of view: (i) improvement of value-for-money analysis and fiscal affordability test \nto secure PPP projects\u2019 value for money assessed at appraisal and approval stage, and that \naggregate fiscal commitment is affordable to the government; and (ii) enhancement of present \nPPP-related budgeting, government accounting, reporting, and PPP-related asset management \narrangement to make sure PPP fiscal commitments are properly monitored and controlled. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved public service quality in the PRC. \nThe TA is also aligned with the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 to further strengthen the \nPPP  enabling  environment,  providing  incentive  for  private  sector  investment  in  urban \ninfrastructure and the public service sector.13 The outcome will be enhanced PPP legal and \noperational framework.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  The TA will facilitate improvements in the PPP legal and regulatory environment and \nstrengthen the PPP-related fiscal risk management framework, which are important components \nof the PPP enabling environment. The TA activities will be implemented through legal and \nregulatory, institutional, and policy advice. \n \n12.  Output 1: Research on public\u2013private partnership legal and regulatory framework \nconducted. A review of PPP legislation experience from countries with active PPP programs, \nreview of PRC\u2019s own experience, organization of policy dialogue and consultation, and conduct \nof further study on key legal and regulatory issues identified during the national PPP law \npreparation. Based on the research, suggestions on how to further enhance the legal and \nregulatory framework to secure stable development of the PRC\u2019s PPP program will be proposed. \nPolicy notes will be prepared based on the research findings. \n \n13.

Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).15 \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of meeting space, counterpart \nstaff, other services to consultants, assistance in arranging meetings with counterpart agencies, \noffice accommodation, office supplies, other information and support needed for the TA, and other \nin-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will commence on 1 November 2018 and will be completed on 30 September 2020. \nThe executing agency will be the MOF, and the implementing agency will be the Legal Department \nof the MOF. Considering the wide range of TA research coverage, the implementing agency will \ncoordinate the participation of other MOF PPP Promotion Leading Group member departments.16 \nOutside of the MOF, the National Development Reform Commission and other relevant ministries \nwill be invited to participate in workshops, policy dialogues, and consultations. ADB will administer \nthe TA; select, supervise, and evaluate consultants and recruit resource persons; and organize \nworkshops with the implementing agency. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs, following the agreed timeline and budget. Consultants will submit \nan inception report, a midterm report, a draft final report, and a final report to the government and \nADB. TA review missions will be used to aid in monitoring progress. The knowledge products \ncreated by the TA will be submitted to the MOF and ADB. \n  \n18.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n   \n                                                \n15 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n16 In May 2014, the MOF designated the PPP Promotion Leading Group headed by one deputy minister and composed \nof departments relevant to PPP promotion: Finance Department, Economic Construction Department, Legal \nDepartment, Budget Department, International Economic and Finance Cooperation Department, and PPP Center. \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  November 2018\u2013September 2020  \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Finance  \nImplementing agency  Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance \nConsultants  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by \n  Legal specialist (IC)  Individual selection  ADB \n  PPP specialist (IC)   Individual selection  ADB \n  Legal specialist (NC)  Individual selection  ADB \n  Fiscal risk  Individual selection  ADB \nmanagement \nspecialist (NC) \n  Coordinator (NC)  Individual selection  ADB \n  Resource persons   Individual selection  ADB \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following the Asian Development \nBank's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IC = international consultant, NC = national consultant, PPP = public\u2013private \npartnership, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n19.
