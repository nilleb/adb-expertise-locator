INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  included  a  capacity  development  technical \nassistance (TA)1 in its Sri Lanka Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2009\u20132011,2 with the key \nobjective of supporting the implementation of the proposed ADB loan for the Greater Colombo \nWastewater Management Project. A fact-finding mission was undertaken in Colombo for this TA in \nMay 2009 concurrently with the fact-finding mission for the proposed loan, where key aspects of \nthe proposed TA and the project were discussed with the officials of the Government of Sri Lanka \nand  other  stakeholders.  A  consensus  was  reached,  in  principle,  on  the  purpose,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. The concept for this TA was \napproved by ADB Management on 17 April 2009.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Colombo is Sri Lanka\u2019s economic and administrative center. The Government, in its 10-year \ndevelopment framework for 2006\u20132016, aims to achieve high and steady economic growth in the \ncountry and wishes to modernize Colombo as its renewed growth engine. Adequate provision of \nurban  services  is  critical  to  Colombo\u2019s  ability  to  attract  investment  and  increase  productivity. \nColombo is rapidly developing its urbanized area, expanding to the south (along the coast) and \neast (inland). Despite rapid urbanization, urban infrastructure and services remain limited, and fail \nto meet demand and support increasing economic development and the potential for growth.   \n \n3.  In its commitment to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, the Government \nidentified access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation as priority objectives. These \npriority  objectives  are  also  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  10-year  development  framework. \nConsiderable attention is now being given by the Government to the achievement of water supply \nand sanitation objectives. However, many past discussions have focused on water supply, and the \nreal objectives and philosophy behind urban wastewater management now need to be brought into \nthe forefront. \n \n4.  The specific goals of the Government in the sector include, among others, provision of (i) \naccess to adequate sanitation to 100% of the population by 2025, (ii) piped sewerage systems in \nmajor urban areas and selected growth centers, and (iii) standard on-site sanitation to all those \nwho are not connected to a sewerage system or sanitation scheme. In addition, the Government\u2019s \nstrategy  highlights  the  importance  of  the  sector\u2019s  financial  sustainability\u2014and  the  institutional \ncapacity  of  key  sector  agencies,  including  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board \n(NWSDB) and local authorities\u2014in order to achieve the sector goals.  \n \n5.  The existing public sewerage system in Greater Colombo is old and limited in coverage. \nThe wastewater master plan4 estimated that 66% of the population of the Colombo capital region \nwas served by on-site facilities, 19% was served by the public sewerage system,5 and 15% had no \nfacilities. Its sewerage system has also suffered from various technical, institutional, managerial \nand operational problems. Colombo\u2019s sewerage operation has long been neglected under an \nadverse institutional environment, in which ownership of sewerage assets remained uncertain for \n                                                 \n1  The title of the TA has been changed from Supporting Capacity Development for Local Authorities. \n2   ADB. 2008. Sri Lanka: Country Partnership Strategy 2009-2011. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the ADB business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 April 2009. \n4  Engineering Science. 1993. Wastewater Master Plan for Greater Colombo. Colombo. \n5  It is estimated that the coverage of public sewerage system expanded to around 25% in Greater Colombo by 2007. \n ", "2   \nover a decade.6 There has been lack of clarity in the roles and ambiguity about ownership of \nassets  between  the  two  key  institutions  involved  in  the  wastewater  management  services\u2014\nNWSDB and the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC).7 This has led to ineffective management of \nsewerage sector operations, with poor accountability. Further, financial resources obtained through \nlocal taxes and Government subsidies are insufficient to fund sustainable delivery of wastewater \nservices.  The  sustainability  of  wastewater  services  is  further  compromised  by  operational \ninefficiencies. In the absence of preventive maintenance or planned replacement, the system has \nbeen  run  by  addressing  emergencies  as  they  arise.  Assets  are  not  usually  inventoried,  and \naccurate databases are lacking, including both spatial databases (e.g., digital maps of sewers, \npumping stations, and outfalls) and attribute databases (e.g., characteristics of sewers). \n \n6.  Massive  capital  investments  are  required  in  the  wastewater  sector  to  upgrade  the \nmalfunctioning infrastructure and, in the long term, to add new assets to cover the underserved. At \npresent, the sector does not generate enough revenue to invest in new infrastructure, or even to \nmeet operation and maintenance costs. Both CMC and NWSDB have incurred deficits in sewerage \noperations in recent years, which have prevented them from sustaining regular asset replacements, \nleading to poor service delivery. Furthermore, while NWSDB recently introduced sewerage tariff \nwithin its operational jurisdiction,8 and has thereby secured a dedicated account for wastewater \nservices,  in  CMC  the  sewerage  and  drainage  operations  are  not  separately  delineated. \nExpenditures  are  met  using  allocations  from  the  organization\u2019s  general  budget,  with  no \nindependent accounting of revenue and expenditure for sewerage operations.  \n \n7.  Wastewater  management  and  services  have  not  been  adequately  benchmarked  or \nmonitored. While current sewerage operational practices9 and uncontrolled discharge of industrial \neffluent into public sewers raise serious environmental concerns, there is no mechanism in place to \nmonitor water quality and comply with regulatory standards. Environmental regulations prescribed \nby the Central Environmental Authority are not properly monitored or complied with. There is also \nlack of accountability on the part of service providers for their service delivery, in terms of quality, \nquantity, timeliness and reliability of the services provided. There is no institutionalized system to \nregularly  check  and  benchmark  the  performance  of  wastewater  service  providers  against \npredetermined standards.  \n \n8.  In  this  context,  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  studies10 have \nestablished the need for investment in sewerage infrastructure in Greater Colombo and have \ncarried out the necessary analyses for the proposed project in terms of current status of sewerage \ninfrastructure and the institutional capacity of the service providers, and have identified the priority \n                                                 \n6  The asset owner of the sewerage system had long been believed to be the National Water Supply and Drainage Board \n(NWSDB), in accordance with the voluntary transfer order in 1996 under Section 64(1) of the NWSDB Law. However, \nin a legal opinion in September 2007 the Attorney General\u2019s Department determined that CMC is the legal owner of all \nsewerage assets within its jurisdiction. \n7  Following the 2007 opinion on asset ownership (footnote 5), CMC has been determined to be the owner and operator \nof the Colombo municipality sewerage system, with NWSDB remaining as asset owner and service provider of the \nsewerage system outside the Colombo municipality. \n8  The introduction of a sewerage charge was approved by the cabinet in September 2002. Subsequently the NWSDB \nBoard approved a sewerage tariff policy and a specific tariff structure, which the minister of water supply and drainage \nalso approved. The notification of the new sewerage tariff was gazetted in October 2007, with the sewerage tariff \napplied as of March 2008. As part of the system computerization at NWSDB, the form of the water bill was modified, \nand the sewerage charge incorporated within it.  \n9 Due to the malfunctioning of sewerage pumping stations and frequent sewer pipe collapses, the system operator often \nresorts to emergency bypass arrangements for discharge to surface waters.  \n10  ADB. 2004.

The studies have highlighted the \nneed to develop CMC\u2019s capacity to plan, implement, and monitor the proposed project. Further, as \nthe newly-determined asset owner of the sewerage system, and a first-time implementing agency \nunder the prospective ADB loan project, CMC needs intensive and extensive institutional capacity \ndevelopment support in order to fulfill its mandate of asset management, delivery of efficient and \neffective services to citizens, and management and implementation of the ADB loan project. In this \nregard, the TA will provide startup support to CMC in setting up a project management structure. \nThe TA and the ensuing project will also help CMC in terms of building its project management \nskills, institutional strengthening, financial reforms, and developing suitable operational systems \nand processes so that CMC becomes an efficient and effective wastewater service provider.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved operating efficiency and management performance \nin the wastewater services of CMC. The desired outcome is that CMC is ready to implement the \nprospective ADB loan project. The proposed TA will contribute to successful accomplishment of the \nintended outcomes by undertaking project preparatory activities and initial training and capacity \nbuilding of CMC to improve project readiness and ensure that implementation begins immediately \nonce the ensuing project becomes effective.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA consultants will primarily work with the project management unit in carrying out the \nidentified  tasks  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  TA  and  the  ensuing  loan  project.  The  TA \nconsultants will also conduct advance or preparatory activities for the ensuing loan project by \nrecruiting loan consultants (specifically, the institutional development consultant (IDC) and the \ndesign, supervision, and management consultant (DSC)). The key activities in achieving the TA \noutputs are as follows: \n \n1.  Establish Project Implementation Systems and Execute Startup Activities \n(i)  Establish a managerial and personnel structure for project governance, including \nproject management unit staffing and functionality;  \n(ii)  execute advance actions for (a) selection and mobilization of loan consultants, (i.e., \nIDC and DSC); (b) social and environmental safeguards compliance; (c) application \nof permits, sanctions, approvals and clearances from relevant authorities; and (d) \nsurvey,  investigations  and  studies  for  the  project,  including  technical  and \nsocioeconomic baseline survey; \n(iii)  undertake a procurement capacity assessment of the executing and implementing \nagencies, and update the procurement plan for the loan project and draft bidding \ndocuments and request for proposals for various contract packages identified in the \nprocurement plan; \n(iv)  survey  the  location,  quantity,  and  quality  of  industrial  effluent  and  interagency \ndischarges; \n(v)  establish a project performance management system; and \nThe view(vsi )e xpreesssteadb hlisehre ian  amreo nthitoosrein ogf  athned c oenvsaulultaantito ann sdy dsote nmot  fnoerc eesffseacrtiliyv ere mpreosneitnotr tinhogs eo fo sf uAbDpBr\u2019osj ect \nmembers, Boarda onfd D ciroencttroarcs,t  Mpraongargeesms.e nt, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n \n ", "4   \n2.  Establish an Operational Performance Management System for CMC \n(i)  Establish a framework for benchmarking and performance assessment of service \nprovision, and collection of baseline data;  \n(ii)  analyze all current processes and systems for information flows, decision-making \nlevels, and funds flows in relation to wastewater operations; \n(iii)  design a suitable framework for a performance budgeting system for sewerage \noperations, including hardware and software, processes, manuals, and monitoring \nmethods; \n(iv)  analyze  cost-recovery  mechanisms,  including  various  tariff  structures  and  their \nimplementation mechanisms;  \n(v)  update the sewerage customers database; \n(vi)  prepare an asset management system database for the creation, maintenance, \nrehabilitation and timely replacement of wastewater assets; and \n(vii)  prepare a spatial and attribute database framework that can be used in producing a \ngeographic information system of all sewerage assets. \n \n3.  Develop and Implement Capacity Development Plan \n(i)  Support CMC in implementing the institutional, financial, and management changes \nrecommended under the project; \n(ii)  undertake a capacity needs assessment for CMC, prepare a human resource plan \nand capacity development program, and undertake staff training; and \n(iii)  review and verify the institutional strengthening recommendations given in the PPTA \nstudies  (footnote  10),  and  prepare  an  action  plan  to  implement  the  verified \nrecommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $775,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB finance of $650,000; $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program (Technical Assistance Special Fund-IV) with the balance of $150,000 financed on \na grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, to be \nadministered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining cost ($125,000 equivalent) \nthrough  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  transport,  and  other \nmiscellaneous expenditures. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to approve any ensuing loan project. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government will be the Executing Agency \nand CMC will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for the TA. The executing agency will provide policy \nguidance and national-level coordination in relation to the TA and ensuing project. The IA will be \nresponsible for managing daily implementation activities. A TA advisory committee headed by the \nCMC municipal commissioner will be established to guide and provide support to the TA team for \nsmooth  activity  implementation.  CMC  will  provide  adequate  office  space  and  sufficient \ncommunication means to the TA team, and provide sufficient counterpart staff so that capacity \nbuilding of staff can take place through on-the-job involvement in the day-to-day activities of the TA \nteam.  \n \n ", "  5\n13.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 20 months, from September 2009 to April \n2011. In conducting the TA activities, international (total of 16 person-months) and national (total of \n26 person-months) consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). For continuity of the \nwork that has been performed well under the TA for Assessing Colombo Municipality Wastewater \nSystems (footnote 10), some of the individual consultants under that TA will continue to work under \nthe current TA. The international consultants will include experts in project management and \nwastewater  management  that  have  special  knowledge  regarding  procurement.  The  national \nconsultants will include experts in wastewater management, financial management, environment \nand social and community development. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Technical support (e.g., for surveys, data collection, and information technology) will \nbe provided to the consultants as required. The team leader will be responsible for coordinating \noverall activities and TA inputs in order to provide required reports and deliverables, and conduct \nsurveys and data collection. The TA will provide training to (i) PMU staff to familiarize them with \nADB\u2019s procurement procedures and national procurement system, and (ii) CMC and PMU staff on \nfinancial and accounting reform measures and ADB procures for disbursement and maintenance of \nproject accounts. \n \n14.  To facilitate TA implementation, an advance payment facility will be used for trainings, \nseminars, workshops and other capacity-development programs, surveys, equipment, and other \nmiscellaneous  administration  and  support  costs.  The  advance  payment  facility,  to  be  agreed \nbetween ADB and the IA, shall detail the procedures and implementation arrangements for use of \nthe advance, its liquidation and replenishment requirements, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.11 \n \n15.  The following reports will be submitted by the TA consultants: (i) an inception report, \nincluding  a  detailed  work  plan  (due  within  1  month  of  commencement);  (ii)  a  monthly \nimplementation report (due at the end of each month during the TA implementation period); (iii) an \ninterim  report  containing  details  of  work  done  as  per  expected  outputs  (due  9  months  after \ncommencement); (iv) a draft final report (due 15 months after commencement); and (v) final report \n(due 18 months after commencement). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $150,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant \nbasis, to the Government of Sri Lanka for Supporting Capacity Development for Wastewater \nManagement Services in Colombo, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2008.
