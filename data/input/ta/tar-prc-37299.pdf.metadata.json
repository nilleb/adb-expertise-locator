The  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) during the 2003 country programming mission to provide technical \nassistance (TA) for Strengthening the Statistical System of the China Banking Regulatory \nCommission (CBRC). In response to the request, a fact-finding mission1 visited Beijing on \n15- 20  April  2004.  The  mission  met  with  officials  from  CBRC  and  relevant  government \nagencies, and agreed on the TA objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements. The \nTA logical framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  CBRC was established in April 2003  as part of the restructuring of the financial \nsupervisory  framework  to  strengthen  banking  supervision  and  reorient  the  focus  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) as the  central bank.2 This step was taken to draw a line \nbetween banking supervision and monetary policy, and to strengthen banking supervision \ncapacities. CBRC\u2019s creation also finalizes the transfer of PBC\u2019s formerly all-encompassing \nregulatory powers over the financial service industry.3 CBRC\u2019s main responsibilities are to (i) \nissue regulations and  guidelines related to banking organizations and nonbank financial \ninstitutions  (NBFIs)  subject  to  CBRC\u2019s  supervision;  (ii)  examine  and  approve  the \nestablishment, closure, and modification of banking organizations and NBFIs, their branches, \nand their scope of business;  and (iii) conduct on-site and off-site supervision of banking \norganizations and NBFIs. \n \n3.  The legal basis for the separation of CBRC from PBC, and for CBRC\u2019s function \nderives from the three banking laws that took effect in February 2004.4 The Central Bank Law \nsolidifies the position of PBC as legally responsible for determining and executing monetary \npolicy, managing the foreign exchange market, guarding against financial risk, ensuring \nfinancial stability, and combating money laundering. The Banking Supervision Law mandates \nCBRC to regulate and supervise all banks, other depository institutions, and NBFIs. This law \nintroduced  some  of  the  Basel  Core  Principles  for  Effective  Banking  Supervision  and \ninternational norms or standards for banking supervision.  Adoption of these principles is \ndesigned to steer commercial banks toward better risk control. The Commercial Banking Law \nremoves from the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) the obligation to grant loans to \nprojects approved by the State Council. The law  also allows banks to  participate in many \nactivities taken for granted in advanced economies: purchasing and selling government and \nfinancial bonds, engaging in foreign exchange, and offering bank card services.5 \n \n4.  Four  SOCBs\u2014Industrial  and  Commercial  Bank  of  China,  Bank  of  China,  China \nConstruction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China\u2014account for about two thirds of market \n                                                 \n1  The mission comprised Y. Qian, principal financial economist of the Governance, Finance and Trade Division of \nthe East and Central Asia Department. \n2  PBC is focused on monetary policy, currency stability, and similar central-bank responsibilities. \n3  Like many countries, the PRC has a segregated financial supervisory structure. CBRC is responsible for \nbanking,  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission  for  capital  markets,  and  China  Insurance  Regulatory \nCommission for insurance markets. A joint regulatory committee comprising heads of the three regulatory \nbodies coordinates these agencies\u2019 activities. \n4  A TA helped draft these laws. ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Banking \nLaws and Regulations. Manila. \n5  Although banks are  prohibited from  investing in NBFIs, the laws leave room for  expanding into nonbank \nbusinesses such as securities and insurance, promising increased profitability and greater risk diversification for \nbanks. \n ", "2    \nshare in terms of total assets. The country has 11 joint-stock commercial banks (JSCBs) with \na little more than 10% market share, over 3,000 rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) with 10% \nmarket share, and more than 100 city commercial banks with about 5% market share. The \nmarket share of foreign banking organizations is still small, at only 1.4%. \n \n5.  An  effective  financial  statistical  system  is  indispensable  for  macroeconomic \nmanagement and financial sector supervision. To a certain degree, the PRC has established \na  statistical  system  for  monetary  policy  management  and  international  exchange  of \ninformation, including with the International Monetary Fund\u2019s International Financial Statistics, \non financial market stability and interbank markets. However, when PBC was the banking \nsupervisor it did not establish a comprehensive statistical system for CBRC supervisory \nneeds in general, or off-site surveillance with early-warning features in particular. Commercial \nbanks still prepare statistical tables without direct relevance to supervision.6 \n \n6.  The  statistical  system  for  banking  supervision  lacks  a  systematic  and  integral \napproach. This is reflected by the following:  \n \n(i)  Banking supervisory statistics are not comprehensively designed. Statistical \nindicators  do  not  adequately  reflect  banking  risks,  nor  do  they  meet \nsupervisory requirements. \n(ii)  Given  the  compartmental  structure,  many  PBC  and  CBRC  departments \nrepeatedly  request  similar  information  from  financial  institutions.  However, \nthese information requests are not consistent with each other and are not \nshared and used across PBC and CBRC departments. Data on RCCs and \nurban credit cooperatives are not reported to the headquarters of PBC and \nCBRC. \n(iii)  Commercial banks submit limited ad hoc information by branch or functional \ndepartment to their corresponding supervisory departments within the former \nPBC  or  CBRC  branches.  Coherent  and  consolidated  data  are  difficult  to \nacquire. Information on operational aspects and risk assessment, which is \nvaluable for supervisors, was not systematically collected. \n(iv)  Most information is on paper or diskette. A comprehensive database to allow \nquick inquiry and information sharing does not exist. \n(v)  Banking supervisors, security market and insurance market supervisors, and \nother  financial  market  policymakers  have  no  mechanism  for  information \nsharing.  \n \n7.  The 1997 Asian financial crisis was exacerbated partly by a lack of timely, frequent, \neasily accessible, and sufficiently disaggregated statistical information. The availability of \nsuch statistics and a key set of crisis-monitoring indicators could significantly reduce the \nvulnerability of financial markets and, thereby, the risk of crisis. The advances in accounting \nrules7 and adoption of internal risk ratings8 by commercial banks will require the supervisory \nauthority to adopt a more prudent statistical system. PRC banks will not implement the new \nBasel II minimum capital requirement immediately and will stay with the Basel I accord. As \npart of the fundamental change in the supervisory principle, from regulatory compliance to \nrisk-based supervision, CBRC has embraced the second and third pillar of Basel II. These \n                                                 \n6  For example, a set of information is still collected continually for implementation results of credit plans. The table \nwas designed in the 1950s when PBC was the sole bank owned by the Government and performed treasury \nfunctions. \n7  The Ministry of Finance issued the Accounting Principles for Finance Enterprises in 2001. \n8  The \u201cfive category\u201d risk-rating system has replaced the loan classification system based on aging. ", "      3  \nmeasures include regulatory supervision and market discipline through disclosure, as well as \nthe Core Principles of Effective Banking Supervision. Successful implementation of these \naccords and principles will require an efficient and effective statistical system that produces \naccurate and timely data. \n \n8.  CBRC has given high priority to establishing the new statistical system. The first \nCBRC meeting on the statistical system was held in September 2003, and a policy decision \nwas made to establish a risk-based supervision statistical system to comprehensively reflect \nthe credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks of commercial banks. The new statistical \nsystem will meet international standards and be based on consolidated financial institution \ndata. Static and dynamic statistical indicators will be collected to reflect commercial bank \noperations in local and foreign currency, and on- and off-balance-sheet activities. The new \nstatistical system should be able to meet the needs of supervisory authorities for off- and on-\nsite inspection, risk assessment, early warning, and information disclosure.  \n \n9.  CBRC has 15 departments. Banking Supervision Department I is responsible for \nsupervision of SOCBs and asset management companies; Banking Supervision Department \nII for JSCBs and city commercial banks; and Banking Supervision Department III for policy \nbanks, postal savings institutions, and foreign banking organizations. The Nonbank Financial \nInstitution  Supervision  Department  is  responsible  for  NBFIs;9  Cooperative  Finance \nSupervision Department for supervising rural and urban credit cooperatives; and Statistical \nDepartment for coordinating with line supervisory departments in supervisory data collection, \nanalysis, and information management. CBRC\u2019s Information Center is mandated to develop \nan integrated information system for CBRC. \n \n10.  Asian Development Bank's Operations and Strategy. One of the objectives of \nADB\u2019s PRC country operational strategy is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to reform the \nfinancial sector by strengthening CBRC\u2019s capability in prudential supervision and to facilitate \ncomplete  integration  of  the  financial  sector  into  the  global  financial  market.  ADB  has \nsupported strengthening banking supervisors\u2019 institutional capability through TAs.10 The first \ntwo were completed successfully, helped formulate a liquidity risk management model for the \nPBC Shanghai branch, helped draft the recently adopted banking laws, and proposed further \nlegal reforms in the banking sector. The third TA is being implemented. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA purpose is to strengthen the institutional capacities of CBRC as the banking \nregulator by establishing a statistics system that is consistent with  risk-based supervision \nprinciples and meets the needs of supervisory authorities for off-site surveillance and on-site \ninspection, risk assessment, early warning, and information disclosure. \n \n                                                 \n9  Excluding those conducting securities, futures, and insurance businesses. \n10 ADB. 1998.

The scope of the TA includes the following: \n \n(i)  Design statistical indicators, data submission criteria, and reporting formats for \nthe statistical system, which will cover information in accounting, credit risk, \nmarket risk, liquidity risk, capital and reserves, other banking business, and \nexternal information. \n \n(ii)  Prepare  instruction  books  and  conduct  training  activities  for  banking \nsupervisors  and  commercial  banks  to  understand  the  structural  and \noperational aspects of the new statistical system. \n \n(iii)  Recommend a prudent analytical framework for risk-based supervision based \non new statistical information. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total TA cost is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, comprising $275,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $325,000 equivalent in local currency costs. It is proposed that ADB \nfinance $400,000 equivalent, consisting of the entire foreign exchange costs and $125,000 \nequivalent in local costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding \nprogram. The Government will contribute $200,000 in kind for office space, counterpart staff, \ntransportation, and other services. Details of the cost estimate are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  CBRC\u2019s Statistical Department will be the Executing Agency. A leading group will be \nset up comprising senior management of CBRC and commercial banks. The director general \nof the Statistical Department will be the secretary of the leading group. A working group will \nbe set up, led by the director general and comprising technical representatives from CBRC \nsupervisory departments and commercial banks. The working group will be the consultants\u2019 \ncounterparts,  regularly  exchange  information  with  the  PBC  counterparts  regarding  TA \nimplementation progress, and ensure that the TA will contribute to PBC\u2019s and CBRC\u2019s joint \neffort  to  monitor  financial  crises  and  stabilize  the  financial  market.  CBRC\u2019s  Statistical \nDepartment will provide office space, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services to \nthe consultants, and will arrange meetings for them with agencies and organizations. A \nlimited number of senior CBRC statistics experts will train in countries with advanced risk-\nbased supervision statistics systems. CBRC staff members will also seek internships to gain \nexperience working side by side with foreign counterparts. \n \n15.  The TA will engage two international consultants for a total of 7 person-months, \nincluding a supervisory statistical system specialist (4 person-months) and an accounting and \nstatistics specialist (3 person-months), and two domestic consultants for a total of 8 person-\nmonths, including a supervisory statistical system specialist (4 person-months) and banking \noperation  and  training  specialist  (4  person-months).
