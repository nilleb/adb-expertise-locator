THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Energy Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program and \n(ii) a proposed policy-based loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 1 of the \nEnergy Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program. \n \n2.  The program will help Pakistan reduce financial, technical, and governance deficits in the \nenergy sector, which adversely impact sector sustainability and affordability and Pakistan\u2019s fiscal \nbalance and macroeconomic stability.1 It will (i) secure financial sustainability by controlling \naccumulation  and  addressing  reduction    of  circular  debt;  (ii)  strengthen  governance  by \nrationalizing a competitive market road map, the separation of policy and regulatory functions in \nhydrocarbons, the appointment of appellate tribunals, the implementation of multiyear tariffs and \nthe unbundling of the gas subsector; and (iii) reinforce infrastructure improvements through \nintegrated planning to facilitate public and private sector investment across the energy supply \nchain.2 \n \n3.  The program incorporates lessons from previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy-\nbased  programs  and  ADB\u2019s  sector  assistance  program  evaluation recommendations.3 It  is \naligned with the $6 billion extended fund facility (EFF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)4 \nand  ADB\u2019s  special  policy-based  loan  (SPBL),  the  Economic  Stabilization  Program.5 It  is \ndeveloped in consultation with key development partners, shares key energy policy actions with \nthe EFF and SPBL, and deepens those interventions through policy actions in subprograms 1\u20133. \nIt is linked with operational priority 2 (progress in gender equality), 3 (tackling climate change), \nand 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity) of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.6 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n4.  After experiencing gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4.8% on average in fiscal \nyears (FYs) 2015\u20132018, Pakistan\u2019s growth fell to 3.3% in FY2019 with unsustainable twin deficits: \nfiscal account deficit at 8.9% of GDP and current account deficit of 4.8% of GDP.7 Accumulated \nlosses of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have grown rapidly since FY2017, constraining \nthe government\u2019s fiscal position. Energy SOEs, which comprise roughly 60% of total SOE assets, \nhave been a major driver of these losses (footnote 5). The country\u2019s energy sector circular debt \nis a key constraint on reviving economic growth.8 The World Bank estimated that Pakistan\u2019s \npower subsector inefficiencies cost the economy $18 billion (6.5% of GDP) in 2015.9 The high \ncost  and  low  quality  of  electricity  supply  have  reduced  the  country\u2019s  trade  and  export \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Circular debt arises from payables to power generators and fuel suppliers. These are caused by electricity system \nlosses including commercial losses, non-payment of financial obligations by various types of end-users and \nregulatory deficiencies. Circular debt flow is the increase in payables towards suppliers in a certain period. Circular \ndebt stock is the accumulated liabilities towards suppliers and lenders. \n3  ADB. 2019.

Rising capacity payments (fixed \npayments to power plants to remain online and available) from rapid generation investments is \nanother challenge that requires deeper reforms and policy support from development partners. \n \n5.  Evolution of circular debt. The first major sector reforms, endorsed in 1992 after years \nof severe power shortages, covered four key elements: restructuring, private sector participation, \ncreation of an independent regulator, and competitive power generation. This led to unbundling \nof  the  vertically  integrated  utility,  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA). 12 \nFormulation of the National Power Policy and the announcement of incentives to attract private \ncapital in 1994 led to $5 billion in private investment and 4,500 megawatts (MW) of new capacity, \nmostly oil-based because of its short gestation period. However, furnace oil prices rose from \nPRs2,800 per ton in 1997 to PRs75,000 per ton in 2019, pushing up electricity generation costs \nsignificantly. To moderate tariff increases, the government provided tariff differential subsidies to \ncover about two-thirds of the population with lower electricity consumption level. However, the \ndeteriorating economic situation made it difficult for the government to sustain the subsidies, \nwhich  combined  with  high  technical  and  commercial  losses,  led  to  liquidity  crises  among \ndistribution companies (DISCOs) that were unable to fully pay for electricity supply to generation \ncompanies, independent power producers, and WAPDA,13 creating circular debt. By 2012, \ncircular debt totaled PRs460 billion. Moreover, the liquidity crisis led to inadequate investment in \ncritical infrastructure to meet growing electricity demand, resulting in capacity shortage of up to \n7,000 MW, or 30% of total capacity, and 12\u201316 hours of daily load shedding across Pakistan.14 \n \n6.  In 2013, the government paid off PRs480 billion of circular debt liabilities, giving a fresh \nstart to the power subsector, but was not able to address all the root causes. Circular debt \ncontinued to increase, although close government monitoring through the IMF\u2019s EFF for 2013\u2013\n201615 and ADB\u2019s SESRP slowed the pace. The sharp decline in international fuel prices in 2015 \nalso helped control new circular debt accumulation. After the IMF and ADB programs were \ncompleted, however, circular debt soared during the general elections cycle in 2018, when \ngeneration facilities operated as much as possible to minimize load shedding regardless of cost \nand insufficient tariff adjustments. In parallel, during 2016\u20132018, power generation capacity \nincreased  by  12,200  MW  through  foreign  direct  investments  and  government\u2013government \ncontracts. Without addressing the underlying liquidity issues in the subsector, circular debt, which \nstood at PRs729 billion in June 2017, had increased to PRs1,600 billion by June 2019. Of this, \n68% was from delayed tariff notifications, nearly 20% from the difference between the allowed \nand actual collections and losses by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), \nand nearly 10% from insufficient subsidies.16 \n \n10 ADB. 2019.

Washington, DC. \n16 Monthly reports of the Ministry of Energy. \n \n ", "3 \n7.  Inadequate tariffs and inefficient subsidies. Until 2018, NEPRA determined tariffs \n(NDTs) as the cost of supply based on petitions from DISCOs, and the government notified end \nuser tariffs with a mix of subsidies and NDTs. The gap between the notified tariffs and the NDTs \nwas effectively the subsidy. Through the EFF and SESRP, the government successfully reduced \nsubsidies from 1.8% of GDP in 2013 to 0.4% in 2017. However, the balance of payment and \nbudget crises in FY2018 caused the government to fall short in its subsidy payments to DISCOs \nbecause of insufficient budget allocations. The lack of subsidy payments during the record surge \nof generation costs added to the unprecedented level of circular debt. \n \n8.  A multiyear tariff mechanism was implemented through SESRP to reduce tariff-setting \ndelays.17 However, lawsuits filed by DISCOs against NEPRA in 2016, claiming that NDTs were \ninadequate and had underestimated system losses and overestimated collections, stalled tariff \nupdates and led to serious cash shortages for DISCOs. FY2015 tariffs were in place until 2018, \nduring which time generation costs continued to increase rapidly. Generation fuel price changes \nare adjusted automatically in tariffs, but no such mechanism exists for an increase in capacity \npayments, including its foreign exchange component, impact of which became larger as the \nPakistan rupee depreciated by nearly 48% against the United States dollar during 2016\u20132019. \nThe stalled tariff revisions for 3 years led to a large backlog of uncharged system cost, contributing \nsignificantly to the rise of circular debt. \n \n9.  High cost of generation. In addition to administrative issues with tariffs and subsidies, \nthe power generation mix contributed to high supply cost. Traditionally, incentive policies favored \ndevelopment of thermal power plants.18 In 1994, hydro power comprised more than 80% of the  \ngeneration mix, but by 2014, thermal power plants made up 73% of supply, increasing the power \nsubsector\u2019s reliance on imported fuel and vulnerability to balance of payment crises.19 Continuing \nto operate inefficient power plants because of the lack of monitoring of actual capacity (installed \nversus rated) and fuel availability exacerbates the issue. This will be partly addressed by the \nplanned retirement of nearly 4,000 MW of inefficient thermal power plants upto 2024 as their \npower purchase agreements expire. However, new power plants with 8,000 MW of generation \ncapacity will be added during 2019\u20132023, bringing total generation capacity to 35,500 MW that \nwill add to higher capacity payments. Renewable energy development, infrastructure retrofitting, \nand commercially sound operations will be key to reducing costs in the mid to long run.20 \n \n10.  Unsustainable losses. Electricity network losses and leakages also intensify the liquidity \ncrisis. DISCOs estimate of 18.3% transmission and distribution loss and 10.0% nonrecovery of \nbilled amounts leads to almost 29.0% revenue loss, 4% higher than FY2016 levels.21 This puts \nDISCOs in a negative spiral of limited investments and increasingly poor efficiency, making \nsystem losses a recurring cause of circular debt. \n \n11.  Weak  governance.  Despite  attempts  to  corporatize  power  SOEs,  the  corporate \ngovernance has remained weak and uneven across SOEs, losses have persisted, accumulating \nto over $2 billion in FY2018. The resulting lack of creditworthiness limits financing options and \nhas made power SOEs primarily reliant on sovereign financing for capital projects.22 With limited \n \n17 In this mechanism, the principles of regulating the returns and profits of licensees and the trajectory of the individual \ncost and revenue elements of the utilities are determined in advance for multiple years. \n18 The major incentive policies were the power policies of 1994, 2002, and 2015. The combined additional capacity \nbased on these policies is 21,500 MW. \n19 Of about 18,705 MW generation capacity being added in 2017\u20132022, 21.0% is hydro power, 8.5% is solar, 3.5% is \nlocal coal, 39.0% is imported coal, 11.0% is nuclear, 14.0% is regasified liquefied natural gas, and 3.0% is imported. \n20 About $35 billion is being invested in 15 generation and transmission projects with take-or-pay contracts. \n21 DISCOs\u2019 transmission and distribution losses for FY2018 were 18.32%, against the NEPRA target of 15.30%. \n22 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2018. Annual Budget document FY2018\u2013FY2019. Islamabad. \n ", "4 \ninvestments, DISCOs do not meet NDT\u2019s benchmark loss reduction and collection targets. \nReliance on sovereign financing has also led to heavy public sector  influence on their governance \nstructures, and board and management positions at DISCOs are held mainly by government-\naffiliated personnel with inadequate sector experience. Incumbents sitting on multiple boards of \nenergy entities exacerbate this issue. NEPRA publishes performance evaluation reports of key \nsector entities, but it lacks resources, and enforcing penalties and setting target loss levels in \nNDTs to encourage improvements remain the only corrective measures. \n \n12.  Lack of integrated planning. Since 1985, Pakistan has encountered intermittent energy \nsupply\u2013demand  imbalances  as  a  result  of  the  absence  of  integrated  planning.  This  has \nmanifested in an uneven generation mix, unbalanced switching costs between gas and power \nsubsectors, and mismatch between idle generation capacity and network availability. Despite rich \nsolar  and  wind  resources  throughout  the  country,  Pakistan  lacks  a  coordinated  policy  to \nincentivize and drive up solar and wind deployment and continues to rely on high cost imported \ngas-based generation that negatively affects affordability. Further, power subsector planning \nneeds to be coordinated with energy security policies, including the development of indigenous \ngas, coal, and hydropower resources. In the gas subsector, the large import of liquefied natural \ngas (LNG) since 2016 has helped curb the gas shortage, but its high price is posing a new \nchallenge. Without an integrated energy sector planning, Pakistan has not been able to take \nadvantage of its own resources to achieve an optimal mix of indigenous gas and LNG, and an \noptimal power generation mix from imported fuel, indigenous fuel, and renewable energy. \n \n13.  Previous reform efforts supported by ADB. The previous governments attempted to \nresolve such issues as tariff delays and high generation costs with ADB support through the \nAccelerating Economic Transformation Program (AETP) in 2008\u20132009 and the SESRP in 2014\u2013\n2017.23 Notable achievements of AETP include automatic fuel cost adjustment in tariffs and \ndetailed analysis of causes of circular debt.  Under SESRP, tariff rationalization and debt service \nsurcharges were implemented, which were key in reducing subsidies. Three DISCOs received \nmultiyear tariffs under new tariff guidelines. The single buyer in the power subsector was made \ninto an independent entity and designated as the country\u2019s first market operator. The government \namended  the  1997  NEPRA  Act  substantially  and  clarified  the  government\u2019s  policy-making \nfunctions and NEPRA\u2019s regulatory functions, especially in tariff setting. The amendments also \nprovided the foundation for an electricity trading market and an appellate tribunal as a dedicated \ndispute settlement mechanism for NEPRA decisions. \n \n14.  However, the IMF program went off-track in 2010, hampering completion of the energy sector \npolicy actions of AETP such as its circular debt resolution plan.  After SESRP, tariff reforms did not \nyield results as court cases stalled new tariff notifications until 2019. The circular debt management \nplan developed in SESRP did not anticipate the surge of generation costs fully and relied too heavily \non efficiency improvements and sales proceeds from DISCO privatization. Yet privatization proved to \nbe more challenging than the government\u2019s expectation. NEPRA Act amendments would have \nprovided new tools to control circular debt, but they were not enacted until April 2018. The combination \nof these factors set the previous reform efforts back, resulting in the current liquidity crisis. \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n15.  The new government has developed reform action plans in its new electricity policy and \nthe concept of integrated energy planning. A large part of these efforts will be on optimizing the \n \n23 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors. Proposed Program Cluster \nand Loans for Subprogram 1 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Accelerating Economic Transformation \nProgram. Manila; and footnote 11. \n \n ", "5 \nuse of the tools that were developed in previous efforts. ADB will support this reform through the \nproposed programmatic approach with three subprograms during 2019\u20132022. In developing the \nprogram, ADB has undertaken multiple diagnostic and analytical studies since 2018.24 The \nfindings recommended prioritizing the recurring financial sustainability issues to streamline the \ntariff notification cycle; strengthening energy accounting; and reducing generation costs by \ninducting solar, wind, and hydropower without capacity charges as well as by addressing the \nsector\u2019s governance and infrastructure constraints. The program\u2019s three pillars are financial \nsustainability (including actions for climate challenge), governance, and infrastructure.25 \n \n16.  Reform area 1: financial sustainability improved. Through the programmatic approach, \nactions in this pillar will aim to address inefficient tariffs and subsidies, high generation costs, system \nlosses, and lack of integrated planning. While accumulated circular debt poses a threat to the \neconomy, the immediate priority is to stop further accumulation, or the flow, of circular debt and \nfocus on the stock reduction through the subsequent subprograms. In subprogram 1, a series of \ntariff notifications in 2019, adjusted a backlog of PRs469 billion. Further, the tariffs are now based \non the new uniform tariff mechanism under NEPRA Act amendments, which incorporate budgeted \nsubsidies and cross-subsidization among DISCOs to help control sector deficits. A new circular debt \nreduction plan based on these tariff mechanisms, a historic level of system efficiency improvements, \nand an antitheft program that has recovered PRs89 billion since November 2018, among others, \nwas  developed  to  monitor  quarterly  targets  and  progress.  These  efforts  and  timely  subsidy \npayments reduced circular debt flow from PRs38 billion per month in August 2018 to PRs21 billion \nper month in August 2019. When fully implemented the flow is expected to be further reduced to \nwithin PRs6 billion per month by 30 June 2021. Under this plan, the government also aims to reduce \nsubsidies from 0.56% of GDP in FY2020 to 0.40% during FY2021\u2013FY2023 through better targeting. \nThe plan also includes indicative priority areas to address stock of circular debt, which is highlighted \nin para. 17 below. The Renewable Energy Policy 2019, assisted by ADB and other partners, targets \n20% (10,000 MW) renewable energy capacity by 2025 and 30% (15,000 MW) by 2030, and aims \nto shift the generation mix to contain only 15% imported fuel by 2030. \n \n17.  In subprogram 2, the government plans to further amend the NEPRA Act to introduce an \nautomatic  mechanism  for  updating  power  generation  costs  in  tariffs  each  quarter  without \ngovernment notification and instituting surcharges for balancing cost of supply. Generation costs \ncomprise more than 75% of end user tariffs currently, and the automated mechanism will prevent \nthe backlog of system costs even if tariff notifications are delayed. The government and NEPRA \nalso aim to notify FY2021 tariffs before the fiscal year starts in July 2020, correcting the tariff \nnotification schedule for the first time. With such progress, the circular debt reduction plan will be \nexpanded to reduce circular debt stock. This may include (i) using the sales proceeds of some \ngeneration assets, (ii) divesting power subsector transmission and distribution SOEs through \ninitial public offerings, (iii) rolling tariff subsidies into social assistance program targeting only the \npoorest households, and (iv) converting portions of stock into public debt. The National Electricity \nPolicy and Plan will be approved as the foundation of integrated planning. \n18.  By subprogram 3, in parallel with monitoring of circular debt reduction plan targets, \nmultiyear tariffs are planned to be introduced for all DISCOs to help NEPRA determine tariffs on \ntime. A mechanism to link DISCOs\u2019 revenue margins with their performance is expected to \n \n24 Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The \nassessment is based on findings from ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the \nUpdate on Energy Sector Plan. Manila. \n25 The sequencing of reforms under each area is in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. Subprogram 1 will contribute $45 \nmillion to climate mitigation financing through declining carbon dioxide emissions by implementing a renewable \nenergy policy ($15 million) and an unaccounted-for-gas reduction program ($30 million). \n ", "6 \nencourage efficiency improvements and provide more cash resources to control circular debt. \nApproval of the integrated energy plan (2020\u20132047) will help the government with energy planning \nand optimize energy systems, even beyond the scope of the programmatic approach. \n \n19.  Reform  area  2:  institutional  and  regulatory  governance  strengthened.  For \nsubprogram  1,  NEPRA  concluded  public  consultations  for  the  market-oriented  electricity \nsubsector financial settlement model, which was developed with ADB support and is a key step \nin this continued effort since SESRP.26 A cabinet committee approved the privatization plan of \ntwo regasified LNG-based power plants whose proceeds can help retire part of the circular debt \nstock. The Ministry of Energy (MOE) approved and initiated the separation of policy and regulatory \nfunctions in the petroleum subsector to streamline the sector\u2019s business processes and promote \nmore investments. The MOE and the Ministry of Law and Justice initiated the establishment of an \nappellate tribunal as a dispute resolution mechanism for NEPRA decisions. The government also \napproved the requirement of female representation on SOE boards. \n \n20.  Subprograms 2 and 3 will induce professional management to improve the operational \nand financial parameters of sector entities, which will also facilitate private investments and \nownership. Competitive selection of management personnel will raise the chances of appointing \nskilled managers. The separation of the technical and commercial segments in two DISCOs and \nthe completion of the regasified LNG power plant privatization will pave the way for management \ncontracts and other forms of private sector participation. The MOE\u2019s gas sector restructuring plan \nwill be a plan for the unbundling of the gas sector into transmission and distribution companies, \nthird-party access to gas transmission lines, and eventual private ownership in gas companies. \nThe  appellate  tribunal  for  NEPRA  decisions  will  be  made  operational,  and  results  will  be \nmonitored by MOE.  \n \n21.

While  the  program  will  be  complemented  by  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment portfolio and pipeline on transmission and distribution expansion,27 it will also promote \nprivate investments in energy supply infrastructure.

It has also revised the 2012 incentive \npolicy to streamline regulatory approvals and encourage more rigorous oil and gas production \ninvestments to reduce the need for imported fuel for energy and transport. \n \n22.  Subprograms 2 and 3 will focus on off-grid and rural electrification, which constitutes \npower supply to about 30% of the population; continued auction of oil and gas concessions to \nreduce dependency on imported fuel for power generation and energy needs; implementation of \nnet metering in five DISCOs; 28 and modernization of the electricity system operator, the National \nPower Control Center. \n23.  Choice of programmatic approach. The programmatic approach will provide multiyear \npolicy engagement aligned with the EFF, SPBL, and other development partner programs. \nContinued engagement is key as complex reforms take multiple years to implement and yield \nresults. Subprograms 2 and 3 will be designed as new lending programs based on indicative \n \n26 ADB. 2014.

ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s value addition is based on its long-term engagement with \npolicy-based and investment loans in Pakistan. The program builds on ADB\u2019s earlier policy \ninterventions. Actions such as uniform tariffs and the appellate tribunal are based on the NEPRA \nAct amendments supported by SESRP and the circular debt reduction plan incorporates lessons \nfrom previous plans (para. 16). Sector assistance program evaluation recommendations to \nimprove financial sustainability, strengthen sector governance and integrated planning, and \nsupport physical and technological investments became the program\u2019s reform areas. An ADB-\nassisted study on sector reforms provided the basis for formulating policy actions (footnote 24). \n \n25.  ADB can provide comprehensive support, and the government can identify and sequence \nkey reforms with support from ADB\u2019s policy engagement from the programmatic approach. ADB \nwill support reform implementation through technical assistance (TA) in areas such as developing \nand monitoring the progress of the circular debt reduction plan, implementing the market-based \nfinancial settlement model, and establishing the appellate tribunal.29 ADB\u2019s pipeline loan projects \nare aligned with the identified infrastructure needs and supplement reform actions (footnote 27). \n \n26.  Development partner coordination. ADB is taking the lead in providing an energy-\nsector-focused policy program, which has been coordinated with and complements projects and \nprograms of key development partners. The program underpins energy sector reforms in the IMF \nEFF and SPBL by addressing structural constraints and their negative impact on economic \ngrowth. Policy actions on tariff notification, the circular debt reduction plan, and automatic \nquarterly adjustments are in the EFF and SPBL, which support the upstream aspects of these \nactions, while the programmatic approach will further support downstream implementation and \nmonitoring. All three reform areas are supported by ADB\u2019s TA projects, and the programmatic \napproach allows ADB to provide follow-up support for deepening reform initiatives. The circular \ndebt reduction plan, jointly agreed by ADB, IMF and the World Bank, has been approved by the \nMinistry of Energy. The plan is endorsed by the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet, \nwhich will monitor its implementation. The debt sustainability analysis, program monitoring, and \nthe sequencing of disbursements of the subprograms have been fully coordinated with the IMF. \n30 ADB has supported the preparation of the National Electricity Policy 2019, the Renewable \nEnergy Policy 2019, and the 25-year Integrated Energy Plan with inputs from other development \npartners. The World Bank is preparing a development policy credit for approval in 2020 that \nincludes policy actions to reduce circular debt stock to complement the ADB program. ADB is \nalso coordinating with the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the German development bank, the \nFrench Development Agency, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency on the design of \ntheir complementary programs and on potential cofinancing plans. \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n27.  The key impact of the program is reduced financial, technical, and governance deficits in \nthe energy sector. By 2024 and with successful program implementation, new accumulation of \ncircular debt per year will be reduced from PRs450 billion in FY2019 to PRs50 billion, accumulated \npayables will drop from PRs800 billion in 2018 to less than PRs250 billion, and the weighted \naverage electricity generation cost will fall from $0.097 per kilowatt-hour in 2019 to $0.070 per \n \n29 ADB. 2019.

The appellate tribunal is expected to resolve 60% of cases on NEPRA decisions \nwithin 6 months; such cases are currently taken to court, where decisions may take years. \n \n28.  Under the circular debt reduction plan, the government expects improvement in DISCOs\u2019 \ncollections from 94.7% in 2019 to 99.4% in 2022 and in losses in six distribution companies by \n1% annually, generating additional revenues of PRs118 billion by end FY2023. Better subsidy \ntargeting is expected to reduce subsidy (para. 16). \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n29.  The average GDP growth rate for FY2019\u2013FY2024 is forecast to average 3.9%, with \ninflation expected to rise to an average of 9.1%, which will continue to constrain government \nfinances. The fiscal deficit is estimated to be 6.8% of GDP in FY2020 (about $16 billion) and \nexpected to remain high until FY2021. The government\u2019s external financing needs are expected \nto be $29.9 billion in FY2020 and continue to increase through FY2024 (footnote 4). Of this, the \nIMF will provide $2.4 billion and ADB will contribute $2.1 billion in FY2020 (footnote 5). Sector-\nspecific requirements constitute $600 million per year by implementing an energy (power and \ngas)  loss  reduction  programs  through  expansion  and  rehabilitation  of  downstream  energy \ninfrastructure. \n \n30.  To support growing development financing needs, ADB proposes to provide $1 billion of \npolicy-based  loans  through  a  programmatic  approach  to  be  implemented  through  three \nsubprograms. For subprogram 1, the government has requested a concessional loan of $300 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace \nperiod and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe Export-Import Bank of Korea has confirmed $80 million cofinancing for subprogram 1, and \ncofinancing options will be explored for subprograms 2 and 3. Financing under the proposed \nprogram is integrated into the IMF\u2019s debt analysis.31 The development policy letter from the \ngovernment is in Appendix 3. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency and responsible for overall program \nmonitoring and reporting, and the MOE and NEPRA will be the implementing agencies. Two TA \nprojects will support the policy actions (footnotes 24 and 29). The programmatic approach will be \nimplemented from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021, with subprogram 1 to be disbursed in \none tranche. Based on ADB\u2019s assessment of documents received, all subprogram 1 policy actions \nhave been completed, including with respect to policy actions 1 and 2 which are a subset of the \nEFF structural benchmarks and SPBL policy actions. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will \nbe withdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to \ntime). The loan closing date for subprogram 1 is 30 June 2020. \n \n \n31 The IMF program includes general budget support financing plans of the government, including this programmatic \napproach and lending programs of all other development partners for 2019\u20132025. The Fiscal Responsibility and Debt \nLimitation Act 2005 of Pakistan (amended in 2016) allows the government to borrow above the 60% of GDP public \ndebt ceiling by providing the justification for additional borrowing in the annual debt policy statement. \n \n ", "9 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s governance risk assessment found such risks as (i) weak political support for and \ngovernment ownership of sensitive reforms and (ii) weak institutional capacity.32 The fiduciary \nsystems assessment found one important area of concern: key reforms may not be implemented \npromptly because of budget constraints. While no major resource mismanagement risks at the \nimplementing level could be discerned, areas relating to the sector\u2019s institutional capacity and financial \nsustainability were targeted for capacity development in the TA projects and the program\u2019s policy \nactions. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government and will be followed by the program. Pakistan is on the Financial Action Task Force \ngray list and will continue to implement the anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism reforms \nagreed in the action plan with the task force. The government is acting against corruption, with \nmonitoring and reporting by the Public Accounts Committee of the parliament. \n \nB.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  While the consumption poverty rate in Pakistan declined from 50.4% in FY2006 to 24.3% \nin FY2016,33 the multidimensional poverty rate remains high at 38.8% and has stark regional and \nurban\u2013rural disparities: 54.6% in rural areas and 9.4% in urban areas.34 Higher energy prices \ncoupled  with  subdued  growth  and  increased  inflation  and  unemployment  exacerbate  the \nvulnerabilities of the poor.35 Industrial and commercial sectors are affected by higher tariffs and \nunreliable power supply, and the hardest hit are the small and medium-sized enterprises that \nemploy more than 70% of workforce. Policy reforms will reduce generation costs by promoting \nlow-carbon solutions, and lower technical and commercial losses. Encouraging private sector \nparticipation in sustained and reliable oil and gas production investments will increase job \nopportunities in the energy sector directly and indirectly. Further, expanded energy access by \ndeveloping a 5-year rural and off-grid electrification plan for underdeveloped districts to reduce \ntime poverty of rural women\u2014who comprise more than 50% of the workforce\u2014will allow longer \nhours for study and skills training programs and generally improved health and quality of life. \n \n34.  Pakistan\u2019s female labor force participation rate is among the lowest globally: only 24.6% \nof women have access to formal labor markets.36 Women\u2019s lack of access to formal labor markets, \nlow literacy levels, limited mobility, and lack of land ownership and assets make them more \nvulnerable to economic shocks. Categorized as having some gender elements, subprogram 1 \nhas two key policy actions with strong gender impacts: the MOE has (i) completed consultations \nand submitted the National Electricity Policy for approval by provinces, with measures to improve \nfemale employment in the sector; and (ii) implemented the policy that requires at least one female \nboard member in public sector enterprises, including DISCOs. \n \nC.
