THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nwithout guarantee to Laraib Energy Limited (Laraib) for the New Bong Escape Hydropower \nProject (the Project) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. If approved, the Project will be the \nfirst private hydroelectric (hydel) power generation project in Pakistan financed by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) via its private sector operations. It will also be the first private sector \ncofinancing between ADB and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). \n \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  Laraib, which was formed in August 1995 by a group of private investors, applied for and \nreceived a letter of interest to develop the Project, under a build-own-operate-transfer public\u2013\nprivate partnership scheme, and to carry out a feasibility study. Laraib was issued a letter of \nsupport on 18 May 1996 allowing it to develop the Project, negotiate a tariff with the Pakistan \nWater and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and proceed to finance, build, and operate \nthe Project. Following delays largely attributable to the economic downturn and to disputes with \nthermal independent power producers (IPPs) in the late 1990s, the company has recently signed \nproject agreements with the Government of  Pakistan, the government of Azad Jammu and \nKashmir (GOAJK), and their relevant power sector entities, including agreements pertaining to \nwater use, power purchase, and government approvals and undertakings. \n \n3.  The situation in the power sector in Pakistan has improved markedly over the last few \nyears, and it is today deemed an attractive sector for investment by both local and overseas \nsources. This can be attributed to the resolution of disputes between WAPDA, the Government, \nand the IPPs; continued efforts at sector reform; a dramatic reversal of the capacity oversupply \nprevalent  in  the  mid  to  late  1990s;  and  very  robust  economic  growth.  This  turnaround  is \nevidenced by the proposed new IPP development, proposed expansions of existing IPPs, and \nIPP refinancing activity. Private hydel development is particularly encouraged today as it will \nadd much-needed generation capacity in an environmentally acceptable way, rebalance the \nhydro/thermal generation mix (all current IPP generation is thermal), and exploit indigenous \nrenewable resources, all of which are consistent with the Government\u2019s power sector policies. \nPakistan has a strong comparative advantage in hydel power generation, and the Project should \nhelp the country to realize that advantage within the private sector. The Project, being at an \nadvanced  stage  of  development  and  already  specifically  featured  in  WAPDA\u2019s  least-cost \nGeneration Expansion Plan, merits ADB\u2019s particular support. \n \n4.  The Project is at an advanced stage of development with its contractual structure largely in \nplace.  The  Project\u2019s  original  developers  have  now  attracted  a  major  international  corporate \ninvestor in the form of Ranhill Berhad of Malaysia to cosponsor the Project, demonstrating that the \nclimate for private sector investment generally, and for private power development particularly, \nand for private hydel projects specifically, has vastly improved. The conditions are now felt to be \nhighly supportive for realizing this landmark transaction.  \n \n5.  The financing of the Project is being closely coordinated with IDB, and it is expected that \nADB and IDB will lead the financing with similar participation (up to $37.3 million each). This will \nbe IDB\u2019s first private sector project financing in Pakistan, and it will be the first private sector \ncofinancing between ADB and IDB.  \n \n ", "2   \n6.  The Project is also in line with ADB\u2019s policy for the energy sector in Pakistan1 where the \nfocus is on structural reform, privatization, cleaner fuels, and renewable energy, as well as with \nADB\u2019s multisector rehabilitation and improvement project for AJ&K,2 which has an important \npower sector component. The Project will help to strengthen the role of NTDC within the power \nsector (a role that ADB has strongly supported3), as well as help to stabilize the power network \nby  building  generation  in  the  north  of  the  country.  The  Project  may  also  encourage  the \ndevelopment  of  the  market  for  certified  emissions  reduction  credits.  The  central  and  local \ngovernments have confirmed both their support for the Project and for ADB\u2019s participation.  \n \n7.  Substantial due diligence has been undertaken, and ADB has been heavily involved in \nstructuring this transaction.  The Fact-Finding and Initial Due Diligence Mission was fielded from \n17 to 18 February 2004, and the Project received concept clearance on 6 October 2004. The \nmain Appraisal Mission was fielded during the last week of November 2004. In addition, the \nADB project team joined an IDB-led due diligence mission and has participated in numerous \nsubsequent due diligence and negotiation missions to Pakistan and Malaysia. \n \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Power Sector in Pakistan  \n \n1.  Demand and Supply \n8.  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  consumption  increased  at  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  of \n4.84% from 1999 to 2003, with faster rates of growth registered among certain classes of users \nsuch as domestic, commercial, and industrial. Future electricity consumption is expected to \nexceed recent economic growth rates of about 6%, with WAPDA registering unit sales growth of \n8.6% in 2004. Strong economic growth is also expected to contribute to greater levels of per \nannum  per  capita  consumption  of  electricity  (413  kilowatt-hours  [kWh]  compared  to  the \nPhilippines\u2019 497 kWh and Thailand\u2019s 1,414 kWh) and thus magnify demand growth. This growth \nin demand has essentially erased a significant capacity overhang to the point where, today, load \nshedding and other adverse economic impacts of declining reserve margins relative to peak \ndemand are becoming pronounced. WAPDA shed 676 gigawatt-hours (GWh) from July 2003 to \nJune 2004, slightly more than the annual generation of 426 GWh expected from the Project. \nThe situation is not helped by significant levels of technical and non-technical losses and the \nlack of recent sizable investment in generation and transmission and distribution systems to \nmeet  expected  demand  (notwithstanding  the  recent  completion  of  the  Ghazi  Barotha \nHydropower Project). \n \n9.  Total installed power generating capacity in Pakistan amounts to 19,252 megawatts \n(MW), of which 11,196 MW is provided by WAPDA (58.1%), 5,808 MW by IPPs (30.2%), 1,756 \nMW by KESC (9.1%) and 30 MW by AJ&K Hydel (0.2%), the remainder being government \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2002.

Manila \n(TA No. 4635- PAK). \n ", "  3\nowned nuclear (462 MW or 2.4%).  Hydroelectric generation capacity represents about 6,491 \nMW, or 34% of total installed generation capacity. \n \n10.  Thermal generation (excluding nuclear) is fueled by oil (24%), natural gas (75%), and \ncoal (under 1%).  Hydel generation, which is currently all in the public sector, represents about \n34% of the existing generation capacity, but that capacity of approximately 6,491 MW uses less \nthan 20% of the estimated hydropower resources of the country. In addition, hydel generation \nhas declined relative to total generation as the large capacity additions in the mid to late 1990s \nwere all oil and gas fired IPPs. This trend is considered unfavorable by the Government and \nWAPDA, which prefer a more balanced thermal/hydro generation mix. Other considerations are \ncost and environmental issues and benefits specific to hydel. Like other Himalayan countries, \nPakistan has a significant comparative advantage in hydel power. \n \n11.  Pakistan is expected to face significant capacity shortfalls relative to peak demand as \nearly as 2006. With seasonal electricity consumption seeing peak consumption occurring in the \nsummer months, the country had about a 1,215 MW surplus in 2004, representing an 8% reserve \nmargin, which is considered tight. This surplus is expected to decline to only 440 MW at the end of \n2005. If no capacity is added, the surplus will turn to deficit from 2006 (minus 411 MW), and the \nGovernment\u2019s Private Power and Infrastructure Board projects that the deficit will exceed 4,000 \nMW by 2009. WAPDA, whose system delivers 87% of total electricity consumption, projects and \nconfirms a similar deficit. To address this precarious situation, WAPDA has developed a least-cost \nGeneration Expansion Plan (2006-2010) in which this Project is featured as adding 79 MW of \nhydel capacity in 2009. The plan is designed to add some 3,557 MW of new capacity in that time \nperiod (i.e., the next 4 years) via 19 separate projects. Even assuming these projects go ahead \nand are implemented on time, the deficit in generation relative to peak demand will still amount to \n330MW in 2006 and 2,376 MW in 2009 (please refer to Appendix 1). It is in this context that the \nProject is being developed and ADB\u2019s support is being sought.4\n \n2.  Sector Regulations and Reform  \n12.  The power sector, which encompasses the generation, transmission, and distribution of \nelectricity, is governed and regulated under the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority \n(NEPRA) Act of 1997. NEPRA, which was constituted under this Act as an independent entity, \nis exclusively empowered under the act and related rules to regulate all facets of the power \nsector.5  NEPRA  is  thus  empowered  to  grant  licenses  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution; to approve tariffs, rates, and charges across the sector; and to establish uniform \nindustry  performance  via  codes  and  standards,  which  it  enforcements.  NEPRA,  although \nmandated as an independent entity, is governed by a chairman and four members who are all \nappointed by the Government, with the members recommended by and representing provincial \ninterests.  ADB  supported  NEPRA\u2019s  capacity  building  in  2001  and  2003  with  technical \nassistance.6  \n \n                                                 \n4\n  The data provided in paras. 8\u201311 is from WAPDA and/or Laraib. \n5\n  There are some exceptions related to self-generation, or generation undertaken directly by provinces for within-\nprovince distribution, provided that provinces set up their own distribution networks and are not connected to the \nnational grid. It is worth noting that NEPRA does not have jurisdiction in AJ&K, but does over NTDC. However, the \nInspectorate of Electricity of AJ&K, which assumes the role of regulator in AJ&K, voluntarily follows the rules, \nregulations, and tariffs set by NEPRA. It is understood that, in respect of the Project, the primary role of the \nInspectorate is to issue the standard consents under the terms of the Electricity Act 1938 (see also footnote 11). \n6\n  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Institutional Capacity Building of the \nNational Electric Power Authority. Manila \n ", "4   \n13.  Power  sector  policies  and  related  legislative  frameworks  are  developed  and \nimplemented by the Government via the Ministry of Water and Power. The Government initiated \nthe process of power sector reforms and restructuring in the early 1990s on the advice of the \nWorld Bank. The power sector restructuring and reform process developed through various \nstages and policies, such as the Power Policy 1994, Hydel Policy 1995, Transmission Line \nPolicy 1995, Power Policy 1998, and Power Policy 2002. These were designed, to a large \nextent, to attract private sector participation in a newly restructured power sector. In addition, \nthe NEPRA Act was promulgated to provide the overall regulatory umbrella for the sector. The \nGovernment  is  today  unbundling  WAPDA  into  various  independent  entities.  The  broad \nobjectives  of  all  these  policies  have  been  to  inculcate  sector-wide  efficiencies  through \ncompetitive generation, transmission, and distribution with appropriate independent regulatory \noversight;  rationalize  prices  and  subsidies;  and  encourage  private  capital  formation  and \ninvestment to meet growing electricity demand. ADB has directly supported these endeavors.7\n \n14.  As a result, the power sector is in transition and is today semi-privatized and semi-\nderegulated. The sector has historically been characterized by very significant Government \ncontrol via the WAPDA and KESC monopolies (which function as vertically integrated utilities \nencompassing generation, transmission, and distribution) and by significant inefficiency (with \nlosses in excess of 25%) and inability to meet demand. This characterization, at least in terms \nof outright Government control, has changed over the last decade with significant private sector-\nled generation via IPPs, which together represent in excess of 30% of total generation capacity. \nSignificant reforms have taken place to break WAPDA\u2019s power assets into discreet generation \nand distribution units, and to place WAPDA\u2019s transmission assets into a single corporatized \nentity,  NTDC.  NTDC  will  assume  the  additional  function  of  acting  as  the  single  buyer  of \nwholesale generation from multiple companies in the market (but excluding KESC) for onward \ntransmission and sale to distribution entities, in addition to responsibilities as market and system \noperator (as an interim step to a fully competitive electricity market). This single-buyer model \nnow being implemented will ultimately evolve into a multiple-buyer and multiple-seller regime in \nwhich generators and distributors can contract directly. However, this development is expected \nto take quite some time, and it is not expected in the foreseeable future that a full merchant \nmarket will replace long-term structures under the power purchase agreement (PPA) signed \nwith NTDC on 16 April 2004.  PPAs are felt to be the best way of delivering needed power to the \nsystem. It is important to note that existing IPPs, and those already approved and under \ndevelopment  will  be  grandfathered  under  existing  legislation  preserving  their  contractual \nframeworks including tariff structures, which in itself promotes policy consistency. The role and \nresponsibilities of NTDC are more fully described in Appendix 2.  \n \n15.  GOAJK wishes to develop its hydropower resources to meet some 300 MW of demand, \nwhich is currently being met from the national grid. AJ&K is rich in hydropower resources, and \nthus GOAJK has prioritized hydropower development to meet its own load requirements and \ncreate an exportable surplus.8 So far there has been only limited success with small-scale \nprojects, and a total capacity of some 36 MW in operation. GOAJK adopted the Government\u2019s \nHydel Policies of 1995 and 1998 and is developing its own power policy partly based on the \nPower Policy 2002 to attract and enable private sector development. GOAJK has developed \n                                                 \n7\n  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for Energy Sector Restructuring Program. Manila \n8\n  GOAJK\u2019s Electricity Department/Inspectorate has administrative control over the development, generation, supply, \nand distribution of hydel and thermal power in AJ&K, including the administration of relevant Government Acts, \nand liaison with WAPDA. GOAJK has specifically tasked the Hydro Electric Board, a unit of GOAJK, with \nresponsibility for both public and private hydel projects and with implementing the Government\u2019s hydel policy \nthrough the private sector. \n ", "  5\nspecial hydel concessions, such as leasing state-owned land at attractive rates and attractive \ntax and levy incentives. GOAJK is also planning a power highway to disperse power from \nremote  hydel  sites  as well  as  the  development  of  its  own  grid  to distribute  the  electricity \ngenerated. The Project is not dependant on these efforts as it will connect directly to an NTDC \ntransmission line. \n \n16.  The Project is being developed under the Government\u2019s Hydel Policy 1995, which offers \nconcessions, facilities, and incentives to the private sector to design, build, own, operate, and \nultimately transfer back to government hydropower projects. In 1998, the Government allowed \nthe continued implementation of the Project under the Hydel Policy 1995 subject to negotiation \nand agreement of the tariff with WAPDA (or its successors). These tariffs have been agreed as \ndescribed more fully in section C and are viewed by the Government (including NEPRA, NTDC \nand PPIB), GOAJK, and the private sector as being highly competitive. \n \n17.  It should be noted that several of the thermal IPPs that were promoted largely in the \nearly 1990s faced considerable difficulties both because some of them were arguably politically \nmotivated and due to an acute power surplus in the latter part of the 1990s. However, all of the \nsubstantive disputes between the Government and the IPPs have been satisfactorily resolved \nwith some tariff renegotiation, a change in government, and with the disappearance of the \npower surplus. The existing IPPs are now successfully operating, and a number are looking at \nexpansions and/or refinancing on improved terms. Even should further problems occur with the \nIPPs (a situation that is considered unlikely by both the Government and the IPPs), the Project, \nwith its low tariffs and preferred merit order characteristics, is expected to be one of the least \nvulnerable to any change in political sentiment. \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n \n1.  Country Strategy \n18.  The  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP),  approved  in  May  2002  and  updated  in \nSeptember 2004, aims to support poverty reduction in Pakistan through specific interventions in \nthe  following  three  areas:  (i)  supporting  good  governance  including  sector  reform;  (ii) \nsustainable  pro-poor  growth  with  infrastructure  and  rural  development  and  employment \ngeneration; and (iii) inclusive social development. The CSP acknowledges and supports the \npriority that the Government accords to developing economic infrastructure as an engine for \nhigher growth and poverty reduction in the medium term, and it recognizes that, given the \nconstraints  on  public  sector  resources  and  capacity,  the  private  sector  needs  to  play  an \nimportant and growing role in infrastructure development. In particular, the CSP calls for ADB to \nredirect its ordinary capital resource lending towards infrastructure projects that will have the \ngreatest impact on growth and poverty reduction. One of the identified priorities is addressing \ncritical gaps in the power sector as well as facilitating public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) for \ninfrastructure development. Experience has also shown that the private sector can reduce the \ncost of project development by some 30\u201350% compared with Government-developed projects. \nThis can be seen from the publicly financed Chashma and Ghazi Barotha hydropower projects, \nwhere cost escalation and delays significantly increased costs. \n \n19.  To support private sector involvement in infrastructure development, ADB will focus on \nproviding assistance in (i) the development of a strategy to determine the role of the private sector \nin financing, constructing, operating, and maintaining infrastructure through the formation of PPPs; \n(ii) the creation of policy, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to support such PPPs; and (iii) \nthe  development  of  pilot  partnership  models  for  specific  projects.  Under  its  private  sector \n ", "6   \ndevelopment strategy, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is directed to provide direct \nassistance to private sector entities through investments, lending, and guarantees, principally for \nprojects in the power, water, transport, and oil and gas sectors.  \n \n2.  Energy Sector Strategy \n20.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy9 designates ADB\u2019s operational priorities as (i) reducing \npoverty by, among other ways, creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth; \n(ii) promoting private sector involvement by restructuring the energy sector and creating an \nenabling environment for private investors; (iii) addressing regional and global environmental \nimpacts; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. In particular, the strategy strongly encourages \nADB\u2019s  interventions  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the  energy  sector  to  take \nadvantage of the higher operational efficiencies that private sector operators can achieve and to \nmeet the large capital requirements of energy infrastructure. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy \npromotes a shift to cleaner fuels and processes. The strategy also encourages the liberalization \nof markets and elimination of cross subsidies.  \n \n3.  Project Consistency with Asian Development Bank Strategies \n21.  The Project promotes and is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country and energy sector strategies \nand  its  thematic  priorities  of  economic  development,  private  sector  development,  good \ngovernance,  and  environmental  protection.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  economic \ndevelopment and reform of the power sector, which are vital for economic growth and efficiency. \nThe Project will promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, freeing up \ngovernment resources for other types of expenditure. The Project will enable NTDC to distribute \nelectricity to the consumer, where demand is currently not fully met, and will help meet the \nenergy needs of the industrial and commercial sectors, thus enabling economic growth. The \nProject will also help to stabilize the grid and promote the lowering of system losses, given its \nproximity to the load center. The Project will use clean energy, which is essential for sustainable \ndevelopment.  The  Project  may  be  eligible  for  certified  emissions  reduction  credits,  upon \napplication, under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, which would help to promote the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) market.10 ADB has supported the Government\u2019s efforts in \nrestructuring the power sector to enable it to attract more private sector investments. ADB\u2019s \nfinancial  assistance  to  the  Project  will  represent  a  natural  and  consistent  extension  of  its \nprescribed policy support to Pakistan.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9\n  ADB. 2000.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Sponsors and Ownership  \n \n22.  The Project was conceived and developed by a group of private investors. These private \ninvestors incorporated Laraib Energy Limited as a public limited company to undertake the Project \npursuant to a Letter of Support issued by the Government of Pakistan and dated 18 May 1996. \nMr.  Khalid  Faizi,  who  leads  Laraib  as  chief  executive  officer,  and  his  co-investors  financed \nLaraib\u2019s long development process and have managed to negotiate a financially sustainable \nproject that meets  NTDC\u2019s capacity  generation and tariff requirements. It also fits well  with \nWAPDA\u2019s least-cost Generation Expansion Plan, in which it is listed, and is underpinned by a \nrobust contractual structure. Laraib\u2019s success can be attributed largely to the persistence and \nprofessional and technical capabilities of Laraib\u2019s initial owners and management team. Laraib\u2019s \nowners and managers are associated with several other business enterprises built over many \nyears  including,  for  example,  representing  Sumitomo  Corporation\u2019s  power,  energy,  and \ncommunications interests in Pakistan. Laraib\u2019s owners are also involved, via separate companies, \nin a captive hydropower generating plant  that generates 10 GWh per annum. It is the only private \nhydel plant in Pakistan, serving a steel furnace and other small-scale hydropower development \ninitiatives in AJ&K. \n \n23.  Laraib\u2019s  initial  owners\u2019  and  investors\u2019  intention  was  to  attract  additional  large-scale \ninvestors to the Project once it achieved a sufficient level of development. The original owners of \nLaraib have recently achieved this important objective with the introduction into the Project of \nRanhill, which will take a 51% stake in Laraib.  \n \n24.  Ranhill Berhad, which has been listed in the Main Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock \nExchange since 2001, was originally established in 1973 by the Australian consulting engineers \nRankine  and  Hill  to  provide  mechanical  and  electrical  engineering  design  services.  Ranhill \nbecame wholly Malaysian owned in 1981 and expanded its range of engineering services to the \noil and gas sector through a partnership with Flour Daniel of the USA. Its business objectives \nhave since expanded to include power, infrastructure, water, and oil and gas. Ranhill today \nprovides  full  engineering  and  construction  services,  from  initial  concept  design  to  detailed \nengineering,  construction,  and  commissioning,  and  its  activities  encompass  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contracts; project management and operations; and maintenance. \nRanhill\u2019s activities are international in scope and include work performed in Southeast Asia, the \nIndian subcontinent including Pakistan, the Middle East, and Africa. Ranhill\u2019s investment in Laraib \nis part of its recent strategy since 1999 of developing outright ownership of infrastructure and \nutility assets, domestically and internationally, as a way to stabilize cash flows over economic \ncycles. Ranhill Berhad is also Malaysia\u2019s first fully integrated private water company (from water \nsource to tap) under a 30 year concession serving 2.2 million customers in the state of Johor.  \n  \n25.  The management resources of Laraib will be supplemented by the resources of the \ndesignated operation and maintenance contractor, a subsidiary of Union Fenoza of Spain, which \nhas extensive hydropower assets and operating experience, and which will provide, subject to \nagreement on terms, support during the initial years of project operation. \n \n26.  The project construction administration will be established including an owners\u2019 engineer \nto provide strong overview and control by the owner.  \n \n \n \n ", "8   \nB.  Project Description \n \n27.  The Project involves construction and operation of a run-of-the-river, low-head, 79 MW \nhydel power-generating complex. The Project is located at the New Bong Escape, 7.5 km \ndownstream of the existing Mangla Dam, which was completed in 1967 on the Jhelum River in \nAJ&K. The project site is 120 km from Islamabad. The Project will be fed by water originating \nfrom the Mangla Reservoir, which is released through the Mangla powerhouse (1,000 MW) into \nthe Bong Canal. There is no new reservoir or other water storage envisaged for the Project. The \nproject site, scheme, and environmental aspects are illustrated in Appendix 3. \n \n28.  The  key  components  of  the  Project  include  the  headrace  channel,  power  intake, \npowerhouse complex, tailrace channel, substation, switchyard, road, bridge, subsidiary outfall \nstructure, and interconnection with 132 kV transmission line. The headrace channel is around \n500 meters (m) long and will connect the Bong Pond and the proposed powerhouse. The \nheadrace channel is concrete lined, with a capacity of 1,080 cubic meters per second (m3/sec) \nof water flow. The powerhouse complex will house four sets of bulb turbines and generators, \nand associated electrical and mechanical systems. The tailrace channel is 4,014 m long and will \nrelease water from the powerhouse to the Hari River, a channel of the Jhelum river. The \nswitchyard  will  provide  connectivity  with  the  existing  132  kV  system  through  an  in-out \narrangement on the 132 kV Mangla\u2013Kharian transmission line passing over the project site.  \n \n29.  Project  construction  will  take  approximately  36  (required  42  months),  including  civil \nworks  taking  approximately  24  months  and  electro-mechanical  works  taking  approximately \n36months. The delivery, installation, and commissioning of the first of four turbines will take \nplace  in  the  26th  month,  and  of  subsequent  turbines  after  that.  The  powerhouse  should \ncommence electricity production some 27 months after the start of construction with full capacity \nbeing  reached  at  the  end  of  the  36th  month.  The  Project\u2019s  technical  aspects,  including \nhydrology and construction arrangements, will be comprehensively reviewed by Mott McDonald \nof the United Kingdom, which has been retained as independent engineer to ADB and IDB. It is \nenvisaged  that  this  role  will  continue  through  construction  and  initial  operations.  Mott \nMacDonald has visited the project site, and its initial assessments are satisfactory. \n \nC.  Key Project Implementation Arrangements   \n \n30.  Sherman & Sterling and Kabraji & Talibuddin have been retained by ADB and IDB as \nlenders\u2019 external legal counsel to coordinate legal due diligence on project permitting and \nlicenses, implementing legislation, and project contracts and financing arrangements. The legal \ndue diligence process is under way. \n \n1.  Power Offtake \n31.  The power generated by the Project will be sold to NTDC under a long-term PPA during a \n25-year  concession  period.  The  PPA  contains  a  take-or-pay  undertaking  whereby  energy \nproduction not purchased by NTDC will be compensated through a minimum energy payment, \nbased on the possible energy production and historic hydrology. \n ", "  9\n32.  NTDC, which is more fully discussed in Appendix 2, was incorporated on 6 November \n1998 and commenced commercial operations on 1 March 1999. Ultimately, NTDC\u2019s financial \nstrength and operational capacity stems from being wholly owned by the Government. This \nGovernment\u2019s support of NTDC\u2019s critical role in the power sector is evidenced, in the case of the \nProject, by the Government\u2019s guarantee of NTDC\u2019s performance obligations under the PPA.  \n \n33.  Operationally, NTDC links power generation units and load centers around the country, \npurchasing power from public and private sector generators (noting that the process of transfer of \npurchase obligations for private power from WAPDA to NTDC is ongoing) and selling this to the \neight distribution companies through its network of some 32,000 km of transmission lines, 624 grid \nstations, and 47 consumer substations of varying capacities all over the country. This network \nmakes NTDC one of the largest contiguous grid systems in the world.  \n \n2.  Project Tariff, Project Award, and Government Approval  \n34.  The project concession was awarded to Laraib under the Government\u2019s Hydel Policy \n1995. This policy, like the thermal policy before it, lays down a framework and process for \nselecting and developing private hydel power projects. Laraib applied for and received a letter of \ninterest to develop the Project as a raw site and carry out a feasibility study. After completing the \nfeasibility study, Laraib was issued a letter of support on 18 May 1996, allowing it to further \ndevelop  the  Project,  negotiate  the  tariff  with  WAPDA,  and  proceed  to  financial  closing, \nconstruction, and commercial operations. Two years after promulgation of the Hydel Policy 1995, \nthe Government decided that all projects that had been issued letters of support would not be \nautomatically eligible for the Hydel Policy 1995 tariff but would have to negotiate directly with the \npower purchaser. This disrupted the development process and caused a delay in finalizing the \ntariff with NTDC (originally, WAPDA). The change in policy was a direct repercussion of the tariff \ndisputes with the thermal IPPs. The upside of this process, and of the finely negotiated tariff that \nresulted from it, are the creation of a \u201cwilling buyer\u2013willing seller\u201d agreement and the tariff security \nthat this brings. Further, the tariff has been approved by NEPRA, the regulator that oversees the \ntariff regime in Pakistan and seeks to balance the rights of consumers with the commercial \nimperatives of the generating companies. \n \n35.  The Government's selection criteria for awarding such concessions include, but are not \nlimited to, the following:  \n \n(i)  sponsors\u2019 financial strength, technical capability, and past experience;  \n(ii)   project parameters such as the requirements that projects must generate at least \n40% of their design capacity in the January\u2013June winter months of low water \nflow, plant factors must be 50% or above, and projects must be located on \nsmaller rivers or canals, as projects on main rivers require special permission; \nand  \n(iii)   the Hydel Policy 1995 tariff must be met, such that, for example, levelized and \nnominal tariffs are within prescribed ranges.   \n \n36.  To achieve a level playing field and economic efficiency, the Government indicated \ntarget tariffs for projects of different sizes. It was then made incumbent on the developer to \nframe its tariff profile to meet the target tariff guidelines provided. The ultimate tariff negotiated \nand agreed would have to take into account the plant factor, project cost, and any other project-\nspecific  features,  but  was  essentially  designed  to  reflect  cost  recovery  with  a  maximum \npermitted indicative equity internal rate of return. The Government ensured its goal of low-cost \ngeneration by capping tariffs and thus returns, leaving private sector developers to develop their \n ", "10  \nprojects to meet its needs. Thus, by controlling the tariff and indirectly capping project costs, the \nGovernment was able to achieve transparency and cost control, which is critical to its goal of \nlow-cost electricity.  \n \n37.  International experience shows that the tariff is competitive, while the project cost is also \nwell within accepted international norms for such projects based on bulb turbines, low heads, \nand a relatively large volume of water flow. The lenders\u2019 independent engineer has already \nprovided an initial validation, and this subject will be covered in detail in its due diligence report. \n \n38.  The Project is situated within an area of high demand near a generation-deficient load \ncenter. Based on load studies, forecasts, and information available for the power market, it is \nexpected that there will be high demand for the Project\u2019s output. The Project is designed to feed \ninto a transmission line at 132 kV and will mainly feed the nearby Gujranwala Electric Power \nCompany (GEPCO) load center, which is currently deficient in generation. As such, the Project \nwill not only meet GEPCO\u2019s load center needs but also reduce NTDC\u2019s 500 kV and 220 kV \npower flow imports that presently feed GEPCO, relieving the burden on NTDC\u2019s higher voltage \ntransmission system and reducing NTDC\u2019s transmission losses. In addition, the Project is a \nsource of reactive power to the 132 kV systems and thus improves its voltage profile and \nstability. Consequently, the Project is expected to rank high in dispatch merit among the peak \nload power plants in AJ&K and Pakistan generally, as is the case with the Mangla plant. NTDC\u2019s \nintent  in  this  regard  is  explicit,  as  NTDC  is  specifically  obligated  under  the  PPA  to  give \npreferential dispatch to the Project ahead of thermal plants. In addition, hydropower plants such \nas the Project are ideally suited for frequency control and peak demand operation. In any power \nsystem, peaking power is the most expensive, and using hydropower for peaking imputes the \nmaximum value to hydel capacity. Further benefits of hydel power include rapid response to \nsudden system requirements, and the low cost of generation. As water released by the Mangla \npowerhouse (1,000 MW) will be utilized by the Project in the same pattern and volume, the \nProject\u2019s generation will shadow that of the Mangla plant and will thus provide additional, and \nmuch needed, critical peaking power to the system. \n \n3.  Power Evacuation \n39.  The Project\u2019s electricity will be evacuated through the existing 132 kV Mangla-Kharian \ntransmission line, which passes over the Project site. Minimal new construction is required for \nconnection other than for the switchyard and cable ducts of approximately 500 meters to the \nexisting transmission line, and the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract \nincludes this cost. Through this line, the power will be transmitted to the AJ&K regional grid for \nsupply to NTDC and its customers. The interconnection and transmission facilities will be built \nby the Project and included under the EPC contract, thus minimizing connection risks. \n \n4.  Water Use and Hydrology \n40.  The Project\u2019s energy generation relies upon the flows through the Bong Canal, less the \nwater requirement of the Upper Jhelum Canal, which is drawn based on irrigation requirements. \nThe Bong Canal is in the Mangla powerhouse tailrace and fed from the Mangla Reservoir, which \nis in turn fed by the rivers Jhelum, Kanshi, and Punch together with flows of the Jhelum tributaries \nKunhar  and  Neelum.  The  catchment  of  the  Jhelum  River  above  Mangla  is  33,330  square \nkilometers of which 82% is higher than 1,220 m and 28% is higher than 3,050 m. The basin is \nbounded on the north by the Great Himalayas and contains the whole Vale of Kashmir. The \nMangla Reservoir was constructed in 1967 with a storage capacity of some 5.88 million acre feet \n(MAF), of which about 1.2 MAF has been lost through sedimentation in its first 37 years. \n \n ", "  11\n41.  The Project will rely on well-regulated and proven water releases from the existing \nMangla powerhouse (which currently has 1,000 MW of capacity). The Mangla Reservoir has an \naverage annual inflow of about 23 MAF. Of this, around 2.6 MAF has been passing through the \nspillway annually and 6.6 MAF has been the annual requirement of the Upper Jhelum Canal, \nthus leaving an average of about 13.6 MAF annually for the Project. The Project has been \ndesigned to utilize an average of 12.2 MAF per annum.  \n \n42.  The Project\u2019s hydrology risk has been extensively studied and is considered to be low.  \nReliable hydrological data is available from the Mangla Dam Organization records from 1922 to \ndate. Furthermore, a scheme is currently under implementation on the Mangla Dam itself, which \nshould significantly increase water flows to the Project and thus further reduce hydrological risk.  \nThe proposed Mangla Raise project (raising the storage of Mangla Reservoir from 4.7 MAF to \n7.6 MAF) was signed on 28 June 2004 and is due for completion in 2007 or 2008. This will \ncontribute an additional 15%\u201320% of energy generation to the Project, although this additional \ngeneration is not included in the base case or economic analysis.  \n \n43.  The Project will not alter the existing water regime of the area. This conclusion is \nsupported by the summary initial environmental evaluation, which is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n44.  A water use agreement (WUA) allowing Laraib exclusive right to use the waters of the \nBong Canal was signed between the company and GOAJK on 16 April 2004. The WUA, which \nis guaranteed by the Government of Pakistan, provides for the grant of exclusive rights to utilize \nthe water of the Bong Canal with water releases assured on the basis of historic hydrology. \nNTDC is responsible for paying a water charge directly to GOAJK. \n \n \n5.  Government Implementation Agreements and Guarantee \n45.  Simultaneously  with  the  PPA,  two  implementation  agreements  have  been  signed \nbetween Laraib and the Government of Pakistan and GOAJK respectively. The agreements \nallow Laraib to implement the Project and specify the incentives and concessions offered. \n \n46.  In addition to the implementation agreements, a Government of Pakistan guarantee \nprovides an overriding performance security from the Government in favor of Laraib, in addition \nto the other security provisions set forth in the PPA and the implementation agreements. \n \n6.  Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Contract  \n47.  The Project will be constructed under a lump-sum, fixed-price, date-certain turnkey EPC \ncontract.  The  non-EPC,  non-critical  parts  of  the  Project,  including  the  housing  colony, \nlandscaping, roads, etc., may be contracted out to various local contractors, package-wise on a \nturnkey basis, but under the responsibility of the EPC contractor. \n \n48.  The process of securing a fixed-price, lump-sum, turnkey EPC contract was competitive. \nLaraib initiated the process in September 2004 when nine firms from Pakistan, Malaysia, China, \nand Germany were asked to submit fixed-price bids using the Project's feasibility study as the \nbasis for their offer. This initial set of bids, while inconclusive, established a range of prices for \nthe EPC contract works. In view of its past track record, together with its appreciation of EPC \ncontracting, the decision was made to negotiate with Ranhill Engineers and Constructors as the \nEPC contractor for the Project. \n \n ", "12  \n49.  The lenders' independent engineer reviewed both the above tendering process and the \nfinal prices and has expressed an initial positive opinion on both matters. The Project's EPC \ncost compares favorably with similar projects elsewhere. Laraib was thus satisfied that the cost \nof both the EPC contract and the Project as a whole is indeed reasonable when compared to \nsimilar projects elsewhere in the world and the best price available in the market at the moment. \n \n7.  Operational Arrangements \n50.  Soluziona, a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Fenosa, the third largest electricity utility \nin  Spain,  is  expected  to  be  the  O&M  contractor.  Soluziona  has  significant  operational \nexperience,  as  it  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and  management  of  Union  Fenosa\u2019s \ngenerating assets amounting to some 9,782 MW, including 2,727 MW of hydel, as well as third-\nparty plants. Union Fenosa has annual turnover of \u20ac5.8 billion and total group assets of \u20ac15.2 \nbillion. Laraib\u2019s owners themselves have experience in small-scale hydel operations, and the \nmanagement team is expected to include one or more hydel experts. \n \n8.  Land Lease Arrangements \n51.  The project site was originally leased by WAPDA from AJ&K as part of the Mangla Dam \nproject in the 1960s. As per the terms of this original arrangement, WAPDA returned the site to \nAJ&K as land surplus to the needs of the Mangla Dam project. Laraib has now leased 21.4 \nhectares of this land from AJ&K, with the formal lease notification executed on 9 October 2003. \nThe required lease payment has been made and possession of the land taken by Laraib. The \nlease period is 25 years with an option for extension. \n \n9.  Insurance Arrangements \n52.  Laraib will take out insurance to cover essential risks for the supply and transportation of \nplant and machinery for erecting and commissioning and to cover all risks during construction \nand after commencement of commercial operations. The insurance package will be designed to \nmaximize cover for insurable risks. An insurance advisor to the lenders will be retained to review \nand implement insurance arrangements. \n \nD.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Environment  \n53.  The Project has been classified environmental category B considering the Project\u2019s \ndesign as a run-of-the-river scheme and its environmental and ecological setting. Environmental \nclearance for the Project was received from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of \nGOAJK  and  the  Government  of  Pakistan  EPA  in  20  August  1996  and  6  January  1997, \nrespectively. Clearance was later reconfirmed by GOAJK EPA in August 2004 for increasing the \nproject  capacity  from  45MW.  Notwithstanding  the  reconfirmation  of  the  environmental \nclearance, Laraib updated the original environmental and social assessment to reflect any new \ndevelopments that had taken place after the clearance and to assess any possible impacts due \nto the increase in project capacity. The updated environmental and social assessment was \nprepared in the form of an initial environmental examination document, and its summary is \npresented in Appendix 3. The examination confirmed that the findings and conclusions on the \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  Project  in  the  original  environmental  and  social \nsoundness assessment11 report remain valid.  \n                                                 \n11\n  The designated term for the environmental impact assessment process in Pakistan. \n ", "  13\n \n54.  During construction, the Project will create certain environmental disturbances, such as \nthe noise and dust invariably associated with construction. These environmental disturbances \nwill be temporary and can be effectively addressed through established sound engineering \ndesign and mitigation measures as well as sound environmental management practices in the \nconstruction process. These issues will be prescribed and included as part of the EPC contract. \nThe dredging of one channel of the Jhelum River and the embankment works will have no \nimpacts on the river flow regime and ecosystem, as the flood plain is broad and has several \nchannels during the dry season. The Project will utilize water currently discharged from the \nMangla hydropower plant into the Jhelum River. Therefore, it will not change the current flow \nregime of the river. Proper treatment of wastes from the construction and residential quarters \nand offices, the minor environmental management issue that has been raised, will be mitigated. \n \n2.  Social Safeguards \n55.  No indigenous people live in the area surrounding the Project, no inhabitants occupy the \nsite itself, and so no resettlement issues exist. The only minor social issue is the unauthorized use \nof about 6 hectares of land on small areas of the Project site by families from two adjacent \ncommunities for fodder cultivation and grazing. To resolve this issue, public consultations were \nheld in the two adjacent communities, and the few families concerned agreed to stop their \nunauthorized land use. Laraib has expressed its willingness to provide suitable compensation to \nthem (see Appendix 3). \n \n3.  Development Impact \n56.  The Project is designed primarily to promote economic growth through increasing the \nsupply of electricity at relatively low cost. The power generated by the Project will help the \ncountry to bridge a pending electricity shortfall, thus avoiding energy shedding and economic \ndisruption.  Sponsored  by  private  investors,  complemented  by  Malaysian  and  Spanish \nengineering and power companies, the Project will provide best practice in energy infrastructure \ndevelopment. As the first private hydel power investment in Pakistan, the Project will provide an \nimportant benchmark for future hydel projects that are planned. The Project was developed in \nthe context of the Hydel Policy 1995, which ensures competitive power, and it thus improves \nsector-wide efficiency. The Project is based on indigenous and renewable energy, which is \nessential for sustainable economic development and particularly well suited to Pakistan, and will \nsupport the development of the CDM market under the Kyoto Protocol, to which Pakistan is a \nsignatory. The Project will catalyze financing from local and/or international commercial banks, \nencouraging these institutions to develop their private infrastructure lending activities to support \nthe newly evolving private hydel sector and extend the maturities of their financing beyond those \ntypically available in the market at present. The Project will also be the first ADB cofinacing \nagreement integrating Islamic banking principles and conventional banking instruments. The \nProject will create employment opportunities for up to 500 workers at any one time during the \nconstruction period and some 30\u201350 workers during operations. Laraib will seek to maximize \nthe hiring of local people and is also committed to equal opportunities for women. A significant \nnumber of jobs for women are expected at Laraib as well as at the social facilities (a school and \nclinic) that will be constructed by Laraib for the benefit of the Project and the local community. \nThis employment creation is particularly important given that this is a relatively poor region of \nPakistan and that the Project will thus directly help to create conditions for economic growth and \npoverty alleviation. \n \n ", "14  \n4.  Development Effectiveness \n57.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  and  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment  are  formulating  guidelines  for  implementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for \nEvaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations, which were prepared by the Evaluation \nCooperation Group12 of the multilateral development banks. These standards cover the roles of \nthe independent evaluation department and the PSOD itself, the evaluation dimensions for \nprivate sector operations, the nature of annual reporting, and dissemination of reports and \nlessons. According to the standards, the three principal dimensions for private sector evaluation \nare development outcome (encompassing project performance, the project\u2019s contribution to \neconomic  sustainability,  and  its  contribution  to  private  sector  development),  investment \nprofitability of the project intervention to the institution itself (i.e., specific returns on the loan, \nguarantee, or equity investment), and operational effectiveness measured and assessed on an \noverall department level.  \n \n58.  The Project has been assessed and described from the perspectives of development \neffectiveness and project framework in terms of its specific performance, and the Project\u2019s \ncontribution to both economic sustainability and private sector development (please refer to \nAppendix  4).  The  Project  is  deemed  to  be developmentally  effective,  and  its performance \nmeasurable. A brief summary discussion follows on each of these parameters. \n \na.  Project Performance \n59.  The  Project  will  be  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  construction, \noperational, and financial objectives. Essentially, effectiveness will be measured against how \nsuccessfully the Project (i) attracted capital (both debt and equity), (ii) secured fixed construction \ncosts and contracting arrangements for on-time construction within budget and specifications, \n(iii) secured suitable operational arrangements to enable optimal production of electricity and \ndispatch to NTDC, and (iv) was profitable as measured both by debt repayment capacity and \ninvestor returns. \n   \nb.  Economic Sustainability \n60.  The Project will be assessed from an economic sustainability point of view on its ability \nto add needed generation capacity to the country\u2019s resources, in a least-cost manner and in an \nenvironmentally and socially acceptable way. In addition, the Project\u2019s outputs and contributions \nto the Government are considered, such as contributions to the economy via construction and \noperational expenditures and employment opportunities created. The Project\u2019s contribution to \nsystem efficiency (via its competitive tariff) and sector reform are considered. \n \nc.  Private Sector Development \n61.  The Project will be assessed and measured on how it contributes to private sector \ndevelopment. The focus of this assessment is on the Project\u2019s commercial and financial viability \nand its lasting demonstrative and catalytic effect on future private sector developments in the \nsector itself (with particular note of its demonstrative role as the first private hydel project in \nPakistan) and the economy as a whole. \n \n                                                 \n12\n  The  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  was  established  by  multilateral  development  banks  to  design  common \nevaluation standards for private sector operations. This work is ongoing, and some aspects of the evaluative \nframework may be subject to change according to best practices. \n ", "  15\n62.  The project was not specifically assessed from an investment profitability point of view, as \na profitability assessment is better gauged and measured against a portfolio of similar loans. \nSimilarly, the Project was not assessed and measured against overall operational effectiveness, \nas this is a department-wide consideration.  \n \n63.  The  EPC  cost,  which  is  the  major  portion  of  the  project  cost,  is  expected  to  be \ndenominated  largely  in  dollars.  It  is  intended,  subject  to  market  conditions  and  economic \nconstraints, that the funding be provided in a combination of dollars and Pakistani rupees. \n \nE.  Economic Evaluation \n \n64.  The economic analysis attempts to quantify the net benefits the Project generates for the \nPakistani economy in the context of the present and projected electricity demand and supply \nbalance.  The  Project\u2019s  capacity  output  is  considered  incremental  and  non-tradable.  The \nincremental benefit is calculated using the Project\u2019s quantity output. Output was based on 426 \nGWh\u2014ignoring an additional potential 95 GWh output based on increased and better regulated \nflows expected on completion of the Mangla Raise Project being undertaken by WAPDA\u2014and \nan average end-user tariff. For the purposes of the analysis, a consumer surplus was not \nconsidered, as the Project\u2019s benefits demonstrate a sufficiently robust economic result. The \nincremental project benefit, due to the non-tradable nature of electricity, was adjusted using a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.9. The incremental benefit was considered in light of economic \ncosts, namely capital expenditures, O&M costs, and transmission and distribution costs. No \nhydro costs or water charges were considered due to there being no opportunity cost of the \nwater used by the Project. Similarly, the Project is located on uninhabited scrubland, so the \nopportunity cost of the land used is considered nil. No resettlement issues or costs attach to the \nProject. \n \n65.  The resulting economic internal rate of return is strong and is an important conclusion \ngiven  that,  while  the  Project  itself  represents  a  negotiated  investment  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s Hydel Policy 1995, significant economic benefits will accrue to Pakistan as a \nresult of the Project. \n \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n \n66.  The  proposed  loan  of  up  to  $37.3  million  without  government  guarantee  from  the \nordinary capital resources of ADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  amount  will  be  determined  so  that  ADB\u2019s  total \nexposure to the Project will not exceed ADB PSOD\u2019s single-transaction limit of 25% of total \nproject cost. \n \nB.  Justification for Assistance \n \n67.  The Project merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons:  \n \n(i)  The  Project  will  help  Pakistan  meet  growing  demand  for  electricity,  which  is \nessential for economic growth, in a least-cost manner by generating renewable \nenergy with no detrimental environmental or social impacts.   \n ", "16  \n(ii)  The  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private \nparticipation in the power sector, and especially in hydropower generation, where \nPakistan is deemed to have a very strong competitive advantage. As well as the \naddition of generating capacity, the Project will help ameliorate the balance of the \ndeclining  hydro/thermal  generation  mix  in  Pakistan,  which  is  an  objective  of \nWAPDA and the Government. \n(iii)  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country and energy sector strategies, which \nemphasize  supporting  energy  infrastructure  development  with  private  sector \nparticipation  and  environmentally  clean  technology.  It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s \nthematic priorities of private sector development, sustainable economic growth, \nand environmental sustainability. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s public sector \noperations, which have assisted the Government\u2019s effort to restructure the power \nsector to attract more private sector investments, and ADB\u2019s emphasis on pro-poor \neconomic development in AJ&K. \n(iv)  Through the Project, ADB will be able to endorse best practices in infrastructure \ndevelopment.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  provide  a  benchmark  to  other \nhydropower generators and will contribute to the development and reform of the \npower sector.  \n(v)  ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will enable and support local and overseas \nequity investment in the Project and catalyze local and/or overseas sources of \ndebt  capital.  The  Project  also  promotes  combining  conventional  and  Sharia-\ncompliant debt facilities for infrastructure projects. \n(vi)  The Project will help to support Pakistan\u2019s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and \nthe development of the CDM markets, which is consistent with ADB\u2019s thematic \ninterests. \n \nVI.  INVESTMENT LIMITS \n68.  The proposed loan, which is PSOD\u2019s 39th in Pakistan, would, if approved by the Board, \nincrease PSOD total exposure13 to Pakistan from 2.05% to 4.57%, and increase infrastructure \nsector exposure from 51.37% to 52.62%. The proposed loan is within ADB\u2019s aggregate country, \nindustry, and single-project exposure limits for private-sector projects.14\n   \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n69.  A framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its equity investments, lending operations, and guarantee operations in the private sector is in \neffect  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  ADB.15  Consistent  with  the  agreement \nestablishing the Asian Development Bank, the Government of Pakistan will be requested to \nconfirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  Laraib.  No  funding  will  be \ndisbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will also obtain appropriate assurances \nfrom Laraib in the financing documents customary to transactions of this nature including those \nrelevant to related party transactions.   \n                                                 \n13\n Exposure refers to drawn and undrawn portions of PSOD committed loans, equity investments, and guarantees as \nof 31 March 2005, which is the latest data currently available. An investment is considered committed when there   \nare signed legal agreements.  \n14\n These exposure limits are set in the Operations Manual, Section D10/BP, paras. 15\u201322. \n15\n Letters dated 21 June 1983, 9 December 1985, and 17 July 2002 between ADB and the Ministry of Finance and       \nEconomic Affairs.  \n ", "  17\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n70.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $37,300,000 to Laraib Energy Limited \nfor the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 15 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \n  President \n \n \n \n31 October 2005 \n \n \n ", " 18  Appendix 1 \nPOWER SECTOR IN PAKISTAN \n \nA.  Sector Framework and Reform \n \n1.  Electricity represents 16.3% of the total final energy consumption in Pakistan. The power \nsector,  which  encompasses  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity,  is \ngoverned and regulated under the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) Act of \n1997. NEPRA, which was constituted as an independent entity, is exclusively empowered under \nthe act and related rules to regulate all facets of the power sector. NEPRA is thus empowered to \n(i) grant licenses for generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) approve tariffs, rates, and \ncharges across the sector; (iii) establish uniform industry performance via codes and standards; \nand (iv) enforce the above. NEPRA, although mandated as an independent entity, is governed \nby a chairman and four members, all of whom are appointed by the Government, with the \nmembers recommended by, and representing, provincial interests. \n \n2.  Power  sector  policies  and  related  legislative  frameworks  are  developed  and \nimplemented by the Government via the Ministry of Water and Power. The Government initiated \nthe process of power sector reforms and restructuring in the early 1990s on the advice of the \nWorld Bank. The power sector restructuring and reform process, developed in various stages \nand through different initiatives, is reflected today in various policies, such as the Power Policy \n1994, Hydel Policy 1995, Transmission Line Policy 1995, Power Policy 1998, and Power Policy \n2002. These were designed, to a large extent, to attract private sector participation in a newly \nrestructured power sector. In addition, the NEPRA Act was promulgated to provide the overall \nregulatory umbrella for the sector. Finally, the Government is today undertaking the unbundling \nof the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) into various independent \nentities. The broad objectives of all these policies have been to (i) bring efficiencies across the \nentire  sector  via  competitive  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  with  appropriate \nindependent regulatory oversight; (ii) rationalize prices and subsidies; and (iii) encourage private \ncapital formation and investment to meet growing electricity demand. \n \n3.  The power sector, as a result of the policies and reforms referenced above, has been, \nand continues to be, in transition and is today semi-privatized and semi-deregulated. The power \nsector has historically been characterized by very significant Government control through the \nWAPDA  and  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  (KESC)  monopolies  (which  function  as \nvertically integrated utilities encompassing generation, transmission, and distribution) and by \nboth significant inefficiency, with losses in excess of 25%, and inability to meet demand. This \ncharacterization, at least in terms of outright Government control, has changed over the last \ndecade,  and  Pakistan  today  enjoys  significant  private  sector-led  generation  through \nindependent  power  producers  (IPPs),  which  together  represent  in  excess  of  30%  of  total \ngeneration capacity\u2014and where KESC has recently been privatized. The evident success in \nattracting  private  sector  generators  was  not  without  issues,  and  most  IPPs  ended  up  in \nsometimes acrimonious contract disputes with the Government and WAPDA. These disputes \nwere largely driven by a significant capacity overhang in the mid-to-late 1990s (the exact \nopposite situation of today) and consequent tariff implications. Notwithstanding discord, these \ndisputes have ultimately been settled amicably with minimal adjustments to the contracts. In \nhindsight, the terms of the contracts, although renegotiated, were ultimately honored, which \nprovides a degree of comfort in the present investment environment. \n \n4.  Significant reforms are today well underway with the aim of breaking WAPDA\u2019s Power \nWing into multiple and discreet generation and distribution units, and by placing WAPDA\u2019s \ntransmission assets into a single corporatized entity, the National Transmission and Dispatch ", "  Appendix 1  19\nCompany Limited (NTDC). NTDC will assume the additional function of acting as the single-\nbuyer of wholesale generation from multiple companies in the market (but excluding KESC) for \nonward transmission and sale to multiple distribution entities, in addition to responsibilities as \nmarket and system operator as an interim step to a fully competitive electricity market. The \nsingle-buyer model now being implemented will ultimately evolve into a multiple-buyer and \nmultiple-seller regime where generators and distributors can contract directly. It is important to \nnote  that  existing  IPPs  and  those  already  approved  and  under  development  will  be \ngrandfathered  under  their  respective  enabling  legislative  schemes  and  thus  preserve  their \ncontractual frameworks, including tariff structures. Such is the case for the Project, which will \ncontinue  to  be  implemented  under  the  Hydel  Policy  1995  with  a  25-year  power  purchase \nagreement with NTDC and the benefit of a Government guarantee. \n \n5.

The National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) exists as a result of the \nGovernment\u2019s power sector reform initiatives, which continue to be implemented. NTDC lies at \nthe center of the power sector today with a distinct corporate identity. NTDC is one of 12 newly \ncorporatized entities that were previously part of the Pakistan Water and Power Development \nAuthority  (WAPDA).  In  addition  to  NTDC,  eight  distribution  companies  and  three  thermal \ngenerating  companies  have  been  established,  with  WAPDA  itself  retaining  hydroelectric \ngeneration assets. The Government\u2019s strategy is to corporatize these entities with the final \nobjective of privatizing the generators and the distributors. NTDC will, however, remain wholly \nowned by the Government given its critical central roles as the sole national transmission \nnetwork, dispatch coordinator, and market operator. \n \n2.  NTDC was incorporated on 6 November 1998 and commenced commercial operation on \n1 March 1999. It was organized to take over all the properties, rights, assets, obligations, and \nliabilities of the 220 kV and 500 kV grid station and transmission lines and network owned by \nWAPDA. NTDC was granted Transmission License No. TL/01/2002 on 31 December 2002 by \nthe  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA)  to  engage  in  the  exclusive \ntransmission business for a term of 30 years, pursuant to section 17 of the Regulation of \nGeneration, Transmission, and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997 (NEPRA Act 1997). This \n30-year  license  calls  for  NTDC  to  undertake  three  specific  functions:  (i)  the  transmission \noperations of the high voltage power network (220 kV and 500 kV voltage capacity), normally \nreferred to as the wire business; (ii) the dispatch of all power generation linked to the national \ngrid; and (iii) the single purchaser/seller of power between generators, including independent \npower producers (IPPs) and distributors, with the notable exception of the Karachi Electric \nSupply Corporation (KESC), which conducts its own purchase and distribution functions within \nits franchise area but is also able, as a distributor, to purchase from NTDC. Although the power \ntrading activities are major new responsibilities for NTDC, the company has to maintain and \nincrease  its  focus  on  the  wire  business  in  terms  of  design  and  planning,  as  well  as  the \nsubsequent expansions, with a view to meeting the requirements of a competitive power trading \nmarket. These considerations are similar in the case of its dispatch function. The focus of NTDC \nin terms of dispatch has changed from the integrated utility operations within WAPDA of the \npast to the single-buyer model of today, which will evolve into a competitive economic dispatch \nmodel in due course. \n \n3.  Distributors  will  place  their  demands  on  NTDC  through  their  power  acquisition  or \nexpansion  programs  by  indicating  additional  demand  for  load  growth  and  new  bulk  load \nadditions. Similarly, the generators will intimate their intention to offer generation capacity in the \nfuture. In the constantly changing equation of demand and supply (i.e., generation), NTDC is \nbeing licensed as a transporter of power from generation companies to distributors able to \nmaintain an optimal balance between generation and demand by ensuring adequate capacity, \nat  all  times,  under  all system  conditions.  NTDC\u2019s  function  is critical  as  neither  generation \ncompanies nor distribution companies may have sufficient overall information to plan the entire \ntransmission system. Moreover, all distributors will be required to inform NTDC about their load \nforecasts, along with the locations and amount of expected load growth, and other information \nregarding their transmission requirements. As a result, NTDC will be able to plan and develop \nan adequate, reliable, and cost-effective transmission system and, in addition, provide the most \ncost effective means of locating additional generation to meet expected demand. To ensure \nadequate generation capacity at all times, NTDC is required to publicly announce its generation \ncapacity expansion plan and preferred sites for generation additions, to assist policymakers in ", "  Appendix 2  25\n   \nproposing the most economic generation and potential investors in making decisions about their \ninvestment in generation. \n \n4.  Prior to the commencement of a fully competitive market, NTDC has been designated as \nthe procurer of power on behalf of ex-WAPDA distributors according to their demand. NTDC \nwill\u2014after the fully competitive market is implemented and where generators and distributors \nmay contract directly, as specified under sub-article (2) of the NEPRA Act 1997\u2014procure \nelectric power for balancing services only. However, an important feature is the preservation of \ncontracts previously entered into between the generators and WAPDA/NTDC, which are backed \nby the sovereign guarantee of the Government of Pakistan. This grandfathering of contracts \nalso  applies  to  the  New  Bong  Escape  Hydroelectric  Project  (the  Project),  which  is  being \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  previously  enacted  policies  and  so  benefits  from  a \nGovernment\u2019s guarantee of NTDC\u2019s obligations under its power purchase agreement. \n \n5.  Operationally, NTDC links power generation units and load centers around the country, \nthus creating one of the largest contiguous grid systems in the world. It is responsible for \npurchasing the power from hydroelectric stations located in the north and thermal units in the \npublic and private sectors, installed mostly in the central and southern regions of the country, \nand for selling power to the nine distribution companies. The large power transportation network \nis composed of transmission lines and grid stations of 500 kV and 220 kV voltage capacities. \nNTDC is also responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the transmission \nfacilities throughout the country except the area served by KESC (Karachi and the Lasbela \ndistrict of Balochistan Province). The company also constructs 132 kV and 66 kV grid stations \nand transmission lines for the distribution companies. NTDC currently operates and maintains \nnine 500 kV and twenty-four 220 kV grid stations along with 10,167 kilometers of associated \ntransmission  lines.    NTDC\u2019s  functions  and  capabilities  include  (i)  design  and  engineering \nservices for the construction of transmission lines and grid stations; (ii) comprehensive system \noperation and specialized technical assistance to power sector participants; and (iii) the proper \ndesign, application, and functioning of a protective relay system. \n \n6.  Although  NTDC  has  very  significant  assets  inherited  from  WAPDA  and  is  an \nindispensable part of the national power sector and system, NTDC\u2019s corporatization process is \nstill under development. In this light, NTDC derives the necessary financial strength to operate \nand meet its obligations from its full Government ownership and, in the case of the Project, full \nand explicit Government guarantees of its obligations. NTDC is accordingly regarded as a \nquasi-sovereign/sovereign entity with financial capacity equivalent to that of the Government of \nPakistan. \n \n7.

The  proposed  New  Bong  Escape  Hydropower  Project  (the  Project),  with  a  generation \ncapacity of 79 megawatts (MW), is to be constructed on a 21.3 hectare site on the left bank of \nthe Jhelum River 7.5 kilometers (km) downstream of Mangla Dam in Azad Jammu and Kashmir \n(AJ&K), about 120 km from Islamabad. The Project was initially conceived with a capacity of 45 \nMW  and  received  environmental  and  social  clearance  from  the  national  and  provincial \nenvironmental agencies on 20 August 1996 and 6 January 1997, respectively. The clearance for \nthe enhanced capacity was reconfirmed by the provincial environmental agency on 23 August \n2004  subject  to  the  condition  that  sewage  from  residential  and  office  premises  would  be \nsubjected to proper treatment.    \n \n2.  The Project is classified as category B. No  people reside on the Project site, and no \nindigenous people live in the surrounding area. Therefore, relocation and indigenous people are \nnot issues. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out by the project sponsor \nduring  October\u2013November  2004  to  update  and  reconfirm  the  previous  findings  on  the \nenvironmental and social soundness of the Project, and a summary IEE was prepared as a \nstandalone document for public disclosure. Only the main IEE findings are summarized and \npresented in this report and recommendation to the President. \n \nB.  Description of the Project  \n \n3.  The Project facilities will consist of inlet, headrace channel, power house, tailrace channel, \nswitchyard, and houses for about 50 operational personnel; public utilities, including a sewage \ntreatment  plant;  and  a bridge  crossing  the  headrace  channel.  Technical  features  of  major \nfacilities are summarized below. \n \nTable A3: Technical Features of Major Project Facilities \n \nProject Facility  Technical Features \nHeadrace channel  Capacity: 1,080 m3/sec, length: 500  m, bed width: 78 m, bed \nslope: 1:6,000, concrete lining \nRoad bridge  Ordinary reinforced concrete road bridge spanning the headrace \nchannel \nTailrace channel  Capacity: 1,392 m3/sec, length: 4,136  m, bed width: 91 to 152 m, \nbed slope: 1:4,000 \nTailrace embankment  Length: 4,663  m, height: 6 m, top width 122 m, side slope 1:1.75, \nstone pitching \nPowerhouse   Width: 66 m, length: 67 m, operating head 10\u201313 m, design flow: \n1,023\u20131,136 m3/sec \nNew Bong Escape  Length: 1,040 m, width: 61 m \nchannel embankment \nm = meter, m3/sec = cubic meters per second. \nSource: Laraib Energy Limited. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n4.  The Project is a run-of-the-river hydropower scheme. It will divert water currently discharged \nfrom the Mangla powerhouse through the New Bong Escape structure, into the new project \nheadrace channel to drive four sets of low-head bulb turbine generators before returning the \nwater into the river through the project tailrace channel. The electricity generated will be fed into \nthe  existing  132  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  passing  over  the  site.  The  Project  tailrace \nchannel will be constructed to develop additional head by excavating the Hari Channel, one of \nseveral channels of the Jhelum River, to further drop its water level and create an operating \nhead of about 10\u201313 meters (m) on the turbines. The spoil from excavation of the tailrace \nchannel  will  be  used  for  flood  protection  through  construction  of  an  embankment  running \nparallel to the tailrace channel. An embankment will also be constructed along the New Bong \nEscape channel to divert the flow to the main channel to  the Jhelum River.  \n \n5.  The Project will be constructed on a design-and-build basis. An engineering, procurement, \nand construction (EPC) contractor will be awarded a comprehensive contract covering detailed \ndesign,  civil  works  construction,  installation  of  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  and \nmachines, test run, and commissioning. Description of the Environment  \n \n1.  Natural Environment  \n \n6.  The Project site, owned by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) as part of \nthe  Mangla  Dam  project  in  the  1960s,  is  vacant  land  with  shrubs  and  few  trees  and  no \narchaeological sites, graveyards, or mosques. The project area is a part of the Jhelum Valley \nand is in an active seismic area. Consequently, the earthquake return period of 1,000 years will \nbe adopted in the design of the powerhouse and major project facilities.  \n \n7.  The Jhelum River is the principal water resource in the project area, with a mean annual \nflow of about 28.37 billion cubic meters. Its flow is perennial and characterized by a great \nfluctuation in its discharge, with large flows during wet monsoons. The Jhelum River drains into \nthe Mangla Dam Reservoir. The water in the reservoir is used to generate electricity in the \nMangla powerhouse, with a total generation capacity of 1,000 MW. The water from the Mangla \nDam powerhouse is discharged into a tailrace channel, a man-made canal named Bong Canal. \nPart of the flow of the Bong Canal is fed into the Upper Jhelum Canal to meet irrigation \nrequirements, and the remaining flow is discharged into the Jhelum River through a man-made \nstructure named the New Bong Escape.  \n \n8.  During low flows, the Jhelum River downstream of the Mangla Dam meanders in several \nchannels through a very broad floodplain that is several kilometers wide in some locations. The \nJhelum River floodplain adjacent to the project site is more than 1,800 m in width. One of the \nchannels of the Jhelum River adjacent to the project site, called the Hari Channel, will be used \nas tailrace channel. This channel represents only a very small portion of the entire floodplain.  \n \n9.  As the project area is not densely populated and has no major industries, ambient air quality \nand water quality in the Jhelum River are high.  \n \n10. The project area has no ecological or biologically sensitive areas, as it has been subjected \nto human interventions for decades. Because of the degraded habitat conditions, the project site \nand its surroundings do not support any flora or faunal of ecological or economic significance.   \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3 29\n2.  Socioeconomic Environment  \n \n11. There are 21 communities within a 5 km radius of the project site. Only two communities, \nLehri and Ferozabad, are adjacent to the project site  and could be impacted by it. Some \nfamilies in these two villages use parts of the project site, without authorization from WAPDA, \nfor fodder cultivation and animal grazing. The Project will need to discontinue their use of the \nproject site. \n \n12. Lehri  village  has  about  150  households,  of  which  around  a  dozen  are  involved  in \nunauthorized use of parts of the project site. An overwhelming majority of the households are \nfinancially supported by relatives living in foreign countries, especially the United Kingdom. \nLocal trade and government and private employment is their secondary source of income. \nAgriculture and livestock are fringe economic activities, practiced at a level that is even less \nthan subsistence.   \n \n13. Ferozabad village has only about 12 houses occupied by one extended local family and \nsome small families that have come to the area after being displaced by conflict in their native \nnortheastern AJ&K. The primary source of livelihood for these families is employment in the \ngovernment and private sectors. Agriculture is a secondary economic activity. Young men from \na couple of families work abroad and remit money.   \n \n14. The social infrastructure and public amenities in the two villages are poor, as evidenced by \nunpaved roads and the absence of schools or clinics. The project proponent intends to assist in \nimproving social infrastructure and public amenities in these two villages.  \n \nC.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Impacts during Construction \n \n15. The construction of project facilities will inevitably create environmental disturbances and \nimpacts. But these will be transient and have no adverse ecological consequences, as the \nproject site is small and has no flora or fauna species of ecological importance. Mitigation \nmeasures including physical measures and good environmental management practices will be \nincluded  in  the  EPC  contract  to  ensure  that  the  design  and  construction  minimize  such \nenvironmental  problems  as  disposal  of  excavated  materials,  soil  erosion  and  degradation, \nfugitive dust, noise, safety and public health hazards, waste disposal, water turbidity in the \nJhelum River during the excavation of the Hari Channel, and blocked access to houses and \ncommunal facilities. \n \n16. In addition, the project sponsors are willing to pay compensation to those families that have \nto discontinue their unauthorized use of land in the project site. \n \n17. The Project will not induce population influx as the area experiences a general trend of out-\nmigration to larger towns and cities. During the detailed design, the project sponsors will consult \nwith the local administration for advanced planning to ensure minimum adverse impacts from \nany population influx. \n \n18. Although the Project will not have significant adverse social impacts, the project sponsors \nintend to help build social facilities in collaboration with the local agencies concerned.  \n \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \n \n2.  Impacts During Operation \n \n19. The Project will have no adverse environmental and social impacts during the operation \nphase, as it will not affect water availability in the Upper Jhelum Canal, and will not reduce the \nflows in the Jhelum River downstream of the New and Old Bong Escapes. However, after \nproject  completion,  the  New  Bong  Escape  channel  will  receive  water  only  in  case  of  the \nshutdown  of  the  project  powerhouse.  This  1,200  m  man-made  channel  has  no  ecological \nsignificance, and is not used by the local communities. Therefore, its drying up will not have any \nsignificant environmental or social impacts.  \n \n20. To ensure harmony of the Project with the environment, the project sponsor will implement \nsound  environmental  management  practices  to  effectively  handle  the  basic  environmental \nissues, including \n(i)  waste  management  of  residential  complex  and  offices,  particularly  sewage \ntreatment  to  the  required  standard  and  reuse  of  the  treated  effluents  for \ngardening;   \n(ii)  waste management of warehouse, workshops, and motor pools; \n(iii)  landscaping and plantation; \n(iv)  environmentally responsible conduct of personnel, who will be expected to refrain \nfrom such activities as hunting and tree cutting; and  \n(v)  noise and other public nuisance abatement. \n \n21. The above practices and conducts will be institutionalized in the environmental management \nsystem of the company. Appropriate undertakings and associated reporting requirement will be \nset out in the loan documentation.  \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan  \n \n1.  Environmental Management Plan  \n \n22. A project environmental management plan (EMP) was formulated, and it clearly defines (i) \norganizational structure, (ii) the roles and responsibilities of the various entities concerned, (iii) \nan  impact  mitigation  plan,  (iv)  an  environmental  monitoring  plan,  (v)  communication  and \ndocumentation,  and  (vi)  environmental  training.  The  EMP  was  prepared  for  both  the \nconstruction phase and the operational phase.  \n \n23. As the mitigation measures are part of the construction, their costs are included in the \ncontract cost and represent only a very small part of the project cost. The cost of sewage \ntreatment facilities for 50 operating personnel is also low compared to the cost of houses. The \nproject  sponsor  has  budgeted  about  PRs7.4  million  to  meet  the  cost  of  environmental \nmanagement personnel and administrative expenses over the construction period. \n \n24. The  project  sponsors  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  compliance  with  the \nenvironmental  and  social  management  requirements  of  the  provincial  government  and  the \nlenders.  The  EPC  contractor  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the  environmental \nperformance of all the subcontractors, ensuring that the subcontractors effectively implement all \nenvironmental management measures stipulated in the EMP and in the contracts. The project \nmanager, representing the project sponsors, will discharge the project company\u2019s environmental \nand social responsibility as part of project implementation management. The project proponent \nwill appoint an environmental and social inspector to assist the project manager and provide ", "Appendix 3 31\npolicy support on all environmental and social matters. The project proponent will coordinate \nwith relevant government departments and other stakeholders through its environmental and \nsocial inspector.  \n \n25. The EPC contractor will appoint an environmental and social supervisor to assist its project \nmanager in overseeing and monitoring the environmental performance of all the subcontractors. \nEach  subcontractor  will  appoint  an  environmental  and  social  officer  to  assist  its  resident \nengineer in implementing EMP aspects specific to its contract.  \n \n26. The mitigation plan for the construction phase is prepared and presented in the IEE. It \ncontains \n(i)  a comprehensive listing of mitigation measures (actions), \n(ii)  the person(s) responsible for ensuring the full implementation of the action, \n(iii)  the persons responsible for monitoring the action, and \n(iv)  a timescale for the implementation of the action to ensure that the objectives of \nmitigation are fully met. \n \n27. The identified mitigation measures will be translated into environmental requirements and \nspecifications for the detailed design and construction, with legally binding effect.  \n \n28. Environmental and social management tasks during the operational phase will be minimal \nand  become  routine  activities  as  part  of  the  overall  management  of  the  powerhouse.  \nManagement of wastes from residential quarters and offices will be the only main task.   \n \n2.  Monitoring Plan \n \n29. During the construction phase, the environmental performance of all subcontractors will be \nclosely  monitored  by  the  EPC  contractor  under  the  oversight  of  the  project  sponsor.  The \nmonitoring  will  cover  both  compliance  monitoring  and  effects  monitoring  in  line  with  the \nrequirements in the mitigation plan focusing on soil erosion, water quality, air quality, noise, and \nsocioeconomic aspects. A detailed monitoring plan will be developed during the detailed design \nphase of the Project, when specific information on field activities will be known. The monitoring \nschedule will be linked to the construction schedule.  \n \n30. An effective mechanism for storing and communicating environmental information will be \nestablished.  The  data  and  information  will  be  systematically  filed  and  stored  in  a  central \nlocation. Periodic meetings of all parties concerned will review the implementation of the EMP \nand monitoring results and resolve any identified problems. The EPC contractor will produce \nperiodic monitoring and evaluation reports. At the end of the construction phase, the EPC \ncontractor  will  prepare  a  final  monitoring  and  evaluation  report  to  be  a  part  of  a  Project \ncompletion report.  \n \n31. In addition, the EPC contractor will establish at the Project site a social complaint register to \ndocument all complaints received from local communities. The register will also record the \nmeasures taken to mitigate these concerns. All community complaints received will be sent to \nthe  project  proponent\u2019s  environmental  and  social  inspector  and  project  manager  for  their \ninformation and further action.  \n \n32. The EPC contractor will provide training to the project sponsor staff, the subcontractors, and \nother staff engaged for the Project. Training will cover the requirements of the IEE and EMP, \nwith special emphasis on sensitizing project staff to the environmental and social aspects of the ", "32  Appendix 3 \nProject. A training program will be prepared before the commencement of the Project during the \ndetailed design phase.   \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Disclosure  \n \n33. A consultation was held on 30 October 2004 with representatives of government agencies \nconcerned including WAPDA, the Irrigation Department of the government of Punjab, and the \nprovincial government\u2019s Revenue Department. All the representatives expressed their support \nfor the Project and willingness to cooperate.  \n \n34. A public consultation was held in Ferozabad on 1 November 2004. The public consultation \nteam visited seven houses that have been using the project site.  In each house visit, the public \nconsultation team explained the project layout, scope, and requirements as well as the impacts, \nparticularly on the unauthorized grazing and occasional cultivation on the project site practiced \nby some families. Their reactions to the various aspects of the Project were sought in a semi-\nstructured discussion. The villagers showed no concerns about environmental disturbances and \ninconveniences  that  the  Project  may  cause  during  construction,  since  they  had  similar \nexperiences with much larger projects in the past. The affected households expressed their \nwillingness  to  discontinue  their  unauthorized  use  of  the  project  site  but  expect  some \ncompensation.  \n \n35. In Lehri, a group consultation was held on 2 November 2004 involving about 16  household \nrepresentatives that have been using the project site. The results were similar to those of \nFerrozabad. \n \n36. The outcomes of the consultations led to a conclusion that the Project would have no \nsignificant social impacts. The small extent of unauthorized cultivation and grazing does not \nsignificantly contribute to the income of the residents of Lehri and Ferozabad villages. The \ngrazing activity can be conveniently shifted to the adjacent areas.   \n \nF.  Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations \n \n37. The IEE findings confirm that the Project, being a run-of-the-river hydropower project, is \nunlikely  to  cause  any  significant,  lasting  environmental  or  social  impacts.  Environmental \ndisturbances  normally  associated  with  construction  activities  will  be  minimized  through \nimplementation of the EMP and close monitoring of its implementation. Sound environmental \nmanagement practices and effective mitigation measures will be prescribed as part of the EPC \ncontract for detailed design and construction. \n \n38. It is concluded that the IEE is adequate to justify environmental and social clearance of the \nProject. It is recommended that the IEE is considered adequate for environmental and social \nassessment of the Project. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 4        3  3\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n1.
