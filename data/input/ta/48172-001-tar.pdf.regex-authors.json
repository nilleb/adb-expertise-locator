INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Indonesia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to facilitate the delivery of knowledge \nservices under the government and ADB Knowledge Initiative.1 This TA is in line with the \ngovernment\u2019s priorities for improving knowledge sharing and knowledge-to-policy capability in \nIndonesia.2 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for \nIndonesia.3 The scope of the TA was discussed in a series of meetings throughout 2014 that \nconcluded on 27 November. ADB and the government reached an understanding on TA impact, \noutcome, outputs, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and outline \nterms  of  reference  for  consultants.4 Government  concurrence  was  obtained  through  the \nconfirmation by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and National Development Planning Agency \n(BAPPENAS)  of  an  aide-m\u00e9moire  dated  2  December  2014.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nIndonesia  aims  to  become  an  upper-middle-income  country  by  2025  and  has  the  largest \npopulation  and  largest  economy  in  Southeast  Asia.  Developments  such  as  changes  in \ncommodity prices, foreign exchange fluctuations, and anticipated changes in labor mobility \nwhen the ASEAN economic community comes in to force require effective and timely responses \nfrom the government. Increased natural disasters and changing weather patterns challenge \nIndonesia\u2019s capacity to respond to natural disasters and its goal of achieving food security. \nRecognizing these immediate demands, the government has identified the need to diversify the \neconomy and strengthen its economic and environmental resilience. Key medium-term priorities \ninclude generating sufficient economic growth to avoid the middle-income trap, maximizing the \nbenefits  of  the  youth  dividend,  addressing  the  country\u2019s  growing  inequality,  strengthening \ncompetitiveness, and improving productivity. To respond effectively, the government recognizes \nthe  importance  of  strengthening  its  knowledge-based  policy  development.  Moreover,  to \ncompete regionally and globally, Indonesia will have to develop knowledge-based solutions to \nexisting  challenges  and  emerging  opportunities.  Exploiting  its  comparative  advantages  will \nrequire further research and analyses to identify innovations unique to Indonesia\u2019s natural and \nhuman assets.  \n2.  To  strengthen  Indonesia\u2019s  knowledge-based  development,  a  range  of  knowledge \nservices and approaches will be enhanced. Domestic centers of excellence need to be nurtured, \nand access to and twinning with international centers of excellence is also anticipated. Further \nstrengthening the knowledge\u2013policy nexus is also essential. In the short term, the government \nneeds immediate access to domestic and international knowledge services to inform its policies. \nIssues that  result  in  structural  change  will  require  detailed  analysis  and  consideration.  An \nexample might be how to generate the foreign direct investment necessary to diversify the \nenergy  mix.  Ad  hoc  advisory  services  will  support  policy  that,  by  its  nature,  requires  an \nimmediate response. Such an example would be the macroeconomic policy responses to an \nexogenous shock. These ad hoc advisory services are referred to by the government as \u201cjust-in-\ntime knowledge\u201d, as they cannot be planned and scheduled. \n                                                \n1   Knowledge services encompass knowledge products such as working papers, policy notes, and publications, and \nknowledge services such as seminars, conferences, workshops, and policy discussions. \n2   Knowledge-to-policy is a growing body of public policy literature aimed at processes and systems that strengthen \nthe linkages between research and policy development. \n3  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 November 2014.  \n ", "2  \n \n3.  Knowledge transfer. Sharing indigenous knowledge strengthens the development of \nappropriate  local  solutions.  The  government  takes  seriously  its  obligations  to  share  its \nknowledge with its neighbors and has invested heavily in south\u2013south and triangular knowledge \ncooperation.5 Equally, knowledge needs to be shared in a form that is relevant to the political \neconomy. Matters such as the learning modalities and approaches to knowledge transfer that \nare most effective in the country need to be incorporated into knowledge service design. Using \nappropriate modes for the delivery of ideas or the language for transferring knowledge all \ninfluence the effectiveness of turning knowledge into effective policy. \n \n4.  The government has requested support in areas including macroeconomic analysis and \npolicy advice, technical expertise in infrastructure development, education, energy security, food \nsecurity,  water  security,  public  sector  management,  regional  integration,  private  sector \ndevelopment, governance and project implementation. As importantly, new areas of support for \nknowledge  services  will  emerge  as  Indonesia  continues  to  implement  its  next  5-year \ndevelopment plan. The government seeks partners who can be responsive to these emerging \nknowledge sharing and analytical needs.  \n \n5.  In recognition of these challenges, the government and ADB have developed a draft \ncountry  knowledge  strategy,  2013\u20132015.6 The  draft  strategy\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i)  provide \ndemand-driven,  responsive,  and  timely  knowledge  support;  (ii)  maximize  the  operational \nbenefits of knowledge; (iii) coordinate knowledge support with other development partners and \neffectively mobilize cofinancing; (iv) collaborate closely with non-state knowledge users; and \n(v) enhance  in-country  knowledge  dissemination.  Planned  ADB  support  under  the  draft \nknowledge  strategy  includes  (i)  planned  knowledge  services  delivered  through  various \nresources as appropriate; (ii) business process and system development to capture, store, and \ndisseminate  government  knowledge;  and  (iii)  just-in-time  knowledge  services  primarily \nsupported through this TA. To facilitate responsive and timely knowledge support, the ADB\u2013\nIndonesia draft Knowledge Partnership Statement of Intent has also been developed.7 The \nstatement responds to the need for just-in-time knowledge and longer-term studies on structural \nchange.8 Moreover, the drafts reflect ADB\u2019s Finance++9 approach to its client relationships, \nwhich is reflected in ADB\u2019s current strategies, policies, and action plans.  \n \n6.  The proposed TA is intended to supplement the resources available to the government \nfor supporting just-in-time knowledge requests and where prioritized by government but not \nfunded through alternative sources or longer-term studies.10 \n \n                                                \n5  South-south knowledge transfer is term used to describe knowledge cooperation between two developing \ncountries. Triangular cooperation is a term used to describe south-south cooperation with a development partner \nbeing a third party. \n6   ADB. Forthcoming.

They are expected to be short term in nature but may lead to longer-term planned analysis. \n9   Finance++ is a term used by ADB to refer to its approach of financing development, leveraging additional \ndevelopment financing, and providing knowledge solutions and innovation. \n10  Through the annual planning of knowledge services and through the knowledge database managed by ADB\u2019s \nResearch and Sustainable Development Department, existing support to a knowledge request will be identified. At \nthe government level, collaboration with development partners and local think tanks will be necessary to minimize \nduplication of work. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be improved knowledge-based policy dialogue. The outcome will be \nstrengthened  knowledge  management  and  sharing  in  Indonesia.  Knowledge-based  policy \ndialogue stemming from ADB support will be evident in the policies. The effectiveness of this TA \nwill be evident if there is an increase in demand. This will be tracked and reported at the annual \ndiscussions of knowledge services. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  To achieve the TA outcome the following outputs will be delivered: (i) delivery of the \nannual ADB\u2013Government of Indonesia knowledge plan and its implementation; (ii) providing \nresponses to just-in-time knowledge requests through ADB resource persons and consultants \nas  needed  based  on  requests  from  the  MOF  and  BAPPENAS;  and  (iii)  TA  products \ndisseminated through the production of targeted publications and holding of seminars and \nworkshops on key policy and sector issues. Key activities supporting these outputs include \n(i) conducting an annual discussion among ADB, ADB Institute, and key government ministries \nand  state-owned  enterprises  to  develop  the  annual  knowledge  plan;  (ii)  establishing  a \nmechanism with government for it to prioritize just-in-time knowledge requests; (iii) supporting \npolicy dialogue on sector and thematic issues; (iv) putting in place panel contracts for editing, \ntranslation, and publication; (v) establishing commercial arrangements for hosting knowledge \nevents; and (vi) monitoring and managing planned and ad hoc requests, including knowledge \nservices. \n \n9.  Risk management within the TA will be important to ensure the anticipated development \noutcome. The following are the most important risks in the TA: (i) inadequate country resources \nare  directed  to  knowledge  management,  (ii)  key  ministries  do  not  respond  to  government \nrequests to plan analytical requirements, (iii) requests for knowledge services are made without \nadequate time to respond, and (iv) requests for knowledge services are not sufficiently detailed \nto provide a specific and valued response. In managing these risks (i) ADB will need to work \nclosely with the implementing agencies to ensure sufficient resources are provided, (ii) ADB \nsector specialist policy dialogue with key ministries should be used to facilitate the identification \nof  their  analytical  requirements,  (iii)  a  clear  planning  schedule  should  be  developed  and \ncommunicated  effectively,  (iv)  quality  products  should  be  delivered  in  a  timely  manner  to \ngenerate  further  demand,  and  (v)  there  should  be  collaboration  with  BAPPENAS  and  the \nKnowledge Sharing Initiative (financed by the Government of Australia) to strengthen ministries\u2019 \ncapacity to prepare requests for knowledge services. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $732,000, of which $725,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart contributions in the form of counterpart staff, office space, office materials, \nand other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n   \n ", "4  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented from January 2015 to December 2017. BAPPENAS will be \nthe executing agency, while BAPPENAS and the MOF will be the implementing agencies. \n \n12.  To facilitate knowledge services being demand driven and to leverage the expertise of \nADB, an annual discussion of the government\u2019s requirements for knowledge services will be \nconducted through the country operations business planning process. Knowledge departments \nof ADB, the ADB Institute, as well as thematic groups and communities of practice will identify \nall  knowledge  services  planned  for  Indonesia  in  the  following  year.  This  will  include  all \nknowledge services for which the government might be engaged or interested in, including \nthose of a regional nature. Once compiled, ADB will discuss with the government its identified \nneeds and seek approval for\u2014or adjust in light of the government\u2019s requests and priorities\u2014the \nplanned list of ADB knowledge services.  \n \n13.  Ad hoc or just-in-time knowledge services will also be supported based on requests from \neither BAPPENAS or the MOF. These will include sector and thematic issues, short policy \nnotes, seminars, and the engagement of eminent persons. Draft guidelines for the identification \nand management of just-in-time knowledge services have been developed and include the \nfollowing:  (i)  the  request  is  a  priority  with  respect  to  implementing  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment plan; (ii) the level of the service required, such as short consultancy, seminar of an \neminent speaker, or a short paper; and (iii) checking to see if the service or knowledge is \navailable within the government or ADB. Initial screening by the implementing agencies will then \nbe  provided  to  ADB for further screening  to  identify  if  ADB  resources  with the  necessary \nexpertise are available before considering contracting for the service. ADB will identify possible \nADB resource persons where applicable with the support of the Knowledge Sharing Service \nCenter and through direct engagement with the communities of practice and thematic groups.  \n14.  Requests  on  macroeconomic  matters  will  be  received  through  the  MOF  with \ngovernment-wide  requests  for  knowledge  services  being  received  through  BAPPENAS. \nFinancing, endorsing, and delivering against these requests will be done jointly by government \nand ADB. Where high-priority requests of the government do not have existing financing, the \nimplementing and executing agencies will consider the request for financing under this TA. \n \n15.  In supporting just-in-time knowledge services, the TA will maximize the use of ADB \nexpertise wherever possible. The TA will therefore finance ADB personnel travel as resource \npersons. The TA will finance the costs of conferences, workshops, seminars, and, if necessary, \nleased equipment, in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time) and in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time). Where applicable, ADB will utilize the services of the existing, \ncompetitively tendered United Nations contracts for the provision of preparing and managing \nconferences and seminars. Where the implementing agency is managing the event, financing \nwill be undertaken through the advance payment facility. Where a consultant is managing the \nevent, the requirements will be incorporated into the terms of reference and financed as an \nadvance through the consultant\u2019s contract. This will be determined in consultation with the \nexecuting agency on a case-by-case basis. \n \n16.  The TA will finance an estimated 12 person-months of international consulting services \nand 15 person-months of national consulting services. Consultants will be engaged through a \nfirm using the quality and cost\u2013based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 biodata \ntechnical proposal, or individually, depending on the best approach for each terms of reference, \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \n ", "  5\nto time). To reduce administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for \nmoney, consulting services under the TA will be engaged under an output\u2013based (lump\u2013sum) \ncontract wherever possible. The TA will be implemented in accordance with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  Specific terms of reference for each knowledge service will be developed and endorsed \nby the implementing agency and ADB. Outline terms of reference for the consulting positions \nare in Appendix 3 as well as sample terms of reference (Supplementary Appendix).  \n \n18.  The executing agency will prepare periodic performance reports to monitor the design \nand monitoring framework indicators, including the quality of knowledge services. The reports \nwill be presented during the annual country programming preparation as an input to the annual \nknowledge planning discussions. Each separate knowledge service terms of reference will also \ninclude a short description of its dissemination plan. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $725,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for Strengthening Knowledge Sharing in Indonesia, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved knowledge- Policy advice of knowledge  Reflected in laws,  Requests for services \nbased policy dialogue  services are identified in  regulations, standard  are closely aligned with \n  policy documents  operating procedures,  key policy actions. \n(Baseline 2014: 0)  decrees, and speeches   \n(Target 2016: 10)    Risk \n  National policy  Government is unable \nmonitoring mechanisms  to pass key reforms \n  through the House of \nRPJMN implementation  Representatives. \nreports \n \nStrategic policy \nstatements \n \nNational budget \nstatements \nOutcome       Assumptions \n       \nStrengthened  Clients report satisfaction  Feedback at the annual  Political stability is \nknowledge  with policy advice through  knowledge planning  maintained. \nmanagement and  TA that it has been, or is  consultations   \nsharing in Indonesia  planned to be, used in    Adequate country \n  developing policies or  Annual knowledge  resources directed to \nprograms, or implementing  planning consultations  knowledge \ninstitutional reform.     management. \n(Target 2016: Rating of >   \n3.7 [ on a scale of 1.0\u2013 Risk \n5.0])  Key ministries do not \n  respond to government \nIncrease in requests for  requests to plan \nknowledge services  analytical requirements \n(Baseline 2014: 0)  of ADB. \n(Target 2016: 100% on \n2015 requests) \n \nOutputs  By 2016:    Assumption \n1.
