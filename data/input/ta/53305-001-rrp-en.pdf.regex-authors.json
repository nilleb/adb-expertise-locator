THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Solomon Islands for the Domestic Resource Mobilization Project. The report also describes the \nproposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia and a grant to \nbe provided by the Government of New Zealand for the Domestic Resource Mobilization Project, \nand if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the administration of the grants. \n \n2.  The proposed project will support the Government of Solomon Islands to improve tax \nadministration. The development outcome will be improved domestic resource mobilization. This \noutcome will be achieved through (i) more efficient tax administration that provides better services \nto taxpayers; and (ii) increased capacity of the Inland Revenue Division (IRD) to manage the \ntransition to a more efficient, fairer, and transparent tax framework. The project will assist in \nrestructuring the IRD to (i) move to a functional structure and train staff in their new roles and \nprocesses, (ii) finance the acquisition of a new tax administration information system (TAIS) and \ntrain staff in its use, and (iii) deliver a public outreach program to increase taxpayer compliance.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development context. Solomon Islands is the third largest of the developing member \ncountries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the Pacific, with a population of about 721,000. \nADB recognizes Solomon Islands as a small island developing state and a fragile and conflict-\naffected situation.1 As a small open economy with a narrow economic base, the country is \ndependent  on  exports,  which  represented  42.0%  of  2019  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). \nRound logs accounted for 71.6% of exports and 22.0% of government revenues, and directly or \nindirectly supported nearly half of the workforce.2 Despite these constraints, Solomon Islands had \nsteady economic growth following the widespread civil conflict that lasted from 1998 to 2003. \nHowever, economic growth on a per capita basis has not been as robust because of the fast-\nincreasing population (more than 2% per year since 2004); the GDP per capita of $1,751, when \nadjusted for inflation, remains lower today than it was before the conflict. While poverty has \ndeclined, Solomon Islands has the second-lowest gross national income per capita among Pacific \ndeveloping member countries ($2,020 in 2018). The United Nations classifies it as a least-\ndeveloped country.3 Under the National Development Strategy, 2016\u20132035, the government aims \nto improve social and economic livelihoods through inclusive economic growth.4 To achieve this \ngoal, the government needs more sustainable revenues from domestic sources. \n \n4.  COVID-19  exposed fragilities.  The  coronavirus  disease (COVID-19) pandemic has \nexposed fragilities in the Solomon Islands economy. ADB estimated an economic contraction of \n4.5% of GDP for 2020.5 The government recognizes that new sources of growth need to be \nidentified to broaden the productive base of the economy and support the economy as it recovers \nfrom the economic contraction caused by the pandemic. A prerequisite is a tax system that (i) is \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n \n ", "2 \nefficient, simple, inexpensive to administer; (ii) discourages unproductive tax avoidance and \nevasion activities; and (iii) actively supports growth. A broad-based tax system that encourages \nproductive investments is particularly important in the post-COVID-19 era as the government \nseeks higher levels of investment to support economic growth. Solomon Islands performed well \nwith a tax-to-GDP ratio of 30.4% in 2018, which is at the higher end of countries across Asia and \nthe Pacific, however, tax revenues decreased by 7.8% in 2020 compared to 2019 because of the \ncontraction caused by COVID-19.6 This highlights the need for tax policy and administration \nreform to enhance domestic resource mobilization in an economically efficient manner. \n \n5.  Complex and unwieldy tax framework. There are multiple discrete indirect taxes: a \ngoods tax, excises, and customs duty levied on almost all imported goods, and services tax and \nstamp duty are applied selectively on internal transactions. Each has separate legislation; multiple \ntax rates; various generic and specific exemptions; different points of assessment; and different \nrules for the filing of returns, the timing of payments, offenses, and penalties. In addition to these \nindirect taxes, there are direct taxes on corporate, individual, and income withholding, each with \ndifferent rules, frequencies of payment, and penalty regimes. Finally, the tax framework fosters \nunproductive behavior, including competition rounds for a fixed pool of discretionary exemptions. \n \n6.  Government\u2019s tax reforms. In late 2017, the government initiated a comprehensive \nreview of its tax framework to simplify tax arrangements and broaden the tax base. The purpose \nof the review was to look at ways to raise revenue in an economically efficient manner, stimulate \nprivate sector growth, attract foreign investors, reduce the compliance costs on taxpayers, and \nlower tax administration costs. The government\u2019s tax reform program will result in new legislation \nthat is expected to be enacted progressively at intervals from the end of 2021 until mid-2023, \ncommencing with the Tax Administration Act that will standardize and simplify administrative \nprocedures and penalties for the taxes administered by the IRD.7 \n \n7.  A  bill  to  introduce  a  value-added tax  (VAT)  is  nearing  completion, with  final  policy \napprovals and enactment expected in late 2021 for implementation in 2023. The current Goods \nTax Act (1992), Sales Tax Act (1990), Stamp Duties Act (1940), and their associated regulations \nwill be repealed with the introduction of a VAT. The customs duty on most imported goods will be \nremoved, with the VAT levied on all imports, including any that remain subject to customs duty \nand excises. Modeling to determine the VAT rate and level of business turnover which requires \nregistering for a VAT has been based on these reforms being revenue neutral. The introduction \nof the VAT will be a substantial change for the IRD and the business community, particularly large \nbusinesses, who will need to comply with the various obligations and reporting requirements. \n \n8.  A review of the Income Tax Act (1992) is scheduled for 2022, with a revised act to be \nfinalized following work on the VAT. The Income Tax Act is expected to replace the current \ncommissioner-imposed  assessment  system  with  self-assessment  by  taxpayers,  enabling \ntaxpayers to meet their tax payment obligations in a timely manner. The income tax review will \nalso likely review the income tax rate and threshold analysis, taxation of noncash benefits, \ntaxation of small businesses, and general modernization of the legislation. \n \n9.  Overview of the tax administration system. Government revenues are generated \nmainly from direct and indirect taxation (covering income taxes, consumption taxes, and border \n \n6  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 2020.

Honiara. \n7  The Tax Administration Bill was presented to Parliament in August 2021. \n \n ", "3 \ntaxes), with a smaller contribution from nontax revenue, such as revenue from fishing licenses.8 \nThe IRD administers nine categories of taxes, other than customs duty and excises. The IRD is \nthe  central  tax  administration  authority,  with  most  staff  and  functions  concentrated  in  the \nheadquarters office in Honiara and two small tax branches in the provinces.9 The IRD has 118 staff, \nof which 69 are male and 49 female. Men make up most senior positions in the IRD, including all \nthree executive team members, 18 of the 25 middle managers, and 22 of the 36 senior officers. \nThe Customs and Excise Division (CED) collects revenue from customs duty levied on most \nimports and selected exports (primarily round logs), along with duty in lieu of excises on certain \nimported goods. In addition, the CED collects excises on selected products (tobacco and alcohol) \nfrom domestic producers and collects the goods tax on imported goods on behalf of the IRD. \n \n10.  Inland  Revenue  Division\u2019s  structure  outdated.  Over  the  last  2  decades,  tax \nadministration reforms have focused on moving from a tax type structure to a functional structure, \nwith a focus on compliance of high-risk taxpayers.10 The IRD is not structured as a modern \nfunctional organization. The organizational structure of the IRD is a hybrid between a tax type and \nfunctional structure, which provides for isolated administration of each tax without applying \ntaxpayer data across the multiple taxes. This creates a significant burden for taxpayers, as \ninformation is not shared across the different teams within the IRD.11 There is also an inability to \nflexibly use staff across the IRD as staff skills are largely confined to a particular tax. \n \n11.  Alongside the review of the tax framework, which began in late 2017, the government, with \nsupport from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), started a review of the \ntax administration arrangements.12 One of the changes being implemented is moving to a \nfunctional structure where staff are grouped by type of work rather than the type of tax, business, \nproduct, or customer. Grouping together activities that require similar skills will (i) support the \nachievement of gains through increased depth of knowledge in core areas of business expertise; \nand (ii) contribute to reduced compliance and administrative costs, simplification, and improved \nservice levels.13 Some of the changes that have been implemented include creating a large \ntaxpayer office and risk management unit, and appointing four assistant deputy commissioners. \n \n12.  Current tax administration information system. The IRD first introduced a specialized \nTAIS in 2005. The current TAIS is configured to support different business processes for each type of \nrevenue (to support a tax type focus) and creates isolated data repositories and systems within the IRD. \nThe current TAIS limits the IRD\u2019s ability to use the data it collects to perform analysis for strategic \ndecisions and improve business processes and compliance activities. While the IRD has focused \non automating the registration of taxpayers and allowing for e-tax filing and payments, the current \nTAIS does not support a shift to a modern functional structure and continues to constrain the \nIRD\u2019s performance, ultimately limiting domestic resource mobilization. \n \n \n8 The export duty on round logs, income tax, and the goods tax (levied on imported and domestically manufactured \ngoods) each accounted for about 20% of total domestic sourced revenue in 2020. Nontax revenue (mainly from the \nsale of fishing licenses) accounted for a further 10%, with the remaining 30% of domestically sourced revenue \ncomprising import duty, excises, sales tax, stamp duty, and other fees and charges.

A modern TAIS (i) plays a substantial role in understanding the taxpayer base by enabling \nthe government to identify unregistered and potential taxpayers and to manage the life cycle of \ntaxpayer registration, tax assessment, collection, and reporting; (ii) facilitates efficient business \nprocesses, data sharing, risk management, reporting, and analysis to inform strategic direction \nand detailed compliance activities; and (iii) is essential to reap the benefits of moving to a \nfunctional organizational structure. Making better use of the available data encourages a more \nefficient way of working and better use of finite resources. The upgrading of TAIS capabilities \nfacilitates a transition from the current authority-administered system to a self-assessment-\nfocused audit. Compliance activities are undertaken according to a risk management approach. \nA  more  holistic  approach  also  complements  enhanced  taxpayer-focused  engagement  and \ncommunication, which is necessary to encourage voluntary compliance. The government\u2019s TAIS \nvendor\u2019s latest product can meet these requirements.14 \n \n14.  Tax system disincentivizes women\u2019s participation in the formal economy. While the \nlabor force participation rate is 71.4%, only 62.4% of women are in the labor force, compared to \n80.3% of men. As many as 75% of employed women\u2014compared to 54% of men\u2014are in \nvulnerable employment and unpaid family work.15 Based on anecdotal evidence, an underlying \ncause is that the tax system can be both a perceived and real disincentive for women to engage \nin the formal economy. Tax systems impact men and women differently, but gender analyses of \ntax systems and changes have rarely been considered. The current TAIS does not collect sex-\ndisaggregated data. There is limited understanding of the implications and benefits of the tax \nsystem among formal and informal women entrepreneurs. Within government agencies, women \nare less likely to be involved in decision-making on tax policy and administration. While women \ncomprise 42% of the IRD\u2019s workforce, only 28% are in senior positions. \n \n15.  Strategic alignment. The project\u2019s focus on improved public sector management aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority 6 (strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity), and operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality, by mainstreaming \ngender equality into operations). Supporting tax reform is a key element of ADB\u2019s Pacific \nApproach, 2021\u20132025, by preparing and responding to shocks through strengthening domestic \nrevenues and rolling out online systems and capacity building.16 The project is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for 11 small Pacific island countries, 2021\u20132023.17 The project \nmodality is appropriate to deliver the support needed by the government and is aligned with \ngovernment and ADB strategies. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n16.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: sustained and inclusive economic growth \nand funding for health, education, and social protection improved (footnote 4). The project will \nhave the following outcome: domestic resource mobilization improved.18 \n \n17.  Output 1: Tax administration restructured along functional lines, and staff trained \nin new roles and business processes.

The reforms will consider female employees of the IRD and their \ncareer advancement opportunities. CED staff will also be provided with training given their role in \ncollecting some taxes on behalf of the IRD, including the VAT. Once trained, IRD staff will be \nempowered  to  devote  additional  time  and  resources  to  collecting  additional  revenue  from \ndomestic taxpayers. \n \n18.  Output 2: A new fit-for-purpose tax administration information system acquired, and \ntax administration staff trained on how to obtain the greatest benefit from its use. The IRD \nwill procure an upgraded version of its current TAIS through direct contracting. The upgraded \nTAIS will be tested and made fully functional under this output. This will expand its current \nfunctionality, i.e., improve management reporting, add a VAT module, collect sex-disaggregated \ndata, and incorporate the latest security features to improve the integrity of the tax system and \nhelp prevent fraud. The TAIS provider will be required to provide comprehensive training to IRD \nstaff to utilize the upgraded TAIS and ensure that there is compatibility with other government \nsystems such as the CED\u2019s computerized information system and the financial management \ninformation system of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). The project will also fund the \nTAIS\u2019s license fees and maintenance costs during project implementation and the acquisition of \nnew associated hardware and equipment. An upgraded TAIS will enable the IRD to better monitor \ntaxpayers, provide higher quality management information to direct resources where they are \nneeded, and contribute to better taxpayer compliance. This will contribute to higher government \nrevenues. \n \n19.  Output 3: Inland Revenue Division capacity for gender-responsive and effective tax \neducation and taxpayer services improved. With significant changes to the tax administrative \narrangements and the introduction of a VAT, a comprehensive taxpayer education program will \nbe rolled out to individuals, businesses, and others such as tax agents. The IRD and the project \nconsultants will design and deliver the outreach program. Specific attention will be given to women \ntaxpayers,  including  women  micro  and  small  entrepreneurs.  A  gender-responsive  public \ninformation campaign on the tax system, including the VAT, will be part of the outreach program. \nSex-disaggregated surveys at the beginning and end of the project will also assess if taxpayers \nhave had improved experiences with the IRD. Greater understanding among taxpayers of their \nobligations will lead to higher levels of domestic resource mobilization. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  ADB support has included technical assistance on tax policy, tax modeling, and legislative \ndrafting.19 ADB is providing technical assistance to support ongoing policy work to develop a VAT \nand review the income tax framework (paras. 7 and 8; and footnote 19). In addition, ADB has \nincluded tax reforms in its previous policy-based operation, and a future policy-based operation \nwill build on these reforms.20 Additionally, ADB is working with the government, the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), and the PFTAC to prepare a medium-term revenue strategy. Finally, ADB \nwill  support  the  government  to  strengthen  knowledge  and  capacity  on  tax  policy  and \n \n19 ADB. 2017. Establishment of the Domestic Resource Mobilization Trust Fund.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  With the analyses (footnotes 12 and 13) and ongoing support from the PFTAC, the IRD is \nwell-placed  to  continue  its  restructuring.25  This  technical  analysis  provides  the  rationale, \nrestructuring sequence, and a basis for the work to be undertaken during project implementation. \n \n28.  The technical specifications of the TAIS to be acquired under the project were developed \nby experts in tax administration and circulated to selected prospective vendors during project \npreparation. This roadshow confirmed that to minimize cost, the TAIS will be commercial off-the-\nshelf software, which requires only limited customization. The IRD currently utilizes commercial \noff-the-shelf software, and this has proven to be adequate for its needs.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  The project is considered economically viable, with the base-case results showing an \neconomic internal rate of return of 13%.26 The economic benefits include cost savings because \nof a more efficient tax administration, savings in avoided costs associated with the current TAIS \nsystem, and economic benefits from development spending associated with increased revenue \ncollections from more efficient tax administration. Sensitivity analysis was also undertaken to \nfurther test the economic viability of the project. The results indicate that the project is still \neconomically viable in the following scenarios: (i) 10% increase in costs, (ii) 10% increase in costs \nand 10% decrease in benefits, and (iii) no cost increase and 30% reduction in the economic \nbenefit achieved from increased revenue collection. The financial analysis concludes that the \nproject\u2019s incremental recurrent cost impact on the budget expenditures of the IRD will be relatively \nsmall and is fully manageable by the government.27 The government has assured ADB that \nstarting in 2027, it will allocate adequate resources to cover the maintenance costs of the TAIS. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n30.  The economic life of the project is estimated to be 15 years. Following the end of the 5-\nyear project, the IRD will pay annual TAIS maintenance costs, which are estimated to be   \nper year  of the 2021 budget), and the cost of an updated or replacement TAIS after 10 \nyears, at a cost of  . The government has paid all fees and enhancement costs since the \noriginal TAIS was installed. Further, the government has stated that it will pay these expenses, \ngiven the importance of a working TAIS for revenue collection, and the small marginal cost \nincreases to maintain the TAIS. The project is considered financially sustainable (footnote 27). \n \n \n \n25 For further technical analysis, please refer to the following: PFTAC. 2020.

Governance \n \n31.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial (footnote 23). This \nis a result of a substantial rating for the inherent risk (country system and implementing agency) \nand a substantial control risk rating for the project financial management elements of the MOFT. \nWhen proposed mitigation measures are considered, the overall fiduciary risk will be moderate. \n \n32.  The assessed pre-mitigation project procurement risk is high (footnote 23). The main \nprocurement is the TAIS package, which will use the direct contracting procurement method. \nProcurement capacity is generally weak in the country and exposed to risks related to weak \nintegration with the budget cycle, integrity issues, and lack of a government e-procurement \nsystem. The project will mitigate the risk from high to medium by engaging a procurement \nspecialist to assist the government in preparing and conducting procurement, and the government \nhas agreed to delegate its consultant selection to ADB. The purchase of new hardware and \nequipment will use the request for quotations procurement method. The strategic procurement \nplan process was undertaken with active participation by the government. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOFT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Poverty  reduction  and  social  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  a  general \nintervention. The project will contribute to broadening the tax base by enhancing tax compliance. \nCreating a more sustainable public revenue base will allow the country to develop a more focused \napproach to allocating resources for its poverty reduction priorities and development strategies. \nThe project team has developed a stakeholder engagement and communication strategy that will \npromote meaningful participation of diverse stakeholders from the government, the private sector, \nwomen entrepreneurs, civil society, and other nongovernment actors to ensure broad-based \nparticipation in initiatives to improve tax administration systems and services.28 \n \n35.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan \n(GAP) will address key gender issues identified and includes proactive gender activities across \nall three outputs.29 The GAP includes measures to (i) improve the quality and management of \nsex-disaggregated taxpayer data, (ii) conduct training and improve practices within the IRD for \nmainstreaming gender equality and social inclusion into IRD human resource management and \ntax administration, and (iii) provide leadership training for female IRD staff. The project\u2019s third \noutput will include conducting gender-responsive public information campaigns on changes to the \ntaxation system and improving the quality and outreach of tax education to women consumers \nand micro and small entrepreneurs. Gender-sensitive indicators and sex-disaggregated targets \nhave been included in the GAP and the project\u2019s design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n28 The stakeholder communication strategy is in the PAM (footnote 23). \n29 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 ADB.

ASSURANCES \n \n41.  The government and the MOFT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \nas described in detail in the PAM and grant documents. \n \n42.  The government and the MOFT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the draft grant agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$5,500,000 to Solomon Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) \nfor the Domestic Resource Mobilization Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n2 September 2021 \n \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nSustained and inclusive economic growth and funding for health, education, and social protection \nimproved (National Development Strategy, 2016\u20132035)a \n  Data Sources \nand Reporting  Risks and Critical \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions \nOutcome     \nDomestic  a.
