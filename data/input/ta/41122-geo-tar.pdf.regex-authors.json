INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  August  2007,  the  Government  of  Georgia  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare the Ajara Bypass Roads Development Project. The ADB \nFact-Finding  Mission  visited  Georgia  from  17  to  21  October  2007  to  process  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  proposal.  The  Mission  held  discussions  with \nconcerned government officials; visited the project area; and carried out an initial poverty and \nsocial analysis and a rapid environmental assessment. This report is based on (i) the agreement \nreached  with  the  Government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost,  financing  and \nimplementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference for the PPTA; and (ii) the \nMission\u2019s findings. The PPTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Georgia is a small, strategically located country in the south Caucasus. Transport plays \na  pivotal  role  in  supporting  the  national  economy  and  serving  as  the  shortest  transit  link \nbetween Central Asia and Europe, as well as between the Russian Federation and Turkey. \nGeorgia\u2019s road network comprises 1,495 kilometers (km) of international, 3,354 km of state, and \n15,480 km of local roads. The county has five major highways, including the east\u2013west highway \nrunning from the port of Poti to the Azerbaijan border, which is the extension of Corridor 2 \nidentified in the recently developed Transport and Trade Facility Strategy under the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. The Georgian railway system is linked to \nthe railway systems of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Russian Federation. The rail lines from \nBatumi and Poti, Georgia\u2019s two major Black Sea ports, connect other southern Caucasian \ncountries (Armenia and Azerbaijan) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan). Recently, \nthe governments of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey agreed to construct the Kars\u2013Aklhalkalaki\u2013\nTbilisi\u2013Baku railway line. \n \n3.  Given the country\u2019s geographic location, development of the transport sector is vital to \nreducing transport costs, increasing transit revenues, and connecting to markets in the region \nand beyond. However, around 10% of the main roads, 30% of secondary roads, and 50% of \nlocal roads in Georgia are in poor condition, leading to higher transport costs, long transit times, \nand  traffic  accidents.  In  response,  the  Government  gives  high  priority  to  road  transport \ninfrastructure development, and plans to reconstruct and rehabilitate major roads and highways \nduring 2008\u20132011 to strengthen access to markets and realize Georgia\u2019s full potential as a \ntransit economy. \n \n4.  The road between Poti and Sarpi at the border with Turkey along the Black Sea coast is \none of Georgia\u2019s main highways. It connects the western part of the country to its capital, Tbilisi, \nand provides an important transit route for international traffic. However, the road section in the \nAjara Autonomous Republic passes through a number of Black Sea resorts such as Batumi and \nKobuleti, which has caused severe traffic congestion and accidents, particularly during the \ntourist seasons. To address this problem, the Government plans to construct two bypass roads \nnear Batumi and Kobuleti to promote transit traffic and improve road safety, and has asked ADB \nto help prepare and finance the project. \n \n5.  The  Government  has  made  important  progress  on  reforms  in  the  transport  sector. \nAdministrative structures have been streamlined resulting in more effective management. The \nRoad Department of the Ministry of Economic Development has oversight for the construction \n                                                 \n1  The PPTA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 19 November 2007. \n ", "2   \nand  maintenance  of  main  and  secondary  roads,  while  local  roads  are  under  the  joint \nresponsibility of the Road Department and local governments. With the adoption of the National \nAnticorruption  Strategy  in  2004  and  subsequently  the  Implementation  Plan  in  2006,  the \nincidence  of  corruption  across  all  sectors  including  transport  has  dropped  significantly,  as \nreported  in  the  latest  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development\u2013World  Bank \nBusiness  Environment  and  Enterprise  Performance  Survey.  Nevertheless,  the  institutional \ncapacity of the Government needs strengthening to meet the challenges of moving to a market \neconomy. \n \n6.  Georgia joined ADB in February 2007. An ADB interim operational strategy for Georgia \n(2008\u20132009)2 currently under preparation identifies the reduction of road transport constraints \non economic activity as a priority area for ADB assistance. The PPTA, which will be the first \nADB assistance for Georgia, is consistent with the proposed interim operational strategy. \n \n7.  Georgia\u2019s road subsector has been receiving assistance from the World Bank, European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation,  and  other \nexternal aid agencies. The World Bank approved a $28.3 million loan for the First East\u2013West \nHighway Improvement Project in 2006 to improve the Natakhari\u2013Agaiani section (16 km) of the \ncountry\u2019s major east\u2013west highway, and is processing phase II of the project for reconstruction \nof the Igoeti\u2013Sveneti section (25 km) of the same highway. It also approved a $27.4 million loan \nfor the Secondary and Local Roads Project in 2004. The European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment  helped  construct  the  new  Tbilisi  international  airport  and  improved \ncommercialization  of  Georgian  railways.  The  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  provided  a \n$102.2 million grant to finance rehabilitation of the Samtskhe\u2013Javakheti road. At the request of \nthe  Government,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  began  preparing  financial \nassistance for improving part of the east\u2013west highway during September\u2013October 2007. The \nPPTA was designed and will be implemented in collaboration with other external aid agencies.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the PPTA is to develop an efficient and safe road transport system in the \nproject areas between Poti and Sarpi in the Ajara Autonomous Republic. This will be achieved \nthrough the preparation of an investment project design agreed to by the Government and ADB. \nThe ensuing project will construct two bypass roads (i.e., the Batumi bypass road and the \nCholoki\u2013Makhinjauri  road,  or  the  Kobuleti  bypass  road)  to  increase  transit  traffic,  reduce \ntransport costs and travel time, and improve road safety. This will contribute to sustainable \neconomic and social development in Georgia, as well as facilitate regional cooperation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  International consultants, with support from national consultants, will be engaged to \nimplement the PPTA. Specifically, the consultants will undertake a feasibility study, which will \ninclude a road subsector analysis (including an institutional and financial analysis), preliminary \nengineering  design,  economic  analysis,  poverty  and  social  analysis,  environmental  impact \nassessment, and resettlement plan. They will help develop a results-based project framework, \nincluding monitoring indicators for development impacts and baseline data. The consultants will \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008. Interim Operational Strategy (2008\u20132009): Georgia. Manila (Draft). \n ", "  3\nutilize the results of the prefeasibility study completed by the Design and Survey Institute of \nGeorgia in 2006. \n \n10.  The initial poverty and social analysis (Appendix 2) and rapid environmental assessment \ncarried out during the Fact-Finding Mission (i) examined poverty status, ethnic minority and \ngender issues, resettlement effects, and environmental conditions in the project areas; and (ii) \nidentified social and environmental issues that need to be further examined and addressed \nduring PPTA implementation. \n \n11.  Key activities will include field surveys; document reviews; data analysis; desk studies; \nand consultation with various stakeholders, including government officials, local communities, \ncivil society, road users, affected people, and external aid agencies. \n \n12.  Two risks have been identified. First, the project is anticipated to have impacts on the \nenvironment and resettlement. The PPTA will undertake due diligence by assessing possible \nimpacts and proposing appropriate mitigation measures. Second, Georgia recently experienced \npolitical  turbulence.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the  PPTA  and  ensuing  investment \nproject  may  change.  ADB  will  closely  monitor  the  situation  in  the  country  during  PPTA \nimplementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $750,000. ADB will provide $600,000 financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. The Government will finance \nthe remainder of the TA cost in kind by providing counterpart staff, furnished office space, and \nlogistical support services. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Road Department of the Ministry of Economic Development will be the Executing \nAgency. It will appoint a coordinator to (i) supervise PPTA activities; (ii) resolve any issues that \nmay  arise  during  implementation;  and  (iii)  facilitate  coordination  among  the  consultants, \ngovernment  agencies,  and  other  stakeholders.  The  Road  Department  will  provide  the \nconsultants  with  the  available  documents,  data,  maps,  and  other  information  needed  to \nimplement the PPTA. \n \n15.  The PPTA will require about 45.5 person-months of consultant inputs (17 international \nand 28.5 national). The international consultant team will comprise a (i) road engineer and team \nleader, (ii) transport economist, (iii) institutional/financial specialist, (iv) environment specialist, \nand (v) social development specialist. They will be supported by national consultants with \nsimilar expertise and experience. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix \n4. ADB will engage an international consulting firm in association with national consultants in \naccordance with the ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) using the quality- and cost-based selection method (80 weighting for quality and 20 \nweighting for cost) and simplified technical proposal procedures. The consultants will purchase \noffice equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The consultants are expected to start services in April 2008 and complete them in \nSeptember 2008. The PPTA is expected to be completed by 31 December 2008. Stakeholder \n ", "4   \nworkshops will be held to review the consultant\u2019s reports. The consultant\u2019s final reports will be \ndisseminated to the public through ADB\u2019s website upon PPTA completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Georgia for preparing the Ajara Bypass Roads Development Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nDevelopment of an  Traffic volume and transit  Traffic counts, vehicle  Continued rapid economic \nefficient and safe road  traffic increased by 10%  operating cost and travel time  growth in Georgia \ntransport system in the  on the project roads after  surveys by the Road   \nproject areas between  project completion  Department of the Ministry of  Risk \nSarpi and Poti in    Economic Development  The political situation in Georgia \nGeorgia\u2019s Ajara  Transport costs reduced    may become unstable \nAutonomous Republic  by 15% on the project  Asian Development Bank \nroads after project  (ADB) project completion \ncompletion  report \n   \nTraffic accidents reduced  Georgian road accident \nby 15% on the project  statistics \nroads after project \ncompletion \nOutcome      Assumption \nDesign of an investment  A memorandum of  ADB PPTA review mission  Timely allocation of counterpart \nproject, which will  understanding on the  reports  funding from the Government\u2019s \nconstruct two bypass  preliminary design of the  budget and cofinancing \nroads (i.e., the Batumi  investment project signed  commitment, if needed, for the \nbypass road and the  upon completion of the  project \nCholoki\u2013Makhinjauri road  project preparatory   \nor the Kobuleti bypass  technical assistance \nroad) prepared and  (PPTA) \nagreed to by the \nGovernment of Georgia \nand ADB \nOutputs      Assumptions \nThe feasibility study for  Feasibility study submitted  Consultant\u2019s final report  Close coordination among \nthe investment project,  by the consultants in    relevant government agencies \nwhich includes a road  September 2008  ADB PPTA review mission  during PPTA implementation \nsubsector analysis,   reports   \npreliminary engineering  Local communities and civil \ndesign, economic  society strongly support the \nanalysis, poverty and  PPTA and actively participate \nsocial analysis,  during PPTA implementation \nenvironmental impact   \nassessment, and  Risk \nresettlement plan  Possible delays in finalizing the \nproject\u2019s resettlement plan \nbecause of the Government\u2019s \nunfamiliarity with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995) \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.1  PPTA approval (January 2008)  ADB: $600,000 (grant) \n1.2  Short-listing of consultants (January 2008)  \u2022 Consultants: $494,000 (17 \n1.3  Invitation for technical proposals from short-listed consultants (February 2008)  person-months international \n1.4  Evaluation of technical proposals from short-listed consultants (March 2008)  and 28.5 person-months  \n1.5  Contract negotiations with the first-ranked consultant (March 2008)  national) \n1.6  Contract award (March 2008)  \u2022 Surveys: $30,000 \n  \u2022 Equipment: $10,000 \n2.1  Commencement of consultant services (April 2008)  \u2022 Miscellaneous support: \n2.2  Submission of the inception report by the consultant (April\u2013May 2008)  $6,000 \n2.3  Fielding of ADB\u2019s PPTA inception mission (April\u2013May 2008)  \u2022 Government representatives \n2.4  Submission of the interim report by the consultant (June 2008) \n ", "6  Appendix 2 \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms  \n2.5  Fielding of ADB\u2019s PPTA review mission (June 2008)  for contract negotiations: \n2.6  Submission of the draft final report by the consultant (August 2008)  $10,000 \n2.7  Fielding of ADB\u2019s final PPTA review mission and holding of the tripartite  \u2022 Contingencies: $50,000 \n  meeting to review the consultant\u2019s draft final report (August\u2013September 2008)   \n2.8  Submission of the final report by the consultant (September 2008)  Government: $150,000 (in kind), \n2.9  Closing of the PPTA account (December 2008)  covering office accommodation, \nremuneration and per diem of \ncounterpart staff, and \nmiscellaneous support services. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Hong Wang            Juan Miranda \n  Officer-in-Charge          Director General \n  CWID              CWRD \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  7 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nCountry/Project Title:  Georgia:  Preparing the Ajara Bypass Roads Development Project \n \nLending/Financing  Project loan  Department/  Central and West Asia \nModality:  Division:  Department, Infrastructure \nDivision \n \nI.  POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  The transport sector helps reduce poverty directly by improving access to markets, creating jobs, and easing delivery of \nsocial services; and indirectly by facilitating economic development. The road between Poti and Sarpi, located along the Black \nSea coast, is an integral part of Georgia\u2019s major road transport corridor. It connects the western part of the country to its \ncapital, Tbilisi; and provides an important transit route for international traffic. In addition, it passes through a number of Black \nSea tourist resorts such as Batumi and Kobuleti, causing severe traffic congestion and accidents, particularly during the tourist \nseasons. The Ajara Bypass Roads Development Project will reduce transport costs, travel time, and road accidents, and \nthereby help (i) facilitate economic development (i.e., transit traffic and tourism), (ii) create jobs, and (iii) improve access to \nsocial services. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: \nThe project will contribute to sustainable economic and social development in Georgia, as well as regional cooperation \nthrough development of two bypass roads in the Ajara Autonomous Republic to increase transit traffic, reduce transport \ncosts and travel time, and improve road safety. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  Not applicable. \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? The Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s technical assistance \nfunding program. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? The opportunities for pro-poor design will be explored during PPTA implementation. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \n \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject?  \n \nThe Government, road users, road construction companies, local residents, and resort tourists are the potential project \nbeneficiaries. The poor and the socially excluded will benefit from the project through (i) the construction and maintenance \nof the project roads, and (ii) development of business activities along the project roads after project completion. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThe early opening of efficient, safe, and sustainable bypass roads in the project areas, with minimum negative social and \nenvironmental impacts. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nThe project entails substantial land acquisition. The preparation and smooth implementation of a resettlement plan may \nconstitute a constraint, because this is ADB\u2019s first assistance to the transport sector and therefore the government officials \nand local communities in Georgia are not familiar with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The PPTA includes \nthe preparation of the resettlement plan in the terms of reference for consultants, and allocates adequate resources to \nenable the consultants to undertake proper surveys and hold consultations with the Government and affected people. \nAdequate consulting services will be provided to support implementation of the resettlement plan under the ensuing \ninvestment project. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.6 The central and local governments, road users, road construction companies, \nlocal business communities, the people to be affected by the project due to land acquisition and resettlement. \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \nWorkshops, interviews, and social surveys. \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment7 \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    The consultation and participation plan will be developed by the \nPPTA consultants. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector8 that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nEqual opportunity between men and women (i) for employment for the construction of project roads, and (ii) for stakeholder \nconsultation and participation. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making? \n  Yes          No    Please explain. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No   The project roads are anticipated to provide equal benefits for women and men. \n \nIII.
