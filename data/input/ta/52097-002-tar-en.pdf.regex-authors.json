The Government of Nepal requested the assistance of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to support the improvement of the capacity, reliability, and safety of road links between \nPokhara, Nepal\u2019s second-largest city, and Mugling, a central junction of the strategic road network \nthat further links to Kathmandu, the administrative and economic capital; and Bharatpur, Nepal\u2019s \nfourth-largest city and a gateway to the East\u2013West Highway and international markets. The \nproject will finance the first phase of upgrading the Mugling\u2013Pokhara Highway, and will (i) \nrehabilitate and widen to four lanes the 81-kilometer (km) section between Abukhaireni and \nPokhara, and (ii) increase awareness and strengthen the capacity of the Department of Roads \n(DOR) in road safety and disaster risk reduction. \n \n2.  The project will directly support economic growth by (i) lowering transport costs and \nreducing logistics constraints; (ii) improving accessibility to domestic markets, jobs, and social \nservices;  (iii)  enhancing  national  connectivity  between  Pokhara  and  Kathmandu;  and  (iv) \nfacilitating access to international markets through Bharatpur and India. Consequently, the project \nis expected to (i) promote the development of the private sector and competitive export supply \nchains in Pokhara and its hinterland, (ii) increase domestic and international trade, (iii) improve \nregional integration, and (iv) leverage Pokhara\u2019s tourism potential. The project will be supported \nby an attached technical assistance (TA) that will improve road safety and traffic management; \ndevelop a disaster risk reduction system for road sections between Pokhara, Narayanghat, and \nNaubise; and strengthen the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies in project \nimplementation, procurement, and contract management. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Road  safety.  Vehicle  sales  increased  by  17.5%  annually  during  FY2007\u2013FY2017, \nalthough vehicle ownership remains low, with only 0.11 vehicles per capita.1 The vehicle fleet \nincreased from about 0.7 million in FY2009 to 3.2 million in FY2018, and is expected to quadruple \nby 2029. The high proportion of motorcycles increases road safety risks, as the frequency and \nseverity of motorcycle accidents exceed that of other vehicle classes, particularly on deteriorated \npavement. Reported traffic accidents increased from 3,800 in FY2002 to 13,580 in FY2013, an \nannual increase of 12.3%, while fatalities increased from 879 in FY2002 to 2,385 in FY2017, an \nannual increase of 6.8%.2 Accidents and fatalities are likely to be underreported, particularly in \nthe case of minor accidents and injuries; there are about 15.9 traffic fatalities per 100,000 people.3 \n \n4.  The project road includes an 81 km section of the Mugling\u2013Pokhara Highway between \nAbukhaireni and Pokhara, and two major bridges at Madi and Seti. The project road is a two-lane \ncarriageway that carries about 7,400 vehicles per day, including 14% of goods vehicles and up to \n55% of motorcycles in urban areas. Daily traffic is forecast to increase to about 13,000 vehicles \nby 2040, and the rising number of motorcycles creates significant road safety risks, notably as \nthe project road (i) has a pavement in poor condition,4 (ii) does not segregate slow-moving \n                                                \n1  Government of Nepal, Department of Transport Management. 2018.

Compared with 15.3 fatalities \nper 100,000 people in Bangladesh, 17.4 in Bhutan, 22.6 in India and 14.9 in Sri Lanka.  \n4  The average international roughness index along the road ranges from 4.1 to 26.2, compared to an index of 2.0\u20132.5 \nfor a pavement in good condition. \n ", "2 \nvehicles and pedestrians in urban areas, and (iii) has winding hilly sections. The project will widen \nthe road to four lanes to cater to increasing demand, and design standards feature enhanced \ngeometry, pavement, structure, and drainage; and safety features to improve sustainability, safety \nawareness, and safety compliance. The road will be median divided, and service lanes in urban \nareas will improve safety, particularly for women and children who are more likely to walk, ride a \nbicycle, or use public transport than men. \n \n5.  Intelligent transport system. The detailed design of the project road includes several \nroad safety considerations; however, it does not include an advanced intelligent transport system \n(ITS), in which the DOR has limited expertise. An ITS involves a combination of infrastructure and \npioneering  information  and  communication  technologies  used  in  transport  and  traffic \nmanagement systems to improve the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transport networks \nand enhance road users\u2019 experiences and attitudes toward safer mobility. ITS can involve (i) high-\nlevel infrastructure and services to assess and accommodate future changes in travel patterns, \n(ii) mid-level components to strengthen safety and traffic flows dynamically, and (iii) field-level \ncomponents for basic traffic control and monitoring services. Key attributes used to determine the \nappropriate level of ITS deployments in a country may include available ITS technologies, existing \nphysical elements, legal and institutional constraints, desired ITS services and levels of service, \nfinancial  resources  availability,  and  the  social  and  cultural  context.5  This  TA  will  assist  in \nformulating an intelligent traffic management and information system (ITMIS) for the Mugling\u2013\nPokhara  Highway,  including  for  the  major  junctions  within  5  km  east  of  Mugling  toward \nKathmandu, and 5 km south of Mugling toward Narayanghat. \n \n6.  Landslide monitoring and management system. The project road traverses the mid-\nhill region of Nepal, and is within an inherently weak geological zone characterized by active \ntectonics, where triggers such as intense rainfall and earthquakes make the mountains highly \nvulnerable to landslides, floods, and other mass-wasting processes. In the past, landslides \ncaused by earth movements, rainfall, or erosion along the project road have blocked sections and \nled to human casualties, property losses, and environmental degradation. Therefore, ensuring the \nstability of slopes is crucial for the prevention and forecasting of landslides. The project includes \nmitigation measures such as retaining walls, slope protection, and bioengineering techniques \nwhere relevant. However, monitoring the displacements of a slope can provide information about \nthe dynamics of the landslide phenomenon. The landslide monitoring and management system \n(LMMS) may involve remote sensing techniques, photogrammetric techniques, ground-based \nsurvey, and/or real-time geotechnical monitoring. The TA will conduct a feasibility study to identify \nwhich techniques are recommended for implementation on the project road and other landslide-\nsensitive areas in Nepal, and design an LMMS to strengthen disaster risk resilience. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s intervention. The project will address infrastructure bottlenecks in the mid-hill \nregion of Nepal. The transaction TA will complement infrastructure improvements by (i) supporting \ncapacity building and institutional strengthening of MOPIT and DOR; and (ii) supporting road \nsafety and disaster risk reduction on the project road, as well as the Mugling\u2013Narayanghat and \nMugling\u2013Naubise road sections where relevant. As ADB\u2019s pipeline in the strategic road sector is \nincreasing, with large projects and contract packages, the TA also aims to strengthen the capacity \nof MOPIT and DOR in project implementation, mainly by providing training courses, workshops, \nand ad hoc expertise on procurement and contract management. The TA will implement the \nfollowing  key  activities:  (i)  a  feasibility  study  for  an  ITMIS  for  Mugling\u2013Pokhara,  Mugling\u2013\n                                                \n5  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. 2017.

Bangkok. \n ", "3 \nNarayanghat, and Mugling\u2013Naubise; (ii) a feasibility study for the preparation of an LMMS; and \n(iii) capacity strengthening of MOPIT and DOR in procurement and contract management. \n \n8.  Technical assistance modality. The TA has been prepared at the request of MOPIT, \nwhich sought ADB\u2019s assistance to increase the capacity of DOR in road safety, ITS, landslide \nmonitoring and management, and procurement and contract management. ADB and MOPIT \ndefined  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  TA  modality  is \nproposed, rather than a loan subcomponent, because it will improve the likelihood of achieving \nthe proposed outputs and outcome of the loan-financed activities by (i) continuing the long-term \npartnership of the government and ADB on policy dialogue and capacity development; (ii) \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  MOPIT  and  DOR  with  regard  to  identified  knowledge  and \nmanagement gaps, particularly considering the negative impacts of landslides experienced during \nthe construction and operation of Mugling\u2013Narayanghat Road; (iii) identifying potential high-level \ntechnology options for future road designs; and (iv) enhancing project implementation capacity. \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Nepal, 2019\u20132021.6 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Intelligent traffic management and information system for road safety \ndeveloped. The TA will review the design of the Mugling\u2013Pokhara Highway and prepare technical \nand functional specifications of the ITMIS for the Mugling\u2013Pokhara Highway, and will support \nfeasibility and procurement preparation by undertaking the following activities: \n(i)  study  and forecast  traffic  volumes  and  traffic flow  patterns  along the  Prithvi \n(Naubise\u2013Pokhara) and Mugling\u2013Narayanghat highways; \n(ii)  conduct a road safety audit of Mugling\u2013Pokhara Highway and propose suitable \ntraffic safety features and road furniture including traffic signals, signs, markings, \noverhead sign boards, crash barriers, delineators, and service areas; \n(iii)  conduct an accident survey of the road section and propose necessary measures \nto reduce accidents, including recommendations for an accident response system; \n(iv)  recommend road safety measures at intersections and major settlement areas; \n(v)  identify suitable ITS and traffic control station locations, prepare a schematic \ndesign and technical specification for each component proposed, including traffic \nlights,  sparkle  studs,  advanced  traffic  management  system,  average  speed \ncameras, advance warning signs, a vehicle detection system, dynamic message \nsigns, closed-circuit television, a road weather information system, weighbridges, \nand/or an emergency management system; \n(vi)  design the ITMIS for the road section, including technical specifications, cost \nestimates and bid documents for system procurement, installation, maintenance, \nand in-house training events; \n(vii)  prepare guidelines for the installation and operation and maintenance of the ITMIS; \nand \n(viii)  conduct ITS workshops for MOPIT, DOR, and other relevant stakeholders. \n \n10.  Output 2: Landslide monitoring and management system for disaster risk reduction \ndeveloped. The TA will \n(i)  review and update the landslide management manual published by DOR and \nsuggest necessary upgrades and improvements; \n(ii)  identify at least three possible locations along national highways that require an \nLMMS  at  potential  landslide  areas  (including  between  Mugling  and  Kurintar, \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2018.
