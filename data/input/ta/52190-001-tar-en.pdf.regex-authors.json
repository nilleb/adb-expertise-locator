The portfolio of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) has been realigned to multisector projects and moved to municipal and county levels, to \ntackle the rural, environmental, and regional development challenges in the PRC. Such projects \nare highly complex and challenging to realize, and their success hinges on the capacity of the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies.  During  the  2017  country  program  mission,  the \nGovernment of the PRC requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) to build the capacity \nof the executing and implementing agencies in the PRC for better project implementation. ADB \nincluded the proposed transaction TA facility in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 \nfor the PRC.1  \n \n2.  As of 31 December 2017, ADB\u2019s portfolio in the PRC had 91 active loan projects for a net \namount of $12.7 billion. The performance of the portfolio has been declining, although it is still far \nabove ADB average.2 More projects encountered implementation delays. About 41.7% of them \nrequired extensions, and the average period of extension increased from 1 year to 2.1 years in \n2017. The average age of the projects based on the year of loan effectiveness increased steadily \nfrom 3.2 in 2013 to 3.8 in 2017. In 2017, 36 loans had implementation period of 6 or more years\u2014\n12 loans of 6 years, 14 of 7 years, 7 of 8 years, and 3 of 9 years. Changes in project scope \nbecame frequent. In 2017 alone, 47 minor changes were made to PRC projects. In addition, the \nnumber of projects with an actual problem rating increased.3 The complexity of the projects and \nthe weak capacity of executing and implementing agency staff at municipal and township levels \ncontributed the most to these problems. \n \n3.  From 2010 to 2017, the proportion of multisector projects in the PRC portfolio increased \ndramatically, from about 15% to about 50%. Moreover, the projects that intended to address \nenvironmental challenges and urban development issues increased to 56% of the portfolio in the \nPRC. To implement these projects, multilevel government administration and multiple project \nimplementation units are involved. A large proportion of the executing and implementing agencies \nare  at  municipal  and  county  level,  or  even  at  township  level.  Their  staff  shoulder  key \nresponsibilities  in  project  implementation  but  have  little  or  no  experience  in  working  with \ninternational financial institutions. They need to be equipped with knowledge and skills for project \nmanagement; familiarized with ADB\u2019s policies, guidelines, and procedures; and enabled to find \npractical solutions to specific operational issues. \n \n4.  Since 1987 when ADB began operations in the country, ADB and the Government of the \nPRC have made various efforts to boost the executing and implementing agencies\u2019 capacity \nacross different areas of a project cycle. These efforts were successful in giving the agencies the \ntools  to  prepare  and  implement  projects  funded  by  ADB  and  other  international  financial \ninstitutions. However, now that ADB\u2019s portfolio in the PRC has evolved and project administration \nmoves to counties and townships, fresh demand for capacity building arises. Most of the new \nexecuting and implementing agencies comes across an externally funded project for the first time. \nADB\u2019s requirements, guidelines, and practices are totally new to them. It is imperative to introduce \nthem  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  procedures.  Staff  at  these  agencies  also  need  broad  and \nfundamental knowledge and skills to manage different project implementation aspects, such as \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n2 ADB. 2018. 2018 Annual Evaluation Review. Manila. \n3 ADB. 2018. 2017 Annual Portfolio Performance Report. Manila. \n ", "2 \nproject management and contract management. Moreover, to be able to handle day-to-day \nimplementation issues in a timely manner, they need to find practical solutions and good practices \nin the county context.  \n \n5.  In addition, the training efficiency and effectiveness could be further improved. It is \nimportant to deliver the right knowledge and skills to the right person at the right time. Within the \nsame topic, different roles in project implementation require different levels of training. Within the \nsame  role,  staff  will  need  different  depths  of  knowledge  at  different  stages  of  project \nimplementation. Taking procurement as an example, it may be enough for the director of a project \nmanagement office to understand the general principles and the differences between ADB and \ngovernment practices, whereas a procurement officer needs to know every aspect of procurement \nin detail and requires more training than a generic session on procurement guidelines. To tackle \ncomplex procurement issues, the procurement officer also needs practical training on  issues \nencountered in daily tasks. \n \n6.  The proposed TA facility will help the government develop the capacity of executing and \nimplementing  agencies  for  managing  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  PRC.  It  builds  on  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  a  previous  capacity-building  TA.4 That TA  contributed to the \nanalysis  of  training  needs  and  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  training  program  for \nexecuting and implementing agencies. The analysis showed that the demand for training by \ncounty and township staff is overwhelming and that the training topics requested go far beyond \nthe scope of current courses available at ADB. These training needs cover project management; \nprocurement; contract management; financial management; ADB\u2019s safeguards (resettlement, \nenvironment,  indigenous  peoples);  disbursement; monitoring  of gender targets;  and  project \nperformance evaluation. For each topic, different levels of detail were requested, and in addition \nto the theoretical knowledge, staff also requested practical experience in almost all topics. \n \n7.  The comprehensive training program consists of 20 courses grouped into 6 categories \nthat are tailored to different positions within a project management office. 5 Of the 20 training \ncourses, 9 shall be newly developed covering project management, contract management, project \nperformance  evaluation,  and  hands-on  training  on  procurement,  financial  management, \nsafeguards, and disbursement. In 2017, the earlier TA (footnote 4) developed a training course \non project management for the directors of project management offices. The proposed TA facility \nwill support the development of the remaining eight training courses with the assistance of \nconsultants and guided by ADB specialists. The new training courses will mainly focus on hands-\non experience and practical solutions for each topic. \n \n8.  The training program for the executing and implementing agencies will be implemented \nsystematically,  i.e.,  training  will  be  targeted  at  staff  according  to  their  roles  in  project \nimplementation and the specific implementation stage of their projects. The TA facility will cover \ncross-sharing of operational experiences between the executing and implementing agencies as \nit is another effective way of obtaining practical knowledge. The TA facility will provide project \nimplementation support to the executing and implementing agencies of all ongoing projects in the \nPRC, and it will be expanded to new executing and implementing agencies of new projects to be \ncommitted in 2018 and thereafter. \n                                                \n4   ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Capacity Building on Operational Knowledge.   \nManila (TA 9165-PRC). \n5 The six categories comprise procurement, financial management and disbursement, safeguard policies, project \nmanagement, project monitoring and evaluation, and other topics (such as cutting-edge technical knowledge). On \neach subject, general and/or advanced as well as hands-on training courses are proposed to meet the executing and \nimplementing agencies\u2019 needs.  \n ", "    3 \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  The TA facility is to enhance the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies in \nthe PRC for better project implementation through targeted, practical, and systematic training \ncourses and knowledge-sharing activities. The outputs are (i) development of tailor-made training \ncourses  on  procurement,  financial  management,  safeguards,  disbursement,  contract \nmanagement,  and  project  performance  evaluation;  (ii)  training  workshops,  which  will  be \nsystematically provided to staff of the executing and implementing agencies, based on the staff\u2019s \nrole in project implementation and the implementation stage of their projects; and (iii) knowledge-\nsharing activities, to share knowledge and experiences in various areas of project management \namong the executing and implementing agencies in the PRC. \n \n10.  Output  1:  Development  of  tailor-made  training  courses.  The  hands-on  training \ncourses  on  procurement,  financial  management,  safeguards,  disbursement,  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \nlnternationale  Des  lng\u00e9nieurs  Conseils  (FIDIC)  and  contract  management,  and  project \nperformance evaluation will be developed with the assistance of consultants. The training will \nfocus on the common issues encountered by the executing and implementing agencies in the \nPRC during project implementation in the respective area. Developing these courses requires the \njoint efforts of ADB specialists and consultants who have practical experience in the respective \nareas of project implementation. \n \n11.  Output 2: Training workshops. Systematic training will be provided to the staff of \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  on  procurement,  financial  management,  safeguards, \ndisbursement, as well as project management, contract management, and project performance \nevaluation. The targeted staff will be invited to participate in the training course(s) based on their \nroles in project implementation. In general, two training workshops on procurement, project \nmanagement, and FIDIC and contract management and one training workshop on financial \nmanagement, safeguards, disbursement, and project performance evaluation will be carried out \nevery year. In total, it is planned to conduct about twenty training workshops under this output. \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge-sharing activities. Knowledge sharing among the executing and \nimplementing agencies in the PRC will be promoted through thematic workshops, country portfolio \nreview missions, best practice sharing, and provincial visits, among other avenues. By the end of \n2017, ADB had financed 248 loans in the PRC, of which 91 are ongoing. Abundant experiences \nand lessons in implementing ADB-financed projects in the PRC have accumulated in the years of \nADB\u2019s engagement with the PRC. Under the TA facility, the good experiences and practices will \nbe abstracted and shared with the executing and implementing agencies of ongoing projects. At \nleast five knowledge-sharing events will be carried out under the TA facility. In addition, the TA \nfacility will also cover the cost of resource persons as needed, such as technical expertise for \nintroducing new technologies.        \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,400,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  cost \nestimates, financing plan, and key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The government \nwill provide counterpart support in the form of office space for consultation meetings, domestic \ntransportation for all participants, shared accommodation when appropriate, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA facility working closely with the PRC counterparts. The East \nAsia Department\u2019s PRC Resident Mission will lead the implementation of the TA facility in close \ncoordination with the Office of the Director General and relevant sector divisions of the East Asia \nDepartment, and other departments of ADB as necessary. This includes selecting, administering, \nand  supervising  the  consultants,  developing  training  materials,  and  conducting  training \nworkshops and knowledge-sharing events. The implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 1.  \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  September 2018\u2013December 2020 \nExecuting agency  EARD, ADB  \nImplementing agency  People\u2019s Republic of China Resident Mission, EARD \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with its Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated PAIs and \nTA Staff Instructionsa \n  Individual selection  1 international expert  $40,000 \n(3 person-months) \n  Individual selection  9 national experts  $235,000 \n(29 person-months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EARD = East Asia Department, PAI = project administration instruction, TA = \ntechnical assistance. \na PAIs 2.02, 2.03, 2.06, 2.07 and 5.09 will be used as a reference until these are updated and replaced by staff \ninstructions. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following its Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.6 Consultants will be selected using the individual consultant selection method, \nand lump-sum or output-based contracts will be considered for their services. The single-source \nselection method will be used to engage the trainers involved in the previous capacity-building TA \n(footnote 4) to continue the training initiated, as well as consultants from specialized agencies \nsuch as F\u00e9d\u00e9ration lnternationale Des lng\u00e9nieurs Conseils and resource persons needed to \nintroduce new technologies. \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Enhancing the Capacity of Executing and \nImplementing Agencies for Better Project Implementation, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                \n6  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem           Amount \n \nAsian Development Bank a \n \n1  Consultants \n   \na.
