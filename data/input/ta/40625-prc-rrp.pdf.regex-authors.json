An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary environmental impact assessment was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and posted on the ADB website on 5 June 2009. \n   \nProject Description  The Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project (the Project) \nwill be ADB's first project to support bus rapid transit (BRT) in the \nPRC. BRT is an efficient public transport system that provides \nmajor benefits for passengers and bus operators and reduces fuel \nconsumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The Project is part \nof ADB's initiative to support greener, more sustainable transport \nin the PRC and includes support for an application to use the \nClean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. It consists \nof  four  components  under  ADB  financing:  (i)  constructing  and \nreconstructing 33.8 kilometers (km) urban roads, including bus \nrapid  transit  BRT  facilities  and  non-motorized  transport  (NMT) \nlanes;  (ii)  introducing  advanced  traffic  management; \n(iii)  implementing an advanced environmental monitoring system; \nand (iv) building capacity to support project implementation and \nBRT operation and management.  \n   \nRationale  Lanzhou,  the  capital  of  Gansu  Province,  is  a  regional  hub \nbetween the eastern and western regions of the PRC. Home to \n3.1 million inhabitants, it is the economic, political, and cultural \ncenter of Gansu. The city has four distinct development zones, \nthree of which are on the south bank of the Yellow River, where \nthe business, commerce, and government centers are located. \nThe fourth zone is on the north bank of the river at Anning. The \nLanzhou municipal government (LMG) has adopted a strategy of \n\"one river, two centers, seven groups\" as a key concept of its \nurban master plan to optimize land use and the economic and \nsocial functions of the city. It has decided to develop a second city \ncenter  in  Anning.  As  Anning  will  become  the  new  political, \nadministrative, economic, and cultural center of the city, there will \nbe a significant increase in demand for transport to, from, and \nwithin Anning. The Project will contribute to realizing the urban \nmaster plan by supporting the development of the urban road \nnetwork and the urban mass transport system serving the new city \ncenter. It will focus on providing a sustainable urban transport \nsystem in Lanzhou. \n ", "ii \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be sustainable economic growth, \neffective  environmental  improvement,  and  improved  quality  of \nurban life in Anning. The outcome will be an efficient, safe, and \nclean urban road transport system. The Project will (i) generate \ncertified emission reductions, (ii) increase average bus speeds on \nthe  BRT  corridor,  (iii)  increase  the  share  of  public  transport, \n(iv) shorten the average travel time, and (v) lower accident rates \nfor vehicles and NMT. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $480.27 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $21.42 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Amount      % \nAsian Development Bank  150.00    31.3 \nBank of China      240.31    50.0 \nLanzhou Municipal Government  89.96    18.7 \n   Total     480.27     100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA loan of $150 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate\u2013based lending facility. The loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate\u2013based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nAllocation and Relending  The loan will be made to the PRC. The Government will make the \nTerms  loan  proceeds  available  to  the  Gansu  provincial  government \n(GPG) on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB \nloan, with GPG bearing the foreign exchange and interest rate \nvariation risks of the ADB loan. GPG will then make the loan \nproceeds available to LMG on the same terms and conditions as \nthose of the ADB loan, with LMG bearing the foreign exchange \nand interest rate variation risks of the ADB loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  LMG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  LMG  has \nArrangements  established a project steering committee (PSC) with responsibility \nfor implementing the Project. LMG has established and staffed a \nproject  management  office  that  will  coordinate  project \nmanagement;  supervise  the procurement  of the  works, goods, \nand  services  to  be  financed  under  the  Project;  monitor  the \nutilization  of  the  ADB  loan,  domestic  bank  funding,  and \nGovernment funding; and prepare and review the reports to be \nsubmitted to ADB and the Government. \n ", "iii \nExecuting Agency  LMG \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and services will be procured in accordance with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  International  competitive  bidding,  national  competitive \nbidding,  or  shopping  procedures  will  be  used  for  procurement \naccording to the circumstances of each contract package. \n   \nConsulting Services  ADB  will  finance  22  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  and  65  person-months  of  national  for  (i)  reforming \nstrategy and policy on traffic demand management, (ii) planning \nBRT operation and management, (iii) planning NMT development, \n(iv) reviewing the BRT detailed design, and (v) building capacity \nfor  BRT  operation  and  management.  The  consultants  to  be \nfinanced under the ADB loan will be selected and engaged based \non  a  simplified  technical  proposal  using  the quality-  and cost-\nbased  selection  method  and  using  the  individual  consultant \nselection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nGovernment  will  engage  and  finance  qualified  consultants  for \ndetailed  engineering  design,  construction  supervision, \nenvironmental  supervision  and  monitoring,  resettlement \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  project  performance  monitoring, \nstudies, and capacity building. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  (i)  reduce  transport  time  and  costs,  thereby \nBeneficiaries  encouraging investment in the new city center, creating jobs, and \nincreasing incomes; (ii) improve the energy efficiency of public \ntransport and reduce carbon dioxide emissions; (iii) improve air \nquality by reducing emissions of major pollutants; (iv) help avoid \ntraffic  accidents;  and  (v)  improve  the  quality  of  urban  life  in \nLanzhou. \n \nLanzhou  consists  of  the  four  urban  districts  of  Anning, \nChengguan, Qilihe, and Xigu; one rural district; and three rural \ncounties.  Economic  activity  and  population  are  heavily \nconcentrated in the four urban districts, which occupy only 8.5% of \nthe city\u2019s land area but account for 62.9% of its population. \n \nBeneficiaries are not limited to Anning residents because (i) the \nnew city center will support the economic and social activities of \nLanzhou  residents  and  travelers from  outside  of  Lanzhou  and \n(ii) the development of the new city center will mitigate the overly \nintensive use of the current city center in Chengguan and Qilihe.  \n \n ", "iv \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  following  risks  could  affect  the  timely  implementation, \neconomic  viability,  and  realization  of  Project  benefits: \n(i) inadequate BRT design, (ii) capacity lacking for operating and \nmanaging  BRT,  (iii)  cooperation  for  BRT  lacking  from  bus \noperators  and  other  authorities,  (iv)  delay  in  the  provision  of \ncounterpart  funding,  and  (v)  failure  to  provide  adequate \nassistance to people involuntarily resettled.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project \n(the Project). This will be the first support for bus rapid transit (BRT) in the PRC of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). BRT is an efficient public transport system that will provide major \nbenefits for passengers and bus operators and will reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse \ngas  (GHG)  emissions.  The  Project  is  part  of  ADB's  initiative  to  support  greener,  more \nsustainable transport in the PRC and includes support for an application to use the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. The main features of the proposed \nProject are summarized in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The PRC has experienced significant economic progress. Rapid industrialization and \nurbanization have seen the PRC economy grow very quickly, averaging more than 9% annually \nsince 1978 and over 10% annually from 2001 to 2008. Gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 \nwas CNY30.07 trillion ($4.40 trillion), 83 times the GDP of CNY362.4 billion ($53.08 billion) \n3  decades earlier in 1978. Per capita GDP in 2008 was CNY22,698 ($3,324).  \n \n3.  The  development  of  transport  infrastructure,  including  expressways  and  other  road \nnetworks, has played a significant role in enabling sustained economic growth, which has \nsubstantially increased demand for transport. By the end of 2008, the PRC had a road network \nof 3.73 million kilometers (km), including 60,300 km of expressways, 54,200 km of class I \nhighways, 285,200 km of class II highways, 2.38 million km of class III and class IV highways, \nand 951,600 km of rural and other roads. By 2008, road transport accounted for 54.1% of total \npassenger-km travelled and 12.3% of freight traffic in ton-km, compared with 33.3% and 23.8% \nfor rail and 0.3% and 61.8% for waterways. \n \n4.  With increases in per capita incomes, as well as reduced customs duties on vehicles \nfollowing PRC accession to the World Trade Organization, the number of registered vehicles \nincreased from about 1 million in the early 1990s to 43.58 million in 2008. Over the past 5 years, \nthe number of registered vehicles has increased at an average annual rate of 16.3%. Vehicle \nownership reached 33 vehicles per 1,000 people nationwide in 2008. It is expected to continue \nto increase rapidly, considering that vehicle ownership per 1,000 people is generally in the \nrange of 300\u2013800 in industrialized countries. Vehicles bring enormous benefits to the economy \nand users by enhancing mobility. Rapidly growing demand, especially for private vehicles, is a \nmanifestation of the mobility benefits. However, associated with these benefits are the emerging \nproblems  of  traffic  congestion,  road  accidents,  air  pollution,  and  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) \nemissions that cause widespread concern. \n \n5.  Urban areas in the PRC have grown rapidly since the 1980s and now contribute 80% of \nGDP. To increase personal income and achieve a better quality of life, many people have \nmoved from the countryside to the cities. Some 300\u2013400 million people migrated in a single \ngeneration. The PRC\u2019s urban population accounted for 44.9% of the national population in 2007 \nand is expected to reach 47.0% by 2010. Rapid economic growth and rural\u2013urban migration \nhave changed the structure of urban transport. Suburban areas have developed around many \ncities for new residents. This has made it more difficult for people to rely on biking and walking \nand thereby increased the need for public transport. As vehicle ownership trends indicate, there \n ", "2   \nhas been a continuing shift toward using private vehicles for urban transport, but this trend is not \nsustainable because of the congestion it causes and the resulting deterioration in the quality of \nservice and efficiency of both private and public transport.  \n \n6.  Rapid motorization has allowed municipal governments little time to prepare strategically \neffective responses or build institutional capacity for urban transport. They have responded to \ndemand for more road space by investing heavily in road capacity and, in most cities, adopted \npiece-meal and stop-gap measures. The main solution to complex urban transport problems lies \nin developing efficient and affordable public transport systems, together with effective pricing \nand  other  policies  to  manage  demand  for  private  vehicles.  It  is  becoming  clearer  to  the \nGovernment of the PRC (the Government) that increasing the capacity and efficiency of public \ntransport would contribute greatly to sustainable development. \n \n7.  The PRC has become the world\u2019s second-largest oil consumer, having gone from being \na net exporter of crude oil to importing a third of its fuel. The PRC contributed more than 40% of \nthe  increase  in  global  demand  for  primary  energy  between  2000  and  2006.  Despite  low \nemissions per capita, it became the world\u2019s largest national GHG emitter in 2006, and its GHG \nemissions are increasing rapidly as the economy continues to grow. Its total GHG emissions are \nprojected to rise by 65\u201380% over the 15 years from 2006 to 2020.  \n \n8.  Road transport is a significant and increasingly important contributor to PRC emissions \nof GHG. The transport sector currently accounts for 8% of energy consumption in the PRC, but \nthis is projected to increase to 15% by 2030. Petroleum consumption was 10 million tons in \n2005, with vehicles accounting for 30%. By 2020, when the number of registered vehicles is \nprojected to reach 170 million, petroleum consumption is projected to reach 100 million tons, \nwith vehicles accounting for 57%. Road GHG emissions are expected to increase by the same \nproportion. Burning 100 million tons of petroleum will emit 320 million tons of GHG. \n \n9.  Under  the  PRC\u2019s  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (11FYP,  2006\u20132010),  the  Government \nprioritizes  inclusive  and  balanced  regional  development,  resource  optimization,  and \nenvironmental  protection  through  policy  reform,  increased  investment,  and  improved \ninfrastructure management. The resource optimization targets of the 11FYP in the transport \nsector include 20% reductions in (i) land utilization per 100 million vehicle-km, (ii) vehicle and \nship energy consumption per ton-km, and (iii) emissions of major pollutants. Meeting the 11FYP \ntargets  requires  sustainable,  harmonious,  and  environmentally  friendly  development  in  the \ntransport sector.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n \n1.  Challenges and Opportunities \n \n10.  Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province, is a regional hub between the eastern and \nwestern regions of the PRC. Home to 3.1 million inhabitants, it is the economic, political, and \ncultural center of Gansu. The population density of Lanzhou is 252 people per square kilometer \n(km2), more than 4 times that of Gansu. The main city is located on the banks of the Yellow \nRiver and contained within a narrow east\u2013west valley with steep terrain at both the north and \nsouth that effectively constrains further expansion of the city. The urban area stretches for \nalmost 40 km along the river from west to east but extends only 8 km from north to south and, at \nits narrowest point, is less than 1 km wide.  \n \n11.  The city has four distinct development zones. Three\u2014Xigu, Qilihe, and Chengguan\u2014are \nat the site of the original city on the south bank of the Yellow River and are still the centers of \nbusiness, commerce, and government. The fourth zone is on the north bank of the river at \n ", "3 \nAnning, a residential area that is also a center for education, including universities. Economic \nactivity and population are heavily concentrated in the four urban districts, which occupy only \n8.5% of Lanzhou\u2019s land area but account for 62.9% of its population and 80.2% of its gross \nregional product. There is limited potential for further growth of the city along the south bank. In \nChengguan, in particular, population density has reached 18,000/km2, bringing considerable \ncongestion and pollution. There is good potential for developing the city in Anning, where 80% \nof the land is suitable for settlement and the population density of only 3,400/km2. \n \n12.  Future urban development will therefore require a second city center to be developed at \nAnning. To realize this opportunity, the Lanzhou municipal government (LMG) has adopted a \nstrategy of \"one river, two centers, seven groups\" as the key concept of its urban master plan to \noptimize land use and the economic and social functions of the city. In support of this plan, the \nmunicipal government will relocate its offices from Chengguan district to the new center in \nAnning. As Anning will become the new political, administrative, economic, and cultural center \nof the city, there will be a significant increase in the demand for transport to, from, and within \nAnning. \n \n13.  The Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project will contribute to realizing the urban \nmaster plan by supporting the development of the urban road network and mass transport \nsystem serving the new city center. The component roads included in the Project have been \nselected by LMG and proposed to ADB to provide improved access and connectivity between \nthe  business,  industrial,  and  education  centers  of  the  new  city  center  and  the  municipal \nadministrative district. \n \n  2.  Development Coordination \n \n14.  In  the  road  subsector,  the  World  Bank  (WB)  and  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) have been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national and local road \nnetworks. The WB has provided loans of about $9.4 billion to finance road investments and the \nJICA (provided by Japan Bank for International Cooperation) has provided about \u00a5195.0 billion \nfor  this  purpose.  The  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD) provided cofinancing in the amount of Euro 85 million for road projects in \nthe southwestern region of the PRC. ADB coordinates with these development partners to \ndiscuss progress and issues in the sector. ADB has met regularly with the WB for coordination \nand information sharing. The Government coordinates the activities of different development \npartners and has utilized ADB TA support for researching and influencing a number of policy \ninterventions. ADB has coordinated closely with other development partners on policy dialogue \nand shared its development experiences with them. A summary of development coordination to \nthe road sector is in Appendix 2. \n \n  3.  Policy Dialogue \n \n15.  The Project will be ADB's first project to support urban mass transport in the PRC, though \nADB has previously provided technical assistance.1 During loan processing, the policy dialogue \non sustainable urban transport helped LMG to refine its approach to transportation in the \nLanzhou City Urban Master Plan, notably by incorporating BRT, advanced traffic management, \ninformation technology, and an application to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the \nKyoto Protocol. The Project is part of ADB's initiative to support greener transport in the PRC.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 1995. China Urban Transport Symposium jointly sponsored with the PRC's Ministry of Finance, the Ministry \nof Construction, and the World Bank. Manila; and ADB. 1996. Beijing Urban Transport. Manila. The China Urban \nTransport Symposium emphasized the importance of supporting public transport and non-motorized transport and \ncontrolling the use of private cars in cities.  \n ", "4   \n \na.  Public Transport \n16.  From 2005 to 2020, demand for public transport in Lanzhou is expected to grow by \n2.1 times, the number of registered passenger vehicles by 6.8 times, and the number of buses \nby 1.9 times. The forecasted traffic demand is higher in Anning than in other areas of Lanzhou \nbecause of the development of the new city center. For example, traffic demand in Anning is \nexpected to grow by 2.8 times from 2008 to 2020 (Appendix 3).  \n \n17.  Improved urban mass transport will play a critical role in the development of the new city \ncenter. Recent rapid increases in passenger vehicle ownership and the rapid decline of non-\nmotorized  transport  (NMT)  are  causing  congestion  and  adverse  environmental  impacts  in \nLanzhou. A good-quality, high-capacity public transport system is needed to support high-\ndensity urban development, reduce the land needed for transport, and enable transit-oriented \ndevelopment. Public transport generally has much larger passenger carrying capacity than \nprivate vehicles, for much lower energy use and carbon dioxide (CO ) emission per passenger \n2\ntrip. For example, the average CO  emissions per person-km from a bus is 25 grams (g), only \n2\none sixth the 150 g of a private vehicle. \n \n18.  Public transport helps avoid the vicious spiral of road investment accompanied by ever-\nincreasing numbers of private motor vehicles and worsening congestion. BRT offers a cost-\neffective, flexible, and environmentally friendly mass transit option for meeting the city's growing \ndemand for urban transport. BRT uses buses in segregated lanes to provide a higher quality of \npublic transport service than can ordinary buses in mixed traffic in terms of passengers per \nhour,  passenger  comfort,  station  quality,  operational  speed,  and  other  parameters.  BRT \nsystems have generally been well received by users. Following policy dialogue during project \nprocessing, LMG decided to introduce BRT on the main corridor in Anning. \n \n19.  As part of the PRC's macroeconomic stimulus package, LMG recently began preparing \nan initial project proposal for a Lanzhou light rail transit (LRT) system in March 2009. If built, the \nLRT  would  serve  other  parts  of  Lanzhou  and  complement  BRT  serving  Anning.  The  two \nsystems would be closely integrated to maximize service efficiency and convenience for users. \n \nb.  Climate Change  \n20.  The international scientific community, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, has reached consensus that the earth is getting warmer. GHG emissions from human \nactivities has been found to be a significant contributor to this change. A 1\u00b0C rise in average \nglobal temperatures is expected to have the following consequences: (i) water supplies for 50 \nmillion people will be threatened; (ii) 0.3 million deaths will occur from climate-related diseases, \nmalaria, diarrhea, and malnutrition; (iii) at least 10% of land species will face extinction; and \n(iv)  Atlantic thermohaline circulation will start to weaken. Scientists warn that, depending on the \nglobal GHG emission scenario, the world's average temperature is expected to rise between \n1.8\u00b0C  and  4\u00b0C  by  the  end  of  this  century.  In  its  National  Climate  Change  Program,  the \nGovernment highlights particular sectors and areas in the country vulnerable to climate change. \nThese include, but are not limited to, agriculture and livestock, forest and natural ecosystems, \nwater resources, and coastal zones. In addition, it anticipates nationwide impacts such as the \nspread of disease. \n \n21.  Transport accounts for 14% of global CO  emissions. CO  emissions are expected to \n2 2\ngrow in tandem with energy consumption over the next 40 years. To help address the growth in \n ", "5 \nGHG emissions from developing countries, the Kyoto Protocol established the CDM,2 which \noffers further incentive for promoting low-carbon alternatives, including public transport projects, \nby selling certified emission reductions, or carbon credits, to developed countries. \n \nc.  Application of Information Technology \n22.  In many businesses and governments around the world, the construction and operation \nof transportation systems is being transformed by computers, sensors, and communications \ntechnology\u2014collectively  called  information  technology.  Information  technology  applied  to \nsurface transportation creates an intelligent transport system (ITS). An ITS provides the ability \nto gather, organize, analyze, use, and share information about transportation systems. It also \nprovides  vital  support  for  operating  transportation  systems,  including  traffic  management, \noversight of system maintenance, and more effectively and reliably managing public transport. \nThe support provided by an ITS helps increase the capacity of existing road infrastructure, the \nefficiency of road transport, and the quality of transport services. \n \n23.  The Ministry of Transport started researching and developing an ITS in the 1990s and \ndeveloped  the  ITS  strategic  program.  In  the  11FYP,  the  Government  stated  that  it  would \ncontinue with ITS deployment to improve transport services, infrastructure management, and \nnational  economic  development.  In  response  to  urban  transport  issues  and  the  emerging \ndemand for road transport, LMG wishes to increase the capacity and efficiency of road transport \nby utilizing an ITS.  \n \n24.  Innovative use of information technology, such as thorough advanced signal systems, \nadvanced traveler information systems, and intelligent bus stop systems, can help increase the \ncapacity of infrastructure in Anning by managing traffic flow and mitigating traffic congestion, \nroad accidents, air pollution, urban poverty, and climate change.  \n \nd.  Non-Motorized Transport  \n \n25.  Strengthening NMT is a sustainable approach to urban transport. Bicycles and walking \nminimize private vehicle traffic and advance the greening of urban transport. A socioeconomic \nsurvey conducted during project preparation indicated that, in Anning, walking constitutes 56% \nof person trips and bicycles 22%. However, by 2020 these rates are projected to decline to 44% \nand 16%, respectively, without the Project, as motor vehicles progressively dominate the roads \nand as trip distances grow in line with the city's expansion. The major issues for NMT are that \n(i)  many junction designs and roadway designs are not optimal for pedestrian and cyclist safety; \n(ii) a network of protected or separated bicycle lanes has not been developed and some NMT \nlanes have been captured by vehicles for driving and parking; and (iii) bicycle parking facilities \nat key locations such as bus stations, shopping centers, and public facilities are insufficient. \n \n26.  Despite rapid growth in private vehicle ownership, most urban households are without \nvehicles and likely to remain so for the next 10\u201315 years. Their mobility needs have been \nunderserved by the prevailing emphasis on trying to accommodate private vehicle use, which \nerodes the convenience and safety of NMT. There are conflicts between the PRC's objective \n                                                \n2  The CDM under the Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce GHG emissions cost effectively by financing low-carbon \nprojects in developing countries, where costs may be lower than in industrialized countries. The CDM is supervised \nby the CDM executive board (CDM EB) under the guidance of the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change. Once projects are registered by the CDM EB, project entities can implement the project and \nmonitor emission reductions, which must be verified and certified by a third party. Once the CDM EB issues the \ncertified emission reductions (CERs) to project participants, they can sell them to receive additional revenue. In \nsome cases, project entities can receive upfront payment for the future delivery of CERs. However, in these cases \nprices tend to be heavily discounted and bank guarantees may be sought to counter the risk of nondelivery. \n ", "6   \nthat all families will eventually have access to a private vehicle, the associated objective of \nexpanding the urban road network, and the need to establish sustainable approaches to urban \ntransport. It is becoming clearer to LMG that road expansion alone does not adequately answer \nmotorization and traffic congestion and that, in addition to improving public transport, NMT has a \nrole to play in urban transport and making the city more livable. \n \ne.  Traffic Demand Management (Demand-Side Policy) \n \n27.  In  addition  to  supply-side  measures  such  as  the  provision  of  road  infrastructure, \ndemand-side policy measures to limit the use of private vehicles are required to avoid traffic \ncongestion problems. Many large cities have shown that supply-side expansion can quickly \ncause severe traffic congestion when not accompanied by sufficient measures to make the use \nof  private  vehicles  relatively  less  attractive.  In  addition  to  restricting  private  vehicle  use, \ndemand-side measures such as traffic demand management (TDM) have good potential to \ncreate an additional revenue stream to help finance public transport improvements. One of the \nsimplest approaches is to charge a relatively high fee for parking in city centers, thereby making \ncar use less attractive than public transport. Singapore and London are among the cities that \nhave  demonstrated  various  other  regulatory  and  demand-side  measures  to  limit  vehicle \nnumbers and reduce demand for vehicle use in congested city centers. \n \n  4.  Lesson Learned  \n \n28.  Urban  transport  strategy  and  policy  need  to  combine  urban  transport  infrastructure \ninvestment with proactive interventions to improve public transport and introduce TDM. The \ncombined transport strategy and policy may include BRT or priority public transport schemes, \nrestraints on car traffic in congested areas or at certain times of day, and congestion pricing for \nroad use. \n \n29.  Several BRT systems already operating in the PRC have a number of weaknesses \nattributable to planning and design deficiencies. Lessons from these BRTs include the following: \n(i)  Physical  design  should  take  into  account  operational  design  and  demand \ncharacteristics. \n(ii)  Bus  stations  should  not  be  located  near  intersections,  as  this  often  causes \nvehicles to block intersections and pedestrian crossings. \n(iii)  Stations should be designed to meet current and future demand, which may \nrequire leaving space for future station expansion. \n(iv)  Station design should address issues of peak demand to avoid long queues at \nticket windows. \n(v)  As stations should vary in size depending on demand, it is important that the \nBRT be designed by specialists with experience in BRT design. \n(vi)  As the goal of BRT is to save time and operational costs for all road users, BRT \ndesign and planning should proceed on this basis. \n(vii)  Operational design should ensure that a large majority of bus passengers along \nthe BRT corridor are carried on BRT buses in the BRT system. \n(viii)  Specialized  high-capacity  BRT  vehicles  should  be  considered,  as  they  can \nimprove the quality of service and efficiency of energy use. \n(ix)  Operation planning should be conducted to identify BRT station and operational \nrequirements and determine whether an operational subsidy is needed. \n(x)  Well  before  implementation,  a  BRT  agency  or  dedicated  team  should  be \nestablished  to  take  responsibility  for  project  implementation  and  the  initial \noperation of the system. \n \n ", "7 \n30.  ADB has financed several transport and urban projects in Gansu.3 These projects have \nhelped  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Gansu  provincial  government  (GPG)  in  project \nimplementation. The GPG has transferred knowledge and experience to LMG to support project \npreparation and implementation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  The impact of the Project will be sustainable economic growth, effective environmental \nimprovement, poverty reduction, and inclusive social development in Lanzhou (Appendix 1). \nThe outcome will be an efficient, safe, and clean urban road transport system in Lanzhou. The \nProject will (i)  generate certified emission reductions, (ii) increase average bus speed along the \nBRT corridor, (iii)  increase the share of public transport, (iv) shorten average travel time, and \n(v) decrease the accident rates of vehicles and NMT. \n \nB.  Outputs \n32.  The  Project  will  focus  on  providing  sustainable  urban  transport.  It  will  have  four \ncomponents under ADB financing in Lanzhou's Anning and Qilihe districts: (i) the construction \nand reconstruction of 33.8 km of urban roads including BRT facilities and NMT lanes (Appendix \n4);  (ii)   advanced  traffic  management;  (iii)  an  advanced  environmental  monitoring  system, \nincluding air quality sensors; and (iv) capacity building. The construction and reconstruction of \nurban roads will comprise 21.4 km of new road construction and 12.4 km of reconstruction of \nexisting roads. Some 13.0 km of BRT lanes and 22 BRT stations will be constructed in the \nmiddle of the road sections. All constructed and reconstructed urban roads except 1.7 km of \nS578 will have NMT lanes 3.5\u20135.0 meters wide between sidewalks and carriage ways, providing \ndedicated access for bicycles. The advanced traffic management component will comprise (i) an \nadvanced traffic control system (signal control), (ii) TDM strategy and policy reform, and (iii) a \nNMT  development  plan.  The  advanced  environmental  monitoring  system  will  consist  of \nmonitoring stations and a data-processing center that will monitor such air pollutants as nitrogen \ndioxide, sulfur dioxide, and suspended particulate matter.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n33.  The  issue  of  the  sustainability  of  urban  transport  systems  is  receiving  increasing \nattention as a matter of public policy at all levels of government and among international \ndevelopment partners and nongovernment organizations. It is the core organizing concept of the \nProject. A sustainable urban transport system is one that emphasizes efficient travel patterns \nand behavior using public transport and NMT, while discouraging inefficient ones such as the \nuse of private vehicles. Inefficient travel patterns need to be reduced to minimize resource \nconsumption  and  environmental  effects.  The  special  features  of  the  Project  will  support \nsustainable  urban  transport  and  enhance  mobility,  health,  and  economic  development \nopportunities for local residents.  \n \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2004.

Manila (Loan 2407\u2013PRC). \n ", "8   \n34.  Bus Rapid Transit. By introducing BRT in Lanzhou, the Project will provide a cost-\neffective and flexible form of mass transport. BRT systems typically cost less than 10% of the \ncost of underground metros and can be planned, designed, and implemented much more \nquickly. Fares of underground metros are typically three to four times those of BRT. \n \n35.  The proposed BRT was designed after careful study of demand and BRT infrastructure \nand operational requirements (Appendix 5). BRT will be constructed mainly in the new city \ncenter in Anning, but the BRT corridor will cross the Yellow River and connect with the current \ncity center. To improve the quality of service, BRT will include an intelligent bus stop system at \nBRT stations that uses global positioning system units on buses and an associated information \nsystem on next bus arrival. The design of BRT stations will allow for future increases in capacity, \nand space for bicycle parking will be provided at all BRT stations to support NMT.  \n \n36.  There are two main types of BRT operating systems: (i) a closed system in which BRT \nbuses operate only inside the BRT corridor and (ii) a flexible system in which selected BRT \nroutes operate both inside and beyond the BRT corridor, making allowance for both existing \nbuses and specialized BRT buses. The proposed BRT will use the flexible system, whose main \nadvantages are (i) removing the need to build interchanges and transfer terminals, (ii) a greatly \nreduced the number of passenger transfers, and (iii) enabling the use of existing vehicles.  \n \n37.  If the proposed LRT is eventually built,4 the LRT and the BRT will be closely integrated. \nThe BRT will serve shorter-haul passengers in the vicinity of Anning, while the LRT serves \nlonger-haul passengers, mainly in other parts of Lanzhou.  \n \n38.  Greenhouse  Gas  Emission  Reduction  and  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism. \nHigh demand for transport and associated traffic congestion make urban areas major sources of \nCO  emissions in the PRC. Urban transport projects need to directly address the challenges of \n2\nenergy consumption and emissions. BRT will improve current public transport systems and \nreduce the energy consumption and CO  emissions needed to meet the current demand for \n2\npublic transport and additional demand generated as passengers are diverted from private \nvehicles and by future economic growth. As one important driving force of the Project, GHG \nemission reduction has been considered an indicator for the optimization of urban transport \nsystem planning in Lanzhou. \n \n39.  BRT will help to mitigate climate change by reducing GHG emissions via (i) improved \nfuel-use efficiency through the use of new and larger buses, (ii)  mode switching with the \navailability of an efficient and attractive public transport system, (iii) load increasing by having a \ncoordinated  system  for  dispatching  buses,  and  (iv)  buses\u2019  increased  average  speed.  The \nProject is therefore consistent with the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC) and potentially eligible for gain carbon credits under the CDM. \nLMG  has  requested  ADB  support  in  preparing  its  application  to  the  CDM  for  the  BRT \ncomponent  of  the  Project.5 Preparing  a  CDM  application  can  be  complex  and  requires \nsubstantial data and documentation. Globally, only one BRT system has so far been registered \nfor the CDM. ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative will provide integrated technical support to LMG for \nthe CDM application, as outlined in Appendix 6. The Project will also support building the \ncapacity of LMG in resource optimization in the transport sector to enhance the city\u2019s energy \nefficiency and help it maintain a small carbon footprint. \n \n                                                \n4  Although Lanzhou does not qualify under the minimum national standards for constructing an LRT line, LMG began \npreparing an initial project proposal for an LRT system in March 2009. Very high cost makes it uncertain that the \nLRT proposal will be approved.  \n5  As part of project preparation, ADB arranged a workshop on climate change and the CDM in Lanzhou on 15\u201316 \nNovember 2008.  \n ", "9 \n40.  If approved for the CDM, the BRT component of the Project will generate about 5,000 \ncertified reductions6 of GHG  emissions  annually.  The  prices for these  carbon  credits  vary \ndepending on market conditions, but at $10 per credit, for example, the Project could generate \nadditional revenue of $50,000 per year. Carbon credits may provide LMG with additional income \nto contribute to the cost of maintaining and operating BRT. While the current CDM under the \nKyoto Protocol will terminate by 2012, a post-2012 CDM-like framework has been discussed at \nthe Conference of the Parties and Meeting of the Parties of the UNFCCC, though a final \narrangement has yet to be decided. Existing and potential voluntary markets for CO  reductions \n2\ncould help sustain the development of GHG-mitigating projects. The Future Carbon Fund, an \nintegral part of ADB's Carbon Market Initiative, seeks to further stimulate investments in GHG-\nmitigating projects by enabling project developers to gain benefits beyond 2012. ADB is the \ntrustee of the Future Carbon Fund. Any investments by the Future Carbon Fund are subject to \napproval by the Fund Board, which consists of public and private sector participants. The \nProject will support finding an opportunity to utilize the Future Carbon Fund. \n \n41.  Advanced  Traffic  Control  System  (Signal  Control).  The  Project  will  introduce \nadvanced  technology  to  replace  obsolete  signal  equipment  and  significantly  expand  the \ngeographic coverage of active traffic control on new and reconstructed roads. This will support \nvideo and other monitoring systems for stoplight violations, traffic lane adherence, license plate \nidentification,  speed  detection,  and  variable  message  signing.  The  data  collected  by  the \nadvanced  traffic  control  system  will  be  shared  for  road  maintenance,  road  and  transport \nplanning, and environmental and CDM monitoring. \n \n42.  Traffic  Demand  Management  Strategy  and  Policy  Reform. TDM addresses traffic \ncongestion by reducing or optimizing demand for transport and influencing user behavior at \nvarious  levels.  The  Project  will  streamline  TDM  concepts  and  strategy  in  Lanzhou  and \n(i) develop a TDM strategy including recommendations, action plans, and guidelines, which will \nenable  LMG  to  build  capacity  for  implementing  TDM  and  incorporate  TDM  concepts  and \nstrategy into future city planning; (ii) reform on a pilot basis the current policy on pricing public \nparking by introducing a demand-based pricing system; (iii) develop the concept of pilot traffic-\ncalming  zones  to  restrict  high-speed  driving,  through  traffic,  and  truck  traffic  with  traffic \nregulations and physical barriers; and (iv) advise on the institutional coordination of TDM issues \nwithin LMG (Appendix 7). \n \n43.  Non-Motorized  Transport  Development  Plan.  Another  important  requirement  for \nAnning\u2019s becoming a sustainable and livable city center is to provide for NMT with bicycle \nroutes, pedestrian sidewalks, and crossings. NMT is an essential element of sustainable urban \ntransport. The Project will incorporate the provision of 32.1 km of NMT lanes and bicycle parking \nfacilities in the new city center. It will support the creation of a NMT development plan for \nLanzhou,  including  an  NMT  development  framework  and  recommendations.  The  NMT \ndevelopment framework will prepare (i) a financing framework for NMT interventions, (ii) the \nintroduction of transit-oriented development, (iii) an incentive scheme for shopkeepers and \nemployers  to  support  NMT,  (iv)  engineering  normative  designs  for  road  networks,  and \n(v)  campaigns to promote NMT safety. The recommendations to be developed will support \nimproved NMT design, improved NMT network and connectivity to other transport modes, the \nenforcement of traffic regulation for the effective use of NMT lanes, and a reduction in accidents \ninvolving pedestrians and cyclists (Appendix 7). \n \n                                                \n6  The volume of certified emission reductions (CERs) has been only preliminarily estimated for lack of data and is \nsubject to change. The CDM project design document, the application document for the CDM that contains the final \nCER calculation, is expected to be completed in early 2010, after obtaining results from the baseline survey as well \nas the detailed design of the proposed BRT system. \n ", "10  \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n44.  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $480.27 million, including taxes and \nduties of $21.42 million (Table 1). \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n45.  The Government of the PRC has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate\u2013based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreement. The Borrower has \ninformed ADB that interest during implementation and commitment charges will be paid by \nLMG. The Government will provide ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate\u2013based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB at loan negotiation.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem            Amounta \nA.

GPG will then \nmake the loan proceeds available to LMG on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan, with LMG bearing the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks of the ADB \nloan. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management  \n48.  LMG will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. LMG has established a project \nsteering committee (PSC).7 The deputy mayor of Lanzhou will chair PSC meetings every 3 \nmonths, or more often if necessary, to review implementation, resolve coordination issues, and \nprovide guidance for the timely completion of the Project. LMG has established and staffed a \nproject  management  office  (PMO).  The  PMO  will  coordinate  (i)  project  management; \n(ii)  supervise the procurement of works, goods, and services financed under the Project;8 \n(iii)   monitor  the  utilization  of  the  ADB  loan,  domestic  bank  funding;  and  (iv)  Government \nfunding; and prepare and review the reports to be submitted to ADB and the Government. LMG \nhas appointed a project manager for the day-to-day management of project implementation \n(Appendix 9). \n \n49.  After project completion, project facilities will be transferred to the relevant government \nentities for operation and management: roads, bridges, and utilities to the Anning and Qilihe \ndistrict urban infrastructure management stations; the advanced traffic control system to the \nLanzhou Municipal Traffic Police Brigade; BRT stations and ticketing machines to the Lanzhou \nPublic Transport Group (LPTG); platforms of the BRT stations and BRT lanes to the Anning \ndistrict urban infrastructure management station; street lights to the street lightning management \nsection; and the advanced environmental monitoring system to the Anning district environmental \nprotection bureau.  \n \n                                                \n7  The PSC consists of representatives from the city agencies with responsibility for implementing the Project, \nincluding the Lanzhou Development and Reform Commission, Lanzhou Municipal Financial Bureau, Lanzhou \nMunicipal Planning Bureau, Lanzhou Municipal Construction Commission, Lanzhou Municipal Land Resources \nBureau, Lanzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, Lanzhou Municipal Traffic Police Brigade, Lanzhou Municipal \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau,  Lanzhou  Public  Transport  Group,  Lanzhou  Urban  Investment  Company, \nLanzhou Municipal Economic and Technical Zone, and Lanzhou Municipal Foreign Loan Utilization Office, which \nwas established under the Lanzhou Development and Reform Committee. \n8  Under the supervision of the Gansu Bidding Office. \n ", "12  \n2.  Implementation Period \n50.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from 2009 to 2014. The implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n51.  All procurement of goods and works financed by the ADB loan will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts for goods estimated at $1.0 million or more and contracts for works estimated at \n$10.0 million or more will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. \nContracts for goods estimated at $200,000 or more but less than the above-mentioned ICB \nvalue,  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  at  $200,000  or  more  but  less  than  the  above-\nmentioned  ICB  value,  will  be  procured  by  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in \naccordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), subject to modifications agreed \nwith ADB. The procurement plan is in Appendix 11. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n52.  ADB will finance 22 person-months of international consulting services and 65 person-\nmonths of national for (i) reforming TDM strategy and policy, (ii) planning BRT operation and \nmanagement,  (iii)  planning  NMT  development,  (iv)  reviewing  BRT  detailed  design,  and \n(v) building capacity for BRT operation and management. The consultants to be financed under \nthe ADB loan will be selected and engaged based on a simplified technical proposal using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method9 and using the individual consultant selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). The Government will engage and finance international consultants (10 person-months) \nand national consultants (2,493 person-months) for detailed engineering design, construction \nsupervision, environmental supervision and monitoring, resettlement monitoring and evaluation, \nproject performance monitoring, studies, and capacity building. The international and national \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n5.  Advanced Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n53.  LMG requested ADB's approval of advanced contracting for three civil works packages \ncovering  four  road  sections  and  for  international  and  national  consulting  services  for  the \nsupervision of the detailed design of the BRT system, including overseas and domestic training. \nThe request will significantly expedite project implementation, enable the timely commencement \nof civil works, and ensure appropriate BRT design. Advanced contracting for civil works and \ninternational  and  national  consulting  services  for  reviewing  the  BRT  detailed  design  was \napproved on 4 June 2009. This will include bidding, bid evaluation, posting the consultant \nrecruitment notice, short-listing, and requesting and evaluating proposals. Advanced contracting \nwill be undertaken in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. Retroactive financing will not exceed 20% of the total ADB loan, or $30 \nmillion for eligible expenditures, including three civil works contract packages for four road \nsections, international and national consulting services, and overseas and domestic training that \nwill be directly administered by LMG. Costs for retroactive financing should be incurred before \nloan effectiveness but not more than 12 months before the Loan Agreement is signed. The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. It was agreed that national competitive \n                                                \n9  The quality:cost ratio is 80:20. \n ", "13 \nbidding procedures will be used for procuring civil works for the three contract packages under \nretroactive financing.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n54.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, GPG, and LMG. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n55.  The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payments and commitment procedures will be \nused for large contracts. If Government funds are used first for eligible expenditures, ADB\u2019s \nreimbursement procedure will be followed. To facilitate disbursements, the Gansu Provincial \nFinance  Department  will  establish,  after  loan  effectiveness,  an  imprest  account  with  a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account ceiling will not exceed the estimated \nexpenditure to be financed from the imprest account for the next 6 months or 10% of the ADB \nloan amount, whichever is lower. To expedite the flow of funds, the statement of expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse,  liquidate,  or  replenish  eligible  expenditures  for  any \nindividual payment not exceeding $200,000 equivalent. The financial management assessment \nfound the PMO to have the capacity to administer arrangements to disburse project finances.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  The  PMO  will  prepare  semiannual  progress  reports  indicating  (i)  progress  made, \n(ii) problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  (iii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to \nremedy the problems, (iv) the proposed program of activities, and (v) progress expected in the \nnext 6 months. LMG will maintain separate accounts for the Project and have such accounts \nand related financial statements audited annually by an independent auditor and in accordance \nwith auditing standards that are acceptable to ADB. LMG is required to submit to ADB within 6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year certified copies of such audited project accounts and \nfinancial statements and auditor's reports, all in English. The audit of such financial statements \nwill include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with \nrespect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, (ii) a separate opinion on the \nuse of imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedure, and (iii) an assessment of \ncompliance with loan covenants that may be agreed under the Project and ADB's requirements \non project management. An internal audit unit has been established in LMG to ensure that an \neffective internal control system and a mechanism of checks and balances are put in place. The \nunit will independently test PMO financial transactions to ensure the safe custody of project-\nfinanced  assets  and  report  directly  to  LMG  and  external  auditors.  The  PMO  will  make \nsatisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of the project implementation by submitting \nto ADB quarterly progress reports and, within 3 months of the end of the Project, a completion \nreport. \n \n ", "14  \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n57.  The PMO has concurred with the proposed set of monitoring indicators for the project \nperformance monitoring system in the Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework. The design \nand monitoring framework includes key indicators that relate to project impacts, outcomes, and \noutputs. The PMO will hire qualified national consultants for monitoring and evaluating project \nperformance, establishing the monitoring and evaluation system, and training staff of the PMO \nin its use. The consultants will measure the indicators and report their findings to ADB upon \nproject inception, midterm, completion, and, compared with the baseline, annually for 3 years \nafter completion. About 11 person-months of national consultants' services are required to \nconduct field surveys, collect and analyze the data, and prepare reports. \n \n10.  Project Review \n58.  ADB will carry out review missions during project implementation. After the Project is \ndeclared effective, an inception mission will be fielded to finalize the project administration \nmemorandum and secure ADB and Government agreement on it. In the project administration \nmemorandum,  detailed  procedures  for  project  implementation  will  be  described,  including \nexplanations of major covenants, procurement, disbursement, reporting, and safeguards. ADB \nwill carry out annual review missions to confirm project implementation status and discuss all \nproject-related issues with LMG. A midterm review mission will be fielded in the 3rd year of \nproject implementation, through which ADB will carry out a comprehensive review of the status \nof project implementation. The cost estimate, the project\u2019s economic viability, and resettlement \nprogress will be reviewed. If issues are identified during review missions, adequate corrective \nmeasures will be taken to ensure successful project implementation. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial and Operational Aspects \n59.  Financial Aspects. As the Project is not revenue earning, no financial internal rate of \nreturn can be calculated. The financial sustainability of the Project was evaluated as follows. \nAnnual maintenance will be required to maintain the project roads, with periodic maintenance \nevery 7 years. For the entire project road, the average annual cost of maintenance is anticipated \nto be $2.8 million, with $56.97 million for periodic maintenance every 7 years. The average \nannual cost of maintaining BRT facilities and other traffic-management equipment is anticipated \nto be $0.6 million. Through its Urban Infrastructure Management Division, LMG will provide the \nnecessary funds for maintaining project assets (Appendix 12). \n \n60.  Operational Aspects. BRT services will be provided by LPTG, which is wholly owned by \nLMG. LPTG operates extensive, reliable public transport services in Lanzhou. It possesses \n2,089 buses and operates 92 bus routes with a total route length of 1,076 km. All buses in \nLanzhou  have  been  converted  from  diesel  to  compressed  natural  gas,  which  is  more \nenvironmentally friendly. Compressed natural gas buses will be used in the BRT lanes. In 2000, \nLPTG started implementing a prepaid system with integrated circuit cards on selected routes. \nToday, all routes and buses are equipped with the integrated circuit card system. Some 1.5 \nmillion integrated circuit cards are currently issued, and 55% of bus fares are paid using them. \n \n61.  LPTG's average annual bus ridership increased by 11.7% from 2004 to 2008. Average \nannual revenue per bus increased from CNY132,650 in 2004 to CNY210,950 in 2008 (for an \nannual  increase  of  12.3%);  average  revenue  per  passenger  increased  from  CNY0.76  to \n ", "15 \nCNY0.81 (1.6% annually); and average annual passenger trips per employee increased from \n48,030 to 70,710 in 2008 (10.2% annually).  \n \n62.  The LPTG bus division consistently shows a net operating profit, ranging from CNY56.75 \nmillion in 2004 (22.3% of revenue) to CNY63.26 million in 2008 (15% of revenue). When \nadministrative overhead and other non-operating expenses are included, the bus division\u2019s \nprofitability has had mixed results, with 2004, 2005, and 2008 showing a net loss before tax and \n2006 and 2007 showing a profit. With the commencement of BRT services in 2013, the bus \ndivision\u2019s profit before tax is projected to increase to CNY85.1 million. There will be no need for \nLMG to subsidize LPTG bus operators, including those operating BRT, in view of their expected \nprofitability (Appendix 16). \n \nB.  Economic Aspects \n63.  The traffic forecast was prepared by Lanzhou Jiaotong University using a conventional \nfour-stage transport  model  with  a  12x12  zone  origin\u2013destination  trip  matrix.  The  university \nconducted the origin\u2013destination survey in 2001 to support the comprehensive Lanzhou Transport \nPlan. Transport planning software called TRANSCARD was used in the traffic demand analysis \nto simulate traffic flows in the base year, 2008, and for projections for 2013, 2015, 2020, and \n2025. Updated traffic data for the base year was obtained from traffic counts conducted in 2008. \nTraffic accident statistics and bus operation surveys were used in the analysis.  \n \n64.  The economic analysis compared the \u201cwithout project\u201d and \u201cwith project\u201d scenarios. The \ncosts  included  capital  costs  for  physical  networks  and  BRT  works,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, environmental control and monitoring, detailed engineering design, implementation \nsupervision,  and  physical  contingencies.  Annualized  recurring  costs  for  road  maintenance, \nenvironmental monitoring, and the opportunity cost of land were included in the analysis. The \nquantified network benefits included time savings for passengers and freight, vehicle operating \ncosts, and reduced traffic accidents and vehicle emissions. The economic internal rate of return \nunder the most likely traffic growth scenario is 17.02% with a net present value of CNY1.65 \nbillion using a discount rate of 12%. Sensitivity tests were performed to examine the effect of \nalternative traffic growth rates, likely cost overruns, likely benefit reductions, and combinations \nof contingencies. The test results indicate that project economic viability is robust. Moreover, the \nreview of benefit distribution among different income groups shows that public transport users, \npedestrians, and bicyclists will be the prime beneficiaries of the Project (Appendix 13). \n \nC.  Social Aspects  \n \n65.  The population of Anning district in 2007 was 225,859, of which 199,528 (88%) was \nurban. The GDP per capita of Anning is lower than the average for Lanzhou because it was not \na key urban development zone until very recently. The urban poverty rate in Anning district is \n5.5%,10 and the official rural poverty rate is 2.8%.11 Less than 5% of people in Anning own \nvehicles, and most rely on walking, bicycles, or buses. The project area has very few members \nof  ethnic  minorities,  and  they  will  not  be  significantly  affected  by  the  Project  or  its  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  Therefore,  the  Project  is  category  C  under  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n66.  The social and poverty analysis concluded that the Project will be very beneficial to \nmany stakeholders. Although the poverty rate in Anning is quite low, there are vulnerable \n                                                \n10 Based on average monthly income below CNY230 per capita. \n11 Based on average annual net income below CNY1,000 per capita. Using the international poverty line of $1.25 per \nday, the incidence of rural poverty in Anning would be about 10%. \n ", "16  \ngroups such as the disabled and elderly that have special needs for transport. The Project will \naddress transport and related social issues (e.g., accessibility, safety, and affordability) through \nthe improved design of transport infrastructure, operations, and services. Project design will \nemphasize improvements for pedestrians, bicycles, and bus transport, including BRT (e.g., \nsafer pedestrian crossings, speed controls, better NMT routes, and improved bus services). \nOther social measures will enhance benefits for local people, including farmers, women, the \nelderly, the disabled, and children. A social development action and monitoring plan (SDAMP) \nhas been formulated in consultation with key stakeholders and will be implemented by the PMO \nand other relevant agencies. Actions and monitoring measures that will target and/or involve \nwomen in their design and implementation have been included in the SDAMP (e.g., traffic safety \nawareness, livelihood training, pedestrian training, and adequate lighting on streets and at bus \nstops).  The  implementation  of  these  actions  will  ensure  that  (i)  development  benefits  are \ninclusive of women; children; and the elderly, disabled, and poor and that (ii) any adverse \nimpacts are identified and avoided or mitigated (Appendix 14). \n \n67.  There  was  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  and  participation  throughout  project \ndesign.  Household  surveys  and  group  discussions  were  conducted  for  people  affected  by \nresettlement, residents of the project area, and transportation users. Consultations were carried \nout with relevant local government agencies, All China Women\u2019s Federation, and Disabled \nPeople\u2019s Federation. Consultation will continue, and participation will be encouraged during the \nfinalization  of  project  design;  the  implementation  of  project  components;  and  resettlement, \nenvironment, and other social measures. Local communities will help monitor the SDAMP.  \n \nD.  Resettlement  \n \n68.  The Project will require significant resettlement, as 122 hectares (ha) of land will be \nacquired, including 49 ha of farmland, affecting 780  households. Also, 1,409 houses and 288 \nbusinesses will be demolished and relocated. The Project will adversely affect 8,000 people, \nnearly all of whom are rural residents or have recently registered for urban residence. As Anning \nis an urban district of Lanzhou, compensation standards for land acquisition and the relocation \npolicy for rural residents there are very reasonable and have gained the support of affected \nhouseholds.  Some  efforts  have  been  made  to  minimize  land  acquisition  by  considering \nalternative road designs, but the area has already been zoned for redevelopment so villagers \nwill eventually be relocated. The focus of resettlement planning has therefore been to integrate \naffected people into the new city development zone, where they will benefit from improved living \nconditions  and  higher  property  values.  Most  people  will  select  exchange  housing  in  four \nresettlement sites that will be constructed by the Anning district government. These sites will \nserve other future resettlement needs, as Anning continues implementing its urban master plan, \nwhich  will  ensure  better-quality  housing,  public  facilities,  social  amenities,  and  commercial \nopportunities. The impact on income is not significant for most affected households because \n(i)  the land lost is relatively small for the road sections and (ii) most of their income is already \nderived off the farm. Nonetheless, some seriously affected households and vulnerable people \nwill  receive  training,  employment  arrangements,  and/or  other  assistance  to  ensure  their \nlivelihoods  are  improved  and  sustainable.  The  resettlement  cost  is  $152.08  million.  The \nresettlement  plan  and  other  information  have  been  disclosed  to  affected  villages  and \nhouseholds. Land acquisition and resettlement cost will be financed by borrowing from the Bank \nof China and by LMG's own funds (Appendix 15).  \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n \n69.  ADB has classified the Project as environmental category A. The environmental impact \nassessment  (EIA)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) by the Gansu Environmental Science and Design \n ", "17 \nResearch Institute and, in February 2009, approved by the Lanzhou Environmental Protection \nBureau. ADB has reviewed, through its environment committee, the EIA and its summary, which \nwas circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and posted on its website on 5 June 2009. The EIA \nassessed  the  environmental  impacts  of  Project  components  and  prescribed  environmental \nprotection  and  mitigation  measures.  To  ensure  that  all  potentially  adverse  environmental \nimpacts of the Project are mitigated, the PMO will implement an environmental management \nplan, whose measures will be incorporated into bidding documents and contracts for civil works. \n \nF.  Risks \n \n70.  The following risks could affect the timely implementation or economic viability of the \nProject, or the realization of its benefits: (i) inadequately designed BRT that fails to improve the \nefficiency of public transport or attract people to use it to the extent projected, (ii) lacking \ncapacity  for  BRT  operation  and  management,  (iii)  lacking  cooperation  for  BRT  from  bus \noperators and other authorities, (iv) BRT ridership taken by LRT, (v) delay in the provision of \ncounterpart  funding,  and  (vi)  failure  to  provide  adequate  assistance  to  people  affected  by \ninvoluntary resettlement. Risks will be mitigated through the (i) provision of consulting services \nto supervise BRT design; (ii) provision to LMG and the PMO of institutional capacity building for \nBRT operation and management planning; (iii) development of manuals for BRT operation and \nmanagement and implementation of training; (iv) well-coordinated design and development of \nthe  LRT;  (v)  covenanted  assurances  on  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding;  and \n(vi)  management of resettlement to include (a) favorable compensation, relocation, and social \nsecurity policies of LMG; (b) livelihood training; (c) semiannual resettlement implementation \nmonitoring; and (d)  strengthening of internal monitoring and supervision. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n71.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, GPG, LMG, and PMO have \ngiven the following key specific assurances:  \n(i)  Construction quality. LMG will (a) cause the PMO to ensure that all the works \nof  the  Project  are  designed  and  constructed  in  accordance  with  national \nstandards  and  specifications,  and  that  the  construction  supervision,  quality \ncontrol, contract management, and completion inspection and acceptance follow \napplicable national laws and regulations, and (b) maintain the PSC throughout \nthe life of the Project, to be responsible for coordination among all municipal \nentities in regard of the implementation of the Project. \n(ii)  Counterpart funding. GPG and LMG will ensure that (a) all local and foreign \ncurrency counterpart financing necessary for the Project will be provided in time \nas required to enable completion of project activities, and prompt debt repayment \nafter project completion; (b) additional counterpart funding will be provided for \nany shortfall of funds or cost overruns; and (c) in each fiscal year adequate funds \nare allocated for operation and maintenance of the project facilities, and such \nfacilities are operated and maintained according to sound engineering practices. \n(iii)  Finance Management.

The  financial  management  system  shall  comprise  (a)  financial \nplanning,  budgeting,  and  budgetary  control;  (b)  accounting  consistent  with \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "18  \napplicable  PRC  standards;  (c)  internal  control;  (d)  data  processing;  and \n(e) financial reports. \n(iv)  Bus  Rapid  Transit.  LMG  will  cause  LPTG  to  improve  service  quality,  and \nincrease the efficiency of BRT operation through maintaining and increasing the \nlevel of revenue and controlling and reducing maintenance and operation costs. \nFor this purpose, LMG will, not later than after 3 years of successful operation of \nBRT bus lines, cause LPTG to consider participation and investment in BRT lane \noperation by those including the private sector. \n(v)  Traffic demand management and non-motorized transport. LMG will establish \na steering committee to implement TDM strategy and policy reform and a NMT \ndevelopment plan, which will consist of high-level officials of LMG, including but \nnot limited to the Planning Bureau, Pricing Bureau, Construction Committee, \nCommunications Bureau, Traffic Police Department, and Traffic Police Brigade. \nThe  steering  committee  will  also  ensure  coordination  of  the  relevant \nadministrations and implementation of output of the TDM strategy and policy \nreform and the NMT development plan. \n(vi)  Coordination between light rail transit and bus rapid transit. LMG will ensure \nthat the design and development of the LRT be fully coordinated with the BRT \nand will not be done in a way that may detract from the BRT. LMG will submit the \nLRT project proposal for ADB review as soon as it is completed. \n(vii)  Operation  and  maintenance.  LMG  will  ensure  that  adequate  funding  and \nhuman resources are allocated to ensure the project roads, BRT lanes, bridges, \nutilities, streetlights, advanced traffic control system, BRT stations and facilities, \nand environmental facilities are maintained and operated in good condition. \n(viii)  Monitoring  of  Clean  Development  Mechanism.  LMG  will  ensure  that  the \nappointed government staff will (a) coordinate within and outside LMG for CDM-\nrelated issues; (b) carry out data collection and surveys and set up and update a \ndatabase for CDM application, validation, and monitoring; (c) support the PMO \nand ADB in the preparation of the CDM application; and (d) serve as the CDM \nand climate change knowledge focal point for the PMO and various government \nand non-government agencies in Gansu and Lanzhou. \n(ix)  Road safety.

Urban transport in Lanzhou has many similarities with that of other cities in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Walking and biking accounted for 73.8% of trips up to 5 km, and public \ntransport dominates longer trips (90% buses and 4% taxis). Estimates suggest that walking \naccounts for more than 50% of personal trips, bicycles 20%, buses 22%, and personal vehicles \nand taxis around 3% each. There were 247,000 vehicles in circulation in the city in 2007, \nincluding 6,700 taxis and 2,350 buses. Motorization is fast, with 30,000 new vehicles in 2007 \nand growth of 12% per annum over the last 10 years, two thirds of which is personal vehicles \n(growing by 20% per annum). \n \nFigure A3: Motor Vehicles in Lanzhou City \n300,000 16.0%\n14.2%\n13.5% 14.0%\n250,000 n\no\n11.4% 11.5% 247,451 12.0% ati\ncles 200,000 10.3% 10.2% 217,965 10.0% gistr\nd vehi 150,000 8.8% 171,185 190,924 8.0% e in re\nRegistere 100,000 116,115 128,121 139,443 153,715 46..00%% ual increas\nn\n50,000 An\n2.0%\n0 0.0%\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n% Increase Total Number of motor vehicles (End of Year)\n \n                      Source: Lanzhou City Traffic Police Brigade. \n \n \n2.  Road Traffic. The road system comprises 1,136 kilometers (km) of roads, including \n360.5 km in urban areas categorized as trunk, secondary, or branch (Table A3.1). Primary trunk \nroads do not have clear division of function; they operate with a combination of interrupted traffic \nwhere there are several traffic signals and uninterrupted traffic in areas with grade-separated \ninterchanges. Public transport is concentrated along a few corridors, and not enough space is \nprovided for bus stops, resulting in long lines of buses in the bus lanes. Mixed traffic, inadequate \nroad land-use policies, and poor enforcement of parking regulations contribute to a great deal of \non-road friction. An inadequate road structure has caused traffic congestion in the city center. \n \nTable A3.1: Composition of Classified Urban Road Network \nRoad Class  Length (km)  Percentage \nExpressway  0.0  0.0 \nTrunk Road  73.3  20.3 \nSecondary Road  103.7  28.8 \nBranch Road  183.5  50.9 \n  Total  360.5  100.0 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Lanzhou Public Traffic Special Plan (2007). \n \n3.  Traffic  signal  control  systems  are  an  area  where  the  city  has  made  progress  and \nbenefits from a good institutional capacity. The Lanzhou Public Security Bureau Traffic Police \nBrigade  has  responsibility  for  system  development,  operating  regulations,  and  policy \nenforcement. Lanzhou has an extensive system of traffic signal controls in all urban districts, \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nand particularly in Chengguan and Qilihe, the most densely populated. They are managed \nremotely and built around the most advanced optimization technology. However, Anning district \nlags behind, as only 20 intersections are controlled with signals, installations use older and \nsimpler technology, and roughly half are primarily used on a yellow flash cycle due to their \nlimited capability. The development of Anning will require upgrading the on-road equipment on \nthe  newly  constructed or rehabilitated  roads. Further,  the  Lanzhou  Public  Security  Bureau \nTraffic Police Brigade has assessed that introducing an intelligent transport system could bring \nsubstantial efficiency gains by reducing road congestion and improving enforcement. A future \ntraffic signal control system will integrate the various on-road control systems and bring road \noperation in line with good practice. \n \n4.  Public Transport. Public transport in Lanzhou is undertaken in taxis and buses. Trolley \nbuses were discontinued in 2008, and the rail lines crossing the city are used mainly by intercity \npassenger and freight transport. The Lanzhou Public Transport Group (LPTG) is responsible for \noperating public buses. LPTG possesses 2,089 buses in 2009 and operates on 92 routes. \nThere are about 99 minibuses in 2009, which individual operators run with no fixed bus stops. \nThe Lanzhou municipal government has bought up the individual bus companies to consolidate \nthem into LPTG. Bus running speed is high on average at 16.7 kilometers (km) per hour. The \nnumber of buses, at 1.15 per 1,000 people, appears adequate. Technology-oriented innovations \nhave contributed to improved operational and environmental efficiency. In 2000, LPTG started \nimplementing the integrated circuit card system on selected routes. Today all routes and buses \nare equipped with the system. LPTG converted the bus fleet from diesel to compressed natural \ngas. Those measures have produced positive results, as growth in the number of passengers in \npublic buses in 2007 reached 473 million, against 426 million and 359 million in the previous 2 \nyears. \n \n5.  The development of bus services has mostly followed rather than accompanied urban \nexpansion. The route network has a high degree of overlap on the main corridors and is \nconvoluted, with many deviating lines. Route and station coverage are good in the central area \nbut fall below People\u2019s Republic of China standards in the urban area as a whole, with a route \ncoverage coefficient standing at 0.94 km/km2, against a 3\u20134 km/km2 benchmark in the center \nand  2\u20132.5  km/km2  in  adjoining  areas.  There  are  several  gaps  in  service  coverage,  most \nparticularly in Anning. Also, bus services are uniformly structured throughout, while an optimal \nstructure would have a mass transit system as a core, trunk lines using common buses, and \nsmaller feeder lines using minibuses.  \n \n6.  Demand for public transport in Lanzhou is projected to grow by 2.1 times from 2005 to \n2020. The number of buses is projected to grow by 1.9 times during that period (Table A3.2). \n \nTable A3.2: Public Transport Development, 2006\u20132020 \nUrban  Public Transport  Passenger Trips by  Bus Fleet \nResidents  Market Share  Public Transport  (standard \nYear  (million)  (%)  (million)  units) \n2006  2.0  22  1.16  2,016 \n2010  2.1\u20132.5  28\u201331  1.61  2,350\u20132,600 \n2015  2.7\u20133.2  32\u201336  2.17  2,800\u20133,150 \n2020  3.5\u20134.0  38\u201340  2.34  2,900\u20133,300 \nSource: Lanzhou Public Traffic Special Plan (2007). \n \n7.  Parking  Management.  Parking  needs  in  Lanzhou  were  not  taken  into  account \nsufficiently in previous urban plans. The resulting shortage of underground and off-road parking \n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nin central areas has left drivers parking on sidewalks and in non-motorized transport (NMT) \nlanes, creating obstacles to NMT traffic and reducing the attractiveness of the streetscape. \nParking policies have led to inefficient demand patterns, increasing congestion in the central \nbusiness district. Currently, there is a flat parking charge of CNY2\u20133 regardless of the time \nparked. This is far below the opportunity costs of road space usage, and the Government has \nidentified the need to revamp its parking management and pricing policy. Demand-based pricing \nhas good potential as a tool to manage demand; it would involve differential pricing by area in \nthe city, number of hours parked, and period of the week. Rationalizing parking space would \nentail exploring legal options for contracting out parking management. \n \n8.  Non-Motorized  Transport.  The mobility of pedestrians and bicycles has started to \ndecline. NMT, still the mainstay of the poorer sections of the society, has declined as motor \nvehicles progressively dominated the roads and as trip distances grew in line with the city's \nexpansion. There are worsening safety problems because pedestrian crossings are few and are \nfrequently obstructed; NMT lanes have been encroached on by motor vehicles, either moving or \nparked; and cyclists are often forced to operate in dangerous mixed traffic. Lack of parking \nfacilities and risk of theft are cited as significant impediments for bicycle use.  \n \n9.  NMT, as a mode chosen by the users rather than imposed by poverty, will be an \nessential element of the city's transport system. An integrated network of protected or separated \nbicycle lanes is needed, together with bicycle parking facilities at bus stations. Bicycle rental \nschemes may be considered. For pedestrians, the road network needs to be made safer with \nappropriate sidewalks, mid-block crossings, and pedestrian signals. Efforts are needed to create \na more attractive streetscape, as well as to make urban blocks either smaller or allow NMT \nthrough traffic. \n \n10.  Transport Externalities. The increased use of motor vehicles has heightened road \nsafety concerns in Lanzhou. The incidence and severity of accidents are relatively high when \ncompared with other cities of similar population. Lanzhou had 723 traffic accidents in 2007 that \ncaused 723 injuries and 305 fatalities, 57% of which were pedestrians (Table A3.3). The fatality \nrate in urban areas exceeds 100 per million habitants, higher than in Shanghai (85) or the \nEuropean Union average of 88, despite one sixth the rate of motorization. Causes of accidents \ninclude poor road design that does not cater well for NMT traffic, unsafe driving habits, and the \nlack of safety awareness among pedestrians. \n \nTable A3.3: Lanzhou City Traffic Accidents \n   2007 \nItem   Accidents  Fatalities  Injuries \nPedestrians  360  173  317 \nBicycles  86  38  75 \nTrucks  103  59  97 \nCars and Buses  174  35  234 \n  Total  723  305  723 \n                                   Source: Lanzhou City Traffic Police Brigade. \n \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \n \nCONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF URBAN ROADS \n \n1.  The  Project  will  contribute  realizing  the  urban  master  plan  by  supporting  the \ndevelopment of the urban road network and the urban mass transport system serving the new \ncity center in Anning. To support rapidly increasing traffic demand, 16 urban road sections will \nbe constructed or reconstructed, consisting of 21.4 km of new roads and 12.4 km of existing \nroads.  \n \n2.  The proposed Lanzhou bus rapid transit will be constructed mainly in the new city \ncenter, but the bus rapid transit corridor will extend across the Yellow River, providing a link to \nthe current city center, passing through Dunhuang Road, T514, T514-1, T514-2, T532, and \nT577 from east to west, with a total length of 13.0 km.  \n \n3.

Urbanization has rapidly increased demand for urban transport in Anning and throughout \nLanzhou. The population of Anning in 2007 was 234,400, of which 88% was classified as urban. \nFrom 2005 to 2020, demand for public transport in Lanzhou is expected to grow by 2.1 times, \nthe number of registered passenger vehicles is expected to grow by 6.8 times, and the number \nof buses is expected to grow by 1.9 times. Bus rapid transit (BRT) can sustainably meet \ndemand for urban transport in Lanzhou and mitigate negative externalities. It offers low-cost, \nefficient, flexible, and environmentally friendly mass transport. BRT will be constructed mainly in \nthe Anning new city center, but the BRT corridor will across the Yellow River and connect to the \ncurrent city center. This connection will increase the efficiency and convenience of BRT as part \nof Lanzhou's urban mass transport system and strengthen the outcome and impact of the \nLanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project (the Project).  \n \nA.  Bus Rapid Transit Corridor \n \n2.  The BRT corridor has been selected based on studies of demand for public transport, \ntaking into account the needs of passengers and operational requirements of bus operators. \nCurrent bus route coverage provides a useful approximation of demand along the corridor. \nAnning Road has the densest bus traffic of the seven operated bus routes (3, 15, 72, 103, 121, \n131, and 310). Based on this demand, Anning Road has the potential to be a successful BRT \ncorridor. The corridor has sufficient space for incorporating BRT stations and bus lanes. Peak \npassenger flows currently exceed 5,000 passengers per hour per direction (pphpd), and there is \nstrong demand in both directions throughout the day.  \n \n3.  Taking into account the large amount of planned new development in the district, and \nthe removal of city government offices to Anning, peak passenger flows are expected to exceed \n8,000 pphpd by the end of 2010. This would make the Anning Road corridor one of the busier \nBRT systems in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and other countries in the region in terms \nof passenger flows, assuming that all bus passengers use BRT (Figure A5.1).  \n \nFigure A5.1: Potential of the Anning BRT Corridor \nn \no\ncti\ne\ndir\ner \np\nur \no\nh\ner \np\ns \ner\ng\nn\ne\ns\ns\na\nP\n \n \nBRT = bus rapid transit, pphpd = passengers per hour per direction, km/hr = kilometers per hour \n  Source: Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. \n ", "  Appendix 5  33 \n4.  The BRT corridor will start at Xi Zhan, a train station in the current city center in Qilihe \nand connected to the current bus center. The corridor will take Dunhuang Road, cross over the \nYellow River, and connect to Anning Road from east to west. The western endpoint of BRT will \nbe at Anning Pu, a station that is the gateway to Renshoushan Park. The length of the BRT \ncorridor will be 13 km. \n \nB.  Bus Rapid Transit Stations \n \n5.  BRT stations are a critical feature of BRT systems because they set limits on system \ncapacity. The design of BRT stations directly affects the traffic efficiency of BRT corridors and \nroad  safety  for  passengers.  High-quality  station  design,  including  station  dimensions  and \nconfiguration to match, is essential for a well-functioning BRT system. The stations for Lanzhou \nBRT need to be designed taking into account the experiences of existing BRT systems in the \nPRC  and  elsewhere.  The  proposed  22  stations  in  the  Lanzhou  BRT  will  provide  average \nspacing of around 600 meters between stations, taking into account the current locations of the \nbus stations, Lanzhou Urban Master Plan, Lanzhou New City Area Plan, and findings of demand \nsurveys, including of the number of passengers at peak hours in the morning and evening. One \nof the lessons from other BRTs in the PRC is that BRT stations should not be located near \nintersections,  as  this  often  results  in  vehicles  blocking  the  intersections  and  pedestrian \ncrossings. All stations of the Lanzhou BRT are located at least 75 meters from intersections but \nclose to existing bus stops. Another lesson is that some BRT systems fail to realize potential \ntime saving benefits for bus passengers and road users if there are long queues at ticket \nwindows, heavy crush loading during peak periods, or BRT corridors open to mixed traffic and \nprone to congestion during peak periods. The length and width of the station will be determined \nbased on demand surveys, and each station will include bicycle parking, a fare collection \nsystem, sliding doors for safety, light and water, and real-time bus operation information boards.  \n \n6.  A  further  lesson  is  the  need  to  build  in  potential  for  future  expansion  of  BRT \ninfrastructure, particularly in stations. The Lanzhou BRT will allow for system capacity to be \nexpanded in the future at low cost because it will reserve a green median that can later be \nconverted into additional station extensions and bus lanes. Figure A5.2 shows an example of \nshort-term BRT station design (the diagram above) and medium term (the diagram below). The \nsize of station in the diagram above is designed to meet short-term demand for BRT. This \ndesign minimizes initial construction and equipment costs for the station. Space for future \nexpansion is secured in green medians. Until future station expansion, the green medians serve \nas buffer zones to improve landscape appearance and road safety. The diagram below shows \nmedium-term BRT station design. The green area is set back and the stations are expanded. \nFuture demand is recalculated at this stage of expansion, so the risk of a gap between future \ndemand and size of the stations is minimized. \n \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \n \nFigure A5.2: Short-Term and Medium-Term Bus Rapid Transit Design \nGreen Median (Phase II  Green Median (Phase II) \n \n \nNotes: \n1.

Station of BRT built in long-term should be more than 100 m away from intersections. \n4.  Green median at intersection can be shortened by 4 m to increase number of approaching lines and \nenhance capacity at intersection. \n \nBRT = Bus Rapid Transit \n Source: Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. \nC.  Bus Rapid Transit Operation \n7.  There are two types of BRT operation in broad terms. Figure A5.3 compares flexible and \nclosed BRT systems. In a closed system, BRT buses operate only inside the BRT corridor. In a \nflexible system, selected BRT routes operate both inside and outside the BRT corridor and allow \nfor both existing buses and specialized BRT buses if introduced. The BRT systems in Dalian, \nChangzhou, Hangzhou, and Jinan are flexible. Those in Beijing, Chongqing, and Xiamen are \nclosed.  \n \n8.  The Lanzhou BRT will use the flexible system, so there is no need to establish a \ncompany for BRT operation. The Lanzhou Public Transport Group, a state-owned company and \nthe current bus operator in Lanzhou, will use the BRT lanes with existing environmentally \nfriendly  buses  that  run  on  compressed  natural gas.  No  other  bus company  now  exists  in \nLanzhou, but if a new qualified bus company is established, the BRT lanes should be open to it. \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  35 \n \nFigure A5.3: Flexible versus Closed System \nFlexible Operations \nClosed Operations \n \nBRT = bus rapid transit   \nSource: Institute for Transportation and Development  Policy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "36  Appendix 6 \n \nASSISTANCE FOR CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM APPLICATION \nFROM ADB'S CARBON MARKET INITIATIVE \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  Lanzhou  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Project  (the  Project)  includes  the \ndevelopment of a bus rapid transit (BRT) system that may be eligible for carbon credits under \nthe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. The Project is in compliance \nwith  relevant  policy,  regulatory,  and  development  plans  as  set  forth  by  the  government \nauthorities of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). In particular, the BRT component is in line \nwith  all  clauses  stipulated  in  the  Measures  for  Operation  and  Management  of  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism Projects in China issued by the National Development and Reform \nCommission. The BRT component will meet the objective of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and will be eligible to gain carbon credits under the CDM if \nregistered  with  the  CDM  executive  board.  If  successfully  registered  and  implemented  as \nplanned, BRT stands to generate approximately 5,000 certified emission reductions (CERs) \nannually. CER prices vary depending on market conditions, but at $10 per CER,1 for example, \nthe Project can generate additional annual revenue of $50,000.  \n \n2.  ADB Mission and the Clean Development Mechanism. The mission of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is to reduce poverty in Asia and the Pacific. A key means to achieve \nthis mission is through financing infrastructure and other projects in ADB developing member \ncountries. The CDM promotes sustainable development in developing countries. CDM rules \nrequire certification from host country governments that the projects have voluntary initiatives \nthat help them achieve sustainable development.  \n3.  ADB has taken several initiatives to mainstream climate change considerations in its \nfunding.  ADB\u2019s  current  CDM  support  program  is  administered  through  the  Carbon  Market \nInitiative (CMI), managed by the Sustainable Infrastructure Division of the ADB Regional and \nSustainable Development Department. CMI has three components: (i) upfront carbon financing \nthrough the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund and the Future Carbon Fund; (ii) CDM-related technical \nsupport through the technical support facility (TSF); and (iii) marketing support for residual \ncarbon credits through the Credit Marketing Facility. \n4.  ADB's CMI supports the proposed Project\u2019s application to the CDM with a national expert \nin the PRC and through CDM experts at ADB headquarters. \nB.  Application to the Clean Development Mechanism \n \n5.  Methodology for Estimating Baseline and Project Emissions. CDM projects are \nexpected to establish a baseline scenario that would have prevailed if the CDM project had not \nbeen  undertaken. The proposed  BRT  projects falls  under sectoral  scope  7  (transport),  as \ndefined under CDM modalities and procedures, and meets the applicability conditions and \nrequirements of the approved large-scale CDM methodology, ACM0016-Baseline Methodology \nfor Mass Rapid Transit Projects (Version 01). \n \n6.  Baseline Survey and Data Collection. ACM0016 involves about 21 equations and 29 \nparameters for calculating baseline, projects, and leakage emissions. Since November 2008, \nADB's TSF has discussed the baseline survey and data collection with the project management \noffice to determine the baseline scenario of the BRT project. The TSF has supported the project \n                                                \n1  The current market for CERs extends to the end of first commitment period in 2012. Negotiations for the second \nKyoto Protocol commitment period are in progress. Should there be an agreement on the modalities, it is possible \nthat after 2012 CERs may fetch a price higher than the current price of \u20ac8\u2013\u20ac9. \n ", "  Appendix 6  37 \nmanagement office in preparing a plan for implementing a baseline survey and discussed in \ndetail the specific survey methods and statistical requirements for specific parameters. \n7.  Data for some parameters were sourced from relevant local authority statistics and \nrecords. An on-site survey will be carried out to collect the remaining data required. A range of \nparameters in relation to specific fuel consumption, occupancy rate, average speed, average \ndistance  driven  and  so  forth  of  various  vehicle  types  are  involved.  Questionnaire-based \nsubjective survey is included as part of the on-site survey, for the purpose of seeking responses \nfrom passengers on a series of travel-related questions, such as the origins and destinations of \ntheir trips, choices of vehicles, etc. However, since ACM0016 does not provide a clear guidance \non how to determine on ex-ante basis some of the parameters of ACM0016, requests need to \nbe submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat to seek authoritative explanation and clarification \nbefore the baseline traffic survey plan can be finalized. \n8.  In parallel to the preparation of the baseline traffic survey implementation plan, the \nproposed Lanzhou BRT Project-specific Feasibility Study Report (FSR) is being developed by \nan  experienced  professional  design  institute.  Besides  the  system  design,  investment  and \nfinancial analysis especially related to BRT system, the emphasis of the FSR will also be placed \non traffic forecasting, option analysis of various bus routes, etc., which is the key document \ndirectly  determining  the  prospect  of  the  project  development.  It  provides  the  authoritative \ntechnical,  economic  and  financial  information  based  on  which  the  CDM  Project  Design \nDocument (PDD) will be prepared. More importantly, the FSR is the fundamental reference \ndocument that will qualify the project for local governmental approval and enable the local \nproject proponent to take the project forward, from detailed technical design, infrastructure \nconstruction and system set-up, through system operation and management, construction and \nsystem set-up, and through system operation and management. \n9.

There is a growing understanding among policy-makers that relying on infrastructure \nconstruction alone that does not sustainably solve urban traffic congestion. It is inefficient and \ncostly in the long term. Regulatory and demand-side policies offer complementary instruments \nto meet the needs of users. Traffic demand management (TDM) is the process of adjusting or \nadapting the use of an existing road system to meet specified objectives without resorting to \nsubstantial new road construction. Effective traffic management can increase the capacity of \nexisting  transport  infrastructure  by  managing  traffic  flows  and  helping  to  address  traffic \ncongestion, road accidents, and vehicle emissions. The proposed Lanzhou Sustainable Urban \nTransport Project (the Project) will support (i) establishing a TDM strategy and reforming policy \non traffic management in Lanzhou, (ii) developing an advanced traffic control system (signal \ncontrol), and (iii) preparing a development plan for non-motorized transport (NMT). \n \nA.  Traffic Demand Management \n \n2.  TDM  strategies  address  traffic  congestion  by  reducing  or  optimizing  demand  for \ntransport and influencing user behavior. TDM attempts to influence travelers before they get into \ntheir cars by promoting alternative modes and destinations of travel and providing improved \noptions for drivers. A first set of measures aims to make efficient transport options\u2014such as \npark-and-ride,  work  schedule  adjustments,  flexi-time  and/or  compressed  workweek, \ntelecommuting, and car pooling\u2014more attractive to users, as well as facilitate NMT with safe, \nintegrated  walking  and  biking  paths  and  bicycle  parking.  A  second  set  is  market-based \nmeasures to reorient user behavior through price incentives. This may include road tolls that are \neither fixed or vary with congestion, area or cordon pricing for urban centers, pricing parking \nspaces, subsidizing transit fares, pay-as-you-drive vehicle insurance schemes, and increases to \nfuel or vehicle taxes. A third set of measures limits traffic to certain types of vehicles in certain \nareas or corridors, road rationing through alternative driving schemes (such as in Sao Paulo), or \nvehicle purchase auctions such as in Singapore or Shanghai.  \n \n3.  The impacts of market measures are summarized in Table A7.1. Strategies to manage \ntraffic demand have sometimes failed because public entities tried to sell undesirable public \ntransport or NMT to unwilling users.  \n \nTable A7.1: Impacts of Different Types of Pricing \nVehicle  Fuel  Fixed  Variable  Area  Car  Parking  Transit \nType of Impacts  Fees  Price  Toll  Toll  Pricing Insurance  Fee  Fares \nVehicle Ownership.

Advanced Traffic Management Components \n \n1.  Advanced Traffic Control System \n \n4.  The proposed intelligent road traffic control system for Lanzhou will use modern on-road \nequipment (e.g., traffic and pedestrian signals; variable message signs; and video and other \nmonitoring systems for stoplight violations, traffic lane adherence, license plate identification, \nspeed detection, vehicle weight control, and parking violations), communication and information \ntechnology capacity (voice and data communication networks and operation control rooms); and \na  comprehensive  management  system  (unified  management  interface  with  geographic \ninformation systems), database querying, cross-data processing, and analysis ability).

The general framework for the new traffic control system in Anning is detailed in Table \nA7.2. The implementation plan includes the following elements: \n(i)  comprehensive management system; \n(ii)  traffic control sub-center linked to the central Lanzhou Public Security Bureau \nTraffic Police Brigade control center; \n(iii)  new sets of on-street signal hardware at about 70 junctions, including signal \nheads and controllers, using cost- and energy-efficient light-emitting diode signal \nlamps instead of incandescent lamps; \n(iv)  special pedestrian-actuated signals on crossings of highly trafficked roads; \n(v)  video-detection equipment with software to detect incidents, monitor congested \nareas, and identify speeders and lane violators; \n(vi)  variable message signs with light-emitting diodes on major roads; and \n(vii)  electronic police (e-police) capability to detect stoplight violations and mobile \nequipment for officers to use for spot control of traffic and parking violations. \n6.  The Project will support the deployment of this system in the project area as well as the \nimplementation of the comprehensive management system to be used citywide. \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \n \n \n2.  Traffic Demand Management Strategy and Policy Reform \n \n7.  The  Project  will  streamline  TDM  concepts  and  strategy  in  the  Lanzhou  transport \ndevelopment. The scope of TDM and policy reform, such as (i) developing a TDM strategy, \nincluding recommendations, action plans, and TDM guidelines, that will enable LMG to build \ncapacity for TDM and incorporate TDM concepts and strategy into future city planning, such as \nthe urban master plan, public transport plans, and urban road design; (ii) reforming on a pilot \nbasis  the  current  pricing  policy  for  public  parking  by  introducing  a  demand-based  pricing \nsystem; (iii) developing the concept of pilot traffic-calming zones, which restrict high-speed \ndriving, through traffic, and trucks with traffic regulations and physical barriers; and (iv) advising \non the institutional coordination of TDM issues to LMG.  \n \n(i)  Traffic  demand  management  strategy  and  guidelines.  The  Project  will \n(a)   evaluate  the  midterm  and  long-term  impacts  of  user-attracting,  market-\nbased, and restrictive TDM measures to be developed; (b)  prepare a set of \nguidelines, strategies, and tactics by which the city integrates TDM concepts into \nthe future 4th Urban Master Plan (2010\u20132020) and 12th Transport 5-Year Plan; \n(c) revise municipal technical normative documents to integrate TDM concepts \nand the accessibility needs of people with restricted mobility; and (d) consolidate \nthese outputs as a TDM strategy for LMG and guidelines for their wide use. \n(ii)  Demand-based parking management. An efficient approach to reducing traffic \nin urban areas is to charge a relatively high parking fee in the city center, thereby \nmaking car use less attractive than public transport. The Project will develop a \nnew parking policy and management plan in collaboration with the administration \noverseeing parking management, including the creation of a parking supply-and-\ndemand database and a demand-based pricing management plan. \n(iii)  Traffic-calming zones. The Project will include a concept study and technical \nguidelines  for  implementing  traffic-calming  zones,  which  restrict  high-speed \ndriving, through traffic, and trucks with traffic regulations and physical barriers in \nresidential districts. \n(iv)  Institution building. The Project will advise on strengthening TDM coordination \nin LMG. The dispersal of responsibilities for TDM is an obstacle to efficient \npolicy-making. In Lanzhou, TDM has recently been taken over by an ad-hoc \nworking  group  composed  of  representatives  of  the  Traffic  Police  Brigade, \nFinancial  Bureau,  Construction  Committee,  Land  Planning  Bureau,  Land \nAdministration  Bureau,  and  Public  Transport  Group.  This  coordination \nmechanism is a substantial improvement but will prove insufficient in the long \nterm to fully integrate TDM in the administration's normal business processes. In \nmany other countries, administrations have created dedicated units that manage \nTDM programs and contribute to urban plans. They have a mixed staff of road \nengineers, road traffic operators, and transport and urban planners. Creating \nsuch a unit in LMG would likely bring substantial long-term benefits. \n \n3.  Non-Motorized Transport Development Plan \n \n8.  The mobility of pedestrians and bicycles has started to decline. NMT, still the mainstay \nof the poorer sections of the society, has declined as motor vehicles progressively dominated \nthe roads and as trip distances grew in line with the city's expansion. NMT, as a mode chosen \nby users rather than imposed by poverty, will be an essential element of the transport system. \nAn integrated network of protected or separated bicycle lanes will be created, bicycle parking \nfacilities will be built at bus stations, and bicycle rental schemes will be considered.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  41 \n \n \n9.  To make clear recommendations for NMT planning in Lanzhou, further investigation of \nthe current status of NMT is required. Reasons for decline may include the loss of secure \nbicycle  parking  and  worsening  crime.  Many  junction  designs  and  roadway  designs  are \nsuboptimal  from  the  point  of  view  of  pedestrian  and  cyclist  safety.  A  survey  will  provide \ninformation for establishing a strategy to support NMT.  \n \n10.  The Project will finance consulting services for designing the NMT Development Plan, \nconsolidating the outputs of the two following components. \n \n(i)  Issues and solutions for non-motorized transport promotion. The study will \nidentify specific reasons of declining NMT share and recommend solutions, as \nwell as specific needs for improvement, such as (a) design improvement, as \nmany junction designs and roadway designs are suboptimal from the point of \nview of pedestrian and cyclist safety; (b) better enforcement of traffic regulations \nfor effective NMT lanes, as some NMT lanes are misused for driving and parking; \n(c)  removing  black  spots  of  serious  pedestrian  and  bicycle  accidents; \n(d)  improving bicycle networks and connectivity for direct, safe, and secure links \nbetween residential and commercial or business areas; and (e) improving bicycle \nparking  facilities,  as  areas  with  major  bus  demand  have  either  reduced  or \ninsecure bicycle parking. \n(ii)  Non-motorized  transport  development  framework.  The  study  will  prepare \n(a) a financing framework for NMT interventions, (b) the introduction of transit-\noriented development, (c) an incentive scheme for shopkeepers and employers \nto  support  NMT,  (d)  engineering  normative  designs  for  road  networks,  and \n(e)  campaigns for NMT promotion and safety. \n \n ", " \n \n \n  4\n2\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES   \nTable A8.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category a \n        $ Million    CNY million        A\np\n        Foreign  Local  Total    Foreign  Local   Total    % of Total  p\ne\nItem        Exchange  Currency  Cost    Exchange  Currency  Cost    Base Cost  n\nd\nA.

The Project \n \n1.  The main activity of the Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project (the Project) is \nconstructing, rehabilitating and operating urban roads and establishing bus rapid transit (BRT) \nfacilities and non-motorized transport lanes. The Project will not earn any direct revenue from \nconstructing urban roads or BRT facilities.  \n \n2.  The Executing Agency for the Project is the Lanzhou Municipal Government (LMG). The \nnewly established Lanzhou Municipal Foreign Loan Utilization Office (LMFLUO) is responsible \nfor  managing  and  coordinating foreign  loan  utilization  in  Lanzhou,  with  the  director  of the \nLanzhou Municipal Development and Reform Commission acting as the director of LMFLUO. \nThe project management office has been established in and under LMFLUO.  \n \n3.  The Project involves the construction of new roads, rehabilitation of existing roads, and \ncreation of a BRT system, with 40.8% of the project cost for the construction and rehabilitation \nof roads and 3.0% for BRT stations and equipment. Land acquisition and resettlement will \namount to 39.5% of the project cost.  \n \nB.  Project Financing and Its Effects on Lanzhou Municipal Government's Cash Flow \n \n4.  The Project will be funded from three sources: the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan, \na domestic bank loan from the Bank of China (BOC), and the LMG annual budget. The ADB \nloan will have a term of 25 years, including a 5-year grace period. The interest rate for the ADB \nloan is determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate\u2013based lending \nfacility and a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum. BOC is one of the leading bank in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, with a recorded profit of CNY64.4 billion for 2008 and an asset \nbase of CNY6,952 billion on 31 December 2008. The BOC loan will comprise a series of annual \nloans throughout construction, with interest paid quarterly and full repayment of the principal in \n10 years and a grace period of 5 years at an estimated annual interest rate of 5.94%. \n5.  As the Project will not earn any direct revenue, the debt service requirements of both \nloans are the responsibility of LMG and will be paid through the LMG annual budget. The \nadditional cash flow requirements of LMG during project implementation and up to 2033 were \nanalyzed. Throughout the period, the additional financing needed each year for repaying the \nADB loan will not exceed 1% of the total budget of LMG.  \n6.  The Project is to develop infrastructure supporting a new city center for Lanzhou with a \nfast-growing population and rapidly increasing land prices. LMG expects to benefit from land \nvalue increases after the implementation of the Project. If any such land value increases take \nplace, it will contribute positively to narrowing the budget deficit of LMG. As these possible sales \nof  land  are  not  part  of  the  project  scope,  potential  revenues  from  them  have  not  been \nconsidered in evaluating the financial capacity of LMG.  \nC.  Project Maintenance Costs \n \n7.  A public bus company, Lanzhou Public Transport Group, is the sole public bus operator \nin Lanzhou and will handle services in the BRT lanes. City buses operating on some designated \nroutes will be moved to the newly established BRT lanes. The main responsibility for the \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \n \nsustainability of project assets will be with LMG. Details of maintenance arrangements are given \nbelow.  \n \n8.  After the completion of the Project, roads and bridges will be maintained by Anning and \nQilihe  district  urban  infrastructure  management  stations,  utilities  will  be  maintained  by  the \nInfrastructure Management Station of Anning District, advanced traffic management systems will \nbe maintained by the Lanzhou Municipal Traffic Police Brigade, BRT stations and ticketing \nmachines will be operated and maintained by the Lanzhou Public Transport Group, platforms of \nthe BRT stations and BRT lanes will be maintained by the Infrastructure Management Station of \nAnning District, street lights will be maintained by the Street Lightning Management Section, and \nthe  advanced  environmental  monitoring  system  will  be  maintained  by  the  Anning  District \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau. This arrangement for operation and maintenance is practical \nand appropriate.  \n9.  In addition to debt servicing, LMG needs to allocate funds for maintaining project assets. \nMaintenance costs are estimated for project improvements on the BRT and other routes. BRT \nroute improvements include stations and roadway elements. Non-BRT routes include only road \npavement-related maintenance. \n10.  Two types of maintenance work must be financed after the completion of the Project: \n  (i)  routine annual maintenance such as,  \n(a)  for  roadways,  pothole  repair,  crack  sealing,  guardrail  safety,  debris \nremoval, and snow removal; \n(b)  for stations, window replacement, bench repair, painting, landscaping, \ntrash and graffiti removal, and equipment repair. \n(ii)  periodic maintenance of roadways, such as major surface replacement.  \n \n11.  The following assumptions were used to estimate the annual maintenance costs of the \nProject. Routine roadway maintenance costs are based on cost per square meter, while station \nmaintenance costs used a standard annual cost for each of the two types of station sizes. \nInformation technology equipment maintenance is also based on an annual standard cost. For \nroadway costs, it is assumed that periodic maintenance is needed every 7 years.  \n12.  By  applying  these  assumptions  for  the  project  roadways  and  stations,  maintaining \nproject assets has the following maintenance costs. The funds to cover these costs will come \ndirectly from the LMG annual operating budget through the Urban Infrastructure Management \nDivision, whose current, 2009 annual urban road maintenance budget is CNY427.93 million. \nThe additional maintenance expenditures that are needed for maintaining project roads will \nincrease the annual maintenance budget of the Urban Infrastructure Management Division only \nby 3.7%.

Clean Development Mechanism \n \n13.  The  Carbon  Market  Initiative  is  a  value-added  service  extended  to  ADB-supported \nprojects for clean energy, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. The Project \nwill receive support from the Carbon Market Initiative for preparing an application to the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism to approve BRT for trading in certified emission reductions (CERs). \nThe potential for CERs was initially accessed based on the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO ) \n2\nemissions resulting from BRT implementation. The reduction in carbon emissions is a direct \nresult of the expected modal shift away from private vehicles and into public transit that is \nfacilitated by this Project.  \n14.  It is assumed that the number of passenger trips in Anning District is unaltered with the \nintroduction of a BRT. However, passengers are expected to switch from one mode to another. \nThe diverted traffic from all vehicles to the BRT will reduce CO  emissions in Anning. If the \n2\nProject is registered under the Clean Development Mechanism, it will likely receive 5,000 CERs \nper year. CER prices fluctuate depending on market conditions, but applying a conservative \nestimate of $10 per CER (discounted), the project can generate an additional annual revenue \nstream of $50,000 or $0.5 million over the next 10 years. This additional income can help LMG \nmeet part of its BRT operating and maintenance expenses. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \n \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS  \n \n1.  Methodology  and  Assumptions.  The  economic  assessment  conducted  for  the \nLanzhou  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Project  (the  Project)  follows  the  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects 1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The evaluation period is \nfrom 2009 to 2033, with the period from mid-2009 to mid-2014 being project implementation and \nthe 20-year period from mid-2014 to 2033 being project operation. The commencement of \nproject implementation in mid-2009 assumes ABD\u2019s approval of retroactive financing for some \nresettlement and civil works. For all quantifiable project costs and benefits, the unit of account \nused is the domestic price expressed in the national currency of the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nthe Chinese Yuan (CNY). All project costs and benefits are expressed in constant 2009 prices. \nFor converting foreign costs to domestic cost equivalents, the shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.03 from a recently approved ADB road project has been used.2 \n \n2.  Alternatives Analysis. A number of alternatives were considered for the Project. The \n\u201cno action\u201d alternative addresses the likely consequences of not implementing the Project. This \nalternative would work against the goals of the economic development in Lanzhou by allowing \nthe build-up of traffic congestion and air and noise pollution. \n \n3.  The alternative of \"no investment in bus rapid transit (BRT) facilities or advanced traffic \nmanagement\u201d would have the following consequences:  \n(i)  Existing travel behavior trends would continue, with high growth in private vehicle \nuse  and  associated  environmental  degradation  and  declining  use  of \nenvironmentally friendly and energy-efficient public transport. \n(ii)  Without  advanced  traffic  control,  ever-rising  traffic  volumes  would  become \nincreasingly slow and dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.  \n(iii)  Without an advanced environmental monitoring system, the information available \nto decision-makers about sources and levels of pollution in Anning would be \ninadequate, and it would be difficult to formulate an appropriate environmental \npolicy to address air pollution issues. \n(iv)  Without institutional capacity enhancement, local agencies would not be able to \nintroduce effective sector management strategies for sustainable urban transport. \n \n4.  Possible alternative interventions were considered to meet growing transport demand in \nAnning as part of the approved Lanzhou City Master Plan. Options were evaluated in light of \nenvironmental impacts, effects on land acquisition and resettlement, traffic flow and safety, and \nproject costs. The recommended project road location and alignment option were selected after \nthe analysis. \n \nA.  Economic Costs \n \n5.  Three types of economic costs were included in the evaluation: (i) initial investment, \n(ii) additional  investment,  and  (iii)  annual  recurring  costs.  The  initial  investment  includes \nresettlement  costs,  including  for  temporary  land  use,  building  replacement,  relocation  and \nreplacement of other facilities, compensation for standing crops, and administration costs. The \nopportunity cost of land is treated as an economic value not included as part of the initial \ninvestment schedule but as part of recurring costs. Environmental control costs include all \nmitigation and monitoring expenses during project implementation from 2009 to 2014.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople's Republic of China for the Xinjiang Regional Road Improvement Project (Korla\u2013Kuqa Section). Manila \n(Loan 2393\u2013PRC). \n ", "  Appendix 13  53 \n \nworks costs are estimated for each of the 11 new roads and 6 reconstructed roads. For each \nroad,  the  civil  works  cost  was  divided  into  earthworks,  pavement,  drainage  and  utilities, \nmiscellaneous including safety, and professional services. Civil works and environmental control \ncosts are divided into traded and non-traded costs. Traded materials are further divided into \ncement, steel, construction equipment, and other traded materials. For cement and steel, the \nconversion  factors  are  0.795  and  0.940.  For  equipment  and  other  traded  materials,  the \nconversion factor is 0.898. The shadow wage rate factor for skilled labor is 1.00 and the \nopportunity cost of unskilled labor is assumed at 0.67. Physical contingency is assumed at 10% \nof the base cost for civil works, resettlement, and environmental costs. \n \n6.  Additional investment consists of periodic maintenance every 7 years, in 2020 and 2027, \nat a cost equal to two thirds of the initial economic cost for pavement and 20% of the initial cost \nfor  drainage  and  utilities,  bridges  and  structures,  and miscellaneous costs (excluding  land \nacquisition and resettlement). The additional investment schedule includes the residual value of \nfixed  assets  estimated  at  a  30-year  economic  life  with  no  scrap  value  and  straight  line \ndepreciation. Annual recurring costs include (i) routine road and bridge maintenance and (ii) the \nopportunity cost of land. The national standard of CNY2 per square meter in 2008 is assumed to \nbe the cost of routine maintenance of the project road and bridge surface area for economic \nanalysis. This rate is increased annually at 2% to account for the increase in maintenance \nrequirements caused by the traffic load. The routine maintenance of roadside greenery, lighting, \nand  other  items,  estimated  at  CNY3  per  square  meter,  is  added  to the  annual  pavement \nmaintenance cost. These costs are expressed in economic terms using the following share of \ncost  components  in  the  nominal  cost:  cement 25%,  steel  5%,  other  traded  materials  5%, \nuntraded  materials  15%,  skilled  labor  20%,  unskilled  labor  10%,  and  equipment  20%.  In \nestimating the opportunity cost of land, the crop value of CNY110,660 per mu of irrigated \nfarmland and other land is used. The estimation assumes productivity increases of 4% per year \nfor farmland and 5% per year for other land. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n \n7.  Project benefits are broken down into the following five categories: (i) vehicle operating \ncost (VOC) savings, (ii) diverted traffic benefits, (iii) generated traffic benefits, (iv) time savings \nbenefits, and (v) other benefits. \n \n8.  Vehicle  Operating  Cost  Savings.  There  are  two  major  types  of  VOC  savings \nassociated  with  the  Project,  which  are  estimated  separately.  The  first  is  related  to  the \nreconstruction of existing roads included in the Project\u2019s scope. The current condition of roads \nto be reconstructed is characterized by high surface roughness, which causes higher VOCs \nfrom increased wear and tear and more frequent vehicle repairs. The second type of VOC is \nrelated to congestion along project roads. Particularly in urban areas, congestion is an endemic \nproblem as vehicular traffic increases, coupled with non-motorized transport. High congestion \nlowers operating speeds for less-than-optimal utilization of the vehicle\u2019s power train, braking \nsystem, and other components, causing higher VOCs. \n \n9.  The principal methodology used for both types of VOC savings is the VOC component of \nthe Highway Development Model Version 4. For each vehicle type the model assumes specific \nparameter values describing the vehicle\u2019s configuration, engineering characteristics, operation, \nand cost. Parameter estimates are provided for a cubic function (second-order polynomial) of \nVOC with international roughness index (IRI) as the independent variable describing surface \nroughness. Another mathematical relationship is estimated by the model as a cubic function of \nspeed with IRI as an independent variable. For estimating VOC savings on reconstructed roads, \nthe  IRI  is  assumed  to  be  8  under  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  conditions  and  2  under  \u201cwith  project\u201d \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \n \nconditions. Table A13.1 shows the VOC cost per vehicle-kilometer for different types of vehicles \nat IRI 8 and 2. The VOC difference in nominal terms is restated in economic terms and used \nwith the normal traffic projections to estimate the benefits associated with reconstructed roads. \nCongestion cost savings is the second item of benefits. The degree of congestion directly \ndetermines the average operating speed of vehicles. To estimate this benefit, multiple runs of \nthe VOC model were made so that point observations could be made between the independent \nvariable (speed) and the dependent variable (VOC), and a second-order polynomial curve was \nfitted with resultant parameter estimates for each vehicle type. The congestion savings have \nbeen estimated using these equations for normal traffic. \n \nTable A13.1: VOC and Average Vehicle Speed at IRI 2 and 8 \nVOC @ IRI 8  VOC @ IRI 2  VOC Difference  Speed @ IRI  Speed @ IRI 2 \nVehicle Type \n($/vkm)  ($/vkm)  ($/vkm)  8 (km/hr)  (km/hr) \nPrivate Car  0.360  0.277  0.083  20  28 \nCNG Taxi  0.345  0.268  0.077  22  30 \nMinibus  0.360  0.282  0.078  20  27 \nMedium bus  0.316  0.284  0.032  18  25 \nLarge bus  0.458  0.346  0.112  18  25 \nSmall truck  0.374  0.276  0.099  15  22 \nMedium truck  0.683  0.451  0.233  10  18 \nLarge truck  2.105  1.197  0.908  5  12 \nMotorcycle  0.077  0.060  0.017  20  25 \nCNG = compressed natural gas, hr = hour, IRI = international roughness index, km = kilometer, vkm = \nvehicle-kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n10.  Diverted Traffic Benefits. The objective of BRT is to increase the modal share for \npublic transport vehicles. By definition, any increase in the share of buses will decrease the \nmodal share of competing passenger transport modes, including private vehicles, minibuses, \netc. The economic benefit associated with this diversion is reduced total VOC for these vehicles. \nThe  estimation  of  the net  economic  benefit  associated  with this  diversion  is  expressed  in \nvehicle-kilometers  for  each  type  of  vehicle  multiplied  by  VOC  savings  expressed  as  the \ndifference between the VOC for a large bus and the VOC for the mode from which the diversion \nis made. \n \n11.  Generated Traffic Benefits. The Project\u2019s components include 11 new roads with a \ntotal length of 21.44 km. New roads attract new residential units, commercial establishments, \nwholesale and retail businesses, street vendors, and other types of economic activity. These \nactivities are attributable to the new roads, without which new commercial and residential units \nwould not be built. Based on the estimated traffic by vehicle type, the generated traffic benefits \nare estimated at one-half the VOC savings used for normal and diverted traffic. Generated \ntraffic  benefits  are  assumed  to  materialize  gradually  over  4  years,  since  commercial  and \nresidential units along the new roads take time to develop. \n \n12.  Time Savings Benefits. Using the vehicle operating speeds of the traffic assignment \nmodel, total passenger-hours and freight ton-hours have been estimated for \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout \nproject\u201d assumptions. The difference between the two sets of estimated hours is the passenger \nand freight hours saved by the Project. The average annual income per capita in Anning in 2007 \nwas CNY9,787. Assuming a workforce participation ratio of 50% in Anning, the average annual \nincome per worker is CNY19,574. The time savings benefit for passengers has been estimated. \nThe value of worker leisure time and non-worker time is assumed to be zero. In this respect, the \npassenger time savings calculation is conservative. For freight time savings, the constant 2008 \nadjusted economic value per ton for six traded commodities (coal, fertilizer, crude oil, petroleum, \nsteel, and grains) was estimated at CNY2,763 per ton, and the opportunity cost of capital at 8% \nper annum was assumed. \n ", "  Appendix 13  55 \n \n13.  Avoided Costs and Other Benefits. Two categories of benefits are included in this \ncategory. The first is avoided accident costs. Estimates by ADB indicate the cost of road \naccidents in the People\u2019s Republic of China was on the order of $12.5 billion, or CNY98.7 billion, \nduring 2004. This estimate includes vehicle and property damage, medical costs, and the \nestimated loss of victims\u2019 earning potential. Accident costs have been expressed in terms of \npassenger-kilometers at CNY0.068 per passenger-kilometer (PKM). The total PKM reduction \nunder the Project yields savings of 0.068/PKM in 2004, which is restated as CNY0.07667/PKM \nin  constant  2009  values.  Accident  costs  have  been  expressed  in  terms  of  PKM  at \nCNY0.07667/PKM in constant 2009 values. The shift from low-occupancy vehicles such as \nprivate  vehicles  to  large  buses  as  a result  of  the  Project means  the  PKM  reductions  are \nmultiplied by the accident cost per PKM to estimate accident cost savings. \n \n14.  The second category is benefits from reduced pollution. The Project incorporates a \nnumber of features to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily by encouraging modal shifts \naway  from  private  vehicles  and  toward  public  transport.  The  carbon  emission  factors  for \nLanzhou\u2019s compressed natural gas vehicle fleets were derived from fuel efficiency surveys in \nLanzhou at compressed natural gas stations and as reported by the public transit organization. \nEmission  reductions  beyond  2012,  when  the  current  commitment  period  under  the  Kyoto \nProtocol expires, are now valued at approximately $10 per ton of CO  reduced. There are more \n2\npollution  reduction  benefits  attributable  to  the  Project  (carbon  monoxide,  nitrogen  oxides, \nhydrocarbons, and suspended particles), which have not been quantified in the benefits stream. \n \nC.  Economic Evaluation, Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n \n15.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 17.02% (Table A13.2), with \nnet present value (NPV) at the annual discount rate of 12% amounting to CNY1.65 billion over \nthe 25-year evaluation period from 2009 to 2033. Benefits from VOC savings are the major \neconomic benefit (47.93%), followed by diverted traffic benefits (22.38%), time savings benefits \n(18.84%),  generated  traffic  benefits  (5.56%),  and  other  benefits  (5.27%).  Table  A13.3 \nsummarizes the results of selected sensitivity tests made on the data included in Table A13.2. A \n10% increase in costs reduces the EIRR to 15.72%, and a 10% decrease in benefits reduces \nthe EIRR to 15.58%. The switching value for costs is reached at +45.42% and for benefits at \n\u201331.23%. Costs for resettlement and civil works carry relatively less risk. The sensitivity tests \nindicate that the NPV for these cost categories is positive within the plausible range of variability. \nA 1-year delay in project implementation reduces the EIRR to 15.25% and NPV by 37.54%. It is \nunlikely that any risk associated with cost overruns will cause an EIRR of less than 12%. It is \nequally unlikely that any risk associated with reduced project benefits would make the Project \nunfeasible. \n \n16.  A stochastic simulation of variability in key project parameters was made using @RISK \nsoftware. Project costs and benefits were assumed to change following a uniform distribution so \nthat variability in parameter estimates will have an equal likelihood of occurrence. Costs were \nassumed to vary from \u201310% to +30% and benefits from \u201325% to +10%. Latin hypercube\u2013type \nrandom sampling was used, and the simulation ran to 500 iterations. The results show that in 16 \niterations (3.2%) the EIRR reached below 12% or NPV below zero.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project (the Project) includes urban road infrastructure that will support new \nurban development on the north side of the Yellow River. This will speed economic growth in this area, benefiting local \nresidents, including the poor. This Project is consistent with ADB's support for the Western Development Strategy as \nwell as economic stimulus through urban infrastructure development.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                         Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues. Only 5%\u201310% of the population of Anning is poor because it is located in the urban area of Lanzhou. \nThe main causes of poverty are unemployment and families with members who are disabled or have serious illnesses. \nThe Lanzhou municipal government (LMG) has social security policies to support these households. \n \nAnning is going through a period of rapid economic growth and social development. It was already the cultural and \neducational center of Lanzhou and, in 2004, was designated the new central business district and locus for LMG.  \n \nAnning has a number of poverty safeguards established, such as the minimum living security system, medical \ninsurance system for minimum living security recipients, low-rent housing system for minimum income recipients, and \nurban-rural endowment insurance system. \nThe Project will benefit the poor but is not classified as a poverty intervention because the poor and others alike will \nhave access to and benefit from the various road and transport service developments.   \n \n2. Design Features. The project design has stressed inclusive benefits for all people using the transport network in \nAnning. Equal attention has been given to vehicles, non-motorized vehicles, and pedestrians. People in Anning rely \nheavily on bus transport, and the Project aims to strengthen bus mass transit in an affordable manner for all citizens. \nLMG provides lower fares for vulnerable groups and the elderly. Traffic management and road safety are features to \naddress congestion  and  mixed  traffic  flows.  Special consideration  has  been provided  for  the  disabled.  These \nmeasures and design features are set out in the Social Development Action and Monitoring Plan (SDAMP). The \nresettlement plan includes exchange housing that ensures good-quality housing for low-income households. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. The benefits of the Project will be widespread among the urban districts of Lanzhou. However, the related \nurban development will have significant benefits for urban and rural residents in Anning. The beneficiaries include \n(i)  road users such as private vehicle owners, bus passengers and operators, bicycle owners, and pedestrians and \n(ii)  public and private sector offices such as universities, government offices, commercial businesses, and industries.  \n \nNew urban roads will improve connections between the two central business centers, thereby reducing travel times \nand increasing the options of finding employment outside of Anning. The Project will attract more commercial, \nresidential, and industrial development to Anning, which will expand local employment opportunities. Rural residents \nthat currently leave Anning to work as migrant workers in other districts or cities will find expanded employment \nopportunities close to home. \n \nThere are 2,750 disabled people in Anning, or 1.31% of the population. Disabled people are disproportionately poor in \nthe district, with 1,114 poor or especially needy people (40.5% of all disabled people). About 425 poor disabled people \nare currently on the minimum living security guarantee. LMG has policies, such as free bus service and blind paths, to \nprovide the disabled with better mobility. These measures have been incorporated into project design. Also, the \nProject will assess the transport demands of disabled people and may promote minibus services for them.  \n \nThere are only 1,508 ethnic minority people in Anning, or 1.83% of the population.  Most of the ethnic minority people \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \n \nin affected areas are Hui, who have a long tradition of successfully integrating with the majority Han population. The \ngovernment has provided preferential policies and programs for minorities. The Project will have no impacts on ethnic \nminorities. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nCommunity meetings have been conducted to discuss the detailed transport and related urban development plans.  \nConsultation with communities included focus group meetings, socioeconomic surveys, and informal discussions \nduring site visits. Focus group meetings have been held with community representatives, municipal agencies, and \nhouseholds in selected subdistricts. Village meetings were conducted for resettlement planning. \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing             Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?    Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe project will encourage the participation of village and residential committees in transport planning, implementation, \nand  operation.  Resettlement  has  been  formulated  with  inputs  from  affected  communities,  and  a  resettlement \ninformation booklet has been provided to all affected people. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues. The Project will enhance the urban road network and public transit system, which benefits women \nand men equally. The mobility of women in Anning is already very high, and the Project will enhance the quality and \nfrequency of transportation services in a safer manner. Other than land acquisition and resettlement, the Project will \nnot cause any significant adverse social impacts on women. A livelihood training program will be provided for affected \npeople, and 50% of training will target women. Coupled with some of the training programs already set up by the All \nChina Women\u2019s Federation, it is possible that women will benefit more in terms of employment and economic \ndevelopment. \n \n2.  Key Actions.

Yes         No      \n \n  \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 15 \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n1.  The proposed Lanzhou Urban Sustainable Transport Project (the Project) will include \nthree types of physical infrastructure activities that may have resettlement impacts: (i) bus rapid \ntransit and non-motorized transport network development; (ii) work on 18 urban roads, including \nbuilding  11  new  roads  and  reconstructing  7  existing  urban  roads;  and  (iii)  utility  tunnels, \nincluding  the  monitoring  system  of  utility  tunnels.  Based  on  the  impact  assessment,  the \nconstruction of the 11 proposed new urban roads totaling 21.55 km, and the construction of four \nresettlement sites, will involve the permanent acquisition or use of 122 hectares (ha) of land and \nthe  demolition  of  buildings  totaling  402,236  square  meters  (m2).  Twenty-five  villages  or \nresidential committees in seven subdistricts of Anning will be affected.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Implementation Arrangements \n \n2.  The resettlement objective for unavoidably affected people is to achieve equal or better \nincome and living standards in line with the People\u2019s Republic of China Land Administration Law \n(2004), State Council Document No. 28, and the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). Any people losing land, housing, other assets, or income \nsources will be assisted to fully restore their income and living standards. According to the \npolicy and basic socioeconomic conditions of Anning, land compensation standards have been \nestablished based on 27\u201331 times the average annual output value.  \n \n3.  For residents affected by house demolition, the main compensation package includes \nreplacement with new apartments provided at 40 m2 per person with rural residential status and \n30  m2  per  person  with  urban  residential  status.  If  the  affected  households  prefer  cash \ncompensation, double replacement value (CNY1,298 per m2) will be paid according to the \nstandard 40 m2 per person with rural residential status and 30 m2 per person with urban \nresidential  status.  Cash  compensation  at replacement  value  (i.e.,  CNY649  per m2)  will  be \nprovided for the amount of the demolished housing larger than that of the replacement standard. \nOther  compensation  is  a  moving  allowance  of  CNY400  per  household  and  a  transition \nallowance of CNY150/person per month. Households that lose land and other seriously affected \nhouseholds  with  be  entitled  to  training  and  assistance  with  reemployment.  For  affected \nenterprises and institutions, compensation and reconstruction arrangements will be made as \nevaluated by qualified real estate appraisal companies and negotiated agreements.  \n \nC.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n4.  To implement the resettlement plan in a smooth and effective manner, a resettlement \norganizational network from higher to lower governmental levels will be responsible for the \ndetailed planning, coordination, implementation, and monitoring of resettlement. Anning District \nResettlement Leading Group and Office and subdistrict resettlement groups and offices have \nbeen established to take charge of land requisition and resettlement. Village committees will \nplay an active role to ensure community participation in resettlement planning, implementation, \nand monitoring. \n \nD.  Vulnerable Groups \n \n5.  Some of the affected people in the project area are poor. For economically vulnerable \npeople, including the elderly living alone, disabled, households headed by single women, and \n ", "  Appendix 15  61 \n \npoverty  households,  the  Project  will  provide  additional  training  and  support.  The  affected \nhouseholds include those with current vulnerability as well as those facing severe impacts and \nrisks  caused  by  land acquisition  and resettlement. The specific type of  assistance  will  be \ndetermined  according  to  their  actual  condition  and  assessed  needs  during  detailed \nmeasurement surveys. The specific entitlements will be included in the household agreement. \n \nE.  Consultation and Grievance Redress \n \n6.  The  Land  Law  requires  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people.  Affected \nvillages have been notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan during meetings and \ninterviews.  Resettlement  information  will  be  disclosed  through  newspapers  to  all  affected \npeople. During detailed resettlement planning, there will be further notification and consultations \nto discuss specific impacts and how they will be addressed. Subdistrict and village officials will \nensure that any concerns raised by affected people are quickly addressed. In case of grievance, \nall  complaints  will  be  processed  according  to  Government  Regulation  Number  431  on \nGrievance and Redress. People can submit their oral or written complaint first to the village \ncommittee or township resettlement team. If their complaint is not settled in 2 weeks, the \naffected  person can  seek redress  at the  county  resettlement  office  within  1  month.  If still \nunresolved within 2 weeks, the project owner will try to achieve a solution with the affected \nperson. The final redress would be sought, if necessary, in the civil courts, in accordance with \nthe Civil Procedures Act. \n \nF.  Monitoring and Reporting \n \n7.  The  plan  for  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  included  in  the \nresettlement  plan.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  and  local  government  will  be \nresponsible for internal monitoring and supervision and reporting to higher government levels \nand  ADB.  The  PMO  will  engage  a  qualified  domestic  monitor  to  carry  out  independent \nresettlement monitoring and evaluation. The monitor will ascertain whether affected people have \n(i) received their full entitlements on time and (ii) fully restored their livelihoods, income, and \nliving standards. The monitor will conduct a baseline survey prior to resettlement, semiannual \ninvestigations during resettlement, and annual survey updates for 2 years after the completion \nof resettlement. The household survey will include a representative number of those severely \naffected by loss of land, those losing housing, and those classified as economically vulnerable. \nThe monitor will provide ADB and the PMO with copies of the monitoring and evaluation reports \ntwice a year during resettlement implementation and once a year after resettlement completion.  \n \nG.  Resettlement Cost and Implementation Schedule \n \n8.  The resettlement budget estimate is CNY1,215 million, including compensation for land, \nhousing,  other  assets, moving  allowances,  assistance for  vulnerable groups,  infrastructure, \nadministration, taxes, monitoring and evaluation, and contingencies. The PMO has guaranteed \nto supplement the resettlement budget as may prove necessary to meet any shortfall that \nemerges in achieving the resettlement objectives.  \n ", "62  Appendix 16 \n \nSERVICE QUALITY AND FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE LANZHOU PUBLIC \nTRANSPORT GROUP \n \nA.  Bus Operation and Service Quality \n \n1.  The  Lanzhou  Public  Transport  Group  (LPTG),  owned  by  the  Lanzhou  municipal \ngovernment (LMG), grew from an organization first established in 1953 and reorganized in 2003. \nLPTG operates adequate public transport services to the general public in Lanzhou. LPTG also \nowns hotels, five retail fuel stations, an advertising company, and other enterprises. However, as \nan enterprise owned by LMG, LPTG's primary purpose is providing affordable and efficient \npublic  transport  services  to  the  population  of  Lanzhou.  As  such,  the  profit-making  motive \ncommon in private sector companies is given less emphasis in LPTG's business strategy. \n2.  LPTG possesses 2,089 buses that were 4.5 years old on average in 2009. The buses \nhave 30\u201340 seats and a passenger capacity of 60\u201370. LPTG operates 92 bus routes with a total \nlength of 1,076 kilometers (km) in Lanzhou. The number of passenger trips in 2004 was 346.8 \nmillion, increasing to 540.0 million in 2008. \n3.  Individual private bus operators were operating 99 minibuses on 15 routes without fixed \nbus stops in Lanzhou as of July 2009. These minibuses have capacity for 20 passengers. There \nwere  305  minibuses  owned  by  individual  bus  operators  in  2007,  but  LMG  bought  up  the \nindividual bus companies to consolidate them under LPTG.  \n1.  Bus Fares and Integrated Circuit Cards \n \n4.  Lanzhou  Pricing  Bureau  sets  the  bus  fare,  which  is  currently  CNY1  regardless  of \ndistance. The company does not provide a discount for the elderly, the disabled, students, or \nany other groups. In 2000, LPTG started implementing the integrated circuit card system on \nselected routes. By 2006, some 76 LPTG routes were equipped with integrated circuit card \nequipment. Today all routes and buses are equipped with the integrated circuit card system. The \nintegrated circuit card is a magnetically coded card that contains records of the purchaser\u2019s \nidentification, date of issue, type of card, ridership data as the card is used by the passenger \n(read by the on-bus magnetic card reader), and remaining balance. A security deposit of CNY18 \ncollected from the passenger when the card is issued is refundable when the card is returned. \nThe integrated circuit card is a prepaid card that users can recharge at 16 outlets at bus \nterminals and large shopping centers. Approximately 1.5 million integrated circuit cards are \ncurrently issued. \n5.  The integrated circuit card designates the fare class for the passenger and has made it \npossible to introduce a user-oriented fare structure. The A class card is considered the regular \nclass, with a discount of 15% from the cash fare of CNY1. The B class card is issued to current \nand former state-owned enterprise and government employees with a discount of 25% from the \ncash fare. The C class card is issued to students in elementary to high school with a discount of \n60%, and the D class card carrying a discount of 50% is issued to the unemployed and senior \npassengers.  The  E  class  card  provides  free  transport  to  disabled  military  and  severely \nhandicapped non-military passengers. A and B class cards are not checked for validity, but the \nother class cards are checked annually. Currently about 55% of bus fares are paid using \nintegrated circuit cards. \n \n ", "  Appendix 16  63 \n \n2.  Customer Satisfaction \n6.  According to LPTG officials, the bus company\u2019s service and vehicle quality is better than \nthe average in the People\u2019s Republic of China. LPTG has implemented its own customer \nsatisfaction surveys for vehicle and service quality since 2003. A questionnaire was designed for \nthis purpose with questions covering such areas as waiting time at stations for bus arrival; on-\ntime  departure  and  arrival;  staff  behavior,  appearance,  and  courtesy;  vehicle  cleanliness; \ndisruptive passenger behavior such as smoking, eating, using abusive language, and talking \nloudly; driver adherence to traffic signs, rules, and safety; and the working condition of doors, \nintegrated circuit card readers, and other equipment on the bus. The company recruits 100 \npassengers annually, paying each CNY480 per year to report on 15 routes per month with \nnumerical grades for each question, thereby evaluating 18,000 trips per year.  \n3.  Operating Statistics and Productivity \n \n7.  During the 5-year period from 2004 to 2008, the total route length increased by 0.6% \nannually, from 1,056 km to 1,076 km. The number of LPTG bus routes meanwhile fell from 100 \nto 92 (by 2.1% per year). When the average annual increase of 11.7% in ridership is considered \nfor the same period, it is evident that the reduction in the number of routes has consolidated \nservice with higher efficiency in equipment and employee productivity. For example, average \nannual revenue per bus increased from CNY132,650 in 2004 to CNY210,950 in 2008, for a \n12.3% increase annually; average revenue per passenger increased from CNY0.76 to CNY0.81, \nor 1.6% annually; and average annual passenger trips per employee increased from 48,030 to \n70,710 in 2008, increasing by 10.2% per year.  \n8.  It is projected that, during the 10 years from 2009 to 2018, the total route length will \nincrease by 0.8% annually, from 1,089 km in 2009 to 1,168 km in 2018. The number of bus \nroutes is expected to increase from 92 to 96 as new routes will be added for the planned the \nnew city center, new residential and commercial areas, and BRT. Employee productivity is \nexpected to gradually increase from 3.66 staffers per bus in 2009 to 3.34 staffers per bus in \n2018, and the average number of passenger trips per employee from 74,950 in 2009 to 119,630 \nin 2018. The number of buses in operation is expected to increase from 2,089 in 2009 to 4,495 \nin 2018, while the revenue per passenger is forecast to increase at the same rate of 1.6% per \nannum as in the 2004\u20132008 period.  \n9.  In general, LPTC bus operations indicate an efficiently run operation with relatively high \nemployee productivity, though with some room for improvement. With increasing demand for \npublic passenger transport, additional buses will be needed since fleet utilization is now running \nat 261,630 passengers per bus annually. Even with doubling the fleet size, productivity is \nexpected to increase by 52.8% to 399,830 passengers per bus by 2018. \nB.  Financial Assessment \n \n10.  The audited financial statements of LPTG for 2004\u20132008 have been analyzed. They \ninclude the income statement and cash flow statement for the year and the balance sheet as of \nthe end of the year. The company\u2019s fiscal year coincides with the calendar year.  \n11.  The LPTG bus division shows a consistently positive net operating profit, ranging from \nCNY56.75 million in 2004 (22.3% of revenue) to CNY63.26 million in 2008 (15% of revenue) \nwith the operating ratio (operating expenses divided by operating revenue) ranging from 73.0% \nin 2006 to 85.0% in 2008. The working capital ratio (which deducts depreciation from operating \n ", "64  Appendix 16 \n \nexpenses) ranged from 64.3% in 2006 to 78.1% in 2008, and this also shows strong operating \nperformance by the bus division.  \n12.  When administrative overhead and other non-operating expenses are included, the bus \ndivision\u2019s profitability shows mixed results, with 2004, 2005, and 2008 showing a net loss before \ntax and 2006 and 2007 showing a modest profit. Despite its emphasis on public service, \nhowever, during the 5 years from 2004 to 2008, the cumulative losses for the bus division are \nmore than offset by the cumulative profits, for a total accumulated profit before tax of CNY25.61 \nmillion, or an average of CNY5.12 million per year. \n13.  The financial condition of LPTG would be improved if losses from non-bus divisions were \neliminated through divestiture or if the accounting and financial records of the bus division were \nseparated from the other divisions. The hotel division in particular fails to show a profit, and its \ninclusion as a division of LPTG, which is primarily a bus transport company, is a burden on the \nprofitability of its primary operations.  \n14.  LPTG\u2019s historical current ratio ranged from 0.64 in 2005 to 1.34 in 2008. These ratios are \nlow and reflect liquidity problems in some years, particularly when the quick ratio has fallen \nbelow 1.0, which happened in 4 of the past 5 years. The debt-to-equity ratio during the past 5 \nyears averaged 1.05, showing rough parity between equity and liabilities. Although this ratio \ncould be a concern in relation to the ability of LPTG to borrow further on the strength of its \nbalance sheet, about 65% of the company\u2019s debt is to its parent, LMG, in the form of long-term \nliability resulting from accounting adjustments arising with ownership reform initiated prior to \n2004. This long-term debt could be written off to improve the debt-to-equity ratio substantially. \n15.  During the next 4 years, from 2009 to 2012, LPTG operations are expected to bring \ncumulative losses before tax of CNY52.0 million, or an average of CNY13.0 million annually. \nThese expected losses do not result from the bus division, which is expected to realize a \ncumulative net profit before tax of CNY92.0 million during the same period, or an average of \nCNY23.0 million year. With the commencement of BRT services in 2013, the bus division\u2019s profit \nbefore tax is projected to increase. After 2013, largely because of BRT operations, the bus \ndivision\u2019s profit before tax is expected to offset the losses of the other divisions.  \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:2009112008115508'00'", "Author": "jc9", "ModDate--Text": "D:2009112008115508'00'", "CreationDate--Text": "D:2009112008115508'00'", "Creator": "PrimoPDF http://www.primopdf.com/", "Producer": "PrimoPDF", "ModDate": "D:2009112008115508'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP_Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project 18Nov.doc"}, "author_page": " \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars  \n \nVice-President  C.
