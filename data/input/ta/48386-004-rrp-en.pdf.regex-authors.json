THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan (PBL), and (ii) a proposed project loan to the Republic of Azerbaijan for the \nRailway Sector Development Program. The report also describes (i) proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for Capacity Development and Reform Support for Railway Sector Development, and (ii) \nproposed administration of a project loan to be provided by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD), and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA and the administration of the project loan.1 \n \n2.  The program will provide project financing for the rehabilitation of the track and structure of \nthe Sumgayit\u2013Yalama rail line\u2014a key link in the North\u2013South Railway Corridor within the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation network. It will improve rail network serviceability (the project \nloan);  and  support  the  railway  sector  development  reforms  in  management  autonomy  and \ngovernance, financial restructuring, reporting and control, operational efficiency, and corporate \nrestructuring (the PBL).2 \n \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector development context. There has been a steady decline of railway market share \nin Azerbaijan, as also observed in other countries in the region. Road network expansion and \npipeline network improvements brought competitive pressures onto railways that compounded the \ndifficulties imposed on its infrastructure by the dearth of investment over the years.3 During the \n2000s, following major investments in the oil and gas industry and a related boom in non-tradable \nsectors (construction and real estate), railway sector benefited from growing resource-related \nexports and imports of construction materials and consumer goods. But the market share of rail \ntransport continued to decline. In 2006, at the peak of the economic cycle that Azerbaijan \nexperienced, over 26.5 million tons of goods were transported by railways.4 This volume dropped \nto 22.4 million tons in 2010 and 15.5 million tons in 2016 with the current economic downturn. \n \n4.  Macroeconomic context. With low hydrocarbon prices since mid-2014 and limited new \nopportunities for extracting hydrocarbons, the economy of Azerbaijan\u2014whose foreign trade is \ndominated by oil\u2014is facing macroeconomic difficulties. Two waves of currency devaluation in 2015 \naffected consumers\u2019 purchasing power (especially of imported goods) and the stability of the \nfinance sector (as well as its credit origination capacity).5 Lower hydrocarbon revenues also led to \na contraction in public investments, tightening domestic demand growth. Gross domestic product \ngrowth fell from 2.8% in 2014 to 1.1% in 2015 and \u20133.8% in 2016. To cope with these shocks, the \nauthorities are deploying short-term measures to coordinate monetary, fiscal, and financial stability \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Railway  Sector \nDevelopment Program (TA 9154). \n3  Policy issues were also a deep root contributor to the current situation. For example, the railways sector faces a \nparticular cost-disadvantage vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis the road sector, as no road tolls are paid by users in Azerbaijan. Road \nconstruction and maintenance is 100% paid directly by the Government. \n4  Of these, 54% were oil-related products (exports and transit almost equally split) and 32% were construction materials \n(mostly imports from the north or the south). This is only about one-third of peak rail traffic handled in the past. \n5  Credit to the economy declined sharply by 24% in 2016. Devaluation of the local currency in 2015\u2014with a depreciation \nof over 100%\u2014triggered higher dollarization, with 75.2% of deposits in foreign currency at the end of 2016. This \ncreated a severe shortage of credit.  \n ", "2 \npolicies; 6  and  devising  finance  sector  stability  solutions  to  avoid  further  deterioration  of \nmacroeconomic conditions. \n \n5.  Core development problem. Decades of deteriorating infrastructure and rolling stock, as \nwell as lack of commercial orientation in management and planning decisions, have affected \nrailway service competitiveness and financial viability. Lack of supporting policy and institutional \nmechanisms\u2014the  deep  root  causes  of  the  current  problems\u2014aggravated  the  financial \nperformance of Azerbaijan Railways Closed Joint Stock Company (ADY) over time, and only rising \nindebtedness allowed company operations to continue. 7 The recent steep reduction in freight \ndemand and the level of losses in passenger services have made the heavy legacy (institutional \nand financial) problems at ADY increasingly difficult to manage. With the economic growth decline \nin Azerbaijan, gross expenditure on railway services decreased substantially, exposing the current \nrailway problems. Crucially, while the East\u2013West rail corridor has been under modernization since \n2009,8 railway sector prospects need to be further enhanced on the North\u2013South rail corridor.9 The \nlatter has great potential once the network from Yalama (on Azerbaijan's Russian border) to Astara \n(on the Iranian border) is upgraded, and the planned Rasht\u2013Astara link in Iran is completed.10 \nThese service improvements will enable ADY to capitalize on the country's crossroads location \nand provide safer, more energy-efficient, cheaper, and less road-intensive transport. Nevertheless, \ndeep reforms are crucial for all this to be fiscally sustainable. \n \n6.  ADY management11 and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) face the following challenges:  \n(i)  maintaining deteriorated infrastructure and rolling stock to industry standards to avoid \nimmediate reductions in service competitiveness, while financing key infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and  replacement  investments  to  improve  future  service \ncompetitiveness;  \n(ii)  servicing legacy debt against stagnating free cash flow, while incurring the short-term \ncosts  of  reducing  and  rationalizing  an  oversized  workforce,  to  implement \nproductivity-enhancing changes and afford better compensation levels; and \n(iii)  changing ineffective management information and financial control systems, and \nestablishing  proper  accounting  systems  to  provide  key  financial  information  to \nsupport effective service level and pricing decisions. \n \n7.  Government\u2019s reform agenda. Presidential Decree No. 1138 issued on 6 December 2016 \nestablished a strategic road map on the development of logistics and trade in Azerbaijan. Key \n                                                \n6   In 2016, counter-cyclical fiscal measures were deployed to maintain social expenditure levels to address the short-\nterm impact of the economic recession on vulnerable groups. Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Azerbaijan \nCountercyclical Support Facility. Manila. \n7   ADY, transformed from a government railway department into a government-owned self-accounting closed joint stock \ncompany in 2009, manages the country\u2019s railway network\u2014about 2,096 track route-kilometers (km). Most of ADY\u2019s \nrevenues come from freight; passenger services lose money but are socially important.  \n8   Railway infrastructure modernization on the 503 km East\u2013West railway line is largely financed by the World Bank \nand the \u010cesk\u00e1 exportn\u00ed banka (Czech Export Bank). This forms part of the almost-completed Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Kars \ncorridor, which will provide a direct link from the Caspian countries to Turkey and on to Europe. \n9   The unification of the railways of Azerbaijan, Iran, and the Russian Federation forms part of the International North\u2013\nSouth Transport Corridor\u2014a multimode network of ship, rail, and road routes for moving freight from Northern Europe \nto South and Southeast Asia. \n10  Construction of this link is expected to be launched in 2018 with funding from the governments of Azerbaijan and \nIran. \n11  By September 2015, the government had appointed a new ADY chairperson and new members to the senior \nmanagement team of ADY, empowered to have greater operational and managerial autonomy and report directly to \nthe Cabinet of Ministers (COM).  \n \n ", "3 \nbuilding blocks include a new port complex, free trade zones, the North\u2013South and East\u2013West \nrailways, and a comprehensive set of legal-regulatory reforms in the warehousing and logistics \noperations. The roadmap sets out an integrated vision for how these building blocks can create \nsynergies between the development of a logistics and trading hub in Azerbaijan and the country\u2019s \ncapacity to start attracting foreign direct investment in non-hydrocarbon processing activities. The \ndevelopment of the latter and their competitiveness is now a key priority in the government\u2019s \neconomic  policy.  The government  has  launched  initiatives  to  reform  several  sectors  of the \neconomy, especially those with prominent state-owned enterprises like ADY. Also, as part of \nstructural reform efforts to improve public financial management efficiency and develop a sound \nframework leading the country into a future of fiscal discipline,12 the government has started \naddressing financial management issues and operational and institutional inefficiency issues in \nstate-owned enterprises.13  \n \n8.  A  sustained  policy  implementation  effort  to  engineer  a transition towards  a  less  oil-\ndependent economy is an urgent priority, and railway development can be a crucial enabler of this \nalternative  development  path.  With  railway  infrastructure  installations  in  almost  all  strategic \nlocations of Azerbaijan (border cross points, ports, oil production and agricultural regions), railways \ncompetitiveness can be essential to the country\u2019s production, trade, and distribution of bulk \nmaterials such as agricultural products. However, reform challenges in the sector are urgent. \n \n9.  Need for a sector development program. The development problem summarized above \nurgently  requires  a  comprehensive  policy  and fiscal  response from the government that (i) \npromotes  institutional,  corporate,  financial  management  and  control,  and  labor  and  debt-\nrestructuring reforms; and (ii) makes crucial financing available to upgrade ADY\u2019s service capacity \nand/or  competitiveness.  The  railway  development  challenges  require  properly  sequenced \ninstitutional  and  corporate  reform  actions.  These  reforms  are  crucial  so  that  a  financially \nsustainable outlook for investment financing can help tackle the physical constraints to the freight \nand  passenger  businesses.  The  sector  development  program  modality  enables  multiyear \nassistance to such a sector-focused reform and investment financing agenda.14  \n \n10.  Value addition. The program, included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country \noperations  business  plan  for  Azerbaijan,  2018\u20132020,15 will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  intervention  in \nAzerbaijan\u2019s railways. Dialogue on the program\u2019s design and the assistance began in late 2015.16 \nThe program\u2019s multiyear, programmatic policy loan component supports the government\u2019s reform \nagenda  for  the  railway  sector  and  the  currently-integrated  main  operator.

Forthcoming. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nthe Republic of Azerbaijan Improving Governance and Public Sector Efficiency Program. Manila. There are \ncomplementarities between the forthcoming Improving Governance and Public Sector Efficiency Program (IGPSE) \nand the railway sector development program: while the IGPSE promotes appropriate corporate and financial \ngovernance standards across state-owned enterprises of different sectors, the proposed railways program represents \na sector-focused package of sector, financial, governance, and corporate reforms in railways.  \n14  ADB has undertaken similar initiatives in the past. See for example the Rajasthan Urban Sector Development \nProgram: ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and \nGrant to the Republic of India for the Rajasthan Urban Sector Development Program. Manila. \n15  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Azerbaijan, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n16  ADB approved the program\u2019s concept paper in July 2016, and TA has supported the preparation of reforms and the \nproject design across all outputs. Key aspects of the program have also benefited from past advisory support from \nrailway stakeholders, lessons from past ADB projects, and an ongoing World Bank railway project in Azerbaijan. ADB \nhas ensured that the proposed program reforms complement past TA initiatives by other development partners (in \nsome cases by providing critical leverage). \n ", "4 \ncomponent synergizes infrastructure improvement of Azerbaijan\u2019s East\u2013West and North\u2013South \nrailway corridors to maximize the country\u2019s transit potential. In addition, since ADY\u2019s capacity is \nsignificantly stretched by the wide range of pressing challenges, ADB will allocate TA to facilitate \npolicy dialogue and support implementing further change. This will enhance the coordination with \ndevelopment partners, key ADY stakeholders and other policy makers regarding the challenging \nreform processes. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  will  be  railway  development  for  Azerbaijan  economically  sustained.  The \noutcome will be rail service delivery and financial viability of railway operations in Azerbaijan \nimproved.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The program will have five outputs: the PBL will support reforms under outputs 1\u20134 with \ntwo tranches (tranche 1 includes 23 actions and tranche 2 includes 22 actions); the project loan \nwill support output 5. A more detailed elaboration of the reform outputs summarized below is \nincluded in a dedicated supplementary linked document.17   \n \n13.  Output 1: Enhanced governance, and management and financial autonomy. ADY\u2019s \nnew management team has brought a renewed reform drive to the sector, making the case for the \nneed to enhance ADY\u2019s financial autonomy.18 To strengthen its financial autonomy, ADY was given \nstronger authority in early 2016 to set railway service tariffs. Effective adjustments in the pricing of \nfreight services still require the completion of key accounting and operational upgrades (discussed \nin outputs 3\u20134 below). ADY has undertaken key steps to start addressing the loss-making \nconditions in passenger services. Proposals were submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers (COM) to \nclose profitability gaps through a combination of tariff adjustments, rationalization of service and \nintroduction of public service obligation contracts.  \n \n14.  As a PBL tranche 1 action, ADY\u2019s legal department took leadership in drafting and \nsubmitting to COM a law for railways, introducing, inter alia, an openness to private sector \nparticipation. Approval of this law on railways is a condition for PBL tranche 2 release, as well as \nreforms on the pricing of ADY\u2019s passenger services and the pilot introduction of (i) public service \nobligation contracts in case ADY is mandated to operate routes at a loss, and (ii) performance-\nbased contractual solutions for operational maintenance subsidies. Establishment of a Supervisory \nBoard for ADY and other key corporate governance upgrades are also part of the conditionality of \nPBL tranche 2. As covenanted in the program\u2019s loan agreement, railway sector financing solutions \nwill be mainstreamed from the piloting results before the program completion. \n \n15.  Output 2: Effective financial restructuring of ADY\u2019s debt liabilities. The debt legacy \non the books of ADY cannot be fully serviced by ADY. This over-indebtedness and the related \nconstant financial distress and uncertainty that it produces make it extremely difficult for ADY \nmanagement to plan reforms and implement a financial and business turnaround. The government \nhas committed to shouldering the debt-service obligations connected with ADY\u2019s state-guaranteed \nliabilities until term end. For its remaining debt liabilities, discussions on a three-phase financial \nrestructuring plan began in late 2015 to enable ADY to avoid default. The three-phase plan was \n                                                \n17  Railway Sector Development Program Reform Outputs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n18  Although the government established ADY\u2019s operational and institutional autonomy in 2009, little subsequent reform \noccurred until mid-2015. \n \n ", "5 \nformalized in October 2017.19 MOF and ADY executed the first phase of financial restructuring in \nmid-2017, including restructuring of the debt from commercial creditors,20 and established a \nspecial escrow account (automatically credited with a proportion of ADY\u2019s monthly revenues) for \nthe sole purpose of servicing ADY\u2019s main liabilities in a specific order of priority.21  \n \n16.  Implementation of the second phase of the financial restructuring plan is a PBL tranche 2 \ncondition, together with validation by a reputable third party of the assumptions and financing \nrequirements considered in the original plan. The phased approach in the financial restructuring \nplan enables its implementation and the fiscal support for it to remain intertwined with the \nconditionality proposed.22 This provides an incentivized way of dealing with ADY\u2019s debt legacy \nproblem.  As  covenanted  in  the  program\u2019s  loan  agreement,  the  third phase  of the financial \nrestructuring plan is to be implemented before the program completion. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Improved  financial  and  management  control  and  reporting.  ADY\u2019s \naccounting processes are mostly manual, and the financial reporting that is produced (e.g., \nquarterly management accounts) is not timely. This impairs management decisions. ADY\u2019s current \ncost accounting systems are not useful for analytical purposes (e.g., proper pricing or planning of \nservice  provision  levels)  either.  ADY  is  implementing  a  comprehensive  set  of  financial \nmanagement control and reporting changes (and system upgrades23) to address this fundamental \nhandicap. To enhance financial control, ADY\u2019s ongoing activities under tranche 1 include the \nrevamping of its finance department, centralization of the registry for all contracts, consolidation of \nall bank accounts into a single-ledger bank account, and centralization of all payment-authorization \nresponsibilities with the newly appointed chief financial officer. ADY also established effective \ninternal audit functions. The continuation of these efforts in 2018 will fundamentally upgrade ADY\u2019s \nfinancial management and reduce fiduciary concerns.  \n \n18.  As conditions for tranche 2, ADY will have to establish a risk management system, and \nfinalize the implementation of the integrated financial and management accounting and financial \nreporting and/or control system. This is expected to enable ADY\u2019s financial governance and \nanalytical cost-accounting capacity and cost-recovery pricing. ADY will also have to initiate the \n                                                \n19  With ADB TA support, ADY and MOF estimated the total required fiscal effort to bring ADY to a sustainable debt \nservice coverage ratio by 2020 at $600 million. The financial restructuring plan registers that these fiscal injections \nshould at least be in the form of subordinated loans, with high levels of concessionality in terms (at least 3 years of \ngrace period and 15 years of term). The plan, comprising $200 million for each phase, also articulated the benefits of \nexecuting these injections as new equity, and agreement was reached with ADB to revisit the issue during the \nimplementation of phases 2 and 3, as elaborated in the Railway Sector Development Program Reform Outputs \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). It is expected as a result of the compact of reform and \ninvestment interventions under the program, these improvements can be sustained further and a debt service \ncoverage ratio of 1.2 can be achieved and maintained by 2022 (see related performance indicators in Appendix 1). \n20  In each phase of the plan, ADY and MOF are expected to target the most expensive and short-term liabilities of ADY \nfor either full debt retirement, or renegotiation of terms with the respective creditors (to include the stretching of \nmaturities, lowering of terms, granting of grace periods, and/or waiver of loan covenants in case of loans already in \narrears). Targeted creditors will see a reduction of their net present value and ADY will gradually push forward the \ntime profile of its total debt servicing responsibilities. Ex-ante execution and evaluation of each phase is a policy \ncondition under each tranche release of the PBL. \n21  As a condition for PBL tranche 2, the arrangements of the special escrow account will need to be reviewed, to take \nADY\u2019s liquidity management challenges into account.  \n22  Debt restructuring per se will not have a sustainable impact on the underlying operational profitability of ADY. But the \napproval of a funding plan for the debt restructuring effort that is crucially needed will (a) avoid debt default, and (b) \nenable ADY management to focus on the actual reform agenda that can lift ADY\u2019s business performance. \n23  The implementation of an integrated financial and management accounting and financial reporting system is largely \nsupported under the ongoing Rail Trade and Transport Facilitation Project financed by the World Bank. World Bank. \n2008.  Rail  Trade  and  Transport  Facilitation  Project.  http://projects.worldbank.org/P083108/rail-trade-transport-\nfacilitation?lang=en  \n ", "6 \nprocurement for a credit rating from an international rating agency as a tranche 2 condition. \nPreparation for such an in-depth assessment will generate additional momentum for improvements \nin ADY\u2019s finance department. As covenanted in the program\u2019s loan agreement, ADY is to obtain a \ncredit rating before the program completion. \n \n19.  Output 4: Enhanced operational efficiency and effective corporate restructuring. \nADY approved its organizational/corporate restructuring implementation plan in September 2017. \nIn  addition,  from  the  establishment  of  a  centralized  procurement  department,  to  the  pilot \nintroduction of outsourcing solutions and the elimination of 10 subsidiaries, ADY has started taking \nimportant steps to develop into a more focused, leaner and better performing corporate group. \nADY has also initiated the establishment of effective human resource management functions to \nsupport the preparation and execution of a time-bound (with concrete targets), multi-optional \n(regular and corporate retirement, labor rationalization initiatives, etc.) labor restructuring plan. The \nlatter was approved in October 2017. An open-ledger of operational and non-operational key \nperformance indicators, to be monitored and reported regularly was set up in September 2017. \nThis will set the stage for deeper operational efficiency efforts across the board. ADY\u2019s property \ncommercialization efforts have also made progress from 2016 to September 2017, with ADY\u2019s \nproperty assets inventory and valuation program substantially completed. Submission to COM of \na Business Plan to integrate these business and corporate restructuring efforts within an effective \nstrategy will lock-in commitments going forward. \n \n20.  As a condition for tranche 2, and with support of expert advice, ADY will finalize a \ncomprehensive review of its operational efficiency levels, and build on it to update relevant \noperational key  performance  indicator (KPI) targets going forward.  ADY  will  also  study the \nfeasibility of establishing operational performance auditing requirements, as a condition for tranche \n2. ADY will fully implement an infrastructure traffic planning system (i.e., for time-tabling freight \nand passenger services). A formal and strategic separation of core and non-core assets will take \nplace during PBL tranche 2. ADY will submit commercialization and privatization plans for non-\ncore assets to MOF and the Ministry of Economy, including a proposal to privatize non-core assets \nand expedite improvements in non-core revenue generation.24  \n \n21.  Output 5: Infrastructure of the Sumgayit\u2013Yalama rail line improved. Through this \noutput, the project will rehabilitate about 166 kilometers (km) of double-line main track from \nSumgayit  to  Yalama,  including  civil  structures  and  level  crossings.  Other  existing  facilities, \nincluding signaling, telecommunications, and electrification systems, will continue as at present \nbut with increased maintenance funding. This output will also comprise consulting services to \ndevelop future projects, including a phased strategy for the improvement of other key railway \nassets.  This  includes  electrification,  signaling,  and  telecommunications  to  complete  the \nmodernization of the North\u2013South Railway Corridor from Yalama to Astara.  \n  \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Investment and Financing Plans  \n22.  The PBL will help the government bear the fiscal costs of the policy reforms outlined in the \ngovernment\u2019s development policy letter (Appendix 3) and the policy matrix (Appendix 4). The size \nof the PBL was determined on the basis of (i) the fiscal support required to prepare, implement, \nand monitor the proposed policy actions, including system capacity needs of ADY; and (ii) an \n                                                \n24  As covenanted in the program\u2019s loan agreement, the implementation of the Operations Management System and \nthe labor restructuring plan, and the achievement of operational and non-operational KPI targets remains on schedule \nbefore the completion of the program. \n \n ", "7 \nassessment of the government\u2019s overall fiscal resources and allocation for the railway sector.25  \nThe government has requested a PBL of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and \na policy loan of $75 million from AFD, which is not administered by ADB, in support of the PBL \ncomponent of the program.  \n \n23.  The project component of the program is estimated to cost $325 million (Table 1). The \ngovernment has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the project component. Government counterpart financing for the project component will \nbe $75 million equivalent covering taxes and duties, maintenance of existing signaling and \nelectrification on the project rail line, land acquisition and resettlement, and contingencies. The \ngovernment will provide the loan proceeds and counterpart funds to ADY through a subsidiary \nagreement. AFD is expected to provide a loan of $100 million equivalent to jointly finance the \nproject works contract, and ADB will partially administer the AFD loan by providing services on \nprocurement, safeguards, and review of withdrawal applications. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n25.  PBL tranche 1 policy actions have been completed by the borrower. Tranche 1 is expected \nto be released when loans become effective. Tranche 2 policy actions will be completed as a \ncondition for Tranche 2 release (expected in 2019). ADY has established a program management \noffice (PMO) for the program implementation. The PMO, consisting of a policy support unit and a \nproject implementation unit, will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the program \nincluding  procurement,  financial  management,  loan  covenant  compliance,  support  with  the \nimplementation of the tranche release policy actions under the PBL, and liaison with ADB. \nIncremental operational expenses of the PMO will be financed out of the loan funds to attract \ncompetitive staff. \n \n26.  All procurement financed under the ADB loan and AFD loan partially administered by ADB \nwill follow international competitive bidding procedures pursuant to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time) and will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior review. As AFD is expected \nto cofinance the program and ADB is expected to partially administer the AFD financing of the \nproject component of the program, universal procurement will be applied.26 ADB will recruit the \nconsultants\u2014for the construction supervision and subsequent project development to be financed \nunder the ADB loan\u2014following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the project administration manual (PAM).27 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements  \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2017\u2013December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 \nLoan closing date  30 June 2022 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  The government will establish the program steering committee, to be chaired by the \nminister of MOF and comprising concerned government agencies and ADY, within 3 \nmonths of the loan effectiveness.

The $250 million PBL will be \ndisbursed in two tranches, tranche 1 of $175 million and tranche 2 of $75 million.a \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADY = Azerbaijan Railways Closed Joint Stock Company, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise \nde D\u00e9veloppement, MOF = Ministry of Finance, PBL = policy-based loan, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \na The front-loading of resources in ADB\u2019s PBL is justified by two factors: (i) AFD's approval time line (expected in the \nsecond quarter of 2018) does not allow its policy loan ($75 million) to be disbursed along ADB\u2019s tranche 1; and \n(ii) MOF\u2019s direct fiscal outlays in 2017 into ADY, as a result of tranche 1 conditionalities, have been substantial. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n27.  The proposed transaction TA will support capacity development and reforms at ADY, \nfocusing on outputs 1\u20134 with certain support for output 5. The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, \nof which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources). The government through ADY will provide counterpart support in the form \nof counterpart staff, office space, workshop venues, and other in-kind contributions. ADY will be \nthe  executing  agency for the TA,  which  will  be  implemented  over  3 years  during  program \nimplementation.28 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n28.  The  project  design  compared  various  rehabilitation  options  and  considered  track \nrehabilitation most appropriate given the traffic characteristics, service condition of railway systems, \nand competing demands for limited funds among railway assets. Comprehensive track renewal of \nthe rail line will enable the commercial speed for freight to be restored from an average of 25 km \nper hour to 60 km per hour.  \n \n29.  The  project  activity  qualifies  as  climate  mitigation  as  it  promotes  the  reduction  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions by a modal shift to a low-carbon transport mode. Climate change risk \nfactors in the project area include sea level rise, rising temperatures, and increased frequency and \nmagnitude of flooding caused by increased intensity of single rainfall events. The project will \nincorporate climate-proofing design in the track rehabilitation, including continuous welded rails \nand improved drainages.   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n30.  Economic viability. ADB carried out an economic analysis of the project loan, comparing \nthe incremental changes in costs and benefits arising from the project against a without-project \nscenario that assumes continued and gradual deterioration of the railway link between Sumgayit \nand Yalama.29  The current and forecast traffic with and without the project was assessed based \non detailed data provided by ADY; an analysis of prospective flows on the North\u2013South Transport \nCorridor; an analysis of international trade traffic data (from statistics provided by the United \nNations, European Union, Commonwealth of Independent States, and other countries); and \nthrough the comparison of alternative routes. The main economic benefits are (i) time savings for \nfreight traffic and passengers; (ii) vehicle operating cost savings; (iii) reduced externalities (carbon \n                                                \n28  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29  ADB conducted the analysis based on ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "10 \ndioxide emissions and safety); and (iv) infrastructure maintenance cost savings. The project is \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 12.4% and a net present value of \n$118.6 million at a 9.0% discount rate.  \n \n31.  Financial viability. To ascertain the project\u2019s financial viability, ADB conducted a financial \nanalysis of the project30  on an incremental basis to compare cash flow with and without the project. \nThe financial internal rate of return is 6.7%, exceeding the calculated weighted average cost of \ncapital of 2.3%. The project remains economically and financially viable against key variables, \nincluding a capital cost increase of 20% and traffic reduced by 20%.  \n \n32.  Financial sustainability of ADY. The PBL component of the program will strengthen the \nfinancial capacity of ADY and the government to implement the project. Assuming a gradual \nphasing-in of the financial benefits to be realized from implementation of reform measures through \ndelivery of 4 PBL outputs, ADY\u2019s operating income will grow faster than that of the no-reform \nscenario, which will be critical for ADY to remain a going concern, averting default situation,31 and \ncome back to a financially sustainable level of service delivery competitiveness.32  \n \nC.  Governance  \n33.  ADY\u2019s financial management and reporting systems need strengthening. ADY is on track \nto begin operation of its integrated financial and management accounting, and financial reporting \nand control system, in early 2018. Under the project loan, direct payments for large contracts will \nbe used. An advance account will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, and all \npayments to contractors and consultants below a certain threshold will be made from the account \nwith the endorsement of responsible senior staff in ADY and MOF. Overall financial management \nrisk is considered substantial before the mitigation measures and moderate afterward.33 ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  ADY.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 27). \n  \nD.  Poverty and Social \n34.  Azerbaijan has made significant progress in reducing poverty. But the developments in \nemployment growth and poverty reduction have largely been skewed in favor of Baku instead of \nrural  areas  and  non-Baku  urban  areas.  The  government\u2019s  various  poverty  reduction  and \ndevelopment programs now emphasize, among others, inclusive growth, poverty reduction, and \ninfrastructure  development.  The  project  will  improve  the  rail  network  efficiency  and  reduce \ntransport costs and travel time, bringing a positive impact on poverty alleviation for rural areas and \nnon-Baku urban areas along the project railway. The primary beneficiaries will be passengers and \nfreight transporters, including mobile vendors, shippers, freight transporters, and producers.  \n \n                                                \n30  In accordance with ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n31  Debt default would shut down ADY\u2019s access to private credit markets\u2014for formal finance and operational trade credit \n\u2014 in the foreseeable future, and imply Government direct funding of every single capital replacement item going \nforward. The soft-budget constrains regime of the past would likely set in again, and the fiscal cost of this railway \nsector scenario would be augmented by such circumstances. \n32  Financial (Fiscal) Impact Assessment of Railway Sector Reforms (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n33  The bidding documents for the works contract will include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit all project records \nand accounts, as well as those of all contractors, suppliers, and other service providers as they relate to the project. \nKey measures to ensure proper governance are (i) independent external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and \nfinancial statements; (ii) transparent decision processes for all procurement matters; and (iii) verification of \ncontractors\u2019 payment claims by the supervision consultant and oversight by the project implementation agency. \n ", "11 \n35.  Gender. The project loan is classified some gender elements. It is expected to bring certain \nbenefits to women, including reduced travel time and easy access to public and business facilities, \nadditional employment opportunities, and improved railway safety from the reconstruction of \noverpasses and bridges, installation of safety fences and lighting, rest areas with separate toilets \nfor men and women, and a community safety awareness campaign. Advertisements for project-\nrelated jobs will include that women are encouraged to apply. ADY will implement a skills \ndevelopment program under the PBL, and ensure 30% participation by women. ADY will also \ndesign a new pricing strategy for passenger services that incorporates measures to mitigate any \npotential negative impact on the poor, women, children, and the elderly. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n36.  Social safeguards. The project loan is classified category B for involuntary resettlement \nand category C for indigenous peoples. Meaningful public consultations were conducted and a \ndraft land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP)34 was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 5 October 2017. ADY has \noverall  responsibility  for  LARP  finalization  and  implementation.  It  has  adequate  institutional \ncapacity and is committed to managing social safeguard compliance. The construction supervision \nconsultant will monitor LARP implementation. The PMO will ensure the project complies with social \nsafeguards loan covenants, including semiannual social safeguard monitoring reporting. No land \nacquisition and resettlement impact is expected for the PBL.35 \n \n37.  Environmental safeguards. The project loan is classified category B for environmental \nsafeguards.  Meaningful  public  consultations  were  conducted  and  an  initial  environmental \nexamination was prepared in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and disclosed on \nADB\u2019s website on 7 November 2017. Project impacts during construction are expected to be site-\nspecific, temporary, and related to the direct replacement of track, such as noise in residential \nareas, dust and exhaust emissions from equipment, impacts of bridge rehabilitation on the crossing \nrivers, and waste management. During operations, potential noise and vibration impacts are \nexpected from the increased train speed and frequency after track improvement. The project will \nimprove railway safety by fencing along the whole alignment. An environmental management plan \nprovides mitigation and monitoring measures, as well as a capacity building plan for the PMO and \nADY. Contractors will be responsible for implementing the mitigation measures. The loan has \nallocated funds for institutional strengthening, including safeguard compliance and railway safety \nimprovement. The PMO will ensure the project complies with the environmental loan covenants, \nincluding semiannual environmental monitoring reporting. No environmental impact is expected \nfor the PBL (footnote 35). \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  Risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan. This includes financial management risks. Table 4 summarizes major risks \noutside project control.36 Overall, risks are deemed manageable through mitigating measures. \nBenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \n                                                \n34  Five households (20 persons) will have land acquisition and resettlement impacts. All five affected households will \nbe severely impacted by losing more than 10% of their productive assets.
