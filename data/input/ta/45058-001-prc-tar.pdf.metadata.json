INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the December 2010 country programming mission, consultations between the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhighlighted the need to provide support for promoting knowledge sharing and cooperation to \nenhance the development impact of ADB operations in the country. The government requested \nADB  to  provide  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  promote  partnerships  for  South\u2013South \ncooperation.1 The TA is included in the PRC\u2019s country operations business plan, 2011\u20132013 as \na firm TA.2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The unprecedented economic expansion of the PRC over the past decade has placed \nthe country in a position to play a critical role in development in the Asia and Pacific region. The \nPRC  recognizes  the  increasing  global  and  regional  expectations  for  it  to  share  in  the \ndevelopment of the region. The breadth and depth of the PRC\u2019s development experience and \nknowledge  is  valuable  for  other  developing  countries.  The  PRC  can  also  learn  from  the \ndevelopmental lessons of other countries and build on their successes.  \n \n3.  Since 2006, ADB\u2019s East Asia Department has made efforts to integrate knowledge \nmanagement into its operations in the PRC. The department has placed increased emphasis on \ngenerating knowledge from lending and technical assistance operations, and providing policy-\nrelated knowledge support. It has also strengthened knowledge cooperation with the PRC on a \nnumber of dimensions, taking full advantage of the PRC\u2019s development experience. Knowledge \nand innovation is a core theme in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC4. The PRC, in \npartnership  with  ADB,  has  found  a  long-term  solution  to  make  the  knowledge  exchange \nsustainable. A formalized knowledge sharing platform (KSP) would serve as a channel for \nexchanging  good  development  practices,  facilitating  learning  between  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs) and the PRC, and ultimately building greater South\u2013South cooperation. \n \n4.  To promote South\u2013South cooperation, the PRC Ministry of Finance (MOF) and ADB \nestablished a KSP in 2009. This jointly managed KSP is a vehicle to (i) share solutions for key \nemerging development issues and challenges faced by developing countries in the Asia and \nPacific region, (ii) contribute to sound development management and policy making, and (iii) \npromote regionally inclusive development. It supports ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework, \nStrategy 2020,5 to drive knowledge solutions as a tool to help countries attain their development \nobjectives. It also aligns the knowledge sharing objectives of the PRC and ADB by creating \nlearning opportunities that build on their key strengths. ADB plays the role of facilitator to \npromote evidence-based learning between the PRC and other ADB DMCs and contributes to \nthe conceptualization, design, and financing of KSP activities. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  South-South cooperation is economic cooperation among developing countries aimed at closer policy coordination \nand collaboration in support of regional and global public goods, accelerating economic growth and reducing \neconomic disparities. \n2  ADB. 2011.

The KSP has evolved into a multi-year umbrella for sector-driven knowledge sharing \ninitiatives, including regional ones. It facilitates dialogue and knowledge exchange between the \nPRC and other countries in the region. Activities under the KSP include (i) annual thematic \nworkshops in the PRC, attended by officials from the PRC and DMCs; (ii) development-related \ncase studies and reports shared in these workshops and published on the websites of ADB and \nits partners; (iii) presentations by resource persons from the PRC, DMCs, and ADB on thematic \ntopics and case studies from their countries; and (iv) site visits that showcase development \nprojects in the PRC. Since 2009, three KSP events have been organized: \n(i)  The  High-Level  Regional  Knowledge-Sharing  Workshop  on  Sustainable \nUrbanization was held in Shanghai, 2\u20136 November 2009. It was attended by 50 \nsenior officials from 11 DMCs and discussions focused on (a) sound urbanization \nstrategies, (b) good practices and common challenges in urban planning, (c) \nurban renewal and expansion, and (d) urban finance. \n(ii)  The  High-Level  Regional  Knowledge-Sharing  Workshop  on  Transport \nInfrastructure: An Instrument for Economic and Social Development was held in \nBeijing, 8\u201311 November 2010. It was attended by 70 officials from 15 DMCs and \ndiscussions  focused  on  (a)  the  role  of  transport  infrastructure  in  promoting \neconomic and social development, (b) strategies for road network development \nand planning of road infrastructure, (c) financing of transport infrastructure, (d) \ninstitutional  capacity  building  to  support  high  performance  in  transport \ninfrastructure development and operation, and  (e) addressing adverse impacts \nof transport infrastructure and its contribution to poverty reduction.  \n(iii)  The High-Level Regional Knowledge-Sharing Workshop on Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment was held in Beijing, 7\u201310 November 2011. It was attended by 70 \nofficials from 15 DMCs and discussions focused on (a) best practices in farm \nproductivity to boost farmers' incomes, (b) agriculture research, (c) green rural \ninfrastructure, and (d) rural financial development.   \n \n6.  The KSP was showcased as a model South\u2013South learning initiative at the High-Level \nForum on Aid Effectiveness held on 29 November\u20131 December 2011 in Busan, Republic of \nKorea. \n \n7.  ADB  has  been  actively  exploring  knowledge  partnerships  with  PRC\u2019s  centers  of \nexcellence to expand mutual learning experiences between the PRC and other DMCs in urban \ndevelopment, transport sector, water security, and agriculture and rural development. In March \n2010, the PRC urban knowledge hub was established with Tongji University in Shanghai. It is a \npioneering initiative made possible through the partnership between ADB and Tongji University \nfor sharing good practice approaches in urban planning. In 2011, ADB established a knowledge \npartnership jointly with the Tsinghua University, Peking University, and the Asia-Pacific Center \nfor Water Security covering the water sector. Preparations for the establishment of the PRC \ntransport knowledge hub are under way; it aims to realign transport work in the region to be \nconsistent with emerging transport challenges by developing sustainable road or rail networks. \nThe PRC agriculture knowledge hub is also being conceptualized. \n \n8.  The  KSP  has  been  a  successful  country-led  platform  for  sharing  experiences  in \naddressing challenges in the urban, transport, and agriculture sectors. The KSP addresses \nseveral aspects of the Accra Agenda for Action, which serves as the frame of reference for the \ntask team for South\u2013South cooperation, including (i) ownership and mutual accountability, (ii) \naddressing  development  challenges,  (iii)  champions  and  incentives,  and  (iv)  triangular \ncooperation.  \n \n ", "  3\n9.  The  KSP  is  an  equitable  and  participatory  approach  that  enhances  ownership  and \neffectiveness of development knowledge sharing. It raises awareness on the emerging needs \nand challenges in the region through a more systematic and structured channel for South\u2013South \ncooperation. Through the KSP, the PRC takes on a leadership role in equal partnership with \nADB in sharing its development experience with DMCs in the region. \n \n10.  Initial KSP activities have produced good results. Participants successfully shared best \npractices  and  emerging  issues  and  challenges  in  urban  development  and  transport  as \ninstruments  of  socioeconomic  development.  Based  on  the  post-workshop  evaluations \nconducted,  participants  valued  the  knowledge-sharing  workshops  as  effective  networking \nvehicles for policy makers that pave the way for future South\u2013South cooperation initiatives. The \nknowledge-sharing workshop on urbanization led to collaboration between ADB and the College \nof Architecture and Urban Planning of Tongji University to establish the urban knowledge hub to \ncontinue  to  share  urban  best  practices  within  the  PRC  and  with  other  DMCs.  Participant \nfeedback included suggestions to hold KSP activities in other DMCs. \n \n11.  The MOF and ADB are now working to position the KSP as a credible and influential \nsource of development knowledge in the region. The KSP has the potential to facilitate regional \ncooperation and policy dialogue for regional cooperation around specific sector topics. With \ngreater resources and effort, it can achieve that potential by serving as a platform to assist \nexchanges between countries. The KSP is envisaged to become an umbrella for other sector \nactivities, particularly regional ones, in order to address similar and shared challenges between \ncountries  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.  The  KSP  model  may  be  enriched  by  piloting \nsubsequent  workshops  in  other  DMCs  and  rotating  the  host  country  to  learn  from  the \ndevelopment achievements and experience of other developing countries. \n \n12.  Given the KSP\u2019s unique role as a knowledge broker in the region, the PRC and ADB are \nwell placed to use it to support South\u2013South cooperation so that this knowledge may translate \nto relevant projects with meaningful impacts on people\u2019s lives. As its facilitator, ADB is in the \nbest position to evolve the KSP-led dialogue into high-impact policy recommendations and \noutcomes for all participants. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced knowledge cooperation between the PRC and \nother  DMCs.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  increased  awareness  of  best  practices  and \nemerging issues and challenges in the region, enabling improved sector policy making and \ncapacity building among the PRC and DMCs in the region. Success in achieving the outcome \nwill be measured by (i) the increased participation of DMCs in knowledge sharing workshops \nwith the PRC and (ii) the improved satisfaction of participants in knowledge sharing workshops. \nThe main outputs of the TA are (i) KSP workshops on development themes, (ii) papers prepared \nfor the workshops, and (iii) publications on results of the workshops. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  Using  the  KSP,  the  TA  will  carry  out  knowledge-sharing  activities  covering  key \ndevelopment constraints and challenges facing the PRC and other DMCs in key sectors and \nthemes, as well as opportunities for inclusive, balanced, and sustainable development. Specific \ndevelopment issues that are likely to be covered by KSP workshops, publications, and policy \n ", "4    \npapers include (i) constraints facing the transition of middle-income economies to higher-income \neconomies; (ii) international lessons on human capital development and capacity building; (iii) \nsuccess stories on the provision of basic social services; (iv) urbanization; (v) economics of \nclimate  change  and  low-carbon  growth  strategies;  (vi)  fiscal  management,  and  the  use  of \nnatural  resources;  and  (vii)  environmental  management  practices.  The  TA  will  promote \nhorizontal  learning  and  knowledge  exchange,  identify  development  needs,  and  encourage \nenhanced knowledge partnerships. \n \n15.  Key activities to promote South\u2013South cooperation through the KSP platform include (i) \nholding international workshops, conferences, field visits, and study tours to facilitate knowledge \nexchange; (ii) sharing the outputs of the workshops, field visits, and study tours with participants \nand other stakeholders by disseminating reports; and (iii) developing and publishing policy \ndocuments and posting these on a KSP website. The KSP will become an umbrella for sector \nactivities\u2014particularly those of regional nature such as the ADB\u2013PRC urban knowledge hub.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). The government will \nprovide an in-kind contribution through the provision of counterpart staff, office space and \nutilities, transport, and other support activities, including access to data. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.   The MOF, as the executing agency, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring \nTA activities. A steering committee\u2014comprising representatives of departments of the MOF and \nADB\u2014will be set up to oversee implementation, and provide guidance and direction to the \nconsultants. The composition of the steering committee will be finalized at TA inception. In \naddition, the MOF will appoint a project coordinator who will supervise and coordinate day-to-\nday TA activities, including monitoring progress, resolving problems, arranging meetings, and \nliaising with concerned government agencies. To facilitate the work of the consultants and \nensure that the MOF benefits from their experience, the MOF will provide adequate counterpart \nstaff with relevant work experience during TA implementation. The steering committee will \nprovide guidance on organizing programs, workshops, and seminars; selecting participants; and \nidentifying  topics  for  workshops,  and  other  TA  activities.  A  workshop  coordinator  may  be \nrecruited to support the organization of the workshop.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from 31 January 2012 to 31 December 2015. It will \nrequire  about  8  person-months  of  international  and  about  12  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services to carry out the terms of reference (Appendix 3). The international and \nnational consultants will have expertise in (i) training and capacity building, (ii) institutional \ndevelopment,  (iii)  economic  policy  making,  (iv)  social  development,  (v)  environmental \nmanagement  issues,  and  (vi)  regional  cooperation.  Workshop  coordinators  may  be \nappointed after discussions with the steering committee. The steering committee will discuss \nand finalize the required expertise and detailed terms of reference for specific assignments, \nincluding  duration  and  expected  results.  Additional  international  and  national  resource \npersons and short-term task-specific experts will be recruited to carry out well-defined tasks \n(e.g., preparing case study papers, creating workshop presentations, presenting papers in \nworkshops, and reviewing draft reports).  \n \n ", "  5\n19.  All  consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The consultants \nwill be recruited on an individual basis since varied expertise will be required for the short-term \nengagement, the main requirements of the assignments are for individual qualifications and \nexperience, and the assignments are more on an individual basis. A firm could have difficulty \nproviding multidisciplinary expertise over the 3-year implementation period as required by the \nTA. The workshop coordinators will be responsible for team coordination and leadership work. \nResource  persons  will  be  subject  to  the  limitations  with  regard  to  the  recruitment  and \ncompensation of resource persons under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). Given the nature of the TA and to facilitate preparation and \nimplementation of the training and workshops, ADB may establish an advance payment facility \nas needed and/or utilize direct payment to workshop sponsors and workshop venues. Proceeds \nof  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Promoting Partnerships for South\u2013South \nCooperation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting   \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nEnhanced knowledge  Increased number of  ADB operational data   Increased ADB \ncooperation between the  knowledge products and    involvement in \nPRC and other DMCs   policy papers prepared    developmental activities \nby 2018       for the PRC\u2019s 12th Five-\n    Year Plan \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased awareness of  Increased participation  ADB operational data   Government\u2019s \nbest practices and  of DMCs in knowledge    commitment to promote \nemerging issues and  sharing workshops with  Client survey and  knowledge sharing \nchallenges among the  the PRC by 2015  feedback   \nPRC and DMCs in the      Knowledge sharing \nregion   Improved satisfaction of  activities are well \n  participants in  organized \nknowledge sharing   \nworkshops by 2015 \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
