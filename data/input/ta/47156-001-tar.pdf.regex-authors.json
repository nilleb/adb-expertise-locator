The Asian Development Outlook 2013 published by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nestimates that Asia will grow at 6.7% in 2014,1 yet trends have shown that the benefits of high \ngrowth have not been evenly spread across society. Ensuring inclusive and sustainable growth \nis a strategic agenda for ADB, and a policy priority for many ADB developing member countries \n(DMCs).  Experience  has  shown  that  centralized,  top\u2013down  approaches  often  make  local \ncitizens passive recipients in the development process, resulting in weak service delivery partly \ncaused by a lack of accountability by service providers.  \n \n2.  This  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  knowledge  generation  for  and \ncapacity  building  in  the  DMCs  on  community-driven  development  (CDD)  approaches.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 CDD gives control over planning decisions \nand investment resources to community groups and local governments.3 A 2009 study showed \nthat CDD (i) results in more cost-effective delivery of international development partners\u2019 funding \nfor a broad range of infrastructure and other community projects; (ii) is more responsive to local \ncommunity  infrastructure  demands,  generating  increased  benefits;  (iii)  instills  a  sense  of \nownership that translates to better operation and maintenance, and increased sustainability; (iv) \nprovides a fund disbursement mechanism that promotes transparency and limits leakages; and \n(v) results in projects with higher rates of return than other ADB-financed projects.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Building on the results of two previous CDD TA projects,5 this TA will address the \nfollowing  issues:  (i)  weak  coordination  among  sector  agencies  to  deliver  basic  services \neffectively in response to local development needs, (ii) limited knowledge of DMC officials on \nhow to design CDD projects and programs appropriate to the country context, and (iii) lack of \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure that can improve basic service \ndelivery at the local level.  \n \n4.  A 2013 report on five CDD projects observed that local governments are usually chosen \nas the sustaining agent of CDD projects.6 However, local service provision is often constrained \nby  unclear  and  overlapping  responsibilities  across  tiers  of  government,  fragmentation  of \nfunctions at the local government level, and constraints in fiscal arrangements between national \nand local governments. Experience has shown that once a CDD platform is established at the \nlocal level, it can be used for multiple objectives, such as (i) infrastructure and basic service \ndelivery, (ii) livelihood opportunities, (iii) climate adaptation and disaster risk management, and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Asian Development Outlook 2013. Manila. \n2   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 October 2013. \n3  The study defines community-driven development (CDD) as having the following five features: (i) community focus, \n(ii)  participatory  planning  and  design,  (iii)  community  control  of  resources,  (iv)  community  involvement  in \nimplementation, and (v) community-based monitoring and evaluation. \n4  ADB. 2009.

Examples of small-scale infrastructure are rural roads, water \nsupply systems, sanitation facilities, community irrigation systems, postharvest facilities, classrooms, day care \ncenters, and health stations. Also included are non-infrastructure investments such as microlending, training, and \nother forms of community investment. \n5   ADB.  2007.

Both \ntechnical completion reports were rated satisfactory.  \n6   ADB. 2013. Sharing Knowledge on Community-Driven Development in Asia and the Pacific.

However, such an integrated approach requires \nimproved coordination among sector agencies, local governments, communities, and other local \nstakeholders.7 This is based on the increased recognition that institutionalizing CDD approaches \ninto a broader system of decentralized governance requires the up-front involvement of local \ngovernments as co-producers of local development\u2014a reversal of earlier CDD approaches that \ncreated parallel service delivery structures to bypass local governments.  \n \n5.  DMCs are at varying stages of readiness to apply CDD approaches in project operations, \nranging from expressed interest to national scale-up. Indonesia and the Philippines, for example, \nhave accumulated experience in the implementation of large-scale CDD programs. Several \nDMCs have either pilot tested CDD elements or integrated these as components of larger \nprojects, while others are keen to adopt CDD approaches but have yet to begin implementation. \nThe  designs  of  CDD  projects  differ  with  regard  to  geographic  scope,  time  frames, \nimplementation  arrangements,  subproject  selection  mechanisms,  funding  flows,  roles  of \nsecondary agents (i.e., national and local government and civil society organizations), and \nforms of the community decision-making processes. The need for local development varies from \ncommunity to community and country to country, requiring a flexible approach tailored to local \ncircumstances.  \n \n6.   Since late 1990s, vast resources have been invested globally in ICT to improve ways to \nmanage and deliver projects, and improve access by bringing services closer to beneficiaries. \nDuring the ICT for Development Forum 2013, ADB recognized the importance of ICT as a tool \nto  promote  and  enable  inclusive  and  sustainable  development.  With  the  rapid  growth  of \ninvestment in mobile communication, an increasing number of poor, particularly the rural poor \nand those living in geographically isolated communities, are connected through mobile and \nsmart phones, and for some, through internet access. ICT has the potential to improve the \nquality of basic services to these far-flung, isolated communities by virtually connecting them to \naffordable  education,  health,  agriculture,  commerce,  finance,  and  government  services  to \ncomplement the facility and services provided through CDD projects.8 \n \n7.  Some DMCs have initiatives to provide information on commodity prices prevailing in \nurban markets to small farmers and other rural producers.9 These fledgling efforts can be \nstrengthened and taken further to develop virtual marketplaces to facilitate trade. In the health \ncare sector, village health workers can be assisted in the diagnosis of patient needs right at their \nhomes, through the use of dedicated algorithms transmitted via cell phone short messaging \nservices that will enable nurses or other para-professionals based at village health centers and, \nif necessary, doctors in municipal clinics to provide diagnostic input and advice.  \n                                                \n7  H.  Binswanger-Mkhize,  J.P.  de  Regt,  and  S.  Spector,  eds.  2009.  Scaling  Up  Local  &  Community  Driven \nDevelopment (LCDD): A Real World Guide to Its Theory and Practice. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n8  ICT tools may also enhance implementation of a CDD project through the use of a web-based ICT platform or \ndashboard accessed through smartphones that will allow CDD fieldworkers to seek quick guidance from multiple \ncolleagues at once on the handling of difficult situations during implementation. The ICT platform or dashboard can \nalso function as a management system to store lessons that can improve CDD project implementation and further, \nas an e-marketplace-cum-repository of community project proposals seeking potential development partners. \n9  Examples of ICT initiatives supporting CDD include: (i) application of community-based e-services to improve the \nservice quality of village health centers and education facilities; (ii) use of e-government kiosks to improve local \ngovernment services or coordinate multiple development interventions from different sector agencies; and (iii) \nestablishment  of  telecenters  (i.e.,  internet  access  centers)  to  enable  online  searches  for  jobs  or  training \nopportunities to improve livelihoods in the poorest CDD targeted municipalities. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be increased application of CDD approaches in selected DMCs. \nThe outcome will be increased knowledge and capacity of participating DMCs in using CDD \napproaches.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  In  response  to  growing  DMC  demand  for  CDD  knowledge  solutions,  the  TA  will \n(i) produce analytical work on CDD approaches to support the agenda of inclusive growth; \n(ii) conduct cross-country learning exchanges on CDD approaches to contribute to building the \ncapacity of selected DMCs; and (iii) identify ICT initiatives to improve basic service delivery at \nthe local level. The knowledge generated through this TA will assist DMCs to guide the CDD \nand ICT approaches. Outputs will be widely shared. \n \n10.  Output  1:  Analytical  work  on  community-driven  development  approaches \nproduced. Analytical work will be conducted to better understand the dynamics of local level \nresponses to multisectoral interventions at the community level. In addition to the desk review of \nexisting studies (footnote 6),  impact evaluations, and case studies, the analytical work will \nidentify  communities  to  hold  focus  group  discussions  and  small  surveys  to  analyze  the \nexperience of knowledge partners in Indonesia and the Philippines who have scaled up CDD \noperations  as  part  of  their  inclusive  growth  strategy.10 The  analytical  work  will  review  the \nindividual functions and institutional relationships between the community, local government, \ncentral  government  sector  agencies,  and  private  sector  organizations  involved  in  pro-poor \ninterventions, to assess complementarity and synergies of various poverty reduction projects at \nthe community level, and the responses of the community. Several dimensions of these multiple \ninterventions will be studied, such as the influence of CDD participatory planning and decision-\nmaking  processes  on  the  interventions  of  sector  agencies;  contributions  of  CDD-built \ninfrastructure to improved basic service delivery and livelihood opportunities; how social capital \nstrengthened through CDD processes has been translated into economic capital and increased \nlocal economic activities; and others.  \n \n11.  The analytical work will also identify institutional constraints faced by the CDD projects \nbefore and during implementation, particularly in the early stages. Identification of institutional \nconstraints, and how these were addressed, will be of great value to other DMCs with different \npolitical, intergovernmental, and local government setups. These field findings will be used to \nidentify potential entry points for introducing CDD approaches into ADB operations, as well as \nthe basic prerequisites for the readiness of DMCs to adopt CDD, including fiduciary frameworks \nand community-level capacity.11  \n \n12.  Output  2:  Cross-country  learning  exchanges  promote  community-driven \ndevelopment approaches. This component will focus on cross-country learning exchanges \n                                                \n10 S. Wong. 2012. What  Have  Been  the Impacts  of World  Bank  Community-Driven Development  Programs? \nWashington, DC: World Bank.; see also footnote 6. Case studies to be undertaken will be selected from ADB\u2019s \nongoing or proposed CDD projects so that the specific lessons learned can have immediate applicability to improve \nADB project operations. \n11 The analysis will include fund flow mechanisms that will be efficiently and effectively used for the intended purpose, \ntaking into consideration vulnerability to corruption. A tool kit or checklist that would serve as reference to \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) interested in the CDD approach will be produced. \n ", "4  \nbetween Indonesian and Philippine knowledge partners who are considered advanced in the \nuse of CDD approaches, and other DMCs in the region that have expressed interest in CDD. \nUsing predetermined selection criteria (including the applicability of the TA activities to ongoing \nor  planned  ADB  projects)12 and  in  consultation  with  the  regional  departments,  three  DMC \nprojects\u2014each with strong community-based features\u2014have been selected to participate in this \ncomponent. The three projects are either starting up or are ongoing. The DMC projects that will \nbe included within this output are (i) the Coastal Towns Infrastructure Improvement Project in \nBangladesh, (ii) the North Pacific Economic and Public Financial Management in the Federated \nStates of Micronesia, and (iii) the Building Climate Resilience in the Pyanj River Basin Project in \nTajikistan.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  community-based  features  of  the  selected  projects \nthrough  peer-to-peer  learning  exchanges  and  technical  inputs  from  the  CDD  international \nconsultant. Through this output, the TA will also build the capacity of participating DMCs in \ndesigning  projects  with  CDD  features  that  fit  the  country  context.  Regional  conferences, \nworkshops,  and  other  similar  learning  activities  will  be  organized to  share knowledge  and \nexperience with other DMCs and CDD practitioners in Asia and the Pacific.   \n \n13.  Output 3: Information and communication technology initiatives supporting CDD \nidentified. This component will explore ICT initiatives that will complement CDD projects in the \nselected DMCs. To ensure that the potential ICT initiative will have strong links with ADB \noperations, two projects will be selected from among the DMC countries or projects with CDD \nfeatures that participated in components 1 and 2. The selection will be based on the needs \nidentified by ADB team leaders, executing agencies, and implementing agencies for extending \ne-operations as the pilot cases. The TA will produce two ICT country studies on potential \ncommunity-based e-service to expand the project reach and/or provide improved services to \nremote beneficiaries.  \n \n14.  The three outputs of the TA are designed to be mutually reinforcing. The analytical work \nof output 1 on the dynamics of multiple pro-poor programs on the ground will feed into output 2, \nserving as inputs to the three DMCs that will be assisted in enhancing the CDD features of their \nprojects.  DMCs  participating  in  output  2  will  also  receive  technical  inputs from knowledge \npartners  in  Indonesia  and  the  Philippines  through  cross-country  learning  exchanges, \nconferences, workshops, and other learning activities. Two DMCs participating in outputs 1 and \n2 will receive further assistance to identify ICT tools to complement CDD project implementation \nby improving access to basic services delivery at the local level.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent, of which, $200,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013V), and $500,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund \nand administered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. In-kind government inputs \nare expected in the form of information provision, collaboration on the design of CDD initiatives, \nand meeting participation. \n \n                                                \n12 Includes DMC or project selection criteria, DMC\u2019s potential interest on CDD, ADB\u2019s current involvement in CDD-\nrelated policy dialogue and investment, projects at an early stage of preparation or implementation, small projects \nor small components of a big project, and potential for scaling up the pilot-tested approach to ADB operations. \nGovernment concurrence will be sought during TA implementation. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA duration is 2 years beginning February 2014. Government departments13 in \nIndonesia  and  the  Philippines  will  be  tapped  as  knowledge  partners  for  three  national \nworkshops in Bangladesh, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Tajikistan;  and two regional \nworkshops in Indonesia and the Philippines. ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment will be the executing agency, and will work closely with the respective team leaders \nin regional departments providing supporting, advisory, and coordinating roles. ADB staff may \nserve as resource persons in these workshops, and provide administrative or secretarial support \nservices for the implementation of regional training activities.  \n \n17.  Consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The project requires a total of \n14  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  40  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services. The team will consist of (i) one international consultant with experience in \ndesigning and implementing CDD programs and projects in Asia and the Pacific (7 person-\nmonths); various international consultants with CDD expertise that will respond to different \ntopics required from the three DMCs (total of 7 person-months); (ii) seven national consultants \nwith a total of 36 person-months\u2014two national social development consultants from two DMCs \n(total of 10 person-months); two ICT consultants from two DMCs (total of 6 person-months) who \nwill work together with the two national social development consultants; and one research and \nknowledge  management  consultant  based  in  ADB  headquarters  (24  person-months).  The \nnational ICT consultants for each of the selected DMCs will work closely with the national social \ndevelopment consultants and/or international CDD consultant to facilitate discussions with the \ncommunity and local government officials to identify the proposed pilot ICT initiatives. As the TA \nrequires a distinctive combination of specialists on CDD and social development, ICT, and \nresearch  and  knowledge  management  for  the  international  and  national  consultants,  it  is \nunlikely that a consulting firm will be able to provide such diverse specializations. In this regard, \nthe TA must be flexible in its recruitment policy. The outline terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  In-kind government  inputs  are  expected  to  be  in  the form  of  information  provision, \ncollaboration  on  the  design  of  CDD  initiatives,  and  participation  in  national  and  regional \nmeetings.  The  proposed  budget  will  also  support  capacity  building  for  DMCs,  knowledge \ncreation and sharing, and publication and dissemination activities. Disbursements under the TA \nwill be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis, \nfor Supporting the Operationalization of Community-Driven Development in Developing Member \nCountries, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n13 Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  Ministry  of  Public Works,  Indonesia;  and  Department  of  Social Welfare  and \nDevelopment, the Philippines.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased application  At least two new  Country operations   Projects are well designed with \nof CDD approaches  requests for projects  business plan   appropriate interventions \nin selected DMCs  with CDD features    implemented properly by \n  from DMCs reflected in  Reports and  competent and dedicated staff \nthe ADB project  recommendations   \npipeline by 2018  of the President  Risk \n(baseline: 0)  Political economy factors do not \nallow the implementation of an \ninclusive growth agenda \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased knowledge  At least two scoping  CDD scoping  Sustained commitment of DMCs \nand capacity of  studies prepared to  studies  and development partners to \nparticipating DMCs in  operationalize the    participate actively in the TA \nusing CDD  CDD approaches in  Project preparatory    \napproaches   selected DMCs by  information system  Sufficient relevant models are \n  2015 (baseline: 0)    developed, refined, and shared \n    among participating countries and \ninstitutions \n \nRisk \nParticipation of DMCs is hindered \nby political factors and internal \nlimitations \nOutputs   By 2015:    Assumption \n1.
