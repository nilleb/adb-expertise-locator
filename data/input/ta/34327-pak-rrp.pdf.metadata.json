It is now timely for the Government \nto build an enabling business environment for the private sector, \nespecially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which represent \nabout 80% of urban employment and contribute about 30% to \ngross domestic product. With the rapid growth of Pakistan\u2019s urban \ncenters,  the  significance  of  SMEs  in  absorbing  labor  and \ncontributing  to  growth  will  increase.  Despite  many  efforts  to \npromote SMEs in the past, direct government support has proven \nineffective to enhance competitiveness of the SME sector. There \nis a clear need for a well-articulated SME policy determining the \nrole  of  government  in  policy  making  and  facilitating  the \ndevelopment of the SME sector, while the private sector should be \nresponsible  for  delivering  services  to  SMEs.  Existing  service \nproviders  in  the  private  and  public  sectors  have  so  far  been \nunable to provide needed services to SMEs in a significant way \nand  to  upgrade  their  competitiveness.  There  is  a  need  for \ndeveloping service markets since single providers will not be able \nto cater to the diverse needs of SMEs. Similarly, access to formal \nsources of finance is an important constraint of SME growth. \nTraditionally,  SMEs  were  regarded  as  the  clients  of  financial \ninstitutions (FIs) in the public sector. This approach has failed and \nthe  Government  is  now  inclined  to  follow  a  private  sector-led \napproach  to  SME  finance.  However,  the  FI  management\u2019s \ntraditional  reluctance  of  entering  the  SME  market  must  be \novercome through establishment of pioneering examples, which \nwill encourage development of a broader market.  \n \nThe SME Sector Development Program (SDP) aims at filling an \nimportant gap in the strategic agenda of the Government and the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  complementing  ADB\u2019s \ninterventions in Pakistan in rural and microfinance and capital \nmarket  development,  and  providing  market-based  access  to \nservices. The SME SDP builds on lessons learned from other \nemerging  markets  and  considers  existing  and  planned \ninterventions  of  ADB  and  other  funding  agencies  to  minimize \noverlap. The Government recently affirmed the important role of \nSMEs and their potential for economic growth, employment, and \nincome generation in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which \nis also supported by the International Monetary Fund, the World \nBank, and ADB\u2019s country strategy and program. ", "iv   \n \nObjectives  The goal of the SDP is to improve SMEs\u2019 contribution to economic \ngrowth, employment, and poverty reduction. The objective is to \nimprove SMEs' competitiveness. The SDP will support (i) policy \nreforms to improve the business climate with an emphasis on \nleveraging  private  sector  interventions;  (ii)  private  FIs  and \nbusiness development services (BDS) intermediaries in building \nup capabilities to serve SMEs; (iii) market-based outreach of FIs \nthrough  a  partial  credit  guarantee  (PCG)  facility  under  ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations; (iv) the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), \nPakistan\u2019s central bank, in assuming the unambiguous lender of \nlast resort function vis-\u00e0-vis SME Bank; and (v) the Government in \ndisengaging from ownership of SME Bank through privatization. \n \nThe SDP consists of four parts: (i) a program loan supporting \npolicy reforms, (ii) a project loan supporting participatory policy \ndevelopment and building institutions and markets for BDS and \ncredit  for  SMEs,  (iii)  a  PCG  through  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations to leverage market-based credit to SMEs, and (iv) a \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant for coordination of the SDP. \n \nProgram Loan   The SDP supports three major policy outcomes. The first is to \n  improve the SME policy environment through (i) development of \nan SME policy, (ii) establishment of effective labor protection and \nlabor  inspection  policies,  and  (iii)  enhancement  of  the \neffectiveness and outreach to SMEs of the Small and Medium \nEnterprise Development Authority (SMEDA). The second outcome \nis to improve market-based SME access to BDS through the \nestablishment of a Business Support Fund (BSF) managed by the \nprivate sector. The third outcome is to improve the market-based \naccess to and delivery  of SME finance, which entails improving \nthe  regulatory  and  credit  information  infrastructure,  building \nprivate FI capacity for SME finance, and restructuring SME Bank. \n \nCost Estimates  The  costs  of  adjustment  (excluding  the  project  costs)  are \n  estimated  at  $279.5  million  over  the  period  FY2004\u20132007, \nreflecting the reform and development efforts of the Government, \ninvestments  of  SMEs  in  upgrading  their  competitiveness, \ninvestments of FIs in building SME finance capability, and the \nrestructuring and privatization of SME Bank. \n \nFinancing Plan  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  \u00a516,436.52  million  ($152  million \nLoan Amount and Terms  equivalent) from its ordinary capital resources with a 15-year term \nincluding  a  3-year  grace  period,  and  an  interest  rate  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75%  per  annum,  and  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  of  the  loan \namount. ", "  v\n \nTranching  The loan will be released in four tranches subject to compliance \nwith agreed conditions from the date of loan effectiveness up to \nthe loan closing date of 30 June 2007. The first tranche, in the \namount of \u00a53,244.05 million equivalent, will be released upon \neffectiveness of the loan. The release of an incentive tranche in \nthe same amount is expected within 7 months of the release of \nthe first tranche. The second tranche in the same amount and the \nthird tranche comprising the remaining funds are expected in June \n2005 and December 2006, respectively. \n \nImplementation  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency and will also \nArrangements  constitute  the  core  program  management  unit  in  charge  of \nmonitoring and program coordination. The Ministry of Industries \nand Production, SMEDA, Ministry of Labour, BSF, SBP, SME \nBank, and the Ministry of Finance will be implementing agencies. \n \nProcurement  The loan will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of \nitems  produced  in  ADB  member  countries  (except  ineligible \nitems).  \n \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart funds of the program loan will be used for SME Bank \nrestructuring and SMEDA\u2019s outreach program. \n \nProject Loan  The  Project  is  structured  into  three  subprojects.  Subproject  1 \nComponents  supports  policy  formulation,  including  SME  policy  and  labor \nprotection and inspection policy.  Subproject 2 supports market \ndevelopment for SME BDS through the SME BSF. Subproject 3 \nsupports  market  development  for  SME  finance,  including \nregulatory policy development, credit information, and capacity \nbuilding for financial Institutions; and SME Bank restructuring. \n \nCost Estimates  The total project costs are estimated at $28.0 million. ADB will \nprovide a loan of SDR12.501 million ($18.0 million equivalent) \nincluding $7.91 million equivalent in foreign exchange and $10.09 \nmillion equivalent in domestic currency. The remainder of the cost \nwill be borne by the Government, SMEs, and FIs through fees and \ncost-sharing arrangements. \n \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide the loan from its Special Funds resources for a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Project has a 5-year \nduration and the closing date is expected to be 30 June 2009. \n \nExecuting and  These are the same institutions and have the same arrangements \nImplementing Agencies  as for the program loan. \n ", "vi   \n \nProcurement and  Procurement of goods and services is in accordance with ADB's \nConsulting Services  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  All  consultants  who  are  to  be \nfinanced from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements for the engagement of domestic consultants \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nPartial Credit    \nGuarantee Facility   \n \nObjective  The objective of the PCG facility under the SME SDP is twofold: \nfirst,  to  leverage  through  a  market-based  approach  existing \nfinancial resources of the financial system for lending to an SME \nsegment currently underserved by FIs; and second, to provide \ncatalytic support for innovative financial products and approaches \nin new and less familiar markets. Once successfully tested with \nparticipating  financial  institutions  (PFIs),  such  products  will  be \nexpanded among a larger number of FIs. The expected outcome \nof  the  PCG  facility  is  a  higher  volume  of  SME  lending  by \ncommercial FIs in Pakistan. \n \nDesign Features  ADB will share with PFIs the credit risk of SME loans. ADB will \nhave identified these PFIs according to the parameters of the \nPCG  facility.  ADB  will  issue  PCGs  to  PFIs  to  guarantee \nrepayment of an agreed portion of a loan portfolio. The PCGs will \nhave  agreed  cover  amounts  and  time  frames  to  be  selected \nfollowing  a  due  diligence  process.  To  underscore  the  market \napproach, the PCG facility will be provided through ADB\u2019s private \nsector operations without counterguarantee of the Government. \n \nThe PCG facility will have an overall limit of $65 million. Sublimits \nper PFI are set at up to $20 million equivalent. Since the product \nis  new  both  in  Pakistan  and  for  ADB,  the  PCG  facility  will \ncommence operation with commercial FIs that have both well-\nestablished underwriting procedures of an international standard \nand  experience  in  similar  lending  methodologies  elsewhere, \nbefore expanding to domestic FIs. Once ADB is satisfied with the \ntrack record of the PFI and its SME borrowers, portfolio targets \nwill be revised to encourage PFIs to expand further to riskier \nsegments. Guarantee limits with PFIs will be in US dollar terms \nunder each PCG, but PFIs will extend loans to SMEs under the \nPCGs in local currency. The PCG facility will be available for \nissuance of PCGs to PFIs for 5 years from the expected date of \nADB approval, until 31 December 2008. \n \nExecuting Agencies  PFIs identified through a due diligence process. \n ", "  vii \n \nSafeguard Policies  The PCG facility is classified as \u201cFinancial Intermediary.\u201d ADB will \nperform due diligence of the PFIs\u2019 policies and practices and their \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies.  Accordingly,  an  environment \nmanagement  system  will  be  established,  which  will  be \ndocumented in a guarantee administration memorandum. This \nmemorandum will set out the accountability of ADB departments \nin  the  selection  of  PFIs  and  management  under  the  facility \nconsidering  developmental,  commercial,  and  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies and will ensure that the guarantee agreements require \nPFIs to adhere to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines,  as  well  as  to  ADB\u2019s  policies  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  and  private  sector \nGrant  stakeholders in the coordination of the reforms. The total cost of \nthe TA is estimated to be $315,000. ADB will provide $250,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  45  months.  An  individual \nconsultant will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. \n \nSmall and Medium  BDS and financial services directly enhance SME competitiveness \nEnterprise Sector  and productivity, which have a direct and positive impact on SME \nDevelopment Program  profitability and favorably impact job security and employment \nBenefits and Impact  creation. The private sector BDS providers and the FIs will be able \n  to favorably respond to policy reforms. The SDP provides the \nPolicy  framework for developing a consistent SME policy and provides a \ncritical  linkage  of  reforms  with  knowledge  enhancement  and \nfinancial  resource  flow  to  SMEs.  The  SDP  also  supports  the \ncreation of a level playing field in the financial sector through \nprivatization  of  SME  Bank  and  termination  of  SBP\u2019s  special \nrelationship  with  SME  Bank  consistent  with  SBP\u2019s  role  of  a \nregulator and the privatization efforts under the financial sector \nreform program. \n   \nInstitutional  The SDP will support the rationalization and restructuring of two \npublic sector institutions, SMEDA and SME Bank. SMEDA will \nfollow a business plan to expand its outreach and policy support \nto SMEs, and its  management will benefit from business rules \nenhancing its accountability. SME Bank will go through substantial \nrationalization to reduce excessive cost and contingent liabilities \nof its owner, and start building a viable banking business followed \nby its privatization under the SDP. \n \nOutreach to Beneficiaries  SMEs in the informal and formal sectors will be beneficiaries. \nAbout 8,000 SMEs will benefit from the operations of the BSF and \nabout 30,000 SMEs will benefit from access to financial services. \n ", "viii  \n \nRisks  The program design makes a number of assumptions with varying \ndegrees of risk. It is assumed that Pakistan will not suffer from \nmajor  adverse  geopolitical  changes  affecting  its  external  and \ninternal  stability.  It  has  been  assumed  that  the  Government \nremains strongly committed to the reforms undertaken since 1997 \nsupporting  the  poverty  orientation  of  public  expenditure,  the \npromotion  of  SMEs,  and  financial  sector  reforms.  So  far,  the \nGovernment has demonstrated strong ownership and maintains \nhigh priority for the development of SMEs. \n \nThe  reforms  involve  a  number  of  agencies  in  the  public  and \nprivate sectors. The implementation risks have been addressed \nthrough  the  establishment  of  strong  oversight,  implementation \ncoordination, and governance provisions ni  the implementation \nframework.  Reforms  will  be  implemented  through  agencies \nexperienced  with  other  complex  reform  programs,  and  the \nestablishment of a strong core program management unit at the \nMinistry of Finance will ensure that progress and implementation \nrisks are properly managed. \n \nCredibility of the reforms in the private sector and society at large \nis essential. The program design mitigates the risk through the \nestablishment  of  task  forces  representing  stakeholders  and \nthrough  awareness  building  and  consultation  mechanisms  in \ndeveloping policy and disseminating the content. Public sector \ninstitutions  also  bear  a  risk  of  low  public  credibility  and  of \npoliticization.  To  reduce  this  risk,  SMEDA  will  prepare  and \nimplement business plans, which will be shared with the public. \nSME  Bank  will  prepare  and  implement  a  restructuring  plan \nfollowed by a privatization plan, which will be shared with the \npublic  once  it  is  finalized.  Activities  supporting  public  sector \ninstitutions and the private sector under the SDP will be subject \nboth to scrutiny by the SDP steering committee and to regular \nperformance audits, carried out by auditing firms associated with \nrespected international partners. \n \nOverall program risks have been lessened through utilization of \nseveral institutions, predominantly in the private sector. The use of \na number of institutions, for example private sector FIs or private \nBDS providers, puts the program foundations on a broader base \nand thereby reduces the risk if an institution fails to deliver. The \nProgram also adopts an approach of pilot testing before rollout, \nwhich also effectively reduces the risk of failure. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and a proposed private sector partial credit guarantee (PCG) \nfacility for the Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program (SME SDP). The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting Coordination of the \nSME SDP, and if the Board approves the proposed loans and the PCG facility, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the proposed TA.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n1.  Business Climate and Regional Competitiveness \n2.  A good business climate is essential for an enabling environment for investment and \ngrowth and a key factor for competitiveness. A recent assessment1 highlighted Pakistan\u2019s \ncompetitiveness with other Asian countries. Exposed to regional instability through its conflict \nwith India, and wars in neighboring Afghanistan and in the Middle East; and domestically due to \nfrequent changes in government; Pakistan\u2019s private sector investment stagnated at below 10% \nof gross domestic product (GDP), well below India\u2019s 17% in the 1990s. \n \n3.  Businesses are also affected by predatory practices of government officials, especially in \nthe inspection functions and in the contracting of services; by poor enforcement of law; by poor \naccess  to,  and  poor  reliability  and  high  cost  of,  infrastructure  such  as  electricity  and \ntransportation;  and  by  cumbersome  import  and  export  clearance  procedures.  Pakistan\u2019s \ncompetitiveness is undermined by an unfavorable business climate, the combination of high \nlabor costs, high capital intensity per worker, and low productivity. Average wages are about \n50% higher than in Bangladesh, average capital per worker exceeds Bangladesh\u2019s by nearly \n50%, but overall productivity is about the same as in Bangladesh. The 1990s have proven a \ndifficult period, characterized by deteriorating GDP growth and business opportunities and an \nincreasing incidence of poverty. \n \n4.  During the second half of the 1990s, the Government undertook significant structural \nreforms,  which  have  finally  begun  paying  off.2  Since  FY2002,  economic  conditions  have \nimproved, associated with a rebound in industrial production, exports, and private sector credit. \nEconomic growth accelerated from 3.4% in FY2002 to a provisional 5.1% in FY2003. After \nyears of stagnation, exports surged in FY2003 by an impressive 21% to $11.0 billion, while the \ntrade deficit narrowed to about $1.1 billion. Fueled by increased remittances from abroad, the \ncurrent account surplus built up to $4.0 billion in FY2003 and gross foreign exchange reserves \nincreased to about $10.7 billion equivalent to 12 months of import value, by June 2003. The \nexternal inflow of liquidity was largely reflected in the growth of bank deposits (18%) and \nfinancial investments (30%) over the previous 21 months, especially in government securities. \nThese positive trends provided room for an accommodative monetary policy and the State Bank \nof Pakistan (SBP) substantially reduced its discount rate from 14.0% in July 2001 to 7.5% in \nNovember  2002.  The  recent  recovery  demonstrates  the  Government\u2019s  skillful  economic \nmanagement under challenging conditions of global recession and political instability. It sets the \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2003.

", "2  \nfoundation for a second set of reforms aimed at improving the business climate and Pakistan\u2019s \ncompetitiveness and thus strengthening the private sector\u2019s role in sustaining economic growth, \nemployment, and poverty reduction.  \n \n2.  Characteristics and Significance \n5.  Large Informal Economy. Pakistan\u2019s informal economy is a significant contributor to \ngross  national  income  (estimated  at  37%),  employment,  and  livelihoods.  The  share  of \nPakistan\u2019s informal economy is high compared with large Asian countries such as the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, India, and Indonesia, where the informal sector accounts for less than 23% \nof gross national income. This highlights the fact that entrepreneurs face high barriers to entry \nand operation in the formal economy. Although small enterprises may have substantial business \nturnover, current legislation allows enterprises employing 10 staff or below to remain largely \nunregulated and thus avoid taxation, registration, licensing, and supervision requirements. A \nsurvey undertaken in 1988 (footnote 3) indicated that about 97% of enterprises operated in the \ninformal sector. Most enterprises are family owned as sole proprietorships and partnerships.  \n \n6.  Economic Importance understated. Although no official definition exists, the Small and \nMedium Enterprise Development Authority (SMEDA) uses the legal requirement for formalizing \na business (i.e., 10 or more full time staff) as the minimum threshold for defining a small and \nmedium enterprise (SME). Unlike in other developing countries, where thresholds of about 5 \nemployees are common, all informal enterprises, irrespective of business volume, are classified \nas microenterprises, and units employing between 10 and 100 staff are classified as SMEs. \nUsing this definition by SMEDA, about 80,000 SMEs and 2.2 million microenterprises are \nestimated to exist.3 If an internationally more common definition was applied (for example, units \nemploying 5 or more staff), the total number of SMEs could be more than 250,000. The high \nshare of microenterprises reflects distortions and understates the size and potential of the SME \neconomy, which official statistics estimate at 8% of GDP, while SMEDA estimates it at 30 %.4 \n \n7.  Significant Source for Urban Employment.  Since independence, the share of rural \nemployment and the rural sector\u2019s contribution to GDP has seen a falling trend. Currently, the \nrural economy accounts for 47% of employment and contributes 24% to GDP. While Pakistan\u2019s \noverall population grew at an annual 2% in 1991\u20131998, the urban population grew at above 3% \na year, outpacing the growth in rural Pakistan. The nine largest cities, each of which has a \npopulation exceeding 0.5 million, have grown at  faster than 4% a year over the last two \ndecades. With growing urbanization, the significance of the private sector has increased and, \nwith it, the pressure to contain the growing gap between new entrants to the labor market (2.4% \na year) and additional employment generated (1.6% a year). \n \n8.  SMEDA estimates that enterprises employing 100 staff and below contribute 78% to \noverall urban employment, of which those employing 10 staff and below contribute about 60%. \nSME employment in services and in trade is most significant with 40% and 36%, respectively, \nfollowed by manufacturing with 24%, while employment in the smallest units is highest in trade, \nfollowed by far less significant employment in the manufacturing and services subsectors. \n                                                 \n3  Since no official data for the informal sector exist and enterprise surveys are outdated, SMEDA extrapolated the \nresults of a survey of establishments carried out in 1988. Currently, the Federal Bureau of Statistics is preparing a \ncomprehensive survey, the \u201cEconomic Census,\u201d which will serve as a basis for better information on SMEs. \n4  In its new prudential regulations for SME finance issued on 28 October 2003, SBP has defined the upper threshold \nfor SMEs as enterprises employing up to 250 employees and an annual business turnover of up to PRs300 million \n($5 million), while having no definition of a lower threshold. The upper threshold for employment and the use of \nbusiness turnover are in line with international practice. ", "  3\nOfficial statistics report SME employment at only 5.8 million. However, the Labor Force Survey \n(1997\u20131998) estimated that 53% of the work force or 19 million people are employed in trade, \nservices, and manufacturing, suggesting that official statistics substantially understate the size \nof the urban labor force and its absorption by SMEs.  \n \n9.  Distribution  by  Sector  and  Region.  Most  SMEs  are  concentrated  in  trade  and \nservices,  accounting  for  about  51%  and  34%  of  them,  respectively,  while  manufacturing \nrepresents only 15% of SMEs. The main manufacturing activities of SMEs in the urban formal \nand informal economies are textile production, food processing, metal production including \nautomotive  spare  parts  and  electrical  items,  surgical  goods,  sporting  goods,  and  leather \nproduction. Most SMEs are concentrated in the urban agglomerations. The industrial centers of \nFaisalabad, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sheikhupura, and Sialkot, which were originally centers for \nagricultural production and trade, are now home to manufacturing enterprises both for the \ndomestic and international markets. Some SMEs that originally started in small industry clusters \nhave become exporters. However, a recent survey of about 1,000 entrepreneurs (footnote 1) \nindicates that only 15% of sales are related to exports and 8% of supplies are purchased from \nabroad. Only scant information on SMEs in the trade and service subsectors is available and \nlittle attention has so far been paid to them because of their small size, presence in the informal \neconomy, and domestic market orientation. However, given their large number and contribution \nto employment, their economic potential is significant. \n \n10.  The term SME covers highly heterogeneous groups of enterprises. Despite difficulty in \nobtaining reliable information, these can be broadly characterized as follows: \n \n(i)  Very small enterprises or microenterprises typically employ up to four staff, \nmostly from the same family. Activities include handicraft, textile, shops, trade, \nand  services,  often  at  the  home  premises  of  the  owners.  Professional, \nmanagerial, marketing, and technical skills are usually limited to producing single \nproducts  or  products  and  services  for  the  daily  needs  of  households.  The \nbusiness is mainly oriented toward generating the necessary income for survival \nof the family and very few have a growth orientation. There is anecdotal evidence \nof a high closure rate of such entities within the first 2 years of starting operation. \nThese enterprises usually work through a network of families and are almost \nexclusively in the informal sector.  \n \n(ii)  Small informal enterprises typically employ from five to nine staff and are \nlargely family-based, having grown from the micro stage. Business sectors are \nsimilar to those of microenterprises. Professional, managerial, and technical skills \nare  higher  than  in  the  microenterprises,  obtained  mainly  through  on-the-job \nexperience of the owners. These units are more growth oriented, and use a \nsignificant  part  of  their  business  revenues  to  invest  in  expansion.  Business \ngrowth relies heavily on family relationships. Typically, these enterprises lack \naccess to formal credit and support services. They have good growth potential if \nthey are supported by the financial sector and other business services. \n \n(iii)  Small formal sector enterprises5 typically employ between 10 and 100 staff. \nBased on family management, these enterprises usually have well-established \n                                                 \n5  International classifications often define SME units from 5 to 50 staff as small- and from 50 to 250 as medium-\nsized. Since there are no reliable statistics at the moment on the number of enterprises according to this definition, \nsmall formal sector enterprises are defined in this report as those employing between 10 and 100 staff.  ", "4  \nrelationships  with  larger  manufacturing  and  trade  concerns  and  are  growth \noriented. Because of their family roots, a number of enterprises in this group face \nchallenges of leadership and management as the business grows and with it the \ncomplexity of management. Most enterprises in this category draw their financial \nresources  from  retained  earnings,  and  long-standing  supplier  and  buyer \nrelationships.  Since  business  information  and  documentation  is  not  readily \navailable, many enterprises in this group face difficulty in accessing finance from \nfinancial institutions (FIs). This segment, which SMEDA estimates at 80,000 \nunits, has, however, significant growth potential if external support for business \nservices and finance is available.  \n \n(iv)  Medium-sized enterprises typically employ between 100 and 250 staff, and \nhave well-established supplier and buyer relationships with small formal and \ninformally operating enterprises, as well as with large domestic and international \ncorporate entities. Usually, these enterprises are in the manufacturing business \nboth in the domestic and export markets. Although this segment normally has \nprofessionally  sophisticated  management,  there  is  a  need  to  maintain \ncompetitiveness in these markets. This enterprise type is an important source of \nemployment and of linkage between the formal and informal economies. Access \nto finance is normally constrained through the FIs\u2019 still existing focus on large and \ngovernment customers.  \n \n3.  Policies and Public Sector Support \n11.  The  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  SMEs  for  employment  and  income \ngeneration and has made the development of SMEs one of four key areas of intervention under \nits 10-year development plan for 2001\u20132011 and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The \nGovernment established SMEDA in 1998 to spearhead the development of SMEs through (i) \npolicy advice, (ii) provision and facilitation of services, and (iii) becoming itself a lobbying force \nof SMEs with the Government. Initially, SMEDA focused on the preparation of sector studies \nand dissemination of information for SMEs. Since FY2000, SMEDA has provided direct services \nto  SMEs,  such  as  training  courses  reaching  about  5,000  participants  and  preparation  of \nbusiness  plans  for  about  40  SMEs.  SMEDA  has  also  contributed  to  research  and  has \ncommissioned surveys to study the business climate. Despite its achievements, SMEDA\u2019s \noutreach to SMEs needs to be strengthened to go beyond direct involvement in providing \nservices at below market prices. Under the program preparatory technical assistance (PPTA),6 \nSMEDA\u2019s performance was analyzed and a draft business plan was prepared to help SMEDA \nfocus on policy development and on facilitation of the development of regional and industry \nbusiness clusters. \n \n12.  In addition to SMEDA, the federal Government supports exporting enterprises through \nthe Export Promotion Bureau. As a special department under the Ministry of Commerce, the \nExport Promotion Bureau provides support for marketing, research, fairs and exhibitions, and \ntrade delegations, and provides linkages with business membership organizations. The Export \nPromotion Bureau has no specific SME focus.7 Provincial governments have established their \nown business support institutions to develop industrial estates, provide low-cost credit to SMEs, \nand  offer  vocational  training.  However,  the  federal  and  provincial  governments\u2019  initiatives, \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002.  Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Preparing the Small and Medium \nEnterprise Sector Development Program. Manila. \n7  Under the Small and Medium Enterprise Trade Enhancement Finance Project (Loan 1796-PAK), ADB supports the \nMinistry of Commerce in developing a holistic approach to trade facilitation, which includes the needs of SMEs.  ", "  5\nmainly in response to perceived market failure, have had limited success in providing services \nto SMEs because of the supply-led approach and the high discretion of officials in the allocation \nof support, which have undermined the credibility of such schemes among the public. \n \n4.  Representation and Access to Business Services \n13.  Business Membership Organizations. SMEs are represented in 29 active chambers of \ncommerce and industry, in 84 national associations for industry and trade, and in provincial and \ncluster business associations. Dominated by the larger members, most chambers represent the \ninterests of the large businesses in their interaction with the Government. The more progressive \nchambers of Karachi, Lahore, and Sialkot provide training and advisory services for quality \nmanagement  and  trade  promotion.  SMEs  have  a  higher  participation  in  the  business \nassociations, which are strongest in manufacturing, followed by services. The trade subsector, a \nmainstay for SMEs, is poorly represented by the business organizations. A few associations, \nincluding the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants, \nhave established dedicated training programs; most associations, however, while interested in \ntangible outputs of technical process upgrading, marketing, and skills upgrading, lack the \nresources to conduct such programs. \n \n14.  Private  Business  Service  Providers.  There  are  a  number  of  business  schools, \ninternational training centers, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), which provide training \nin entrepreneurship. However, the target audience for many of these courses is the well-\neducated, often English-speaking middle class; these courses are not accessible to the vast \nmajority of Urdu-speaking entrepreneurs. Business advisory services are available, but are \nusually targeted more to wealthy individuals or large corporate entities. A survey conducted \nunder the PPTA highlighted the low awareness of the availability and low usage of business \ndevelopment services (BDS) among SMEs. SMEs expressed the need for external support in (i) \nmarketing,  market  research,  and  market  information;  (ii)  technical  quality  management, \nespecially for exporters; (iii) technical processing; and (iv) strategic planning. The survey echoes \ninternational experience that the needs for external support are varied and depend on the \nbusiness sector and on the age of the enterprise. The variety of needs is so wide that it is \nimpossible for a public service provider to accommodate such demand.  \n \n5.  Mobilization of Financial Resources \n15.  Private FI Domination of Support for SMEs. Pakistan\u2019s banking system consists of 40 \nbanks, most of which are privately owned. Thirty of these banks report lending to SMEs (SME \ndefinition varies by bank), equivalent to about 15% of the banking system\u2019s total loans. Despite \nits mandate to serve SMEs, SME Bank, a development finance institution (DFI), contributes only \n0.5% of all loans to SMEs. About 91% of the current banking system\u2019s lending to SMEs is \ngenerated by private banks (including Habib Bank Limited, which is being privatized), leaving a \nmarginal 9% of the market to state-owned banks. This is consistent with the Government\u2019s \npolicy of privatizing the banking system.  \n \n16.  Uneven Growth of Commercial Lending to SMEs. Consistent with SBP\u2019s reduction in \nthe discount rate, the average spread of the banks8 decreased from 8.5% to 5.7% during the \nJuly 2001 to June 2003 period, while average lending rates were lowered from 14.5% to 7.6%. \nFollowing a 2% increase during FY2002, credit to the private sector declined slightly by 0.8% \nduring the first 9 months of FY2003 to PRs1,056 billion ($18.3 billion). The largest total lending \n                                                 \n8  Defined as the differential between average lending and deposit rates of the banking system.  ", "6  \nexposure of banks is to the textile industry (25%) followed by agribusiness (10%), while loans to \ntrade and commercial enterprises, which represent about 50% of all business establishments, \nrepresented an extremely low share of total lending exposure (3%). During the first half of \nFY2003, lending to large corporate clients increased by 7% and to consumer finance by 17.3% \n(although from low levels), while lending to SMEs declined by 4.5%.  \n \n17.  This uneven performance in a period of easing monetary policy and high liquidity in the \nmarket is partly explained by the risk-averse attitude of banks, and the rigidity in prudential \nregulations of SBP, especially with regard to lending limits and the restriction on FIs to lend \nagainst collateral. SBP and the private sector\u2019s credit information bureaus maintain incomplete \ncoverage of loan exposures for loans below PRs500,000, which makes it difficult for FIs to \nobtain  the  necessary  credit  information  for  smaller  borrowers.  Also,  the  existing  secured \ntransactions law and the commercial court system are ineffective, thereby contributing to a \nmarket that is not conducive to lending to SMEs. By improving credit information and enabling \nprovision of loans collateralized by movable assets, financing to the SME sector, especially the \ninformal/nonregistered SMEs, could be facilitated and SME access to finance broadened.  \n \n18.  SME Finance Activities. SMEs, especially those in the informal sector, are largely \nfinanced through the private savings of the owner, retained earnings of the enterprise, and/or \nfamily and friends. Access to finance from other informal sources is insignificant. According to a \nrecent  survey  of  approximately  1,000  SME  manufacturers  (footnote  1),  only  1%  of  those \nsurveyed borrowed money from formal sources for working capital purposes. Other sources of \nfinancing, such as trade credit, amounted to less than 5% of those surveyed. Utilization of credit \nfrom FIs by manufacturers employing fewer than 100 employees is only 7%. In general, the \nlending policies of banks tend to favor the manufacturing sector, and although the majority of \nSMEs are in trade and services, overall formal credit to trade and services is insignificant.  \n \n19.  Credit Access Limited at All SME Levels. Despite the large number (1.7 million) of \nvery small enterprises employing fewer than five employees, total lending by the formal sector \nto this segment is negligible. Even for the 250,000 SMEs with five or more employees, it is \nestimated that less than 5% have access to formal credit.9 Recent surveys10 indicate somewhat \nbetter access to credit for the medium SME manufacturers, although still only about 13% of \nmanufacturing SMEs with more than 100 employees reported access to formal financing for \nworking capital, and 24% reported access to investment capital. Access improves gradually with \nfirm size, although the majority of SMEs with business turnover below PRs300 million and 250 \nemployees appear underserved. Loan accounts up to PRs100 million account for less than 10% \nof total banking loan exposure. Many surveys confirm that from an entrepreneur\u2019s perspective, \nlack of access to and cost of bank financing are significant impediments to growth. All this \nsignals that there is significant market potential and likely demand for FIs to lend to SMEs at all \nlevels, including for the trade and service sectors and for financing working capital. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n1.  Business Climate and Small and Medium Enterprise Policy \n20.  Although SMEs constitute the mainstay of the urban economy, industrial and trade \npolicies and laws have favored larger businesses; smaller units are particularly affected by the \npoor business climate. Many laws, regulations, and practices developed prior to Pakistan\u2019s \n                                                 \n9  Information from banks confirms that lending up to PRs5 million is insignificant, with only about 10,000 borrowers. \n10 Footnote 1 and the World Bank, Pakistan\u2019s Small Entrepreneur, Gallup World Bank Survey (2001).Unpublished. ", "  7\nindependence  and  during  a  period  of  interventionist  approaches  to  development  are  now \nredundant. Written in the English language, laws and most policies are not accessible to the \nvast majority of the population. Unprotected and ignorant of their rights and duties, many SMEs \nare  exposed  to  \u201cpredatory\u201d  practices  of  inspectors,  who  are  claiming  fees  for  alleged \nnoncompliance with laws and regulations. \n \n21.  Despite  the  strategic  importance  of  SMEs  for  economic  activity  in  general,  and \nemployment in particular, the Government has so far not articulated consistent policies for the \nSME sector and has resorted to a practice of ad hoc interventions. A policy is needed to \nestablish (i) the role and accountability of the Government and its agencies and the private \nsector in developing SMEs and (ii) effective interface mechanisms between these organizations. \nIssues  to  be  addressed  in  an  SME  policy  are  diverse,  and  policy  development  and \nimplementation will need to go through a participatory process. The process requires careful \npreparation and implementation under which the following principal issues will be addressed. \n \n22.  Improvement  in  the  Business  Environment.  An  important  step  is  the  review  of \nlegislation and regulation, which is currently being made through the Deregulation Commission \naiming to simplify laws and administrative procedures.11 Another important step is making laws \nand rules transparent and understood through dissemination in the local language and through \naccess to free basic legal advice.12 \n \n23.  Definition of the Role of Private and Public Sector Stakeholders. This entails (i) the \nidentification of market failure and failure of government institutions to assess the possible need \nand  potential  for  successful  direct  government  intervention;  (ii)  based  on  the  limitations \nidentified under (i), the assignment of accountability to the Government and the private sector in \nshaping  policy,  and  facilitating  development  of  SMEs;  (iii)  responsibilities  at  the  federal, \nprovincial, and local levels; (iv) topic-specific lead functions among government departments \nand agencies; (v) the role of the Government in facilitating BDS; (vi) the role of the private \nsector in facilitating and providing BDS; and (vii) preparation of a strategic framework for \ninstitutional reform of government agencies involved in the support of SMEs. \n \n24.  Clear Definition of SMEs.  This is essential to determine the boundary for targeting \npolicy  interventions.  Because  of  the  large  variety  of  institutions,  the  issue  of  formal  and \ninformally operating units must be addressed.  \n \n25.  Development of Strategy and Institutional Framework. The strategy would articulate \nthe  government  and  private  sector  contribution  toward  policy  development,  including  an \ninstitutional framework for implementing the policy.  \n \n26.  Development  of  an  SME  Database  and  Performance  Monitoring  Mechanism. \nReliable information on SMEs is unavailable, as the last comprehensive survey of enterprises \nwas undertaken 15 years ago. The Economic Census currently being prepared by the Ministry \n                                                 \n11 The Deregulation Commission is chaired by the Minister of Industries and Production and has undertaken the \nreview of the Factories Act (1934), which constitutes the umbrella legislation for many enterprise-related laws. The \nMinistry of Labour has undertaken to simplify labor laws and is consolidating 42 laws into six laws. The World Bank \nis assisting the work of the Deregulation Commission. \n12 There are other issues essential for improving the business environment such as the access to public utilities, \ntransport, communication, financial services, and facilitation of customs, which will not be necessarily addressed \nunder an SME policy. These issues are being addressed by the Government and international financial institutions \nthrough sector-specific programs. ADB is addressing these through its operations in the power and transport \nsectors. ", "8  \nof Economic Affairs and Statistics provides an opportunity for an update analysis of SMEs. \nFurther, an annual update of statistical information could promote a sound basis for assessment \nof developments of the SME sector and for policy decisions. \n \n2.  Labor Protection and Inspection \n27.  Feedback from the private sector, government stakeholders, and studies points to the \nabuse of power of tax and labor inspectors, which absorbs significant entrepreneurial time. \nConversely, the benefits of maintaining basic labor standards for a good work environment and \nthe consequent positive impact on profitable enterprises are not understood. Current labor laws \nare to a large extent outdated, and reform efforts to simplify laws and inspection procedures are \ncarried out in a policy vacuum. It is therefore necessary to formulate labor protection policies as \nan adequate framework for the development of a labor inspection function to be characterized \nby least intervention, awareness building of employers and employees, development of self-\ninspection, and subcontracting arrangements with the private sector. Such policies need to be \ndeveloped in a consultative process with stakeholders, and shared with the public. \n \n3.  Public Sector Support \n28.  Since  its  establishment  in  1998,  SMEDA  has  undergone  major  changes  in  its \norganization to become more responsive to the needs of SMEs. Although SMEDA has gained \npermanent status as an authority by virtue of an ordinance, the ordinance provides excessive \npowers  and  discretion  to  the  board,  unless  executive  powers  are  delegated  to  the  chief \nexecutive officer through business rules and performance benchmarks. In addition, SMEDA\u2019s \npolicy advisory role needs to be firmed up in providing active support in the development of the \nSME policy. Direct interventions in SME training and in the preparation of business plans have \nproduced quality outputs but have been constrained by limited outreach. While SMEDA has \nmade a commendable contribution to making laws and regulations, and sector studies and \nreviews  available  to  an  English-speaking  audience,  these  outputs  will  need  to  be  made \navailable in the local language to ensure a broader outreach.13 SMEDA has established some \nconnections with regional and industry SME clusters, for example to upgrade processing and \nproduct quality in the textile sector. It is now timely that SMEDA moves to medium-term \nplanning and monitoring of its activities with a focus on outreach to SMEs through facilitation. \n \n4.  Market Access to Knowledge-Based Services  \n29.  Pakistan provides public sector support to manufacturing and exporting enterprises. \nHowever, hands-on business support to SMEs is rare. Located in the public sector, institutions \nare constrained by the lack of strategic direction, exposure to government directives, and lack of \nbusiness expertise. A number of private sector service providers focus on legal matters, tax and \naudit, and management consulting. There are an estimated  30,000 legal advisers and 476 \nchartered accountants, among whom 11% provide management consulting services. Also, there \nare a number of private sector providers in the education sector in response to the often limited \nservice outreach and quality provided by the public sector. Clearly, service providers are highly \nfragmented and have not yet identified SMEs as their clientele. As these services in the public \nsector are not demand driven and lack professionalism, there is a large unmet demand for \nmarket-based services for SMEs.  \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for Access to Justice Program. Manila. (under Loans 1897-PAK and 1898-PAK, \napproved on 20 December 2001 for $330 million, the Government committed to issue a simplified Urdu version of \nany new law). ", "  9\n30.  The PPTA identified needs in the areas of practical and strategic business advice, \nfinancing,  marketing,  and  technology  upgrading.  Since  SMEs  cover  a  high  diversity  of \nbusinesses characterized by stage of development, sector, target market, and educational \nbackground, the needs are highly diversified. International experience suggests that public \nservice providers are ineffective in reducing the knowledge gap though, and are unable to \nrespond to the variety of needs of  the market. On the other hand, information asymmetry \nbetween potential users and providers of services is an important reason for the lack of \ndeveloped service markets. Since the early 1990s, various government-supported facilities have \nbeen established to  support  the  development  of  market-based services for entrepreneurs. \nUnder such schemes, a business support facility provides support to SMEs on a first-come-first-\nserved basis, after satisfactory evidence of the business support case. Such facilities are best \nplaced  and  managed  in  the  private  sector,  with  the  Government  playing  an  important \nsupervisory role. Stakeholder feedback from the private sector obtained during the preparation \nof the SDP clearly identified the need to kick-start development of a BDS industry for SMEs. \n \n5.  Market Access to Finance \n31.  Ineffective Government Promotion of SMEs. Mismanagement of government-owned \nbanks and DFIs brought Pakistan to the verge of a banking crisis in 1996. Recognizing the \nfailure of interventionist policies, the Government has conducted, since 1997, an aggressive \nreform by strengthening the autonomy and capacity of SBP, privatizing banks, consolidating the \nsector through increased capital requirements, and gradually phasing out DFIs through merger \nwith or transformation into commercial banks. While the reforms improved the performance of \nthe FIs, the risk-adverse mind-set of the new managers has led to a standstill of lending to \nsmaller SMEs. In light of recent high liquidity in the market, FIs increasingly see the need to \ndevelop new markets for SMEs. Among the reasons for the low FI outreach to SMEs are: \n \n(i)  most SMEs are in the informal economy and not considered creditworthy; \n(ii)  based on physical collateral, lending processes and products are not adapted to \nthe characteristics of SMEs; \n(iii)  SMEs lack physical collateral to pledge as security for loans; and \n(iv)  FIs lack the requisite lending and risk management processes to determine the \ncash-flow generation capacity without documentation. \n \n32.  Credit Information Systems. SBP and FIs also recognize the importance of good credit \ninformation systems for improving the outreach of SME finance. Currently, one public and three \nprivate service providers are established in Pakistan. The coverage of the services, however, is \nhighly fragmented and the public credit information bureaus need to improve data integrity and \ncoverage. International experience shows that well-established credit information and registry \nsystems exist both in the public and private sectors, and that the role of the private sector \ndepends on its willingness to provide full coverage of credit information at reasonable cost even \non the smallest borrowings. There is a need for a strategy of developing credit information and \nregistry systems and linking the public and private systems, enhancing their outreach.  \n \n33.  Prudential Regulations. Until very recently, prudential regulations required banks to \napply the same criteria for lending to small and large clients. \u201cClean lending\u201d  on a cash-flow \nbasis was limited to $1,700 equivalent. There is significant overlap between SME and consumer \nfinance since the goods and services financed can be of use for businesses as well as private \nconsumers. For small enterprises, the border between  the private and business spheres is \nusually blurred. SBP therefore recognized the need to revise regulations for encouraging the \nbanks to develop innovative but prudent ways for SME and consumer finance. ", "10  \n34.  Stimulating the Market for SME Finance. Given the large diversity of financial needs \nand degrees of sophistication of SMEs, one approach alone will not suffice to stimulate the \nmarket. Innovative approaches supporting higher risk taking through proven lending processes \nbased on the cash flow of the borrower are warranted to replace the classic collateral-based \nlending. Commercial FIs need to develop dedicated SME finance capacity through a client-\nfocused approach and lending process that differ substantially from existing processes for \ncorporate and retail lending. Internationally, a downscaling approach has been successfully \ntested to incentivize banks to move down market. This also leads the way for Pakistan\u2019s FIs. \n \n35.  Traditional Efforts and Lessons Learned for SME Lending.  Traditional efforts to \nimprove credit flow to SMEs often include targeted credit. Experience in Pakistan and elsewhere \nhas shown mixed results, with (i) low utilization of credit lines when channeled through private \nFIs, characterized by a lack of adequate incentives and responsiveness to market change; and \n(ii) high default of credit when channeled through public sector FIs, resulting from inherent moral \nhazard and poor governance. A key lesson learned is that incentives matter. Collateral-based \nlending is costly for small loans, and there are alternatives with more attractive risk-reward \nstructures. Hence, access to capital is not merely an issue of availability of funds, but of risk \nmanagement and establishment of appropriate incentives for FIs to lend to SMEs.  \n \n36.  Mobilizing Existing Liquidity in the Market for SME Lending. A number of capacity-\nbuilding as well as policy measures have recently been initiated, to be supported under the \nproposed SME SDP. This includes the development of commercial banks\u2019 capability to extend \ncredit to and manage risks of SMEs, through the buildup of dedicated SME business units. \nHowever, FIs continue placing large amounts of liquidity in low-risk government bonds and \ncorporate loans, reflecting an important barrier of their highly risk-averse approach that needs to \nbe overcome through suitable lending processes, and products. \n \n37.  The ADB\u2019s PCG instrument\u2014which in a partnership with selected FIs shares some of \nthe risks, and rewards, associated with SME lending\u2014is a suitable vehicle to raise the comfort \nlevel of participating FIs (PFIs) for SME lending, by (i) mitigating the impact on the FIs\u2019 capital \nbase in case of systemic risk occurrence, (ii) supporting increased flow of funds to SMEs \nthrough effective leveraging of the PFIs\u2019 equity, (iii) assisting PFIs to gradually develop client \nrelationships with smaller SME clients, and (iv) introducing to Pakistan international good \npractice in SME lending processes and products.  \n \n38.  Disengaging  from  Government  Ownership  in  SME  Bank.  The  Government \nestablished SME Bank in January 2002 through the merger of two failed DFIs.14 SME Bank \ninherited all assets, liabilities, staff, privileges, and duties of the precursor DFIs, including a \nnonperforming  loan  portfolio  exceeding  85%  of  outstanding  principal.  SME  bank\u2019s  biggest \nliability, however, is the more than 1,000 unqualified staff with permanent employment status, \nrepresenting about 90% of total staff strength. Previously, management assigned 900 of these \nto recover the old loan portfolio, which after initial success is now witnessing substantial decline. \nAs more difficult cases are to be resolved, average monthly recovery has dropped to below 60% \nof its peak in FY2001. SME Bank now needs to rigorously reduce unqualified but highly paid \nstaff, who put increasing pressure on profitability and add to the Government\u2019s contingent \nliabilities. \n \n39.  The SME Bank\u2019s new business since January 2002 has generated a high level of \nnonperforming loans. Over the past 6 months, the proportion of past dues above 90 days has \n                                                 \n14 The Small Business Finance Corporation and the Regional Development Finance Corporation. ", "  11\nincreased from 6% to 13% of the outstanding loans, emphasizing the need for a different, \ncommercially oriented approach. Appointment of a head for SME credit is essential since only a \nfew of SME Bank\u2019s staff in the lending operations have the requisite commercial skills to \ndevelop the business. SME Bank still enjoys significant privileges with SBP, through a profit and \nloss sharing arrangement and subsidized loans from SBP, which constitute about 83% of the \nbank\u2019s overall resources. This has allowed SME Bank to make profits through investments in \nhigh-interest government bonds. As part of the reform and restructuring of SME Bank, the \nGovernment and SBP agreed to terminate the special privileges of SME Bank and to eliminate \nSBP\u2019s shareholding in the bank. The SME Bank is envisaged to be privatized within 3 years. \n \n6.  Lessons Learned \n40.  Operational lessons learned from Pakistan and numerous emerging markets relevant for \nthe design of the SME SDP include the following: \n \n(i)  Governments play a key role as facilitators for market development, while direct \nservice provision should be left to the private sector;  \n(ii)  Regulatory support, and stimulation of market-based BDS, has proven effective \nin promoting economic growth and employment; \n(iii)  Policy development must take place in a consultative and participatory process \ninvolving a wide range of stakeholders to gain credibility;  \n(iv)  Government provision of services to SMEs bears high risks of missing targeted \nneeds  and  should  be  strictly  limited  to  interventions,  where  market  failure \nprevents delivery through the private sector;  \n(v)  Because of the diversity of the needs, a large number of services is needed; \n(vi)  BDS should be demand driven; \n(vii)  Subsidies should be terminated when markets and products are established; and \n(viii)  Rigorous  controls  and  business  ethics  must  be  established  to  ensure  good \ngovernance and public credibility of the schemes. \n \n7.  Rationale  \n41.  The SME SDP aims at filling an important gap in the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s strategic \nagenda, and complements ADB\u2019s interventions in rural finance and microfinance and in capital \nmarket development, supporting provision of market-based access for the beneficiaries. The \nSME SDP builds on lessons learned from other emerging markets and considers existing and \nplanned interventions of ADB and other funding agencies to minimize overlap. SME access to \nphysical  infrastructure  and  trade  facilitation  are  important  areas  supported  under  ADB\u2019s \noperations in the power and transport sectors and the Small and Medium Enterprise Trade \nEnhancement Finance Project. Neither fiscal reform, including the inspection function for tax \ninspectors, nor the work of the Deregulation Commission, were included in the scope of the \nProgram, since the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank support these areas. The \nGovernment recently affirmed the important role of SMEs and their potential for economic \ngrowth, employment, and income generation in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which is \nalso supported by ADB\u2019s country strategy and program, the International Monetary Fund, and \nthe World Bank.  \n \n \n \n ", "12  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n42.  The long-term goal of the SDP is to improve the SME sector contribution to economic \ngrowth, employment, and poverty reduction. The objective of the SDP is to improve SMEs' \ncompetitiveness. The SDP will support (i) the Government in policy reforms to improve the \nbusiness climate with an emphasis on leveraging private sector interventions, (ii) private FIs and \nBDS intermediaries in building up the requisite capabilities to serve SMEs, (iii) market-based \noutreach  of  financial  intermediaries  through  a  PCG  facility  under  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations, (iv) SBP to assume an unambiguous lender of last resort functions vis-\u00e0-vis SME \nBank,  and  (v)  the  Government  in  disengaging  from  ownership  in  SME  Bank  through \nprivatization after restructuring its insolvent operations. \n \n43.  The SDP consists of four parts: (i) a program loan supporting policy reforms; (ii) a project \nloan,  the  SME  Sector  Development  Project  comprising  three  subprojects  supporting \nparticipatory  policy  development,  and  building  institutions  and  markets  for  BDS  and  SME \nfinance; (iii) a PCG through ADB\u2019s private sector operations to enhance credit to SMEs; and (iv) \na TA grant to support implementation of the SDP. The program framework summarizes the \ndesign (Appendix 1). The development policy letter and the policy matrix summarize the agreed \npolicy reforms (Appendix 2). \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n44.  Government Focus on Policy Setting and Facilitation. The SDP supports the focus \nof the Government and its agencies on policy setting, catalytic support, and coordinating efforts \nof the private sector in the SME sector, while refraining from direct intervention in areas where \nservices are and can be provided by the private sector. \n \n45.  Building  Credibility  Through  Good  Governance.  The  SDP  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to strengthen governance through enhanced transparency of regulations \nand their implementation in order to reduce interference and possibilities for rent seeking by \nofficials. The SDP also supports the establishment of the SME Business Support Fund (BSF) \nmanaged by the private sector under strict business ethics, rules for conflict of interest, and \nexternal audit. \n \n46.  Blending ADB Instruments and Adopting Lessons Learned. The Program integrates \nADB\u2019s public and private sector operations and mobilizes domestic resources of the FIs to \nfinance SMEs through the PCG facility, thereby promoting a market-based approach and \navoiding risks of failures associated with traditional credit-line support. \n \n47.  Privatization of SME Bank. The SDP supports (i) containing the fiscal risks associated \nwith an insolvent institution; (ii) termination of special lender of first resort and shareholding \nrelationship with SBP; and (iii) transfer of the operations to the private sector. \n \nC.  The Program Loan \n \n1.  Components and Outputs \n48.  The Program entails three policy outcomes in six key result areas (KRAs):  \n ", "  13\nOutcome 1   Improve SME Policy Environment  \nKRA 1.1   Develop SME Policy \nKRA 1.2   Establish Effective Labor Protection and Labor Inspection Policies \nKRA 1.3  Enhance SMEDA\u2019s Effectiveness and Outreach to SMEs \n \nOutcome 2  Improve  Market-Based  SME  Access  to  Business  Development \nServices \nKRA 2  Enhance SME Competitiveness Through Private Sector Services \n \nOutcome 3   Improve Market-Based Access to and Delivery of SME Finance \nKRA 3.1  Improve  Regulatory  and  Credit  Information  Infrastructure  and  Build \nPrivate FI Capacity \nKRA 3.2  Restructure and Privatize SME Bank  \n \na.  Improve SME Policy Environment \n \n49.  Develop SME Policy. Under the SDP, the Government will establish a task force to \ndevelop in a participatory and consultative process an SME policy framework paper and to \nprovide the background analysis and basis for its development. The policy will cover (i) a \nstrategy and action plan, (ii) enterprise size definition,  (iii) the focus of government support \nthrough policy reforms and targeted inventions using services from the private sector, (iv) the \nrole of the private sector in providing services and shaping SME policy, and (v) other priority \nissues identified by the task force. The task force will delegate specific topics to focused policy \nadvisory groups facilitated by a government representative and private sector representatives \nand will consult with provincial government and consider ongoing reforms at the provincial level \nas appropriate. The results of the advisory groups will be consolidated and prioritized into an \noverall draft policy and action plan in a consultative process. The SME policy will be issued by \nthe Government and supplemented by an action and resource plan for implementation during \nthe  second  half  of  the  program  period.  This  includes  the  publication  of  the  first  SME \ndevelopment report in Urdu. \n \n50.  Establish Effective Labor Protection and Labor Inspection Policies. To improve the \nunderstanding of the purpose of labor protection and its positive impact on enterprise efficiency, \nand to provide a reasonable benchmark for the approaches and objectives of labor inspection, a \nnational  labor  protection  policy  based  on  core  labor  standards  will  be  developed  in  a \nconsultative process with all stakeholders. To curb the abuse of power of labor inspectors, a \nnew labor inspection policy based on the labor protection policy and characterized by least \nintervention  of  the  Government,  awareness  building  of  employers  and  employees,  and \ndevelopment self-inspection and subcontracting arrangements with the private sector, will be \ndeveloped  once  the  labor  protection  policy  is  in  place.  These  national  policies  will  be \ncommunicated through awareness-building seminars and publications for implementation at the \nprovincial level.15 Subsequent to the issuance of the labor inspection policy, the Government will \nrevise the Factories Act (1934) as necessary to reflect the reforms of the labor protection and \ninspection policies. \n \n51.  Enhance  SMEDA\u2019s  Effectiveness  and  Outreach  to  SMEs.  The  Government  will \nimprove the governance and business focus of SMEDA through the appointment of a full-time \nprofessional chief executive officer and implementation of a 5-year SMEDA business plan, to be \n                                                 \n15 Development of the SME policy and the labor protection and inspection policies will be supported by consultants to \nbe hired under Subproject 1 as detailed in Appendix 4. ", "14  \napproved by 30 June 2004, according to clearly defined performance benchmarks. To improve \nits outreach to SME clusters, SMEDA will also determine the design of and implement a 5-year \nbusiness plan for developing shared facilities for SME clusters under common facility centers \n(CFCs)  against  clearly  defined  performance  criteria.  To  enhance  its  policy  advisory  role, \nSMEDA will establish a secretariat for the SME policy task force at SMEDA. To clarify the role of \nthe SMEDA management, the SMEDA board will issue business rules to ensure accountability \nof the management team for day-to-day operations. The performance of SMEDA and its CFC \nprogram will be supervised by its board and will be subject to independent performance audits. \n \nb.  Improve Market-Based SME Access to Business Development \nServices \n \n52.  BDS  have  internationally  been  proven  as  a  tool  to  enhance  competitiveness  of \nenterprises through knowledge transfer and direct application at the enterprise level. To ensure \na demand-led approach for BDS, the Government will establish the SME BSF under Article 42 \nof the Companies Ordinance, 1984. The SME BSF will be accessible for SMEs to meet a large \nvariety of knowledge-service needs to enhance their productivity and competitiveness. SMEs \nwill submit proposals for accessing the SME BSF, which will be evaluated on a first come, first \nserved basis. Services will be customized by private sector providers to meet the needs of \nSMEs and will include the development of business plans, process improvement, identification \nof markets, marketing, and product and service quality improvement. The SME BSF will be \ncreated by a private sector-led task force appointed by the Government, which will approve the \ndraft articles of association, the business plan and standard operating procedures; hire the \nfacility manager; and coordinate the legal and operational establishment. The SME BSF will be \nsupervised by its board of directors and will be subject to independent performance audits.16 \n \nc.  Improve Market-Based Access to and Delivery of SME Finance  \n \ni.  Improve Regulatory and Credit Information Infrastructure and \nBuild Private Financial Institution Capacity  \n \n53.  Improve Prudential Regulations. While aiming at prudent lending, the SBP prudential \nregulations were largely oriented toward the corporate and wealthy clientele of FIs, undermining \nthe emergence of innovative and risk-effective products and processes for service delivery to \nsmaller clients. Under the program, SBP has issued new regulations for SME and consumer \nlending to stimulate innovative services to SMEs and their clients, the consumers. SBP will \nperiodically review the impact of these prudential regulations on the uptake of lending and the \nportfolio quality of the FIs, and revise the regulations as necessary. \n \n54.  Improve Quality and Outreach of Credit Information Systems. Well-functioning and \nintegrated credit information systems provide essential information to support lending decisions \nof prospective creditors. Currently, Pakistan maintains one public and three privately owned \ncredit information systems. SBP intends to strengthen the role of private sector credit bureaus in \nbuilding the credit information infrastructure. However, international experience regarding the \nownership, information sharing, and financing of credit information systems is mixed, warranting \na  thorough  review  of  international  experience  and  domestic  conditions  before  finalizing  a \nstrategy  and  action  plan.  SBP  is  commissioning  a  World  Bank-funded study, which will \ndetermine the strategy and action plan, especially the scope and mix of accountability of private \nand public sector bureaus. Subject to the outcome of the study SBP will, in cooperation with the \n                                                 \n16 The BSF operations will be funded and managed through Subproject 2 under this SME SDP. ", "  15\nprivate sector, develop and implement an action plan for improving the quality and coverage of \nan integrated credit information system. \n \n55.  Build  Awareness  of  FIs  and  Support  Capacity  Building  for  SME  Finance. \nInternational experience suggests that innovative lending processes and products utilizing (i) a \ncombination of qualitative and quantitative skills in determining cash flow and creditworthiness \nof  borrowers,  (ii)  specific  sector  knowledge,  or  (iii)  information  from  supplier  and  buyer \nrelationships have successfully resulted in downscaling FI markets from an orientation on large \nand asset-rich customers to the large market for smaller businesses. Under the SDP, SBP will, \nas an independent broker, promote targeted awareness among FIs of SME finance processes \nand products through workshops, training on a cost-sharing basis, and assistance to FIs that \nhave demonstrated management commitment in building dedicated SME finance capacity. \n \nii.  Restructure and Privatize SME Bank \n \n56.  SBP to Terminate Special Lender of First Resort Relationship. SBP is currently the \nprimary lender to and a major shareholder of SME Bank. Under the Program, SBP, SME Bank, \nand the Government will terminate SME Bank\u2019s special relationship through immediate transfer \nof SBP\u2019s shareholding to the Government and repayment of 57.2% of SBP\u2019s outstanding loans \nto SME Bank within the first year and the remainder through repayment of 21.4% of the SBP \nloans in each of the following years of the program. \n \n57.  Government to Disengage from SME Bank Ownership. Consistent with its approach \nto financial system reform and cognizant of the important role of the private sector in serving \nSMEs, the Government supports a market-based approach refraining from directed lending to \nSMEs. Under the SDP, the Government and SME Bank management prepared a restructuring \nplan aiming at SME Bank\u2019s privatization within the 3-year program period.17 According to SME \nBank\u2019s restructuring plan, the business will be reorganized into two units: an SME business unit \nand a distressed portfolio recovery unit. Additionally, the restructuring plan includes (i) a time-\nbound action plan to reduce the number of bank branches and to rationalize staff of the \nrecovery unit to a sustainable cost level, and (ii) an independent human resource audit to: (a) \nevaluate the skills of the employees at the bank; (b) identify and match skills for specific jobs \nwithin the bank; (c) identify alternative job opportunities for employees; and (d) provide active \njob-search assistance and reemployment training for personnel. The restructuring plan entails a \npackage of sequenced operational and financial restructuring measures reducing the liabilities \nrelated to excessive unqualified staff and an excessive branch infrastructure (Appendix 3). \n \n2.  Costs and Financing Plan \n58.  Costs  of  Adjustment.  These  are  illustrated  in  Table  1  and  reflect  costs  for  the \nrestructuring and privatization of SME Bank, investment costs of FIs in building SME finance \ncapability, investment costs of SMEs in upgrading their competitiveness, and the reform and \ndevelopment  efforts  of  the  Government  and  SMEDA.  The  costs  of  adjustment  reflect  a \nsubstantial initial effort of SME Bank to downsize branch and regular staff to cut operational \ncosts of the unprofitable recovery operations, followed by a gradual rationalization of branches \nand staff. The SME Bank financial restructuring similarly reflects an upfront effort to provision \nthe nonperforming loan portfolio and repay SBP\u2019s loans. The SMEDA costs reflect an expected \n                                                 \n17 Several options were explored in detail including (i) an early liquidation and/or sale of SME Bank, (ii) the transfer of \nthe bad portfolio and staff to an asset recovery agency, and (iii) the creation of legally separate \u201cgood bank\u201d and \n\u201cbad bank\u201d entities. The Government opted for the restructuring of SME Bank followed by privatization because of \nthe political risks involved in a large upfront staff separation scheme. ", "16  \ngradual increase of its outreach program to industry clusters. The rest of the costs of adjustment \nreflect  the  FIs\u2019  investment  in  SME  capacity-building  and  lending  programs,  and  SMEs\u2019 \ninvestment  in  innovative  technology,  production,  and  marketing  processes.  The  costs  of \nadjustment under the Program are net of the project costs. \n \n \nTable 1: Estimate of Adjustment Costs \n($ million) \n \nItem  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  Total \nA.

Financing and Tranching. The Government has requested a loan of \u00a516,436.52 million \n($152 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the cost of the \nProgram. The loan will have a 15-year term including a 3-year grace period, and an interest rate \nto be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and a front-end fee of 0.5% of the \nloan amount, and other terms and conditions set out in the draft program Loan Agreement. (The \nfront-end fee for loans approved in 2003 has been reduced from 1.0% to 0.5%.) The proceeds \nwill be available for withdrawal upon satisfactory compliance with agreed conditions from the \ndate of loan effectiveness up to the loan closing date on 30 June 2007. The first tranche, in the \namount  of  \u00a53,244.05  million,  will  be  released  upon  effectiveness  of  the  loan,  subject  to \ncompliance with the first tranche conditions. The release of an incentive tranche in the same \namount is expected within 7 months of compliance with the conditions of the first tranche. The \nsecond tranche in the same amount and the third tranche comprising the remaining funds will \nbe made available upon compliance with agreed conditions and are expected in June 2005 and \nDecember 2006, respectively. The financing amounts under the Program are net of amounts \nfinanced under the Project.  \n \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n60.  Procurement  and  Disbursement.  The  program  loan  will  follow  ADB  standard \nprocedures for procurement and disbursement. Proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance \nthe full foreign exchange costs, excluding local duties and taxes, of eligible imports produced in \nand procured from ADB\u2019s member countries. All procurement under the program loan will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and undertaken through normal commercial \npractices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to ADB, with due consideration to economy and efficiency. Disbursements under the \nprogram loan will be made in line with ADB\u2018s simplified disbursement procedures and audit \nrequirements. To withdraw the proceeds of the loan, the Borrower will certify that the value of \neligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program loan ", "  17\nin a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n61.  Counterpart Funds. As part of SME SDP, it has been agreed that the Government will \ncontribute counterpart funds for the SME Bank restructuring and SMEDA\u2019s CFC program. The \nfirst  tranche  amount  will  be  utilized  for  repayment  of  SME  Bank\u2019s  liabilities  to  SBP.  The \nproceeds of the incentive tranche will be used for the further repayment of SME Bank\u2019s liabilities \nto SBP and reimbursement to SME Bank for the expenditures related to staff separation. The \nproceeds of the second and third tranches will cover adjustment cost related to SME Bank staff \nseparation  and  include  earmarking  of  up  to $6 million equivalent each for SMEDA\u2019s CFC \nprogram. The borrower will certify the utilization of counterpart funds in line with the Loan \nAgreement  through  audited  statements  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  other  implementation \narrangements for the program and project loans are under Section E below. \n \nD.  The Project \n \n1.  Components and Outputs \n62.  The SME Sector Development Project supports the implementation of policy reforms \nand the building of a market-based infrastructure for BDS and financial services to SMEs and is \nstructured in three subprojects. Details of the rationale, scope, and approach of each of the \nsubprojects are described in Appendixes 4, 5, and 6. The costs and financing are summarized \nin Appendix 7 and implementation arrangements are detailed in Appendix 8.  \n \nSubproject 1:   Policy Formulation and Implementation \nComponent 1.1:  SME Policy Development \nComponent 1.2:  Labor Protection and Inspection Policy Development \n \nSubproject 2:   SME Business Support Fund \n \nSubproject 3:   Market Development for SME Finance \nComponent 3.1:  Regulatory Policy Development, Credit Information, and Capacity \nBuilding for Financial Institutions \nComponent 3.2:  SME Bank Restructuring \n \na.  Subproject 1: Policy Formulation and Implementation \n \n63.  The purpose of the subproject is to assist the Government to develop the SME policy \n(Ministry of Industries and Production [MOIP] supported by SMEDA for component 1.1), and the \nLabor Protection and Inspection Policies (Ministry of Labour [MOL] for component 1.2) and to \nestablish state-of-the-art processes for participatory preparation of the policies, topic-specific \npolicy advisory groups involving all stakeholders, and awareness building and dissemination at \nthe provincial and local levels utilizing local language. Project component 1.1 will as well support \nSMEDA in the establishment and analysis of an SME database for annual updating to monitor \npolicy reform impact (Appendix 4). \n \nb.  Subproject 2: SME Business Support Fund \n \n64.  The subproject will establish the SME BSF as a company within three months of loan \neffectiveness, with a nine-member board led by private sector members and composed of at \nleast six representatives from the private sector. The fund will provide SMEs with direct access ", "18  \nto market-based knowledge services to enhance their productivity and competitiveness. The \nutilization will be demand driven and SMEs will access the funds on a cost-sharing basis after \ntheir  proposals  have  gone  through  scrutiny  by  a  dedicated  facility  management  team.  In \nsupporting the SME applicants, the BSF will utilize and effectively leverage the knowledge \nservices available in the private sector and thus stimulate the downscaling of the market for \nbusiness advisory services to the level of SMEs. \n \n65.  The design and establishment of the SME BSF has utilized best practice in emerging \nmarkets. The legal and governance structure of the SME BSF is modeled after the Poverty \nAlleviation Fund, which is successfully managed under the leadership of the private sector, with \nparticipation of NGOs and the Government. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will establish the \nSME  BSF  based  on  its  own  experience  gained  with  this  model.  Besides  having  sound \nmanagement experience, it is critical that the management of the SME BSF applies strong \nprofessional ethics including rules dealing with conflict of interest, the separation of business \norigination and management, and the external recruitment of an experienced facility manger. \nThese arrangements will not only serve to establish a strong governance environment within the \nBSF, but will also be critical for the reputation of the SME BSF among the public as an \naccessible institution serving the needs of the clients. Under the PPTA, memorandum and \narticles of association were drafted and a business plan and standard operating procedures \nprepared and reviewed by MOF (Appendix 5).   \n \nc.  Subproject 3: Market Development for SME Finance\u2014Component  3.1 \n \n66.  The objective of this subproject component is to increase SMEs\u2019 access to finance \nthrough the private sector. The component focuses on (i) developing a conducive regulatory and \npolicy environment for SME finance, (ii) encouraging FIs to develop SME lending capability, and \n(iii) providing capacity building to PFIs committed to establish SME finance units (Appendix 6).   \n \n67.  Developing a Conducive Regulatory and Policy Environment for SME Finance. In \norder to have a well-functioning financial system for SME lending, regulations, supervision, and \nmonitoring of the FIs must be improved and FIs\u2019 policies and procedures for SME lending must \nbe introduced. To improve their ability in performing proper credit analysis on SMEs, more \ncomprehensive credit information must be provided to FIs. Additionally, to enhance SME access \nto credit, the legal framework for secured transactions will be reviewed and developed. A \nbanking regulation and supervision expert with extensive experience in SMEs will assist in the \nreview of SBP\u2019s regulations, supervision, and approach to the SME segment. \n \n68.  Encouraging FIs to Develop SME Lending Capability. Commercial SME finance is \nrelatively new in Pakistan. Capacity building on SME finance will be offered to both SBP and \nFIs. Seminars and workshops will be conducted by experts on the strategies and methods of \nestablishing  SME  finance  capability  at  the  FIs.  This  entails  market  research,  product \ndevelopment, lending processes, control systems, and capacity building of professional staff. \nAdvisory support will also be provided to assist FIs in developing SME business strategies. \n \n69.  Customized Capacity Building of FIs. FIs committed to establish an SME financing \nunit may qualify for consulting services by submitting a business plan for approval to SBP and \nADB. Upon approval of the FI\u2019s business plan, the FI will obtain consulting services on a cost-\nsharing basis to implement the business plan and establish the SME finance capability. This \nactivity may also prepare FIs for participation in the PCG facility described in Section F. \n \n ", "  19\nd.  Subproject 3: Market Development for SME Finance\u2014Component 3.2 \n \n70.  This component will assist SME Bank with the implementation of its restructuring plan, \nand provide expertise to (i) identify market niches for SME Bank, (ii) establish lending policies \nand procedures, (iii) develop financial products, (iv) develop marketing strategies to enhance \noutreach, and (v) develop sound risk management through appropriate incentives for staff, \ncontrols, and sound management information systems. SME Bank will have an international \nexpert as head of its new SME business unit, who will assist in building up the commercial SME \nbusiness including the deposit and lending products. A committee composed of representatives \nof SME Bank and core program management unit (CPMU) will select the expert (Appendix 6). \n \n2.  Cost and Financing \n71.  Amounts and Terms. The total project costs are estimated at $28 million equivalent. \nThe Government has requested a loan of SDR12.501 million ($18 million equivalent) including \n$7.91 equivalent in foreign exchange and $10.09 million equivalent in domestic currency to help \nfinance the Project. The remainder of the cost will be borne by the Government and the private \nsector SMEs and FIs through fees and cost-sharing arrangements. The project loan will be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years, interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, \nand other terms and conditions set out in the draft project Loan Agreement. The Project has a 5-\nyear duration and the closing date will be 30 June 2009. The proceeds of the project loan will be \npassed on in the following manner: (i) as a budgetary allocation to MOL ($350,000 equivalent, \nComponent  1.2),  and  MOF  (CPMU)  ($960,000  equivalent);  and  (ii)  as  a  grant  to  SBP \n($8,000,000 equivalent, Component 3.1), SMEDA ($200,000 equivalent, Component 1.1), SME \nBSF ($7,190,000 equivalent, Component 2), and SME Bank ($800,000 equivalent, Component \n3.2). \n \nTable 2.

Procurement and Consulting Services \n72.  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines for \nProcurement as described in Appendix 8. Procurement will be limited to office equipment and a \nvehicle  estimated  at  a  total  of  $71,800  equivalent,  which  will  be  procured  under  direct \nprocurement procedures. All consultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \nGovernment  requested  that  domestic  consultants  may  be  required  to  collaborate  with \ninternational consultants. The consulting services under component 3.1 require an innovative \napproach  to  awareness  building,  and  identification  of  PFIs  and  PFI  senior  management \ncommitment  of  their  SME  finance  business  plans,  before  assistance  packages  can  be \ncustomized. Since there is no standardized approach for delivery of such services and since the \ntasks of developing systems, lending processes, and procedures for SME finance are complex \nand require highly specialized skills and a significant degree of flexibility in the allocation of \nexpertise, the quality-based selection method will be applied for the capacity-building portion of \nthis component (Table 3, 3.1b,). Since the participating FIs will be identified in the awareness-\nbuilding  process  through  short-term  consultants,  the  requisite  terms  of  reference  and \nspecialized skills will be customized to the needs of the individual PFI. It is expected that up to \nfour PFIs will benefit from the capacity-building measures. All other consulting positions will be \nadvertised and selected on an individual basis as set out in Table 3.  \n \nTable 3.

Implementation Arrangements for the Sector Development Program \n \n1.  Program and Project Management Oversight \n73.   Because  of  the  linkage  of  reforms  in  the  program  and  project  activities,  strong \nimplementation and coordination arrangements will be put in place.  The TA grant described \nunder Section IV will provide for a domestic full-time specialist allocated to ADB\u2019s Pakistan \nResident Mission to support the coordination of the SDP. The implementation responsibilities \nare detailed in Appendix 8. The following entities will implement the SDP: \n \n(i)  the steering committee; \n(ii)  the CPMU representing MOF as the Executing Agency (EA); and ", "  21\n(iii)  the implementing agencies (IAs) (MOF, MOIP, MOL, SBP, SMEDA, and SME \nBank), as well as the BSF upon incorporation as a nonprofit company. \n \n74.  Steering Committee. The steering committee will be chaired by the Minister of Finance \nand consist of the secretaries of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Statistics; MOF; MOIP; \nMOL; and the deputy governor of SBP. The steering committee will establish a stakeholder \nreview process for ensuring adequate private sector feedback on the policy outputs; and \nestablish an audit review process for ensuring adequate performance review and addressing \nissues  raised  in  audits  of  the  program,  including  compliance  with  policy  conditions,  loan \ncovenants. The financial and performance audits will be conducted by a firm associated with an \ninternationally recognized auditing firm based on terms of reference and a shortlist agreed with \nADB. \n \n2.  Program and Project Management Coordination \n75.  CPMU. A permanent CPMU representing the MOF as the EA will be established to \nassure that reforms are well managed, coordinated, and communicated among government \nagencies and private sector stakeholders. In addition to its oversight and coordination functions, \nthe CPMU will also act as the IA for (i) the SME Bank restructuring component, (ii) the initial \nsetup of the SME BSF, and (iii) the TA grant to support program coordination. The CPMU will \nmaintain the following functions: (i) focal point for ADB and consultants; (ii) lead coordinator of \nIAs and private sector stakeholders; (iii) lead program monitoring, management, and reporting; \nand (iv) ensuring adequacy and timely availability of counterpart funding. \n \n76.  The CPMU comprises six full-time staff, including (i) the program director, who will be a \njoint secretary and will directly report to the steering committee; (ii) manager, SME policy and \nlabor policy development, in charge of supporting and overseeing the development of policy \nreform  initiatives  and  related  project  components  under  outcome  1;  (iii)  manager,  BDS \ndevelopment,  in  charge  of  supporting  and  overseeing  the  development  of  policy  reform \ninitiatives  and  related  project  components  under  outcome  2;  (iv)  manager,  SME  Bank \nrestructuring in charge of overseeing the complex downsizing and business building process for \nSME Bank, including the Government\u2019s divestiture from SME Bank under outcome 3; and (v) \ntwo  research  analysts,  in  charge  of  providing  analytical  support  for  policy  analysis,  data \nresearch, program monitoring and reporting, and implementation support as necessary. All staff \nexcept the program director will be recruited in a competitive process from the market and will \nbe financed under the project loan. \n \n3.  Program and Project Implementation Units \n77.  The SDP will be implemented by the following IAs: \n \n78.  IA 1\u2014SMEDA. MOIP will appoint its secretary to oversee the implementation of the \nfollowing tasks to be performed by SMEDA and coordinated by SMEDA\u2019s chief executive officer, \nwho will act as project director (PD-IA 1): \n \n(i)  SME policy development, including the composition of an SME policy document \nin a consultative process with SME stakeholders and the implementation of such \npolicy  (KRA  1.1).  Project  component  1.1  will  provide  consulting  services  to \nsupport this initiative; and  \n(ii)  enhancement of SMEDA\u2019s effectiveness and outreach to SMEs (KRA 1.3). \n ", "22  \n79.  IA 2\u2014MOL has established a team chaired by a joint secretary at MOL, as project \ndirector (PD-IA 2), and adviser at MOL as coordinator supported by 3 professional staff to carry \nout  the  development  of  the  labor  protection  and  inspection  policies  (KRA  1.2)  and  to \ndisseminate these to, and develop consensus at, the provincial level. MOL will obtain periodical \nsupport from an international labor policy specialist and full-time support from a domestic \nconsultant recruited under project component 1.2. \n \n80.  IA 3\u2014MOF/BSF. Project director CPMU will be in charge on a limited time basis to \nfacilitate the selection and appointment of a task force to incorporate the BSF and select board \nof directors in charge of overseeing the operations of the SME BSF (KRA 2), approve the \nmemorandum of association, the business plan and standard operating procedures. \n \n81.  The SME BSF will implement program KRA 2 and project component 2 and its board will \nrecruit an internationally experienced facility manager through a competitive process supported \nby  domestically  recruited  professional staff as determined in the BSF business plan; and \noversee the SME BSF\u2019s business. The SME BSF will establish a unit, comprising the facility \nmanager/project director (PD-IA 3) on a full-time basis and will be in charge of managing the \npreparation and implementation of the BSF operations, including the (i) compliance of tranche \nrelease conditions, and (ii) ensuring timely recruitment of experts and management of experts\u2019 \noutputs.  \n \n82.  IA 4\u2014SBP has established a unit to carry out the following tasks: \n \n(i)  lead the development of SME finance policy, institutional support infrastructure \nfor credit enhancements for SMEs, and analysis of the private sector banks\u2019 \nresponse to the policies (KRA 3.1); \n(ii)  implement project component 3.1 supporting SME regulatory policy development \nand the development of supporting information infrastructure; and promoting \nawareness  among  commercial  bankers  for  commercial  approaches  to  SME \nfinance and promote investment of banks into building dedicated SME units; and  \n(iii)  oversee, in its function as regulator, the restructuring of SME Bank. \n \n83.  IA 4 comprises a project director and three full-time staff in charge of (i) training and \nknowledge management, (ii) SME finance capacity building, (iii) monitoring of relevant tranche \nrelease conditions, and (iv) ensuring timely recruitment and management of consultants and \ntheir outputs.  \n \n84.  IA 5\u2014MOF. The CPMU will maintain the function of the IA overseeing the restructuring \nof SME Bank from the perspective as its owner. The CPMU will specifically: \n \n(i)  oversee the restructuring process; \n(ii)  recruit experts supporting the restructuring process; \n(iii)  coordinate with IA 4 to ensure adequate coordination of restructuring measures \nand participation in the training measures offered to commercial banks; and \n(iv)  monitor implementation of the restructuring plan and restructuring targets  and \nagreement between the Government and SBP, terminating all loans to and \nshareholding in SME Bank. \n ", "  23\n4.  Monitoring, Performance Management, and Auditing \n85.  Monitoring. To monitor implementation of the Program and the Project, the EA through \nthe CPMU will liaise closely with the IAs, collect information from the IAs and other relevant \nsources, and prepare quarterly progress reports as well as an annual report. The CPMU will \nestablish a performance monitoring system during inception of the Project. Within 3 months of \ncompletion,  the  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  completion  reports  providing  a  detailed \nevaluation of the SDP design, costs, consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, \nand other details as may be requested by ADB. \n \n86.  Accounting  and  Auditing.  The  EA  and  IAs  will  establish  and  maintain  separate \naccounts for the SDP components in accordance with accounting and  financial management \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Imprest accounts will be established for each of MOF, SBP, and \nSMEDA as described in Appendix 8.  The steering committee will commission financial and \nperformance audits of the CPMU and IAs and their accounts in accordance with auditing \nstandards acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited accounts and financial statements \nand the reports of the auditors will be submitted to ADB in English within 6 months of the end of \neach fiscal year. The CPMU will ensure that each IA submits reports on a timely basis and will \nconsolidate the reports for transmission to ADB. \n \nF.  Partial Credit Guarantee Facility \n \n1.  Rationale and Objective \n87.  Rationale.  As  described  under  Section  II  B5,  \u201cIssues  and  Opportunities,\u201d  the \nintroduction of market-based products enhancing the channeling of existing liquidity of the \nfinancial system to SME lending is a key innovation supported under the SDP. ADB\u2019s PCG \nfacility, which in partnership with selected PFIs shares the credit risks and rewards associated \nwith SME lending, will raise the comfort level of PFIs by (i) leveraging the PFIs\u2019 resources, (ii) \nassisting PFIs to develop client relationships with smaller SME clients, and (iii) introducing \ninternational good practice for SME lending to Pakistan. The PCG facility will initially draw on \ninternational FIs based in Pakistan, which have experience in SME lending in other emerging \nmarkets. Once ADB has gained initial experience with the PCG, domestic FIs are expected to \nfollow the international FIs and develop similar methodologies for SME lending.  \n \n88.  Objective of the PCG Facility. The objective of the PCG facility under the SDP is \ntwofold: first, to leverage through a market-based approach existing financial resources of the \nfinancial system for lending to an SME segment currently underserved by FIs; and second, to \nprovide catalytic support for innovative financial products and approaches in new and less \nfamiliar markets. Once successfully tested with PFIs, such products will be expanded among a \nlarger number of FIs. The expected outcome of the PCG facility is a higher volume of SME \nlending by commercial FIs in Pakistan. Details of the PCG facility are in Appendix 9. \n \n2.  Facility Design \n89.  Structure. ADB will share with PFIs, identified by ADB in a due diligence process, the \ncredit risk of SME loans. ADB will issue PCGs to PFIs to guarantee repayment of an agreed \nportion of a loan portfolio. The PCGs will have agreed cover amounts and time frames to be \nselected following a due diligence process. The PCGs will detail the risk- and reward-sharing \narrangements for individual loans within a defined portfolio of loans extended by the PFIs to \nSMEs.  The  loan  portfolio  covered  under  each  PCG  may  be  revolving,  and  the  portfolio ", "24  \ncomposition may change over time based on lending decisions of the PFI as agreed with ADB. \nADB will not be involved in the lending decisions of the PFIs, but will agree with the PFIs on the \nlending selection and risk management process. To underscore the market approach, the PCG \nfacility  will  be  provided  through  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  without  government \ncounterguarantee. Terms and conditions will be market based. \n \n90.  Scope. The PCG facility is proposed to have an overall limit of $65 million. PCGs will be \nissued for each PFI based on demand and prudent practices, starting with lower amounts that \ncan be gradually increased within the overall PCG facility limit. Sublimits will be set at up to $20 \nmillion equivalent for each PFI. Risk sharing with PFIs will take place on two levels on an \nindividual loan basis. First, a first loss limit will be defined that will be fully absorbed by the PFI. \nThe first loss will be a function of the strength of the financial institution, its past SME lending \nhistory, and its risk management systems. The level of first loss may be fixed between 0% for \nstrong institutions with an established track record up to 30% for new market entrants. Second, \nany loss in excess of the first loss will be shared with the PFI at an agreed rate, normally 50%.  \n \n91.  Prudent Phasing-in and Close Monitoring. Since the product is new both in Pakistan \nand for ADB, the PCG facility will commence operation with commercial FIs that have well-\nestablished  underwriting  procedures  of  an ni ternational standard and experience in similar \nlending methodologies elsewhere, before expanding to domestic FIs. Likewise, the portfolio of \nguaranteed loans will expand gradually. The tenor of guaranteed loans will be limited to 36 \nmonths, although initially the PCG will be targeted at shorter maturities. Once ADB is satisfied \nwith the track record of the PFI and its SME borrowers, portfolio targets may be revised to \nencourage PFIs to expand further to riskier segments. \n \n92.  Guarantee limits with  PFIs will be in US dollar terms under each PCG, but PFIs will \nextend loans to SMEs under the PCGs in local currency. Any risk as a result of currency \nfluctuations beyond the US dollar PCG limit for each PFI will be for the account of the PFI, since \nADB\u2019s risk exposure will be capped with the dollar amount to be specified in the guarantee \nagreement with each PFI. The PCG facility will be available for issuance of PCGs to PFIs for 5 \nyears from the expected date of ADB approval, until 31 December 2008. \n \n93.  SMEs supported under the facility will be for example suppliers and vendors maintaining \nbusiness with corporate clients of the PFIs, in industries that have reasonably integrated supply \nchain structures, such as the pharmaceutical, automobile, engineering, and consumer goods \nindustries. For example, corporate entities in the pharmaceutical industry provide their products \nto about 200 pharmacies in Karachi alone. Many of these pharmacies have an annual business \nturnover of about PRs50 million to PRs150 million, but currently face constraints in accessing \nworking capital. Larger pharmacies, wholesale distributors, and hospitals usually do not have \ndifficulty in accessing credit. It is envisaged that most SMEs included in the guaranteed loan \nportfolio will not have a borrowing relationship with the PFI prior to the PCG agreement. The \nrelation between the PFI and the SME may be established either through (i) confirmation of the \nPFI\u2019s corporate client that the SME is one of its suppliers, vendors, or established clients; or (ii) \na guarantee of the corporate client on behalf of the SME. Existing SME clients of the PFI may \nalso be included if this entails an increase in their credit limit. Direct relationships of PFIs with \nSME clients are also encouraged within an agreed lending approach. PCGs issued to PFIs will \nbe limited to SME loan portfolios. All financially sound FIs in Pakistan established in the private \nsector are eligible to access the facility, subject to a satisfactory due diligence result. \n \n94.  Pricing. The PFI will pay to ADB a predetermined fee either as a fixed rate based on the \nPFIs\u2019 profit in lending to SMEs in the agreed portfolio and reviewed semiannually, or as a ", "  25\nvariable rate reflecting the PFIs\u2019 profit as documented in the PFIs\u2019 financial statements. The fee \nwill be market based and determined for each PFI based on the risks identified during the due \ndiligence process and the risk-sharing mechanism agreed between ADB and the PFI, as \napproved by ADB\u2019s Guarantee Committee chaired by the Office of Cofinancing Operations. In \naccordance with market practice no front-end fee will be charged. \n \n3.  Implementation and Monitoring \n95.  Guarantee Agreements, Reporting, and Management by ADB. ADB will enter into \nPCG agreements with each PFI, which will define the portfolio to be covered including the PFI\u2019s \nSME target benchmarks and the loss limit for that PCG. The conditions of each PCG will be \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis based on the due diligence of the PFI and its SME lending \nprocesses and operations. Terms and conditions for each PCG will be detailed in a term sheet \nin line with the parameters described in this RRP, subject to review by ADB\u2019s Guarantee \nCommittee and procedures detailed in a Guarantee Administration Memorandum (GAM) prior to \nits  finalization.  Each  PCG  agreement  will  follow  a  standardized  format  and  detail  the \nrequirement for quarterly reporting, as well as prompt information on any potential losses or \ndefaults in the portfolio. ADB will monitor the utilization of the PCG facility through semiannual \non-site review of the PFIs\u2019 exposure to SMEs, especially the portfolio quality underwritten by the \nPFIs and the PFIs\u2019 meeting of agreed business targets of providing credit to additional lower \nsegments  of  SMEs  as  reflected  in  the  agreed  business  plans,  and  will  allow  monitoring \ncompliance with negative lists. ADB has the option to modify existing guarantee parameters, \nwith adequate notice, or suspend new SME loan inclusions under the guaranteed portfolio.  \n \n96.  Guarantee Administration Memorandum. The GAM will be prepared by the South \nAsia Department and set out the respective responsibilities of ADB departments concerned \n(Office of Cofinancing Operations; Office of the General Counsel; Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department; Pakistan Resident Mission; Private Sector Operations Department; \nand Governance, Finance and Trade Division, South Asia Department) in the selection of PFIs \nand management of the facility, including developmental and commercial aspects, and the \nestablishment of an environment management system as prescribed in ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy. \n \n97.  Loss  Determination,  Adjustment,  and  Claims  Payment. Risks guaranteed under \neach PCG are losses, in accordance with the agreed loss-sharing ratios, which result from \nirrecoverable  principal  and  interest  payment  default  on  loans  included  in  the  guaranteed \nportfolio.  Losses  are  determined  by  the  PFI  in  a  transparent  manner,  which  will  include \nappropriate documentation of defaults of loans included in the guaranteed portfolio. ADB will \nreimburse the PFI for the guaranteed percentage of losses arising from guaranteed risks. \nClaims will be paid in Pakistan rupees, subject to the US dollar limit of the PCG for that PFI.  \n \n98.  Safeguard Policies. The PCG facility is classified as \u201cFinancial Intermediary\u201d for the \npurpose  of  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies.  ADB  will  establish  an  environment \nmanagement system, which will be detailed in the GAM and specified for each PFI under the \nguarantee agreement to ensure PFIs\u2019 adherence to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) as well as to ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary \nresettlement, indigenous peoples, and procurement. The GAM will also require PFIs under the \nguarantee agreements to acknowledge in progress reports that all  borrowers comply with \nhealth, safety, and environmental regulations and standards as well as public consultation \nrequirements applicable in Pakistan. Since the PFIs\u2019 loans to SMEs will be largely in the trade \nand light-manufacturing sector, it is unlikely that involuntary resettlement or detrimental impacts ", "26  \non indigenous peoples will occur. As for environmental safeguards, ADB\u2019s due diligence will \nidentify areas for remedy, including negative lists and training as necessary. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n99.  The TA will assist the Government and private sector stakeholders in the coordination of \nthe SDP reforms. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $315,000 equivalent, all in local \ncurrency. ADB  will provide $250,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA \nprogram to cover part of the local currency cost of the TA. The Government will provide the \nremaining  $65,000  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  offices,  transportation,  and \nincidental expenses. The TA will be implemented over 45 months. An individual consultant will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants (Appendix 10). \n \n100.  ADB Implementation Arrangements. In addition to the consultant, ADB will support \nprogram implementation through a team including (i) a full-time professional staff person to be \nlocated at the Pakistan Resident Mission in charge of the day-to-day coordination of the SDP; \n(ii)  the  mission  leader  located  in  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Regional  Department;  and  (iii)  team \nmembers from the Private Sector Operations Department, Office of Cofinancing Operations, \nand the Office of the General Counsel to support implementation of the PCG facility. ADB will \nconduct jointly with the Government at least semiannual reviews. \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n \n101.  Policy.  BDS  and  financial  services  directly  enhance  SME  competitiveness  and \nproductivity, which have a direct positive impact on SME profitability and favorably impact job \nsecurity and employment creation. The private sector BDS providers and the FIs will be able to \nfavorably respond to policy reforms under the SDP. The SDP provides the framework for \ndeveloping a consistent SME policy and provides a critical linkage of reforms with knowledge \nenhancement and financial resource flow to SMEs. The SDP also supports the creation of a \nlevel playing field in the financial sector through privatization of SME Bank and termination of \nSBP\u2019s special relationship with SME Bank, consistent with SBP\u2019s role of a regulator and the \nprivatization efforts under the financial sector reform program. A strong CPMU supports the \nimplementation of a consultative approach of policy development, and close coordination with \nstakeholders and within the Government. The policy reforms will: \n \n(i)  determine  the  role  of  the  Government  and  the  private  sector  in  SME \ndevelopment  by  limiting  the  role  of  the  Government  to  policy  setting  and \nfacilitation, and supporting development of service markets by the private sector; \n(ii)  set a standard for labor protection and inspection for employers and employees \nthrough acknowledgment of basic labor rights, enhancing labor productivity, and \nreducing interference and costs of doing business through a policy of least \nintervention by the Government; \n(iii)  focus public sector institutions on policy support and facilitation; \n(iv)  improve access of SMEs to BDS; \n(v)  improve the FIs\u2019 capacity and financial resource flow to serve SMEs; and \n(vi)  terminate SME Bank\u2019s role in the public sector through privatization. \n ", "  27\n102.  Institutional. The SDP will support the rationalization and restructuring of two public \nsector institutions, SMEDA and SME Bank. SMEDA will, under the Program, follow a business \nplan to expand its outreach and policy support to SMEs, and its management will benefit from \nbusiness rules enhancing its accountability for day-to-day operations. SME Bank will go through \na substantial rationalization effort to reduce excessive cost and contingent liabilities to the \nGovernment, and start building the foundations for a viable bank followed by its privatization. \n \n103.  Outreach to Beneficiaries. SMEs in both the informal and formal sectors will be the \nbeneficiaries of the SDP. It is estimated that about 8,000 SMEs will benefit from the operations \nof  the  BSF  over  the  5-year program period. It is expected that through the SME finance \ncapacity-building program, four commercial FIs will establish dedicated SME finance units and \nwill be able to benefit about 30,000 SMEs over the project implementation period. This will \nsecure and generate substantial employment. \n \n104.  Safeguards.  Since  the  major  thrust  of  the  SDP  is  on  capacity  building  and  no \nconstruction is involved, the SME SDP will not have adverse impacts on resettlement and \nindigenous  peoples  and  the  environment  and  will  thus  not  trigger  mitigating  measures  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s policies on indigenous peoples and on involuntary resettlement. Staff \nretrenchment at SME Bank will be addressed through severance packages, job counseling, and \nretraining to facilitate the reemployment of redundant staff. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Supplementary Appendix 2. \n \n105.  With regard to the PCG facility, the compliance of the PFIs with ADB\u2019s safeguard \npolicies will be examined at due diligence of each PFI. However, because of the short-term \nnature of the loans guaranteed and the negative list applied, it is unlikely that the interventions \nunder the PCG facility will trigger actions under ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n106.  The program design makes a number of assumptions with varying degrees of risk. It is \nassumed  that  Pakistan  will  not  suffer  from  any  adverse  geopolitical  changes  affecting  its \nexternal and internal stability. Furthermore, the Government is expected to remain strongly \ncommitted to the reforms undertaken since 1997, supporting the poverty orientation of public \nexpenditure, the promotion of SMEs, and financial sector reforms. So far the Government has \ndemonstrated strong ownership and maintains high priority for the development of SMEs. \n \n107.  The reforms involve a number of agencies and the private sector. The implementation \nrisks have been addressed through the establishment of strong oversight, implementation, \ncoordination, and governance provisions in the implementation framework. Reforms will be \nimplemented through agencies experienced with other complex reform programs, while the \nestablishment of a CPMU at MOF will ensure that implementation risks are properly managed.  \n \n108.  Credibility of the reforms in the private sector and in society at large is essential. The \nprogram  design  mitigates  the  risk  through  the  establishment  of  task  forces  representing \nstakeholders  and  through  awareness  building  and  consultation  mechanisms  in  developing \npolicy and disseminating the content. Public sector institutions also bear a risk of low public \ncredibility and of politicization. To reduce this risk, lead institutions such as SMEDA will prepare \nand implement business plans, which are shared with the public. SME Bank will prepare and \nimplement a restructuring plan followed by a privatization plan, which will be shared with the \npublic once it is finalized. Support for public and private sector institutions under the SDP will be \nsubject to scrutiny by of the steering committee and to regular performance audits. ", "28  \n109.  SME Bank has been a politicized organization and staff values could adversely affect \nrestructuring  and  privatization.  Autonomy  of  management  could  be  eroded  and  expected \nimprovements in operations may not materialize. To mitigate these risks, the Government will \nagree to a restructuring plan, which involves a substantial upfront rationalization of staff and \nthus reduction of operational costs. In addition, credit management will be strengthened through \nthe appointment of a new head for the SME business unit, which will lead the buildup of the new \noperations. Recruitment for the new business operations of SME Bank will be done in a \ntransparent manner through the market. Support is also made contingent on the performance of \nand emphasis on operational restructuring and the tranching of the loan. \n \n110.  Overall program risks have been mitigated through utilization of a number of institutions, \npredominantly in the private sector. The use of institutions such as private sector FIs or private \nBDS providers puts the program foundation on a broader basis and thereby reduces the risk if \nan institution fails to deliver. The Program also adopts an approach of pilot testing BDS and \nfinancial services before rollout, thereby lessening the risk of failure. Finally, the SDP builds on \nexisting initiatives of other funding agencies and thereby reduces the complexity of the Program. \nAn overview of funding agency activities is in Supplementary Appendix 3. \n \nVI.

Legal  Framework,  Ownership  and  Basic  Objectives.  On  1  January  2002  the \nGovernment  merged  two  failed  development  finance  institutions  (DFIs),  the  Regional \nDevelopment Finance Corporation and the Small Business Finance Corporation into SME Bank, \na public limited company, pursuant to the RDFC and SBFC Amalgamation and Conversion \nOrdinance 2001. SME Bank inherited PRs9.5 billion of nonperforming loans (the \u201cold portfolio\u201d). \nThe Bank\u2019s main function is to provide term credit to SMEs. Despite its mandate, loan exposure \nis only 0.5% of the total SME loans provided by the banking system. Seriously undermined by \nthe burden inherited from its precursor institutions, its operations have never been profitable. \nThe Government believes that it is vital that SME Bank continues to provide financing to SMEs, \nespecially to the underserved lower end of SMEs with annual revenues of up to PRs100 million \nand maximum loan size of PRs10 million. \n \n2.  Ownership and Management. The share ownership of SME Bank was determined by \nthe proportional amount of ownership by the shareholders in Regional Development Finance \nCorporation and Small Business Finance Corporation and the net asset values of the two banks \nas of 31 December 2001. The total authorized share capital is PRs10 billion consisting of PRs1 \nbillion  of  ordinary  shares  of  PRs10  each.  Through  direct  ownership\u201457.1%\u2014and  indirect \nownership\u2014(State Bank of Pakistan [SBP] 12.8%), National Bank of Pakistan (2.6%), and \nHabib Bank (8.2%)\u2014the Government owns the majority of the Bank. The board of directors \nconsists of seven members including the chief executive officer, two government officials, two \npresidents of state-owned banks, and two presidents of privatized banks. The management \nconsists of the president and seven executive directors. Means available to the management for \nassessing liquidity, interest rate, and credit risks are weak.  \n \n3.  Organization and Staffing. From its head office in Islamabad, SME Bank operates four \nprovincial  offices  and  59  branches,  and  a  leasing  subsidiary  with  seven  branches.  Most \nbranches are used for loan recovery. The Bank inherited approximately 1,000 employees with \nregular employment status, of which almost none have proper lending skills. About 900 of the \nemployees  have  been  assigned  to  recover  loans  from  the  old  portfolio.  Despite  their  low \nqualifications, the staff benefit from above-market salary and benefit packages and can be \nconsidered SME Bank\u2019s largest liability. Since there has been only a limited change in staff, \nrecent operations have shown that the proportion of classified loans of the new loan portfolio \nhas substantially increased. It is assumed that portfolio quality will  further deteriorate unless a \nsignificant change is introduced.  \n \n4.  Lending Policies and Procedures. SME Bank provides term loans of up to 7 years, at \nan average term of 3 years and an average size of about PRs0.4 million. Branches and regional \noffices have loan approval authority ranging up to PRs0.2 million and from PRs0.2 million\u20130.3 \nmillion to PRs2.0 million, respectively, while headquarters approves all other loans. Loans are \nprimarily approved on the basis of collateral. There is no formal policy for offering differential \ninterest rates based on the client\u2019s credit rating, term, or type of lending. The average interest \nrate for all loans is about 13%. Based on the bank\u2019s cost of funds, historical loan defaults, and \nrecovery, it is believed that the loans are priced at a loss. SME Bank\u2019s income recognition and \nprovisioning for bad debts are in compliance with SBP prudential regulations. For loans more \nthan 90 days overdue, the income accrual is suspended and the loans are categorized as \u201cother \nassets especially mentioned.\u201d Long-term loans delinquent for more than 365 days are classified \nas substandard, 730 days as doubtful, and above 3 years as loss. SBP requires that provisions \nbe made for 20% of substandard accounts, 50% for doubtful debts, and 100% for the loss \ncategory. Provisioning for loan losses as of year-end 2002 was PRs6.7 billion or 76% of the old \nportfolio. Recoveries from the old portfolio amounted to PRs1.4 billion over SME Bank\u2019s 18 \nmonths until June 2003, and 11% of the new portfolio are classified loans only after 18 months \n ", "40  Appendix 3 \nof operation. SME Bank\u2019s portfolio quality has been affected by (i) weak loan appraisal, (ii) \nabsence of credit risk management, and (iii) inadequate internal audit controls.

The SME Bank board of directors and the Government \ndecided that it is necessary to restructure SME Bank, since (i) its operation is not sustainable; \n(ii) there is a need to meet the demand for financial services for the underserved lower end of \nthe SMEs; and (iii) the bank\u2019s financial weakness deters SME lending. To determine the scope \nof the restructuring, an audit was performed by Taseer Hadi Khalid & Co., a firm associated with \nKPMG.  The  plan  indicates  that  operating  self-sufficiency  of  banking  operations  could  be \nobtained by implementing a plan, which includes substantial reductions in the number of regular \nstaff and branches. The Government and SME Bank management prepared a restructuring plan \naiming at SME Bank\u2019s privatization within a 3-year period. The business will be reorganized into \nan SME business unit and a distressed portfolio recovery unit. Additionally, the plan includes (i) \na time-bound action plan to reduce the number of bank branches and rationalize staff of the \nrecovery unit to a sustainable cost level; and (ii) an independent human resources audit to (a) \nevaluate the skills of the employees at the bank; (b) identify and match skills for specific jobs \nwithin the bank; (c) identify alternative job opportunities for employees; and (d) provide job-\nsearch assistance and reemployment training for personnel.

Component 1.1: Small and Medium Enterprise Policy Development \n \n1.  Background and Rationale \n \n1.  Pakistan\u2019s poverty reduction strategy has explicitly identified the small and medium \nenterprise (SME) sector as one with strong potential for poverty reduction. A developed and \nappropriately  supported  SME  sector  can  facilitate  poverty  reduction  by  generating  new \nenterprises, employment, and labor productivity, thereby increasing competitiveness, improving \nincome distribution, broadening the accumulation of  wealth, and cushioning business cycle \neffects.  It  is  essential  to  develop  an  SME  policy  to  recognize  and  promote  appropriate \nmechanisms by which the poverty-reduction impact of SME promotion can be maximized. The \nMinistry  of  Industries  and  Production  (MOIP)  through  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment Authority (SMEDA) has taken on the mandate to prepare the SME policy. The \nSME policy will reflect the Government\u2019s objective of encouraging SME development and \ncompetitiveness, by specifying the role of the private and public sectors in SME development \nand institutionalizing SME support. \n \n2.  Task Force. The SME policy will require inputs from a wide range of stakeholders. To \ndevelop the SME policy, MOIP will establish a task force (TF) chaired by the Secretary of MOIP, \nwhich will comprise representatives from the following organizations: \n \n(i)  MOIP; \n(ii)  Ministry of Commerce; \n(iii)  Ministry of Finance; \n(iv)  State Bank of Pakistan (SBP); \n(v)  Ministry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis (MOL); \n(vi)  Export Promotion Bureau; \n(vii)  provincial economic development departments; \n(viii)  chambers of commerce; \n(ix)  industry and trade associations; \n(x)  professional organizations; \n(xi)  financial institutions; and \n(xii)  private sector representatives of SMEs and/or SME organizations from each \nprovince. \n \n3.  The TF will determine its rules of business (and may determine that private sector \nrepresentatives will be nonvoting members). Other organizations and individuals can be invited \nto join the TF at the discretion of the TF. The TF may also invite written submissions from the \ngeneral public. MOIP has appointed SMEDA to maintain the secretariat functions for the TF \nincluding maintaining records of meetings, providing administrative support and, under the \nguidance of the TF, assisting in the preparation of drafts of the SME policy. \n \n4.  The purpose of the SME policy is to: \n \n(i)  develop a definition of SME, based on numbers of employees and/or annual \nturnover,  including  subdivisions  into  different  sizes  of  SMEs,  and  determine \n                                                 \n1  Costs and financing of the subproject are summarized in Appendix 7. Implementation arrangements of the \nsubproject are detailed in Appendix 8. \n ", "    Appendix 4  43 \nwhether and how the definition should vary for different purposes, such as \nregistration,  financial  assistance,  access  to  support  services,  and  industry \nspecifics ; \n(ii)  define the roles of different stakeholders in SME support, ni cluding national \nministries, provincial and local government departments, private sector SME and \nSME  organizations,  employer  and  worker  organizations,  academia,  and \nnongovernment  organizations;  and  adopt  a  least-intervention  government \napproach; \n(iii)  institutionalize  the  SME  support  system  to  ensure  regular  communication \nbetween  the  national,  provincial,  and  local  governments  and  the  target \nstakeholders  through  (a)  permanent  national  policy  committee,  (b)  regular \ncoordination  among  different  levels  of  government  and  different \nministries/departments, (c) regular monitoring and independent evaluation, (d) \ncontinuous absorption and integration of international experience to refine the \nsupport system, and (e) biannual report to Parliament on SME development; \n(iv)  communicate legislation and its purpose effectively through the dissemination of \npolicy, regulation and support services, and timeliness of translation of laws into \nappropriate regulations utilizing local language; \n(v)  identify and address major demand-side SME concerns including (a) business \nenvironment (regulation, inspection, annual fiscal policy changes, and region-\nspecific concerns), (b) competitiveness (including adequate human resources \nand access to premises), and (c) access to finance; and \n(vi)  expand support services through encouraging private sector providers, start-up \nassistance,  assistance  to  companies,  sole  proprietorships  and  partnerships, \ntechnology transfer, competitiveness research, and international trade. \n \n5.  Developing SME Policy. The TF will (i) draft an issues paper, (ii) draft the SME policy, \nand (iii) consult with key stakeholders including SMEs and SME organizations in each province \non each draft of the SME policy. \n \n6.  Development and Implementation of Action Plan. The TF will present a detailed \nprocess  and  time-bound  action  and  resource  plan  for  consultative  preparation  and \nimplementation of the SME policy to the minister of industries and production by 30 June 2004. \nThe TF will operate in accordance with the time-bound action plan. The TF will submit the final \nSME policy to the minister by June 2005. By December 2006, the Government will implement \nthe SME policy in accordance with the priorities set out in the time bound action and resource \nplan, including publication of the first annual SME report in Urdu. \n \n2.  The Assistance: Objectives and Scope \n \n7.  The Project will provide consulting services to SMEDA and the TF in developing the \nSME policy. The objective of the assistance is to support the TF in the timely development and \ndissemination of the SME policy through: \n \n(i)  advice to the TF and other stakeholders on international good practice; \n(ii)  support and facilitation of activities building stakeholder consensus; \n(iii)  collaboration with MOIP, TF, the core program management unit, and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  on  any  policy  or  implementation  issues  and \nrecommendation of specific remedies; \n(iv)  development of a consistent policy document and a focused action plan reflecting \npriorities of SME policy; and \n   ", "44  Appendix 4 \n(v)  assistance  to  organize  and  moderate  discussions  and  workshops  with \nstakeholders and sharing of relevant information with the public. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n \n8.  The  implementing  agency  will  be  SMEDA.  The  assistance  will  be  implemented \nintermittently over 36 months. An international SME policy specialist (1.5 months), and domestic \nSME specialists (11 months) will support the TF. SMEDA will provide office facilities for the \nconsultants. The consultants will have expertise in policy development and will be selected by \nthe implementing agency after concurrence by ADB on an individual basis in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants acceptable for ADB. Besides the terms of reference, the consultants will \nprepare quarterly progress reports and a final report at the end of the task.  \n \n9.  The consultants will provide the following services to the TF: \n \n(i)  assist private sector led policy advisory groups in identifying issues, solutions \nand priorities for action, and assist in preparing concise recommendations for \npolicy reform; \n(ii)  assist the TF in drafting an SME policy in a consultative process; \n(iii)  assist  the  Government  in  issuing  the  policy  and  preparing  and  action  and \nresource plan for its implementation;  \n(iv)  improve depth and accuracy of statistics to monitor SME policy impact, including: \n(a)  developing a plan to conduct an SME survey on annual basis; \n(b)  designing  a  database  for  an  SME  survey  and  recommending  the \nparameters that should be included in the database; \n(c)  designing an SME survey and choosing a firm to conduct the first or \nbaseline survey; \n(d)  designing a computer database to permit SME information to be retrieved \nwhen needed and for yearly statistics to be combined or analyzed; and \n(e)  developing a detailed plan for publishing and distributing the survey. \n \nB.  Component 1.2: Labor Protection and Inspection Policy Development \n \n1.  Background and Rationale \n \n10.  MOL has undertaken the mandate to prepare a labor protection policy (LPP) and labor \ninspection policy (LIP). The policies fall within a hierarchy of policies under which national \ndevelopment policies determine national labor policy. The national labor policy will determine \nthe LPP, which sets the framework for the LIP. The LPP and LIP will reflect the Government\u2019s \nobjective  of  promoting  business  opportunities,  enhancing  productivity,  and  improving \ncompetitiveness, and ensuring that workers are adequately protected and benefit from the \nnation\u2019s economic progress. \n \n11.  Task Force. To develop the LPP and LIP, MOL has established a TF chaired by a \nsenior  representative  of  MOL,  which  will  comprise  representatives  from  the  following \norganizations: \n \n(i)  MOL; \n(ii)  Ministry of Finance; \n(iii)  MOIP; \n ", "    Appendix 4  45 \n(iv)  Ministry of Commerce; \n(v)  Ministry of Social Welfare and Women\u2019s Development; \n(vi)  provincial labor departments; \n(vii)  Pakistan Employers\u2019 Federation; \n(viii)  Pakistan Federation of Trade Unions; \n(ix)  All Pakistan Federation of Labor; and \n(x)  Workers Employers Bilateral Council of Pakistan. \n \n12.  Other organizations and individuals can be invited to join the TF at the discretion of the \nchairperson and the TF itself. The TF may also invite written  submissions from the general \npublic. MOL will appoint a secretary and support staff to the TF, who will be responsible for \nmaintaining records of meetings, providing administrative support and, under the guidance of \nthe TF, assisting in the preparation of LPP and LIP drafts. \n \n13.  Developing LPP. The TF will draft a policy titled Labor Protection Policy 2004 and \nconsult with key stakeholders including representatives of employers and workers and provincial \nlabor departments on the draft, finalize the LPP, and submit the final LPP to the minister of labor \nby 31 March 2004. The purpose of the LPP is to ensure that workers\u2019 rights are protected, \nworking conditions are fair, and enterprise efficiency and competitiveness are encouraged. The \nobjectives of the LPP are to:  \n \n(i)  protect workers in all sectors engaged under various employment arrangements \nincluding (a) formal employment contracts, (b) self-employment, (c) agricultural \nand informal sector, (d) seasonal, and (e) home work; \n(ii)  contribute to labor productivity enhancement, and assist enterprises to become \nmore efficient and competitive; and \n(iii)  alert employers, workers, potential investors, and the international community \nthat  Pakistan  is  committed  to  improving  labor  protection  as  part  of  its \ndevelopment strategy. \n \n14.  Developing LIP. Draft a policy titled Labor Inspection Policy 2004 and consult with key \nstakeholders  including  representatives  of  employers  and  workers  and  provincial  labor \ndepartments on the draft, finalize the LIP based on consultations as required, and submit the \nfinal LIP to the minister of labor by 30 September 2004. \n \n15.  The purpose of the LIP is to ensure that appropriate institutional arrangements are in \nplace to effectively implement the LPP. The objectives of LIP are to: \n \n(i)  adopt an innovative approach to labor inspection that is flexible, transparent, and \nfair; \n(ii)  ensure that inspection also covers informal sector enterprises; \n(iii)  encourage the private sector to provide labor inspection services; \n(iv)  encourage enterprise compliance with labor policies and laws through means \nother than rigid law enforcement; and \n(v)  encourage increased harmony and dispute prevention in enterprises between \nworkers and managers. \n \n16.  Implementation of Action Plan. The TF will operate in accordance with a time-bound \naction plan drafted by MOL, to be endorsed by the TF. The work of the TF will be assisted by \ntwo policy outlines prepared by MOL to highlight key issues and give a focus to the TF\u2019s \ndeliberations without limiting the breadth and scope of discussions. The TF will strive for \n   ", "46  Appendix 4 \nconsensus on the policy issues. Where this proves to be impossible, different viewpoints will be \nrecorded and presented to the minister of labor for advice and, if necessary, final decision. The \nTF is concerned solely with policy matters and is not required to involve itself in legislation. \nOnce both the LPP and LIP have been finalized and endorsed by the Cabinet, the TF will \nconduct awareness raising for employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations on both policies at the \nprovincial level. \n \n2.  The Assistance: Objectives and Scope \n \n17.  ADB will provide assistance through consulting services to the MOL Central Labour \nAdvisory Unit and the Social Security Unit and the TF in developing the LPP and LIP. The \nobjective of the assistance is to support the TF in the timely development and dissemination of \nthe LPP and LIP, and will include the following areas: \n \n(i)  advice to the TF and other stakeholders on international good practice; \n(ii)  support and facilitation in building stakeholder consensus; \n(iii)  collaboration with MOL and TF, the core program management unit, and ADB on \nany policy or implementation issues and recommendation of specific remedies; \n(iv)  follow-up on the progress of the LPP and LIP policy measures; and \n(v)  assistance  to  organize  and  moderate  discussions  and  workshops  with \nstakeholders and sharing of relevant information with the public. \n \n3.  Consulting Services  \n \n18.  The implementing agency will be MOL. The component will be implemented over 24 \nmonths. An international labor policy specialist (6 months), and a full-time domestic labor \nspecialist (20 months) will support the TF in conducting its task. MOL will provide office facilities \nfor the consultants. In addition to the tasks specified under para. 17, the consultants will assist \nthe TF in preparing progress reports, and ADB missions. The consultants will be experienced \nlabor policy specialists and recruited on an individual basis consistent with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the use of domestic consultants satisfactory \nto ADB. Besides the terms of reference, the consultants will prepare quarterly progress reports \nand a final report at the end of the task.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 5  47 \nSUBPROJECT 2: SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE BUSINESS SUPPORT FUND1 \n \nA.  Background and Rationale \n \n1.  Business development services (BDS) are a key instrument to enhance competitiveness \nof small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Business development services are demand driven \nand include a large variety of services including business planning, production management, \nproduct  design,  quality  standards  and  control,  productivity  studies,  marketing, information \nsystems, and training. Currently, Pakistan lacks a BDS market for SMEs, with constraints on \nboth the supply and the demand side. On the supply side, BDS providers target the larger well-\nestablished enterprises, while on the demand side SMEs lack access to a wide range of \ncompetitively priced services targeted to their business needs. \n \n2.  International  experience  with  BDS  in  developing  markets  shows  that  two  basic \napproaches  have  been  followed:  (i)  creation  of  a  public  sector  service  provider;  and  (ii) \nfacilitation  of  a  demand-driven,  decentralized  market  for  private  sector  service  providers. \nExperience  illustrates  that  the  first  approach  has  not  succeeded  because  setting  up  one \ndominant or single service provider in the public sector places that entity in a privileged position, \nenabling it to undermine other market participants because of free or highly subsidized services; \nit is also supply driven, and thus particularly unresponsive to market preferences. Putting \ngovernment-facilitated programs for supporting BDS in the private sector is effective because \nthe market allocation process is more efficient in determining the demand. There should be a \nrange  of  different  providers,  providing  a  variety  of  different  services.  The  individual  SME \npurchaser of the services should be free to identify its particular BDS needs, select its service \nprovider(s), and negotiate the terms of the services provided. Building up an industry in BDS \nprovision strengthens this market allocation of demand and supply in SME development. One \ndesign of government facilitation of the private sector to meet SME development needs that has \nbeen particularly successful in recent years is the cost-sharing grant scheme. \n \n3.  The key features of cost- sharing grant schemes are: \n \n(i)  a fund is created and advertised widely to BDS users and providers; \n(ii)  SMEs prepare a plan showing how they intend to improve their competitiveness;  \n(iii)  SMEs will gain access to services provided by service providers through a grant, \nif the plan is supported by the managers of the cost-sharing grant facility; and \n(iv)  assistance is given to SMEs to prepare the plans. \n \n4.  The cost-sharing grant schemes work for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  the SME remains in control of the transaction, choosing what the plan will look \nlike, what services to buy and in what order, which service provider to buy the \nservices from, and whether the result is satisfactory and thus whether to pay; \n(ii)  there is free access to the facility on a first come first served basis for proposals \nof suitable quality; \n(iii)  a market is encouraged in BDS services. Only those service providers that have \ndelivered quality BDS services at competitive prices are likely to be selected by \nsubsequent  SMEs.  The  facility  disseminates  market  information  to  potential \nbuyers of services; \n                                                 \n1  Cost and financing of the subproject is summarized in Appendix 7. Implementation arrangements of the subproject \nare detailed in Appendix 8. \n   ", "48  Appendix 5 \n(iv)  the scheme is deliberately temporary, intending to jump-start the BDS market; \nand \n(v)  the  scheme  is  deliberately  partial  with  a  high  SME  contribution  in  order  to \npromote sustainability beyond the period of the scheme. \n \n5.  How Cost-Sharing Grant Schemes Have Worked in Other Countries. Recent studies \nhave  looked  at  10  cost-sharing  grant  schemes  in  Bangladesh,  India,  Indonesia,  Kenya, \nMauritius, Mexico, South Africa, and Uganda. The studies measured direct impact, in terms of \nadditional exports generated per dollar of cost-sharing grant support: 48 times within 5 years in \nIndia; 36 times within just 1 year in Indonesia; 30 times in just 1 year in Kenya; 160 times within \n1 year in Mauritius. The studies identified the following as key areas in the success of the \nschemes: grant size and payment arrangement, fund governance and management (including \noverheads), service provider quality control, realistic SME and subproject eligibility and simple \nprocedures, and adequate monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nB.  The Assistance: Objectives and Scope \n \n6.  The Project will establish a cost-sharing grant scheme, the SME Business Support Fund \nCompany, to facilitate SME development through a market-based BDS service provision, the \nBusiness Support Fund (BSF). To ensure direct access of SMEs to BDS, strong governance in \nselection and management of BSF-funded projects, and private sector support for the initiative, \nthe design of the BSF envisages its establishment through a Government endowment as a \nnonprofit company2 with the majority of the directors of the board representing the private \nsector, and an independent management unit led  by an experienced facility manager. The \nboard of directors will approve a business plan and standard operating procedures (SOP) for \nthe management of the BSF based on final drafts, which have been developed. \n \n7.  The BSF will  support an expected 1,500 subprojects, of which more than 95% are \nexpected not to exceed a cost-sharing grant value of $15,000. These projects are estimated to \nbenefit about 8,000 SMEs. The implementation plan, performance indicators and targets, and \ninstitutional setup for the facilities have been included in the business plan for the BSF. The \nSOP specify among others (i) eligibility criteria for SMEs and application process; (ii) rules to \navoid conflicts of interest and misuse of funds; and (iii) procedures for facility management \nincluding the appraisal of applications, disbursement procedures, program monitoring, and \nannual review of the performance of the BSF through the board of directors. \n \n8.  The Project will: \n \n(i)  support  the  establishment  of  the  BSF  as  a  nonprofit  company  with  a \nmanagement and governance structure reflecting international best practice in \ndeveloping markets through consulting services; \n(ii)  provide the funds for the cost-sharing grant facility; and \n(iii)  provide  operating  expenses,  including  costs  for  competitively  selected, \nexperienced, competent, professional management for the BSF including the \nfacility manager and permanent staff to be recruited by the BSF on proposal by \nthe facility manager. \n \n                                                 \n2  Under Section 42 of the Companies Act, 1984. Articles of association have been prepared. \n ", "    Appendix 5  49 \nC.  Consulting Services \n \n9.  The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Finance represented by the core program \nmanagement  unit.

Component 3.1:  Regulatory Policy Development, Credit Information, and \nCapacity Building for Financial Institutions  \n \n1.  Background \n \n1.  Recent Developments. Consistent with the reduction in the discount rate of the State \nBank of Pakistan (SBP), the average spread of the banks2 has decreased from 8.5% to 5.7% \nfrom July 2001 until June 2003, while average lending rates decreased from 14.5% to 7.6% in \nthat period. After a 2% increase during FY2002, credit to the private sector slightly declined by \n0.8% during the first 9 months of FY2003 to PRs1,056 billion ($18.3 billion). The largest total \nlending exposure of banks is to the textile industry (25%) followed by agribusiness (10%), while \nloans  to  trade  and  commercial  enterprises,  which  represent  about  50%  of  all  business \nestablishments, represented an extremely low total share of total lending exposure of 3%. \nDuring the first half of 2003, lending to large corporate clients increased by 7% and to consumer \nfinance by 17.3% (although from low levels), while lending to SMEs declined by 4.5%. \n \n2.  The small increase in lending since 2001 and the decrease during 2003 in a period of \neasing monetary policy and high liquidity in the market could partially be explained by the risk-\nadverse attitude of banks, and the rigidity in prudential regulations of SBP, especially with \nregard to lending limits and the restriction on banks not being permitted to lend based upon the \nborrowers\u2019 cash flows unless the loans are secured by well-documented assets (e.g., legal \ndocuments showing proof of ownership). Additionally, SBP and the private sector\u2019s credit \ninformation bureaus maintain incomplete coverage of loan exposures, which make it difficult for \nfinancial institutions (FIs) to obtain the necessary credit information for the smaller borrowers \nsuch as SMEs. Also, existing secured transactions law and the commercial court systems are \nineffective, thereby contributing to a market that is not conducive to lending to SME clients. By \nimproving credit information and making it possible to offer loans collateralized by movable \nassets, financing to SMEs, especially the smaller informal/nonregistered SMEs, could increase. \n \n3.  SME Finance Activities. SMEs, especially those in the informal sector with fewer than \n10 employees, are largely financed through the private savings of the owner, retained earnings \nof the enterprise, and/or family and friends. Access to finance from other sources is insignificant. \nAccording to a recent survey of approximately 1,000 SME3 manufacturers, only 1% of those \nsurveyed borrowed money from formal sources and such borrowings were mainly for working \ncapital purposes. Other sources of financing, such as trade credit, amounted to less than 5% of \nthose  surveyed.  The  SME  survey  confirms  that  utilization  of  credit  from  formal  financial \ninstitutions by manufacturers with fewer than 100 employees is only 7%. In general, the lending \npolicies of banks tend to favor the manufacturing sector, and since the majority of SMEs are \ntrade and service entrepreneurs, utilization of formal credit is insignificant for these enterprises.  \n \n4.  Information received from banks lending to SMEs indicates that borrowing of up to PRs5 \nmillion is far less significant and represents about 10,000 borrowers and less than 25% of the \ntotal loans outstanding. According to SBP, loans of up to PRs10 million only represented 0.1% \n                                                 \n1  Cost and financing of the subproject is summarized in Appendix 7. Implementation arrangements of the subproject \nare detailed in Appendix 8. \n2  Defined as the differential between average lending and deposit rates of the banking system. \n3  World Bank and SMEDA. 2003. Investment Climate Assessment of Pakistan. Unpublished. \n ", "    Appendix 6  51 \nof total lending of the banking system. While leasing companies are financing SMEs, their \noverall impact is marginal because of their small market share of total lending in the country.  \n \n5.  Credit Demand: Small SME Segment. A number  of surveys confirm that from an \nentrepreneur\u2019s  perspective,  lack  of  access  to  and  cost  of  bank  financing  are  significant \nimpediments to growth. While these factors do not determine actual market demand, less than \n5% of the estimated 230,000 SMEs (employing 5 or more staff) have access to formal credit. \n \n6.  Credit Demand: Medium and Large SME Segment. While the above sample survey \nindicates  far  better  access  to  credit  for  the  medium  SME  manufacturers,  about  13%  of \nmanufacturing SMEs (with more than 100 employees) reported access to financing for working \ncapital and 24% reported access to investment capital. There should be significant market \npotential for SMEs in the trade and service sectors as well as financing for working capital. This \nfact is underscored by SBP statistics, which report that loan amounts of up to PRs100 million \nrepresented less than 10% of banking system lending. The upper limit of the SME market, \nrepresenting exposures of between PRs100 million and PRs300 million, has an estimated 1,000 \nborrowers and appears to be better served. According to information received from banks, more \nthan two thirds of the banks\u2019 exposure to SMEs serves this segment of the market.  \n \n7.  Government Policies. As a result of the failure of the Government\u2019s program for \ndirected lending by development finance institution (DFIs) to the private sector, it adopted a \npolicy to gradually eliminate DFIs through privatization and/or liquidation. To encourage private \nsector lending, SBP and the Government have introduced appropriate regulatory and policy \nprocedures for banks to develop their own SME business strategies. In addition to its regulatory \nfunction, SBP publishes debtor information to help serve financial institutions (FIs) in their credit \nanalysis.  Currently,  SBP\u2019s  Credit  Information  Bureau  maintains  a  registry  of  loans  with  a \nminimum size of PRs 500,000, but does not aggregate the credit information by debtor. The \nCredit Information Bureau is planning to expand its registry to include loans with a minimum size \nof PRs200,000. Additionally, SBP is beginning to explore the possibilities of the private sector \nproviding such services to improve credit information for FIs. Secured financing is another \nmeans of enhancing access to credit for SME borrowers. Effective legislation would allow (i) \nborrowers to offer security interests in movable property, (ii) creditors to establish priority rights \nto  such  security  interests,  (iii)  enforcement  mechanisms  on  priority  rights,  and  (iv)  the \nestablishment of a registry for security interests. If secured financing were available, businesses \nother than FIs might also offer credit to suppliers and customers against secured collateral. \n \n2.  Objective and Scope \n \n8.  The objective of this project component is to increase SMEs\u2019 access to finance. The \ncomponent focuses on (i) developing a conducive regulatory and policy environment for SME \nfinance, (ii) encouraging private FIs to develop SME lending capability, and (iii) providing \ncapacity building to participating private FIs (PFIs) committed to operate SME finance units. \n \n9.  Developing a Conducive Regulatory and Policy Environment for SME Finance. In \norder to have a well-functioning financial system for SME lending, regulations, supervision, and \nmonitoring of the FIs must be improved and FIs\u2019 policies and procedures for SME lending must \nbe introduced. To improve FIs\u2019 ability in performing proper credit analysis on SMEs, more \ncomprehensive credit information must be provided to the FIs. Additionally, a feasibility study for \nimproving the existing framework for secured transactions will be prepared under a separate \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) funded grant. A banking regulation and supervision expert with \n   ", "52  Appendix 6 \nextensive experience in SMEs will be hired to assist in the review of SBP\u2019s regulations, and \nsupervision approach to the SME segment. \n \n10.  Encouraging FIs to Develop SME Lending Capability. Commercial SME finance is \nrelatively new in Pakistan. Capacity building on SME finance will be offered to both SBP and \nFIs. Seminars and workshops will be conducted by experts on the strategies and methods of \nestablishing  SME  finance  capability  at  the  FIs.  This  entails  market  research,  product \ndevelopment, lending processes, control systems, and capacity building of professional staff. \nAdvisory support will also be provided to assist FIs in developing SME business strategies.  \n \n11.  Customized Consulting Services to PFIs. FIs willing to establish an SME financing \nunit will be able to access consulting services by submitting a business plan for approval by \nSBP and ADB. Upon approval of the FI\u2019s business plan, the FI will be entitled to consulting \nservices on a cost-sharing basis to implement the business plan. \n \n12.  Consulting Services. Consultants to be financed under this subproject will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the \nengagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. The services require an innovative \napproach  to  awareness  building,  identification  of  PFIs,  and  PFI  senior  management \ncommitment  of  their  SME  finance  business  plans,  before  assistance  packages  can  be \ncustomized. Since there is no standardized approach for delivery of such services and the tasks \nof developing systems, lending processes, and procedures for SME finance are complex and \nrequire  highly  specialized  skills  and  a  significant  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  allocation  of \nexpertise, the quality-based selection method will be applied for the capacity-building portion of \nthis component (308 person-months of which 124 months are international and 184 months are \ndomestic expertise). Since the participating FIs will be identified in the awareness-building \nprocess through short-term consultants, the requisite terms of reference and specialized skills \nwill be customized to the needs of the individual PFI. It is expected that four PFIs will benefit \nfrom the capacity-building measures. The short-term positions (32 person-months of which 16 \nmonths are international and 16 months are domestic expertise) will be advertised and selected \non an individual basis. The experts will have a strong track record in emerging markets in the \nfollowing areas: (i) SME finance policy/regulation, (ii) awareness building and training, and (iii) \ndesign and implementation of downscaling programs for SME finance.  \n \nB.  Component 3.2: SME Bank Restructuring \n \n1.  Background and Rationale \n \n13.  On 1 January 2002, the Government merged two failed DFIs, the Regional Development \nFinance Corporation and the Small Business Finance Corporation, into SME Bank, a public \nlimited company. The Government owns directly and indirectly approximately 97% of the bank. \nSince its creation, SME Bank has experienced operational losses, primarily due to (i) substantial \nfixed costs (i.e., overstaffing and too many branches), and (ii) lack of appropriate credit analysis \nand risk management skills necessary to run and operate a bank specializing in SME lending. \nSince the Government believes it is vital for the development of the private sector in Pakistan \nthat SME Bank continues to provide term financing to SMEs, especially to the lower segment of \nthe SME market, the SME Bank has recently prepared a restructuring plan to improve its \nperformance. According to the restructuring plan, SME Bank\u2019s business will be reorganized into) \nan SME business unit, and a recovery unit. Additionally, the restructuring plan includes (i) a \ntime-bound action plan to reduce the number of bank branches and rationalize staff of the \nrecovery unit to a sustainable cost level; and (ii) an independent human resource audit to (a) \n ", "    Appendix 6  53 \nevaluate the skills of the employees at the bank, (b) identify and match such skills for specific \njobs within the bank, (c) identify alternative job opportunities for certain employees, and (d) \nprovide active job-search assistance and reemployment training for personnel. \n \n2.  Objective and Scope \n \n14.  This component will be implemented over 24 months and will assist the Government and \nSME Bank with the implementation of the restructuring plan, and provide expertise to (i) identify \nmarket niches for SME Bank, (ii) establish lending policies and procedures, (iii) develop financial \nproducts, (iv) develop marketing strategies to enhance outreach, and (v) develop sound risk \nmanagement  through  appropriate  incentives  for  staff,  controls,  and  sound  management \ninformation systems. SME Bank will recruit an individual international expert as head of its SME \nbusiness unit, who will lead for a 24-month period the buildup of the commercial SME business \nunit including the use of deposit and lending products for its clients. The expert will be selected \nin a competitive process by a committee composed of SME Bank and the core program \nmanagement  unit.  Recruitment  will  be  in  agreement  with  ADB  and  consistent  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The expert will prepare quarterly reports and a final \nreport at the end of the task. The expert will  have (i) at least 8 years experience in (a) \nestablishing  and  managing  SME  banking  for  commercial  FIs;  (b)  SME  credit  origination, \nmanagement,  and  risk  management;  and  (c)  analytical,  management,  marketing,  and \ninterpersonal skills; and (ii) the following responsibilities: \n \n(a)  prepare strategy and business plan to establish and manage the SME business, \n(b)  conduct market research surveys to identify business potential, \n(c)  develop a marketing plan to develop the image of SME Bank, \n(d)  based on the business plan develop products for SME finance, \n(e)  prepare a credit policy and risk management process for SME lending, \n(f)  establish credit administration and risk management systems, \n(g)  assist in the recruitment and staff development for the new business unit, \n(h)  train the bank\u2019s senior management and the board of directors, \n(i)  oversee the implementation of the capacity building/training program for staff, \n(j)  provide on the job assistance to officers, lending and loan recovery, and \n(k)  supervise SME business operations and performance. \n.\n   ", "54  Appendix 7 \nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The  mapping  of  the \nresponsibilities is illustrated in Figure A8. The technical assistance (TA) grant will provide for a \ndomestic full-time specialist housed at the Pakistan Resident Mission of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to support the coordination of the program. Details of the TA are in Appendix 10. \n \nB.  Key Program and Project Management Entities  \n4.  The following entities will ensure proper implementation of the Program: \n \n(i)  The steering committee (SC) \n(ii)  The  core  program  management  unit  (CPMU)  representing  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF) as the Executing Agency (EA); and \n(iii)  The  implementing  agencies  (IAs,  namely,  MOF,  Ministry  of  Industries  and \nProduction [MOIP], Ministry of Labour [MOL], State Bank of Pakistan [SBP], \nSMEDA, and SME Bank), as well as the BSF upon incorporation as a company. \n \n5.  Steering Committee. The SC will be chaired by the minister of finance and consist of \nthe secretaries of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Statistics; MOF; MOIP; MOL; and the \n ", "    Appendix 8  57 \ndeputy governor of SBP. The SC, supported by CPMU acting as its secretariat, will meet at \nleast on a semiannual basis and guide and oversee the implementation of program reforms and \nproject progress. \n \n6.  Private  Sector  Stakeholder  Review.  The  SC  will  establish  a  stakeholder  review \nprocess for ensuring adequate private sector feedback on the policy and project outputs. The \nprivate sector stakeholders will represent regional and SME sector interests including banking \nand finance, trade, service and manufacturing, professional and academic organizations, and \nSME business associations to be proposed by the EA. \n \n7.  Audit Review. The SC will establish an audit review process for ensuring adequate \nperformance review of the program and the project and addressing issues raised in financial \nand performance audits to be conducted by a firm associated with an internationally recognized \nauditing firm based on terms of reference and a shortlist agreed with ADB. The audit review \nprocess  will  include  members  representing  Government  and  professional  and  academic \norganizations to be proposed by the EA. Members of the stakeholder review and audit review \nprocesses will resign from their board membership or other advisory posts in IAs. The members \nwill  exercise  their  duties  on  a  nonprofit  basis  and  will  be  reimbursed  for  their  travel, \naccommodation, and food costs.  \n \n8.  Core Program Management Unit. MOF has appointed its joint secretary, banking to \ncoordinate the preparation of the Program and the Project among the government agencies and \nADB. Since the reform measures cover a number of line ministries and stakeholders and involve \nthe development of policies in a consultative manner, a permanent CPMU representing MOF as \nthe EA will be established prior to loan effectiveness to ensure that reforms are well managed, \nand  coordinated  and  communicated  among  government  agencies  and  private  sector \nstakeholders. In addition to its oversight and coordination functions, the CPMU will also act as \nthe IA for (i) the SME Bank restructuring component, (ii) the initial setup of the SME BSF, and \n(iii) the TA grant to support program coordination. MOF will establish the CPMU including the \nrequisite office infrastructure in Islamabad, recruit/assign staff, and provide adequate budgeting \nfor the CPMU and the SC. \n \n9.  CPMU Staffing.

Rationale and Objective \n1.  Rationale. As described in Sections II B5. and III E. in the main text, the development of \nmarket-based products to enhance the channeling of existing liquidity of the financial system to \nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a key innovation supported under the Small and \nMedium Enterprise Sector Development Program (SDP). \n \n2.  Objective: Increase SME Lending. The objective of the partial credit guarantee (PCG) \nfacility under the SDP is twofold: first, to leverage through a market-based approach existing \nfinancial resources of the financial system for lending to SMEs not currently served by financial \ninstitutions  (FIs);  second,  to  provide  catalytic  support  for  innovative  financial  products  and \napproaches in new markets. Once successfully tested with participating financial institutions \n(PFIs) at the initial stage, such products will be expanded among a larger number of FIs. The \nexpected outcome of the PCG facility is a higher volume of SME lending by commercial FIs.  \n \n3.  A Market-Based Alternative to Traditional Credit Lines. The PCG facility aims to \nprovide a market-based and more sustainable alternative to the traditional credit lines. Rather \nthan injecting additional liquidity into a market that is already highly liquid, the PCG facility aims \nto  channel  existing  sources  into  the  SME  sector  by  addressing  risk  allocation  concerns \nfundamental to the FI\u2019s lending decisions. Hence, the emphasis of the PCG facility will be on \nenhancing access to credit, not reducing prices, which will be market determined. The design of \nthe PCG facility also largely avoids issues that are related to currency mismatches that arise in \nthe case of credit lines in foreign exchange. \n \nB.  Facility Design \n1.  Structure \n \n4.  Identifiable Guarantee Contracts for Sharing of Risk and Rewards. Through the \nPCG facility, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will share with PFIs the credit risk of selected \nSME loans in return for a fee. Within the overall parameters of the PCG facility, ADB will issue \nspecific PCGs with agreed cover amounts and time frame to PFIs in Pakistan, which are \nselected following a due diligence process. The PCGs will detail the risk- and reward-sharing \narrangements for individual loans within a defined portfolio of loans extended by the PFIs to \nSMEs. The loan portfolio covered under each PCG may be of a revolving nature, and the \nportfolio composition may change over time based on lending decisions of the PFI within agreed \nparameters. ADB will not be involved in individual lending decisions by the PFIs, but will agree \nwith the PFIs the lending selection and risk management process. \n \n5.  A Public-Private Partnership Anchored in the SDP. The PCG is anchored in the SDP, \nwhich supports measures to ensure an enabling policy and institutional environment for SME \nlending. The PCG is an alternative approach to traditional credit lines in overcoming limited \naccess to credit encountered by SMEs. Hence, the integration of the PCG in the SME SDP \nmakes this a genuine public-private partnership, providing support to the private sector to take \nadvantage of the reforms supported by ADB\u2019s public sector operations. To underscore its \nmarket-based  approach,  the  PCG  facility  will  be  provided  through  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations without counterguarantee of the Government. Terms and conditions will be market \nbased. \n   ", "64  Appendix 9 \n2.  Scope \n \n6.  Fixed Facility Amount with Flexible Sublimits for PFIs. The PCG facility is proposed \nto have an overall limit of $65 million, which represents the maximum aggregate amount of all \nPCGs outstanding and ADB\u2019s maximum exposure under the PCG facility. The PCGs will be \nissued for each PFI based on demand and prudent practices, starting at PCG sublimits with \nlower amounts that can be gradually increased within the overall PCG facility limit. To avoid a \nhigh  concentration  of  risks  to  any  single  PFI,  sublimits  will  initially  be  set  at  $20  million \nequivalent for each PFI, but ceilings may be adjusted from time to time in line with actual \nutilization, loss experience, and soundness of the PFI. The total size of the PCG facility can be \nincreased at a later stage for a supplementary amount, based on experience and demand, \nsubject to a separate approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors at such time. \n \n7.  Comprehensive Risk Coverage.  The proposed PCG facility will, under each PCG \nissued, share the credit risk on both principal and interest payments for individual loans in a \nportfolio of eligible SME loans issued by each PFI, based on the lending decision by the PFI \nwithin defined risk parameters. The determination of the SME loan portfolio, and the PFI\u2019s \napproach to SME lending, are the crucial parameters that determine risk exposure, and will be \nspecified in the guarantee agreement with each PFI following a due diligence process.  \n \n8.  Risk Sharing with PFIs. Risk sharing with PFIs will take place on two levels, on an \nindividual loan basis. First, a first loss limit will be defined that will be fully absorbed by the PFI. \nThe first loss will be a function of the strength of the financial institution, its past SME lending \nhistory, and its risk management systems. The level of first loss may be fixed between 0% for \nstrong institutions with an established track record up to 30% for new market entrants. Second, \nany loss in excess of the first loss borne by the PFI will be at an agreed risk sharing percentage, \nnormally expected at 50% with the PFI.  \n \n9.  Prudent Phasing-in and Close Monitoring.  Since the PCG product is new both in \nPakistan and for ADB, the PCG facility will commence operation with commercial FIs that have \nwell-established  underwriting  procedures  of  international  standard  and  demonstrated \nexperience in applying similar lending methodologies elsewhere, before expanding to domestic \nFIs. Likewise, the portfolio of eligible loans will expand gradually. The tenor of guaranteed loans \nwill be limited to 36 months, although initially the PCG may be targeted at shorter maturities. A \nbigger share of SMEs in the middle market (with turnover between PRs100 million and PRs300 \nmillion) may be allowed, following a prudent approach. Once ADB is satisfied with the track \nrecord of the PFI and its SME borrowers, portfolio targets may be revised to encourage PFIs to \nexpand further to smaller SMEs and expand tenors.  \n \n10.  PCG Limits in US Dollars for Risks Denominated in Local Currency. Guarantee \nlimits with PFIs will be in US dollar terms, but PFIs are expected to extend loans to SMEs under \nthe PCG in local currency. Any risk as a result of currency fluctuations beyond the PCG limit for \neach PFI will be for the account of the PFI, since ADB\u2019s risk exposure will be capped with the \ndollar amount specified for each PFI under the guarantee agreement. \n \n11.  Facility Available Until End-2008. The availability of the facility is about 5 years from \nthe expected date of ADB approval, until 31 December 2008. During this period, PCGs can be \nissued by ADB and adjusted until the final facility date, which may be up to 31 December 2011.1 \nUpon expiration of the facility availability period on 31 December 2008, all outstanding loans \n                                                 \n1  If a 36-month loan was issued under a PCG on the last availability day of the facility, the exposure for ADB would \nbe until 31 December 2011. \n ", "    Appendix 9  65 \ncovered under the PCGs will remain covered until they fall due, but no new loans or renewals of \nexisting loans will be covered by the PCGs.  \n \n3.  Eligibility and Selection of Loans \n \n12.  Targeted SME Profile. Typical SMEs targeted under the facility would be suppliers and \nvendors of and to larger corporate clients of the PFIs, in nontraditional industries that have \nreasonably  established  and  integrated  supply  chain  structures  in  Pakistan,  such  as  the \npharmaceutical, automobile, engineering, and consumer goods industries. For example, large \ncorporate entities in the pharmaceutical industry provide their products to about 200 pharmacies \nin Karachi alone. Many of these pharmacies have an annual business turnover of about PRs50 \nmillion to PRs150 million, but currently face large constraints in accessing working capital. \nLarger  pharmacies,  wholesale  distributors,  and  hospitals  usually  do  not  have  difficulty  in \naccessing credit from FIs.  \n \n13.  Relationship Between PFIs and SMEs. It is envisaged that most SMEs included in the \nguaranteed loan portfolio will not have a borrowing relationship with the PFI prior to the PCG \nagreement. The relation between the PFI and the SME may be established either through (i) \nconfirmation of the PFI\u2019s corporate client that the SME is one of its suppliers, vendors, or \nestablished clients; or (ii) a guarantee of the corporate client on behalf of the SME. Existing \nSME clients of the PFI may also be included if this entails an increase in their credit limit. Direct \nrelationships of PFIs with SME clients are also encouraged within an agreed lending approach. \n \n14.  Eligibility of SMEs. PCGs issued to PFIs will be limited to coverage of loan portfolios \nwith the following borrower characteristics: \n \n(i)  SMEs with an annual business turnover of up to PRs300 million will be eligible to \nreceive loans covered by the PCG (in line with the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s SME \nregulations); \n(ii)  new SME borrowers are eligible, or additional credit limits to existing SMEs; \n(iii)  SMEs  must  have  2  years  minimum  period  of  profitable  operation,  and  no \nnegative credit history; \n(iv)  pricing of covered loans is market based; \n(v)  SME\u2019s operating in any business listed in a specified negative list will not be \neligible;2 \n(vi)  SMEs meet credit policies and procedures established by the PFI and acceptable \nto ADB; and  \n(vii)  SMEs maintain a good credit track record throughout the duration of the PCG. \n \n15.  Flexibility to Fine-Tune Targeting. SME characteristics may be revised based on \nactual experience and the eligibility thresholds under the facility may be adjusted by ADB, in \nconsultation with the PFIs, to better target smaller SMEs. \n \n4.  Eligibility and Selection of Participating Financial Institutions \n \n16.  All Private Sector and Financially Sound FIs in Pakistan. All licensed and financially \nsound FIs in Pakistan established in the private sector are eligible, in principle, for a PCG under \nthe facility. All PFIs will demonstrate in a business plan their intention to move from the existing \n                                                 \n2  In addition to the items listed in the negative list attached in Supplementary Appendix 1, SMEs involved in \nproduction processes, which are environmentally hazardous as defined in ADB\u2019s environment policy, are not \neligible for the PCG cover. It also excludes construction activities involving resettlement, and procurement from \nADB non-member countries.  \n   ", "66  Appendix 9 \ncustomers to smaller customers over time. This entails a starting point of SMEs with a business \nturnover of PRs 300 million and a gradual lowering of the business turnover and loan sizes for \nindividual customers. The review process will evaluate the PFIs\u2019 performance against the \nagreed targets. A due diligence process will be carried out by ADB for each potential FI, to \ndetermine  the  likely  outreach  of  the  PFIs  to  SMEs,  and  the  PFI\u2019s  financial  soundness, \nmanagement,  and  risk  management  quality.  Each  potential  PFI  must  demonstrate  sound \nmanagement track record in managing credit risk over the last 3 years, and uninterrupted \naccess to liquidity to finance the business. Capital at risk defined as past dues exceeding 90 \ndays may not exceed a certain percentage of the total outstanding portfolio, as defined in line \nwith prudent banking practice. Rescheduled loans will be reported separately.  \n \n17.  Due Diligence Process. The due diligence process will include (i) a review of the PFI\u2019s \nbusiness plans (demonstrating the gradual move down market to smaller customers), and \nidentification of the target SME portfolio and the expected uptake of loans; (ii) assessment of the \nPFI\u2019s soundness in underwriting loans and managing credit risk, especially in the targeted \nsegment;  (iii)  determination  of  lending  and  risk  parameters;  (iv)  analysis  of  the  PFI\u2019s \nenvironmental policy and its incorporation in the lending and risk management process; (v) \ndescription of the PFI staff\u2019s accountability for environmental concerns in the loan origination \nand  management  process;  (vi)  capability  of  the  management  and  staff  dealing  with \nenvironmental assessment (proposed remedies as necessary), determination of the first loss to \nbe borne by the PFI, and of a risk sharing rate for the credit risks beyond the first loss; and (vii) \ndescription of the monitoring, reporting, and semiannual review process on the utilization, \ncompliance  with  meeting  SME  lending  targets,  environmental  and  other  safeguards,  and \nimplementation arrangements of the PCG facility. In light of the above, the PCG amount for \neach PFI will initially be determined and will reviewed semiannually and adjusted as necessary. \n \n18.  Start with Established International FIs. ADB has to date (November 2003) developed \nthe detailed PCG product design and performed due diligence on the SME credit selection and \nrisk management processes of two international FIs operating in Pakistan, namely Citibank and \nStandard Chartered Bank. ADB found them to be financially sound, with well-established credit \nmanagement systems, although they adopted different approaches to SME lending. Once initial \nexperience has been gained, domestic FIs are expected to follow. This process must be gradual \nand  driven  by  demand,  since  supply-induced  efforts  to  increase  outreach  have  proven \nunsustainable. Under the SME SDP, domestic FIs will have access to support in upgrading their \nbusiness processes and products to serve SMEs. It is expected that successful completion of \nthe capacity building will help identify domestic FIs that may qualify as PFIs under the facility. \n \n5.  Pricing \n \n19.  Market-Based Profit Sharing. The PFI will pay to ADB a predetermined fee either as a \nfixed rate based on the PFIs profit in lending to SMEs in the agreed portfolio and reviewed \nsemiannually, or as a variable rate reflecting the PFIs profit as documented in the PFIs financial \nstatements. The fee will be market based and determined for each PFI based on the risks \nidentified during the due diligence process and the risk sharing mechanism agreed between \nADB and the PFI, as approved by ADB\u2019s Guarantee Committee chaired by the Office of \nCofinancing Operations. In accordance with market practice front-end fees will not be charged \nto the PFIs. \n \nC.  Implementation and Monitoring of the Partial Credit Guarantee Facility  \n \n20.  Legally Binding Guarantee Agreement. ADB will enter into a PCG agreement with \neach PFI, which governs all aspects of the PCG. This will define the portfolio loans to be \n ", "    Appendix 9  67 \ncovered (including the PFI\u2019s SME target benchmarks in terms of SME outreach, such business \nturnover, number of loans, loan tenors, and credit volume), scope of cover and determination of \nloss,  loss  and  revenue-sharing  rates  on  the  defined  loan  portfolio,  claims  and  recovery \nprocedures, as well as other relevant aspects. \n \n21.  Standardized PCG Contracts with Customized Terms and Conditions. Guarantee \nagreements with PFIs will follow a standardized format and outline. However, because each \npotential PFI differs in the (i) approach to access the SME market and (ii) quality of the lending \nprocess, the conditions of the PCG will be determined on a case-by-case basis based on the \ndue diligence of the FI and its SME lending processes and operations. Terms and conditions for \neach PCG will be detailed in a term sheet in line with the parameters described in this RRP, \nsubject to review by ADB\u2019s Guarantee Committee and procedures detailed in a Guarantee \nAdministration Memorandum (GAM) prior to its finalization. \n \n22.  Performance Reviews and Monitoring. Each guarantee agreement will detail the \nrequirement for quarterly performance reporting and as well as prompt information on any \npotential losses or defaults in the portfolio. ADB will monitor the utilization of the PCG facility \nincluding its developmental and environmental impacts through semiannual on-site review of the \nPFIs exposure to SMEs, especially the portfolio quality underwritten by the PFIs and the PFIs\u2019 \nmeeting of agreed business targets of providing credit to additional lower segments of SMEs as \nreflected in the agreed business plans. Based on the semiannual reviews, ADB has the option \nto modify existing guarantee parameters, with adequate notice, or suspend new SME loan \ninclusions under the guaranteed portfolio. \n \n23.  Guarantee Administration Memorandum. A GAM will be prepared by the South Asia \nDepartment.  The  GAM  will  set  out  the  respective  responsibilities  of  ADB  departments \nconcerned (Office of Cofinancing Operations; Office of the General Counsel; Regional and \nSustainable Development Department; Pakistan Resident Mission; Private Sector Operations \nDepartment; and Governance, Finance and Trade Division, South Asia Department) in the \nselection of PFIs and management of the facility, including developmental and commercial \naspects, and the establishment of an environment management system as prescribed in ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy. Reporting requirements and information to be provided by the PFIs will also \nbe detailed in the PCG agreements. \n \nD.  Loss Determination, Claims Payment, and Loss Adjustment \n24.  Loss Determination. Risks guaranteed under each PCG are losses, in accordance with \nthe agreed loss-sharing ratios, that result from irrecoverable principal and interest payment \ndefault on SME loans included in the guaranteed loan portfolio. Losses are determined by the \nPFI in a transparent  manner, which will include appropriate documentation that there is a \nnonpayment of an amount due under a loan included in the guaranteed SME portfolio, and such \nnonpayment continues for a period to be determined individually for each PFI, net of any \nrecoveries that may have been realized since initial loss identification or provisioning. To \nsubstantiate a claim, the PFI has to demonstrate: \n \n(i)  substantial recovery efforts as soon as the loan is classified below \u201cnormal\u201d, \nincluding acceleration of repayments and collection from guarantors, if any, and  \n(ii)  that the PFI has met and continues to meet its obligations under the PCG \nthrough: \n(a)  immediate notification of ADB at the end of the month, when the loan is \nclassified below \u201cnormal\u201d; \n   ", "68  Appendix 9 \n(b)  submission of monthly reports on the whole relationship account with the \nborrower, advising ADB on the collection and provisioning status and \nrecovery efforts;  \n(c)  restructuring of loans to ensure repayment of the principal and interest; \nand \n(d)  initiating legal proceedings for liquidation of collateral and securities held \nto offset interest and principal. \n \n25.  Claims Payment. ADB will reimburse the PFI for the guaranteed percentage of losses \narising from guaranteed risks in excess of the first loss, after the receipt of a valid claim \nproviding satisfactory evidence of the PFI\u2019s right to compensation in the amount claimed net of \nlegal expenses. Claims will be paid in the currency in which the loss has arisen, subject to the \nUS dollar limit of the PCG for that PFI, based on an agreed reference rate of exchange.  \n \n26.  Loss  Adjustments.  If  the  PFI  recovers  any  credit  loss  after  having  received  a \nguaranteed payment from ADB under the PCG, that recovered amount will be applied to the \ncredit loss amount on a pro rata basis between ADB and the PFI, net of agreed external \nrecovery expenses, for reimbursement to ADB.  \n \nE.  Compliance with ADB Safeguard Policies: Environment, Resettlement, and \nIndigenous Peoples  \n27.  Safeguard Policies.  The PCG facility is classified as \u201cFinancial Intermediary\u201d for the \npurpose  of  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies.  ADB  will  establish  an  environment \nmanagement system, which will be detailed in the GAM and specified for each PFI under the \nguarantee agreement to ensure PFIs\u2019 adherence to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) as well as to ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. The GAM will also require PFIs under the guarantee \nagreements to acknowledge in progress reports that all borrowers comply with health, safety, \nand  environmental  regulations  and  standards  as  well  as  public  consultation  requirements \napplicable in Pakistan. Since the PFIs\u2019 loans to SMEs will be largely in the trade and light-\nmanufacturing sector, it is unlikely that involuntary resettlement or detrimental impacts on \nindigenous  peoples  will  occur.  As  for  environmental  safeguards,  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  will \nidentify areas for remedy, including negative lists and training as necessary. \n \n ", "    Appendix 10  69 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT FOR SUPPORTING COORDINATION OF THE SMALL \nAND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \n1.  Rationale. The policy reforms under the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Sector \nDevelopment Program (SDP) will be developed and implemented in close consultation with \nstakeholders  in  the  private  sector,  a  number  of  government  agencies,  nongovernment \norganizations, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). To effectively implement the reform \nagenda supported by the SME SDP, strong coordination mechanisms need to be established. \ntechnical assistance (TA) will be required to engage a domestic consultant to coordinate on a \nfull-time basis the reform efforts and maintaining momentum as a focal point between the above \nstakeholders to support the timely preparation and implementation of all SDP-related activities \nand to foster participation of and coordination among stakeholders through discussions and \nworkshops. \n \n2.
