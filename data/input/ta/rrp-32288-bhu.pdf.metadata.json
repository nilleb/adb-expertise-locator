Because the project road is the only east-\nwest link, the country will benefit from accessibility of improved\ntransport, savings in road maintenance costs, and reduction in\nvehicle operating costs (VOCs).\nClassification Primary objective: Economic growth\nSecondary objective: Poverty reduction\nEnvironmental  Category B\nAssessment\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken  and  the\nsummary is a core appendix.\nRationale The social and economic well-being of Bhutan is related to an\neffective  and  sustainable  road  transport  network  as  no  other\nmodes of transport are available for the movement of people and\ngoods.  The  extreme  geographic  conditions  and  mountainous\nterrain pose challenges to the provision of transport links and to its\nnecessary maintenance. The existing national road network is in\nneed  of  improvement  and  protection  as  the  deteriorated  road\nsurface  makes  journeys  longer  and  more  difficult.  Frequent\nlandslides  also  block  the  roads  and  cause  major  delays  in\nmovement by vehicle or on foot. Heavy snow cover in winter also\nhinders movement. The East-West Highway, the project road, is\noccasionally blocked by landslides, sometimes for more than a\nweek  at  a  time.  Constructed  to  a  single-lane  standard  by  the\nIndian Border Roads Organization during 1965-1985, the highway\nconnects Thimphu in the west to Trashigang in the east. The road\nis of strategic importance to Bhutan since it is the only means of\ntransport between the two important cities. The highway also links\na  number  of  other  urban  centers  along  the  route,  including\nWangdue-Phodrang, Trongsa, Jakar, and Mongar, and acts as the\nonly collector of traffic from the urban centers north and south of\nthe route.\nThe  Project  will  address  the  following  aspects  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) sector strategy and policy dialogue: (i)\nintegrate  the  domestic  market;  (ii)  enhance  access  to  local,\nregional,  and  international  markets;  (iii)  increase  employment\nopportunities and incomes, especially in rural areas, to reduce\npoverty; (iv) stimulate private sector activity, especially in rural\nareas;  (v)  develop  public/private  partnerships  for  planning,\nmanaging, and implementing construction and maintenance of the\nnational road network; (vi) improve road safety; and (vii) develop\nthe  domestic  consulting  profession.  The  Road  Planning  and", "iii\nManagement  Strengthening  Project  technical  assistance  (TA),\nwhich  will  be  implemented  concurrently  with  the  Project,  will\nimprove governance by strengthening the Department of Roads\n(DOR).\nObjectives and Scope The objectives of the Project are to (i) promote private sector\nparticipation and assist in developing the domestic contracting and\nconsulting  industries  by  introducing  a  pilot  contractor  and\nequipment  leasing  scheme;  (ii)  reduce  poverty  by  enhancing\nemployment opportunities for the poor and improving access to\nhealth,  education,  and  other  social  services;  and  (iii)  improve\ngovernance by providing institutional support to DOR. The Project\nwill undertake improvements on the East-West Highway, including\nresurfacing, construction of line drainage, and slope protection\nworks.  Because the project road is the only east-west link, the\ncountry will benefit from improved transport accessibility, savings\nin road maintenance costs, and reduction in VOCs. The Project\u2019s\nobjectives are consistent with the Government\u2019s priorities for road\nsector development under the Eighth Five-Year Plan (FY1997-\nFY2002).\nThe  Project  will  consist  of  the  following  components:  (i)\nresurfacing  of  about  380  kilometers  (km)  on  the  East-West\nHighway,  using  mechanized  techniques  in  an  environmentally\nsound manner and incorporating all related drainage works; (ii)\nimproving slope stability to preserve the existing national highway\nnetwork;  (iii)  implementing  a  pilot  contractor  and  equipment\nleasing  scheme  for  domestic  contractors  to  participate  in  the\nProject;  and  (iv)  providing  consulting  services  for  design  and\nsupervision of civil works and for institutional support.\nCost Estimates The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $12.8  million\nequivalent. The foreign exchange cost is $8.7 million and the local\ncurrency cost is $4.1 million equivalent, or 32 percent of the total\nproject cost.\nFinancing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB 8.7 0.9 9.6 75\nGovernment 0.0 3.2 3.2 25\nTotal 8.7 4.1 12.8 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank.", "iv\nLoan Amount and\nTerms  The  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  SDR7,310,000  ($9.6\nmillion equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a\nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and interest\ncharge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2005\nExecuting Agency Department of Roads\nImplementation\nArrangements The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  a  separate  project\nmanagement office within DOR.\nProcurement All civil works contract packages will be procured following local\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  among  prequalified  contractors\naccording to the Government\u2019s standard procurement procedures\nacceptable to ADB.

Road\nimprovement works under the Project will require mostly unskilled\nlabor  and  will  generate  direct  income-earning  opportunities,\nparticularly for the poor and women.\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately  60,000  people.\nAlthough a poverty line for Bhutan is yet to be established, the\nfeasibility report that gives the poverty profile of the population\naffected by the Project shows that more than one third of the\nProject\u2019s  beneficiaries  are  estimated  to  fall  below  the  poverty\nlevel. The beneficiaries will be (i) the poor who will achieve more\nmobility  in  seeking  employment  and  income-generating\nopportunities; (ii) entrepreneurs and petty traders who will be able", "v\nto set up enterprises along the road; (iii) agricultural enterprises\nthat will benefit from faster, cheaper, and reliable access to large\nmarkets and export opportunities; (iv) neighboring countries that\ncan utilize the route for improved access to Thimphu, thereby\npromoting regional cooperation; (v) passenger traffic along the\nThimpu - Wangdue-Phodrang \u2013 Bumthang \u2013 Mongar - Trashigang\nroutes,  and  (vi)  exporters  and  importers  who  will  benefit  from\nreduced transportation cost for freight using the shorter project\nroute.\nImproving the road conditions on the East-West Highway will also\nproduce road user benefits, such as savings in VOCs and time.\nFor the analysis, road user benefits were restricted to savings in\nVOCs arising from changes in surface roughness. Additionally,\nsince transport costs are relatively high and improvements offer\nsignificant  transport  cost  savings  that  will  stimulate  the  local\neconomy, there will also be an increase in the quantity and quality\nof  agricultural  production  in  the  project  area,  tourism,  and\nindustrial development. The Project is expected to have a positive\nsocial impact. The documented stakeholder consultations confirm\nwidespread support for the Project.", "vi", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Road Improvement Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The social and economic well-being of Bhutan is related to an effective and sustainable\nroad transport network as there are no other modes of transport available for the movement of\npeople  and  goods.  The  extreme  geographic  conditions  and  mountainous  terrain  pose\nchallenges  to  the  provision  of  transport  links  and  to  its  necessary  maintenance.  As  the\nGovernment  has  invested  in  the  steady  development  of  the  road  network  and  gradually\nassumed responsibility for its maintenance, the network has remained serviceable but requires\nsignificant investment in periodic and routine maintenance. To enhance the contribution of the\nroad network to the social and economic development in the country, during the 1997 Country\nProgramming Mission to Bhutan, the Government requested Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nfinancing for the Road Improvement Project. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission1 visited Bhutan on\n8-23 March 2000 to formulate the Project on the basis of discussions with the Government,\nother agencies active in the road sector, beneficiaries, and the project feasibility report.2 The\nAppraisal Mission completed the review and analysis of all aspects of the Project and the sector\non 21 May-1 June 2000. Loan negotiations with representatives of the Government were held in\nManila on 11-14 August 2000. The project framework is shown in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\n3. Bhutan experienced modest growth in output in fiscal year (FY) 1999, with real gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth estimated at 6 percent compared with 5.1 percent per annum\nthe previous year. Agricultural growth picked up after a slowdown the year before. Currently,\nmajor  hydropower  and  industrial  projects  have  continued  to  expand  construction  activities.\nHigher  industrial  growth,  particularly  in  electricity,  is  expected  after  the  projects  are\ncommissioned. Because of the exchange rate peg with the Indian rupee and the porous border\nwith India, prices in Bhutan can be expected to parallel price development in India. The pegging\narrangement has promoted confidence in the ngultrum along with the free circulation of Indian\nrupees in the country. This arrangement has also facilitated stability in the trade of goods and\nservices with India, which amounts to almost 80 percent of total trade. Inflation in FY1999\nincreased slightly beyond 9 percent from the previous year due to the rises in food prices in\nIndia. Money supply growth slowed from the highest of more than 40 percent in FY1998 to 21\npercent in FY1999. This represents a slower increase of net foreign assets from inflows of\nforeign aid and continued decline in domestic credit, particularly to the Government, although\ncredit to the private sector slightly increased.\n4. The Government continues to conduct a prudent fiscal policy, with current revenues\nexceeding current expenditures for the past four years. Inflows of foreign grants were not\nsufficient to cover development expenditures, and an overall budget deficit of 2.3 percent of\nGDP  occurred  in  FY1999,  compared  with  0.9  percent  surplus  in  the  previous  year.  This\napparent deterioration in the country\u2019s fiscal resources was due mainly to a major increase in\ncapital expenditures for the hydropower projects. As these investments are all financed by aid\n                                                \n1  The project processing team comprised M. Minc, Project Economist/Mission Leader; R. Rinker, Project Engineer;\nS. Handayani, Social Development Specialist; and S. Nanwani, Senior Counsel.\n2  TA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.", "2\nfunds  in  concessional  terms,  the  small  fiscal  deficit  represents  no  major  risks  to  the\nmacroeconomic imbalance in the medium term before these projects are commissioned.\nA. The Road Sector\n5. From a very few kilometers (km) in the 1950s, Bhutan\u2019s road network today has grown to\n3,375 km of national highways, which make up 47 percent of the total network (1,586 km).\nDuring Bhutan\u2019s first three development plans (FY1962-FY1976), three north-south roads from\nthe Indian border to the interior of the country were built. An east-west artery from Thimphu to\nTrashigang was also begun during that period and completed in 1985. The construction of\ndistrict and feeder roads began during the Fourth Plan and has continued until present times.\nThe Seventh Five-Year Plan (FY1991-FY1996) and the current Eighth Five-Year Plan (FY1997-\nFY2002, however, emphasized upgrading and maintenance of existing road assets rather than\nthe construction of new ones. The continued development of the road network has been driven\nby economic development priorities and by a steady growth in Bhutan\u2019s vehicle fleet and traffic\nvolume. From 700 vehicles in 1980, the fleet has grown to 18,288, of which 43 percent are two-\nwheelers, 41 percent are classified as light vehicles, and 16 percent are heavy vehicles. Traffic\nlevels are highest in the west and much lower in the east and the south. In relative terms, traffic\nlevels in Bhutan remain low. Basic data for the road sector is presented in Appendix 2.\n6. In the past 30 years, the Indian Border Roads Organization (IBRO) has undertaken the\nvast majority of the construction and maintenance works on Bhutan\u2019s road network through the\nDANTAK project.3 Over the last decade, however, responsibility for the national road network\nhas gradually shifted to the Royal Government of Bhutan. Now, IBRO still maintains 478 km of\nthe  national  highway  system.  It  is  expected  that  the  Government  will  eventually  assume\nresponsibility for those sections as well. The Government agency responsible for maintaining\nand managing the national road network is the Department of Roads (DOR) of the Ministry of\nCommunications (MOC), originally created as the Public Works Division. As the Government\ninvested  in  the  steady  development  of  the  national  road  network  and  gradually  assumed\nresponsibility for its maintenance, the network has remained serviceable but requires significant\ninvestment in periodic and routine maintenance.\n1. Road Transport Industry\n7. Three  bus  operators\u2013  Bhutan  Post,  Dawa  Transport,  and  Leksol  Buses\u2013currently\noperate passenger services along the East-West Highway. Passenger bus fares are regulated\nby MOC through the Road Safety and Transport Authority and reviewed quarterly. The average\nfares these operators charge for a selection of routes tend to be in the range Nu0.35-0.55 per\nkm. For trucks, average freight rates are not regulated and depend on the type of cargo, size,\nand ownership of the operator, availability of back-haul rates, and time of year. Freight rates are\ngenerally higher in the monsoon period, partly due to increased demand coinciding with the\nharvest season for many crops and partly due to the increased likelihood of trucks being\ndelayed due to landslides. Information collected from operators from a number of origins and\ndestinations in Bhutan indicates that, assuming an average payload of 8 tons, the average\nfreight rate is Nu2.5-3.5 per ton-km.\n                                                \n3  DANTAK is the IBRO project that constructed the national highways in Bhutan.", "3\n2. Planning and Administration\n8. The planning process in Bhutan begins with the development of the five-year plan. The\nPlanning Commission is responsible for developing the plan. The Policy and Planning Division\nof MOC prepares a national plan for the transport and human settlement sector in accordance\nwith planning guidelines set forth in the five-year plan. This plan also has a five-year horizon,\nproviding orientation to each of the operating units of MOC for the development of its annual\noperating plan. DOR has six operating entities: (i) Roads Division, (ii) Survey and Design\nDivision, (iii) Bridge Division, (iv) Mechanical Division, (v) Stores Unit, and (vi) World Food\nProgram Coordination. The annual investment plan for the Roads Maintenance Sections is\ndeveloped at the headquarters level from plans for each section submitted by the executive\nengineers. The investment plan includes proposed capital investments in road construction and\nperiodic maintenance, and emergency works such as slope protection or repair of damaged\npavement.\n3. Budgeting Process\n9. Annual budgets for road maintenance include two components, the investment budget\nand the routine maintenance budget. The investment budget is prepared by estimating the cost\nof the annual investment plan. The cost of patching potholes, especially when required prior to\nperiodic  maintenance  interventions,  is  included  in  the  investment  budget.  The  proposed\nimprovements in the annual investment plan are prioritized at an annual meeting organized by\nDOR headquarters, chaired by the director of roads and attended by senior staff representing\nthe  roads  maintenance  sections.  The  projects  selected  are  based  on  expected  budgetary\nallocations and on mutual agreement between the parties. Routine maintenance budgets are\nallocated on the basis of the number of kilometers in each maintenance section. In FY1999 the\namounts allocated and spent were Nu30,000 ($698) per km for national highways, Nu26,266\n($611) per km for district roads, and Nu11,800 ($274) per km for feeder roads.\n10. The proposed budget is submitted to the Department of Budget and Accounts of the\nMinistry of Finance where, after consideration of expected revenue and budgetary requirements\nfor all other Government agencies, a budgetary allocation is made to DOR. Due to budgetary\nconstraints,  the  allocation  is  generally  less  than  the  initial  request.  When  this  happens,\nallocations for routine maintenance are not reduced; rather, the investment plan is adjusted by\nremoving  projects.  During  the  year,  DOR  generally  requests  supplementary  budgetary\nallocations to meet emergency needs or to fund priority road improvements. If the request is\napproved and supplementary funds are available, the Ministry of Finance may provide them.\n4. Budget Allocations\n11. Road sector budgetary allocations have increased by an average of 23 percent per\nannum between FY1993 and FY1999. Funds allocated for resurfacing works increased by an\naverage of 57 percent per annum over the period, while maintenance expenditure increased by\nonly 12 percent per annum. Future plans for road sector expenditure as laid out in the Eighth\nFive-Year Plan for Bhutan allocates about Nu3.0 billion to the roads sector over the five-year\nplanning period. This represents a significant increase in the level of funding to the sector and\nconfirms the overall government objective to concentrate expenditure on social sectors including\nhealth and education, and transport.", "4\n5. User Charges and Expenditures\n12. The Government levies a range of user taxes and fees on the road transport sector.  The\nmain taxes are the fuel sales tax, motor vehicle taxes, retail sales taxes of vehicle components,\nimport duties, and weighbridge fees. The total revenues collected have increased sharply in\nrecent years, mainly the result of increased revenue from the sales tax on petroleum products.\nExpenditures have far outweighed the revenues collected within the sector. In FY1998, road\nsector revenues accounted for only 25 percent of total government expenditure on road sector\nactivities. However, there is clearly potential for increasing the revenues collected from road\nusers.  Appropriate  cost  recovery  mechanisms  for  Bhutan  will  be  assessed  during  the\nimplementation  of  the  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)4  for  the  Road  Planning  and\nManagement Strengthening Project.\n6. Regulatory Framework\n13. Over the years, the Government has addressed important legal issues affecting the road\nsector and transport industry through the various acts, rules, regulations, and guidelines issued\nby various government agencies: (i) the Rules and Regulations for construction of temporary,\nsemipermanent, and permanent houses on either side of a road issued by the Ministry of Home\nAffairs in 1993; (ii) the Road Safety and Transport Act 1999 issued by MOC; (iii) the Field\nManual of Road Maintenance issued by DOR in 1989; (iv) the bioengineering techniques for\nslope  protection  and  stabilization  issued  by  DOR  in  1999;  (v)  the  Environmental  Code  of\nPractices for Highways and Roads issued by DOR in September 1999; (vi) the Municipal Act of\n1999  issued  by  MOC;  (vii)  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Management  Act  1995  issued  by  the\nDepartment of Geology; (viii) the Land Act (second edition 1998) issued by the Ministry of Home\nAffairs; and (ix) the environmental guidelines on roads and highways issued by the National\nEnvironment Commission in 1999.\n14. A  review  of  the  many  interrelated  legislation  reveals  no  coordinated  and  focused\napproach through a single piece of legislation covering roads and road transport in the country.\nAlso, the agencies responsible for particular sectors are primarily concerned with safeguarding\ntheir respective interests, resulting in conflicting rules and regulations. Further, the enforcement\nmechanisms  are  varied  and  uncoordinated.  The  Government  recognizes  that  coordinated\nlegislation is needed, as the national road network is the predominant means of transport within\nthe country and as the number of road users and vehicles is increasing. Also, there needs to be\na clear delineation of authority and responsibility for enforcement.\n7. Proposed Road Act\n15. The Government has expressed its concern about the need for coordinated legislation to\ncover roads and road transport in the country. The TA will take into account the existing\nlegislation on road-related matters, and prepare draft legislation for the proposed Road Act,\ntaking  into  account  the  views  of  the  Government,  local  communities,  nongovernment\norganizations, and other stakeholders, including road users (vehicle owners, users of public\ntransportation, and freight transport users). The proposed draft legislation will (i) clearly define\nthe  responsibilities  and  rights  of  the  provider  (the  Government),  road  users,  and  affected\ncommunities; (ii) address the construction, rehabilitation, maintenance, and use of the road,\nwhile  safeguarding  or  mitigating  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  on  users  and  the\ncommunity at large; (iii) spell out the compensation to be paid in the acquisition of land,\n                                                \n4  TA 3470-BHU: Road Planning and Management Strengthening Project, for $954,000, approved on 20 July 2000.", "5\nincluding  right-of-way,  for  road  construction  in  accordance  with  existing  legislation;  (iv)\ndetermine the feasibility of levying user charges to recover the cost of maintaining the national\nroad network; (v) specify the agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing the provisions of\nthe legislation; and (vi) prescribe the penalties for any statutory violation. The Government will\nuse the draft legislation prepared under the TA as a basis for enacting the Road Act. Within\nthree years after loan effectiveness, the Government will (i) consult with ADB on any major\nchanges made to the draft Road Act before presenting it to the Cabinet and the National\nAssembly; and (ii) enact and make effective the proposed Road Act.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n16. In its five-year plans, the Government has given priority to investments in essential\ninfrastructure, providing better access to basic services, improving the quality of life in the rural\nareas,  supporting  community  participation  in  development  activities,  and  promoting  private\nsector involvement in project implementation. The main objectives of the current Eighth Five-\nYear  Plan  are  to  develop  a  regionally  balanced  network  that  is  safe,  convenient,  and\neconomical to use; preserve the past capital investment in roads; reduce the cost of vehicle\noperation  and  travel  time  of  road  users;  and  develop  road  construction  and  maintenance\ncapabilities in the private sector. The main strategies include (i) developing guidelines and\npractices for road design, construction, and maintenance that cause minimum adverse impact\non  the  environment;  (ii)  promoting  larger  private  sector  role  in  road  construction  and\nmaintenance through contracting; (iii) developing a long-term comprehensive road master plan;\n(iv) developing a suitable road maintenance management system; (v) improving maintenance\nsystems for rural roads; (vi) improving geometric features of roads to reduce accidents; (vii)\ntimely  resurfacing  of  existing  roads  to  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs);  (viii)\nstrengthening institutional capacity through further training; and (ix) utilizing locally available\nmaterials and resources whenever possible.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n17. The main source of external financing for roads in Bhutan has been the Government of\nIndia. Since 1959, India has provided assistance through the DANTAK for the construction and\nmaintenance of the main road network in Bhutan. The United Nations Capital Development\nFund has completed three projects for rural road development in the eastern region. The\nGovernment of Japan is supporting a bridge replacement program mainly along the East-West\nHighway. Helvetas of Switzerland is providing assistance to replace one bridge, also along the\nEast-West Highway. The World Bank recently approved the Rural Access Project for $11.6\nmillion for the construction of feeder roads in Zhemgang, Lhuentse, and Trashi Yangtse, and\nTrashigang Dzongkhag.5 It is important to note that all external interventions in the sector are\ncomplementary and rely on each other for justification of the overall investments. Details of the\nexternal assistance to the road sector are in Appendix 3.\n18. ADB has been providing support to the road sector in Bhutan since 1983. It began with\nthe Multiproject6 that focused on infrastructure works. The Roadworks Mechanization Project7\nwas a loan program designed to increase productivity through the development of mechanized\nconstruction  and  maintenance  techniques.  The  most  recent,  the  East-West  Highway\n                                                \n5  A dzongkhag is a district.\n6 Loan 637-BHU(SF): Multiproject, for $5.0 million, approved on 22 September 1983.\n7  Loan 790-BHU(SF): Roadworks Mechanization Project, for $4.5 million, approved on 30 September 1986.", "6\nMaintenance Project,8 was intended to cover the resurfacing of the highway and to support the\ndevelopment of a private sector contracting industry in Bhutan. Throughout these loan periods,\nADB also funded nine TA projects in the sector for project preparation and for the institutional\nstrengthening of DOR. Those projects were designed in part to improve the capacity of the\nGovernment and the private sector, as responsibility for the roads continues to be shifted from\nIBRO. Most recently an ADB-funded TA9 resulted in a complete overhaul of the construction\ncontracting procurement process, including road works. The new framework has been included\nin  the  Government\u2019s  Financial  Manual  and  will  bring  the  process  in  Bhutan  closer  to\ninternational standards.\nD. Lessons Learned\n19. The Multiproject (footnote 6) was completed and a project performance audit report was\nprepared. The report found that greater efforts to familiarize the executing agencies with ADB\nprocedures  and  practices  would  have  minimized  implementation  delays,  and  that  training\nprograms for the DOR engineers needed to be developed. The Roadworks Mechanization\nProject  (footnote  7)  was  aimed  at  increasing  DOR\u2019s  productivity  in  road  construction  and\nmaintenance  by  providing  equipment  and  workshop  facilities,  and  training  DOR  staff  in\nmechanized road construction operation and equipment maintenance. With ADB approval, the\nequipment procured under the loan was subsequently sold to the private sector in line with the\nGovernment\u2019s policy of privatization.\n20. The East-West Highway Maintenance Project (footnote 8) encountered problems with\nthe introduction of a bituminous surface treatment technique new to Bhutan, and with the start-\nup and equipping of five inexperienced contractors. During the resulting delay of almost three\nyears, the road continued to deteriorate, so much so that the improvements proposed during\nproject preparation became inadequate and obsolete. Construction supervision for the project\nwas  provided  under  an  ADB  TA10  grant  requested  by  the  Government.  Timing  problems\noccurred in the fielding of the consultants recruited by ADB, mainly due to the start-up of the\ninexperienced  contractors.  A  road  management  maintenance  system  (RMMS)  was  also\ndeveloped under an associated TA.11 The RMMS component was not successful because the\nproposed system was inappropriate in the light of the institutional capacity of DOR at that time.\nHowever,  the  resulting  program  of  periodic  maintenance  on  roughly  half  the  project  road\narrested the rapid deterioration taking place. The project also facilitated the establishment of a\nprivatized roads construction industry.\n21. These  lessons  were  incorporated  during  project  preparation  in  the  feasibility  study.\nBecause detailed design of the Project will be undertaken immediately prior to the tendering and\naward of construction contracts, very little road deterioration will occur between design and\nconstruction. Also, the minimum resurfacing intervention proposed for the Project is a double\nbituminous surface treatment (DBST), which is twice the pavement coverage of the single\nbituminous surface treatment originally specified in the previous project. Therefore, the cost\nestimates  developed  should  closely  represent  final  construction  costs.  Additionally,  design\ninterventions for the Project include improvement of roadside drainage and slope protection\n                                                \n8  Loan 1265-BHU(SF): East-West Highway Maintenance Project, for $5.2 million, approved on 18 November\n1993.\n9 TA 2802-BHU: Improvement of a Regulatory Framework for Procurement and Contracting, for $400,000,\napproved on 23 May 1997.\n10  TA 1985-BHU: Construction Management, for $740,000, approved on 18 November 1993.\n11  TA 1984-BHU: Development of a Maintenance Management System, for $390,000, approved on 18 November\n1993.", "7\nworks. Consulting services for the Project will be carried out by a team of international and\ndomestic consultants and will provide design, construction supervision, and institutional support\nto the project management office (PMO). The consultants will also provide several training\nworkshops for DOR personnel. The PMO will provide counterpart staff to monitor construction\nactivities and concur with the consultants regarding project progress and quantity certifications;\nthe  arrangement  will  present  an  excellent  opportunity  for  technology  transfer.  Consulting\nservices  will  be  fully  funded  out  of  the  loan  proceeds,  thus  enhancing  the  Government\u2019s\nownership of the Project. Details of the design approach and technical standards are presented\nin Appendix 4.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n22. To translate ADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty reduction into a strategy and operational\nprogram, it is necessary to reflect the reality of Bhutan\u2019s development context, considering (i)\nthe nature and degree of poverty; (ii) the effectiveness of the Government\u2019s economic and\nsocial development programs in addressing basic human needs; (iii) the country\u2019s access to\ngrant funds from India, other bilateral sources, and the United Nations; (iv) the country\u2019s debt-\nservicing  and  project  implementation  capacities;  and  (v)  the  likely  initiatives  of  other  aid\nagencies. Reducing poverty requires continued economic growth. ADB is well positioned to\nsupport poverty reduction by promoting economic growth and social inclusiveness, through\ninterventions in physical and social infrastructure, private sector development, employment\ncreation, and improved economic management. Given the Government\u2019s determination to see\nthe  private  sector  play  the  main  role  in  the  future  growth  of  incomes  and  employment\nopportunities, ADB addresses the following areas: (i) strengthening the capacity of government\nagencies, (ii) improving the physical and social infrastructure, (iii) promoting private sector\ndevelopment, (iv) improving the efficiency of public service delivery and cost recovery, and (v)\nprotecting the environment.\n23. ADB\u2019s strategy in the road sector is consistent with the overall areas of emphasis and\nwith the objectives of the current Eighth Five-Year Plan. The strategic objective is to improve\nroad maintenance to (i) integrate the domestic market; (ii) enhance access to local, regional,\nand international markets; (iii) increase employment opportunities and incomes, especially in\nrural areas, to reduce poverty; (iv) stimulate private sector activity, especially in rural areas; and\n(v) develop public/private partnerships for planning, managing, and implementing construction\nand  maintenance  of  the  national  road  network.  Those  issues  will  be  addressed  during\nimplementation of the Project and the TA. The TA will also assist in improving the planning of\nnew  investments  and  management  of  the  existing  national  road  network,  recommending\nefficient  budget  allocations  for  road  expenditures,  and  contributing  to  the  institutional\nstrengthening of DOR. The TA will also assist the Government in drafting and enacting a Road\nAct (para. 15). In summary, ADB\u2019s sector strategy aims at maximizing the sustainability of the\nroad sector in Bhutan through  (i) capacity building and clearly defining the responsibility of\nDOR, (ii) introducing simple planning procedures for maintenance and improvement works, (iii)\ndevising adequate cost recovery mechanisms, and (iv) contracting out maintenance works to\nthe private sector.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n24. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government in the road sector has concentrated on the\ninstitutional strengthening of DOR to enable it to take over from IBRO the responsibility for\nplanning and managing the national road network. Under the East-West Highway Maintenance\nProject  (footnote  8),  emphasis  was  given  to  (i)  improving  governance  by  institutional", "8\nstrengthening;  (ii)  allocating  funds  for  road  maintenance  operations  more  efficiently;  (iii)\ndeveloping the domestic road construction industry; (iv) establishing a framework for contracting\nroadworks; and (v) improving cost recovery in the road sector through appropriate user charges.\nThe Project and the TA will continue to address the above policy areas, and will improve\ngovernance by strengthening DOR to (i) develop a Road Sector Master Plan with an upgraded\nroad planning and management system, to facilitate efficient budget allocations for road sector\ndevelopment and maintenance activities; (ii) introduce a more participatory approach for the\nbeneficiaries in planning and implementation to contribute to poverty reduction; (iii) improve\nroad safety; (iv) develop the domestic consulting profession; and (v) assist the Government in\ndrafting and enacting a Road Act.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n25. The social and economic well-being of Bhutan is related to an effective and sustainable\nroad transport network as no other mode of transport is available for the movement of people\nand goods. The extreme geographic conditions and mountainous terrain pose challenges to the\nprovision  of  transport  links  and  to  its  necessary  maintenance.  The  existing  national  road\nnetwork is in need of improvement and protection as the deteriorated road surface makes\njourneys longer and more difficult. Frequent landslides also block the roads\u2014sometimes for\nmore than a week at a time\u2014causing major delays in movement by vehicle or on foot. Heavy\nsnow cover in winter also hinders movement. The East-West Highway, the project road, was\nconstructed to a single-lane standard by IBRO during 1965-1985. It connects Thimphu in the\nwest and Trashigang in the east. The road is of strategic importance to Bhutan since it is the\nonly means of transport between those two important towns. The highway also links a number\nof other urban centers along the route including Wangdue-Phodrang, Trongsa, Jakar, and\nMongar and acts as the only collector of traffic from the urban centers north and south of the\nroute.\n26. The  Project  will  address  the  following  aspects  of  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  and  policy\ndialogue:  (i)  integrate  the  domestic  market;  (ii)  enhance  access  to  local,  regional,  and\ninternational markets; (iii) increase employment opportunities and incomes, especially in rural\nareas, to reduce poverty; (iv) stimulate private sector activity, especially in rural areas; (v)\ndevelop public/private partnerships for planning, managing, and implementing construction and\nmaintenance  of  the  national  road  network;  (vi)  improve  road  safety;  and  (vii)  develop  the\ndomestic consulting profession.  The TA, which will be implemented concurrently with the\nProject, will improve governance by strengthening DOR.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n27. The objectives are to (i) promote private sector participation and assist in developing the\ndomestic contracting and consulting industries by introducing a pilot contractor and equipment\nleasing scheme; (ii) reduce poverty by enhancing employment opportunities for the poor and\nimproving access to health, education, and other social services; and (iii) improve governance\nby providing institutional support to DOR. The Project will undertake improvements on the East-\nWest Highway, including resurfacing, construction of line drainage, and slope protection works.\nBecause the project road is the only east-west link, the country will benefit from improved\ntransport accessibility, savings in road maintenance costs, and reduction in VOCs. The Project\u2019s\nobjectives are consistent with the Government\u2019s priorities for road sector development under the\nEighth Five-Year Plan.", "9\n28. The Project will consist of the following components: (i) resurfacing about 380 km on the\nEast-West Highway, using mechanized techniques in an environmentally sound manner and\nincorporating all related drainage works; (ii) improving slope stability to preserve the existing\nnational highway network; (iii) implementing a pilot contractor and equipment leasing scheme\nfor domestic contractors to participate in the Project; and (iv) providing consulting services for\ndesign and supervision of civil works and for institutional support.\nC. Cost Estimates\n29. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $12.8 million equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is estimated at $8.7 million representing 68 percent of the total cost and the local\ncurrency cost is estimated at $4.1 million equivalent representing 32 percent of total cost. The\ncost estimates are summarized in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.\nTable 1:  Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n30. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $9.6 million equivalent from its Special Funds\nresources to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project and about 22 percent of the\nlocal currency cost, which represents 8 percent of total project cost. The provision for financing\nof local currency costs is justified under ADB\u2019s local currency financing policy.12 The loan will\nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1 percent\n                                                \n12  R-1-95, Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects, 3 January 1995.", "10\nper annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.

The Executing Agency\n31. The Department of Roads will be the Executing Agency for the proposed Project. DOR,\nwhich  is  headed  by  a  director  under  MOC,  is  responsible  for  design,  construction,  and\nmaintenance  of  roads  and  bridges.  A  PMO  was  established  within  DOR  before  loan\nnegotiations. The PMO will be responsible for coordinating, implementing, and monitoring the\nProject.  A  full-time  project  manager  heads  the  PMO  and  is  supported  by  adequate  and\ncompetent technical and administrative personnel. The project manager will be delegated with\nsufficient authority to permit effective decision making on project implementation matters. The\norganization chart of the PMO is presented in Appendix 6. The Government will provide DOR\nwith adequate budgetary allocations for timely implementation of the Project. DOR has gained\nadequate experience in project implementation through the previous ADB road projects in the\ncountry.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1. Implementation Schedule\n32. The Project will be implemented over a period of about four years. Civil works are\nexpected to commence around June 2001 and be completed by the end of December 2004.\nBecause of the harsh winter and monsoon rains in the summer, the work seasons in the project\narea are limited. This schedule assumes the consultant is mobilized by January 2001. The\ntentative implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 7.\n2.  Procurement\n33. All goods and services financed under the Project will be procured in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. All civil works, the largest having a value of $1.5 million, will\nbe awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) according to the Government\u2019s\nstandard  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  civil  works  contractors  will  be\nprequalified.  As  the  contracts  are  relatively  small,  they  are  unlikely  to  attract  significant\ninternational interest. All bidding documents will include clauses to reflect ADB\u2019s policy on anti-", "11\ncorruption. The bidding documents will also include provisions on environmental protection,\nchild labor, and prevention of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS.13\n34. The use of local competitive bidding for these contracts will provide an opportunity to\nstrengthen the emerging domestic contracting industry whose development was initiated in part\nthrough the East-West Highway Maintenance Project (footnote 8). The proposed pilot contractor\nscheme,  with  small  contracts  for  periodic  maintenance  and  slope  stability  improvements,\nenables  contractors  with  less  experience  in  road  works  to  participate  in  the  Project,  thus\nexpanding the local construction industry\u2019s capability to carry out road improvement works.\n35. Equipment or materials estimated at $500,000 equivalent or less will be procured by\ninternational shopping procedures, except that equipment or materials estimated at less than\n$100,000 equivalent per item will be procured through direct purchase. Under the Project a\ncontract package for road improvement equipment for the Mechanical Division, estimated at\n$400,000  equivalent,  will  be  awarded  through  international  shopping  procedures.  Also,\nmaterials  testing  equipment,  estimated  at  $40,000  equivalent,  will  be  procured  by  direct\npurchase. Indicative procurement packages are presented in Appendix 8.\n3.  Consulting Services\n36. Detailed design, construction supervision, and institutional support for the Project will be\nprovided by an international consulting firm which will collaborate with domestic consultants.\nThe consultants will be engaged by DOR in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. Staffing inputs will be about 37 person-months for international consultants and 326\nfor domestic consultants. The consulting services will include components to assist DOR in\nstrengthening its capacity in (i) road construction and maintenance, (ii) contract procurement\nand administration, (iii) slope protection practices, and (iv) road safety measures. Due to the\nlimited availability of domestic consultants from the private sector, the international consultants\nmay be required to draw from DOR suitable staff to assist in project implementation. The\nGovernment will ensure that arrangements satisfactory to ADB are made for release of DOR\nstaff to participate in the Project, as domestic consultants independent of DOR, together with\ndomestic consultants from the private sector. The overall period of service will be about 48\nmonths. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services for design, supervision, and\ninstitutional support are in Appendix 9.\n37. To expedite the civil works and make optimum use of suitable construction weather, the\nGovernment has obtained ADB approval of advance action on recruitment of consultants. The\nGovernment has been informed that the advance action does not commit ADB to approve the\nsubsequent Project. The consultants are expected to commence work in January 2001. DOR\nissued invitations for proposals in August 2000.\n4. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n38. The Project does not involve any land acquisition or resettlement, as the works to be\nundertaken  will  be  confined  to  resurfacing  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  The  rules  and\nregulations issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs14 specifies that no one will be permitted to\nconstruct or erect or install any kind of house or fence within 50 feet on either side of the road.\n                                                \n13  Human-immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n14 Rules and Regulations for Construction of Semi-Permanent and Permanent Houses on Either Side of the Roads.", "12\nThe walkover survey along the project road found no squatters within the right-of-way. Since\nthere  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  this  Project,  no  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement plan is needed.\n5. Disbursements\n39. Loan  disbursements  for  the  consulting  services  contract  to  be  procured  through\ninternational selection will be by direct payment procedures. Disbursements for the civil works\ncontract  packages  and  for  incremental  expenditures  will  be  through  imprest  account\nprocedures. The Government will establish an imprest account at the Bank of Bhutan. The\nimprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated June 1996, as amended from time to time, and\ndetailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited\nwill be based on the estimated expenditures over six months.\n6. Midterm Review\n40. The Government and ADB will conduct regular reviews during project implementation. In\naddition, they will jointly carry out a midterm review of the Project during the second year of civil\nworks implementation. The results of the midterm review will be discussed by the parties and, if\nrequired,  appropriate  corrective  measures  will  be  carried  out  to  ensure  successful  project\nimplementation and achievement of the objectives.\n7. Reporting Requirements\n41. The supervision consultant will prepare brief monthly progress reports to be submitted to\nthe Ministries of Finance and Communications, DOR, and ADB. The reports will provide details\nof the Project, including events or activities not progressing satisfactorily, and remedial actions\nrecommended by the consultants and DOR to resolve problems. The format of the reports will\nbe agreed upon during contract negotiations for consulting services. DOR will also prepare and\nsubmit quarterly progress reports to ADB. Once the works are complete, DOR will arrange for\nthe  consultants  to  prepare  and  submit  a  project  completion  report  within  three  months  of\nphysical completion of the Project.\n8. Records, Accounts, and Audit\n42. DOR will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to (i) identify the goods and\nservices financed from the loan proceeds and from counterpart funding; (ii) identify the use of\nthese goods and services to the Project; (iii) record the progress of the Project, including its\ncost; and (iv) reflect, in accordance with consistently maintained sound accounting principles,\nthe Project\u2019s operational and financial condition. The project accounts and related financial\nstatements will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and\nrelated financial statements, to be prepared in English, will be submitted to ADB not later than\nnine months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n 9. Project Performance Monitoring System\n43. During project implementation, DOR, with the assistance of the consultants, will carry\nout project performance monitoring system (PPMS) activities under arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB to ensure efficient management of project activities and maximization of project benefits.\nThe  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  performance  indicators  (Appendix  10)  for", "13\ncarrying out these PPMS activities. The findings and supporting data will be incorporated into\nthe project performance monitoring and evaluation report for the completed Project. Community-\nbased organizations in the geog,15 in association with the DOR, will verify the effectiveness of\nproject activities and outputs, as well as the reactions of the intended beneficiaries. A sociologist\non the consulting team will assist DOR with that task. The project performance and monitoring\nevaluation will allow postevaluation of the Project, and also improve planning for future road\nimprovement projects.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Impacts\n44. Consultants  for  the  project  feasibility  study  conducted  an  initial  environmental\nexamination  (IEE)  of  the  Project,  following  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for Selected\nInfrastructure Projects (Highways and Roads). The summary IEE is presented in Appendix 11.\nThe IEE indicated no significant environmental problems associated with the Project, which will\ninvolve only improvements consisting of periodic maintenance of existing roads, line drainage,\nand  slope  protection  works  along  the  existing  alignments.  The  Project  will  reduce  the\nenvironmental  impact  of  the  without-project  scenario,  especially  in  relation  to  siting  and\noperation of quarries, slope failure caused by inadequate drainage, and use of firewood for\nheating bitumen. DOR will ensure that the environmental impacts of the Project are minimized\nby carrying out the recommendations specified in the IEE and as agreed upon with ADB. The\nProject includes the following enhancement measures:\n(i)  Slope stabilization. For continuous access, slope stabilization is the most important\nenhancement measure. Pavement and drainage works are only part of the answer\nto ensuring continued road operation. Additional and improved slope stabilization\nworks  are  required  in  many  areas.  Implementing  an  appropriate  slope-related\nprogram will maximize the effectiveness of the funds available to DOR. A 13-point\naction  plan  covering  a  range  of  slope  stability  issues,  in  order  of  priority,  is\npresented  in  the  Slope  Stabilization  Manual.16  In  addition,  it  is  strongly\nrecommended that DOR consider more extensive use of bioengineering measures.\n(ii)  Water management. The Project offers an opportunity to assist some communities\nwith irrigation water supply and to solve problems of uncontrolled irrigation water\ndisposal.  The Project will assist both the Ministry of Agriculture and DOR to install\ndual-purpose roadside water management structures where needed.\n(iii)  Road  safety.  The  Project  provides  an  opportunity  to  improve  road  safety  by\nincorporating various engineering measures in the program of works.\n2. Social Measures\n45. As part of project preparation, a social assessment was carried out using participatory as\nwell as survey methodologies in the project area. The assessment consisted of socioeconomic\nsurveys, and focus group discussions with key stakeholders such as the Planning Commission\nSecretariat and the Health and Education ministries, government officials in the dzongkhag\n(footnote 5) social sector administrators in nine dzongkhag in the project area, Road Safety and\n                                                \n15  A geog is a cluster of villages.\n16  The Slope Stabilization Manual was prepared under TA 3107-BHU (footnote 2).", "14\nTransport  Authority,  Bhutan  Development  and  Finance  Corporation,  Royal  Bhutan  Women\nAssociation, and Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. During the Fact-Finding Mission,\nrapid rural appraisal was conducted for road workers and beneficiaries in several project areas\nto assess the potential employment opportunity as well as beneficiaries\u2019 needs and constraints.\n46. The Project is expected to have a positive social impact. The documented stakeholder\nconsultations confirm widespread support for the Project. The Project will contribute to more\nrapid economic growth of the project area by expanding economic opportunities, particularly in\nagriculture, cottage industry, and tourism. Furthermore, the Project will improve the overall\nquality of life for rural people and reduce poverty by creating employment opportunities for the\npoor  through  project  construction  and  maintenance  activities;  and  improving  access  to\neconomic  and  social  opportunities,  schools,  health  services,  and  other  social  as  well  as\ngovernment services. Construction and maintenance works under the Project will require mostly\nunskilled labor and will generate direct income-earning opportunities, particularly for the poor\nand women.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Analysis\n47. Improving the road conditions on the East-West Highway will produce mainly road user\nbenefits, such as savings in VOCs and travel time. For the analysis, road user benefits were\nrestricted to savings in VOCs arising from changes in surface roughness. Additionally, since\ntransport costs are relatively high and improvements offer significant transport cost savings,\nwhich will stimulate the local economy, there will also be development benefits that include an\nincrease in the quantity and quality of agricultural production in the project area, tourism, and\nsmall-scale industrial development. These benefits can be measured in terms of net value of\ngenerated output directly attributable to road rehabilitation or in terms of the transport cost\nbenefits  accruing  generated  traffic.17  However,  it  is  essential  that  the  two  approaches  be\npursued separately to avoid double counting. The methodology concentrated on road user\nbenefits and adopted the approach of measuring economic development benefits in terms of the\nbenefits gained by generated traffic.\n48. Economic evaluation was carried out by comparing the costs and benefits for the with-\nand  without-project  scenarios.  Benefits  based  on  VOC  savings,  in  economic  prices,  were\ncalculated  for  normal  and  generated  traffic.  These  benefits  were  compared  with  the  road\nimprovement and maintenance costs to calculate the economic internal rate of return (EIRR).\nBenefit streams were calculated for a period of 20 years starting in 2001. Costs and benefits\nwere estimated net of duties and taxes, and were expressed in constant end-1999 prices. The\nbase EIRR for the Project is 32 percent.\n49. The sensitivity of the EIRRs to changes in the underlying cost and benefit parameters\nwas analyzed. The results show that the adverse assumption of a 15 percent increase in project\ncost would decrease the EIRR to 27 percent. If benefits materialized to only 85 percent of the\noriginal estimates, the EIRR would decrease to 27 percent. In a more adverse situation of a\nsimultaneous increase in project cost by 15 percent and a reduction of benefits by 15 percent,\n                                                \n17  As mentioned in para. 7, freight rates are determined by the market and passenger fares are regulated but\nperiodically reviewed. During the economic evaluation, the estimated VOCs showed similarities with the rates\nand fares actually charged in the market. This increases the confidence that VOC savings will be passed on to\nthe users.", "15\nthe overall EIRR will be 22 percent.  The switching value18 for cost was determined to be 100\npercent, and switching value for benefits 49 percent. If project implementation is delayed by two\nyears, the EIRR will be reduced to 20 percent. Also, if only benefits due to VOC savings of\nnormal traffic are considered, the EIRR will decrease to 25 percent. The economic analysis is\ngiven in Appendix 12.\nB. Social Dimensions\n50. The social impact assessment (Appendix 13) served to inform the communities about\nthe Project and its implications, and elicited their suggestions, views on mitigation measures,\nand the role they could play. The local community, particularly the poor, will be informed and\nencouraged  to  engage  in  road  construction  and  maintenance  activities.  It  is  important  to\nmaximize the participation of the local community in road construction, slope protection, and\nmaintenance activities.\n1. Project Beneficiaries\n51. The Project will directly benefit approximately 60,000 people. Based on the feasibility\nreport on the poverty profile of the population affected by the Project, 38 percent of households\nare below the estimated poverty line level of Bhutan.19 The beneficiaries of the Project will be (i)\nthe  poor  who  will  achieve  more  mobility  in  seeking  employment  and  income-generating\nopportunities; (ii) entrepreneurs and small traders who will be able to set up enterprises along\nthe road; (iii) agricultural enterprises that will benefit from faster, cheaper, and reliable access to\nlarge markets and export opportunities; (iv) neighboring countries that can utilize the route for\nimproved access to Thimphu, thereby promoting regional cooperation; (v) passenger traffic\nalong  the  Thimphu-Wangdue  Phodrang-Bumthang-Mongar-Trashigang  routes;  and  (vi)\nexporters and importers who will benefit from reduced transportation cost for freight using the\nshorter project route. Road construction and slope protection, which requires mostly unskilled\nlabor, will generate direct income-earning opportunities, particularly for the poor. Over four\nyears, the Project will provide approximately 300,000 person-days of unskilled employment\nopportunities, particularly for the poor and women.\n2. Impact on Indigenous People and Cultural Properties\n52. Data from the social assessment and other available documents show no separate\ndisadvantaged groups who are likely to be adversely affected by the Project. Accordingly, there\nis  no  need  to  prepare  an  indigenous  people  development  plan.  Also,  the  Project  will  not\nadversely affect any cultural property. In fact, the Project will facilitate access to some of the\nhighly revered spiritual centers in Bhutan.\n                                                \n18  The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required\nfor the net present value (NPV) to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cut-off level of 12\npercent.\n19  Since no documented information on the poverty line of Bhutan is available, its assessment was based on the\nsame yardstick (primarily daily calorie intake food of 2,200 calorie per person per day) as that followed in India,\nadjusted to consider nuances relevant to Bhutan, such as expenditure on transport, shelter, clothing, fuel, etc.\nThis is estimated to be around Nu504 per person per month or $144 per capita per year (December 1998 price\nlevel).", "16\n3. Gender Impact\n53. The Project has sought opportunities to address gender concerns in road construction-\nrelated activities. Women will benefit from the Project through their participation in roadwork\nopportunities, particularly in road construction, slope protection, and maintenance works. Since\nwomen in Bhutan are active producers and marketers of food, reducing the transport burden of\nrural women would release their time and energy for more productive and socially beneficial\nactivities. The Project is expected to facilitate access to existing health, social services, and\nschools, making it possible for teachers, of which the majority are women, to commute from\ntowns to village schools; and will enable dzongdag or district administrators to establish new\nschools and recruit more teachers. As a result, the enrollment rates are expected to increase for\nboth boys and girls, but the rate for girls, which had been much lower than for boys, could\nincrease more.\n4. Participatory Approach\n54. The participatory approach was conducted during feasibility (footnote 2), fact-finding and\nappraisal to assess poverty from the perspective of a range of stakeholders and to involve them\nin the planning for follow-up action. Furthermore, the social assessment aims to inform the\naffected  people  about  the  Project  and  its  implications  and  elicit  their  views  on  mitigation\nmeasures, suggestions, and role they could play. The local community, particularly the poor, will\nbe informed and encouraged to engage in road improvement and maintenance activities. It is\nimportant  to  maximize  the  participation  of  local  community  in  road  improvement  and\nmaintenance activities.\n55. As part of project preparation an assessment of the well being of women road workers\nwas conducted.20 The participatory gender assessment of the road workers covered different\nparts  of  the  country  and  provided  a  sound  base  for  planning  programs  for  improving  the\nconditions and well-being of road workers in general, and women and children in particular. A\nsurvey was carried out along the East-West Highway. Primary data generated through field visit,\ninterview, and questionnaire formed the baseline information to determine gender ratio, working\nconditions, effectiveness of the World Food Program, social and welfare facilities available; and\nidentify constraints and opportunities. This was supplemented by the analysis of policies on the\nnational workforce, secondary information on the role of private contractors and Government\nagencies, and consultations with relevant authorities.\n5. Local Labor\n56. The  Government  encourages  private  construction  companies  to  employ  local  labor\ninstead of imported labor from India and Nepal for road construction. Any negative impact on\ngroups and individuals will be identified and remedied. For example, the use of child labor in\nconstruction activities is not allowed. Close monitoring during supervision will pay attention to\nthe specific contractual clauses incorporated in the sample bidding documents.\n6.  Communicable Diseases\n57. In addition to the provisions included in each civil works contract, the Government is\ncurrently  taking  necessary  measures  to  promote  awareness  and  to  prevent  the  spread  of\n                                                \n20  Under TA 5889-REG: Gender and Development Initiatives, for $850,000, approved on 13 December 1999.", "17\ncommunicable diseases, including sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and HIV/AIDS. ADB is\nalso supporting Government\u2019s efforts under the proposed Health Care Reform Program.\nC. Impact on Poverty Reduction\n58. Under ADB\u2019s current project classification system, the Project\u2019s primary objective is\neconomic growth and the secondary objective poverty reduction as it targets the poorer areas of\nthe country. Under the new project classification effective 2001, the Project would be classified\nas pro-poor growth. The overall project strategy of poverty reduction was formulated in terms of\nthree  approaches:  (i)  pro-poor  growth;  (ii)  improved  quality  of  life;  and  (iii)  employment\nopportunities for the poorest population of the country.\n1. Pro-Poor growth\n59. More rapid economic development is expected to lead to a significant reduction in\npoverty in the hinterland and eastern regions. Existing poverty is rooted in the lack of economic\nopportunity  and  the  associated  lack  of  sufficient  employment  opportunity  and  livelihood\nactivities. Survey data on occupational distribution suggests that many of the poor in the project\narea  are  in  agriculture  (as  casual  laborers),  cottage  industries,  and  construction,  or  are\nunemployed. The expected diversification of agriculture and expansion of potentially better paid\nemployment in small industries and tourism are therefore likely to have especially significant\npoverty reduction impacts.\n60. For farmers in general, an improved transport network can also ease the introduction of\nimproved farming practices and the transition from subsistence farming to cash crops and a\nmarket economy. Improved access to transportation also lowers the costs of inputs such as\nfertilizer.  Reliable  access,  e.g.,  all-weather  possibilities  to  input  and  output  markets,  can\nstimulate higher cash-crop farming production and more stable incomes, and enable the poor to\nimprove their management of risks. The Project will benefit the urban population as well. For\nexample, food prices for the urban poor could be reduced.\n2. Improved Quality of Life\n61. The  Project  will  have  direct  impacts  on  the  quality  of  life  of  all  income  groups.\nImprovements of the East-West Highway will not only provide people with more convenient\naccess to a broad range of socioeconomic opportunities, but also have strong income effects by\nlowering transport costs, and hence, the prices of consumer goods and services. In these ways,\nthe Project will contribute to improved personal welfare. Lack of affordable access deprives the\npoor of the ability to take advantage of job opportunities and even of very basic social services.\nReliable access to schools and health services contributes directly to the poor\u2019s accumulation of\nhuman capital, which is a key factor in sustainable poverty reduction.\n3. Employment Opportunities for the Poor\n62. The Project will generate demand for mostly unskilled labor and provide income-earning\nopportunities  for  the  poor  and  women.  It  will  provide  local  communities  with  employment\nopportunities offered by the privatized road construction companies. This could be of particular\nvalue to households with very small plots and/or few animals and who have to sharecrop other\nfarmers\u2019 land, or who have available time. These tend to be the poorest families. Since the\nProject will generate jobs for the poor who are otherwise unemployed or underemployed, it will\ncontribute to poverty reduction. Moreover, the Project will directly benefit the road workers. In", "18\nthe project area, there are 2,748 road workers of whom 40 percent are women who work on the\nroads and are paid by DOR. Road workers are among the neediest and poorest groups in the\ncountry. Illiteracy and insufficient land have forced them to leave their villages to join the\nworkforce. By working in the private construction companies for this Project, they will get 40\npercent more income than working with DOR. Therefore, the Project will improve their income-\nearning opportunity.\nD. Risks\n63. The project risks mainly relate to the implementation arrangements. Due to possible\ninclement weather conditions, it will be important to adhere to the implementation schedule.\nDomestic contractors have learned from experience under the previous ADB Project (footnote\n8) about the engineering requirements of the different resurfacing treatments. In addition, there\nwill be international consulting services for design and supervision and institutional support to\nDOR. It will be important that DOR establish a properly staffed PMO with qualified counterpart\npersonnel, for the duration of the Project, both in its Thimphu headquarters and in the field\nwhere the improvement works will take place.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n64. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)   The  Government  will  provide  DOR  with  adequate  budgetary  allocations  for  timely\nimplementation of the Project.\n(ii)   Within  two  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  plan  its  road  sector\ninvestments and asset management activities based on the Road Sector Master Plan,\nwhich will be developed under the TA for Road Planning and Management Strengthening\nProject and agreed upon with ADB.\n(iii)   Within one year after loan effectiveness, DOR, with the assistance of the consultants, will\nimplement  a  pilot  contractor  and  equipment  leasing  scheme,  under  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB, for domestic contractors to participate in the Project by (a) providing\nassistance in civil works contract management; and (b) leasing equipment owned by\nDOR\u2019s Mechanical Division to domestic contractors.\n(iv)   Based on the outcome of the TA study (footnote 4), the Government will, within three\nyears after loan effectiveness, and in consultation with ADB, levy user charges to recover\nthe costs incurred in maintaining the national road network.\n(v)   Within three years after loan effectiveness, the Government will (a) consult with ADB on\nany  major  changes  made  to  the  draft  legislation  on  the  proposed  Road  Act  before\npresenting it to the Cabinet and the National Assembly; and (b) enact and make effective\nthe proposed Road Act.\n(vi)   The Government will ensure that arrangements satisfactory to ADB are made for release\nof DOR staff to participate in the Project as domestic consultants independent of DOR,\ntogether with domestic consultants from the private sector.", "19\n(vii)   Upon completion of the Project, the Government will ensure that all periodic maintenance\nworks on the national highway network are tendered out to the private sector.\n(viii)   During and after project implementation, the Government will prepare annual plans on the\nnational  road  network  taking  into  account  physical  measurements,  maintenance\nstandards, and traffic volumes. Based on these annual plans, the Government will (a)\nprovide  appropriate  maintenance  of  the  national  road  network;  and  (b)  ensure  that\nadequate and timely allocation of resources are made available for the maintenance of the\nnational road network.\nB. Condition for Award of Contract\n65. DOR will not award any civil works contract under the Project until after it has obtained\nfrom the National Environment Commission the necessary environmental clearance related to\nthat contract.\nVII.

Background\n1. The objective of the proposed Project is to undertake road improvements on the East-\nWest Highway in Bhutan. The RIP will involve (i) design of periodic maintenance interventions,\n(ii) slope protection and drainage improvements, and (iii) consulting services and institutional\nsupport.\n2. The  terms  of  reference  for  the  Road  Network  Study,1  under  which  the  Project  was\nprepared,  required  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultant  to  prepare  a  prioritized  road\nimprovement  program  for  the  project  roads  that  will  facilitate  the  social  and  economic\ndevelopment of Bhutan. The study included three roads totaling 941 kilometers (km). The\npriority  link  in  Bhutan  is  the  East-West  Highway,  546  km  long,  between  Trashigang  and\nSimtokha.  Two  other  north-south  routes,  between  Wangdue-Phodrang  and  Sarpang  and\nTrongsa and Gelephu, were also studied.\n3. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2013assisted East-West Highway Maintenance Project,2\ncompleted in 1998, made periodic maintenance interventions along portions of the project road\nand  assisted  in  developing  a  private  sector  contracting  industry  in  Bhutan.  Most  of  the\ninterventions remain in good condition, with only occasional and minor routine maintenance\nrepairs necessary. However, some portions have not performed up to expectations and require\nfurther  intervention.  The  previous  project  introduced  new  construction  methods  to  nascent\nprivate contractors. Inexperience with mechanized paving methods in the past contributed to the\nearly deterioration of some roadway improvements. The Project will benefit from the previous\nexperience and apply the lessons learned in its implementation.\nB. Lessons Learned\n4. The  original  design  for  roadway  improvements  under  the  East-West  Highway\nMaintenance Project called for resurfacing using single bituminous surface treatment (SBST).\nThe  road  deteriorated  faster  than  anticipated  and,  because  of  severe  delays  in  initial\nimplementation required a more significant resurfacing intervention\u2013double bituminous surface\ntreatment (DBST)\u2013once construction began. This markedly increased the resurfacing cost per\nkm. To remain within the project budget, lengths of roadway improvement originally planned had\nto  be  dropped  from  the  project.  Also,  the  previous  design  interventions  did  not  include\nimprovement of roadside drainage or slope protection works. Insufficient water drainage and\ninadequate slope protection along a roadway contribute significantly to road deterioration.\n5. The detailed design for the Project will be made immediately before the tendering and\naward of construction contracts. As such, very little road deterioration is expected to occur\nbetween  design  and  construction,  and  no  significant  increase  in  improvements  should  be\nrequired once construction starts. The minimum resurfacing intervention proposed is DBST,\nwhich  is  twice  the  pavement  coverage  of  the  SBST  specified  in  the  previous  project.\nConsequently, upgrades in design are less likely to be necessary, and the cost estimates\ndeveloped in the final design should closely represent the final construction costs.\n                                                \n1  TA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.\n2  Loan 1265-BHU (SF): East-West Highway Maintenance Project, for $5.2 million, approved on 18 November\n1993.", "28\nAppendix 4, page 2\n6. As noted, some sections improved under the previous project did not meet performance\nexpectations. Due to unfamiliarity with mechanized methods as well as equipment breakdowns,\nportions of the road were resurfaced using manual placement methods. This, in addition to the\ninsufficient  drainage  that  existed,  undoubtedly  contributed  to  the  poor  performance  of  the\nroadway.  To  prevent  the  problem  from  recurring,  all  resurfacing  will  utilize  mechanized\noperations. Further, the Project Management Office (PMO) will procure new paving equipment\nas part of the plant hire scheme. It should be noted that several domestic contractors in the\nprevious project did gain experience in the mechanized placement of road resurfacing. These\ncontractors have maintained their equipment plant and complement of trained personnel and\nstand ready to participate in the Project.\n7. Construction  supervision  in  the  previous  project  also  proved  inappropriate  and\ninadequate. With ADB funding from a TA grant, two independent international consultants were\nfielded to provide construction supervision support. This arrangement was not successful, as\nevidenced in part by early deterioration of some road resurfacing improvements, and services\nwere terminated earlier than originally planned. Working with a grant, the Department of Roads\n(DOR) did not assume significant ownership of construction supervision. Further, no counterpart\nstaff was assigned to assist with construction monitoring. The geographic distance and time\nrequired traveling between construction sites further hampered proper supervision.\n8. For the Project, a joint team of international and domestic experts will provide design,\nconstruction supervision and institutional support to the PMO. The consultant will also conduct\nseveral training workshops for the benefit of DOR personnel. The consultancy team will be\ncomposed of resident engineers and site supervisors. Each construction contract package will\nbe continuously monitored. The PMO will provide counterpart staff to monitor construction\nactivities  and  concur  with  the  consultant  team  regarding  project  progress  and  quantity\ncertifications; this provides excellent opportunity for technology transfer. The consulting services\nwill be fully funded out of the loan proceeds and not through a TA grant, thus enhancing\nGovernment ownership.\nC. Road Analysis Approach\n9. The  existing  pavements  on  the  East-West  Highway  typically  have  a  base  course\ncomposed of waterbound macadam (WBM) with an average thickness of 320 millimeters (mm).\nA 20-mm bituminous overlay forms the pavement surface. The typical roadway cross-section\nconsists of a single motorized traffic lane 3.5 meters (m) wide with 1.5 m wide shoulders. The\nmaximum design vehicle speed is 80 km per hour (kph). Minimum speeds of 20 kph for light\nvehicles and 15 kph for trucks are applied to avoid unrealistically low journey speeds.\n10. A road roughness survey was conducted using a vehicle-mounted bump integrator and\ncounter to measure the unevenness of the road. A calibrated odometer was used to measure\ndistance  along  the  road.  The  bump  integrator  produced  roughness  values  and  equivalent\nInternational Roughness Indexes (IRI) for all sections of the road studied. The need for other\nexogenous interventions in areas with unlined drains, nonfunctioning culverts, insufficient slope\nprotection, and destroyed pavements was also identified during the survey.\n11. The  physical  surveys  and  reference  data  collection  identified  homogeneous  sections\nalong the road on the basis of traffic volumes, road roughness measurements, altitude, and\nroad gradient. These sections were used in a modified version of the Highway Design and\nMaintenance (HDM) model to prioritize the need for intervention.", "29\nAppendix 4, page 3\n12. The HDM program prioritizes road data input to calculate vehicle operating costs. The\nprogram  was  adapted  to  conditions  specific  to  Bhutan  and  the  East-West  Highway.  For\nexample, a higher likelihood for crack progression was input into the model, due to the poor soil\ntypes and the freeze-thaw cycles prevalent at the higher elevations. A lower rate of rutting\nprogression  was  used  due  to  the  low  traffic  values.  Other  relevant  inputs  were  modified\naccording to Bhutan\u2019s environmental and climatic conditions. The adaptations specialized the\nmodel to give more accurate results for the East-West Highway analysis. Considering other\ncosts, such as maintenance, fuel, lubricant, tires, and license fees, the study recommended the\nneed for periodic maintenance of about 350 km of roads, roughly 63 percent of the total length.\nThat figure was used to develop indicative packages for design interventions.\nD.  Design Philosophy\n13. The study first identified four periodic maintenance interventions, which consider local\ncontractor capabilities, DOR experience, and engineering best practices:\nOption 1: DBST chip seal applied every 6 years.\nOption 2: DBST chip seal applied when roughness IRI is 6.5 m/km.\nOption 3: 100 mm WBM base course with double surface treatment chip seal.\nOption 4: 40 mm hot mix overlay.\n14. The most appropriate rehabilitations for routine and periodic maintenance are option 1\nand option 3. On sections where the existing pavement surface is in fair condition, a DBST\noverlay will be applied to provide a smoother, more uniform riding surface and to protect the\nexisting pavement, thus extending the serviceable life of the road. Road sections in more\ndeteriorated condition will first be strengthened with the WBM base course before receiving the\nDBST overlay. Road sections now severely eroded or destroyed will be reconstructed as part of\nthe exogenous interventions before road surfacing.\n15. The pavements will be designed in accordance with Indian Standards for a 10-year life,\nwith provision for overlays every 7 years to extend the road\u2019s life up to 15-20 years. The designs\nwill be based on traffic counts and traffic projections (for capacity), axle load surveys, deflection\ntests and projections (for structural capacity). With the WBM base course in option 3, the\npavement structure will consist of an improved, well-compacted subgrade, with WBM subbase\nand base courses, which consist of 20-50 mm sizes gravels and 20-25 mm bituminous wearing\ncourse. The roughness values for the existing roads are between IRI6 and 12. The target\nroughness values after periodic maintenance is 5.\n16. Other  exogenous  construction  works  will  also  be  provided  to  ensure  that  periodic\nmaintenance interventions achieve or exceed their intended design life and that the reduction in\nvehicle costs achieves the expected levels. These interventions include slope protection through\nretaining walls or revetments, construction of new culverts and repair of existing ones, and\nconstruction of new lined drains.\n17. The indicative construction packages proposed for the Project are based on the feasibility\nanalysis and preliminary designs. The packages as presented may be revised by the consultant\non the basis of final designs, which will be completed immediately before tendering the works\nfor construction.", "30\nAppendix 4, page 4\nE. Technical Standards\n18. The principal international standards for detailed design are the following:\n(i)  highways: recommendations of Indian Standard (IS), Indian Road Congress (IRC)\nand Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), as in Overseas Road Note 6, TRRL,\nUnited Kingdom;\n(ii)  culverts and other drainage structures: IS; and\n(iii)  pavements testing and design: IS, IRC, and TRL Road Note 31.\n19. The IS and IRC will be used to design all exogenous interventions. DOR standard designs\nfor retaining walls will be used whenever practical.", " 31 Appendix 5  \nSUMMARY COST ESTIMATES a\nAsian Development Bank Government\nItem FX LC Total $ million Percent $ million Percent\nPeriodic Maintenance Works\nBase 5.7 2.8 8.6 6.0 0.70          2.6 0.30\nPhysical 0.6 0.3 0.9 0.6 0.70          0.3 0.30\nPrice 0.5 0.2 0.7 0.5 0.70          0.2 0.30\nTotal 6.8 3.3 10.1 7.1 0.70          3.0 0.30\nSlope Protection Works\nBase 0.4 0.3 0.7 0.5 0.75          0.2 0.25\nPhysical 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.75          0.0 0.25\nPrice 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.0 0.75          0.0 0.25\nTotal 0.4 0.4 0.8 0.6 0.75          0.2 0.25\nConsulting Services\nBase 0.7 0.4 1.1 1.1 1.00          - 0.00\nPhysical 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 1.00          - 0.00\nPrice 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 1.00          - 0.00\nTotal 0.8 0.4 1.2 1.2 1.00          - 0.00\nEquipment\nBase 0.4 0.0 0.4 0.4 1.00          - 0.00\nPhysical 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.00          - 0.00\nPrice 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.00          - 0.00\nTotal 0.5 0.0 0.5 0.5 1.00          - 0.00\nTotal Cost\nBase 7.3 3.5 10.8 8.1 0.75          2.7 0.25\nPhysical 0.7 0.3 1.0 0.7 0.73          0.3 0.27\nPrice 0.6 0.3 0.8 0.6 0.73          0.2 0.27\nTotal 8.5 4.1 12.6 9.4 0.74          3.2 0.26\nInterest Charges 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.2 1.00 0.00\nTotal Cost          8.7          4.1        12.8          9.6 0.75          3.2 0.25\n68% 32%\nADB-Financing\nAll Categories          8.7          0.9          9.6 0.75          3.2 0.25\n100% 22%\nCivil Works          7.2          0.5          7.7 0.70          3.2 0.30\n66% 4%\nFX = foreign exchange; LC = local currency.\na   Discrepancies in subtotal values are attributed to round-off truncation.", "PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE\nDirector\nProject\nManager\nDesign & Executive 3\nAssistant 2\nProject Supervision Engineers Stores Unit\nConsultants (8)\nManager\nAssistant Assistant Assistant Assistant\nEngineer Engineer Engineer Engineer\nProject Office Drivers Junior Junior Junior\nAccountant Secretary (2) Engineers Engineers Engineers\n(3) (3) (3)\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n \n6", "IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\nAdvance \nProject Implementation Schedule\nRecruitment\nPosition\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nJ J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S ON D\nDesign and Supervision\nAdvance Recruitment\nDesign \nConstruction Supervision\nEquipment Procurement\nEquipment for the Mechanical Cell\nMaterial Testing Equipment\n3\n3\nCivil Works\nPrequalification, Bidding, \nEvaluation and Contract Award\nPeriodic Maintenance Contracts\nPackage 1\nPackage 2\nPackage 3\nPackage 4\nPackage 5\nPackage 6\nPackage 7\nPackage 8\nPackage 9 A\np\np\ne\nAdditional Slope Protection Works n\nd\nix\n \n7", "34\nAppendix 8\nPROPOSED PROCUREMENT PACKAGES\nBase Planned\nPackage Description Length Amount Procurement Completion\nNo. (km) ($ million) Method Date\nPM -1 Km 11 to Km 40 29.0 0.48 LCB Aug 2002\nPM-2 Km 40 to Km 94 54.0 1.48 LCB Sep 2004\nPM-3 Km 181 to Km 225 44.0 1.35 LCB Sep 2004\nPM-4 Km 225 to Km 257 32.0 0.91 LCB Jan 2003\nPM-5 Km 319 to Km 376 57.0 1.12 LCB Jan 2004\nPM-6 Km 376 to Km 427.7 43.7 1.34 LCB Jul 2004\nPM-7 Km 434.5 to Km 482.5 48.0 0.93 LCB Jan 2003\nPM-8 Km 482.5 to Km 525 42.5 0.65 LCB Oct 2002\nPM-9 Km 525 to Km 546 21.0 0.29 LCB Aug 2002\nSP-1,2 Additional Slope 0.68 LCB Mar 2004\nProtection Works\nEquipment\nE-1 Equipment for 0.40 IS Dec 2001\nMechanical Cell\nE-2 Laboratory Testing 0.04 DP May 2001\nEquipment\nConsulting Services 1.10 IR Oct 2004\nDP = direct purchase, IR = international recruitment, IS = international shopping; LCB = local competitive bidding.", "35\nAppendix 9, page 1\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE\nCONSULTING SERVICES FOR\nDESIGN, SUPERVISION, AND INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT\nA. Background\n1. Bhutan\u2019s road network is presently about 3,375 kilometers (km), of which 47 percent are\nclassified as national highways. The network is still relatively limited but adequate to serve the\ncountry\u2019s  economic  development  and  social  needs.  Therefore  the  policy  of  the  Royal\nGovernment  of  Bhutan  is  to  focus  on  maintaining  the  existing  road  network  rather  than\nexpanding it during the current Eighth Five-Year Plan.\n2. To support these objectives, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed technical\nassistance (TA)1 to help the Department of Roads (DOR) develop a sustainable road transport\nnetwork to provide access and economic development. This TA was carried out during 1999\nand, among other things, resulted in the preparation of a prioritized road network improvement\nprogram to facilitate the social and economic development of Bhutan.\nB. Objectives\n3. The primary objective of this ADB Project is to undertake a road improvement project\nthat will address the majority of the periodic maintenance needs on the Simtokha-Trashigang\nHighway (the East-West Highway). Another objective is to improve slope stability along portions\nof the East-West Highway as well as the Wangdue-Sarpang Highway and the Trongsa-Gelephu\nHighway. Approximately nine individual contract packages for resurfacing of the roadway are\nenvisaged,  with  about  half  to  be  prepared  on  a  fast-track  schedule  for  an  early  start  of\nconstruction activities. Smaller contract packages for slope stability improvement works on other\nsections of the roadway not receiving periodic maintenance will also be developed throughout\nthe project for less experienced or petty contractors.\n4. The Project includes consulting services and institutional support in specific areas where\nexisting capacities or resources are limited. It will involve (i) designing of periodic maintenance\ninterventions including patching, pavement strengthening or leveling course as required, surface\ntreatment,  minor  drainage  and  slope  protection  works;  (ii)  assisting  DOR  in  contractor\nprequalification,  preparation  of  bid  documents,  bid  evaluation,  contract  negotiations,  and\nsecuring necessary approvals, (iii) developing a slope stability program for DOR (para. 5); (iv)\nsupervising  the  periodic  maintenance  contracts;  (v)  assisting  DOR  in  procuring,  through\ninternational shopping, road construction and materials lab testing equipment; and (vi) training\nand building the capacity of DOR personnel in road maintenance and contract management. All\nthese activities will be coordinated through the project management office (PMO).\n5. Although the prime purpose of the Project is to improve the existing road pavement and\nassociated drainage, it is recognized that slope instability, road blockages and landslides are\nmajor  causes  of  traffic  disruption,  pavement  damage,  and  environmental  degradation.\nAccordingly,  some  slope  protection  will  be  required,  both  within  and  outside  the  identified\nperiodic maintenance contract packages. Due to cost constraints, only a limited portion of the\nslope instability affecting each periodic maintenance contract package will be addressed. The\nconsultant will be required to prioritize the individual sites, in consultation with the PMO, to\n                                                \n1  TA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.", "36\nAppendix 9, page 2\narrive  at  the  most  cost-effective  solution  overall.  The  consultant  will  also  assist  DOR  in\nintegrating  slope  stability  measures  into  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  operations\nnationwide.\nC. The Consultant\n6. The consultant must be an international consultant from a member country of ADB, who\nmay associate with other similarly eligible international consultants, and who is obliged to\nassociate with domestic consultants. An international consultant must lead the association.\nD.  Scope of Work\n7. The TA consultants produced samples of prequalification documents, bid documents\n(Instructions to Bidders, Conditions of Contract, Technical Specifications, specimen Bills of\nQuantities, Schedules of Supplementary Information, and appropriate forms), and bid evaluation\ndocuments based on the Government\u2019s Ministry of Finance Financial Manual, Chapter 17,\nupdated in July 1998. The documents are substantially based on standard Sample Bidding\nDocuments produced by ADB.\n8. The contract packages proposed by the TA consultants are in the table. These are\nindicative packages that may be modified according to the detailed design.\nPackage Kilometer Length\nNumber From To (km)\nPM-1a 11 40 29.0\nPM-2 40 94 54.0\nPM-3 181 225 44.0\nPM-4 a 225 257 32.0\nPM-5 319 376 57.0\nPM-6 376 427.7 43.7\nPM-7a 434.5 482.5 48.0\nPM-8a 482.5 525 42.5\nPM-9a 525 546 21.0\nTotal 371.2\na     Proposed fast-track packages.\n9. During detailed design of the contract packages, the consultants will\n(i)  evaluate  the  pavement  strength  including,  as  necessary,  Benkelman  beam\ndeflection  testing,  trial  pitting,  laboratory  testing  of  the  pavement  layers  and\nsubgrade  DCP  (dynamic  cone  penetrometer)  tests.  In  particular,  carry  out\npavement strength testing on a damaged road section at a high mountain pass\nsubject to freeze/thaw and determine appropriate remedial measures;\n(ii)  assess the requirement for localized patching, leveling; and reconstruction;\n(iii)  review  the  proposals  for  new  culverts  or  culvert  replacement/rehabilitation\n(including  erosion  protection  measures)  on  the  road  lengths  identified  for\nimprovements;", "37\nAppendix 9, page 3\n(iv)  check the condition and performance of the roadside drains and, where they\nrequire rehabilitation or upgrading, propose appropriate measures. Where road\nside drains are used for irrigation purposes, design appropriate structures to\npermit excess water to pass through the existing culverts;\n(v)  evaluate the requirement for slope protection measures adjacent to the road.\nWhere these are relatively minor (e.g., limited-height breast or retaining walls,\nslope trimming or bioengineering), prioritize individual locations in order of risk of\nblockage or damage to the road and draw up a schedule of protection measures\nfor each road section;\n(vi)  identify  appropriate  periodic  maintenance  and/or  slope  stability  contract\npackages within the competence of the less experienced contractors and attract\na good level of competition for the work;\n(vii)  assess the sources of natural construction materials (e.g., quarry sites), carry out\nsuitability tests, and prepare a materials report for the contractors\u2019 information;\n(viii)  locate suitable areas for disposing of surplus spoil;\n(ix)  assist DOR in determining what additional construction equipment should be\nprocured as part of the plant hire scheme;\n(x)  review  the  available  material  testing  equipment  and  recommend  additional\nmaterials lab testing equipment to be procured for use on the Project;\n(xi)  carry out the final design for resurfacing, roadside drainage improvement, and\nculvert  rehabilitation  or  replacement,  utilizing  pavement  courses  and  other\nconstruction methods within the capability of local contractors;\n(xii)  expedite detailed design of the fast-track packages, with an intent to award for\nconstruction approximately eight months after the start of the project;\n(xiii)  calculate quantities and analyze unit rates for all items of work to be carried out,\nprepare detailed estimates of construction costs for each road section;\n(xiv)  prepare  in  consultation  with  DOR  the  final  bid  documentation  for  periodic\nmaintenance  and  slope  stability  contract  packages.

Include  in  each  contract  package  a  provision  that\nsubcontracts a minimum 5 percent of the contract price to petty contractors.\nEnsure environmental mitigation measures conform to the requirements of the\nGovernment; and\n(xv)  prepare  a  project  prospectus  with  an  environmental  management  plan  for\nsubmission by DOR to the National Environment Commission, and respond to\nqueries from the Commission.", "38\nAppendix 9, page 4\n10. Prior to bid submission for the civil works contract packages, the consultants will\n(i)  review and confirm with DOR the proposed implementation program so as to bid\nthe fast-track periodic maintenance works as quickly as possible and maximize\ncontractor competition;\n(ii)  assist DOR with procurement of road construction and materials lab equipment in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement;\n(iii)  develop and agree with DOR on the contractor prequalification documents and\nscoring system and, after approval by ADB, issue them to interested contractors;\n(iv)  conduct  prequalification  workshops  to  explain  to  contractors  how  the  bid\ndocuments should be completed;\n(v)  evaluate  completed  prequalification  documents  and  recommend  contractor\nshortlists to DOR;\n(vi)  agree  on  a  bid  evaluation  scoring  system  for  both  experienced  and  less\nexperienced contractors and assist DOR with obtaining approval from ADB; and\n(vii)  issue approved bid documents to prequalified contractors, assist DOR in the pre-\nbid meetings, answer contractor queries, and issue bid addenda.\n11. Following submission of bids, the consultants will\n(i)  undertake bid clarifications with contractors, evaluate the bids, and recommend\nto DOR the award of contracts;\n(ii)  assist DOR in contract negotiations, preparation, and signing of final contract\ndocuments with successful bidders, and issuing Notices to Proceed; and\n(iii)  assist DOR in obtaining necessary approvals from ADB and other agencies.\n12.

Introduction\n1. This report summarizes the results of an initial environmental examination (IEE) of the\nproposed  Road  Improvement  Project  in  Bhutan.  The  Project  was  prepared  under  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA)1 between May and November 1999. The\nIEE was carried out in three stages: (i) fieldwork along the main highway network to observe\nenvironmental conditions and listen to the concerns of stakeholders; (ii) interaction with other\nmembers of the project design team to ensure that environmental constraints and opportunities\nwere fully reflected in the project proposals; and (iii) preparation of the IEE documentation (IEE\nand Summary IEE).\nB. Description of the Project\n2. Much of Bhutan\u2019s main highway network was constructed during the 1960s by the Indian\nBorder Roads Organization (IBRO). Investment in structures\u2014particularly retaining walls and\nside drainage\u2014has been insufficient and landslides frequently block the roads. Some stretches\nof the pavement are in very poor condition, and in many locations the base courses are showing\nsigns of failure. The Department of Roads (DOR) under the Ministry of Communications (MOC)\nis a relatively young organization, with inadequate resources for dealing with the demands of\nroutine, periodic, and emergency road maintenance.\n3. The road contracting industry is small scale and requires strengthening; and so does the\nconsulting engineering profession. Bhutan\u2019s engineers have few opportunities for continuing\nprofessional  development.  To  respond  to  these  challenges,  the  Project  has  two  major\ncomponents: road improvement program and road sector institutional strengthening program.2\nThe  road  improvement  works  will  concentrate  on  the  East-West  Highway    (Route  No.  1)\nbetween Simtokha near Thimphu and Trashigang (546 km). Other roads will be treated if funds\nare available.\n4. The periodic maintenance activities proposed in the Project fall into ADB\u2019s screening\ncategory B/C, projects judged to have some adverse environmental impacts, but of lesser\ndegree and/or significance than those for category A projects. For this category, an IEE is\nrequired  to  determine  whether  or  not  significant  environmental  impacts  warranting  an\nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) are likely. If an EIA is not needed, the IEE is regarded\nas  the  final  environmental  assessment  report.  Under  Bhutan\u2019s  environmental  screening\nprocess, this type of project falls into category C, impacts moderate, project repetitive. Project of\nthis category  does  not  require  further  environmental  assessment,  but  do  require  formal\nenvironmental  clearance  from  the  National  Environment  Commission  (NEC).  Impacts  of\ncategory C projects are best controlled through application of Codes of Practice.\n                                                \n1 TA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development Project, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.\n2  This Program will be carried out under TA 3470-BHU: Road Planning and Management Strengthening Project,\nfor $954,000, approved on 20 July 2000.", "47\nAppendix 11, page 2\nC. Description of the Environment\n1. Physical Environment\n5. The project roads are situated in a mountainous environment, with elevations ranging\nfrom 300 meters above sea level (m asl) in the Terai to about 3700 m asl at Thrumshingla.\nRegional climates vary from subtropical in the south through warm temperate to cool temperate.\nThe climate is monsoonal, with most rain falling between June and September. Annual totals\nmay exceed 5,000 millimeters (mm) at Sarpang and Galephu. In rain shadow areas and at\nhigher elevations, annual totals may be much less, down to 1,200 mm. In the front ranges,\nrainfall intensities can reach 600 mm/day, but again are much less at higher elevations and\ninterior  valleys.  In  winter  the  highest  passes  are  closed  by  snow.  The  region  is\ngeomorphologically active. Most slopes are only marginally stable, and landsliding is common.\nThe geology is mixed, with rock types varying from hard quartzite to soft mudstone.\n2. Ecological Resources\n6. Bhutan is a country of extreme biodiversity. Below the tree line (approx. 4,000 m), the\nvegetation is forest. Most of this is still intact, and so most of the project roads lie within\ntemperate or subtropical forested landscapes. Forest types crossed by the roads include fir,\nblue  pine,  mixed  conifer,  upland  hardwood,  lowland  hardwood,  chir  pine,  and  subtropical\nlowland. The forests offer a full range of ecosystem services, including wildlife habitat and\nwatershed protection, and are important economically (both commercially and for subsistence).\nMany medicinal plants are found in the forests, at all elevations. Bhutan retains an exceptional\nrange of wildlife that includes many endemic species. Many are nationally or internationally rare,\nendangered, or threatened. Flagship mammalian species utilizing the terrain crossed by the\nproject roads include red panda, Himalayan and sloth bear, tiger, elephant, and golden langur.\nThe temperate broadleaf forests are particularly important as habitat for birds, of which 770\nspecies have been identified to date. Birdlife International has listed Bhutan as a Priority 1\nEndemic Bird Area. Habitat degradation and loss, subsistence and commercial hunting, and\npoisoning have affected some wildlife populations. However, the prevailing Buddhist culture and\nlow population density combine to reduce the severity of the threats to wildlife, especially when\ncompared with that in other South and Southeast Asian states. The project road crosses one\nnational park and four proposed biodiversity corridors linking protected areas.\n3. Human and Economic Development\n7. Bhutan\u2019s population is approximately 600,000, of whom some 85 percent are rural and\ndepend on agriculture for a living. Population growth is reported to be 3.1 percent per year. The\nsettlements connected by the project roads are very small, with district centers housing a\nmaximum of a few thousand people. The communications infrastructure includes the road\nnetwork, now standing at about 3,375 kilometers (km), and a new national telecommunications\nsystem. There is no internal air service and no inland navigation. All other transport is on foot,\nby horse, mule, or yak.\n8. Industrial activities are very limited. The most important strategic industry is hydropower.\nThis is developing rapidly, with electricity sales to India seen as providing the bulk of state\nincome in future years. Two hydro projects are relevant to the project: (i) the ongoing Kurichhu\nProject, under construction by Indian contractors on the Kurichhu, some 7 km south of the East-", "48\nAppendix 11, page 3\nWest Highway; and the planned Mangdechhu Project, located on the Mangdechhu immediately\nbelow Trongsa town and Dzong, which will have access to India.\n9. Local administration is carried out through districts (Dzongkhag) and blocks (geog). At\nthe national level, environmental policy is developed and implemented by NEC. With ADB\nassistance,3 Bhutan recently established a formal process for environmental assessment of all\nmajor  projects.  The  new  system  includes  both  sectoral  guidelines  for  assessing  road  and\nhighway proposals and a code of practice for road construction and rehabilitation.\n4. Quality-of-Life Values\n10. The population of Bhutan is predominantly rural and poor. Health services are free.\nSerious  health  problems  include  respiratory  infections,  mother/child  mortality,  accidents\n(including traffic accidents), and vector-borne diseases such as malaria. An important constraint\non the provision of health care is physical access. Due to the remoteness of many settlements,\nit is often very difficult for patients to reach appropriate facilities. Bhutan has many important\ncultural heritage sites, archaeological, historical, and religious. The most spectacular are the\ndzongs, but the list also includes sites of battles and sacred natural features such as pools,\nmountains,  and  caves.  Information  on  such  sites  is  readily  obtained  from  local  residents.\nBhutan\u2019s  national  identity  centers  on  Buddhist  values.  In  environmental  terms,  the  most\nimportant is the interdependence of all life forms. Bhutan is a very important reservoir for\ntraditional ecological knowledge or IK (indigenous knowledge), particularly in relation to the use\nand properties of medicinal plants.\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Impacts due to Project Location\n11. The Project concerns road periodic maintenance and will not involve road widening,\nrealignment, or new construction. This aspect of the Project will not give rise to any significant\nimpacts. Small-scale construction camps, contractor\u2019s facilities, and quarries will be needed.\nSubject  to  appropriate  site-specific  planning  and  control  through  Environmental  Codes  of\nPractice, those structures will not give rise to unacceptable impacts. The project road passes\nthrough one national park and four proposed biodiversity corridors. Appropriate responses are\nto (i) ensure that wildlife is not harassed; (ii) consult with national park managers with respect to\nwildlife concerns, labor force management, etc.; (iii) coordinate with national park managers\nwith respect to road maintenance activities and scheduling; (iv) avoid quarrying within national\nparks; (v) avoid siting work or labor camps within national parks; and (vi) review siting of existing\nnational workforce camps.\n2. Impacts due to Project Design\n12. The Project is designed to carry out much-needed highway periodic maintenance and to\nimprove relevant domestic capacity. It will result in an overall reduction of environmental impact\ncompared with the without-project scenario, especially in relation to (i) siting and operation of\n                                                \n3  TA  2535\u2013BHU: Strengthening EIA Capabilities & Preparation of Environmental Guidelines, for $350,000,\napproved on 13 February 1996.", "49\nAppendix 11, page 4\nquarries, (ii) slope failure caused by inadequate drainage, and (iii) use of firewood for heating\nbitumen.\n3. Impacts during Construction\n(i)  Erosion and sedimentation. The Project will not involve earthworks.\n(ii)  Hydrology  and  Drainage.  The  Project  will  improve  road  drainage.  No\nsignificant impact from this activity is foreseen.\n(iii)  Paving and Firewood. A major part of the Project\u2019s physical works will be\npaving.  At  present  this  activity  uses  firewood.  The  Project  will  require\nnonwood  burning  technologies  for  heating  asphalt  in  all  dzongkhags\n(Thimphu, Wangdue-Phodrang, Mongar, and Trashigang).\n(iv)  Construction Materials. The Project will require appreciable quantities of\naggregates for paving works. Historically, stone has been collected from the\nroadside or from shallow workings, with significant negative impacts. Sand\nand gravel are obtained from rivers. Small aggregate may also be produced\nby hand. The Project provides an opportunity to improve the system for\nsupply  of  construction  materials  by  developing  district-level  plans,  and\npossibly centralized quarries.\n(v)  Traffic. It will not be possible to bypass the works, so providing continued\naccess for normal traffic will be a major element in construction planning.\nHazards could occur and should be minimized though appropriate signing,\nlighting, flagmen, etc. Construction traffic should be subject to standard\ncontrols on speed, vehicle loading, sheeting, etc.\n(vi)  Camps: The Project\u2019s construction camps could be foci for various health\nand  social  problems.  These  can  be  avoided  or  minimized  through\nconsultation  with  the  relevant  district  and  geog  officials,  and  camp\nmanagement.\n(vii)  Labor: Employment would be a major temporary benefit of the works.\n(viii)  Health and Safety. The Project provides an opportunity to improve safety\nand  working  conditions,  through  training  and  development  of  relevant\ncontractual conditions.\n4. Impacts during Road Operation\n(i)  Air quality. The Project will not affect Bhutan\u2019s excellent air quality.\n(ii)  Severance. Severance is not a problem along the project roads, and\npredicted traffic levels will not result in severance being a problem in any\nof the communities served by the road.", "50\nAppendix 11, page 5\n(iii)  Accidents. Improving the pavement is likely to result in higher vehicle\nspeeds. This may result in more accidents and increased severity of\naccidents.  A  particular  concern  is  the  hazard  to  roadside  residents,\nespecially children, from speeding through-traffic. Mitigation measures to\nconsider include engineering measures for differentiating between high-\nspeed rural areas and settlements, including speed bumps and rumble\nstrips; and incorporating safety measures in the design of the project,\nspecifically superelevation on bends when the pavement is reconstructed,\nguardrails, provision for pedestrians, and reflective roadside markings.\n(iv)  Fire. The project will not alter the situation with respect to roadside fires.\n(v)  Induced development. Roadside development is tightly controlled by the\ndistrict  administrations.  The  Project  will  not  contribute  to  uncontrolled\ndevelopment.\n(vi)  International  trade.  Road  improvements  to  be  carried  out  under  the\nProject are unlikely to have any measurable effect on international trade\nconsidering the unsustainable use of timber, wildlife, and other forest\nproducts.\n5. Impacts of the Environment on the Project\n13. The Project will be significantly affected by weather and by slope processes.\n(i)  Weather.  The  dominant  climatic  feature  in  Bhutan  is  the  monsoon.\nRoutine and periodic maintenance works during this time are difficult.\nActivities focus on emergency landslide clearance. It is important that no\nearthworks are carried out during the monsoon. Maintenance work at high\nelevations can be constrained by frost and snow.\n(ii)  Slopes.  The  roads  traverse  a  geomorphologically  active  landscape  in\nwhich landsliding are the rule rather than the exception. This has many\nimplications for road design, construction, and maintenance: slopes must\nbe treated with great respect, and disturbance to them minimized.\n6. Unlikely Impacts\n14. The following impacts are considered unlikely to occur in this road maintenance Project\n(i)  involuntary displacement due to land take for the works,\n(ii)  unwarranted alteration of traditional lifestyles,\n(iii)  increased direct access to unprotected ecologically valuable resources,\n(iv)  increased unsustainable or illegal use of natural resources,\n(v)  unmanageable immigration to the project area, and\n(vi)  unmanageable induced and/or roadside development.", "51\nAppendix 11, page 6\n7. Potential Enhancement Measures\n15. The Project provides an opportunity for major enhancement measures. From the point of\nview of continuous access, slope stabilization is the most important:\n(i)  Slope Stabilization. Pavement and drainage works are only part of the answer to\nensuring continued road operation. Additional and improved slope stabilization\nworks  are  required  in  many  areas.  Implementation  of  an  appropriate  slope-\nrelated program would maximize the effectiveness of the funds available to DOR.\nA 13-point action plan covering a range of slope stability issues, in order of\npriority, is presented in the Slope Stabilization Manual.4 In addition, it is strongly\nrecommended that DOR consider more extensive use of bioengineering.\n(ii)  Water  Management.  The  Project  offers  an  opportunity  to  assist  some\ncommunities  with  the  supply  of  irrigation  water,  and  to  solve  problems  of\nuncontrolled irrigation water disposal. The Project could assist both the Ministry\nof  Agriculture  and  DOR  to  install  dual-purpose  roadside  water  management\nstructures where needed.\n(iii)  Road Safety. As noted, the Project provides an opportunity to improve road\nsafety by incorporating various engineering measures in the program of works.\nE. Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring\n1. Institutional Capacity and Requirements\n16. At  present  DOR  has  limited  capacity  to  implement  and  enforce  the  environmental\nprovisions for road projects, which are emerging from Bhutan\u2019s new environmental assessment\nprocess.  Since  environment-friendly  techniques  are  central  to  low-cost  mountain  road\nengineering,  it  is  essential  that  DOR  increase  its  ability  to  design  and  implement  these\nmeasures.  The  Project  provides  an  opportunity  for  relevant  training  directed  at  road\nmaintenance operations. Such training will complement and amplify technical assistance being\nprovided to DOR relating to new feeder road construction (proposed United Nations Capital\nDevelopment  Fund  Feeder  Roads  Project  BHU/98/C02)  and  rural  access  (International\nDevelopment Association /SNV Rural Access Project).\n17. Environmental  aspects  of  road  maintenance  where  improved  techniques  will  be  of\nbenefit include paving, drainage, Construction Materials, slopes stabilization, earthworks, spoil\ndisposal,  snow  clearance,  safety,  consultation,  contract  documentation,  contractors,  and\nenforcement.\n2. Environmental Management\n18. The Project will incorporate a number of mitigation measures to minimize impacts on\nsensitive  receptors.  These  can  be  dealt  with  through  the  application  of  the  existing\nEnvironmental Code of Practice for the Road Sector.\n                                                \n4  The Slope Stabilization Manual was prepared under TA 3107-BHU.", "52\nAppendix 11, page 7\n3. Environmental Monitoring\n19. The  project  manager  in  DOR\u2019s  project  management  office  will  be  responsible  for\nmonitoring environmental compliance. At the field level, site engineers will carry out periodic\nmonitoring,  while  day-to-day  monitoring  is  the  contractors\u2019  responsibility  to  fulfill  the\nrequirements  established  in  the  contract  documents.  An  environmental  specialist  on  the\nconsulting services team for design, supervision, and institutional support will assist DOR with\nenvironmental monitoring.\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n1. Evaluation of IEE\n20. This IEE has identified (i) sensitive environmental receptors such as slopes, wildlife, and\nhabitat; (ii) important technological issues such as sourcing construction materials, and heating\nbitumen; (iii) mitigating measures in case of environmentally damaging activities included in the\nProject like earthworks; (iv) important enhancement opportunities such as slope stabilization,\nwater management, and health and safety; and (v) strengthening of environmental capability for\nthe key actors in road construction and maintenance, including project engineers, contractors,\nengineers, and domestic consultants.\n21. The authors of the IEE consider the effort involved sufficient to guide decision making on\nthis project.\n2. Further Environmental Work Required\n22. Further environmental work is required during project preparation: (i) incorporating the\nIEE recommendations in the Project\u2019s final design; and (ii) drafting a Project Prospectus for\nsubmission by DOR to NEC to obtain formal environmental clearance.\nG. Conclusions\n23. The IEE concludes that the Project, as proposed, does not require an environmental\nimpact  assessment.  The  road  improvement  activities  proposed  in  the  RIP  fall  into  NEC\u2019s\nscreening category\u2013C Impacts moderate, project repetitive. Projects in this category do not\nrequire further environmental assessment, but require formal environmental clearance from\nNEC. To receive domestic environmental clearance, DOR needs to develop and submit to NEC\na formal Project Prospectus. Impacts of category C projects are best controlled through Codes\nof Practice, in this case, through the existing Environmental Code of Practice for the Road\nSector, completed in 1999.", "53\nAppendix 12, page 1\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\nA. Analysis of Basic Data\n1. The  economic  evaluation  of  the  proposed  road  improvements  was  based  on  the\nfollowing  basic  data:  (i)  road  condition,  traffic,  and  axle-load  surveys;  (ii)  analysis  of  road\nimprovement costs; and (iii) review of vehicle operating costs (VOCs).\n1. Assessment of Road Condition\n2. A road roughness survey was carried out using a vehicle-mounted bump integrator and\ncounter to measure the unevenness of the road profile, and a calibrated odometer to measure\ndistance along the road.  The bump integrator produced roughness values and the equivalent\ninternational  roughness  index  (IRI)  for  all  sections  of  the  road  being  considered  for\nimprovement. Also, a road inventory and condition survey was conducted using a standard four-\nwheel drive pickup with a distance/speed sensor spliced to the vehicle speedometer cable. This\nequipment was interfaced with the ROMDAS software.  This allowed the location of inventory\nfeatures and their condition to be recorded.  Events were recorded on the computer keyboard\nas point events or continuous events.  Point events are those on or adjacent to the road such as\na culvert or a pothole. Continuous events are those that apply over a section of the road such as\ndrains or cracking. During the inventory and condition survey, exogenous interventions such as\nthe construction of new drainage structures and/or slope protection works were identified.\n3. Following  the  physical  surveys  on  the  project  roads,  homogeneous  sections  were\ndefined based on traffic volumes derived from the traffic analysis, roughness observed during\nthe surveys, and altitude and gradient of the roads. On inspection, the East-West Highway was\nsubdivided into 24 homogenous sections, the Sarpang-Wangdue Highway, 9 sections and the\nTrongsa-Gelephu Highway, 12 sections. The resultant homogeneous sections together with the\nengineering data were used in the Highway Design and Maintenance (HDM) analysis.\n2. Axle-Load Surveys\n4. To check on the loading characteristics of trucks, an axle-load survey was undertaken at\nLobesa, west of Wangdue.  In total 68 vehicles were weighed: 45 trucks of various sizes, 12\nbuses, and 11 other vehicles.  All lighter vehicles were discarded in assessing vehicle damage\nfactors.  In the case of trucks, 55 percent of the vehicles had gross vehicle weight (GVW) under\n12 tons and 45 percent above 12 tons. However, 70 percent of trucks had damage factors of\nequivalent standard axle (ESA) below 3.0 and 30 percent above 3.0.  Overall, the estimated\naverage damage factor for trucks was ESA 2.01. Buses were generally lighter, with all vehicles\nsurveyed being under 12 tons GVW. The calculated damage factor for all buses was below ESA\n0.5.  The estimated overall average ESA for buses was estimated 0.11. Estimated damage\nfactors for both trucks and buses compare reasonably well with default suggestions in the HDM\nmodel as well as with those in previous studies.  The estimates of ESAs for trucks and buses\nwere subsequently incorporated into the pavement deterioration analysis in HDM III.", "54\nAppendix 12, page 2\n3. Traffic Analysis and Projections\n5. For  analysis  purposes  traffic  volumes  for  three  types  of  motorized  vehicles  were\ndeveloped. The level of traffic on the project roads was determined by referring to recent\nDepartment of Roads (DOR) traffic count data.  This was compared with figures in recent\nstudies relating to the transport sector in Bhutan to check on the validity of the base information.\nTraffic on the project roads is subject to a range of influences, some of which are markedly\nseasonal. In particular, the extremely low temperatures in winter on the high mountain passes\nmake  the road difficult to drive on. During the monsoon season in June-September, many road\nsections become difficult to negotiate, which also reduces traffic levels. Seasonal factors were\napplied to the traffic counts and base year traffic was obtained. It is evident, Table A12.1 that\ntraffic is much higher in the west, toward Thimphu, than in the east.  Light vehicles predominate\nin the traffic mix, with trucks comprising the majority of the remainder.\nTable A12.1: Traffic on the East-West Highway (AADT)\nSection Light Bus Truck Total\nTrashigang \u2013 Mongar 33 1 35 69\nMongar \u2013 Jakar 28 1 23 52\nJakar \u2013 Trongsa 38 3 16 57\nTrongsa \u2013 Wangdue 100 3 64 167\nWangdue \u2013 Lobesa 184 9 86 279\nLobesa \u2013 Simtokha 323 21 131 475\nAADT \u2013 average annual daily traffic.\n6. For the forecast, two types of traffic are considered: normal and generated traffic. Since\nthe project road passes through a remote area and, currently, access to markets and urban\ncenters is hampered by the relatively poor condition of the road, it seems logical that if the roads\nare improved, some additional trips will be generated. The area of influence of the project roads\nis  concerned  mainly  with  pastoral  and  subsistence  farming  with  little  or  no  industrial\ndevelopment. In addition, the area has significant potential \u2013 but as yet unrealized - for tourism\ndevelopment. Diverted traffic1 has been excluded from the analysis.\n7. Predictions of generated traffic are difficult to make because they involve judgment\nbased on the expected response of road users to the reduced cost of road transport due to an\nimproved road.  It is only likely to be significant in those cases where the road investment brings\nabout substantial reductions in transport costs. To estimate the amount of generated traffic,2 a\ntransport elasticity of demand of unity was adopted for all vehicle types. This means that 1\npercent decrease in transport costs leads to 1 percent increase in traffic.\n8. In developing traffic forecasts, it was important to take full account of the analysis of\nexisting traffic demand, which showed the following principal features: (i) rapid growth of all\n                                                \n1  Diverted traffic is traffic that would switch from another route or mode of transport if the Project is implemented,\nwhile still traveling between the same origin and destination.  The East-West highway forms part of the main\ncorridor that links the country.  The main alternative route is to travel south to the border and subsequently\nthrough India. That option is unlikely.\n2  The United Kingdom\u2019s Transport Research Laboratory has undertaken extensive research in this area and the\nrecommended approach to forecasting generated traffic is to use demand relationships.  The price elasticity of\ndemand for transport measures the responsiveness of traffic to a change in transport costs following a road\ninvestment.  Evidence from a selection of countries indicates a range of -0.6 to -2.0 for the elasticity of demand\nfor transport, with an average of about -1.0.", "55\nAppendix 12, page 3\nmotorized traffic, 20 percent annual increase over the last five years; (ii) low car ownership,\n11/1,000 population with a growth of 21 percent annually since 1994; and (iii) dominance of the\nroad transport mode for both passengers and freight. Historic data did not seem to be consistent\nfor forecasting purposes.  Accordingly, it was decided to use factors based on experience in\nother developing countries, modified by evidence available in Bhutan. That experience shows\nthat, generally, freight traffic grows at a pace similar to that of the gross domestic project (GDP),\nan implied elasticity of 1.0, and passenger traffic grows rather faster with a typical elasticity of\naround 1.2. The elasticities adopted (Table A12.2) were disaggregated into three time periods:\n1999-2006, 2007-2012, and 2013-2021. Over time, the elasticities gradually decline as is shown\nby evidence from many countries.  If this were not the case, the proportion of the transport\nsector in relation to total GDP would continue to increase.  Since the share of transport as a\nproportion to total GDP rarely amounts to more than 10 percent this seems unlikely.\nTable A12.2: Transport Demand Elasticities\nPeriod Light Bus Truck\n1999-2006 1.8 1.8 1.5\n2007-2012 1.6 1.6 1.3\n2013-2021 1.4 1.4 1.0\n9. The forecast GDP growth rates were combined with the income elasticities of demand\nfor transport to give traffic growth projections for each vehicle type.  Annual traffic growth rates\nused for forecasts of future traffic and road user benefits were assumed to vary over time as\nfollows (Table A12.3):\nTable A12.3: Traffic Growth Rates (%)\nPeriod Light Bus Truck\n1999-2006 10.5 10.5 8.7\n2007-2012 7.2 7.2 5.9\n2013-2021 6.3 6.3 4.5\nB. Economic Evaluation\n1. Road Improvement Costs and Options\n10. The economic costs of implementing the Project were estimated from the financial costs\nof  civil  works,  physical  contingencies  and  supervision.  For  nontradable  items,  a  standard\nconversion factor (SCF) of 0.93 was used. The estimates included physical contingencies but\nexcluded  price  escalation,  price  contingencies,  and  interests  during  construction.  Financial\noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs were also adjusted by the same approach to obtain\neconomic  costs.  Incremental  O&M  costs  were  calculated  as  the  difference  between  O&M\nrequirement for the with- and without- project scenarios. Economic costs were estimated in\nconstant end-1999 prices. No salvage value was considered at the end of the project life cycle.\n                                                \n3  SCF based on the average level of direct taxation and the level of market distortion present in the economy.\nEvidence from recent studies, most notably the World Bank-financed Rural Access Project, estimates a SCF of\n0.9.", "56\nAppendix 12, page 4\n11. The cost estimates of the road improvement activities were derived from several sources\nincluding DOR, Bhutanese contractors, previous studies as well as experience within the region\nand elsewhere. The activities comprise the following:\n(i) Routine maintenance includes the cleaning of drains and culverts, removal of debris\nfrom the roadway including material deposited in the drains and roadway from minor\nslips,  cutting  of  vegetation  as  well  as  pothole  patching.  Each  of  these  activities  is\nassumed to occur throughout the year.\n(ii)  Periodic maintenance includes activities, that are required at regular intervals to restore\nthe road surface to the condition of the original construction. When performed in a timely\nmanner,  periodic  maintenance  activities  may  contribute  to  the  strengthening  of  the\npavement  structure,  thereby  accommodating  increased  levels  of  traffic.    Periodic\nmaintenance activities may include resealing such as surface treatment with sand or\nchip  seals  and  overlay  with  cold  or  hot  mix  asphalt.  The  periodic  maintenance\ninterventions selected for this study took into consideration local contractor and DOR\nexperience and engineering best practices. Several trial runs were made using the HDM,\nincluding the single surface treatment option, after which four options were selected:\noption 1, double surface treatment (DST) chip seal applied every 6 years; option 2, DST\nchip seal applied when roughness is IRI 6.5  meters per kilometer (m/km); option 3, 100\nmillimeters (mm) water-bound macadam (WBM) base course with DST; and option 4, 40\nmm hot mix asphalt-concrete (AC) overlay. Unit costs were derived for each option by\napplying current unit costs for labor, equipment, and material; productivity rates were\ndeveloped by the consultant and validated with DOR..\n(iii)  In addition to routine and periodic maintenance, capital works are required in certain\nareas  to  ensure  that  periodic  maintenance  interventions  achieve  or  exceed  their\nintended design life and reduction in VOCs achieve expected levels.  While in some\nareas these interventions may be quite extensive and could not be covered under the\nexisting loan, other areas require only relatively minor interventions.  The interventions\nare (i) reconstruction of destroyed pavement, (ii) slope protection, (iii) construction of\nnew culverts, (iv) repair of existing culverts, and (v) construction of lined drains.\n2. Least-Cost Improvement Options\n12. The preliminary results of the economic analysis indicated option 4 (40 mm hot mix AC\noverlay) would produce the highest returns on many sections of the project road, given the\ngreater  reduction  in  road  roughness  offered  by  this  alternative  than  by  the  DST  options.\nHowever,  implementing  option  4  will  involve  more  sophisticated  engineering  expertise  and\nnecessitate the use of expensive plant and equipment.  Given the relatively low development of\nthe contracting industry in Bhutan at present, it is doubtful if the AC overlay solutions would be\ntechnically feasible.  Furthermore, while option 4 generates greater benefits than alternative\nDST solutions, it also involves significantly greater cost. Given the circumstances, the economic\nanalysis  was  augmented  by  engineering  practicalities  that  indicate  the  most  appropriate\nrehabilitation option on each section of the East-West highway.  On the majority of the sections,\noption 1 (DST) was identified as adequate to improve the pavement to a satisfactory condition.\nOn certain sections in a particularly poor condition, however, option 3 (100 mm WBM + DST)\nwas deemed necessary.", "57\nAppendix 12, page 5\n3. Vehicle Operating Costs\n13. The VOC parameters for three vehicle types were developed using the World Bank\u2019s\nHDM model adjusted to local conditions. VOCs are influenced by vehicle speed, the horizontal\nand vertical alignment of the road, and the physical condition of the road surface in addition to\nvehicle type, price, age, and load.  The model utilizes the input data to calculate VOCs based on\nthe relationships originally prepared for the HDM III model of the World Bank.  Substantial input\ndata are provided as defaults of the model itself.  For this analysis, however, detailed local\ninformation was provided as much as possible to obtain results that are specific to Bhutan. The\ninput data was based on the end-1999 prices and is net of taxes, duties, and other charges. The\noutput of the model includes physical quantities of consumption and speed, and the associated\nVOC per predefined unit of 1,000 vehicle-km. VOC estimates for the three vehicles types and\nIRI values are shown in Table A12.4.\nTable A12.4: Vehicle Operating Costs for Different IRIs by Vehicle Type\n(Nu/km)\nIRI (m/km) Light Bus Truck\n2.0 4.9 7.8 9.4\n3.0 5.1 8.0 9.8\n4.0 5.3 8.3 10.2\n5.0 5.6 8.6 10.7\n6.0 6.0 9.0 11.3\n7.0 6.4 9.4 11.9\n8.0 7.0 9.8 12.7\n9.0 7.9 10.4 13.5\n10.0 9.0 11.0 14.5\n11.0 10.8 11.7 15.7\n4. Benefits\n14. The improvement of the East-West Highway will produce mainly road user benefits,\nwhich include savings in VOCs and time arising from the road rehabilitation.  For this analysis,\nroad  user  benefits  were  restricted  to  savings  in  VOCs  arising  from  changes  in  surface\nroughness.  Additionally,  since  transport  costs  are  relatively  high  and  improvements  offer\nsignificant  transport  cost  savings  that  will  stimulate  the  local  economy,  there  will  also  be\ndevelopment benefits such as increase in the quantity and quality of agricultural production in\nthe project area, tourism, and industrial development.  These benefits can be measured in terms\nof net value of generated output directly attributable to the road rehabilitation or in terms of the\ntransport cost benefits secured by generated traffic.4 However, it is essential that each approach\nbe pursued separately to avoid double counting. The present methodology concentrates on\nroad  user  benefits  and  adopts  the  approach  where  economic  development  benefits  are\nmeasured in terms of the benefits gained by generated traffic. The benefits from generated\ntraffic equal half of the product of the extra number of trips and the VOC saving per trip.\n                                                \n4  In Bhutan, freight rates are determined by the market and passenger fares are regulated but periodically\nreviewed. During the economic evaluation the estimated VOCs showed similarities with the rates and fares\nactually charged in the market. This increases the confidence that VOC savings would be passed on to the\nusers.", "58\nAppendix 12, page 6\n15.  Road improvements will change the nature and patterns of road maintenance compared\nwith continuance of the without- project scenario.  This has repercussions for the time stream of\nnet maintenance costs and there may be opportunities, depending on the nature of the initial\nintervention, for net savings in resource costs. The incidence of maintenance activities and\nsubsequent costs are determined by the HDM model. Savings (or costs) in these were also\nincluded in the analysis.5 Other quantifiable benefits such as travel time savings, cargo holding\ntime savings, and  reduced agricultural cargo spoilage were also studied, but not included in the\nevaluation. Nonquantifiable benefits such as social benefits and improved national integration\nare described in Appendix 13.\n5. Economic Rate of Return\n16. The economic evaluation of the Project compared the costs and benefits for the with-\nand without- project scenarios. Benefits based on VOC savings, in economic prices, were\ncalculated  for  normal  and  generated  traffic.  These  benefits  were  compared  with  the  road\nimprovement and maintenance costs to calculate the economic internal rate of return (EIRR).\nBenefit streams were calculated for a period of 20 years starting in 2001. Costs and benefits\nwere estimated net of duties and taxes, and are expressed in constant end-1999 prices (Table\nA12. 5.6 The base EIRR for the Project is 32 percent.\n17. The sensitivity of the EIRRs to changes in the underlying cost and benefit parameters\nwas analyzed. The results (Table A12.6) show that assuming a 15 percent increase in project\ncosts would decrease the EIRR to 27 percent.  If benefits only materialized to 85 percent of the\noriginal estimates, the EIRR would decrease to 27 percent. In a more adverse situation of a\nsimultaneous 15 per cent increase in project cost and 15 percent reduction of benefits the\noverall EIRR will be 22 percent.  The switching value7 for cost was determined to be 100\npercent, and switching value for benefits was 49 percent. If project implementation is delayed by\ntwo years, the EIRR will be reduced to 20 percent.  Also if only benefits due to VOC savings of\nnormal traffic are considered, the EIRR will decrease to 25 percent.\n                                                \n5  It is important to mention that a road for motor vehicles exists.  The economic and social cost of severance of the\nroad would be unacceptable. Therefore, the complete loss of motorized accessibility cannot be argued as being\na realistic without-the-project case.  Indeed, if it were, it would be possible to justify most infrastructure\ninvestments merely by failing to provide for their maintenance. However, it is clear that presently the project road\nis deteriorating over time.  With this in mind, it has been assumed that the project road in the without-the-project\ncase receives minimal maintenance, but with a cap in the IRI.  Furthermore, between 1999 and 2001, it is\nassumed only routine maintenance is undertaken on the project roads.  Following 2001, works are assumed to\ninclude both routine maintenance and patching (80 percent of potholes).\n6  As observed in Table A12.5 benefits from VOC savings diminish with time due to the natural deterioration of the\nroad.\n7  The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required\nfor the net present value (NPV) to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cutoff level of 12\npercent.", "59\nAppendix 12, page 7\nTable A12.5: Economic Cost and Benefit Streams\n(Nu.

Poverty Reduction and Social Assessment\n1. Background\n1.  The Government, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), prepared a\nstudy1 on poverty and a social assessment of the Project. The overall objective of the study was\nto assess (i) the poverty profile of beneficiaries; (ii) the groups who are expected to benefit from,\nand use services that are to be provided by the Project; (iii) the needs and demands of the\ngroups; (iv) their absorptive capacity; (v) gender issues; and (vi) possible adverse effects on\nvulnerable groups and the need for measures to mitigate such effects or compensate those\nadversely affected. The study was carried out in June-July 1999.\n2.  The main finding of the study was that the Project will lead to an improved standard of\nliving and reduced poverty and unemployment in its area of influence. This will be achieved by\nenhancing  household  mobility  and  expanding  economic  opportunities  in  the  project  area,\nparticularly in agriculture, cottage industry, and tourism. Special efforts were also made to\ninvolve  the  poor  by  providing  employment  in  the  process  of  construction  and  in  the\ninstitutionalized labor-based road maintenance, particularly for women through the Department\nof Roads\u2013national workforce.\n3.  Bhutan remained closed to the outside world until the 1960s when the third King opened\nlinks with other countries and initiated the development of Bhutan as a modern nation. Since\nBhutan  is  a  landlocked  country,  its  socioeconomic  development  depended  largely  on  the\nconstruction of roads. Bhutan now has a road network of about 3,375 kilometers (km), the main\nroutes being the East-West Highway and the four north-south highways. These connect almost\nall dzongkhags (districts) and a large proportion of the rural settlements. Establishing and\nmaintaining these roads have been a very difficult task because of the terrain and extreme\nvariations in climate: heavy snows in winter, and monsoon rains in summer.\n4.  A social assessment using participatory approaches and surveys in the project area was\ncarried out as part of project preparation. The study consisted of socioeconomic surveys (105\nhouseholds, about 1 percent coverage of total households in the project area), focus group\ndiscussions with key stakeholders such as Planning Commission and the Health and Education\nministries, Government officials in the district, social sector administrators of the nine districts in\nthe  project  area,  Road  Safety  and  Transport  Authority,  Bhutan    Development  Finance\nCorporation, and National Women Association of Bhutan. During the Fact-Finding Mission, a\nrapid rural appraisal was conducted for road workers and beneficiaries in several project areas\nto assess the potential employment opportunity as well as beneficiaries\u2019 needs and constraints.\nIn addition, an initial participatory workshop on improving the well-being of women road workers\nwas conducted with key stakeholders such as the private sector, aid agencies, civil society, and\ngovernment officials during the Appraisal Mission.\n2. The Project Area\n5.  The East-West Highway is the strategic road link allowing access across the country.\nWithout this road, access between the steep valleys of Bhutan would be only by horse and foot.\nThe only alternative route is to go south into India and back up into Bhutan. The road has\n                                                          \n1 TA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development Project, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.", "62\nAppendix 13, page 2\ntherefore  a  major  national  and  strategic  importance,  which  has  allowed  development\nopportunities into central and eastern Bhutan. It links the districts of Thimphu with Wangdue-\nPhodrang,  Trongsa,  Bumthang,  Mongar,  and  Trashigang  and  therefore  directly  affects  the\npopulations in those areas.\n6.  The Project will influence the economic and social development of much of the central\nregion of Bhutan, with direct impacts on 9 of the 20 districts. Beginning in Thimphu, the capital\ncity on the west, the road traverses hinterland areas of the Wangdue-Phodrang, and Trongsa\ndistricts, with access links to Bumthang, Mongar, and Trashigang districts in the east. By\nimproving the road condition and accessibility, the Project will indirectly influence all districts in\nthe country.\n3. Poverty Data Availability\n7.  The  late  start  in  planned  development  and,  hence  lack  of  trained  and  qualified\nmanpower, constrained the systematic surveys on the income and expenditure patterns of\nhouseholds in Bhutan. The limited surveys of land holdings and asset ownership, are not\nnationally representative. Bhutan has yet to institute a comprehensive national sample survey\nsystem that can collect, analyze, and report socioeconomic data periodically.\n4. National Human Development and Government Strategy\n8.  With an estimated gross national product (GNP) per capita of $586 in 1998, average\nBhutanese  incomes  are  low\u2013some  $1.30  per  head  per  day\u2013reflecting  widespread  income\npoverty.  However,  measuring  poverty  by  using  GNP  per  capita  often  gives  a  partial  and\ndistorted picture of human development. This is perhaps more true of Bhutan than of many\nother  countries.  A  large  part  of  Bhutan\u2019s  rural  economy,  which  is  predominantly  agrarian,\nremains nonmonetized, with barter systems still prevalent in many parts of the country. The\nGovernment recognized the multiple dimensions of poverty by measuring and targeting a range\nof health, education, and other standards regarded as fundamental to human well-being.\n9.  Indicators of human development showed that life expectancy in Bhutan had risen from\n48 years in 1984 to 66 years in 1998, which was three years more than the average for South\nAsia. The reported infant mortality rate was 71 per 1,000 live births in 1998. While that was\nconsiderably higher than Sri Lanka\u2019s 17 deaths per 1,000 live births, it was marginally lower\nthan  the  average  for  South  Asia.  Life  expectancy  figures  are  strongly  influenced  by  the\nprevailing levels of infant mortality. Many aspects of life are reflected in this one statistic\u2013the\ncapability of parents, prevalence of malnutrition and disease, availability of clean water, efficacy\nof health services, and, above all, the health and status of women. Furthermore, although the\nadult literacy rate had quadrupled in the past 20 years, that of Bhutan was 54 percent in 1998,\namong the lowest in the South Asia region. Based on these indicators above, the Human\nDevelopment Index in 1998 was estimated at 0.581 putting Bhutan in the category of medium\nhuman development countries along with Sri Lanka and the Maldives in South Asia.2\n10.  Bhutan  has  concentrated  on  supporting  socioeconomic  growth  to  ensure  universal\naccess to basic health, education, and essential social services. Thus, the abject poverty seen\nin some parts of Asia as a result of low incomes is not evident, as the Government\u2019s social\nwelfare policies over many years have resulted in high levels of human capital and relatively\nwidespread social well-being.\n                                                          \n2  Royal Government of Bhutan, Bhutan National Human Development Report 2000.", "Appendix 13, page 3\n63\n5.  Poverty and Socioeconomic Profile in the Project Area\n11.  According to the socioeconomic survey, 38 percent of the households are below the\nestimated poverty level of Bhutan.3 The survey shows that the poor are more likely to have\nlower education, have more children, have poorer house, lack of potable water, and have small\nland.\n12.  The total population in the Project area is 68,437 and 85 percent live in rural areas.\nAgriculture continues to be the main source of livelihood. Most of the people earn their living\nthrough farming, raising animals, and gathering forest products. About 90 percent are farmers\nwhile approximately 15 percent also engage in off-farm enterprises including retail activities,\nhandicraft, and food products.\n13.  Land holdings vary in size from zero for the few landless people to around 25 acres;\nhowever, the average holding for 65 percent of the people has is 2.0 acres.  From the focus\ngroup discussion conducted during the Fact-Finding Mission, size of land holding is not a\npredictor of income; depending on the mix of types of land, production and its value, the income\nderived from a plot will vary. Farmers with little land of their own will often sharecrop the land\nbelonging to others in return for half the crop so as to generate sufficient income.\n14.  Employment opportunities in rural Bhutan are restricted to work as a civil servant, a\nteacher, or a health worker in the basic health units in the villages or as a village headman.\nSome of the landless poor run small shops in the villages as one of their survival strategies.\nOccasional day labor is available for collecting and carrying firewood in some areas. During\nharvest and planting seasons, often there is labor shortage in rural areas. Farming households\ntend to help each other at times of greatest labor need and reciprocate to fill the gaps rather\nthan hire labor.\n15.  Other land-poor families join the Department of Road (DOR) national work force (NWF)\nin constructing and maintaining roads or working for the few private road contractors. The road\nworkers are among the neediest and poorest groups in the country. Illiteracy and insufficient\nland have forced them to leave their villages to join the workforce. They often are based in labor\ncamps along the road, with or without their families, and are solely there to maintain the road.\n6.  Gender and Poverty\n16.  Women in general are found to be more affected by poverty. This is largely due to the\ndiscrepancies that remain in important areas such as literacy and school enrolment particularly\nin  secondary  and  tertiary  education.  On  the  whole,  however,  Bhutanese  women  enjoy  a\nrelatively high status. For example, most women, inherit land, own livestock, and tend to play a\ncentral role in the family. Bhutanese law gives equal rights to women.\n17.  Agriculture sector is a major employer of women, as 85 percent of the Bhutanese people\nare entirely dependent on subsistence farming. Women play multiple roles in both productive\nand reproductive activities. For women working in agriculture, estimates and anecdotal evidence\n                                                          \n3  Since no documented information on the poverty line of Bhutan is available, its assessment was based on the\nsame yardstick (primarily daily calorie intake food of 2,200 calorie per person per day) as that followed in India,\nadjusted to consider nuances relevant to Bhutan, such as expenditure on transport, shelter, clothing, fuel, etc.\nThis is estimated to be around Nu504 per person per month or $144 per capita per year (December 1998 price\nlevel).", "64\nAppendix 13, page 4\nshow that their workload is higher than men\u2019s, largely because of their housekeeping and child\ncare responsibilities. In addition, the surveys indicate that 10 percent of the men have out-\nmigrated  to  join  traditional  religious  schools,  the  armed  forces,  and  other  services,  thus\nimposing an additional burden on women in terms of work and responsibilities. The most\ndisadvantaged women are those who live in low-income households. Illiterate women are often\ncut out of economic activities such as trading, and are a particularly vulnerable group.\nB.  Stakeholder-Based Assessment of the Importance of the Project\n18.  A stakeholder-based assessment was carried out as part of social assessment to gain\ninsights into the existing situation of stakeholders and to determine their expectation on the\nimpact of the Project. The assessment was undertaken in eight village clusters along the East-\nWest Highway and with other key stakeholders in Thimphu, through focus group discussions.\n1. Community Perception of the Importance of the Project\n19.  Community members expected the Project would lead to significant improvements in\nsocioeconomic conditions, with many existing constraints being reduced or overcome. The most\ncommonly cited impacts are as follows: (i) improved transportation would allow farmers to\ndiversify into higher value crops, such as fruit and green vegetables; (ii) reduced journey times\nwould increase tourist visits, and seasonal reductions in tourism would be moderate; and (iii)\nimproved access to market would lead to the expansion of cottage and small industries. It was\nexpected that such improvements would contribute to improvements in living standards and the\nquality of life.\n20.  There was widespread consensus that the poor standard of transportation contributed to\nthe existing lack of employment opportunities and access to health, education, and other social\nservices, and that the Project would help improve economic prospects, living conditions and the\nquality of life. Examples of why stakeholders are looking forward to the project are sited here.\n21.  Road Users (passengers and drivers of motor vehicles). The main impact of the\nProject will be shorter travel time, reduced delays, higher travel speeds, increased comfort, and\nreduced vehicle operating costs (VOCs), which may translate into increased service frequency\nand lower fares.\n22.  Access to Markets. Timely access to markets, particularly during rainy season, is vital\nto the survival of the majority of households served by the East-West Highway. Cash crop sales\nare the major source of income in almost all rural households, supplemented by sale of woven\nhandicrafts where the skills exist in the household. Loss of income from crops will lead the\nhousehold to poverty unless other sources are available.\n23.  Labor Force Participation and Employment Opportunity. Communities along the\nEast-West Highway expect that the Project will lead to investment in new industries and service\nactivities offering more attractive sources of employment. With improved access to markets,\nthey  expect  to  have  better  opportunities  for  operating  their  own  small  and  medium-scale\nenterprises. Moreover, the Project will create employment opportunity for the road workers, road\nsupervisors, engineers, and petty road contractors.\n24.  Farmers  and  Agricultural  Producers.  Improvements  in  transportation  will  facilitate\naccess by rural people to markets in urban centers, and sellers of garden fruit and vegetables\nwill have more ready access to the markets. This is especially important for sellers of potatoes", "65\nAppendix 13, page 5\nwhere delay in delivery can result in the crop loss. The seasonal nature of potato sales means\nthat loss of the crop will ruin the household financially. Furthermore, road improvements mean\nthat  Druk  Seeds  could  expand  its  marketing  activities  out  of  its  district  headquarters  in\nBumthang. This would provide farmers greater security of income, and reduce the risk and\nefforts required\u2013at present, to hire trucks to carry the crop to Phuentsholing themselves\u2013and\nenable them to sell to the Indian export market.\n25.  Extension  Workers.  Improved  access  will  increase  the  effectiveness  of  extension\nworkers in reaching communities and promoting improved technologies and inputs. This will\nhave a direct impact on rural production and income. Currently there are agricultural and\nforestry extension workers based in the community along the East-West Highway.\n26.  Health  Services.  Improved  access  can  mean  increased  use  of  health  and  family\nplanning services. Health services are also better when access is easier. Road improvements\nwill facilitate movement of staff to the outreach clinics from the basic health units, permit timely\ndelivery  of  medical  supplies,  and  facilitate  access  to  the  services,  particularly  in  case  of\nemergencies. One of the most frequently mentioned concerns of rural villages was the difficulty\nof accessing emergency care, especially in the monsoon period when landslides frequently\noccur.\n27.  Educational Facilities. The main restraint to the expanded provision of education is\nlack of trained teachers. Teachers, particularly women, are reluctant to accept postings in\nremote areas where access is difficult or transport services are minimum and/or expensive.\nParents are reluctant to send children to school where the travel time is prolonged. The Project\nwill reduce travel times and costs for teachers and pupils, and contribute to the expansion and\ntake-up of education services in the project areas.\n28.  Tourism. Improved roads will lead to an expansion of tourism with both foreigners and\nBhutanese  visitors.  Bumthang,  one  of  the  main  religious  places  of  the  country  receives\nnumerous pilgrims and other visitors. Better access will lead to an increase in visitors and\nexpansion of related-service industries. Similarly, many Bhutanese travel to India in winter to\nundertake pilgrimages in Bihar. Over 80 percent of religious pilgrims are from rural areas.\nImproved access along the East-West Highway will enable more people to travel more easily for\nthese purposes.\n29.  Social Benefits. Improvements to the transportation system and network have social\nbenefits for families. Communications between families will be easier and they will be able to\nvisit each other more easily and more frequently. These are important benefits when people are\nposted all over the country for work, to attend schools and colleges, and where marriages often\noccur between people from different districts.\n2. Business Community Perception\n30.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  focus  group  discussions  to  assess  the  general\nperception of the business community in Thimphu and Wangdue-Phodrang on how the Project\nwould benefit private sector activities indicated strong support for the project. In general, the\nprivate sector expects the Project to significantly improve the attractiveness of the east region\nfor business and private investment, and contribute to more rapid economic growth. The East-\nWest  Highway  will  enable  companies  to  make  use  of  the  region\u2019s  abundant  agricultural\nproducts, natural resources, and tourism opportunities, as well as the proximity to India. Until\nnow, these advantages have been outweighed by lack of an efficient transport network.", "66\nAppendix 13, page 6\n31.  Lack of an efficient long-distance transport has been a major constraint on private\nenterprise development in the east region. It was a source of multiple, mutually reinforcing\ndisadvantages. Businesses whose inputs and/or outputs were perishable faced unacceptable\nlevels of spoilage and could not attract premium prices. Lack of reliable transportation precluded\ncertain types of agricultural products that were subject to strict delivery schedules. The business\ncommunity expects the Project to significantly reduce these constraints.\n32.  The business community claims improved transportation will help increase the scale and\nraise the profitability of private activities. Businesses will gain access to better priced domestic\nand export markets, enjoy reduced input costs, and be able to improve productivity. Among the\nmain areas of private sector activities that will benefit are agriculture, tourism, cottage and small\nindustries, and supporting services. The private sector believes the Project will contribute to\nattracting domestic and foreign investment and international tourism, not only in the project area\nbut also throughout Bhutan.\n3.  Perception of a No\u2013Project Scenario\n33.  Focus group discussions with key stakeholders such as government staff, business\ncommunity, and direct beneficiaries indicate that none of the positive benefits would occur if the\nworks did not take place. Two main reasons are mentioned: (i) Income generation would not\nincrease if the road quality declines. Increased transport delay would cause rural incomes to\ndecline. For the majority of farm households in the project area, this would lead to a significant\nincrease in poverty. (ii) Increased difficulty of travel would increase reliance on the routes via\nIndia, which will increase transportation transportation.\n34.  The summary of beneficiary assessments of the with- and without-project scenarios are\nas follows.", "67\nAppendix 13, page 7\nTable A13: Beneficiary Perception of the Project\nConsultation\nType of Beneficiary With Project Without Project Method\n1.

Under ADB\u2019s current project classification system, the Project\u2019s primary objective is\neconomic growth and the secondary objective, poverty reduction as it targets poorer areas of\nthe country. Under the new project classification effective 2001, the Project would be classified\nas pro-poor growth. The Project will approach poverty reduction in at least three ways: (i) pro-\npoor growth, (ii) improved quality of life, and (iii) employment opportunities for the poorest\npopulation of the country.\n1.  Pro-Poor Growth\n36.  More  rapid  economic  development  is  expected  to  significantly  reduce  in  poverty\nhinterland  and  eastern  regions.  Existing  poverty  is  rooted  in  lack  of  economic  activities,\nsufficient  employment  opportunities,  and  livelihood  activities.  Survey  data  on  occupational\ndistribution suggests that many of the poor in the project area are engaged casual labor; or work", "69\nAppendix 13, page 9\nin  agriculture,  cottage  industries,  and  construction;  or  are  unemployed.  The  expected\ndiversification of agriculture and expansion of potentially better paying employment in small\nindustries and tourism are likely to have especially significant poverty reduction impacts.\n37.  For farmers in general, the improved transport network can also ease the introduction of\nmodern farming practices and the transition from subsistence farming to cash crops and a\nmarket economy. Better and reliable access can also lower the costs of inputs such as fertilizer\nand stimulate higher cash crop farming production and more stable incomes, enabling the poor\nto improve their management of risks. The Project will benefit the urban population as well. For\nexample, a reduction in food prices for the urban poor can be achieved.\n2. Improved Quality of Life\n38.  The  Project  will  have  direct  impacts  on  the  quality  of  life  of  all  income  groups.\nImprovements on the East-West Highway not only provide people with more convenient access\nto a broad range of socioeconomic opportunities, but also have a strong income effect by\nlowering transport costs and hence the prices of consumer goods and services. Therefore, it will\ncontribute to improving personal welfare. Moreover, lack of affordable access deprives the poor\nof opportunity to take advantage of jobs and even of very basic social services. Reliable access\nto schools and health services will enable the poor to accumulate human capital, which is a key\nfactor in sustainable poverty reduction.\n3.  Employment Opportunities for the Poor\n39.  The Project will generate a demand for labor (often unskilled labor) and provide income-\nearning opportunities for the poor. It will enable the privatized road contractors to provide\nemployment  opportunities  for  the  local  community.  This  could  be  of  particular  value  to\nhouseholds with very small plots and/or few animals and who have to sharecrop other farmers\u2019\nland, or who have time available. Since the Project will generate jobs for the poor who are\notherwise unemployed or underemployed, it will contribute to poverty reduction.\n40.  The Project will also directly benefit the road workers. In the project area are 2,748 road\nworkers\u201340 percent are women\u2013who are paid by DOR. They are among the neediest and\npoorest groups in the country. Their average salary is Nu1,500 per month and their families live\nwith them. On the average, each family has four children. The Project will be implemented by\nthe private contractors, which will hire the bulk of the road workers. Private firms pay their road\nlaborers an average Nu2,700 per month, which is Nu1,200 higher than the DOR rates and will\ndefinitely decrease poverty among the road workers.\nD. Gender Impact\n41.  The  Project  will  have  no  negative  impact  on  gender  relations.  Women  will  benefit\nthrough  their  participation  in  roadwork  opportunities,  mainly  drainage  and  slope  protection\nactivities. Since women in Bhutan are active producers and marketers of food, reducing the\ntransport impediments of rural women would release their time and energy for more productive\nand socially beneficial activities. The Project will facilitate access to existing health, social\nservices, and schools; enable teachers, of whom the majority are women, to commute from\nurban centers to village schools; and permit district administrators to establish new schools and\nrecruit more teachers. The enrollment rates will increase for both boys and girls, but the rate for\ngirls, which has been much lower than for boys might increase more.", "70\nAppendix 13, page 10\nE. Local Labor\n42.  For road improvements, the Government will encourage private contractors to employ\nlocal labor instead of imported labor from India and Nepal. This will be closely monitored during\nsupervision, with attention to the specific contractual clauses incorporated in the sample bidding\ndocuments. Any negative impact on groups and individuals will be identified and mitigated. For\nexample, the use of child labor in construction activities is not allowed. Close monitoring during\nsupervision will pay attention to the specific contractual clauses incorporated in the sample\nbidding documents.\nF. Participatory Approach\n43.  The  participatory  approach  was  used  during  the  project  preparatory  technical\nassistance, Fact-Finding and Appraisal Missions to understand poverty from the perspective of\na range of stakeholders, particularly poor women and men, and to involve them in the planning\nfor follow-up action. The social assessment aims to inform the affected people about the Project\nand its implications, and elicit their suggestions, views on mitigation measures, and the role they\ncould play. The local community, particularly the poor, will be informed and encouraged to\nparticipate in road improvement and maintenance activities where their participation will be\nmaximized.\n44.  A  participatory  gender  assessment  of  the  well-being  of  women  road  workers  was\nconducted.4  A  survey  was  carried  out  along  the  East-West  Highway.  Direct  generation  of\nprimary data through participatory gender assessment and survey will produce the baseline\ninformation to determine gender ratio, working conditions, effectiveness of the World Food\nProgram, social and welfare facilities available, and the constraints and opportunities to improve\ntheir working conditions and livelihood. The analysis of policies on labor and the national\nworkforce, and other secondary data will supplement this participatory assessment. An initial\nstakeholder  survey  was  conducted  during  Appraisal  Mission  aimed  at  increasing  key\nstakeholders\u2019 awareness of the importance of improving the well-being of road workers and\nassessing stakeholders input on issues that need to be addressed during the assessment.\nG. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n45.  The Project does not involve any land acquisition or resettlement, as the works to be\nundertaken will be confined to resurfacing within the existing right-of-way. The Ministry of Home\nAffairs Rules and Regulations state that no one is permitted to construct or erect or install any\nkind of house, fences within 50 feet on either side of the road. The walkover survey along the\nEast-West Highway found that there are no squatters within the right-of-way. Since there will be\nno land acquisition and resettlement in this Project, a land acquisition and resettlement plan is\nnot needed.\n                                                          \n4 Under TA 5889-REG: Gender and Development Initiatives, for $850,000, approved on 13 December 1999", "71\nAppendix 13, page 11\nH. Impact on Indigenous People and Cultural Properties\n46. Data from the social assessment and other available documents show no separate\ndisadvantaged groups who are likely to be adversely affected by the Project. Accordingly, there\nis  no  need  to  prepare  an  indigenous  people  development  plan.  Also,  the  Project  will  not\nadversely affect any cultural property. In fact, the Project will facilitate access to some of the\nhighly revered spiritual centers in Bhutan.\nI. Project Performance Monitoring System (PPMS)\n47. During project implementation, DOR, with the assistance of the consultants, will carry\nout project performance monitoring system (PPMS) activities under arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB to ensure efficient management of project activities and maximization of project benefits.\nThe  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  performance  indicators  (Appendix  10)  for\ncarrying out these PPMS activities. The findings and supporting data will be incorporated into\nthe project performance monitoring and evaluation report for the completed Project. Community-\nbased organizations in the geog,5 in association with the DOR, will verify the effectiveness of\nproject activities and outputs, as well as the reactions of the intended beneficiaries. A sociologist\non the consulting team will assist DOR with that task. The project performance and monitoring\nevaluation will allow postevaluation of the Project, and also improve planning for future road\nimprovement projects.\n                                                          \n5  A geog is a cluster of villages."], "metadata": {"Author": "ldm", "CreationDate": "D:20000918190418Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131112164804+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R185-00RRP.doc"}}
