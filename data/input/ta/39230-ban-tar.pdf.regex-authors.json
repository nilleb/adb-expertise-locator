The urban poor in particular have limited access to basic infrastructure such as \nhousing, low-cost sanitation, clean drinking water, adequate sewerage systems, and solid waste \nmanagement.  Implementation  of  urban  infrastructure  under  past  and  ongoing  projects  has \nindicated  that  good  urban  governance1 and  effective  management  are  prerequisites  for \nproviding adequate access to urban infrastructure services. Decision-making power to improve \nmunicipal  service  should  be  based  on  participation  processes  through  which  the  diverse \ninterests of city residents may be accommodated and cooperative action can be taken. \n \n2.  Technical assistance for Participation of the Urban Poor in Municipal Governance (TA) \nwill support the Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project2 (UGIIP), \nwhich  is  designed  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  urban  development  and  services  in  22 \nmunicipalities  and  to  strengthen  urban  governance  by  enhancing  the  participation  and \ninvolvement of the urban poor in urban governance. The TA concept was endorsed for funding \nby the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund in March 2005, and the concept paper received \nADB concept clearance on 21 March 2005. ADB staff undertook the Fact-Finding Mission in \nMay 2005 to clarify the scope and purpose of TA. The TA Preparation Mission was fielded  \n25\u201329 September 20053 and reached agreement with the Government on project components, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  a  timeframe  for  implementing  the  TA.  The  impact, \noutcomes,  and  outputs  of  TA  are  summarized  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework \n(Appendix 1).4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Bangladesh has been experiencing rapid urbanization since the mid-1970s. Between \n1975 and 2002, the percentage of the total population in Bangladesh living in urban areas rose \nfrom  10%  to  24%.  Despite  the  recent  decline  in  overall  population  growth,  rural-to-urban \nmigration has sustained high urban population growth. The urban growth rate currently stands \nat 5\u20136% per annum,5 almost twice that of rural areas. If trends continue, more than half of the \npopulation of Bangladesh will be urban by the year 2030.6 Around 37% of the urban population \nlived below the poverty line in 2000. Even though the percentage of urban poor has decreased \nover the last decade, the same period has seen a 40% rise in the absolute number of urban \npoor. \n \n4.  Urban poverty is associated with poor-quality housing often located in overcrowded, \nunsanitary  slum  settlements  without  such  environmental  services  as  water  supply,  drain \n                                                 \n1  Good urban governance is defined as political, economic, and administrative authority in the management of a \ncountry\u2019s affairs at all levels. It comprises the mechanisms, processes and institutions through which citizens and \ngroups articulate their interests, exercise their legal rights, meet their obligations, and mediate their differences. \nGovernance as a concept recognizes that power exists inside and outside the formal authority and institutions of \ngovernment, and it emphasizes that decisions are made based on complex relationships between many actors with \ndifferent priorities.

Poor health is common due to the spread of infectious \ndiseases. Slum dwellers are constantly under the threat of exposure to environmental hazards \nsuch as mosquito-infested drains, fires, and floods. Despite inadequate urban facilities and poor \nliving conditions in slum areas, poor people continue to move from rural to urban areas in the \nhope of better economic opportunities.    \n \n5.  While the implementation of urban physical works under past and ongoing projects has \nbeen satisfactory, progress in institutional reforms, an integral part of all urban projects, has \nbeen  much  slower  than  originally  anticipated.  In  fact,  the  slow  progress  made  on  urban \ninstitutional reforms is a reflection of poor urban governance and the lack of accountability on \nthe  part  of  participating  municipalities  in  urban  management.  Past  experience  shows  that \nphysical  infrastructure  improvements  cannot  be  sustained  unless  persistent  governance \nproblems are addressed.  \n \n6.   The major focus of the UGIIP is to implement an Urban Governance Improvement \nAction Program in selected municipalities. Overall, the UGIIP comprises five subprograms: three \nfor enhancing the awareness and participation of local stakeholders in urban planning and \nmanagement (citizen awareness and participation, women\u2019s participation, and the integration of \nthe  urban  poor),  and  two  for  improving  accountability  and  transparency.  Under  these \nsubprograms, municipalities will form town-level coordination committees (TLCCs) and ward \ncommittees, implement poverty-reduction action programs, operate micro-credit programs for \npoor women, and increase tax collection. \n \n7.  During the TA Fact-Finding Mission and the TA Preparation Mission, ongoing activities \nof the UGIIP were reviewed and it was noted that  \n(i)   Representation of the poor in TLCCs and ward committees does not necessarily \nenable  the  poor  to  participate  actively  in  decision-making  processes  in  the \ncommittees. \n(ii)   Under the UGIIP, municipalities are supposed to develop municipal development \nplans and urban master plans, which will require significant skills on the part of \nTLCC members and municipal officials in participatory and pro-poor planning. \n(iii)   The poverty reduction action plans and slum-upgrading programs of the UGIIP \nwill only include 21,000 households from 22 municipalities. Field observations \nsuggest that the number of poor households is much higher.7  \n \nTherefore the UGIIP offers little scope to ensure wider participation in providing input to the \npreparation  of  municipal  development  and  urban  master  plans,  or  in  mobilizing  municipal \nservices.  \n \n8.  Improvements in urban services for the poor will require joint planning, implementation, \nmonitoring, and maintenance of urban services among the various urban groups including the \nurban poor, municipal officials, and elected representatives of the municipality. Given limited \nparticipation,  especially  among  the  urban  poor,  in  urban  governance,  more  efforts  will  be \nrequired to empower the poor to participate effectively in decision-making processes and to \nincrease the capacity of municipal governance to implement pro-poor participatory planning and \nmanagement approaches to urban service delivery. \n \n                                                 \n7  This was confirmed during the Fact-Finding Mission, which indicated that Tongi and Naranyangang alone have \napproximately 20,000 poor households.  \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be the enhanced capacities of the urban poor in selected \nmunicipalities to access high-quality urban services. The outcomes of the TA will be (i) the \nestablishment of an institutional mechanism increasing access for the poor to decision-making \nprocesses in municipalities and (ii) participatory pro-poor planning and monitoring systems \nbeing developed and adopted in selected municipalities.      \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Based on the activities being implemented under the UGIIP, the TA will have four \noutputs or components. The components address major constraints to improving municipal \nservices for the poor and comprise (i) social mobilization and capacity development of urban \npoor; (ii) capacity development in participatory and pro-poor planning for TLCCs and ward \ncommittee members and municipal officials; (iii) establishment of municipal forums of urban \npoor, municipal officials, and elected representatives; and (iv) a workshop, a study tour, and \nstudies. TA will be implemented in 15 secondary towns under the UGIIP.  \n \n11.  Component 1: Mobilization and Capacity Development of the Urban Poor. The TA \nwill mobilize urban poor outside the selected slum areas under the UGIIP but within 15 of the 22 \nmunicipalities in which the UGIIP is implemented. Urban poor from slum settlements outside the \nUGIIP (at least 30% of them women) will participate in training. The purpose of the training is to \nprovide slum dwellers with specific skills, knowledge, and information to articulate their needs in \nTLCCs, ward committees, and municipal forums, and to participate actively in urban planning. \nThe training includes (i) the roles and functions of municipalities; (ii) citizens\u2019 responsibilities; (iii) \nthe  municipality  budget  and  its  allocation;  (iv)  information  on  government  development \nprograms and nongovernment organization (NGO) programs; (v) resource mobilization; (vi) pro-\npoor participatory planning and budgeting; (vii) participatory monitoring and evaluation; and (viii) \nmaintenance of municipal services. \n \n12.  Component  2:  Participatory  Pro-Poor  Planning  and  Management.  The  TA  will \ndevelop a comprehensive training and capacity-development program for members of TLCCs \nand  ward  committees,  members  of  town  planning  units,  and  elected  representatives  of \nmunicipalities, including ward commissioners and municipal officials (at least 30% of whom shall \nbe women) to conduct participatory pro-poor planning, budgeting, and monitoring of municipal \nservices.  The  capacity  development  will  include  (i)  a  review  of  rules  and  procedures  for \nparticipatory planning and (ii) the adoption of new techniques for pro-poor planning and a \ntargeting mechanism for better municipal services for the poor. Pilot testing of citizens\u2019 report-\ncards8 will be tested in five municipalities. The purpose of the training is to provide participants \nwith specific knowledge and information to function as members of the various bodies. Training \nwill include (i) the roles and responsibilities of respective stakeholders and TLCC members in \nimproving municipal governance and (ii) grassroots participatory planning and monitoring of \nmunicipal  services.  Female  ward  commissioners  in  the  selected  municipalities  who  are \nmembers of TLCCs and ward committees will be selected as champions to ensure the political \naspects  of  ownership  and  capacity  development.  TA  will  work  closely  with  the  mass \ncommunication cells established under the UGIIP and develop a program of dissemination for \nparticipatory poor-poor planning and monitoring.  \n \n13.  Component 3: Organization of Municipality Level Forums. Municipality forums will \nprovide authority for the urban poor to participate effectively in planning and monitoring urban \ninfrastructure services. The forums will increase the knowledge and responsibility of the urban \n                                                 \n8  Citizens\u2019 report cards indicate the access to, cost, and quality of services available to the citizens.  \n ", "4   \npoor in regard to service delivery. The forums will bring together elected officials, line officers of \nthe municipal government, and representatives of the urban poor to discuss local needs and \npossible ways to mobilize government resources to meet those needs. The access enjoyed by \nthe  urban  poor  to  information  about  municipalities\u2019  existing  and  planned  service  delivery \nschemes will increase the accountability of ward commissioners and municipality officials. The \nforums will facilitate community participation in specific project operations and maintenance \nactivities. To facilitate the sustainability of the municipal forums, a network will be established to \nlink municipal forums one to another.    \n \n14.  Component  4.  Studies,  Workshop,  and  Study  Tour.  Case  studies,  including  a \nsynthesis report, will be prepared identifying best practices for participatory pro-poor planning \nand monitoring in urban infrastructure service delivery. The synthesis report will identify, among \nother things, a framework for the participation of urban poor in municipal governance and an \naction plan for institutionalizing the framework in municipalities. A national workshop will be \nconducted to disseminate TA activities and findings, identify issues related to participatory pro-\npoor planning, and discuss policy recommendations for pro-poor municipal governance. A study \ntour for selected representatives of the municipality forums will be conducted to another country \nin South or Southeast Asia to share good practices regarding the participation of the urban poor \nin  urban  governance.  The  study  tour  will  broaden  the  participants\u2019  vision,  enhance  their \nunderstanding, and enable them to be more innovative regarding their policies and programs in \ntheir home country. The selection of the study tour destination, as well as criteria for selecting \nparticipants, shall be approved by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and \nADB before the program is finalized.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. ADB will fund $480,000. The \nTA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The fund will be used for financing an international consultant and NGO \ncontracts to include preparing training materials, delivering training, and implementing field \nactivities. The Government of Bangladesh will provide $120,000 equivalent primarily through in-\nkind contributions to cover accommodation for the international consultant, venues for meetings \nand  workshops,  transport,  counterpart  staff  support,  and  monitoring  of  TA  activities.  The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Executing Agency for TA will be LGED under the Local Government Division (LGD) \nof the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives. A TA steering \ncommittee will be established in LGD and chaired by the joint secretary (development) of LGD. \nThe members of the committee will be representatives from LGD; LGED; Planning Commission \nand  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  under  the  Ministry  of  Planning; \nEconomic Relations Division; Finance Division of Ministry of Finance; National Institute for Local \nGovernment; Department of Public Health Engineering; Ministry of Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s \nAffairs; and representatives of municipalities.  \n \n17.  The TA design is based on an innovate approach and the TA will focus directly on local \nurban communities, which makes it more suitable to engage a NGO (lead NGO) to implement \nthe TA activities. This lead NGO shall be selected in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and in line with quality-based \nselection procedures, rather than with the quality- and cost-based selection method. This is \nbecause the exact tasks of the lead NGO will be based on the specific needs of urban poor, \nmaking it impossible for the lead NGO to provide detailed terms of reference and submit the \ndetailed financial proposals that are required by the latter method. The lead NGO will select and \n ", "  5\nengage locally based NGOs to implement TA activities in the 15 municipalities.9 All locally \nbased NGOs shall be selected and engaged in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months. It is expected to start in January 2006 and \nbe completed in June 2007. The TA will require 21.5 person-months of consulting services, \nincluding 18 person-months from the lead NGO and 3.5 person-months from one international \nconsultant. The TA will require approximately 70 person-months from locally based NGOs. The \ninternational consultant will be recruited as individual consultant in accordance with Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. The lead NGO will be \nresponsible for overall coordination and implementation of TA and will be accountable to ADB \nas well as to LGED for the implementation of all TA activities.10 The international consultant will \nbe responsible for preparing, among other things, (i) case studies, (ii) papers for the national \nworkshop, (iii) recommendations for formulating strategies for effective mechanisms for delivery \nof municipal services and pro-poor urban governance, and (iv) the final report. Draft outline of \nterms of reference for the lead NGO and the international consultant can be found in Appendix \n3. The terms will be fine-tuned during the inception mission.  \n \n19.  The lead NGO will submit an inception report by the end of month 1 outlining a clear \nwork program and schedule of deliverables for TA. The lead NGO will submit a midterm report \nby the end of month 8, a draft final report by the beginning of month 15, and a final report by \nmonth  17.  Additionally,  the  NGO  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports.  The  international \nconsultant will prepare a draft report detailing the results of TA including (i) recommendations \nemerging from the national workshop on participatory pro-poor planning and management by \nmonth 12, (ii) case studies including a synthesis report by month 16, and (iii) a final report by \nmonth 17. All major reports shall be produced and disseminated in both Bengali and English.  \n \n20.  A letter of agreement will be signed with the lead NGO in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines. Funds will be disbursed directly to the lead NGO in quarterly installments on the \nbasis of the estimated expenditures under the TA for each ensuing 4-month period and subject \nto satisfactory liquidation of expenditures financed and previously disbursed funds. The lead \nNGO will submit to ADB an audited statement of accounts on an annual basis in respect of the \nADB funds expended. Any unutilized advances will be refunded to ADB in the currency in which \nit was disbursed.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $480,000 to the Government \nof Bangladesh to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, for \nParticipation of the Urban Poor in Municipal Governance. \n \n                                                 \n9  Criteria for selecting locally based NGOs require them to have (i) at least 5 years of operation; (ii) a management \nor advisory board; (iii) a proper accounting and financial system that is audited by a registered accountant and \nreflects a good financial track record; (iv) experience and knowledge of pro-poor municipal governance and pro-\npoor service delivery; (v) demonstrated capacity in managing complex, field-based operational activities; and (vi) at \nleast 5 years of working experiences within the required field. \n10 Annually and quarterly, detailed work and financial plans will be submitted to ADB as well as to LGED for approval. \nIn  municipalities,  the  lead  NGO  as  well  as  the  locally  based  NGOs  will  be  accountable  to  the  project \nimplementation units established under UGIIP. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nThe poor in selected  Improved indicators for  Annual socio-economic  \u2022  Central and municipal \nmunicipalities will have  urban slum dwellers\u2019  surveys  governments remain \nimproved access to  access to urban      fully committed to \nquality urban services.  services.    poverty reduction and \nroll out in all \nmunicipalities \nparticipatory pro-poor \nplanning for delivering \nurban infrastructure \nservices.  \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nInstitutional  15 municipal forums  Monitoring reports of the  \u2022  UGIIP supports and \nmechanisms for  conduct meetings  project  strengthens good urban \nincreasing the access  quarterly and prepare  TA Review Mission  governance. \nof the poor to decision- minutes.
