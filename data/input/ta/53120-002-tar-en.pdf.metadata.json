THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed project will undertake a long-term and knowledge-based approach to deliver \nclimate adaptive solutions for water resources management. It will modernize outdated irrigation \nand drainage (I&D) subprojects within Amu Darya and (selected reaches of the) Zarafshan River \nBasins in Uzbekistan. The project will increase agricultural water use productivity through a \nthreefold  approach:  (i)  climate  resilient  and  modernized  I&D  infrastructure  to  improve \nmeasurement, control and conveyance within existing systems;1 (ii) enhanced and reliable on-\nfarm water management including capacity building of water consumers associations, physical \nimprovements for land and water management at the farm level and application of high level \ntechnologies for increased water productivity; and (iii) policy and institutional strengthening for \nsustainable water resources management. This will include strategic support to the Ministry of \nWater Resources (MWR) and its provincial, basin and district agencies, and water consumers \nassociations.  \n \n2.  The project is estimated to cost $180 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nfinance $150 million from its ordinary capital resources (concessional loans). The Government of \nUzbekistan  will  provide  $30  million  through  provision  of  counterpart  staffing,  office  space, \nexemptions of taxes and duties, and interest during implementation. The transaction technical \nassistance and the ensuing loan were included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \n2019\u20132021.2 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The technical assistance (TA) will support the government to prepare subproject feasibility \nstudies of representative I&D subprojects to be developed under the ensuing loan. These studies \nwill identify proposed interventions and include technical (engineering design) and environmental, \nsocial and economic and financial assessments.3 A TA grant of $1.2 million will be required to \nprepare the ensuing loan project. It will identify suitable actions for gender inclusiveness in water \nresources management, decision making and income generation. The TA will identify requirements \nfor developing a road map for, better strategy, policy and institutional alignment for improved water \nresources management (from the river basin to on-farm) including opportunities for introducing \ntechnologies. It will also highlight areas for capacity building support in technical, procurement, \nfinancial management, etc. for relevant project agencies.4 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  Output 1: Preparation of sector roadmap. This output will support strategic actions for \nwater resources management in Uzbekistan, with specific links to investment project activities. It \nwill include selected actions for strengthening the policy, legal, and institutional aspects based on \n                                                \n1  The project will also support the detailed design for modernization of the overall Zarafshan River Basin Irrigation \nSystem for a proposed loan to be approved by ADB in 2022 for a tentative amount of $150 million. \n2  Reflected in ADB country operations business plan for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132021. \n3  The TA will prepare detailed designs for main elements of I&D systems which will be sufficient for preparation of bid \ndocuments and cost estimation to within a +/- 10% range. Additional designs and drawings for remaining structures \nwould be prepared by implementation/ supervision consultancy. For detailed designs, topographic survey is required \nfor channels (irrigation and drainage), embankments and structures. For land surface, the TA will procure and use \ndigital terrain modelling (e.g. 1-meter resolution imagery) that should be sufficiently accurate. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 June 2019. \n ", "2 \nthe application of the Australia-developed WaterGuide framework.5 The output will develop: (i) \nasset  management  and  improved  operation  and  maintenance  actions,  (ii)  institutional \nstrengthening for river basin planning, and (iii) improvements in water resources measurement \nand management in selected sub-basins (and/or I&D systems) of the Amu Darya river basin. It \nwill also prepare a pilot for volumetric measurement of irrigation water supplies, pricing and cost \nrecovery mechanisms on a suitable representative subproject. The output will complement the \nGovernment of Uzbekistan\u2019s request to ADB to support development of its water resources \nstrategy to 2030.  \n \n5.  Output 2: Preparation of investment project. This output will apply the prior agreed \nselection criteria to prepare a shortlist of future investment subprojects which will be developed \nduring loan implementation. It will develop (at least two) representative subprojects to feasibility \nstage. This will include: (i) topographic and geotechnical surveys; (ii) socio-economic baseline \nsurvey of sample communities (of representative subprojects); (iii) feasibility-stage engineering \ndesign for representative subprojects; (iv) development of relevant on-farm interventions including \ndesign and implementation methodology; (iv) undertake economic and financial analysis; (v) \npreparation  of  financial  and  procurement  management  due  diligence  and  action  plan;  (vi) \npreparation of project safeguards in line with ADB and government requirements; (vii) preparation \nof sector assessment and development coordination report; (viii) preparation of project cost \nestimate,  financing  plan,  risk  assessment  and  management  plan,  gender  action  plan, \nprocurement plan, implementation schedule, implementation arrangements including role of \nMWR and other stakeholders, and design and monitoring framework including target and baseline \nindicators  and  data  sources;  (ix)  preparation  of  technical  specifications  and  draft  bidding \ndocuments  for  first  procurement  package;  and  (x)  draft  documentation  for  ADB  Board \nconsideration and feasibility design report for internal government project approval as required.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n6.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are in Appendix 1.6 \n \n7.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of relevant counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance and other in-kind contributions. The \ngovernment was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  ADB will administer the TA. It will include specialist support for preparation of representative \nsubproject feasibility studies including technical (including procurement), environmental, social and \neconomic and financial assessments and proposed interventions. The TA will identify suitable \nactions for gender inclusiveness in water resources management, decision making, and income \ngeneration. It will also be designed to identify requirements for strategy and policy, legal and \ninstitutional road development for improved transboundary water resources management including \nopportunities for introducing technologies. The TA will highlight areas for capacity building support \nin technical, procurement, financial management, etc. for relevant project agencies. ADB\u2019s Central \n                                                \n5  This will be developed with support from Aither, Australia. \n6  The Australian Water Partnership will provide the equivalent of Australian $100,000 for technical services to finance \na river basin management specialist and associated services by Australian experts. The Department of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade, Australia will also provide technical services to support output 1. This will be to facilitate the \nGovernment of Uzbekistan on developing a strategic roadmap for water resources management. \n ", "3 \nand West Asia Department will select, supervise and evaluate consultants, and procure goods \n(para. 11). \n \n9.  MWR will be the executing agency of the TA, with Deputy Minister assigned as Project \nDirector. The Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-industry and Food \nSecurity will be the implementing agency for the ensuing loan project. A working group for \ncoordination of TA activities will be established by MWR, the Ministry of Investment and Foreign \nTrade, and the Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-industry and Food \nSecurity  for  the  efficient  preparation  of  the  loan  project  and  facilitation  of  its  approval  by \ngovernment agencies.  \n \n10.
