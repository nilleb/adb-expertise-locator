THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  The government of the Republic of Uzbekistan has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to provide support by lending for the proposed Second Tashkent Province Water \nSupply Development Project.1 \n \n2.  Uzbekistan is one of Central Asia\u2019s fastest growing economies. The nation\u2019s key economic \ndriver is Tashkent Province, the nation\u2019s largest urban agglomeration and most economically \nadvanced region.2 Together with Tashkent City, the nation\u2019s capital, the province generates \nalmost 30% of the nation\u2019s total gross domestic product (GDP). The province is experiencing rapid \nurban growth, notably along its southwestern urban corridor, however its potential is being \nconstrained by a pervasive shortage of urban services, particularly in water supply and sanitation \n(WSS).  \n3.  Currently, many of the province\u2019s consumers endure irregular, intermittent, and poor \nquality water. Much of the province\u2019s water supply infrastructure has deteriorated significantly, \nresulting in unreliable services, high water losses, and heightened pollution risks. In many districts, \nhouseholds and businesses are hampered by frequent water supply interruptions, forcing them \nto use alternative water supply sources. Historically, the WSS sector has endured fragmented \nand dysfunctional regulatory and institutional frameworks, limited sector planning capabilities, \nweak coordination and oversight, and unclear and ineffective regulatory compliance mechanisms. \nWSS service delivery institutions have historically performed poorly. Funding constraints have \nalso been acute, exacerbated by low tariff levels and tariff collection efficiencies, limited public \nfunding, and a virtually absent private sector. Significant inequalities also exist in WSS service \nprovision, particularly between urban and rural areas, and stakeholder involvement in the sector \nhas been limited.   \n4.  The districts of Yangiyul and Chinaz, the two districts of Tashkent Province targeted by \nthis project, also suffer from these challenges. Yangiyul district\u2019s groundwater-sourced water \nsupply systems are severely dilapidated, with three of its five larger systems operating below 50% \ncapacity, and an estimated 70% of the pumping equipment of its 20 smaller water supply systems \nrequiring replacement.3 In Chinaz, only 8 of the 13 production wells of its 3 main wellfields are \noperational.4 Although some areas in Chinaz reportedly enjoy adequate water availability, other \nurban areas suffer from water rationing. These deficiencies severely undermine WSS service \nstandards,  resulting  in  deteriorating  public  health  conditions,  water  access  inequality,  and \nconstrained economic growth.  \n \n5.  Current Intervention. The government, through the assistance of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB),5 has responded to sector challenges by reorganizing and consolidating WSS sector \ninstitutions, and implementing sector-wide management, financial and cost recovery reforms. \n                                                \n1  The project is included in the country operations business plan, 2018-2020, for Uzbekistan. \n2  Tashkent Province\u2019s population is estimated to be 5.253 million (www.citypopulation.de).  \n3  Coupled with this are water quality concerns, as available water quality data indicates that total dissolved solids in \ngroundwater at one of its wellfields is close to the maximum allowable limit for drinking water. \n4  In addition, about half of its transmission and distribution mains require immediate replacement, with many of its \ntransmission main terminal branches being out of service for over 20-years. \n5  The ADB and government have collaborated closely since 2000 with over $500 million invested in the rehabilitation \nand expansion of WSS infrastructure. This assistance has benefitted over five million residents, providing them with \nsafer and more reliable WSS services. \n \n ", "2 \nInitial reforms have focused on institutional consolidation and strengthening, and were supported \nby the ADB-financed Water Supply and Sanitation Services Investment Program in 2009\u20132018.6 \nIn the second phase of the reforms, the government is overhauling the wider WSS institutional \nframework, notably through the creation of a new ministry, the Ministry of Housing and Communal \nServices (MHCS).7  \n \n6.  These reforms are yielding substantial improvements in Tashkent Province through the \noperationalization and capacity strengthening of the Tashkent Provincial Suvokova (TPS), which \nis responsible for all WSS services throughout the province.8 The TPS is also being supported \nthrough the ADB-funded Tashkent Province Water Supply Development Project,9 which is (i) \nimproving the financial, operational and system management of the TPS, and (ii) revitalizing the \nwater supply systems of Kibray and Zangiota, two of the four districts of the Kadiyra regional water \nsupply system that supplies water to an important economic growth corridor, extending from \nTashkent City to the district of Chinaz at the southwest.  \n \n7.  The proposed project, which is the second phase of the Tashkent Province Water Supply \nDevelopment Project, will revitalize the water supply systems of the other two districts of the \nKadiyra regional water supply system, namely Chinaz and Yangiyul.10  It will complement the first \nphase of the project to provide reliable and sustainable water supply services along the entire \neconomic growth corridor, which has been prioritized for water supply improvements due to its \neconomic importance, proximity to regional water sources, and poor WSS standards. In addition, \nthe  proposed  project  will  provide  supplemental  capacity  support  to  further  increase  the \nsustainability of the TPS.  A separate knowledge and support technical assistance (KSTA), to be \nfinanced by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Fund, will also support the strengthening of \noverall policy and planning in the WSS sector. \n \nB.  The Proposed Project \n \n8.  The project accords with the ADB Water Operational Plan 2011-2020,11 and is included in \nthe country operations business plan, 2018-2020, for Uzbekistan. It is aligned with the following \nimpact: improved health and living conditions in Tashkent Province. The expected outcome of the \nproject is improved and expanded access to reliable and affordable water supply services in the \nChinaz and Yangiyul districts.  The outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: (i) \nwater supply system rehabilitated and operational in the Chinaz and Yangiyul districts, and (ii) \nefficiency and sustainability of TPS and its Chinaz and Yangiyul district branches improved. The \nproject will also strengthen the project management and implementation capacity of TPS. \n                                                \n6  Lessons learned from previous ADB experience include the need to (i) reduce project commencement delays due to \nlengthy government approval procedures, (ii) ensure project coordination unit staff salaries are competitive and \ninclude incentives, (iii) adopt least-cost design and implementation solutions, and (iv) provide training for project \nimplementation personnel.  \n7  The MHCS manages government policy and interdepartmental coordination for housing and other communal \nservices sectors, including WSS, designs and implements infrastructure programs, is instrumental in improving \nregulatory frameworks, and arranges and coordinates training and vocational development initiatives. Reporting \ndirectly to the MHCS is the Agency \u201cKommunhizmat\u201d (CSA), which is responsible for the implementation of ADB and \nother externally funded projects \n8  The TPS has progressed rapidly to implement key reforms: completing inventories of its district branches, expanding \nits consumer base, increasing tariffs and improving tariff collection efficiencies, absorbing smaller water supply \nsystems, and recruiting key personnel. \n9  ADB. 2016.
