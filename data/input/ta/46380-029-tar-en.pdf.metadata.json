THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \nA.  Overall Progress of the TA cluster \n1.  The  Technical  Assistance  Cluster  (C-TA)  for  Sustainable  Infrastructure  Assistance \nProgram (SIAP) is financed by the Government of Australia through the Department of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade (DFAT) and administered by ADB1. The SIAP was approved on 13 June 2013 \nand is due to close on 30 June 2019. As of 11 August 2017, total commitments are $12,352 million \n(77%) of the approved amount, $16,102,942, against an elapsed time of 67%. Disbursements are \n$6,258,992 (51%) of commitments. Nine subprojects have been approved, three of which have \nbeen closed. An additional 4 subprojects are planned ($3.25 million) and two ongoing TAs are \nearmarked for an increase in TA amount ($1.435 million). This TA proposal is one of those \nendorsed by the Steering Committee. SIAP is on track to meet its outcome and outputs. To date, \nSIAP has supported the preparation of approved projects and programs valued at nearly $3 billion \n($2,748 million in OCR and $1,128 million in cofinancing). \n \nB.  Subproject Outcome \n2.  The TA subproject\u2019s outcome will be options for more innovative regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI) interventions on cross-border trade and investment for Indonesia. In December \n2016, Indonesian President Joko Widodo reiterated the Government\u2019s plan to develop seven \nareas bordering parts of Malaysia, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea to promote commerce, \nreduce poverty, improve general living standards, and attract workers and their families to help \nreduce severe agglomeration in Java\u2019s major urban centers. One area highlighted is to promote \ncross-border trade and investment to encourage the economic and social development of areas \nalong the border, as cross-border cooperation opens opportunities for Indonesia\u2019s inclusive \neconomic growth objectives and facilitates regional cooperation.  \n \n3.  The subproject is consistent with the Indonesia country partnership strategy 2016\u20132019 \npriorities of improved infrastructure services and better economic growth. It directly responds to \nthe crosscutting theme of regional cooperation. The subproject is also consistent the C-TA focus \non priority areas of private sector development and regional cooperation through focused policy \ndialogue.2 The TA subproject fits the priorities of the C-TA, where ADB\u2019s Indonesia country \npartnership strategy, development partnerships, private sector development including PPPs, \nknowledge management, governance and capacity development, and regional cooperation are \nsupported. It particularly fits the C-TA\u2019s identified priority of regional cooperation in Indonesia, \ngiven the government\u2019s priority of improving cross-border economic cooperation with Indonesia\u2019s \nneighboring countries, including Timor-Leste. \n4.  The TA subproject will provide critical inputs for a knowledge and support TA (KSTA) of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2019s  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment (ERCD) on \u201cImplementing the Regional Cooperation and Integration Operational \nPlan\u201d.3 The KSTA aims to support the implementation of the Operational Plan for Regional \nCooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020 (RCI-OP) of ADB approved in September 2016.4 The \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2013.

Subproject Outputs, Methods, and Activities   \n5.  Output 1: Report on cross-border services for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) \n(covering financial and business development services). The study will examine opportunities and \npriorities for improving financial and business development services in Eastern Indonesia for \ngreater cross-border trade and investment with Timor-Leste. Emphasis will be given to measures \nthat will (i) promote SMEs that have a strong potential for trade growth and product diversification; \n(ii) increase SME inclusive trade in agricultural products, agroprocessing, and tourism services; \n(iii) support cross-border trade and investment in a cross-border economic zone between East \nIndonesia and Timor-Leste; and (iv) prepare and/or strengthen SMEs in Eastern Indonesia for \ncross-border  commerce.  This  work  will  include  both  quantitative  analysis  and  qualitative \nsurvey/interview work and consultation with key development partners and local enterprises. A \npilot project and or investment will be identified. \n \n6.  Output  2:  Report  on  transport  connectivity  enhancement  to  support  trade  demand \n(covering roads and port gateways). The study will analyze infrastructure connectivity constraints \nby land (including last mile connectivity) and by sea/multi-modally. It will (i) focus on overland \nroutes from Kupang to Dili over three identified overland crossing points and maritime connectivity \nbetween Kupang and Dili; and (ii) assess constraints in Kupang to act as a gateway port. The \nconstraint analysis will take into consideration trade facilitation efficiency at cross-border points \noverland and ports, operations and maintenance constraints, and investment capacity constraints \nrelative to trade volume forecasts. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n7.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $220,000, of which $200,000 will be financed from \nthe technical assistance cluster on a grant basis by DFAT, administered by ADB (footnote 1). The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n8.  The TA subproject will be administered by Southeast Asia Department (SERD) with \ntechnical support from ERCD and in coordination with the Pacific Development. The executing \nagency of the subproject will be the Directorate of Financing and Risk Management, Ministry of \nFinance. Activities will be coordinated with relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Transport, \nMinistry of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Cooperatives and Small \nand Medium Enterprises, and the National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS).
