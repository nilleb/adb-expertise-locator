The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  broad-based  assistance  to  the \nGovernment  of  Bangladesh  for  the  education  sector  covering  primary,  secondary,  and \nnonformal education. A Primary Education Sector Development Program (PESDP) is included \nin the country strategy and program for 2006\u201320101 and was confirmed with the Government \nduring the Country Programming Mission held 23 April\u201311 May 2008. The program preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission conducted during 8\u201329 June 2008 reached an \nunderstanding with the Government and interested development partners on the rationale, \nscope, outcomes, outputs, methodology, implementation arrangements and schedule, financing \nplan, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Education Structure. Formal school education consists of early childhood education \n(ages 3\u20135)2 in formal schools, 5 years of primary education (grades 1\u20135), 3 years of lower \nsecondary education (grades 6\u20138), 2 years of secondary education (grades 9\u201310), and 2 years \nof  higher  secondary  education  (grades  11\u201312).  Nonformal  education  programs  do  not \nnecessarily follow the structured system, may have varying duration, and may or may not confer \na certification of the learning achieved. The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME) \nis responsible for primary education and nonformal education while the Ministry of Education \n(MOE) is responsible for secondary education, technical education and vocational training, and \ntertiary education. Under MOPME, the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) is responsible for \n4 types of formal primary schools out of the existing 10 types and the Bureau of Nonformal \nEducation (BNFE) is responsible for nonformal education. Some primary schools (ibtedaye \nmadrasahs,  primary  schools  attached  to  high  schools)  are  under  MOE.  However,  the \ninstitutional  framework  to  enforce  government  regulation  is  lacking  for  kindergartens,  and \nnonregistered and nongovernment schools with large enrollments. The National Curriculum and \nTextbook Board, under the MOE, is responsible for curriculum and textbooks for both primary \nand secondary education. The primary education system requires consolidation, coordination, \nand flexibility within a common framework, given the 10 types of schools and their unequal \noutcomes, and the involvement of different institutions particularly under two ministries. \n \n3.  Government Priority. The Government in its Education for All: National Plan of Action II \n(NPA II), 2003\u20132015,3 has highlighted the need to improve quality while retaining the focus on \nequitable access to basic education. That need is also reflected in the Government\u2019s Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper,4 as the poor and rural children often do not have equal access to \nquality  teaching  and  learning,  compared  to  their  more  affluent  urban  counterparts.  The \nGovernment wants PESDP to be built on NPA II and the achievements of the Second Primary \nEducation Development Program (PEDP II)5 to support its ongoing commitment to education for \nall (EFA). MOPME, DPE, BNFE, and other stakeholders have emphasized the need for a \ncomprehensive  approach  to  achieve  EFA  goals  within  a  long-term  sustainable  vision  for \nequitable access to quality education. It was recognized that basic education should cover up to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Bangladesh.

Manila. \n ", "2   \ngrade  8,  but  an  expanded  basic  education  to  grade  8  requires  analyzing  implications  on \n(i) financing, (ii) institutional arrangements, and (iii) management capacity.  \n  \n4.  Progress in the Second Primary Education Development Program. Considerable \nprogress has been made in improving access to free compulsory formal and nonformal primary \neducation through a combination of stipend, scholarship, school feeding, and other special \ninitiatives  in  addition  to  regular  support  to  formal  and  nonformal  education.  The  primary \neducation gross and net enrollment rates increased from 93.7% to 98.8% and 87% to 91%, \nrespectively, between 2005 and 2007, and the Millennium Development Goal of gender parity in \nprimary and secondary education has been achieved. Teacher recruitment and deployment \nprocedures have improved, leading to the recruitment of more qualified teachers (around 50% \nwith  bachelor\u2019s  degree  or  higher  qualification  against  the  minimum  requirement  of  higher \nsecondary certificate). In 2007, the proportion of female teachers in government primary schools \nincreased to 50% from 40% in 2004. The development of a new certificate-in-education training \nhas started and will be piloted from July 2009, while upazila (subdistrict) resource centers are \nbeing strengthened to improve in-service teacher training. Key performance indicators have \nbeen established for overall monitoring. The first round of national student assessment was \nconducted in 2006 and the second round is planned in 2008 to monitor student achievement in \ndifferent subjects in grades 3 and 5.  \n \n5.  Equitable  Access  to  Quality  Primary  Education.  Despite  substantial  progress, \nspecific segments of the population, particularly the poor, minority ethnic groups and people in \nremote and vulnerable locations,6 do not have access to education of acceptable quality that \nensures achievement of at least the minimum learning outcomes specified in the curriculum. \nThe desired improvements in quality education for these groups have been slow to materialize.  \nThe system still faces large wastage due to high repetition (average 12%) and dropout rates \n(13%) in grades 1\u20134. Student absenteeism remains high (19%), especially for boys. Equitable \naccess to quality primary education requires accelerating the implementation of strategies and \naction  plans  prepared  under  PEDP  II  for  gender  issues,  vulnerable  children, children  with \nspecial needs, and tribal children. The plans will (i) enroll around 2 million\u20133 million out-of-\nschool children, and (ii) ensure much higher primary cycle completion with minimum learning \noutcomes for all. Access and quality issues need further review to address the learning needs of \ndisadvantaged groups. There is also a need for effective coordination between different types of \ninstitutions and programs within an integrated basic education framework, and an integrated \ndatabase and school mapping. An initial poverty and social analysis is included in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  Quality of Teaching and Learning. NPA II notes major weaknesses in indicators of \nclassroom achievement and a growing quality divide between rural and urban schools. Building \non PEDP II, further reforms in education quality should focus on (i) an integrated curriculum \nframework  and  its  renewal,  with  greater  focus  on  core  competencies  including  life  skills; \n(ii) bridging formal and nonformal education, which targets mainly the rural and urban poor, \nthrough equivalency and  through partnership and coordination arrangements; (iii) textbook \nrenewal with improvements in instructional design, including simplifying textbooks and ensuring \nuse  of  supplementary  materials;  (iv)  developing  a  teacher  education  and  professional \ndevelopment framework and building on the new certificate-in-education training to establish \nteacher competencies, linking different training and mechanisms to accredit and monitor training; \nand (v) taking the whole school approach forward within a shared vision of effective learning \noutcomes to target improvements in classroom teaching and learning.  \n \n                                                 \n6For example, char (islands), haor (vulnerable lowland), urban slums, etc. \n ", "  3\n7.  Management  Capacity. Key issues in management can be clustered around three \nmajor areas: (i) the need to differentiate the regulatory function of the Government (ensure that \nall school-age children complete the primary cycle with acceptable learning outcomes) from its \nservice delivery function. This may include recognizing the involvement of other education \nproviders than the government; (ii) improving management by addressing capacity constraints \nat  all  levels  so  as  to  improve  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  institutionalizing  improved  results \nframework and results-based management with strong research support for evidence-based \nplanning, budgeting, and analytical reporting.  \n \n8.  Aid Harmonization. There were concerns about the involvement of many development \npartners in PEDP II, their internal requirements, and lack of harmonization that burden the \nGovernment  with  program  implementation.  Building  on  the  lessons  learned  from  PEDP  II \n(para. 12), further harmonization and reduction in transaction costs are necessary to streamline \nthe internal requirements of development partners and to use the Government\u2019s common policy \nand financing framework to allow interested development partners to decide on the funding \narrangements according to their priorities.   \n \n9.  Decentralization. DPE has staff and infrastructure in place down to upazila level and \nhas made some progress in decentralization under PEDP II. The planning function has been \ndecentralized  at  the  upazila  and  school  levels  with  the  implementation  of  the  school-level \nimprovement plan (SLIP) and upazila primary education plan (UPEP). However, there is a need \nto strengthen the current decentralized framework to ensure effective and efficient service \ndelivery and local accountability. Further, there is a need to introduce a policy of decentralized \nmanagement and commensurate capacity development at district, subdistrict, and school levels \nthrough integrated planning, budgeting, and monitoring. \n \n10.  Education Financing. In the past 5 years, the budget allocation to education has been \naround  15%  of  the  total  government  budget.  The  allocation  to  primary  education  in  the \neducation budget has increased from less than 40% in 2004 to over 45% in 2008. The share of \nthe total primary education budget from the revenue budget has increased from 50% in 2000 to \n65% in 2007. A considerable amount of the development budget comes from external aid, loans, \nand grants, which account for around 30% of the government development expenditures on \nbasic education. As part of the financial management reform program, the Government has \nbeen  implementing  a  medium-term  budgetary  framework  in  MOPME  since  2006.  Program \ncosting  and  financing  will  be  based  on  a  list  of  Government  priorities  and  targets,  with \ncorresponding cost estimates, and joint discussions between the Government and interested \ndevelopment partners. The consensus is that allocations to education and especially primary \neducation should increase in combination with (i) more efficient use of resources, and (ii) \nsynergy between public and private resources from all stakeholders to achieve the goals of EFA. \n \n11.   Governance.  DPE has taken important steps to improve governance by combating \ncorruption, financial irregularities, and rent-seeking in the primary education sector. In 2006, it \nwas agreed that governance issues would be addressed incrementally, starting with doable \nsteps. Identified themes were (i) teacher recruitment and deployment, (ii) managing innovative \ngrants,  (iii)  streamlining  procurement,  (iv)  implementing  SLIPs,  and  (v)  information \ndissemination. At the midterm review of PEDP II (October\u2013November 2007), it was agreed that \nthere was still a need to identify key challenges faced by the subsector, and to outline a way \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nforward and establish good governance.

Implementing the recommendations of \nthe report will assist in mainstreaming governance in PEDP II and future program activities.  \n  \n12.  Lessons  Learned.  Key  lessons  from  education  programs,  including  PEDP  II  in \nBangladesh, suggest the need for the following steps: (i) formulate a common framework for \npreprimary, primary, secondary, and nonformal education, to facilitate funding arrangements for \ninterested  development  partners  according  to  their  priorities,  instead  of  involving  all \ndevelopment partners with different requirements in one program; (ii) reduce transaction costs \nfor the Government and development partners by strengthening harmonization, streamlining \nprocedures, and establishing a stringent code of conduct for development partners and the \nGovernment as a partner to lead the program in line with the Paris Declaration; (iii) strengthen \nthe Government\u2019s capacity to implement programs that use a new funding modality; (iv) make \nprogram design and program documents flexible for essential modifications during program \nimplementation to achieve the program goals and objectives; (v) carefully analyze the trade-offs \nbetween improvements in access and quality\u2014since quality improvement is a slower process \nbut requires more direct support to schools and classrooms; and (vi) provide adequate time for \npreparation, transitional arrangements, and sequencing of reforms.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA will assist the Government in preparing a program that will support an inclusive \napproach  to  improve  the  quality,  efficiency,  and  performance  of  the  primary  education \nsubsector. The impact of the TA will be measurable progress toward equitable and quality \nlearning outcomes for all eligible school-age children, particularly the poor, ethnic minorities, \nand  those  living  in  remote  and  vulnerable  areas.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outputs: \n(i) situation analysis and lessons learned; (ii) a macro plan for the PESDP, including a common \npolicy and financing framework and a joint-partnership agreement with options for coordinated \nfinancing  from  the  Government  and  interested  development  partners  including  ADB,  in  a \nprogram-based approach; and (iii) a proposed program design with clusters of pooled and \nparallel  financing  modalities  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  EFA  program  through  flexible \nimplementation arrangements and targeted capacity development to support quality and equity \nat the school level. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The PESDP will be prepared in two phases: the first phase, to be funded by interested \ndevelopment  partners,  will  cover  a  rapid  assessment  and  lessons  learned  from  various \ninterventions in basic education, including PEDP II. The analysis will build on achievements and \nexisting  gaps  to  identify  what  has  worked  and  what  should  be  continued,  what  needs \nimprovements, what needs to be expanded, and what needs to be avoided. Based on the rapid \nassessment, the second phase, to be financed by ADB TA with some parallel support from \ninterested development partners, will develop a macro plan for PESDP. The plan will include a \ncommon  policy  and  financing  framework  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  NPA  II  to  ensure \ncommon learning outcomes for all children regardless of the type of school they attend.   \n  \n15.  In  the  second  phase,  the  TA  will  (i)  review  teacher  education  and  professional \ndevelopment initiatives; (ii) assess curriculum and textbook improvement needs; (iii) analyze \ninstitutions, including implications of further decentralization at the field level for managing the \nEFA program; (iv) design targeted interventions for equitable access; (v) review options for \npublic\u2013private partnership, particularly in strengthening field capacity to support the delivery of \nservices; (vi) analyze financial needs and assess fiduciary risks; and (vii) explore opportunities \n ", "  5\nfor further aid harmonization in line with the spirit of the Paris Declaration. The reviews will \npropose areas and modalities for reforms and implementation arrangements.  \n \n16.  The TA will conduct stakeholder workshops and focus-group discussions to (i) verify and \nsupport the analysis of the situation; (ii) solicit inputs and feedback on key issues pertaining to \nquality, equity, and related institutional and financial arrangements; and (iii) prepare a detailed \ncosting  plan  for  PESDP.  Stakeholders  will  include  parents,  students,  members  of  school \nmanagement committees, head teachers, teachers, teacher associations, district and upazila \neducation officers, instructors at primary training institutes and upazila resource centers, experts \nincluding consultants in PEDP II, and representatives from nongovernment organizations and \nacademic and research institutions.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is expected to cost $1,139,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $990,000, financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. ADB will \nfinance  national  and  international  consulting  services,  production  of  reports,  required \nequipment, car rental, workshops, studies, field surveys, and administrative support services. \nGovernment support to the TA, estimated at $149,000 equivalent, will be in kind, and will \ninclude counterpart staff, space for office and meetings, and general office support. Interested \ndevelopment partners will supplement the TA cost for other experts and related requirements. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing program. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MOPME will be the Executing Agency, and DPE and BNFE the implementing agencies \nfor the TA. A TA steering committee will be established with the secretary of MOPME as \nchairperson, and with representatives from MOPME, DPE, BNFE, Ministry of Finance, Planning, \nEconomic Relations Division, development partners, and Campaign for Popular Education to \nprovide overall guidance to the TA team. The joint secretary (development) will be the overall \ncoordinator of the steering committee. Other members may be co-opted as appropriate. A \ndevelopment partner task force will also be formed, with a coordinator. The steering committee \nwill  meet  monthly  to  (i) monitor  TA  progress,  (ii)  facilitate  coordination  among  government \nagencies, development partners, and other stakeholders, and (iii) support the processing of the \nensuing Program within the Government\u2019s priorities. The Government will appoint focal points \nfrom MOPME, DPE, and BNFE to work directly with the TA team in identified areas. The focal \npersons will also attend the steering committee meetings as appropriate. MOPME will provide \nadministrative  support  and  designate  adequate  office  space.  The  office  will  have  utilities, \nfurniture,  local  telephone  services,  and  internet  access.  The  consulting  firm  will  procure \nequipment,  software,  and  furniture,  as  necessary,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment, software, and furniture will be \ntransferred to the Government upon TA completion.  \n \n19.  The TA will engage consultants to provide 86 person-months of inputs (international, \n23 person-months and national, 63 person-months). ADB will engage the consultants through a \nfirm, using the quality- and cost-based selection method as well as on an individual basis in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntTimhee )v.i eAwlsl  eTxApr-efisnsaendc heedr egino aordes t hwosilel  obfe t hpe rcoocnusrueldta nitn a nlidn ed ow niotht  neAcDeBss\u2019sa riPlyr roecpureresmenet ntht oGseu oidf eAlDinBe\u2019ss.  \nImnteemrebsetresd, B doeavrde loofp Dmireenctto prsa, rMtnaenrasg ewmille nuts, eo rt shteaifrf , raensdp mecatyiv bee  pprroeclimedinuarreys i nf onra tcuoren.s  ultants that they \nwill finance.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nBased on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the project \nwould directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the partner \ncountry. \n \nBangladesh has progressed substantially in improving access to primary education in the last decade. The country has also \nachieved the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of gender parity in primary and secondary education. Gross and net \nenrollments in primary education increased to 98.8% and 91.1%, respectively, in 2007a. Despite progress, the primary \neducation subsector faces several challenges in achieving the goal of equitable access to quality education for all.  Various \ndisadvantaged groups, particularly children from remote and vulnerable areas, the poor, minority ethnic groups, and people in \nurban slums do not have access to quality schooling. More than 10 types of schools under different institutions operate without \na framework for common learning outcomes. It is estimated that 2 million\u20133 million children are out of school, despite various \nGovernment initiatives (stipends, school feeding, special projects). Access to quality education, particularly minimum learning \noutcomes to all as stipulated in the national curriculum and improved cycle completion for those facing various forms of \nexclusion, remains limited. Due to poverty induced by natural calamities and other shocks, many families resort to nonformal \nand madrasahb education, which do not follow a common standard framework.  \n \nIn its draft National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (NSAPR) for 2009\u20132011, the Government identified education \nas key to poverty reduction. The NSAPR aims at ensuring completion of quality primary education for all children irrespective of \nsocial, geographic, gender, ethnic differences as well as differential physical and mental capabilities. The Government\u2019s \nNational Plan of Action II (NPA II), 2003\u22122015, is committed to the education for all (EFA) program and highlights the need for \nimproving quality while retaining the focus on equitable access to basic education. The NSAPR and the NPA II reinforce the \nGovernment\u2019s Compulsory Primary Education Act of 1990. The NSAPR provides for different specific initiatives to ensure \nequitable access to quality education, retention, and equity at the primary level for all: primary education stipend for children \nfrom poor families; expanding nonformal education targeted to the extremely poor and those in remote areas; reducing the \neducation divide in terms of contents and standards between different streams; covering underserved areas; improving the \nequity of outcome through allocation of appropriate resources; having a need-based program for the physically challenged and \nother vulnerable children; and introducing the school feeding program.   \n \nThe Second Primary Education Development Program (PEDP II) under the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME), \nthe first subsector-wide approach jointly financed by the Government and 11 development partners, including the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) as the lead development partner, is addressing several aspects of the EFA goals. The Government, \ntogether with the development partners, will develop a follow-on program based on the lessons learned and the Government\u2019s \npriorities articulated in NPA II, NSAPR, and other related documents. The program preparatory technical assistance (TA) will \nundertake an assessment including lessons learned, develop a macro plan for universal primary education and a proposal for \nthe Primary Education Sector Development Program (PESDP) for the Government, to be supported jointly by interested \ndevelopment partners. The PESDP will aim to reinforce the ongoing reforms within a well-developed policy framework based \non lessons learned from PEDP II. The design will specifically address the inclusive education agenda with a focus on \ndeepening reforms to address the needs of the poor and other excluded groups. The TA will consider coverage of underserved \nareas, special measures to encompass various vulnerable groups and children with special needs, and ways to expand the \ncoverage of the stipend program.  \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n  General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: (TI \u2013 M2) \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nWhile substantial progress in expanding access to primary school has been achieved, (i) around 2 million\u20133 million school-age \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nchildren are estimated to be out of school; (ii) a significant portion of students drop out before completing the primary cycle due \nto various constraints they face at home and school; and (iii) a large percentage of those that complete the primary cycle leave \nwith insufficient learning achievement. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Bangladesh (2006\u20132010) identified a low overall \nlevel  of human development, including functional literacy as  a key poverty  indicator. The country strategy considered \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nimprovement of quality and relevance of primary education for the poor, women, and other excluded groups as a key priority. It \nalso emphasized partnership with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and support for modernizing the madrasah school \ncurriculum. The TA will develop a program to support the Government in achieving target 3 of primary education for all children \nand as identified in MDG-2, which is in line with the country strategy.   \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  Not applicable \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \n \nADB together with the Government and interested development partners will allocate resources to undertake the required \nassessments. Consultants  with experience in PEDP II, existing assessments, and experience of different stakeholders \nincluding other education providers will (i) identify the causes of exclusion and possible remedial measures; (ii) identify \nmeasures for ensuring minimum learning outcomes for all children in all types of school; (iii) identify and recommend specific \npositive measures for various groups to enroll in and complete primary education; (iv) identify needs and suggest means of \neffective partnership with other primary education providers, including NGOs, for inclusive education; (v) suggest ways to \nfacilitate convergence and equivalence between various streams; (vi) suggest means for effective targeting for the stipend \nprogram;  (vii)  identify  areas  of  improvement  of  the  inclusive  education  framework  and  related  action  plans  and  their \nimplementation; and (viii) develop a proposal for the Government as a follow-on to PEDP II. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)?  \n \nPESDP will cover all children of all districts of the country. The existing inclusive education framework and four action plans \n(gender, disability, tribal, and other vulnerability) developed under PEDP II will be reviewed, lessons from other streams will be \nconsidered, and a realistic and refined framework for the next phase will be suggested. The program design will ensure that the \npoor and excluded groups benefit and will consider (i) effective targeting of stipend programs to include all excluded groups; \n(ii) expanding education coverage to all poor and vulnerable children; (iii) developing action plans with specific support, \nincluding infrastructure for different groups based on differential needs identified (char and haor areas, minor disability, tribal \nchildren, street children, urban slums, gender, etc.); (iv) improving the capacity of teachers and staff in addressing inclusive \neducation needs; (v) means to ensure learning outcomes for all poor and vulnerable children; (vi) instructional materials and \nother essential items for education; and (vi) resource requirements to ensure inclusive education.  \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nGenerally, all school-age children will be the primary beneficiaries. In view of the number of out-of-school children and low \nstudent achievement, it is essential to adopt specific measures considering the differential needs of various groups of children. \nA complete school mapping exercise will be undertaken to map all types of schools\u2014formal, nonformal, and madrasah\u2014to \nassess their coverage. Assessing the inputs and learning outcomes of various types of schools will provide empirical foundation \nfor policy intervention and ensure convergence and equivalence in quality among the different streams. A comprehensive \ndatabase to monitor performance against EFA and MDG goals and also access and achievement of the various groups is \nessential. A broader quality assurance mechanism for all schools covered under NPA II, including a reliable mechanism for \nmonitoring, is required. The PPTA will suggest measures to address those issues in the program design, including a framework \nfor inclusive education and action plans to meet the needs of the poor and other excluded groups. \n    \n2. What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThe children of Bangladesh need access to quality education. Many children from different communities and remote locations \nare yet to access primary education. Slow learners and children with special needs require special attention to ensure their right \nto quality education. Children of poor families are considered an economic force and often compelled to provide child labor. The \nchildren of some professionals and other groups, such as sex workers, are not considered equal. All these children need \nspecial attention and provision to access and complete primary education.        \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nMany families can afford the general primary education system for their children. Yet, a large number of families cannot afford \nto send their children to school. Therefore, the existing provision of free schooling, books, uniform, stipend for the poor will \nensure schooling for children from low-income families. Besides, the program will refine and ensure the implementation of an \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \ninclusive education framework developed under PEDP II that will enable other poor and excluded groups benefit from the \nprogram. The innovative grants scheme and school-level improvement plans (SLIPs) initiated under PEDP II will be refined and \nstrengthened to support equitable access to primary education for the most vulnerable groups. Support for targeted capacity \ndevelopment and technical assistance will be provided to the Executing Agency to help it in facilitating and managing the \nparticipatory process in education management and promotion of inclusive education.   \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \n \nThe initial stakeholder is the Government of Bangladesh. The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME) will be the \nExecuting Ministry and the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) will implement PESDP. The Bureau of Nonformal Education \n(BNFE) and other government ministries and agencies will also be involved. The Local Government Engineering Department \nwill be responsible for infrastructure development activities. Interested development partners will support the Government in the \ndesign and subsequent implementation phase. Partnership arrangements will be determined to establish effective engagement \nof NGOs in ensuring education for various excluded groups.  \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of non-government organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nDifferent types of consultation and participation will be required at different levels. During the TA, continuous dialogue and \ncollaboration will be maintained in a planned manner with the development partners, and various government ministries and \ndepartments to develop and agree on a macro framework and coverage of the PESDP. NGOs will be involved to capture good \npractices and design a partnership mechanism for working together under the framework. At the community level, consultation \nand workshops will be required for social, gender, and environmental assessments; and assessment of the requirements for \ninclusive education and for developing action plans and strategies. The TA will review the existing participation mechanisms of \nPEDP II (teacher associations, school management committee, parent\u2013teacher associations, SLIPs and upazila [subdistrict] \nprimary education plan [UPEP] development, and field-level institutions) and suggest ways for effective partnership and \nparticipation during the implementation phase.  \n  \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nInvolvement of the Government, development partners, community, teacher associations, NGOs, and other stakeholders is \nessential for the success of PESDP. Community participation to ensure inclusive education is emphasized by the NSAPR. The \nTA will examine the lessons from PEDP II, which through introduction of SLIPs and UPEPs, promotes a community-oriented \nframework for primary education.  An effective, practical, and inclusive participation strategy will be developed for PESDP \nbased on the findings and considering the needs and interests of diverse group of stakeholders and beneficiaries. Means to \nstrengthen the linkages, complementarities, and cooperation with the various agencies, development partners, and education \nproviders will be pursued to ensure that the benefits from the PESDP intervention are maximized.   \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n\u2022  Gender equality in enrollment at the primary level has been achieved. Parity in the proportion of female teachers has \nalso been achieved in government primary schools. But educational attainment and dropout rates for girls are important \nissues. Girls\u2019 education as a means to women\u2019s empowerment is not widely shared yet. Early marriage is still prevalent \nin Bangladesh. Education of girls in remote locations and from different excluded groups is discouraged. Girls are often \nused as supporting workforce in households and that hinders their educational progress.  At times girls are discouraged \nto attend schools due to social insecurity and perceived poverty more than actual poverty. \n\u2022  In some areas, more girls than boys are in schools. There is a need to identify such areas and adopt measures that will \nensure that all boys of school age attend school.   \n\u2022  Gender equality in the teaching force in government primary schools has been achieved, but efforts are needed to \npromote women\u2019s participation in other schools and in education management. \n \nTh2e.   vDieowess  tehxep rperospsoesde dh eprreoijne cat/rper othgroasme  ohaf vthee t hceo npsouteltnatniatl  aton dp rdoom ontoet  gneencdeesrs aeqriulya lriteyp arensde/onr t wthoomseen \u2019osf  eAmDpBo\u2019ws erment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nmaking?

The TA will assess the effectiveness of integrating gender aspects in the \nongoing PEDP II and identify ways to maximize the impact of the policies and measures promoting girls\u2019 participation and \ngender equality. Women will benefit from the teacher recruitment under the PESDP. Women will play a significant role in \neducation management at the community level through school management committees and parent\u2013teacher associations. A \nrealistic gender action plan with adequate resource provisions will be prepared as part of the inclusive education framework \nduring the TA. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?        \n          Yes          No    Please explain \nIII.

Introduction \n \n1.  The design work for the Primary Education Sector Development Program (PESDP) will \ntake more than 7 months to complete. It has two phases. It is expected to start in January 2009 \nand complete in July 2009. Except for Norway, all 11 development partners involved in Primary \nEducation Development Program II (PEDP II) expressed interest in supporting activities before \nand during the implementation of the program preparatory technical assistance (TA); however, \nno firm commitment to finance specific activities had been received by the time fact-finding for \nthe TA ended on 29 June 2008. The phase 1 activity (start in January 2009), includes activities \nthat will be undertaken by some development partners as described below. Phase 2 (February\u2013\nJuly 2009) will be supported by Asian Development Bank (ADB) and comprises major activities \nrequired for designing the program, including reviewing and confirming some of the activities \nand findings in phase 1. The TA will be implemented in a flexible manner. The scope and \nfinancing of activities will be adjusted to accommodate contributions from other development \npartners as appropriate. In case development partners do not support some activities in phase \n1, or if additional activities for designing the program are needed during TA implementation, a \nlump sum amount has been allocated for individual consultants1 to be fielded as necessary \nduring phase 2. The TOR of the consultants may be revised, whenever necessary, to ensure \nmaximum utilization of the Technical Assistance and to avoid duplication with the provisions of \nthe existing programme/projects. \n \nB.  Phase 1: Activities Funded by Development Partners  \n \n2.  A  number  of  activities  will  be  carried  out  in  January  2009  and  will  be  funded  by \ninterested development partners. Some activities may continue beyond this stage and overlap \nwith phase 2 activities. Interested development partners will use their respective procedures to \nrecruit consultants and will closely work with the Government, particularly the Ministry of Mass \nand Primary Education (MOPME), Department of Primary Education (DPE), and Bureau of \nNonformal Education (BNFE), as well as ADB, to produce phase 1 outputs that will feed into the \nphase 2 activities. Phase 1 will involve (i) rapid assessment and stocktaking; (ii) finance and \neconomic  analysis;  (iii)  comprehensive  national  framework  for  all  school  education;  (iv)  \nintegrated national education policy framework; (v)  education management information system \nand research capacity for policy development (vi) early childhood education. (vii) nonformal \neducation; (viii) assessment and monitoring; and (ix) innovation and improvement grants.  \n \nC.  Phase 2: The ADB Program Preparatory Technical Assistance  \n3.  ADB will engage the consultants through a firm, using quality- and cost-based selection \ncriteria, as well as on an individual basis in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Under a firm, 7 international (18 person-\nmonths) and 13 national consultants (46 person-months) will be engaged. A pool of international \n(5 person-months) and national (17 person-months) consultants are also included in consultant \ncategory to be employed as individual consultants as required, or if there is a need to extend the \nwork  of  existing  consultants.    Therefore,  to  implement  the  TA,  ADB  will  employ  a  total \ninternational (23 person-months) and national consultants (63 person-months), for a total of 86 \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nperson-months.
