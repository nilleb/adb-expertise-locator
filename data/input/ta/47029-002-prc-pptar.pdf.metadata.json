Justification \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) is required to prepare an investment project for possible \nfunding  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  development  of  technical  and \nvocational education and training (TVET) in Shanxi Province in the People's Republic of China \n(PRC). The investment project components will include capacity building (strengthening TVET \nmanagement and planning capacity, training of instructors, development of competency-based \ncurriculum (CBC), and strengthening industry-school collaboration); and upgrading of TVET \nfacilities and equipment. The government was advised that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  TA activities will be implemented in two phases. Phase one will involve a review of the \nTVET sector  in  Shanxi  and the  PRC  in general, to facilitate  project scoping  by  individual \nconsultants. Phase two will involve mobilization of a TA consulting firm. The TA consulting firm \nwill prepare the following outputs: (i) an inception report outlining the overall implementation \nplan within the first month of consultant mobilization, with a detailed proposed methodology for \nthe financial and economic analyses, a labor market analysis, and a social and poverty survey \nand data collection requirements and schedule; (ii) an interim report with a detailed assessment \nof the project components at the interim stage along with key policy and specific project-related \nissues within the third month of consultant mobilization; (iii)  a technical report confirming that all \nproject-financed  buildings  are  technically  sound,  meet  all  relevant  technical  and  safety \nstandards, and incorporate energy-efficiency and resources-conservation measures, a generic \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) covering design, construction, and operation phase of \nthe project, draft resettlement plans or due diligence reports, draft gender action plan (GAP), \ndraft social action plan, draft procurement capacity assessment, and draft financial management \nassessment within the fifth month of consultant mobilization; (iv) a draft final report with a \ndetailed  assessment  of  the  technical,  financial,  economic,  environmental,  social,  and \ninstitutional aspects within the fifth month of consultant mobilization; and (v) a final report within \nthe  seventh  month  of  consultant  mobilization.  The  TA  consulting  firm  will  deliver  capacity \nbuilding training on project design and project performance and monitoring system, ADB\u2019s \nsafeguards policy, and ADB\u2019s disbursement and procurement policies and guidelines.
