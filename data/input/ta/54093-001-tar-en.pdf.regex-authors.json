INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide just-in-time, demand-\ndriven, and cutting-edge knowledge products and assist capacity development in Kazakhstan. \nThe fourth phase of the Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program (KEEP), a joint effort of \nthe Government of Kazakhstan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), remains an important \nsource of international best practices, innovative solutions, and capacity development of staff \nworking for Kazakhstan\u2019s government agencies. As experienced in the previous three phases, \nthe joint financing and management of TA activities will produce synergies and complementarities \nbetween ADB operations and Kazakhstan\u2019s development needs.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with one of the operational priorities\u2014strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity\u2014of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.1 It helps reinforce ADB\u2019s role as a knowledge \ninstitution that facilitates the sharing of international experiences, best practices, and innovations \nin line with its approach to engaging with upper middle-income countries. 2 It is also consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132021 for Kazakhstan, which emphasizes the \nimportance  of  enhancing  the  country\u2019s  knowledge  basis  in  support  of  its  socioeconomic \ndevelopment.3 The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023.4  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Kazakhstan has enjoyed rapid economic growth in the 21st century, fueled by windfall \nearnings from the extractive industry, which by 2019 had tripled oil production since independence \nin 1991. Real wages quadrupled from the mid-1990s levels, while the share of people with below-\nsubsistence incomes plummeted from 46.7% in 2001 to 4.3% in 2019. However, this rapid \neconomic growth came at the cost of unequal income distribution across sectors, social groups, \nand regions of Kazakhstan. For instance, by 2005, the Gini index, a convenient summary measure \nof the degree of economic inequality in the distribution of income, had reached 39.8 (where 0 \nindicates perfect income equality, 100 implies perfect inequality), before subsiding to 28.8 in 2018. \n \n4.  The unequal distribution of economic benefits generated by the oil and gas industry \nbecame  evident  in  the  labor  market  and  created  development  challenges.  The  Statistics \nCommittee of Kazakhstan reports that the remuneration offered in mining was on average more \nthan double the average monthly pay, while the salaries of civil servants were below the average. \nThis made it difficult to attract and retain talents in the civil service, while promoting corruption \nand rent-seeking activities. Meanwhile, the economy was experiencing signs of the so-called \n\u201cDutch disease,\u201d as exogenous shocks generated by the 2007\u20132008 global financial crisis, lower \ncommodity prices in 2014\u20132015, and the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nrevealed structural vulnerabilities in Kazakhstan\u2019s economic model as being too dependent on \nexport revenues generated from hydrocarbons. \n \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \nAccording to the sixth operational priority, ADB will help developing member countries improve governance and create \nan enabling environment for sustainable growth by strengthening the quality and capacity of public institutions to \nundertake policy reforms. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 February 2020. \n3 ADB. 2017.

Country Operations Business Plan: Kazakhstan, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n ", " \n2 \n5.  Recognizing the country\u2019s knowledge needs, ADB and the Government of Kazakhstan in \n2013 established KEEP through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that defined the \nprogram\u2019s overall framework and outlined its objective and scope, areas of focus, implementation \narrangements, and monitoring and evaluation measures.5 The MOU commits the parties to \nsharing the costs of program implementation activities equally.   \n \n6.  The initial plan suggested the articulation of KEEP over three phases. However, taking \ninto account Kazakhstan\u2019s growing demand for knowledge products, by 2015 the total amount of \ncommitments and disbursements had already exceeded the indicative amounts of the 2013 MOU. \nTo reflect the changed reality, the MOU was updated three times\u2014in 2015, 2017, and 2019\u2014by \nintroducing supplementary agreements aimed at ensuring greater flexibility and responsiveness \nto the government needs for cutting-edge knowledge, best practices, and capacity enhancement. \nThe revised MOU reflects the additional financial commitments made by the parties. The KEEP \nfinancing plan for the period 2013\u20132022 is shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program \u2013 Financing Plan \nTotal financing  Asian Development  Government of \nYear \n($)  Bank  Kazakhstan \nPhase 1 (2013\u20132016)  500,000  250,000  250,000 \nPhase 2 (2015\u20132018)  1,000,000  500,000  500,000 \nPhase 3 (2017\u20132020)  2,000,000  1,000,000  1,000,000  \nPhase 4 (2020\u20132022, indicative)  2,000,000a  1,000,000  1,000,000 \nTotal  5,500,000   2,750,000   2,750,000  \na The supplementary agreement to the memorandum of understanding, signed on 30 December 2019, commits parties \nto allocating $1,000,000 each to Phase 4 of the program. On 30 April 2020, the Government of Kazakhstan transferred \nits financing obligation, but because of currency fluctuations the Asian Development Bank (ADB) received $877,000. \nSubsequently, in light of the high demand for knowledge products and services, ADB and the government agreed to \nprocess the technical assistance with a budget of $1,754,000, i.e., ADB matched the government\u2019s contribution to date. \nIn early 2021, the Kazakhstan Resident Mission will process a $246,000 budget increase upon receiving the \ngovernment\u2019s remaining contribution of $123,000 and ADB matching that contribution. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n7.  KEEP\u2019s  flexible  approach,  envisaged  in  the  original  MOU  and  its  supplementary \nagreements,  allows  to  effectively  fulfill  Kazakhstan\u2019s  demand-driven  knowledge  needs  as \narticulated by government agencies in their applications; the tentative pipeline of KEEP projects \nis described in a linked document.6 The applications can be grouped into four broad categories: \n(i) analytical support of the government\u2019s economic diversification agenda, (ii) sustainable green \ngrowth, (iii) reform of the civil service system, and (iv) socioeconomic research into priority topics.  \n \n8.  The economy of Kazakhstan is overly reliant on commodities extraction and export. In \n2019, minerals accounted for 72.8% of exports, followed by metals with 13.5%. In the same period, \n39.4% of the state budget revenues came from duty receipts for oil exports and sovereign oil fund \ntransfers.  In  the  previous  phases,  the  KEEP  team  supported  the  government\u2019s  economic \ndiversification agenda with research into Kazakhstan's agriculture, including an assessment of \nthe  livestock  potential  in  Aqmola  Region,  and  with  the  development  of  light  industry  and \ncraftsmanship in close collaboration with Atameken, the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs. For \nPhase 4, the government agencies propose various projects aimed at promoting tourism, building \nhuman capital, and improving the investment climate.  \n                                                \n5 The MOU between the Government of Kazakhstan and ADB was signed on 5 June 2013; the supplementary \nagreements were signed on 25 April 2015, 26 December 2017, and 30 December 2019. \n6 Tentative List of Activities/Projects Proposed for Phase 4 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n3). \n ", " \n3 \n \n9.  The government recognizes the promotion of sustainable green growth as crucial to \nimproving the quality of life. In 2015, the government committed to reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions by 15% by 2030 under the Paris Agreement. In 2019, greenhouse gas emissions \nalready exceeded the 1990 level (the benchmark year for the Paris Agreement target), while \nprojected economic growth is expected to further stimulate such emissions. So, the government \nis drafting a new Environmental Code and Low-carbon Development Strategy to better respond \nto the need for sustainable green growth until 2050. In Phase 4, ADB will work closely with the \ngovernment on providing methodological, strategic, and capacity building support to enable \nenvironmentally friendly economic development. \n \n10.  Reforming civil service is a cornerstone of the government\u2019s development agenda and is \nprominently featured in development strategies and plans. Transparency International\u2019s 2019 \nCorruption Perception Index puts Kazakhstan in 113th place out of 180 economies, which is \nmarginally better than its 140th position in 2013. In September 2020, in his second annual address \nto the people of Kazakhstan, President Tokayev announced major reforms to the state apparatus, \nincluding a 25% optimization of civil servants and raising salaries to the rest. The KEEP team has \nbeen strengthening the civil service system by optimizing the business processes, conducting \ntime studies, and setting performance indicators; this collaboration will continue in Phase 4. \n \n11.  Increasingly, the government is prioritizing social policy measures, especially as the \nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy are being felt. Many of KEEP\u2019s past and \nplanned projects therefore serve to study and develop recommendations on socioeconomic policy \nmeasures.  For  instance,  ADB,  in  close  cooperation  with  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme, supports the government in becoming the regional champion to achieve the all-\nencompassing  sustainable  development  goals  (SDGs).  In  particular,  KEEP  assisted  the \ngovernment in preparing the Voluntary National Report on SDGs, which was presented at the \nUnited Nation\u2019s High-level Political Forum in July 2019.  \n \n12.  Overall, the government consistently assessed the KEEP results very positively, praising \nthe progress made since 2014 and expressing its commitment to continue the cooperation with \nADB  on  this  program.  Particularly,  the  government  commended  KEEP\u2019s  contribution  to \nstrengthening institutional capacity and providing policy advice.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: accountability, efficiency, and functionality of \nthe state apparatus increased.7 The TA will have the following outcome: state development \ninitiatives relying on enhanced capacity and evidence-based practice effectively implemented.8  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n14.  Output 1: Reports and policy recommendations delivered. The TA will support sector \nand thematic projects promoting knowledge solutions and use of international best practices. The \nrecommendations emanating from demand-driven research will inform the government\u2019s national \n                                                \n7  Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 2012. Strategy Kazakhstan - 2050. Astana (Nur-Sultan). \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", " \n4 \nor sector plans, and policy actions. Analytical reports will serve as background materials for the \ngovernment\u2019s policymaking and may be combined with capacity building and learning events as \nneeded. \n \n15.  Based on the government\u2019s request to further raise KEEP\u2019s profile and strengthen policy \ndialogue, Phase 4 will deliver for the first time the publication of an index of economic convergence \namong the regions of Kazakhstan. The publication will cater to the promotion of inclusive spatial \ndevelopment and reinforce ADB\u2019s role as knowledge provider for upper middle-income countries. \nThe index will give Kazakhstan an evidence-based tool to underpin its policy dialogue with \ndevelopment partners, academia, the business community, and other stakeholders.9   \n \n16.  Output 2: Capacity building programs provided. The TA will also support the delivery \nof capacity development programs to be provided at the request of the government for a select \nnumber of civil servants and other stakeholders, as appropriate. Capacity building programs are \nimportant to raise awareness of international best practices and boost the government's policy \nformulation and implementation capacity. In this regard, the TA will help fill critical gaps in the skill \nsets of authorities and enable them to implement government policies more effectively and \nefficiently. Depending on the type of support required, the capacity building programs can also be \norganized as part of broader knowledge solutions that integrate the delivery of reports and policy \nrecommendations as in output 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,754,000, of which $877,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $877,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Kazakhstan and administered by ADB.10 The TA \nfunds will cover the costs of hiring international and national consulting services, organizing \ncapacity building sessions and workshops for local stakeholders, and conducting other related \nactivities as deemed necessary by the  KEEP Coordinating Committee (KCC) and in close \ncoordination with ADB and the government. The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  As in previous KEEP phases and in accordance with the MOU, the Ministry of National \nEconomy (MNE) will be the executing agency. The line ministries and other government entities \nwill be the implementing agencies depending on the thematic areas and sectors of the approved \nprojects. The Kazakhstan Resident Mission of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will \nadminister the TA, in close coordination with ADB\u2019s sector and thematic groups. ADB will select, \nsupervise, and evaluate consultants, organize consultation workshops and training, and provide \nstaff to act as task managers and/or resource persons as required.  \n \n19.  In line with the MOU, the overall supervision, administration, and management of KEEP \nactivities will be carried out by the KCC, consisting of government and ADB staff. At least once a \nyear, the KCC will approve workplans with lists of activities or projects and budget. The resident \nmission, in close collaboration with the MNE, will act as the KCC secretariat to smoothen the \n                                                \n9 Economic convergence occurs when two or more economies tend to reach a similar level of development and wealth. \nThe use of statistical and econometric techniques allows to measure the development or wealth gap between actual \nand potential development. \n10 ADB and the government finance KEEP on a parity principle in accordance with the MOU. On 30 April 2020, the \ngovernment transferred $877,000 to ADB\u2019s TASF-other sources. ADB matched this with an $877,000 contribution, \nfor a total of $1,754,000. The same parity financing applied to the previous phases of KEEP. \n ", " \n5 \nimplementation of projects and activities.
