Twelve services, including education, health services, and water supply and sanitation \n(WSS), were devolved by the Government of Pakistan to local governments in 2001. Devolution \nprovides  opportunities  to  improve  substandard  social  services  while,  at  the  same  time,  \nit presents major challenges in the face of limited capacity, local political priorities, and financing \nconstraints. The Government of Pakistan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  assistance  for  improving  governance,  capacity,  and  financing  of  devolved  social \nservices in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). A related project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA)1 was requested for the preparation of a feasibility study. The TA will build on \nlessons learned from previous and ongoing social sector investments of ADB and development \npartners, including the Decentralization Support Program, the Sindh Devolved Social Services \nProgram  (DSSP),  Punjab  DSSP,  public  resource  management  programs,  and  the  NWFP \nStructural Adjustment Credit I and II. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  NWFP is the second poorest province of Pakistan\u2019s four provinces. During 2001/02, \n46%2 of NWFP\u2019s population were below the poverty line and the literacy rate was at a low 38%. \nAlthough literacy rates and enrollment rates have improved, these are still marked by gender \ndisparities. The male literacy rate is about 57% while the female rate is 20%; the male primary \nnet enrollment rate is 62% while the female rate is 39%. Although there are indications that \nhealth  outcomes  improved  in  NWFP  between  1998  and  2002,  much  improvement  is  still \nneeded. The child mortality rate stands at 79 per 1,000 and the maternal mortality ratio is high \nat 300\u2013450 per 100,000. Access to piped water for domestic purposes in urban areas is 66%, \nwhile in rural areas only 23% of the population have piped water supply and another 11% have \naccess  to  community  taps.  In  a  participatory  poverty  assessment  study,3  poverty  and \nvulnerability in NWFP were identified with illiteracy, inadequate access to goods and public \nservices, social exclusion and stigma, remoteness and physical isolation, and insecurity and \nlack of peace, among others. \n \n3.   The pace of devolution implementation in NWFP has been slow. Education and health \nservices were devolved to district governments. At the district level, education and literacy \nconstitute one department while higher education is separate. In WSS, the functions have been \ndevolved to the urban tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) but not to rural ones. In addition, \nNWFP\u2019s Works and Services office has divided the province into six regions, each headed by a \nsuperintending  engineer.4  The  provincial  government  has  been  accused  of  interference  in \ndistrict affairs by district nazims, including in the appointment and transfer of personnel, partly \nfor political reasons and partly due to a murky definition of roles and responsibilities. Salaries \nremain within the provincial account and are thus effectively being paid by the province. Many \nproject  activities  for  the  districts  are  still  being  administered  by  the  provincial  government \nthrough so-called \u201cvertical programs.\u201d In terms of the budget, fiscal flows within the province are \nformula based (Provincial Finance Commission awards); however, the definition of deductions \nto  arrive  at  the  divisible  pool  for  the  districts  is  still  discretionary.  The  capacity  of  local \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 21 February 2005. \n2  World Bank. 2004.

The  Government  aims  to  improve  health indicators  over  the  medium  term.  \nThe government strategy consists of management and organizational reforms, programmatic \nreforms,  and  increasing  financial  allocations.  The  reforms  include  improving  management \nstructure  and  building  district  management  capacity,  reorganizing  health  facilities  into  a \nmultilevel referral system, focusing on preventive and primary health care, removing obvious \ngaps in facilities, providing budgetary allocations, and developing public-private partnerships \nwith adequate regulation.5 The implementation of programmatic reforms, e.g., malaria control, \nhas progressed while management and organizational reforms have lagged behind. Health \nmanagement and institutional reforms have been initiated. Policy and reform functions are now \nat the provincial level and service delivery is devolved to the districts. Autonomy has been \ngranted to tertiary hospitals. Rationalization and standardization plans are being implemented in \nseveral district hospitals. Public-private partnerships are being promoted. In addition, more lady \nhealth workers and female nurses have been recruited in district hospitals. Additional financial \nresources are required for the continued implementation of these reforms and the provision of \nsupport to districts to ensure effective implementation under the devolved setup. \n \n5.  Education. The education system is marked by gender disparities in enrollments and \nsuffers from issues such as teacher absenteeism, poor teaching quality, and poor facilities.  \nThis has resulted in low participation rates and high dropout rates. Lack of access is especially \na problem in remote areas, as schools remain closed due to lack of teachers; lack of school \ninfrastructure also remains an issue. Special efforts are needed to rationalize resources and \nthus improve the internal and external efficiency of the education system. Activities are under \nway to address these issues. In an effort to reduce teacher absenteeism and ensure staffing of \nschools, teachers are being hired on location-specific contracts. Communities are increasingly \nbecoming involved in school management, including monitoring teacher attendance and having \nspending authority on instructional materials and repairs. To address the large gap between \nboys\u2019 and girls\u2019 enrollment rates, more resources are being allocated to enrolling and keeping \ngirls in school, e.g., provision of free textbooks to girls enrolled in government primary schools \nand building new schools. Basic facilities and additional classrooms will be provided for the \ngrowing population. Upgradation of primary schools to middle schools and middle schools to \nhigh  schools  is  being  carried  out.  Higher  education  issues  also  need  to  be  addressed.  \nWith devolution, more resources are required to help districts increase access and deliver high-\nquality education. This includes developing more effective mechanisms for monitoring district \neducation outcomes and making accountable district-employed teachers.   \n \n6.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Safe drinking water facilities and services are a major \nconcern for the poor. Where facilities are present, systems may be nonfunctional as funds for \noperation and maintenance, including for electricity bills, are insufficient. In the absence of \naccess to piped water supply or community taps, water is obtained from hand pumps, wells,  \nor through private water vendors, who charge high prices. Private water vendors tend to operate \nin poorer areas, which translates into poorer people tending to pay higher prices for water. \nSome rural residents have to fetch water from distant sources as well. Water quality is poor due \nto an aging distribution system, lack of treatment facilities, lack of water-quality monitoring \nsystems, and contaminated water sources in urban areas. The demand for municipal and \nindustrial water will increase due to the combined effect of an increasing population and the \nneed for greater access to clean water for a healthier population. Ongoing activities to increase \naccess are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the province. Drainage and sanitation work \n                                                 \n5  World Bank. 2004. Program Document of the NWFP Second Structural Adjustment Credit  Washington, DC. \n ", "    3\nin the province is also limited. With devolution, TMAs, too, need capacity building and additional \nresources to effectively meet their responsibility to deliver safe drinking water. \n \n7.  Crosscutting  Features.  Under  devolution,  the  aim  is  for  local  governments  and \ncommunities to take responsibility for social services. Social service delivery must be viewed as \na cooperative venture among all levels of government, communities, and the private sector in \nsupport of low-cost quality services. District governments and TMAs need to build links with \ncommunities, especially community citizen boards. To effectively implement devolution of social \nservice  delivery,  the  macro  issues  include:  (i) improving  linkages  between  the  provincial \ngovernment  and  local  governments  to  manage  social  sector  policy  reforms,  and  provide \ntechnical support and monitoring; (ii) streamlining provincial political and administrative forces to \nbenefit the public; and (iii) ensuring the efficiency of additional resources and accountability. \nThese would entail (i) enhancing local governments\u2019 capacity to plan and manage the social \nsector; (ii) putting in place mechanisms for more sustainable social sector financing and efficient \nspending;  (iii) increasing  community  control  over  services  and  staff;  and  (iv) supporting \nprovincial line departments with clear roles and improved linkages. Social sector development \ndepends  on  the  leadership  capacity  at  district  and  community  levels;  the  relationship  of \nprovincial, nazim, and district coordination officers; competent staff; and financial resources for \noperations.  \n \n8.  External  Financing.  The  World  Bank  is  providing  assistance  to  NWFP  in  health, \neducation, and rural WSS, and  supporting policy reforms through its structural adjustment \ncredits. Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) is providing assistance in \neducation and health. The United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Essential Institutional \nReforms Operationalisation Programme provided capacity-building support to elected officials. \nThe Government of the United Kingdom, through the Department for International Development, \nis  proposing  to  provide  \u00a3150  million  over  5  years  to  create  fiscal  space  for  social  sector \nspending,  particularly  in  education.  At  present,  ADB  is  supporting  the  implementation  of \ndevolution in NWFP through the Decentralized Support Program (DSP). Technical assistance in \nDSP provides capacity-building inputs with focus on governance and gender. ADB assistance to \nthe social sectors in NWFP is being provided through projects in education, health, and WSS.  \nIn light of ongoing and proposed assistance in the social sectors of NWFP, ADB\u2019s assistance \nwill be coordinated to avoid overlap with assistance provided by other development partners.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.   The objective of the TA is to assist the NWFP provincial government (NPG) prepare a \nprogram of reforms, to be financed by a program loan, to make devolved social services more \neffective, efficient, equitable, and sustainable. In turn, this should have major benefits for the \npoor in health, education, and WSS. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nThe TA will have the following outputs: (i) situation analysis, (ii) recommendations for reform in \nthe social sectors, (iii) program loan design, (iv) capacity-building and program implementation \nsupport design, and (v) completion of some first tranche actions.  \n \n10.  The TA will plan a program of reforms for NWFP that targets the poor and is province-\nwide, demand driven, and performance based. All districts and TMAs in NWFP will be assisted \nfor about 3 to 4 years, with an emphasis on cost-effective services that will benefit many people, \nin particular the poor and women. While the program will be sector-wide, its design will ensure \nthat the activities will be in line with government priorities.   ", "4   \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  TA  implementation  will  be  in  two  phases:  (i) preparing  the  program  loan  and \n(ii) supporting first tranche actions. The first phase will (i) conduct a comprehensive analysis of \nthe current situation in light of local government ordinances and other government directives, \nand assistance from development partners and assess the progress of ongoing policy reforms \nin the social sectors; (ii) identify and recommend social sector reforms required and/or to be \nstrengthened, in order to improve social service delivery under devolution and to be supported \nby  a  program  loan;  (iii) identify  program-related  activities  to  assist  provincial  social  sector \ndepartments  support  local  governments;  and  (iv) design  project  activities  to  help  local \ngovernments improve the quality of social services, build local capacity for service delivery, \ndevelop and support public-private partnerships, and support improvements to make the social \nsector  more  effective,  efficient,  equitable,  and  sustainable.  The  second  phase  will  support \nactivities leading to the completion of some first tranche actions in the proposed program loan\u2019s \npolicy matrix that would have been agreed upon by the national Government. \n  \n12.  Support will be provided for health, education, and WSS, with crosscutting support for \nrelated  activities  such  as  in  poverty  reduction,  community  participation,  and  gender  in \ndevelopment  (See  Appendix  2  for  the  Summary  of  Initial  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis).  \nThe specialists, led by the governance and institutional development specialist, will develop a \npolicy matrix to ensure district- and TMA-level capacity to deliver social services. The poverty, \ngender, and participation specialist and sector specialists will develop a selection of activities to \nreinforce capacity building to strengthen social service delivery. For example, in education, the \nprogram may support activities to improve the quality of education and enrollment. In health and \npopulation welfare, the scope may include support to implement health sector reforms and \nimprove facilities. In WSS, support may be extended to developing cost-effective water-quality \nmonitoring mechanisms, increasing coverage and minimum standards, and strengthening TMA \ncapacity for planning, developing, and managing WSS and solid waste management services. \nADB financing for the proposed program may follow one of several design modalities, and the \nspecialists will review ongoing government, ADB, and other externally funded programs and \nprojects to indicate how the proposed program will complement and build on ongoing efforts.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which $15,000 will be the \nforeign exchange cost and $585,000 equivalent will be the local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$450,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $435,000 equivalent \nin local currency cost. The remaining $150,000 will be contributed by the Government and will \ninclude  office  accommodation,  utilities,  transport,  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  and \nadministration support. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government has been informed that ADB's financing \nof the TA does not commit ADB to financing a subsequent loan project. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  Planning  and  Development  Department  (P&DD),  NWFP,  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency for the TA. A steering committee will be established to provide overall guidance to the \nTA  team.  The  committee,  chaired  by  the  Additional  Chief  Secretary,  P&DD,  will  comprise \nrepresentatives from the departments of finance, schools and literacy, higher education, health, \npopulation  welfare,  local  government,  works  and  services,  and  public  health  engineering;  \n ", "    5\nfour  representatives  from  district  governments  and  TMAs;  and  two  nongovernment \nrepresentatives. At least two members will be female. The committee will be established before \nthe start of the TA. The committee will meet at least twice in the first 3 months and at least once \nin the next 2 months to monitor the TA. It will provide guidance, establish ownership by NPG, \nensure that the design maximizes the development impact for the poor, and support the ensuing \nloan processing, if any. NPG will appoint a focal person before TA signing. The focal person will \nalso attend the meetings of the steering committee. All concerned departments will designate \ncounterpart  staff  to  work  on  a  part-time  basis  with  the  consultants.  P&DD  will  provide \nadministrative support. NPG will provide adequate office space in the P&DD after TA signing. \nThe office will have utilities, furniture, and local telephone services. The consulting firm will \nprocure equipment, software, and furniture, as necessary, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. The equipment, software, and furniture will be transferred to the government \nupon TA completion.  \n \n15.  The TA will employ the services of consultants for a total of 45 person-months. In view of \nthe capacity and availability of domestic consultants who are knowledgeable about the details of \ndevolution and the social sectors, consulting services will be procured locally. The first phase of \nTA implementation will require 27 person-months of consulting services. The experts will include \na governance and institutional development specialist and team leader (5 person-months); a \npublic finance/economics specialist and co-team leader (5 person-months); an education sector \nspecialist (3 person-months); health and population welfare sector specialist (3 person-months); \na water supply and sanitation sector specialist (3 person-months); an environmental specialist \n(1 person-month); a public-private partnership specialist (4 person-months); and a poverty, \ngender, and participation specialist (3 person-months). The remaining consulting services for \nthe second phase of TA implementation will be identified after the completion of the first phase. \nADB  will  engage  a  consulting  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nThe simplified technical proposal will be used. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.   \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months; the first phase will be from \nSeptember 2005 to February 2006, and the second phase will be from June to August 2006. \nThe team will submit an inception report within a month of TA commencement, a preliminary \nreport of the situation analysis and initial policy matrix within 3 months, the draft final report in \nmonth 4, and the final report within 6 months from the start of the TA. The government of NWFP \nand ADB will comment on the draft final report. The TA will include field visits, stakeholder \nmapping, and institutional mapping; and employ participatory methods to ensure consultation \nwith a wide range of stakeholders, including parents, teachers, health staff, community water \nboards, and political and administrative leaders at various levels. The consultants will organize \nat least four district workshops and one provincial workshop in Peshawar involving stakeholders \nto solicit and discuss views and recommendations, and discuss options and activities.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the North-West Frontier Province Devolved Social \nServices Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \n  Mechanism  and Risks \n   \n       \nImpact      Assumptions \nStrengthen devolved  \u2022 Primary net  \u2022 Pakistan Integrated  \u2022 Program loan design is \nsocial services for more  enrollment rates  Household Survey  implemented effectively. \neffective, equitable,  increase  \u2022 Multiple Indicators  \u2022 Government commitment to \nefficient, and sustainable  \u2022 Infant mortality rate  Cluster Survey  improving social service \ndelivery of social  falls     delivery within a devolved \nservices in line with LGO   \u2022 Total fertility rate falls  system is continued.  \n      WSS coverage   \n      increases   \n \n \n       \nOutcome      Assumption \nProgram loan design and  \u2022 Memorandum of  \u2022 TA review mission aide- \u2022 There is continued political \ncapacity-building support  understanding signed  memoires and BTORs  will and commitment to \nagreed to by  by Government and  \u2022 Memorandum of  institutionalize devolved LG \nGovernment and ADB  ADB during appraisal  understanding  system \nmission in 2006 or   \naide-m\u00e9moire  Risk \nconfirmed after  \u2022 Federal, NWFP, and local \nappraisal mission  government\u2019s priorities \n  change or take time to be \nconfirmed after newly \nelected local officials are \nsworn into office \n \n \n       \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

During \n2001/02, 46% of NWFP\u2019s population were below the poverty line and the literacy rate was at a low 38%. \nAlthough literacy rates and enrollment rates have improved, these are still marked by gender disparities. \nThe male literacy rate is about 57% while the female is 20%; the male net primary enrollment rate is 62% \nwhile the female is 39%. Although there are indications that health outcomes improved in NWFP between \n1998 and 2002, much more improvement is needed. Only 22% of currently married women aged 15\u201349 \nyears use contraceptive methods, and immunization rates for children are low at 57%. Access to piped \nwater for domestic purposes in the urban areas is 66% while in rural areas, only 23% of the population \nhave piped water supply and another 11% have access to community taps. In a participatory poverty \nassessment study, poverty and vulnerability in NWFP were identified with illiteracy, inadequate access to \ngoods and public services, social exclusion and stigma, remoteness and physical isolation, and lack of \npeace and insecurity, among others. \n \nThe  federal  Government  has  made  as  one  of  its  four  core  principles  the  improvement  of  human \ndevelopment  outcomes.  The  Government  has  undertaken  federal  reform  programs  in  health  and \neducation, and the provincial governments have taken steps to improve governance and decentralization \nof government. Government efforts for devolution and decentralization present a unique opportunity to \nimprove  social  sector  outcomes  by  improving  efficiency  in  resource  allocation,  and  by  encouraging \ninnovation in public-private partnership.

The  situation  analysis  will  include  descriptions  of  the \ncharacteristics of the poor in the context of NWFP; identification of districts with concentrations of the poor; \nreview  and  assessment  of  service  delivery  systems  (health,  education,  and  water  and  sanitation), \nparticularly in rural areas; constraints faced by the poor in access to services; capacity of the service \nproviders/institutions;  and  service  providers\u2019  attitude  toward  the  poor.
