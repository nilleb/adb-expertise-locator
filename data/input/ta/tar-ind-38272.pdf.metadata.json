It has a population of 8.4 million, 25% of \nwhom live in urban areas. The government of Uttaranchal (GOU) views urban development as one \nof its growth pillars supporting its lead economic sector of tourism as well as the key to achieving \nthe  millennium  development  goals.  Accordingly,  GOU  has  set  a  vision  of  enhancing  living \nstandards, productivity, and sustainability of all cities and towns while securing the cultural and \nenvironmental heritage. GOU\u2019s strategy to realize this vision involves investments in basic urban \ninfrastructure and services. The strategy also commits itself to enhanced roles and powers for \nurban local bodies (ULBs) with concurrent measures to strengthen local capacities. GOU recently \ncommitted  considerable  funds  for  a  feasibility  study  for  urban  infrastructure  and  services \ndevelopment, and requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to support its feasibility \nwork. The Government and ADB agreed that technical assistance1 (TA) would be provided in 2005.  \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission visited Delhi and Uttaranchal State during 10-15 April 2005 to \nformulate  the  TA  for  preparing  the  Uttaranchal  Urban  Development  Project.  The  Mission  met \nrepresentatives of the central Government, GOU, and ULBs. Field visits were made to several \ntowns. From discussions with the stakeholders and a review of related documents and experience \nof ADB\u2019s earlier assistance in India, the Mission reached an understanding with the Government on \n(i) the division of tasks between GOU and ADB in preparing the proposed project; and (ii) the \nobjective, scope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference of the \nconsultants under the TA. The preliminary design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Uttaranchal is located on the northern boundary of India, and shares borders with Nepal and \nthe People\u2019s Repubic of China. Over 90% of the state\u2019s terrain is classified as hilly, and 62% is \nforests, limiting the accessibility and availability of land for agriculture. However, the state has great \npotential for tourism with its pristine and picturesque environment, mountains and rivers, pilgrimage \nsites,  national  parks,  hill  stations  wildlife,  and  historical  sites.  Tourism  is  the  mainstay  of  the \neconomy and a major source of employment, with annual tourist arrivals reaching almost three \ntimes the state population and contributing to the 5% annual growth of the state\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct.  \n \n4.  About 2.1 million people of Uttaranchal\u2019s population live in 63 designated urban areas. \nUrban growth is rapid with a decadal growth rate of about 33%, much higher than the state \npopulation growth rate of 19%. Urbanization rates vary across the state. The northern part of the \nstate is less urbanized than the south and southwest districts where trade, commerce, transport, \nand diversification of economy gave rise to the town\u2019s growth and the more urbanized regions. \nDehradun is the largest city with a population of about 450,000. Two towns have populations above \n100,000, while 17 have populations between 20,000 and 100,000. The remaining 30% of the urban \npopulation live in towns with populations of less than 20,000. Regardless of the population size, \nmany of these urban areas are major tourism destinations or the gateways to other tourist spots, \nand experience significant seasonal population increases. These towns are also centers of agro-\nindustry, trade, and commerce. Given the low potential for agricultural growth, urban areas where \ntourism and nonagricultural economy can flourish present great opportunities for Uttaranchal\u2019s \ndevelopment.  \n \n5.  However,  the  potential  role  that  urban  areas  can  play  in  the  state\u2019s  development  is \nsignificantly  constrained  by  deficiencies  in  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services  and  poor \nenvironmental  conditions.  The  overall  shortfall  in  water  supply  exceeds  50%  due  partly  to \ninadequate sources and distribution and partly to leakage from old and dilapidated pipelines. The \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 20 April 2005.    \n ", "2   \ndifficulty of creating water storage reservoirs in hilly towns further contributes to inadequate supply. \nService level is poor, with water available for only 2-6 hours per day. Less than 20% of the urban \npopulation is served by sewerage networks. Because sewage is generally disposed off without \nappropriate treatment into lakes and water bodies that also serve as sources of drinking water, \npublic health problems are significant. More than 50% of the urban solid waste generated is not \ncollected; the problem is compounded during the tourist season when the quantum of solid waste \nincreases manifold, straining the already limited capacities in solid waste management. Urban \nroads are in poor condition, and road networks and parking spaces are insufficient to meet the \ndemands of the current traffic volume that has doubled over the past 10 years. The hilly terrain \nwithout adequate storm water drainage leads to severe erosion that causes environmental damage \nand threatens the stability of roads. These deficiencies particularly affect the poor and impact on the \nquality of their life. It is estimated that 10-25% of the urban population live in slums. The initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \n6.  Inadequate urban institutional and financial frameworks and capacities are the major cause \nof the prevailing poor environmental conditions and lack of sustainability in urban service delivery. \nThe responsibility for providing infrastructure and services (except water and sewerage), including \non-site  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  road  maintenance,  street  lighting,  and  slum \nimprovement  lies  with  ULBs.  However,  ULBs  cannot  effectively  perform  their  duties  as  they \ngenerally lack the required skills, appropriate management tools, and efficient working culture. \nWhile GOU has taken some steps2 to implement the 74th Constitutional Amendment (CA), which \nprovides  the  requisite  enabling  framework  for  decentralized  urban  governance,  most  of  the \nprovisions of the CA are not yet operational in the state. ULBs depend, to a large extent, on grants \nand aid from the state, which itself suffers from massive deficits. Currently, ULBs generate only 15-\n55% of their total income. In many cases, own source income together with state transfers is not \nsufficient to meet the salary and establishment cost. The current revenue base is too limited. There \nare no matching sources of funds for many ULB functions, e.g., road maintenance. The property \ntax, a major source of local revenue, falls short of its full potential due to inadequate assessment, \nincomplete coverage of the tax net, and low collection efficiencies. Current solid waste collection \ncharges that are based on a percentage of the property tax are inadequate to meet the cost of the \nservice. The task of meeting the service needs of a large seasonal tourist population places an \nextra financial burden on ULBs in the absence of any direct revenues accruing to ULBs from \ntourism. Furthermore, ULBs lack credible accounting, financial reporting, and budgeting systems to \nefficiently manage their scarce resources. These capacity constraints coupled with a lack of an \nenabling framework also impact on the ability to outsource urban service delivery to the private \nsector.   \n \n7.  Two statutory bodies are involved in urban water supply and sewerage. Uttaranchal Pey Jal \nNigam (UPJN) is responsible for the construction of water supply and sewerage systems, while \nUttaranchal  Jal  Sanstan  (UJS)  is  in  charge  of  operating  and  maintaining  water  supply  and \nsewerage facilities in urban and rural areas. However, sustainability of water supply and sanitation \nis  in  question  due  to  high  operating  ratios  (1.59),  high  production  costs,  and  poor  asset \nmanagement. High administrative costs, system losses of 30-50%, and additional costs of pumping \nwater in hilly terrain contribute to high production costs. Sewerage and water tariffs are low. Water \ncharge is no more than one fourth of water production cost, and does not consider replacement \ncosts. Metering is used only for the commercial sector and does not cover domestic users. State \nallocations made to UJS\u2019s budget for capital works and maintenance are reportedly used to meet \nthe salary bill of a large establishment, leaving insufficient funds for operation and maintenance.  \n \n                                                 \n2 The municipal law is prepared. GOU formed the State Finance Commission which prepared a report on assessment of \nand recommendations for enhancing the ULBs\u2019 fiscal situation in line with the 74th CA. The Department of Urban \nDevelopment initiated master planning for all towns. ULBs\u2019 computerization is ongoing. Hardware for a geographic \ninformation systems (GIS) was installed, and staff training on GIS is about to begin.    \n ", "  3\n8.  Despite  its  overwhelming  investment  needs,  Uttaranchal  to  date  has  not  received  any \nexternal assistance for urban development. ADB\u2019s urban sector assistance has focused on other \nstates. Since 1995, ADB has provided eight loans to the urban sector in India. The strategic thrust \nof ADB\u2019s assistance has been poverty reduction through shared growth, social development, and \ngood governance. These objectives have been translated into action by mostly integrated urban \ninfrastructure and services projects. Past experience reveals the issues of (i) delays in project \nimplementation  especially  during  project  start-up,  and  (ii)  sustainability  of  project  assets.  The \nexperience suggests that up-front support for building capacities for project management has the \npotential to prevent project start-up delays. The experience also implies that greater care is needed \nto  ensure  sustainability  by  building  the  capacities  of  ULBs  and  supporting  the  process  of \ndecentralization. A performance-oriented approach to town selection and mechanisms to enhance \nownership of the project by the state and ULBs are also likely to help improve sustainability. \n \n9.  Recently, growing regional disparities in India have become a concern to ADB and the \nGovernment  in  the  context  of  the  common  core  objective  of  poverty  reduction. ADB  made  a \ncommitment to diversify its operations to the northern states. Uttaranchal has been identified as one \nof the geographic areas of priority for ADB assistance.3 Developing the urban areas in Uttaranchal \nwill help utilize optimally existing urban potentials for the attainment of the Government\u2019s target of \nredressing regional imbalances and GOU\u2019s vision of improved quality of life for urban residents and \nenhanced state economy, especially tourism. There is need to improve basic urban infrastructure \nand services in Uttaranchal. Further, physical investments need to be combined with additional \ninterventions to overhaul institutional and financial frameworks, develop local capacities, promote \nprivate sector participation, and mobilize local resources for sustainable service delivery in line with \nthe spirit of the 74th CA. Moreover, all these interventions need to be accompanied by efforts to \naddress the capacity weaknesses in project management as a priority activity based on past \nexperience. GOU showed its commitment to and demonstrated its capacity by initiating project \npreparation for Uttaranchal urban development. The TA is required to complement GOU\u2019s project \npreparation activities to help meet ADB\u2019s due diligence and policy requirements, and to strengthen \nthe project management capacity of GOU and ULBs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The objectives of the TA are twofold: (i) to support GOU in preparing a project suitable for \nADB financing that will improve the urban environment and living conditions of urban residents\u2013\nespecially the poor\u2013and enhance economic growth, and (ii) to strengthen the project management \nand  implementation  capacity  of  state  agencies,  ULBs,  and  utilities  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of the investment project. The ensuing investment project is expected to blend \nurban infrastructure and services improvements with interventions for urban policy and institutional \nreforms and capacity building for sustainable urban service delivery. \n \n11.  The TA will have two phases \u2013 phase 1 will be dedicated to support the determination of the \nfeasibility of an investment package, and phase 2 will focus on activities to improve the project \nmanagement capacities of relevant agencies. Since GOU is already in the lead in designing an \ninvestment project, use of a sector loan modality will be adopted for the investment project. This \nmodality will (i) provide a planned approach by placing the project in a wider sector development \ncontext with a long-term sector investment plan and agenda for urban policy, and institutional and \nfinancial reforms; (ii) ensure flexibility in undertaking an investment program in multiple towns, \naddressing the towns\u2019 real demands; and (iii) have the potential to a promote performance-oriented \napproach in town selection.      \n                                                 \n3  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program includes a loan for Uttaranchal Power Sector Development Project in 2005, and \nanother loan for Uttaranchal State Roads Project in 2006, in addition to the loan for Uttaranchal Urban Development \nProject in 2007.  \n ", "4   \n12.  The outputs of phase 1 will include (i) an investment project suitable for financing by ADB \nwith  a  representative  set  of  urban  infrastructure  subprojects  together  with  the  criteria  and \nmethodology  for  developing  and  appraising  further  subprojects;  (ii)  detailed  feasibility  studies \nincluding  assessment  of  the  social,  economic,  financial,  and  environmental  viability  and \nsustainability of the selected subprojects, and implementation arrangements for the loan project; \nand (iii) an agreed-upon urban policy and institutional reform agenda, together with a program of \ncapacity building for sector institutions including ULBs and utilities. Outputs from phase 2 will be \nenhanced project management capacities with competent project management unit (PMU) and \nproject implementation units (PIUs) and consequent smooth project implementation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  Phase 1 of the TA will assist GOU in preparing the investment project. As GOU will take \ncharge of preparing the feasibility of the investment plan and subprojects, the TA consultants will \nreview, complement, and, as required, augment the study prepared by GOU to have a project \nsuitable for ADB financing. More specifically, the TA will review and confirm (i) the criteria and \nprocedures for including the towns in the ensuing sector loan project; (ii) assessments of urban \ninfrastructure and services requirements and institutional, regulatory, and financial frameworks for \nplanning and managing urban infrastructure and services; (iii) investment proposals and indication \nof  procurement  packages  for  the  first  batch  of  towns  to  be  included  in  the  loan  project  and \nsubprojects,  together  with  feasibility  assessments;  (iv)  reform  proposals  to  promote \ndecentralization,  especially  enhanced  urban  revenue  generation  and  financial  management  of \nULBs,  efficiency  and  self-sufficiency  of  utilities,  and  a  program  of  capacity  building;  and  (v) \nproposals  for  creating  an  enabling  framework  and  workable  modalities  for  private  sector \nparticipation in urban infrastructure and services delivery. The TA will also prepare frameworks for \nsafeguarding the environment, plans for resettlement and indigenous peoples, and other related \nplans.  The  TA  will  further  assist  GOU  in  following  a  participatory  approach  in  preparing  the \ninvestment project.    \n \n14.  The TA consultants will review the assessments and reports prepared by GOU upon the \nstart of their respective assignments. They will review ADB and GOU policies and guidelines as \nthey apply to particular areas. Meetings with GOU will be arranged during inception to obtain an \noverview of the thrust and approach of GOU in relation to project preparation. The inception report \nwill reflect the approach and activities for the duration of the project as well as towns ranking and \ntowns proposed for inclusion in the investment project based on agreed-upon criteria. The TA \nconsultant will produce a report consolidating GOU\u2019s feasibility and all the analyses and information \nnecessary to prepare the project for ADB financing and scoping work.    \n \n15.  Phase 2 will include (i) development of project management systems and procedures, (ii) \nassistance in establishing PMU and PIUs with optimal managerial and technical personnel structure \nand  skills,  (iii)  training  of  staff  in  ADB  procedures  and  basic  project  management  and \nimplementation skills, and (iv) hands-on assistance in project start-up activities and preparations for \nimplementing the urban reform agenda linked to the investment project.     \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent comprising $302,000 in foreign \nexchange and $448,000 equivalent in local currency. The foreign exchange cost and $298,000 \nequivalent in local currency, totaling $600,000, will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. GOU will provide $150,000 equivalent to cover the remuneration of counterpart \nstaff, provision of office accommodation and facilities, local transportation for counterpart staff, and \nfunds for workshop facilities. The Government of India has been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing loan project. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing arrangements are in Appendix 3. \n   \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Department of Urban Development (DUD) of GOU will be the Executing Agency (EA) \nfor the TA. DUD is considered suitable as EA as it is the focal body for urban development \nprograms, environmental management, and coordination of ULBs and development authorities. \nDUD is also responsible for urban policy making, urban legislation, and capacity building of ULBs.  \nDUD with an appropriately skilled staff of 10 will oversee the TA activities and coordinate with other \nrelevant agencies, particularly with the Department of Drinking Water Supply and UJPN and UJS. \nDUD has already appointed a qualified project director experienced in ADB projects. The project \ndirector will be supported by an adequate number of professional and support staff. DUD will \nprovide  the  consultants  with  administrative  and  technical  support  and  logistics.  A  core  TA \nCoordination Committee will be formed and have monthly meetings to give to the TA inputs from \nthe key sector departments, including urban development, drinking water supply, and finance. GOU \nwill  also  form  a  TA  steering  committee/empowered  committee,  chaired  by  the  state\u2019s  chief \nsecretary,  consisting  of  the  secretaries  of  all  concerned  state  departments  and  ULB \nrepresentatives. The Committee will meet to review TA progress and guide on policy issues at key \nstages, at least three times: at inception, midterm, and draft final stage. \n \n18.  The TA will be undertaken by two teams of international and domestic consultants to be \nengaged as individuals in two consecutive stages in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nAbout  45  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  the  two  phases\u2013    nine \ninternational and 36 domestic. The TA team for the phase 1 will comprise international experts \n(person-months are in parenthesis) in urban development and municipal engineering acting as a \nteam leader (4), an economist (2), a financial analyst/utility-municipal finance specialist (2), and a \nprivate sector participation specialist (1). The team for phase 1 will also include domestic experts \n(13)  in  water  supply  and  sanitation,  environment,  social  development,  urban  planning,  and \ngovernance and institutional development. The TA team for phase 2 will comprise domestic experts \n(23):  one  for  project  management  acting  as  team  leader,  and  experts  in  procurement/civil \nengineering, and financial management and urban governance. Outline terms of reference for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 4.  \n \n19.  Phase 1 will be implemented over 6 months from September 2005 to March 2006. The \nconsultants will submit an inception report, including the approach, scope, work program, and towns \nselection together with criteria and methodology, within 1 month; an interim report containing an \nassessment of towns\u2019 needs and urban policy and institutions and preliminary project proposals \nwithin 4 months; and a draft final report comprising the feasibility and investment package within 6 \nmonths of the start of the TA. Tripartite meetings will be held with GOU, ADB, and the consultants \nto discuss reports. Workshops will also be held to discuss the interim and draft final reports with \nstakeholders. A final report will be submitted 1 month after the Government and ADB comment on \nthe draft report. The start of phase 2 of the TA will be subject to timing of the loan fact-finding \nmission. The TA will be implemented over 1 year with inception, interim, and final reports to be \nsubmitted by the end of the second, seventh, and twelfth months, respectively. Equipment provided \nunder  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nProcurement and will be handed over to DUD upon completion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of India for preparing the Uttaranchal Urban Development Project, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/  Data Sources   Assumptions and \nIndicators  Reporting Mechanism  Risks \nImpact        Assumption \nSustainable improvements to the  City environment and public  Central and state  \u2022 The Government is \nliving conditions of city residents  health improved   government statistics  committed to \nand enhanced productivity by  Poverty incidence reduced    sustainable urban \nimproving urban infrastructure  Growth of tourist arrivals at  Reports of  bilateral and  development in \nand services and promoting  12%  multilateral organizations     Uttaranchal. \nrobust urban reforms, financial  Sustainable urban service  Risk \nsustainability, and capacity  delivery due to enhanced  \u2022 The 74th CA is not fully \nbuilding for sector institutions  management and financial  operational in the state. \ncapacities  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved urban environment and  By 2010:  Monitoring against project  \u2022 GOU is committed to \npublic health by improving urban  Increased percentage of  baseline surveys on service  implement 74th CA and \ninfrastructure and services   urban population with access  access in the towns and  other necessary \n(i)  Water supply and sewerage  to quality water supply and  sector-specific secondary  reforms to develop \n(ii)  Solid waste management  adequate water resources,  data on service levels   ULBs\u2019 institutional and \n(iii) Storm water drainage  sewerage/ proper on-site  Periodic project progress  financial capacities. \n(iv) Roads and parking spaces  sanitation, solid waste  reports  \u2022 ULBs willing to \n(v)  Slum upgrading   management  Project completion report  undertake reforms for \n   Increased percentage of  Independent monitoring by  efficiency and \n  urban poor households with  third parties (civil society  appropriate pricing of \n  access to basic infrastructure  and nongovernment  services \n  and services   organizations in slums  \u2022 Willingness by urban \n  Improved operation and  residents to connect to \n  maintenance  the systems and pay \n    for tariffs, charges, and \nRobust urban reforms and  Sustainable sources of funds  fees for improved \nenhanced institutional and  for urban service delivery and  services exist  \nfinancial capacities to plan,  improved financial  Risk \ndevelop, operate, and maintain  management practices in  \u2022 Delay in implementing \nurban infrastructure and services  place   the project and the \non a sustainable basis      reform agenda \n    \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Yes  partnership agreement?  Yes \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in India:   \n \nThe Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, presented in the 10th Plan of 2002, sets a high growth target of 8% to induce \nrapid reduction in income poverty and attain ambitious human development goals. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) prepared in 2003 supports the 10th Plan and rests its poverty reduction assistance on \nthe three pillars of pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. CSP regards urban development as one of \nthe major operational instruments to achieve the social development pillar in an inclusive manner. The technical assistance \n(TA) which aims to prepare an investment project for urban infrastructure and services, will contribute to inclusive social \ndevelopment by (i) focusing on Uttaranchal, which is identified in the CSP as a priority state for addressing the concerns of \ninterregional disparities; and (ii) increasing access of the urban population, especially the poor, to basic infrastructure and \nservices. A preliminary assessment of the current situation in Uttaranchal urban areas reveals the poor quality of the urban \nenvironment and deficiencies in service provision that undermine the public health and well-being. The ensuing project that \nis expected to include basic services such as water supply, sanitation, and waste management will contribute to human \ndevelopment,  public  health  improvements,  and  enhanced  productivity.  The  impact  on  the  poor  through  citywide \nimprovements will be reinforced further through targeted interventions such as slum improvement programs that the ensuing \nproject is likely to include.  \n \n \nB. Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nPoverty and social analysis will be carried out to determine the socioeconomic profile of the population, urban poverty \nincidence, the nature and characteristics of poverty, and perceived priorities of the poor.     \n \nThe poverty analysis will track potential adverse effects over the short, medium, and long term for the poor and excluded \ngroups. It will review options to eliminate such negative effects through design changes, or mitigate them through specific \nmitigating measures to be included in the project design and costed as part of the total project cost. The poverty analysis will \nalso review options to extend or enhance the benefits for the poor and excluded through design changes in the scope and/or \npace of the policy conditions.   \n \n \nC.
