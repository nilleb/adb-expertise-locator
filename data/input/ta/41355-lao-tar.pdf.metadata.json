The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) seeks to achieve \neconomic growth, reduce poverty, and graduate from its least-developed-country status by 2020. \nThe National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), approved by the National \nAssembly in October 2003, provides a broad strategic framework that emphasizes the need to \nbuild capacity at all levels of public administration, and particularly to improve public financial \nmanagement (PFM), to achieve the socially inclusive development goals laid out in the sixth \nNational Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) and the NGPES.1 To strengthen its PFM \ncapacity in line with the country\u2019s policy and development priorities, the Government has lodged \nits  reform  strategy  in  the  5-year  Public  Expenditure  Management  Strengthening  Program \n(PEMSP), which it adopted in November 2005. The strategic objective of the PEMSP is to \nimprove the efficient use of public resources and to strengthen the overall transparency of and \naccountability  for  public  spending.  The  2007  Public  Expenditure  Review  and  Integrated \nFiduciary Assessment underlined the importance of efficient public expenditure management \n(PEM) in meeting the Government\u2019s poverty reduction goals.2  \n2.  At the Government\u2019s request, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) intends to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to support the Government in improving its PEM. 3 The proposed TA \nconforms  to  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  2007\u20132011  for  the  Lao  PDR,4 which \nemphasizes  good  governance  through  policy  and  institutional  development  to  achieve \nsustainable  economic  growth.  A  Fact-Finding  Mission  to  Vientiane  from  30  January  to \n4 February  2008  discussed  and  reached  an  understanding  with  representatives  of  the \nGovernment on the TA objectives, scope, cost, and implementation arrangements. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  For the Government to succeed in implementing the NGPES and the NSEDP, it will \nhave  to  mobilize  resources  effectively  and  allocate  them  efficiently.  Given  the  close  links \nbetween policy and resources in PEM, ADB has provided institutional support to the Lao PDR \nsince 1998,5 particularly the accounting department under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). ADB \nhas helped develop and implement improved government accounting regulations, as well as a \n                                                 \n1 PFM  comprises  all  the  upstream  (preparation  and  programming)  and  downstream  components  (execution, \naccounting, control, reporting, monitoring, and evaluation) of budgeting, together with the legal and organizational \nframework  and  arrangements.  PFM  systems  also  include  revenue  management  and  are  often  used \ninterchangeably with PEM systems. \n2  World Bank, International Monetary Fund, ADB, and European Union. 2007. Lao PDR: Public Expenditure Review, \nIntegrated Fiduciary Assessment. Washington, DC.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 3 March 2008. \n4  ADB. 2006. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: Country  Strategy and Program 2007-2011. Manila. \n5  Several TA projects\u2014ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Establishing \nthe National Audit Office. Manila (TA 2987-LAO); ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic for Institutional Strengthening of the National Audit Office. Manila (TA 3771-LAO); ADB. 2003. Technical \nAssistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Enhancing Government Accounting Regulations and \nProcedures Phase II. Manila (TA 4180-LAO); ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic for Public Expenditure Planning for National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy. Manila (TA 4627-\nLAO); and ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Improved Public \nFinancial Management Systems. Manila (TA 4954-LAO)\u2014are now being implemented to (i) extend the coverage of \nthe government financial information system to 38 districts in the municipalities of Luang Prabang, Champassak, \nand Vientiane; and (ii) formulate a strategy and pilot-test the first-ever consolidated statement of financial position \nof the Government. \n ", "2 \ndatabase management system (the government financial information system, or GFIS), which \nautomates the capture of data consistent with a standardized chart of accounts and facilitates \nmore timely budget report preparation.6 ADB also supported the creation of the State Audit \nOrganization (SAO) and later the drafting of the Audit Law in 2006, which made the SAO \nindependent from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and mandated it to report its audit findings and \naudit opinions to the National Assembly, the President of the Lao PDR, and the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice. The Nam Theun 2 Revenue Management Arrangements (NT2 RMA) were based on that \nearly ADB assistance.7  \n4.  Since the PEMSP was first implemented in 2005, the Government has made steady \nprogress in putting in place a sound PEM framework. A new Organic Law was passed in \nNovember 2006 and the MOF was reorganized to deal with the newly centralized departments \nof customs, tax, and treasury. The GFIS is being upgraded to identify, track, and monitor budget \nexecution, and track expenditure. The Government will thus be able to manage its budgetary \nresources more effectively and with greater transparency. The new chart of accounts, consistent \nwith  the  IMF  Government  Financial  Statistics  and  international  public  sector  accounting \nstandards, is expected to be used for the FY2008 budget. With the Medium-Term Expenditure \nFramework (MTEF) and Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) models, developed with ADB \nTA support, the budgeting framework has been strengthened.8    \n5.  Under  TA  4627,  a  strategy  and  a  manual  for  an  MTEF  for  all  line  ministries  and \nprovinces  and  indicative  MTEFs  for  the  education  and  health  subsectors  (e.g.,  primary \neducation and expansion of rural health infrastructure) were prepared. The MTEF process, \nthough firmly anchored in budget preparation and the aggregate spending ceiling (derived from \nthe MTFF), will improve fiscal planning and budgeting only over the medium term (through \nspending that is better aligned with NSEDP objectives and is more cost-effective). But it has yet \nto become operational.  \n6.  Despite all the ADB support, however, aligning public expenditure policies with pro-poor \nNSEDP priorities remains a challenge for Lao PDR. Besides severe capacity constraints, the \nGovernment lacks realistic fiscal forecasts, a mechanism for ensuring that provincial budgets \nreflect  national  priorities,  a  unified  budget  process  (rather  than  fragmented  budgeting,  by \ninstitution and by type of expenditure), and a more normal, less compressed budget cycle. The \nMTEF will help improve the budget process and outcomes by clarifying policy objectives and \nmaking budget allocations more predictable, the coverage more comprehensive, and the use of \nresources more transparent.  \n7.  Adopting and implementing the MTEF will be a long-term endeavor and will require \npolicy  officials  and  technical  staff  to  buy  into  and  commit  to  continuous  improvement. \n                                                 \n6  The GFIS, the first nationwide automation project of the MOF, was developed and is being implemented with \nassistance from ADB. \n7  Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project: Implementation Policy Framework, issued by the Deputy Prime Minister of the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic to ADB, 7 March 2005. The Government\u2019s commitment to implement all activities \nrequired under the PEMSP is also among the specific assurances given by the Government for the Nam Theun 2 \n(NT2) Project, ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed \nLoan  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  for  the  Nam  Theun  2 \nHydroelectric Project. Manila (Loan 2162-LAO, approved on 4 April, para. 83[ix]). According to the NT2 RMA, SAO \nwill publish, starting in FY2009, an audit opinion on the statement of receipts and transfers for the NT2 revenue \naccount, covering the financial statements of eligible programs, and attest to the use of NT2 funds for eligible \nprograms. \n8  TA 4627-Lao: Public Expenditure Planning for National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy was approved in \n2005 to assist in developing and pilot-testing the MTFF and the MTEF. The MTEF contains estimates of the cost of \ndelivering existing programs (approved by the Government) over the medium term, consistent with the fiscal \nstrategy presented in the MTFF. The 3-year MTEF centers on policy priorities and supports decisions about the \nlevel and allocation of resources, both government-wide and within individual spending agencies.  \n ", "  3\nKnowledge and applied skills in macroeconomics and public expenditure management will be \ndeveloped. TA in support of this critical area is needed to reinforce and build on the ongoing \nPFM initiatives\u2014implementation of the revised chart of accounts and budget classification, \ncentralization of the treasury, strengthening of external audit, further GFIS updating, and efforts \nto establish internal controls and internal audit. The proposed TA and other, complementary \nsupport measures under PEMSP will address the severe capacity constraints and skill gaps in \nbudget planning, budget execution, accounting, reporting, and auditing. Improvements must be \nmade in these areas\u2014allocations must be linked to policy, expenditure, and public finance \nreporting for efficient budget outcomes\u2014to strengthen public spending for poverty reduction.  \n8.  Progress  in  implementing  PEMSP  will  allow  the  Government  to  meet  its  specific \ncommitments under the revenue management arrangements for the Nam Theun 2 and other \nrevenue-earning projects and will help reduce poverty in the country. The challenge lies in the \ndegree of the Government\u2019s commitment to overall PFM reform, especially through the adoption \nof international good practices. The proposed TA will support more coordinated programming, \nthe  strengthening  and  increased  use  of  national  systems,  and  the  adoption  of  common \nprocedures  and  harmonized  activities  by  development  partners,  in  line  with  the  Vientiane \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness.9  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9  The TA will strengthen PFM in Lao PDR to enable the country to reduce poverty and \nhelp it to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Its outcome will be efficient resource \nallocation within and between sectors, with more predictable budgets and greater accountability \nfor expenditure in selected ministries, based on the Government\u2019s socioeconomic programs and \nbenchmarked against international good practice standards in PFM. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Institutional Assessment and Diagnostic Review. The TA will involve reviewing and \nassessing progress made toward overall PFM reforms, and identifying institutional constraints \non the implementation of PEMSP reform measures by the Executing Agency (EA) and the \nImplementing Agencies (IAs), taking into account the intergovernmental fiscal policy measures \ncarried out in recent years. The gap analysis will cover selected provinces.  \n11.  Implementation  of  MTFF  and  MTEF  in  Selected  Ministries,  Consistent  with \nExisting Methodological Framework. The present fiscal planning process, including progress \nin the budget management process, will be assessed. Challenges and opportunities will be \nidentified and addressed in the implementation of the Budget Law and in the drafting of the \nimplementing decrees and related ministerial instructions, and improvements will be made in the \nmethodological  framework  of  the  MTFF  and  MTEF  models  already  developed.  Specific \ntechnical and policy issues in the implementation of the MTFF and MTEF framework for all \n                                                 \n9  The Vientiane Declaration\u2019s Action Plan on Aid Effectiveness, an agreed road map for more effective development \nassistance, was endorsed by the Government of Lao PDR and development partners in May 2007. The declaration \nbuilds on the key themes of the Paris Declaration, which has been endorsed by ADB and other development \npartners. The Paris Declaration underscores three critical PFM challenges in Lao PDR\u2014harmonization of donor \nassistance,  alignment  of  donor  assistance  with  government-owned  reform  programs,  and  effective  capacity \ndevelopment over the long term. \n ", "4 \nministries  and  provinces  (including  agreeing  on  data,  assumptions,  parameters,  and  the \nstructure of the model; updating and reprioritizing procedures and baseline projections over the \nmedium term) will be identified and addressed. An indicative MTEF will be formulated for other \npriority  sectors  (Ministry  of  Agriculture  [MOA]  and  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport \n[MPW&T]). The TA will also support the establishment of an institutional framework in the form \nof an interministerial technical working group, as recommended in the draft action plan prepared \nunder TA 4627-LAO for strengthening budget management practices (footnote 8). The MTEF \nwill be implemented on a pilot basis in the Ministry of Finance and selected line ministries. Staff \ncapacity, data availability, and other practical implementation matters will be considered in the \nselection of the ministries.  \n12.  Implementation  of  a  Capacity  Development  Road  Map.  The  fiscal  policy  and \npersonnel departments of the MOF will be assisted in formulating and implementing a long-term \ncapacity development plan for the central ministries (MOF and selected line ministries) and \nselected provincial finance departments, to improve PFM capacities as needed for budget \nplanning, which will include working with MTFF and MTEF methodology. Besides training in the \neffective implementation of the MTFF and MTEF models, the capacity development plan will \ninclude  training  in  generic  PFM  techniques  (budgetary  systems,  international  PFM/PEM \nstandards, budget planning, budget execution, budget monitoring, and reporting). Training in \nmacroeconomics, public finance, fiscal planning, and change management will also be given. In \naddition, training in information technology (IT), to enable government staff to use computer \nspreadsheets and database management models, will be covered by the TA. Participatory and \n\u201caction  learning\u201d  or  \u201clearning  by  doing\u201d  approaches  will  be  used.  Besides,  study  tours  for \nselected key functionaries to neighboring countries undertaking similar reforms will be proposed \nto enable these officials to exchange experiences and learn from the successes with similar \nsystems in these countries. Seminars will be conducted and civil servants will be trained to act \nas facilitators. The TA will make use of the training infrastructure of MOF and the resources of \nacademic institutions to ensure the sustainability of the capacity development efforts.  \n13.  Open  forums,  seminars,  and  conferences,  with  representatives  from  the  National \nAssembly, the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), MOF, sector ministries, and provinces \nparticipating, will strengthen the policy dialogue and facilitate in-depth discussions on PFM and \ngovernance issues. Eminent persons and high-level representatives from selected countries, \nthe Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Secretariat, multilateral development banks, \nand development partners will also be invited to the open forums. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1.2  million.  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of \n$1.1 million from its TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of $100,000 \nby providing counterpart staff, office space, utilities, and physical facilities. Appendix 2 gives the \ncost estimates and financing plan. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The MOF, principally through its fiscal policy, personnel, and budget departments, will be \nthe EA. The planning and budget departments of MOA, MOE, MOH, MPW&T, and MPI will be \nthe IAs. The PEMSP coordination mechanisms will be used to facilitate the review of TA \n ", "  5\nimplementation progress in the overall context of the PEMSP.10 The project director for the \nproposed TA will be nominated by the vice minister of finance. \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from June 2008 to May 2010, and will \nrequire a team of two international specialists (17 person-months) in PEM and PFM, and two \nnational experts (32 person-months) in fiscal management and software development, working \nintermittently over the TA implementation period. The consultants will be hired through a firm \nfollowing quality- and cost-based selection and the submission of simplified technical proposals, \nand according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The firm will provide overall project management oversight over the consultants\u2019 output. \nThe  consulting  team  will  produce  various  reports  and  plans  as  outlined  in  their  terms  of \nreference, which will be discussed in tripartite meetings and approved by the Government. The \nteam will perform the functions of a project management unit and provide technical PFM advice, \nincluding ongoing functional and IT support. Desktop computers, printers for user departments, \nand laptops for project coordinators identified by the EA and the IAs will be provided to assist in \nproject implementation and to enable the sharing of a common database within the EA and IAs \nduring project implementation. ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) will be applied in procuring IT and other assets for this project. All equipment certified by \nthe  consultants  will  be  turned  over  to  the  EA  according  to  ADB  procedures  after  the \nimplementation period. The TA will support joint review and monitoring by ADB and government \nagencies  for  effective  implementation,  including  regular  consultations  with  all  stakeholders \nthrough participatory workshops and seminars, to build consensus and government ownership \nof the outputs of the TA. There will also be close coordination with external funding agencies \ninvolved in the PEMSP. A public and government-wide awareness campaign will be organized \nto promote understanding of the importance of this work and to cope effectively with change \nmanagement issues. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION  \n17.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,100,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Lao PDR for \nStrengthening Public Financial Management. \n                                                 \n10 The PEMSP implementation arrangements include (i) a PEMSP program steering committee, chaired by the vice \nminister of finance and with representatives from the relevant MOF departments, which reviews progress and \napproves work programs for the implementation of the PEMSP components; and (ii) a PEMSP implementation \ncommittee, chaired by the deputy director general of the fiscal policy department and supported by a full-time \nPEMSP secretariat. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nFunctional public financial  \u2022  Improved performance against  \u2022  Six midterm review reports  \u2022  Continued high-level \nmanagement (PFM)  the PFM indicators, and good  on the NSEDP  political commitment to \nsystems  practices in place, within 3\u20135  \u2022  Annual budget reports  PFM reforms \n  years after TA completion   \u2022  National census reports on  \u2022  Sustained macroeconomic \n    poverty, and MDG progress  stability  \n  reports    \n\u2022  Public expenditure and  Risk \nfiduciary assessment reports  \u2022  Changes in leadership and \nof MDBs   strategic priorities and focus \nof the Government \nOutcome    Assumption \nEfficient inter- and intra- \u2022  About 60% of FY2009 and  \u2022  Public expenditure review  \u2022  Continued stakeholder \nsectoral resource allocation  FY2010 budget allocations for  and public expenditure  commitment to reform and \nwith greater budgetary  priority sectors and programs,  tracking surveys by IFIs   effective coordination \npredictability and  based on expenditure ratios,  \u2022  Review reports of the  between MOF and the \naccountability for  aligned with NGPES and  Vientiane Declaration on Aid  sector ministries in priority \nexpenditure outcomes in  NSEDP6 prioritiesa  Effectiveness and  areas  \nselected ministries  \u2022  MTEF widely used in MOF\u2019s  Harmonization Country   \n  fiscal management and fiscal  Action Plan   \n  planning to guide the annual  \u2022  Periodic progress reports on \n  budget process, by FY2009.  the implementation of the \nPEMSP by the Government  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
