THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Power Transmission Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will help to complete the critically important 230 kilovolt (kV) transmission \nring line supplying electricity to the populous Yangon region and ensure a reliable supply of \nelectricity  for  sustainable  economic  development.2The  project  is  in  line  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) interim country partnership strategy for Myanmar for 2012\u20132014, \nwhich has been extended to 2016. Energy is a core sector in this strategy, which makes electric \npower infrastructure a priority within the sector. The project is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for Myanmar for 2015\u20132017. 3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale  \n3.  Improving electricity supply in Myanmar to make it reliable is critical to sustaining the \ncountry\u2019s  economic  growth  and  meeting  the  government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  objectives. \nMyanmar embarked on wide-ranging economic reforms in 2011 that have resulted in a rapid \nexpansion of its economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 7.2% \nduring 2011\u20132014 to $56.6 billion, and the government expects growth to average 7.1% a year \nduring  2015\u20132030.  Sustaining  this  high  growth  will  be  important  to  reducing  poverty  and \nimproving living conditions, particularly given the low baseline per capita GDP of $1,113 in \n2014. Per capita electricity consumption during the year was only 165 kilowatt-hours (kWh), and \nthe electrification rate was a low 35%.  \n \n4.  As the economy grows and poverty reduction accelerates, demand for electricity is \nexpected to rise by 9.6% annually from 10,112 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2013 to 49,924 GWh in \n2030. To meet this rising demand, the government plans to expand the power subsector\u2019s \nphysical  infrastructure  by  developing  new  generation  sources,  upgrading  and  expanding \ntransmission and distribution networks. It also intends to strengthen the subsector\u2019s governance \nand performance. \n \n5.  Priority areas for power  subsector development. With assistance from ADB and \nother development partners, the government has prepared long-term development plans for the \nenergy sector.4 The plans accord high priority in the power subsector to (i) rehabilitating existing \npower plants and constructing new ones to increase installed generation capacity to meet fast-\ngrowing demand; (ii) expanding and upgrading  the transmission grid and substations to remove \nbottlenecks and ensure that they can transmit all the power generated at the power plants to the \nload demand centers; (iii) expanding transmission and distribution networks to connect more \nconsumers  to  the  electricity  grid,  particularly  in  rural  areas;  and  (iv)  strengthening  the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2013.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Union  of  Myanmar  for  Power  Transmission  and \nDistribution Improvement Project. Manila (TA 8342-MYA). \n3  ADB. 2012.

", "2 \n \ntransmission  and  distribution  networks,  especially  in  the  populous  Yangon  and  Mandalay \nregions, which are the country\u2019s important commercial centers.  \n \n6.  Subsector governance and institutions. The power subsector\u2019s legal and regulatory \ninfrastructure has been strengthened, particularly through a new electricity law enacted in 2014. \nThe law provides the framework for formulating electricity regulations, creating a regulatory \nauthority, and improving effectiveness and performance in the subsector through greater private \nsector  participation.  The  Ministry  of  Electric  Power  (MOEP)  is  in  charge  of  all  subsector \nactivities,  including  developing,  implementing,  operating,  and  maintaining  all  the  country\u2019s \nhydropower, coal-fired, and gas-fired power plants, as well as the power transmission and \ndistribution  networks.  The  MEPE,  which  is  an  operational  department  of  the  MOEP,  is \nresponsible  for  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the  transmission  networks.5  The \nsubsector  has  been  undergoing  a  gradual  restructuring  to  improve  governance  and \ncompetitiveness. In 2015, the Yangon Electricity Supply Board, which was previously also an \noperational department of MOEP, was made the Yangon Electricity Supply Corporation (YESC), \na semiautonomous stated-owned enterprise.  \n \n7.  System  generation  and  transmission  planning.  The  MOEP\u2019s  generation  and \ntransmission expansion plans and the national electricity master plan provide a schedule for the \nconstruction of new generation and transmission projects across the power system between \nnow and 2030. Current installed capacity totals 4,366 megawatts (MW) nationwide, consisting of \n3,005 MW of generation capacity based on hydropower; 1,236 MW based on gas; a 120 MW \ncoal-fired power plant; and 5 MW using renewable energy. To meet the growing power demand, \nthe government aims to increase total generation capacity to 23,594 MW by 2030, including \n8,896 MW based on hydropower. The transmission network will also need to be expanded \nsignificantly to accommodate the added power supply. The country\u2019s electricity master plan \nincludes construction of a 500 kV backbone grid to transmit electricity generated in the North to \nload demand centers in the South, along with 230 kV grids that will branch out to provide \nelectricity to support socioeconomic development, rural electrification, and poverty reduction. \n \n8.  ADB  assistance.  Since ADB reengaged in Myanmar in 2012, it has provided $4.7 \nmillion in technical assistance to help the country strengthen governance and performance in \nthe energy sector and a $60 million Asian Development Fund loan to expand and upgrade \nelectricity  infrastructure. 6 ADB  (i)  helped  to  develop  the  2014  electricity  law7 and  prepare \ntransmission and distribution grid codes and electric standards and specifications; (ii) provided \ninstitutional support to the MOEP; (iii) supported a financial management assessment of four \nstate-owned  enterprises  under  the  MOEP;  and  (iv)  assisted  the  MOEP  in  strengthening \nsafeguard requirements and procedures.8 In addition, ADB\u2019s Energy for All initiative provided \nassistance to promote the use of off-grid solar-based systems to improve access to electricity \n                                                \n5  The MEPE is also in charge of operating and maintaining gas-fired power plants. \n6  ADB. 2013.

Development coordination.  ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), \nand the World Bank have worked closely to coordinate their assistance in the power subsector.10 \nThis assistance has included (i) loans and grants from ADB to rehabilitate distribution networks \nin the Magway, Mandalay, Sagaing, and Yangon regions; (ii) loans and grants from the World \nBank to rehabilitate Thaton\u2019s gas-fired plant (108 MW); and (iii) loans and grants from JICA to \nrehabilitate gas-fired plants within Yangon region, and a hydropower plant and distribution \nnetworks in other townships in  the Yangon region. In the near future,  ADB plans to help \nstrengthen the country\u2019s 230 kV transmission and distribution networks, JICA intends to support \nconstruction of the 500 kV national transmission backbone and rehabilitation of the Yangon \ndistribution  network,  while  the  World  Bank  will  support  both  on-grid  and  off-grid  rural \nelectrification. 11 \n \n10.  Yangon region. The Yangon region is the country\u2019s main commercial center, economic \nhub, the entry point for foreign direct investment, the key initial destination for foreign tourists, \nand the source of 24% of Myanmar\u2019s GDP. The region consumes about 50% of the country\u2019s \nelectricity,  of  which  commercial  and  industrial  activities  account  for  a  52%  share  that  will \ncontinue  to  grow.  All  this  makes  a  reliable  supply  of  electricity  crucial  to  the  country\u2019s \nsocioeconomic growth and the strengthening of Yangon\u2019s aging and overloaded transmission \nand distribution networks a government priority. Along with ADB\u2019s power distribution project \napproved in 2013 (footnote 6), this project will significantly improve the reliability of the electricity \nsupply in Yangon, benefitting the region\u2019s residential, commercial, and industrial consumers and \nthe country\u2019s overall development.   \n \n11.  Project focus. Yangon\u2019s current transmission network consists mainly of 66 kV facilities \nset up as two inner rings. These 66 kV networks receive power via an incomplete outer 230 kV \nring,  which  supplies  electricity  to  the  Ahlone  and  Thaketa  substations.  Meanwhile,  the \ntransmission sections between Ahlone, Thida, and Thaketa substations still operates at 66 kV. \nThis situation requires the urgent upgrade of the transmission sections between Ahlone, Thida, \nand Thaketa substations from 66 kV to 230 kV. The MEPE is now upgrading the Ahlone\u2013Thida \nsection, and the project will upgrade the Thida\u2013Thaketa\u2013Kyaikasan transmission lines to 230 kV \nand construct two new substations at South Okkalapa and West University. This will complete \nthe  critical  230  kV  ring  for  Yangon  through  substations  at  Ahlone,  Thida,  Thaketa,  South \nOkkalapa, Hlawga, Myang Tagar, West University, Hlaing Thayar, and back to Ahlone. The \nMEPE  will  be  responsible  for  connecting  the  new  South  Okkalapa  and  West  University \nsubstations to be built under the project to the rest of the transmission network. Upon project \ncompletion, the fully equipped 230 kV transmission ring will boost supply capacity and reliability \nand reduce transmission losses. The MEPE plans to develop two larger additional 230 kV \ntransmission rings in phases. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2014.

ADB and JICA co-lead the \nworking group, which includes such other development partners as the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, \nand the World Bank. \n ", "4 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.    The project\u2019s impact will be the economic and social benefits to residential, commercial, \nand industrial consumers in the Yangon region from reliable and adequate supply of electricity. \nThe outcome will be improved reliability of the Yangon region\u2019s power transmission network.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The project outputs will be (i) a 230 kV power transmission ring, including 230 kV \ntransmission line and substations, developed for the Yangon region; 12 and (ii) the capacity of \nMEPE staff to implement ADB-financed projects strengthened. Construction of the transmission \nlines and substations will be completed in March 2019. A fully staffed project implementation \nunit will be established within MEPE. \n \nD.

Procurement \n17.  The project will procure two design\u2013build\u2013supply\u2013install\u2013commission contracts\u2014one for \nthe Thida\u2013Thaketa\u2013Kyaikasan transmission lines; and the other for the construction of the \nSouth Okkalapa and West University substations, the extension of the Thaketa substation, and \nthe  upgrading  of  Kyaikasan  substation.  ADB  will  use  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures and a single-stage one-envelope process in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The government will finance the project \nadministration costs, the environmental and social safeguards measures, and the construction \nof access roads and staff housing in substation areas with counterpart funds. It will follow its \nown procurement procedures. Further details are provided in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n2.  Implementation Consultants \n18.    The project will require 209 person-months of consulting services, comprising  117 \nperson-months  of  international  and  92  person-months  of  national  services.  The  project \nimplementation consultants (PICs) will help manage and implement the project and strengthen \nMEPE staff capacity. A consulting firm will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), using the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method  with  a  90:10  ratio  and  a  full  technical  proposal.  The  detailed  terms  of \nreference for the consultants are in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n19.  The MOEP requires that the project transmission lines be overhead lines. The ADB\u2019s \ntechnical due diligence recommended the use of aluminum compact core conductors (ACCCs) \nto increase transmission capacity and of compact monopoles in combination with steel lattice \ntowers where necessary.16 This approach will make construction easier, lower costs, and ensure \nthat the lines operate reliably. Compact monopoles will also minimize the land requirements for \nfootings. ACCCs can carry a higher electrical load than usual conductors and will reduce \ntransmission losses by one percentage point. The use of n-1 criteria in the power system design \nwill improve the reliability and quality of electricity delivered to customers.17  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  Economic analysis. The economic viability of the project was assessed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects by comparing the societal costs and \nbenefits of the with-project and without-project scenarios. 18 The project will significantly boost \nthe capacity and reliability of the power transmission network in the Yangon region, thereby \nmaking greater and more dependable electricity supply available to meet the rapidly increasing \nload demand.  \n \n21.  The  project  will  generate  incremental  benefits  and  nonincremental  benefits.  The \nincremental benefits will accrue from the additional transmission capacity. Power sales will rise \n                                                \n16 The ACCCs are also being used for the Ahlone\u2013Thida section under MOEP financing, and their use for the Thida\u2013\nThaketa section will ensure conductor compatibility. \n17 This gives the transmission and distribution networks the ability to lose a linkage without this causing an overload \nfailure elsewhere. \n18 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \n \nby 1,000 GWh per year as soon as operations start in 2020, and these incremental sales will \nreach and level out at 3,300 GWh per year in 2025. The nonincremental benefits will arise from \nthe avoidance of power outages in the Yangon region, and the analysis has estimated that this \navoidance  of  power  outages  will  be  equivalent  to  1,000  megawatt-hours  per  year.  The \nincremental electricity sales have been valued at the long-term marginal cost, estimated to be \n$0.0932 per kWh.  \n \n22.  The estimated economic internal rate of return is 14.4%. The net present value at a 12% \ndiscount rate is estimated to be $11.9 million. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that the project \nwould remain economically viable under several important adverse scenarios.19  \n \n23.    Financial analysis. The project\u2019s financial viability was examined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.20 The MEPE is the sole buyer and \nwholesaler of electricity in Myanmar and purchases the electricity from all generation sources, \nincluding independent power producers. It sells this electricity for distribution to the YESC and \nthe Electricity Supply Enterprise (ESE), which is responsible for electricity distribution outside \nYangon region. The key factors determining the MEPE\u2019s financial performance are the price of \ngas used for power generation, the price at which it buys the electricity, and the wholesale \nelectricity  tariff.  In  2014,  the  purchasing  price  was  $0.02  per  kWh\u2013$0.07  per  kWh,  the \ngeneration price using gas was $0.10 per kWh, and the wholesale tariff was $0.055 per kWh for \nthe YESC and $0.05 per kWh for the ESE. \n \n24.    The financial analysis compared in real terms the present values of the future revenue \nand cost streams of the with-project and without-project scenarios. The incremental project \nbenefits  to  accrue  from  the  additional  electricity  sales  made  possible  by  the  project\u2019s \ntransmission network upgrade were compared with the incremental costs of the project. The \npost-tax financial net present value of the projected incremental cash flows discounted at the \nweighted average cost of capital is $178 million. The estimated post-tax real financial internal \nrate of return of the project is 12.15%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital of \n0.29%. This confirms that the project is financially viable. It remained so under sensitivity \ntesting.21 \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  The  government  regulates  electricity  tariffs.  The  tariff  is  MK35\u2013MK50  per  kWh  for \nresidential consumers and MK75\u2013MK150 per kWh for commercial and industrial consumers, \ndepending on the consumption level. These low tariffs require the government to subsidize the \ncost of fuel for power producers and the operations of the MEPE, the ESE, and the YESC. A \nnew electricity law adopted in 2014 opens the way for unbundling the power subsector, a \ngreater role for the private sector, and the establishment of an independent electricity regulatory \ncommission. Under the law, the electricity regulatory commission will set the electricity tariffs \nbased on the cost recovery principles and in consultation with the government. The tariff reform \nwill aim to improve efficiency and financial sustainability in the power subsector, while also \nmeeting the government\u2019s poverty reduction objectives by providing electricity to the poor with \naffordable price.  \n \n26.  The government is committed to improving governance and addressing corruption. An \nanticorruption  commission  was  formed  in  January  2013,  and  an  anticorruption  law  was \n                                                \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \npromulgated  in  July  2013.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the MOEP. ADB will organize training \nsessions  for  MOEP  and  MEPE  staff  on  all  aspects  of  project  implementation  and  ADB \nguidelines and procedures, including those for implementation, procurement, recruitment of \nconsultants, disbursement, reporting, monitoring by ADB staff and the PICs, and prevention of \nfraud and corruption by ADB staff. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  By strengthening the power transmission network in the Yangon region, the project will \nbuild on ADB\u2019s Power Distribution Improvement Project (footnote 6), which is upgrading the \ndistribution network in the region to benefit industry, commercial businesses, and residential \nconsumers. Full realization of the  project benefits will depend on the improvements being \nundertaken across the entire power subsector. More than one million customers in the Yangon \nregion will benefit indirectly. \n \n28.  The project does not have a gender component or highly significant gender impacts. The \ninflux  of  male  workers  at  project  construction  sites  may  lead  to  a  high  risk  of  sexually \ntransmitted infections. To mitigate these impacts, the turnkey contracts will include requirements \nfor prevention and other health and safety measures. A code of conduct for workers is included \nin the environmental management plan (EMP). The PICs will conduct training sessions and \ninformation campaigns for the PIU, local communities, and workers on gender issues, including \nthe  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  The  social  aspects  of  the  project  are \ndescribed in the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy. 22 \n \n29.  The project is not located in areas where conflict or peace negotiations might affect the \npace  of  project  implementation.  Consultations  with  institutional  stakeholders  from  involved \nministries, the Yangon city authorities, and the affected people did not identify any conflict-\nsensitive issues. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). Relevant safeguard documents have been prepared in accordance \nwith the Myanmar\u2019s laws and regulations and the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. These \ninclude (i) an initial environmental examination (IEE) 23 report with EMPs for all the project \ncomponents, and (ii) a resettlement plan for the Thida\u2013Thaketa transmission line and due \ndiligence  reports  (DDRs)  for  the  Thaketa\u2013Kyaikasan  transmission  line  and  for  the  South \nOkkalapa and West University substations. 24 The safeguard documents have been disclosed on \nthe ADB website.  \n \n31.  Environmental  safeguards.  An  IEE  was  undertaken  to  identify  the  potential \nenvironmental impacts and the measures needed to mitigate them. It included an environmental \ncompliance audit of existing facilities. The IEE and EMPs were prepared in consultation with \naffected communities and stakeholders in the Yangon region in accordance with the SPS and \nMyanmar\u2019s laws and regulations. The potential environmental impacts the IEE identified are \nprimarily related to construction. They include noise and dust pollution and sedimentation of a \n                                                \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \ncreek during tower foundation work on its banks. The construction related impacts also include \nrisk of electric shock, increased traffic and risk of traffic accidents near construction sites, \nconcerns  over the  work  camp  waste management  and  workers\u2019  health  and  safety. These \nimpacts are site-specific and can be mitigated and managed by the measures that have been \nincorporated into the EMPs. \n \n32.  The EMPs will form part of the bidding documents. Prior to awarding contracts, the \nMEPE will reassess the potential environmental impacts and ensure that appropriate mitigation \nmeasures  are  in  place.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  and  monitoring  requirements  are \nspecified in the IEE and EMPs. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project will involve permanent \nland  acquisition  for  the  monopoles  and  tower  footings  of  the  Thida\u2013Thaketa\u2013Kyaikasan \ntransmission  lines,  the  Kyaikasan  substation  upgrade,  the  South  Okkalapa  substation \nconstruction, and the access road to the West University substation. A total of 2,640 square \nmeters (m2) of land will be acquired for the Thida\u2013Thaketa transmission line; 2,712 m2 for \nThaketa\u2013Kyaikasan transmission line; and 3,875 m2 for upgrading the Kyaikasan substation. \nLand for the South Okkalapa substation (58,000 m2), belongs to the Ministry of Defense, while \nland for the West University substation belongs to the MOEP. A 6,782 m2 strip of land cutting \nthrough the properties of Ministry of Transport and two private households will be acquired to \nbuild an access road to the West University substation. The project will also have temporary \nimpacts during the construction of the transmission lines. \n \n34.  The MEPE has prepared one resettlement plan for the Thida\u2013Thaketa transmission line, \na DDR for the South Okkalapa and West University substations, and a DDR for the Kyaikasan\u2013\nThaketa  transmission  line.  The  resettlement  plan  for  the  Thida\u2013Thaketa  transmission  line \nidentifies 25 main structures that will be affected, and an estimated 23 households comprising \n120  people  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  at  full  replacement  cost  for  their  lost  assets, \nincomes,  and  businesses.  The  resettlement  plan  also  provides  the  implementation \narrangements,  monitoring  requirements,  and  a  grievance  mechanism.  The  compensation \nbudget is included in the project costs to be financed by the MOEP.  \n \n35.  No  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  the  South  Okkalapa  and  West  University \nsubstations, since their respective DDRs showed that all the land will be acquired through \nnegotiated  settlement.  The  MEPE  has  committed  to  independent  third-party  verification, \nconsistent with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. The DDR for the Kyaikasan\u2013Thaketa \ntransmission line found that one household could be affected by the location of a steel lattice \ntower. The MEPE has confirmed that it will not resort to expropriation should negotiations fail. \nInstead, it will change the line alignment or the tower location. \n \n36.  The  project  will  not  lead  to  any  physical  relocation  or  impacts  on  communities  of \nindigenous people. None live within or close to the substations. Six ethnic minority households \nwere identified along the Thida\u2013Thaketa transmission line corridor, but they are not considered \nindigenous peoples in the context of the SPS and will not be affected by the project. \n \n37.  The MEPE will recruit the PICs with international and national safeguards specialists in \nenvironment and resettlement who will provide training and help the PIU implement the EMPs, \nand resettlement plans. The PICs will also give the PIU environmental management training. \nThe  estimated  budget  for  the  implementation  of  the  safeguard  mitigation  plans  has  been \nincorporated in the project implementation costs. \n \n ", "10 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The overall project risk is assessed to be medium. The integrated benefits and impacts \nof  the  project  are expected to  outweigh the  project  costs.  The major  risks  and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.25  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe government may not be able to  ADB helped the government set up the Electricity Regulatory Commission, \nestablish a mechanism for setting  which will be tasked with establishing and implementing tariffs based on \ntariff based on cost-recovery  cost-recovery principles.
