The Project will \nalso contribute to establish a conducive policy, institutional, and \nregulatory environment to meet the housing needs of urban poor \ncommunities in informal settlement areas. \n   \nRationale  With the population of Indonesia expected to have reached 209 \nmillion inhabitants in 2000, and an urbanization rate of 40%, some \n84  million  people  are  living  in  Indonesian  cities.  The  rate  of \nurbanization continues apace. Some 20% of households are poor \nor vulnerable to poverty. Housing and housing finance markets \nhave  not  provided  products  that  are  appropriate  to  their \ncircumstances. As a result, almost all of these people are living in \ninformal areas and are experiencing a deterioration in the level of \nservices and infrastructure provided by local government, itself \nhard pressed by fiscal stringency. \n   \nObjective  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  income  poverty  and \nquality-of-life poverty in urban areas. The purpose of the Project is \nto put in place mechanisms for provision of affordable housing \nand serviced land for the poor. In order to do this, it will (i) improve \nthe access of low-income urban families to tenured, serviced plots \nand to opportunities for house upgrading and new housing; (ii) \nprovide appropriate finance for shelter and other services; and (iii) \nstrengthen  low-income  communities,  local  governments,  the \nNational  Land  Agency,  financing  institutions,  and  DGHS  to \nparticipate in a pro-poor shelter provision and finance system. \n   ", "iv \nCost Estimates  The  Project  is  expected  to  cost  $126.5  million  equivalent, \ncomprising $111.9 million (88%) in local currency and $14.6 million \n(12%) in foreign currency. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total  Percentage \nExchange  Currency  Cost  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  14.6  74.0  88.6  70.0 \n ADF  3.98  16.02  20.0   \n OCR  10.62  57.98  68.6   \nCentral Government  0.0  5.6  5.6  4.4 \nCity Governments  0.0  30.1  30.1  23.8 \nCFIs/LFIs  0.0  0.5  0.50  0.4 \nBeneficiaries  0.0  1.7  1.70  1.3 \nTotal    14.6   111.9   126.5   100.0       \n \n  ADF = Asian Development Fund, CFI = central financial institution, LFI = local \nfinancial institution, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nNote: Figures may not add up to total because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  Loan proceeds amounting to about $15 million equivalent will be \nTerms  relent  to  participating  financial  institutions  at  the  cost  of  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) funds plus guarantee and administration \nfees and a foreign exchange risk premium, if applicable.  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $68.6 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill be provided under its London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum, and a front-end fee of 0.50%, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. (In the event \nthat the loan is not approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2003, \nthe front-end fee will revert to 1%, or such other percentage to be \ndetermined  by  the  Board.)  A  loan  of  $20  million  will  also  be \nprovided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date ", "v \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, from 2004 to 2010. \nArrangements  DGHS will form a project steering committee (PSC). The National \nDevelopment Planning Board (BAPPENAS) will chair the PSC and \nhave prime responsibility for overall coordination. Each participating \nlocal government will organize a local coordinating office to ensure \nefficient  project  execution  and  incorporation  of  priorities  of  local \ncommunities  into  project  design  and  implementation.  The \nmembership of the local coordinating office will include community \nrepresentatives  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of  community \naction plans and resettlement guidelines. Involuntary resettlement \nwill be minimal as existing sites will be upgraded or new vacant \nsites developed.  \n \nExecuting Agency  Directorate  General  of  Housing  and  Settlements,  Ministry  of \nSettlements and Regional Infrastructure \n \nProcurement  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement will be followed. \n \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A \nteam of international and domestic project management consultants \nwill help the project management unit (PMU) implement, manage, \nand  monitor  project  activities.  The  consultants  will  help  review \ncommunity  action  plans  and  contract  documents,  and  provide \ntraining for local governments, local financial institutions (LFIs) or \ntheir branches, and the PMU in project implementation, monitoring \nand  evaluation,  finance,  and  community  participation.  Local \ngovernment counterpart funds will finance local coordinating offices. \nWhere  required  for  these  units,  domestic  consultants  will  be \nrecruited following procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  support  the  poverty  reduction  goals  of  the \nBeneficiaries  Government  and  ADB,  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  urban \ninformal settlers. Under site and service development subprojects, \nland ownership issues will be resolved and individual titles or other \nforms of secure tenure distributed, directly benefiting 180,000 poor \nurban households in a minimum of 30 local governments. Nearby \ncommunities  will  indirectly  benefit  from  the  provision  of  off-site \ninfrastructure, including flood protection facilities, main roads, and \nmain drainage systems. Similar cases of site improvement have \nbeen shown to increase the market value of land by 200\u2013700%. \nSignificant  gains  will  accrue  to  the  implementing  agencies  (as \nincreased  revenues  from  property  taxes)  as  well  as  end-\nbeneficiaries  (as  better  social,  financial,  and  economic  status). \nOverall, the Project is expected to have a poverty impact ratio of \nover 0.52.  \n \n ", "vi \nRisks and Assumptions  The key risk to the Project is the possibility of faltering commitment \nof local governments to facilitating the provision of shelter for the \npoor in a sustainable manner. The key assumption is that at the \nlocal  level  the  political  commitment  to  low-income  housing  will \ncontinue,  independent  of  politically  elected  government \nrepresentatives. ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector Project. \n2.  In  June  2002  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) for the Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector Project.1 With \nthe help of the PPTA, which was carried out from October 2002, the Directorate General of \nHuman  Settlements  (DGHS)  designed  a  decentralized  investment  project  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction and shelter strategies, and prepared a feasibility study on \nshelter improvement for urban informal settlers. The Project was formulated using a sample of \nsix pilot local governments.2 Project design incorporates feedback from consultations with the \nGovernment and target beneficiaries. This report is based on the findings of the Appraisal \nMission, conducted on 13\u201331 October 2003; reports of the PPTA consultants; and follow-on \ndiscussions  with  the  national  and  local  governments,  international  assistance  agencies, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and beneficiaries. The proposed executing agencies, \nGovernment, and ADB agreed on the project goals, objectives, scope and scale, cost estimates, \nand financing plan. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Demand for urban infrastructure services and housing is increasing. The population was \n203.4 million in 2000, compared to 119.2 million in 1971. Although Indonesia has dramatically \nreduced its population growth rate (from 2.32% in 1971\u20131980 to 1.61% in 1980\u20131999), the \nurban population continues to grow at about 4.6% per year (1990\u20132000). An estimated 42.5% of \nthe population was living in urban areas in 2000; the figure is estimated to be over 50% by 2010 \nand 60% by 2025.  \n4.  Despite heavy investments in environmental infrastructure, conditions in poor urban \nareas continue to deteriorate, aggravated by the impact of the 1997 economic crisis. Only about \n36% of the urban population has access to piped water. Land administration leaves much to be \ndesired. The National Land Agency (BPN) is responsible for land administration of only 30% of \nthe national land, and less than 10% of the country is covered by cadastral maps. While housing \nfinance has received considerable attention as the main instrument to increase and improve \naccess to housing, the policy response has often neglected the interests of the poor. Conditions \nfor credit access (requiring land title, 30% down payment, verifiable income) virtually exclude \nthe poor, especially the self- or informally employed. Subsidies routed through the financial \nsystem, therefore, do not reach the poor. \n5.  External assistance has been provided to the sector institutions (Appendix 2), but most \nrecent assistance has supported decentralization by strengthening local governments, focusing \non city-wide infrastructure projects, and has not specifically targeted shelter. The Project does \nnot, therefore, duplicate any ongoing assistance. A more detailed sector analysis is in Appendix \n3. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Government of Indonesia for the Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter \nSector Project. Manila (TA 3895-INO, for $1 million, with $500,000 cofinancing provided by the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development). \n2  Local governments comprise city governments (kota) and districts (kabupaten). ", "2 \n6.  The Project benefits from considerable experience in the sector, in Indonesia and other \ncountries. Indonesia\u2019s Kampung (village) Improvement Program (KIP) achieved considerable \nprogress in providing basic infrastructure to poor neighborhoods. The key lessons of this and \nother  international  experience  are  that  (i)  community  involvement  in  planning  and \nimplementation improves targeting and, in conjunction with these factors, education in basic \nmaintenance increases the chances that provided infrastructure will be well maintained; (ii) poor \nhouseholds need secure tenure if they are to invest in their housing and neighborhood; and (iii) \na comprehensive approach, systematically selecting and prioritizing areas for upgrading, is most \neffective. Under KIP, later and more participatory projects were more sustainable. While tenure \nin Indonesia is not as dire as in some countries, owing to multiple levels and means of acquiring \nsome claim to title, upgrading of titles is a priority for the urban poor. KIP also demonstrated that \nin  the  resource  trade-off  between  large-scale  and  focused  scope  versus  small-scale  and \nbroader scope, such as in the Philippines, the former was more effective when guided by \nsystematic investment planning. \n7.  Until recently international experience in housing finance was similar to Indonesia\u2019s \nexperience.  However,  recent  developments  in  Latin  America  and,  on  a  smaller  scale,  in \nThailand and the Philippines, and in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and \nUnited Nations (UN) Habitat Community-Based Initiatives for Housing and Local Development \n(CoBILD) project in Indonesia have shown that microfinance techniques are more successful in \nproviding shelter finance to the poor. Short-term, small loans successfully finance incremental \nimprovements to housing and sequential purchase of lot and improved shelter. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n8.  Laws 22 and 25/1999 give local governments autonomy and a mandate to provide, or \nfacilitate the provision of, a number of urban services, including housing and slum upgrading. \nHowever, the organizational structure for pro-poor shelter provision in local governments is not \nwell  developed.  Few  cities  (Jakarta,  Tangerang,  and  Surabaya)  have  dedicated  pro-poor \nhousing programs, partly because city governments do not think pro-poor shelter investment is \nneeded to reduce poverty. Upgrading has not been a priority. However, this perception is \nchanging as local governments are being elected, and their capacity in the sector should be \nstrengthened.  Based  on  sector  assessments  and  policy  studies,  DGHS  recommended \nestablishing  housing  development  organizations  (HDOs)  in  each  local  government  and \nsupporting them with technical resources and access to finance for housing and upgrading \nprograms. The HDO should draft a local housing policy, plan housing and site identification, \nmonitor and evaluate implementation, help acquire land (where state land is used or in the case \nof compulsory purchase), and manage local government housing.  \n9.  As the poor lack access to finance to buy land and upgrade their houses, accessible \nfinancing mechanisms should be set up in financial institutions. Some of the poor do have \naccess to microcredit, which is generally unsuitable for housing finance as it is short term and \nhigh interest. Long-term finance is needed to build institutions\u2019 capacity to offer long-term, \naffordable,  and  low-interest  loans.  Policy  dialogue  has  focused  on  the  need  to  develop \nmechanisms  to  supply  finance  through  formal  financial  institutions,  which  react  to  local \ncommunity-based organization (CBO) initiatives, building on experience of the World Bank\u2019s \nUrban  Poverty  Project,  which  supports  community  and  livelihood  development  in  poor \ncommunities, and the UNDP and UN-Habitat CoBILD Project, which provides microcredit for \nhouse improvement and home and lot purchase through local NGOs. These projects have \nestablished local CBOs, which mobilize people to complement project activity. ", "3 \n10.  These issues were key items of policy dialogue during project preparation, focusing on \nsystems to achieve the Government\u2019s housing policy objectives. The Government has included \ntargets for the sector in the national development strategy and established four programs to \nimplement them: (i) development of housing financial institutions, (ii) enhancement of housing \nsupply  and  renovation  (renewal)  systems,  (iii)  enhancement  of  housing  facilities  and \ninfrastructure services, and (iv) enhancement of area revitalization and preservation. The draft \nnational housing policy is consistent with the above. The policy objectives are to (i) extend the \nformal housing market\u2019s ability to address the needs of a wider range of people (with specific \ninterventions in land, infrastructure, finance, and building standards and materials, using a \ncommunity-focused  approach);  (ii)  build  capacity  to  organize  human  settlements;  and  (iii) \nimprove support systems for housing and human settlement development. The Government has \nalso  committed  to  implementing  its  \u201cCities  without  Slums\u201d  policy  by  2010  and  the  newly \nannounced \u201cOne Million Houses\u201d program. It is focused on one of the Millennium Development \nGoals and is being undertaken by DGHS through its comprehensive program for participatory \nslum upgrading in over 150 local governments. The Project will thus address key issues in the \nsector:  supply  of  serviced,  tenured  plots;  provision  of  appropriate  shelter  finance;  and \nstrengthening of the capacity of sector institutions. These are the building blocks of the national \nstrategy and fit within, and extend, national investment programs in the sector (Appendix 3). \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n11.  The  project  goal  is  to  help  improve  living  conditions  of  the  urban  poor,  who  will \nparticipate in, and benefit from, improved shelter development, management, and financing \nprocesses that will increase their assets and improve their well-being. The project purpose is to \nupgrade  slums,  improve  housing,  and  provide  new  housing  for  the  urban  poor  project \nparticipants. The Project will improve local shelter planning and provision systems and the \nnational organizations servicing them, and enable financing systems to respond efficiently and \nin a sustainable manner to the needs of the urban poor. The Project is a sector project and will \nbe available to all qualifying local governments. The Project has been prepared using detailed \npilot studies in six local governments3 chosen on a competitive basis, and detailed consultations \nwith 59 more local governments that have formally requested to participate in the Project. \nDescriptions of pilot subprojects are in Appendix 4. \nB.  Project Components \n1.  Component 1: Improved Planning and Management Systems to Upgrade \nSites and Establish New Ones for the Urban Poor \n12.  The objective is to help develop planning systems that cater to the housing needs of the \npoor by helping (i) upgrade and improve poor housing areas as a primary component of the \nGovernment\u2019s stated commitment to \u201cCities Without Slums,\u201d and (ii) deliver new housing areas \nto prevent and preempt the creation of new slums and informal settlements as the city grows. \nThe component will also encourage urban development planning and budgetary allocations, and \nimplementation of pro-poor activities. \n                                                 \n3  Makassar, Mataram, Medan, Pekanbaru, Pontianak, and Tangerang were chosen after considering the proportion \nof their populations in informal settlements, and willingness to contribute resources to the Project. \n ", "4 \n13.  Project  activities  are  to  (i)  develop  systems  for  pro-poor  shelter  within  the  housing \ncomponent of the local Spatial Planning and Shelter Strategy (SPSS),4 (ii) encourage political \ncommitment to these systems, (iii) provide outreach to undertake participatory planning with \npoor communities, and (iv) strengthen coordination with BPN and other agencies relevant to \nshelter  provision  for  the  poor.  In  particular,  the  Project  will  help  develop  an  urban  land \ndevelopment program, especially for housing for the poor. These activities will take place in at \nleast 30 local governments. Local civil-society representatives, constituting an \u201curban forum,\u201d \nwill participate in planning. \n14.  The SPSS and the programming of parallel BPN titling activity will be the key elements \nof this component. Through a series of consultations, the SPSS will consolidate the information \non land availability; priorities for development; strategies for meeting needs, especially of the \npoor;  and  likely  sources  of  finance.  The  SPSS  will  prioritize  site  upgrading,  new  site \ndevelopment,  and  a  time-bound  action  plan  indicating  land  to  be  developed  for  various \npurposes. Cooperation of BPN, defined under its memorandum of agreement with DGHS as \nproviding title documentation for priority projects, is crucial. The HDO will play a coordinating \nrole, bringing together concerned stakeholders, in particular BPN and local governments\u2019 spatial \nplanning  sections,  and  help  them  while  allowing  efficient  and  effective  city  development, \nespecially to acquire land for housing for the poor. Component 1, therefore, will contribute much \nto orderly ready-to-build areas (KASIBA), stand-alone ready-to-build environments (LISIBA), \nland consolidation,5 and housing development. \n2.  Component 2: Improved Access to Shelter Finance by the Poor through \nCentral  Financial  Institutions  and  Local  Financial  Institutions  or  their \nBranches \n15.  The objective is to put in place a financing system that can be accessed by the target \ngroups for physical improvements\u2014from adding additional rooms and repairing and replacing \nroofs and floors, to providing and improving infrastructure and services available, to improving \ntitle  security,  including  plot  purchase.  Loans  will  be  at  market  rates  with  no  interest  rate \nsubsidies. Some 30,000 loans will be made under this component. \n16.  ADB loan proceeds will be relent to central financial institutions (CFIs) to establish a \nhousing finance system accessible to low-income households. CFIs may channel these funds \nthrough local financial institutions (LFIs) to reach target beneficiaries. CFIs have been chosen \non  the  basis  of  capacity  to  deliver  lending  products  to  the  envisaged  beneficiaries.  Bank \nTabungan Negara (BTN) and Permodalan Nasional Madani (PNM) are initially proposed to be \nthe  CFIs.  BTN  will  use  its  extensive  local  branch  network  and/or  LFIs  and  build  on  its \nexperience from related programs to on-lend to beneficiaries. PNM will channel funds mainly \nthrough its network of people\u2019s credit banks, widely regarded as microbanks and a key player in \nmicrofinance. CFIs will establish housing microfinance systems, and LFIs will bear a share of \nthe  loans  to  beneficiaries.  Selected  LFIs  will  undertake  a  program  of  activities:  (i)  raise \nawareness and, with DGHS support, mobilize communities and households to participate in the \nProject\u2014initially in the low-income areas designated by the SCSS, and later in the rest of the \ncity; (ii) form community savings-and-loan groups linked to LFIs, which will mobilize savings and \nchannel the loans to beneficiaries; and (iii) provide, administer, and monitor loans, from Rp2 \nmillion to Rs10 million, which can be guaranteed through group solidarity mechanisms, which \nwere effective in the CoBILD project, or by land titles secured under the Project. The group \nsolidarity guaranty mechanisms operate through individual loans to group members, guaranteed \n                                                 \n4  Rencana Pembangunan dan Pengembangan Perumahan dan Permukiman di Daerah (RP4D) in the Indonesian \nlanguage. \n5  To enable technically and financially viable development. ", "5 \namong group members, while the group provides an assurance to the lender. The mechanism is \na departure from the Grameen group-lending experience and traditional individual loans. If \nbeneficiaries can afford them, the loans can be sequential, used for incremental purchase of \nplots and then construction. \n17.  Because funds are provided at market rates, a sustainable shelter finance system is \nexpected  to  develop  around  CFIs,  which  can  be  expected  to  supplement  the  program  by \nproviding additional funds and resources to low-income households based on an enhanced \nperception of their credibility as borrowers. The capacity-building component will also ensure \nthat the documentation and reporting infrastructure to develop an asset-based securities market \nis in place. In particular, loan documentation will be standardized. \n3.  Component 3: Upgrading of Poor Neighborhoods and Development of New \nSites for the Poor \n18.  The activities of component 1 will help identify, prioritize, and program the activities to \nupgrade  shelter  and  neighborhoods  of  the  poor.  Component  3  will  identify,  design,  and \nundertake the investments required to implement component 1. The two major subcomponents \nare the upgrading of existing areas and development of new areas for housing for the poor. \nAppendix 4 describes each pilot subproject. \n19.  The component targets over 100 poor communities in at least 30 local governments, and \naims to develop at least 10 new housing areas to preempt the formation or extension of slums. \nComponent 1 will identify locations and criteria to select communities and component 2 will set \nup the mechanisms for households and communities to finance house improvements, including \nimproved land tenure and on-plot infrastructure. Investments under component 3 will include \nstreet lighting, storm drainage, public toilets and communal sanitation facilities such as group \nseptic tanks, water mains and public taps, secondary solid waste management, and community \nfacilities. Investments will be identified through a participatory neighborhood upgrading plan \n(NUP) in poor communities. Savings groups involved in component 2 will be included in CBOs, \nwhich will be the community counterpart of the local government for NUPs. \n20.  Proposed upgrading activities include (i) fostering of NUPs in priority poor areas by local \ngovernments,  supported  by  DGHS;  (ii)  DGHS  agreements  with  local  governments  and \ncommunities on cost sharing for investments identified under the SPSS and NUP, and on \noperation and maintenance of investments; (iii) provision of funding for investments; and (iv) \nmonitoring of investments and maintenance by DGHS. Activities for the new sites will be similar, \nexcept that a prequalification process for beneficiaries will ensure affordability. Over 25,000 new \nhousing lots are expected to be created. \n21.  The Project will also fund investments to provide links to city-wide networks of urban \nservices such as feeder roads. As with neighborhood upgrading, which primarily serves the \nneeds of the poor, these investments will be funded through cost sharing by national and local \ngovernments.  The  scale  and  speed  of  provision  will  be  determined  by  SPSS  criteria  and \nprovisions. Component 3 could include, for example, provision of new rental public housing to \nmeet demand from the large numbers of itinerant workers, financed through matching grants. \n4.  Component 4: Strengthened Sector Institutions to Deliver the Program  \n22.  To support project implementation and sector strengthening, DGHS will undertake a \nrange of capacity-building activities to (i) strengthen local government systems for, and train \nlocal  government  officers  and  representatives,  civil-society  representatives,  and  DGHS  to \nundertake  pro-poor  SPSSs;  (ii)  strengthen  central  and  local  financial  institutions,  local \n ", "6 \ngovernment, and DGHS systems, and train officers and civil-society representatives to finance \nshelter for the poor and low-income groups; (iii) strengthen local government systems, and train \nlocal  government  officers  and  representatives,  civil-society  representatives,  and  DGHS  to \nfacilitate, upgrade, and develop sites for the poor and low-income groups; and (iv) enable local \ncommunities to help upgrade shelter and to establish self-help groups. These activities will \ncomplement ongoing related ADB capacity building for urban infrastructure management and \ndecentralization projects. \nC.  Special Features \n23.  The Project addresses the key constraints on provision of affordable shelter to low-\nincome  groups  and  provides  mechanisms  to  enhance  security  of  tenure  where  previous \ninitiatives  have  had  limited  success.  Component  1  facilitates  planning  of  these  initiatives. \nComponent 2 provides incremental financing for lot purchase on affordable terms for the poor \nand through financing mechanisms linked to the formal financial system, thus bridging the gap \nbetween these institutions and the poor. The Project avoids subsidizing interest rates, relying \ninstead on targeted capital subsidies. Component 3 will physically improve slums and develop \nnew, affordable sites for the poor where supply-side policies have failed to keep pace with need. \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n24.  Demand for project activities has been investigated in the six pilot cities, which were \nselected for their regional representation; size (metropolitan, large, and medium); and large \nconcentrations of urban poor. The investigation results formed the basis for costing investments \nin housing microfinance, neighborhood upgrading, and new site development; and capacity-\nbuilding and project implementation support components. Investment size was determined from \nthe 42 participating cities\u2019 cost-sharing proposals.  \n25.  The Project is estimated to cost $126.5 million equivalent, comprising $14.6 million in \nforeign exchange costs (including about $5.9 million in financial charges during implementation), \nand $111.9 million equivalent in local currency costs (Table 1 and Appendix 5).  \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nComponent  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

", "7 \nE.  Financing Plan  \n26.  The Government has requested a loan of $68.6 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) and $20 million from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). The OCR \nloan will have a 25-year term, including grace period of 6 years; an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum; and a front-end fee of 0.50%, to be capitalized in the \nloan, provided it is approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2003. If the loan is not approved in \n2003, the front-end fee will revert to 1%, or such other rate to be determined by ADB\u2019s Board. \nThe ADF loan will have an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter, and a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The project \nfinancing plan is shown in Table 2. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nAsian Development Bank  14.60   74.00   88.6  70.0 \nADF  3.98  16.02  20.0   \nOCR  10.62  57.98  68.6   \nCentral Government  0.00        5.60        5.6  4.4 \nCity Governments  0.00      30.10    30.1    23.8 \nCentral Government  0.00   0.60    0.6  0.5 \nCity Governments  0.00   35.10   35.1   27.8 \nCFIs/LFIs  0.00   0.50   0.5  0.4 \nBeneficiaries  0.00   1.70   1.7  1.3 \nTotal     14.60    111.90   126.5     100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, CFI = central financial institution, LFI = local financial institution, OCR = ordinary \ncapital resources.  \nNote: Figures may not add up to total because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n1.    Financing Mix \n27.  The financing mix for component 2 is based on the use of (i) OCR loan proceeds, (ii) CFI \nand LFI contributions, and (iii) beneficiaries\u2019 equity contributions. About 90% of component 2 will \nbe funded through ADB\u2019s OCR loan. ADF funds will finance all capacity-building activities under \ncomponents  1  and  4.  DGHS  will  contribute  the  incremental  project  administration  and \nsupervision costs of these components. Component 3 is based on the blended use of ADB \nloans and central government\u2019s and participating cities\u2019 counterpart contributions for the cost of \nthe  subprojects.  The  Government  will  partly  subsidize  land  acquisition  costs  for  eligible \nbeneficiaries. Once a grant for site development is approved, the participating local government \nwill first mobilize its own counterpart contributions for activities such as land titling, detailed \nengineering  design,  and  matching  funds  required  to  implement  subprojects.  Appendix  6 \npresents the project financing arrangements and fund flow. \n2.    Relending and On-Lending6  \n28.  Under component 2, OCR loan proceeds will be relent by the Government, through the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), to qualified CFIs through subloans. Loans to CFIs will be on parallel \nterms to the ADB loan. CFI subloans will have a term of up to 15 years, including a maximum \ngrace period of 3 years, an interest rate that will at least cover the cost of ADB borrowing, an \n                                                 \n6  Relending is defined as lending from CFIs to LFIs, and on-lending as lending from LFIs to end-beneficiaries. \n ", "8 \nadministrative fee for the Government, and foreign exchange risk cover, if applicable. CFIs will \ndisburse funds to beneficiaries through LFIs at market interest rates. The cost of CFI funds to \nLFIs will be at market rates. LFIs will, in turn, on-lend to beneficiaries at the market-lending rate. \nDepending on the region, borrower, collateral cover, and period of loan, interest rates may vary \nfrom 14% to 25% per annum. These rates are lower than the annualized interest rates paid by \nthe beneficiaries, ranging from 35% to as high as 120%, due to limited, or lack of, access to \nformal shelter finance. LFI on-lending to beneficiaries will vary from 2 to 10 years. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n29.  DGHS will be the project Executing Agency. It will form the project steering committee \n(PSC), chaired by the National Development Planning Board (BAPPENAS), with members from \nthe National Board for Policy and Supervision of Housing and Human Settlements and other \nstakeholders, and permanent director-level representatives of BAPPENAS, BPN, MOF, Ministry \nof Home Affairs (MOHA), and Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure. The PSC will \nalso include representatives from CFIs and civil society. To ensure committee members\u2019 active \nparticipation, meetings of the director-level PSC will be held at least quarterly, focused on \ndiscussions of project progress, with up-to-date reports from participating cities. These meetings \nwill approve annual budgets and semiannual progress reports. \n30.  DGHS directorates will serve as the PSC technical secretariat, and its services to the \nProject will be consistent with the central Government\u2019s role (i.e., coordinating, monitoring, and \nproviding  technical  assistance  resources  to  participating  local  governments).  The  central \nimplementing agencies will be as follows: (i) component 1\u2014DGHS Directorate of Technical \nDevelopment (DTD), with support from other DGHS technical directorates; (ii) component 2\u2014\nCFIs, with support of the DGHS Directorate of Housing Finance; (iii) component 3\u2014participating \nlocal governments, with support from regional directorates of DGHS and DTD; (iv) component \n4\u2014DTD. Representatives of these agencies will constitute the project management unit (PMU), \nto be headed by, and located within DTD. The PMU will be led by a project director with a full-\ntime project manager, at the level of section head, who will be in place for at least 2 years. The \nPMU  will  also  be  staffed  with  specialists  in  urban  planning,  housing  finance,  community \ndevelopment, and project management.  \n31.  The PMU will manage the Project\u2019s operational support consultants (OSC). The PMU \nwill coordinate project services, but a specialist consultant supervised by PMU and OSC will \nmanage  national  bidding  and  contracts.  OSC  services  will  include  government  staff \ncounterparts,  and  specialists  in  project  coordination  support,  public  information,  quality \nassurance and municipal engineering, program performance monitoring and evaluation (PPME), \nand project accountancy support. The results of this output will be efficient project management \nand enhanced shelter management capacity of national agencies. \n32.  In  each  local  government,  project  implementation  will  be  coordinated  by  the  local \ncoordinating office (LCO). Local governments will be flexible as to the LCOs\u2019 location and will \nnominate an LCO full-time staff to manage the subprojects. LCOs will liaise with CFIs and \ncoordinate activities of LFIs or their branches, and community groups. Existing CBOs will form \nthe basis of the NUP process, articulate community needs and aspirations, and ensure that the \ncommunity is adequately represented in decision making. Civil society will be represented in the \nLCOs\u2019 procurement activities. ", "9 \n33.  Finally, lending under component 2 will be supervised by a financial project management \nunit (FPMU) in each CFI. FPMUs will coordinate with LCOs to ensure that LFIs channel loans \nefficiently and effectively to qualified project beneficiaries. Appendix 7 presents the project \norganizational chart. \n2.  Central Financial Institutions  \n34.  BTN  is  proposed  to  be  a  CFI  for  component  2.7  A  wholly  government-owned \ndevelopment finance institution established in 1950, and focused on housing and property \nfinance, BTN has built up relevant capacity for shelter finance while implementing government-\nsponsored housing finance projects, including housing microfinance. BTN was recapitalized \nafter the 1997 financial crisis and now maintains a relatively good financial standing.  \n35.  While  BTN\u2019s  lending  portfolio  has  remained  constrained  by  a  number  of  economic \nfactors, its deposit mobilization results are encouraging. The bank\u2019s capital adequacy, asset \nquality, management, earnings, and liquidity ratios are satisfactory. To ensure financial viability \nof BTN lending, and sound financial management, BTN will maintain a risk-weighted capital \nadequacy ratio of at least 8%, in keeping with the minimum requirement of Bank Indonesia.  \n36.  PNM,  a  specialized  financial  institution  to  develop  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \ncooperatives (MSMCs), will be the other CFI. PNM runs various financial activities such as \ncredit  programs,  financial  institutions,  and  venture-capital  institutions.  PNM  operates  credit \nschemes through a network of executing banks, provides capital shares to selected microbanks, \nand provides advice and training to MSMCs.  \n37.   PNM has grown rapidly, meeting a clear need to support MSMCs. Its capital adequacy, \nasset quality, earnings, and liquidity ratios are satisfactory. Financial projections conducted for \nPNM over 2003\u20132009, using conservative growth assumptions, indicate a doubling of total \nassets from Rp1,720 billion in 2002 to Rp3,463 billion in 2009. PNM has agreed to maintain \nreturn-on-asset and return-on-equity ratios of at least 1.5% and 10.0%, respectively, to ensure \nits financial viability during the Project. BTN and PNM are assessed as project CFIs in Appendix \n8.  \n3.  Selection and Preparation of Subprojects \n38.  Eligibility  criteria,  selection  mechanisms,  and  subproject  preparation  and  appraisal \nprocedures have been agreed on with the Government and CFIs. The first three subprojects \nunder component 3, and first three subloans appraised by CFIs for  component 2, will be \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval. Subsequent subprojects or subloans will not require \nADB review and approval, unless the subproject or subloan equals or exceeds $2 million. \na.  Eligibility and Selection Criteria for Local Governments  \n39.  The PMU will determine if a local government is eligible for inclusion in the Project, \nbased on the following criteria: (i) significant slum areas suitable for upgrading; (ii) classification \nas a provincial capital, metropolitan city, or large or medium-sized urban area; (iii) financial \ncapacity to provide matching grants required for the Project; (iv) ability to generate surplus \nincome  for  the  next  3  years;  (v)  documentary  evidence  of  endorsement  of  the  Local \nGovernment Assembly and chief executive; (vi) absence of adverse findings from banks and \nsuppliers; and (vii) existence of, or commitment to establishing, a housing unit (to be the basis \n                                                 \n7 BTN has not yet completed its due diligence review of the project financing procedures. \n ", "10 \nof an HDO) or an HDO. A preliminary selection will be made from the long-list of 42 local \ngovernments. \n40.  An area will be eligible for a subproject if it has (i) inadequate housing and services, as \nevidenced by the endorsement of the regional development planning agency; (ii) nationally or \nlocally owned government land with potential for inclusion in the subproject; (iii) interest in and \ncommitment to the Project, expressed by the legal formation of a project CBO or, if already \nestablished under World Bank\u2019s UPP, the CBO provides a document expressing interest and \nwillingness to participate, endorsed by representatives of all households in the area concerned; \n(iv) a local government that can technically and administratively build institutional capacity and \nmanage subprojects; and (v) confirmation from the local government that it has the capacity and \nwillingness to contribute matching grants to the subproject. \nb.  Qualification  and  Selection  of  Central  Financial  Institutions  and \nLocal Financial Institutions \n41.  The PMU will monitor CFIs\u2019 financial position based on criteria in Appendix 9. CFI \nFPMUs will determine the eligibility of participating LFIs and other lending intermediaries. LFIs \nmust satisfy institutional, financial, and lending performance criteria. LFIs able to implement \nmicrocredit programs for the informal sector, conforming to ADB\u2019s microfinance development \nstrategy, will be preferred. CFI project loan officers will assess compliance with accreditation \nrequirements  (Appendix  9)  based  on  information  provided,  including  audited  financial \nstatements. \n4.  Implementation Period \n42.  Project implementation is assumed to start in the first quarter of 2004 and continue for 6 \nyears. The emphasis in the first 6 months will be on (i) finalizing preliminary shelter strategies \nfor the six pilot cities, (ii) implementing NUPs in the cities, and (iii) contacting other project cities \nand preparing SPSS. \n43.  Work in the remaining cities will start with SPSS development and will continue for 2 \nyears, allowing different cities to start at different times, although the identification and planning \nprocess should not last more than 3 months. Similarly, project upgrading in local governments \nother than the pilots will be spread over 3 years, from early 2005 to early 2008. New sites will be \ndeveloped  in  all  project  cities  during  the  last  3  years  of  the  Project.  The  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n5.  Procurement \n44.  Participating  agencies  under  all  components  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. In particular, under component 2, CFIs and LFIs or branches will follow the \nguidelines applicable to development finance institution loans, which include obligations to (i) \ndemonstrate that subborrowers\u2019 procurement procedures are appropriate; and (ii) ensure that \ngoods and services to be financed by loans to end-borrowers are purchased at a reasonable \nprice,  delivered  on  time,  efficient,  reliable,  suitable  for  the  subproject,  have  maintenance \narrangements, and, in the case of services, rendered by quality and competent parties. To \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, DGHS and CFI project managers and staff of \nother agencies engaged in procurement will be trained and briefed in procurement. International \ncompetitive bidding will be used for all civil works contracts of over $2 million, and for supply \ncontracts of over $500,000. International shopping will be used in cases of supply contracts of \nover $100,000 and less than $500,000. In other cases, local competitive bidding procedures will ", "11 \nbe  used,  except  as  specified  below.  To  promote  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, staff of the PMU, FPMUs, LCOs, and other agencies involved in procurement will \nbe briefed and trained in procurement procedures. \n45.  For small areas, typically 2 hectares or less and without technical complications, the \npossibility of using community contracting under ADB\u2019s A Guide on Community Participation in \nProcurement  may  be  considered  if  the  local  community  is  organized  and  committed  to \ncontracting. Where necessary, works should be divided into smaller packages to ensure that \nthey (i) meet the eligibility criteria for community-contracted works and (ii) pertain to a clearly \ndefined community. The finance for these works may be allocated directly to the neighborhood \nadministration as a block grant or be administered by the LCO, depending on local preferences \nand  procedures.  The  PMU  will  clearly  define  procurement  processes  and  supervision \nprocedures. \n6.  Consulting Services \n46.  Specialist  services  will  be  of  two  groups:  (i)  capacity  building  for  shelter  strategy \nformulation,  finance  management,  and  site  development;  and  (ii)  operational  support.  The \ncapacity-building  group  will  be  recruited  centrally  and  deployed  to  participating  local \ngovernments.  Facilitators  will  also  be  recruited  from,  and  deployed  to,  them.  Operational \nsupport consultants will be recruited centrally and deployed to support the PMU.  \n47.  International and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod or other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Around 60 person-months of international \nconsulting, 492 person-months of domestic consulting, and 1,631 person-months of facilitator \nservices will be needed. Consultants will be experts in architecture, planning, engineering, \ncommunity  development,  environmental  services,  economic  and  financial  analysis,  and \nmicrofinance.  An  international  procurement  services  consultant  retained  by  the  PMU  on  a \nseparate contract will recruit all specialist services. The consultant will process all progress \npayment  claims.  Use  of  \u201cperiod\u201d  or  \u201cframework\u201d  consulting  services  contracts  will  make \navailable the specified pool of specialist services to the local governments upon request. \n48.  ADB will finance consulting services for OSC\u2014about 45 person-months international \nand 363 person-months domestic, in shelter planning and financing, microlending systems, and \ncommunity mobilization. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 11.  \n7.  Advance Action on Recruitment \n49.  ADB has approved advance consultant recruitment for project, engineering design, and \ncontract document management, starting with pilot subprojects. The Government has been \nadvised that such advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n50.  To expedite disbursements and improve governance in project implementation, the PMU \nwill consolidate statement-of-expense (SOE) accounts, both from consultant expenditures under \ncomponents 1 and 4, and of the local coordinating offices (LCOs) under component 3. The PMU \nwill review and certify all direct payment claims to ADB, which, in turn, will make the payments \nto the relevant consultants and LCOs. These arrangements will be detailed, reviewed, refined, \nand documented prior to any disbursement for these components.   \n ", "12 \n51.  Under component 2, each CFI will establish an imprest account. The initial deposit will \ncover the estimated ADB financing required by each CFI for the first 6 months. Replenishment \nof these accounts will be based on disbursement to LFIs operating in the target communities. \nThe ceiling of the combined imprest accounts of the CFIs will be $1.5 million. All imprest \naccounts will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed on by the Government and \nADB.  ADB\u2019s  SOE  procedures  will  be  followed  in  liquidating  the  imprest  accounts  and \nreimbursing  individual  SOE  payments  up  to  $200,000  equivalent.  The  involved  agencies\u2019 \ninternal  control  systems  have  been  reviewed  and  found  to  be  capable  of  administering \npayments at this level. \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n52.  The PMU, FPMUs, and LCOs will maintain separate project accounts. The PMU will \nconsolidate CFI and LCO accounts quarterly. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB will audit \nthe consolidated project accounts every year. Certified copies of the audited accounts in English \nwill be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the financial year to which they \nrelate. The independent auditors funded by the Government will also provide a separate audit \nopinion for all imprest accounts and SOEs. If the audited project account is not received within 6 \nmonths after the due date, ADB may stop replenishing the imprest account and processing \nreimbursement requests, commitment letters, and contract awards. If the project account is not \nreceived within 12 months after the due date, ADB may suspend the loan. The PMU will submit \nto ADB quarterly reports on implementation of project-funded activities. The reports will be in a \nformat  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  include  reconciliation  of  project  expenditures  against  ADB \ndisbursements, progress made against established targets, problems encountered during the \nquarter, steps taken and proposed, compliance with loan covenants, and project activities to be \nundertaken during the next quarter. A project completion report will be prepared within 8 months \nof project completion. All reports will be in English. \n10.  Project Supervision and Reporting Requirements \n53.  DGHS and the CFIs will separately submit to ADB semiannual progress reports on \nproject  implementation.  The  reports  will  cover  physical  performance,  summary  profiles  of \nfeasibility  studies,  summary  appraisals  of  applicant  CBOs  and  NUPs,  progress  made  in \ncomponent 2, and progress made in the capacity-building program. Within 6 months after \nsubproject completion, DGHS will prepare and submit to ADB a subproject completion report, \nsummarizing  the  status  of  subproject  implementation  and  operational  performance  and  an \noverview of project progress. Within 8 months after the Project, DGHS and the CFIs will prepare \nand  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  summarizing  the  overall  status  of  project \nimplementation, operational performance, project performance monitoring system, and targets \nachieved. \n11.  Anticorruption Policy \n54.  The Project will comply with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and guidelines. DGHS will \nensure the timely submission of project accounts. Subprojects will be selected, components \napproved, and goods and services procured according to agreed-on guidelines and criteria. \nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the central and local \ngovernments,  CFIs,  and  participating  LFIs.  The  anticorruption  provisions  added  to  ADB\u2019s ", "13 \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants were also discussed, and the section on fraud and \ncorruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement was emphasized.8 \n12.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  The Government will ensure that a comprehensive program for PPME, acceptable to \nADB,  is  carried  out  to  (i)  examine  and  assess  the  project  technical  and  disbursement \nperformance; (ii) evaluate the delivery of the planned infrastructure, facilities, activities, and \nprograms; (iii) assess the achievement of project objectives; and (iv) measure the Project\u2019s \nsocial and economic benefits. The PPME will be integrated into city management information \nsystems to monitor social and economic benefits even after project implementation. Annual \nPPME reports will be prepared by each LCO, and then consolidated by the PMU and submitted \nto ADB, with a copy for the implementing agencies. The integrated system for management, \nmonitoring, and evaluation of project benefits, social impact, and physical improvements will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for the project performance management system. \n56.  The PMU will also implement a structured learning program that will inform project \npreparation for subsequent shelter projects. Structured learning involves setting review topics \nrelating to policy and implementation issues at the start of the Project, and then monitoring \nproject implementation specifically on those topics. ADB and the Government will undertake a \ncomprehensive  learning  exercise  at  the  end  of  the  second  year  when  the  first  batch  of \ninvestment proposals is completed.  \n13.  Project Review \n57.  A midterm  review will  take place about 4 years after loan effectivity to enable the \nGovernment, CFIs, and DGHS to adjust project design and implementation arrangements, if \nneeded.  The  review  will  cover  subproject  preparation  and  implementation,  consultants\u2019 \nperformance, subprojects in the pipeline, assistance to local governments and their poor urban \ncommunities,  microfinance,  institutional  capacity  building,  and  possible  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Institutional Aspects \n1.  National Institutions \n58.  The inclusion of all key national-level shelter stakeholders on the steering committee will \nensure that lessons from the sector will guide project activities. DGHS\u2019s role as key national \ngovernment implementing agency for pro-poor shelter programs will be reinforced, as will the \nrole of DGHS, with BAPPENAS, in facilitating decentralization of shelter planning and provision. \nMOHA\u2019s  roles  in  overseeing  decentralization  and  promoting  community  development  are \nreinforced by the ministry\u2019s membership in the steering committee.  \n59.  Project support for coordination and implementation will increase the capacity of national \nagencies to manage fund flow and specialist services to city governments. Support will include \n(i) consolidating the role of DGHS in project coordination, public information campaigns, project \naccounting  and  financial  management,  and  preliminary  evaluation  of  shelter  investment \nproposals from local governments; (ii) strengthening BPN\u2019s ability to issue land titles in urban \n                                                 \n8  For example, in the case of inappropriate practice, only specific parties, rather than the whole Project, should be \npenalized. In such cases ADB will review the practice, a bid for example, and determine appropriate redress.  \n ", "14 \npoor areas; and (iii) helping new \u201cgood governance\u201d systems of procurement coordinate other \nspecialist services and, especially, give advice on procurement through out-sourced agencies \nand management of framework contracts. \n2.  Local Government and Civil Society  \n60.  The  Project\u2019s  success  in  adding  pro-poor  shelter  dimensions  to  local  government \nplanning and budgeting will rely on enhanced shelter-related institutional arrangements. The \nProject encourages the addition of shelter as a central activity of local government. The Project \nalso  reinforces  the  role  of  local  urban  forums  that  will  work  with  the  LCO,  enhancing \naccountability and transparency at the local level. If the local government does not establish an \nurban  forum,  the  Project  will  facilitate  its  formation  under  component  4.  A  stronger  local \ngovernment shelter institution is required, and component 4 promotes the establishment of \nHDOs  to  institutionalize  a  comprehensive  approach  to  shelter  planning  and  a  pro-poor \norientation for it.  \n61.  The Project will help consolidate the roles of the various stakeholders by providing \nhands-on  training  and  specialist  service  advice  as  shelter  strategies  are  prepared  and \nimplemented  in  the  local  government  annual  planning  and  budgeting  system.  The  Project \npromotes coordination among key local stakeholders, in particular the city planning office and \nlocal BPN office, by supporting the local government housing and settlements board. The \nProject will encourage the establishment and consolidation of neighborhood and community \norganizations, and provide recommended participatory processes and training and specialist \nservice support. The Project\u2019s inclusive shelter-planning intervention will result in short-term \nplans and budgets reflecting priorities of the poor, and of city governments with competent \npersonnel, technology, facilities, and programs to ensure that shelter planning and budgeting \nremain inclusive. \n3.  Local Participating Financial Institutions \n62.  The introduction of small revolving loans for housing through LFIs will not only extend \nthe range of services available to low-income people, but capacity building for these institutions \nwill also enhance their understanding of financial mechanisms and operations, and, through \ncommunity involvement, of communities\u2019 social needs. The establishment of community savings \ngroups  will  encourage  more  households  to  save  beyond  project-related  loans.  With  good \nmanagement and support, a financial institution will be able to establish a virtuous cycle to \nexpand financial services, starting with the poor and then gradually among middle-income \ngroups. \nB.  Poverty and Social Aspects \n63.  In general, better access to urban infrastructure and services improves living conditions. \nSpecifically,  road  improvement  provides  safer,  faster,  and  better  accessibility  to  and  from \npeople\u2019s homes. Better street lighting can deter petty crime, violence, and clandestine activities, \ndirectly  benefiting  women  and  children.  Better  drainage  reduces  flooding  and,  therefore, \nwaterborne  diseases,  destruction  of  property,  and  accidents;  and  prevents  groundwater \ncontamination. The central issue for the Project is that each community will have different \npriorities, and the NUP is designed to enable the community to plan investments.  \n64.  An important project impact is job creation for residents of project communities and \nthose living nearby, increasing income, although temporarily, particularly of the unemployed or \nunderemployed,  and  thus  increasing  capability  to  spend  for  basic  needs  such  as  food, ", "15 \neducation, and health. Increased income will especially benefit the poorest. Indirectly, women \nmay benefit from jobs through the increase in demand for goods and services, which women \ncan provide through microenterprises such as food stalls, barber shops, and room rentals. \n65.  Housing improvement will involve setting up a credit facility for target beneficiaries. \nPhysical improvements can include adding rooms, including toilets and baths; repairing and \nreplacing components; improving facilities (toilet, kitchen, garden); and even purchasing the \nhouse and/or lot. Extra space may be rented out.  \n66.  Involving  women  in  house  design  will  lessen  their  domestic  work.  Home-based \nenterprises and income-generating activities particularly empower women. Indirectly, housing \nimprovement creates jobs for local people and outsiders. The pilot or subsequent subprojects, \nwhich target cities, will not affect indigenous peoples. In the remote eventuality that an affected \ncommunity may have a significant indigenous population, community-driven planning will ensure \nthat ADB\u2019s policy is applied, also minimizing, if not eliminating, the need to acquire land and, \nthus, to employ ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy safeguards. Social and poverty issues are \nin Appendix 12, and the summary resettlement framework in Appendix 13. \n67.  The community organizations and/or associations will greatly benefit from the Project, \nwhich will improve CBOs\u2019 skills, knowledge, and tools to manage and maintain community \ndevelopment interventions. These will establish a sense of ownership and responsibility, which \nwill  reinforce  the  sustainability  of  project  interventions.  Meeting  community  organizations\u2019/ \nassociations\u2019 organizational, management, and advocacy needs will strengthen social cohesion, \nincreasing community cooperation and coordination. Component 4 will also emphasize involving \nthe poor and women\u2019s groups. \nC.  Environmental Aspects \n68.  The Project will have mostly beneficial environmental effects, and adverse effects can be \nmitigated.  Initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  for  the  six  pilot  sites.  All  pilot \nsubprojects,  and  the  Project  as  a  whole,  will  have  a  minor  environmental  impact  during \nconstruction.  Civil  works  are  not  substantial  in  scale  or  cost,  and  mostly  involve  on-site \nimprovement of drainage, roads, footpath networks, and water distribution systems. Mitigation \nmeasures  will  include  ensuring  that  construction  workers  are  briefed  on  how  to  minimize \nnuisance,  and  carefully  planning  excavations  and  other  construction  activities  to  avoid \ndamaging utilities. At most, negative environmental impact will be interference with other utilities \nor temporary increase of solid waste, sewage, dust, or noise during construction. Mitigation \nmeasures will include documentation of works and utilities undertaken, which will be done by \nthe CBO to inform future construction activities; careful design of septic tanks and drainage to \navoid flooding and standing water; and community education on site cleaning and maintenance \nof  infrastructure  provided,  including  septic  tanks.  Recommended  mitigation  measures  are \nsimple and easy to integrate into the project feasibility study and detailed engineering phases of \nsubproject development. The Project will improve access, proper handling, and disposal of \ndomestic wastewater; prevent flood damage; and provide potable water. \n69.  As the Project is a sector project, site selection criteria will include residential safety, \nwhich will have to be supported by adequate environmental assessment. DGHS, assisted by \nproject  capacity-building  components,  will  ensure  that  assessment  and  monitoring \narrangements are in place. Protection and mitigation measures must be recommended and the \nconditions met for their implementation before ADB approves any site development subproject. \n ", "16 \n70.  As the Project involves only small-scale works, none of the pilot subprojects required full \nenvironmental impact assessment under Indonesian regulations, or are classified by ADB under \ncategory A. Almost all subprojects will only require basic-level assessment under the Indonesian \nenvironmental regulations and fall under ADB category B. The Project\u2019s environmental impacts \nare summarized in Appendix 14. \nD.  Economic and Financial Aspects \n71.  The major indicators of the subprojects\u2019 economic viability are summarized in Appendix \n15.  Base-case  subproject  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  15.0\u201344.8%, \nexceeding the 12.0% economic opportunity cost of capital, and confirming the subprojects\u2019 \neconomic robustness. Sensitivity analysis conducted on parameters\u201410% increase in costs, \n10% decrease in benefits, or both, and delayed benefits\u2014showed that EIRRs are vulnerable to \nchanges in anticipated subproject benefits, a risk that needs to be managed by capacity building \nunder component 4.  \n72.  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  ratio,  based  on  direct  economic  benefits  from \nrepresentative suprojects, is 52%, which is significantly higher than the income share of the \nurban poor as estimated by ADB and confirms the Project\u2019s pro-poor impact. The poverty \nimpact analysis is also summarized in Appendix 15. \n73.  The financial capability of the local governments, which will serve as the implementing \nagencies for the Project\u2019s site development component, were evaluated on the basis of their \nfinancial statements and revenue and expenditure forecasts. Cash-flow projections indicate that \nall  six  local  governments  have  the  capacity  to  borrow  for  project  investments.  Financial \nsoundness is  a  criteria  to  select  participating  local  governments.  The  financial  analysis  of \nrepresentative LFIs ascertained their ability to relend to project beneficiaries and repay their \nproposed subloans under component 2.  \n74.  Financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) and financial sustainability projections were \nprepared for the housing loans. FIRRs were not calculated for the site development subprojects \nbecause they have significant subsidy elements. The local governments will eventually recover \nproject subsidies through property taxes. \n75.  Project sustainability is underpinned by ensuring that all institutional stakeholders can \nrecover  costs  and  that  beneficiaries  are  the  recipients  of  targeted  subsidies.  Thus,  local \ngovernments will recover infrastructure costs through land taxes, and financial institutions will \ncharge an appropriate spread linked to their risk and costs. Subsidies are one-time capital \nsubsidies for land costs. \nE.  Risks \n76.  The  project  design  assumes  that  the  Government  will  remain  fully  committed  to \ndecentralization  and  poverty  reduction,  which  is  highly  likely.  Government  advice  on  the \ndevelopment  priorities  of  the  next  medium-term  national  development  plan  confirms  that \ndecentralization  and  poverty  reduction  through  economic  recovery  will  be  core  features  of \nnational development policy. However, progress and stability in macroeconomic management \nduring the 6-year Project is necessary to ensure access to long-term investment funds and the \nability to implement national development policy imperatives. \n77.  The Project assumes that enough city governments will be attracted to participate in the \nProject by the grants and subsidized specialist service mix provided by the central Government ", "17 \nunder component 4. Other cities\u2019 readiness to participate will also be assessed if alternatives \nare necessary.  \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n78.  Indonesia and DGHS have given the following specific assurances, in addition to the \nstandard assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n(i)  Indonesia  will  make  all  administrative  arrangements  for  implementation  and \nensure  that  counterpart  resources  are  provided  on  time.  The  Government, \nincluding CFIs, will thus do everything to promptly disburse funds to qualified \nborrowers. \n(ii)  Indonesia will ensure that DGHS administers the capacity-building assistance \nwith due diligence and transparently. \n(iii)  Indonesia will not consider any subproject that requires significant resettlement. \nIn  any  event,  the  PMU  will,  before  approving  subprojects,  screen  them  for \ninvoluntary resettlement effects, to ensure that no loss of land, income, housing, \ncommunity facilities, and resources occurs that will require compensation to be \npaid  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  Any \ninvoluntary resettlement arising from project land acquisition should conform to \nADB  policy  and  procedures  and  to  the  neighborhood  upgrading  plan  and \nresettlement framework. \n(iv)  Indonesia will ensure that the Project follows the country\u2019s environmental rules \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment guidelines. \n(v)  Indonesia will ensure that all land required for a subproject has title suitable for \nupgrading the land or developing new sites. \n(vi)  DGHS will ensure that, before a subproject is approved, (a) a local CBO is \nestablished  and  staffed,  (b)  an  adequate  neighborhood  upgrading  plan  is \nprepared,  (c)  all  beneficiaries  voluntarily  agree  on  the  plan,  and  (d)  the \nparticipating  local  government  agrees  in  writing  that  a  specified  CBO  will \nrepresent the subproject community. \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n79.  The Loan Agreements will take effect subject to the following conditions: \n(i)  The  execution  and  delivery  of  the  Subsidiary  Loan  Agreement  and  the \nImplementation Agreement, on behalf of PNM, will have been duly authorized or \nratified by all necessary corporate, administrative, and governmental action. \n(ii)  Pilot-city LCOs are established and staffed. \n(iii)  The PSC is established. \n ", "18 \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n80.  Withdrawals from the Loan Account will commence subject to the following condition: \n(i)  Administrative arrangements for disbursement of components 1, 3, and 4, in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  as \namended from time to time, will have been agreed between the Borrower and \nADB. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n81.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe ADB and recommend that the Board approve  \n(i)  the  loan  of  $68,600,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Neighborhood \nUpgrading and Shelter Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; \na term of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 13,890,000 to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n \n26 November 2003 \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  19 \nPROJECT LOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \n(cid:131)  Increase the  (cid:131)  Upward trend in housing  (cid:131)  CFI consolidated \nassets, well-being,  finance to the poor as  records and Bank \nand income  percentage of mortgage  Indonesia statistics \nopportunities for  finance   \nthe urban poor    (cid:131)  DGHS consolidated \nthroughout  (cid:131)  Increased percentage of  records of local \nIndonesia   households with land or  coordinating office \nbuilding-use permit titles  (LCO) \n   \n(cid:131)  Decreased area covered  (cid:131)  BPS statistics \nby \u201cheavy slums\u201d in \nparticipating local \ngovernments  \nPurpose       \n(cid:131)  Increased  (cid:131)  Over 150,000 urban  (cid:131)  DGHS records of  (cid:131)  The central \nprovision of  poor households with  LCO implementation  Government is \nshelter for the  improved shelter, and  and project  committed to \nurban poor  40,000 by midterm  monitoring and  housing for the \n  review  evaluation reports  poor. \nComponents       \n(cid:131)  Improved planning  (cid:131)  Shelter development  (cid:131)  As above  (cid:131)  Local \nand management  strategies prepared in    governments are \nsystems for  standard format in 30  (cid:131)  CFI and LCO  committed to \nupgrading and  local governments,  records consolidated  housing for the \nnew site projects  including 20 prioritized  by DGHS  poor.  \nfor the urban poor  upgrading and new site     \n  subprojects by midterm  (cid:131)  DGHS records of  (cid:131)  LCOs are \n(cid:131)  Improved access  review  LCO implementation  established and \nto shelter finance    and project  function \nby the poor  (cid:131)  At least 30,000  monitoring and  effectively. \nthrough CFIs and  households request  evaluation reports   \nLFIs or branches  finance    (cid:131)  Enough land is \n    (cid:131)  Interviews with key  available for new \n(cid:131)  Upgraded poor  (cid:131)  At least 800 savings  stakeholders  site development. \nneighborhoods  groups formed, 300 by     \nand new site  midterm review  (cid:131)  DGHS records and  (cid:131)  No systemic \ndevelopment for    project monitoring  problems affect \nthe poor, with a  (cid:131)  Up to 30 participating  and evaluation  CFIs and LFIs. \nsustainable  LFIs  reports   \nmaintenance     \nregime  (cid:131)  Proportion of loans in   \n  arrears   \n(cid:131)  Strengthened     \nsector institutions  (cid:131)  Proportion of loan   \nresponsible for  applications approved   \ndelivering the     \nprogram  (cid:131)  Proportion of   \napplications from, and   \napprovals to,   \nhouseholds below the   \n35th percentile   \n ", "20  Appendix 1 \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n(cid:131)  At least 300   \nneighborhood upgrading   \nplans completed,   \nincluding arrangements   \nfor maintenance;

", "  Appendix 2  23 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n \n1.  The Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Program (IUIDP), which included the \nKampung (village) Improvement Program as a core component, attracted the bulk of urban and \nshelter sector support for some 15 years from 1985, with $1 billion invested through externally \nsupported projects. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) cofinanced the first \nIUIDP in 1987. After this, they funded geographically separate IUIDPs. The last of the these will \nfinish in 2003. \n \n2.  IUIDP, while providing needed urban infrastructure in its time, is generally considered to \nbe an inappropriate vehicle for urban investment in the new era of economic recovery and \nreform (including decentralization) as the program was centrally driven and funded with often \nminimal  support  from  local  governments.  Initially,  the  Government  and  funding  agencies \nfocused on immediate poverty reduction projects and programs to meet the challenge of the \neconomic  crisis.  Government  and  donors  have  reviewed  sector  programs  and  focused  on \neconomic  recovery  and  consolidation  of  governance  reforms,  including  decentralization. \nRethinking approaches to the urban and shelter sectors continue as evidenced in the recent \npublication of the World Bank\u2019s Indonesia Urban Sector Review\u2014World Bank\u2019s Urban Sector \nOperational Strategy in an Era of Decentralization, and the continuing refinement of sector \napproaches1 in ADB\u2019s country strategies and programs.  \n \n3.  Bilateral support typically focuses on supporting decentralization, including the United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)-assisted  regional  management  and \nurban development activities. The Government of the Netherlands finances community-based \ninitiatives of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  and the United Nations \nCentre for Human Settlement (UNCHS), which also target the urban poor. The Government of \nthe  Netherlands  also  substantially  funds  ongoing  decentralization.  The  Department  for \nInternational Development (DFID) of the Government of the United Kingdom also contributes to \npoverty reduction projects and, in particular, has substantially funded ADB\u2019s poverty-focused \ntechnical assistance projects. \n \n4.  The financial crisis and decentralization have combined to create problems for delivery \nof donor support to the sectors, as well as the need to deliver different kinds of support. In the \ncourse of the project preparatory technical assistance, a substantial step forward was taken with \nthe issuance of a Ministry of Finance decree, which clarifies procedures and rules for local \ngovernment borrowing from foreign sources. To be operational, however, the decree needs \n(and is receiving) government and donor attention.2  \n \n5.  The lists of relevant, externally supported projects, including recent and proposed non-\nADB and ADB projects, are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  See, for example, Culpin Planning Ltd. 2003.

The population of \nIndonesia reached 203.4 million in 2000, compared to 119.2 million in 1971. Although Indonesia \nhas dramatically reduced overall population growth rate (from 2.32% in 1971\u20131980 to 1.61% in \n1980\u20131999), the urban population continues to grow at about 4.6% per year (1990\u20132000). The \npercentage of the population living in urban areas was estimated at 42.5% in 2000, and is \nprojected to surpass 50.0% by 2010 and 60.0% by 2025. Urban population growth in 1990\u2013\n2000 has been predominantly outside city boundaries. Average annual urban population growth \nrate in 1990\u20132000 inside city boundaries has been 2.11%, and outside city boundaries (but \nclassified as urban), 7.07%. To support the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve \u201cCities Without \nSlums\u201d commitments, the project design has focused on the needs of the urban population \nwithin  city  boundaries.  As  experience  with  the  Project  is  consolidated,  however,  greater \nattention will need to be placed on the peri-urban areas outside city boundaries. \n \n2.  Despite heavy investments in environmental infrastructure, conditions in poor urban \nareas continue to deteriorate and are aggravated by the impact of the 1997 economic crisis. \nAbout 36% of the urban population is estimated to have access to piped water. Although a \nsignificant improvement since 1980, it is far below requirements when compared to the increase \nin  the  urban  population  without  piped  water\u2014from  24  million  to  42  million  during  the  last \ndecade. Only seven cities have installed sewerage systems, and less than 10% of these cities\u2019 \npopulation is connected to a system. Although access to toilet facilities is increasing, frequently \nthese facilities do not provide for safe treatment of human waste. Septic tanks are often poorly \ndesigned, built, and maintained, and drainage systems are often blocked or nonexistent. Key \nissues in solid waste collection and disposal include the weak capacity of local agencies. In \nurban areas, on average only about 50\u201360% of waste produced is collected by a municipal \nservice. \n \n3.  Land  administration  leaves  much  to  be  desired.  The  National  Land  Agency  is \nresponsible for land administration of only 30% of the national land surface, and less than 10% \nof  the  country  is  covered  by  cadastral  maps.  The  number  of  informal  (unregistered)  land \ntransactions is huge. Over two thirds of land registrations are improperly documented. The \nsharing  of  data  between  institutions  dealing  with  land  issues  is  fragmented  and  limited. \nHorizontal and vertical communication is poor and a clear law and policy on land information are \nlacking. \n \n4.  Few initiatives have been undertaken to increase supply of affordable housing lots. The \nmost promising in many respects are the ready-to-build area (KASIBA); stand-alone, ready-to-\nbuild  environment  (LISIBA);  and  land  consolidation.  Typically,  the  regional  development \nplanning agency (BAPPEDA) leads the task force. The local government designates part of the \ncity as a KASIBA project area, and passes this designation as local law, including in it a KASIBA \nmanagement board, which is, in principle, a local public enterprise. It assumes the responsibility \nto plan, implement, and manage KASIBA development, and to acquire the land within the \nproject area but not to exercise any special powers of compulsory acquisition (eminent domain). \nThe management board can then \u201ctender\u201d process to small-site LISIBA developers, and is \nresponsible building infrastructure in cooperation with local public enterprises and governments. \nThe general schema for infrastructure finance is assumed to be that of primary infrastructure \n(e.g., national, provincial roads, water supply, etc.) and will be financed by central and local \ngovernments. All infrastructure within LISIBAs will be financed by their developers. Normal \nprinciples  of  cost  recovery  apply  to  the  management  authority.  However,  few  KASIBA \nmanagement boards exist. The KASIBA-LISIBA boards that have been formed are not yet ", "  Appendix 3  25 \ncapable  of  managing  the  program,  especially  in  land  acquisition,  marketing,  and  property \nmanagement.  They  are  also  not  yet  professional  in  financing  property  management  (e.g., \nDriyorejo of Medan and Surabaya) as most managers and staff do not have enough experience \nin real-estate development. \n \n5.  While housing finance has received considerable attention as the main instrument to \nincrease and improve access to housing, the policy response has often neglected the interests \nof the poor. Subsidies will not reach the poor if the conditions (land title, 30% down payment, \nverifiable income) for access exclude the poor, especially the self- and informally employed. Not \nsurprisingly, 80% of housing has not used any formal housing finance. Even the directives on \nhousing  finance  with  subsidized  interest  and  down  payment  are  unlikely  to  reach  many \nhouseholds  below  the  50th  percentile.  Nevertheless,  the  poor  manage  their  housing  with \nunsubsidized  credit  at  rates  above  40%  (and  double  that  in  2001\u20132002)  from  materials\u2019 \nsuppliers and microfinance lenders from the formal and informal sectors. The only scheme to \nprovide appropriate housing finance for the poor has been Community-Based Initiatives for \nHousing and Local Development (CoBILD), although other microfinance programs allow loans \nto be used for housing. By and large, demand for housing finance for the poor goes unmet, at \nleast by the formal sector. \n \n6.  From  experience  with  the  pilot  cities,  information  on  slum  areas  seriously \nunderestimates the extent of the problem. The sizes of slum, squatter, and village areas (and \ntheir estimated populations) often err by a factor of 2\u20134, and many such areas are completely \nmissing from city development plans\u2019 official inventories. Maps are out of date and inaccurate, \nand  important  physical  features  are  missing.  This  information  deficiency  makes  a \ncomprehensive and prioritized approach to urban upgrading and shelter strategies (including \nidentification of sites with good potential for new affordable housing developments) very difficult. \n \n7.  Areas  that  require  upgrading  have  been  inventoried,  and  while  these  inventories \nconservatively estimate demand,  they have  been used to estimate overall demand. Some \n14,000 hectares (ha) require upgrading now; 17,000 ha will need upgrading in 2010, which will \ncost about $273 million and benefit some 7 million residents. A similar estimate has been made \nfor urban areas outside city boundaries (predominantly in peri-urban areas), but with different \ngrowth-rate and density assumptions. The resulting estimate of demand is that 18,714 ha \nrequire upgrading now; over 37,069 ha will need upgrading in 2010, which will cost about $575 \nmillion and benefit some 14 million residents. Also based on pilot-city experience, demand for \nnew site development has been estimated, and some 10,000 ha are required over 10 years, \nwhich will cost some $310 million and directly benefit some 14 million people. \n \n8.  Demand for housing finance has been derived on the basis of observations in the pilot \ncities and, particularly, the pilot areas. Some 70\u201380% of the poor households own their housing, \neven though their title to the land is often difficult to substantiate. If the overall conditions of their \nsettlements, particularly in terms of access, infrastructure, and most importantly, the right to \nsettlement were upgraded and improved, as is the intention of the Project through the system of \nmatching grants, the preference of most households would be to improve and build upon their \ncurrent housing investment and social capital rather than to build a new house or to move to a \nnew location and build there. The demand for new housing is likely to come from a small \nproportion of existing tenants, and from the 1.6% or so new households formed annually as a \nresult of natural rate of population growth, plus the pent-up demand among existing households. \nAll in all, though, from experience on the CoBILD project and in the subproject sites, demand for \nnew housing is likely to be less than 10%, and the rest is more likely to be for housing upgrading \nand improvement of living conditions. Sample surveys suggest that as many as 80% of the \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \nhouses need some repair, addition, or modification\u2014including infrastructure connections\u2014and \nthat some 30% have carried out some repair or modification recently. CoBILD and subproject \nexperience suggests that at least 10% of these households will borrow, implying about 4,000 \nloans a year for a city of 1 million people. Loan size, based on observed conditions and typical \ncosts of repairs and modifications, would range from Rp1 million to Rp3 million. Loans to \nimprove land title may be as big as Rp5 million. These loans, at the market rate of interest, \ncould be affordable to the poor over 2 and 5 years, respectively. \n \n9.  The  Government  has  included  specific  sector  targets  in  the  national  development \nstrategy  and  established  four  programs  to  implement  these  strategies:  (i)  development  of \nhousing financial institutions, (ii) enhancement of the housing supply and renovation (renewal) \nsystems,  (iii)  enhancement  of  the  housing  facilities  and  infrastructure  services,  and  (iv) \nenhancement  of  the  area  revitalization  and  preservation.  The  Government\u2019s  draft  national \nhousing policy is consistent with the above. The policy has clear objectives: (i) extend the ability \nof the formal housing market to address the needs of a wider range of people, with interventions \nin  land,  infrastructure,  finance,  and  building  standards  and  materials  within  a  community-\nfocused  approach;  (ii)  build  capacity  of  human  settlement  organizations;  and  (iii)  improve \nsupport systems for housing and human settlement development. The Government has also \ncommitted  to  implement  \u201cCities  without  Slums\u201d  by  2010.  This  program  is  focused  on  a \nMillennium Development Goal and is being implemented by the Directorate General of Human \nSettlements through its comprehensive program for slum upgrading being implemented in over \n60 communities. The Project will thus address key issues in the sector: supply of serviced, \ntenured plots; provision of appropriate shelter finance; and strengthening the capacity of sector \ninstitutions. Supplementary Appendix B presents an analysis of the sector institutions, as well as \na policy action plan discussed and agreed on with the Government. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \nSUBPROJECT DESCRIPTIONS \n \nA.  Makassar  \n1.  Makassar (South Sulawesi, eastern Indonesia; population, 1.1 million) is generally low-\nlying and flat, and most of it water table is within 2 meters of the surface. The largest slum areas \nare north, east, and south of the city center, and can be categorized into (i) coastal and riverside \ncommunities\u2014houses on stilts above the water, with the area beneath gradually filling in, partly \nby natural accretion and accumulation of solid waste; (ii) urban slums and villages, which, in \nsome  areas,  merge  into  the  coastal  and  riverside  communities;  and  (iii)  new  informal \ndevelopments in formerly rural areas, most small. Field surveys suggest that the informal slums \nin Makassar cover over 500 hectares (ha). The Project\u2019s first phase will focus on upgrading 192 \nha of slums, and 206 ha more in the following phase, with priority areas identified through the \nshelter  planning  system  enhanced  by  the  Project\u2019s  capacity  building.  Some  150,000  slum \ndwellers will participate and benefit. Beneficiaries will include those living on around 65% of the \ncity\u2019s land area that is low-lying and/or has been reclaimed from either the sea or marshes. \nSlopes  rarely  exceed  1%  and  many  areas  are  subject  to  flooding  during  heavy  and/or \ncontinuous rain, particularly at high tide. Around 50,000 people, many of whom live in low-\nincome areas, suffer from flooding. Many houses are built on stilts.  \n2.  Improvements will benefit 60% of the population of priority areas that do not have access \nto sanitary disposal of toilet wastes. In seafront communities, some people use crude toilets \nconsisting of nothing more than a partly enclosed bamboo frame projecting out over the sea. \nSome  higher-income  households  on-site  pour-flush  latrines  connected  to  leach  pits.  In \nCambaya, people, if they have any sanitation at all, use crude latrines overhanging the sea. \nFurther inland, some households have individual sanitation facilities, which discharge to leach \npits, although residents report that these systems can overflow, partly due to the high water \ntable, although failure to empty full pits may be a bigger factor. Solid waste management will be \nimproved, reversing recent changes in collection arrangements that have drastically reduced the \nfunding available for local solid waste collection services. In parts of Marisso and Cambaya built \nover the sea, garbage is routinely dumped in the water below and around houses, producing a \nstagnant and unhealthy mix of waste, mud, and polluted water. Away from the sea, waste from \nboth these settlements is deposited in open land, whether vacant lots or, as in one area in \nCambaya, a length of drain that is no longer used.  \n3.  Complementing and reinforcing the impact of upgrading investments, a 27.1 ha new site \nwill be developed, benefiting 5,000 poor households; 4,000 shelter improvement loans and \n3,000 starter home loans will be made available to them.  \nB.  Tangerang  \n4.  Tangerang (West Java; population, 1.35 million) is about 27 kilometers (km) west of \nJakarta and immediately south of Jakarta\u2019s international airport. Some 79,000 poor households \nlive in Tangerang, 5,300 of which are very poor. Poor households are found throughout the city, \ntypically comprising 20\u201340% of the total number of households in any given neighborhood. \nMany of the poor live in informal or slum settlements, 74 of which have been identified in \nTangerang. About 102 ha of priority upgrading areas have been identified, and 401 ha will be \nupgraded through the Project\u2019s support, with some 160,000 beneficiaries. The settlements to be \nupgraded do not necessarily share the same characteristics. Some slum areas house high \nnumbers of migrants or temporary settlers, who have come to the city to seek work as laborers \nor factory workers in nearby industrial areas. In such areas, erstwhile agricultural land has been \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \ndeveloped by landowners to provide high-density rental accommodation, which is sometimes in \nbad condition, lacks basic infrastructure and facilities, and is poorly maintained by the owners \nand occupiers.  \n5.  The other type of slum area to be upgraded is owner occupied, with most residents \nemployed in the informal sector as street vendors, mobile food sellers, or pedicab and/or tricycle \ndrivers.  The  neighborhood  may  be  crowded  and  lacking  basic  infrastructure  and  facilities, \nalthough  some  fringe  settlements  are  less  dense.  Low,  unreliable  incomes  mean  that \ncommunity  members  have  limited  capacity  to  finance  neighborhood  infrastructure \nimprovements. They will be recipients of the 4,000 improvement loans.  \n6.  Two areas in Tangerang have sewers: the central area east of the Cisadane River and \nKarawaci area in the south. Most low-income areas are served by on-plot sanitation systems, \nwhich discharge toilet wastes into leach pits. Only about 72% of the solid waste generated in the \ncity is collected. The situation is worse in the priority areas, where secondary collection services \nare at best irregular and at worst nonexistent. Tangerang is generally low-lying, with elevations \nin the range of 0\u201330 meters above sea level, but generally at the lower end. This, together with \nannual rainfall of 1,500\u20132,000 millimeters per year, creates a need for a strategic approach to \nflood management. Areas close to the Cisadane River have special problems caused by flood \nflows from the inland, and the sea tides. In 1996 the drainage system covered about 7,300 ha \n(88% of the developed area). Areas subject to flooding amounted to 180.5 ha (3% of the \ndeveloped area). These were spread throughout Tangerang, but mostly close to the river. \n7.  Complementing and reinforcing the impact of the upgrading investments, a 27.3 ha new \nsite  will  be  developed,  benefiting  some  5,400  poor  households.  Besides  the  shelter \nimprovement loans, 3,000 starter home loans will be made available to poor households.  \nC.  Pekanbaru  \n8.  Pekanbaru is the capital of Riau Province, central Sumatra (population, 610,000). The \nmain built-up area continues to be on the south bank of the Siak River. In 2001 almost 19% of \nthe total population were below the official poverty line, with about 40% vulnerable to poverty. \nPoor households are spread throughout Pekanbaru, with the highest concentrations along the \nbanks of the Siak and around the city center. The population could become even denser. Some \n61 ha have been prioritized for upgrading, with 200 ha more to be upgraded in the second \nphase and identified through the enhanced shelter planning process, benefiting 26,000 poor \nhouseholds. High demand for affordable housing is also likely to lead to the extension of \ninformal development along the banks of the Siak unless housing schemes are developed for \nthe poor. Some 17.7 ha of new site development will be encouraged, benefiting 3,500 poor \nhouseholds. \n9.  In areas without sewerage, wastewater from toilets is normally discharged into either a \nhousehold septic tank or latrine. In priority areas, about 70% of households have access to \nprivate toilets while about 30%, many of whom are renters, use a public facility. In some cases, \nhousehold  latrines  discharged  into  drains,  which  discharged  directly  into  drainage  canals. \nComplementing  and  reinforcing  the  impact  of  the  upgrading  and  new  site  investments, \napproximately 2,600 shelter improvement loans and 2,000 starter home loans will be made \navailable to poor households.  ", "  Appendix 4  29 \nD.  Mataram  \n10.  Mataram is the capital of Nusa Tenggara Barat Province (population, 310,000). Some \n36% of poor households fall into the poorest categories and live in informal areas, including \nvillages,  unregulated  housing  developments,  and  squatter  settlements.  Indeed,  all  three \nsubdistricts (kecamatan) in the city contain slum and squatter areas. About 16% of houses are \nclassified as being in poor condition. Poor housing is found in all areas in Mataram; 59% of \nhouseholds have access to their own toilet facilities, most disposing waste into individual septic \ntanks, many of which are close to wells. The only sewerage is a pilot project in Ampenan Utara, \nwhich will eventually serve 4,000 houses. Factory wastes, particularly those from bean curd \nproduction in residential areas, are also a problem.  \n11.  Mataram Kota has introduced a shared approach to solid waste management, involving \npeoples\u2019 representatives and nongovernment organizations, in deciding the type of system to be \nadopted. Around 60% of total solid waste is delivered to the designated disposal site. Each \nhousehold has waste disposal bags, which are collected by carts and dumped at a temporary \nstorage point. The primary drainage system is provided by the four rivers. Secondary drainage \nis provided by a total of 31.8 km of lined channels. The system also includes 37.7 km more of \nunlined secondary and tertiary channels. The city has 17 areas of standing water covering 22.25 \nha. Flooding occurs mainly on the banks of the Ancar, Brenyoi, Jangkok, and Medang, which \nare affected by sea tides and high flood flows from the river. Regular flooding occurs on 150 ha \nand affects around 18,000 people, including many poor.  \n12.  To address these problems, about 80 ha have been identified for high-priority upgrading. \nA total of almost 130 ha will be covered by the Project. About 14,000 poor households will \nparticipate  and  benefit.  Complementing  and  reinforcing  the  impact  of  the  upgrading \ninvestments, 9 ha of new site will be developed, and some 1,300 shelter improvement loans and \n1,000 starter home loans made available to poor households.  \nE.  Pontianak \n13.  Pontianak (population, 460,000), the capital of West Kalimantan Province, lies across \nthe equator at the confluence of the Kapuas Kecil and Kapuas Landak rivers, some 5 km inland. \nThe city is low-lying, with elevations of 0.1\u20131.5 meters above mean sea level. Most of the water \ntable is within a meter of the surface. The city is also surrounded and divided by about 33 \nsmaller rivers and channels, creating the impression that Pontianak is built on water. Periodic \nflooding is caused by tidal surges and flood flows from the two rivers. Throughout the city, many \nhouses, particularly those of the poor, are built on stilts on land that is periodically or perennially \nunder water.  \n14.  The highest concentration of poor people is in the west, with 38% of the total. Many live \nin  informal  areas,  including  kampungs,  unregulated  housing  developments,  and  squatter \nsettlements. All four kecamatan in the city contain slum and squatter areas. Most priority areas \nin Pontianak are built over swampland. Many houses are constructed on stilts above the water, \nand the area beneath is gradually filled in, partly by natural accretion and accumulation of solid \nwaste. The neighborhoods are connected by wooden walkways. In the older settlements, most \nwalkways  have  been  replaced  by  solid  causeways  surfaced  with  concrete,  but  wooden \nwalkways often remain alongside access routes. Most houses are constructed with timber \nclapboard  walls,  fixed  to  timber  posts  with  corrugated  iron  roofing.  Most  of  the  housing \ndevelopment is along straight paths laid at right angles to the main road. Usually, the main \naccess is raised and filled in, with the paths leading off it being timber planks on a framework \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nraised on stilts. Some 175 ha of upgrading is recommended, with 23 ha in the first phase. A total \nof 21,000 poor households will participate and benefit. \n15.  The upgrading work and associated shelter improvement loans (of which some 1,700 \nwill be required) will enhance incremental improvement, already in evidence. Many housing \nplots will also be gradually filled in with earth, and a whole neighborhood may thus eventually be \nraised above water level. Water may be confined to channels on either side of the road rather \nthan left to find its own course as in poorer, less consolidated areas. In new settlements, the tide \ncreates flows under and around houses. As a result of building, road construction, and land-\nfilling, flows are constricted and the water stagnates in pools. Residents, however, treat the \nwater as if it were flowing and assume that natural flushing will remove litter and debris. In \npractice, such deposits merely clog up the river and further restrict its flow, and what might have \nbeen relatively clean river water is no longer so, although people continue to wash and bathe in \nit. Pontianak has no sewerage. Facilities consist of communal sanitary facilities and on-plot \nlatrines  discharging  to  septic  tanks.  About  65%  of  solid  waste  is  collected.  The  system\u2019s \ngeographical coverage is 80% of the city, but only 65% of households enjoy regular collection \nservices. Pontianak is flat and low-lying and the water table is seldom more than a meter below \nthe surface. The town is where the two main rivers come together, and the tide causes major \nflooding.  Most  low-income  housing  is  on  swamps  and  permanent  standing  water.  Some \ndrainage channels are lined with wooden boards but few with permanent materials.  \n16.  Most low-income settlements are first connected by wooden walkways, then access \nroutes are filled and paved. Many areas have been upgraded under various kampung (village) \nimprovement  programs  (KIPs)  but  many  concrete  pavements  provided  in  the  1980s  have \nstarted to deteriorate and need repair and rehabilitation. In other areas, concrete paving slabs \nhave settled unevenly, perhaps because the land was poorly consolidated before they were laid, \nand, ideally, should be replaced. Complementing the upgrading investments, some 12 ha of \nnew site development is proposed along with some 1,300 new site loans. \nF.  Medan  \n17.  Medan (population, 1.9 million) is the capital of North Sumatra Province. In 2000 around \n11.7% of the total population was classified as poor, and 46 slum areas were identified. Main \nproblems are insufficient drainage, lack of sanitation, and lack of water. Most housing provided \nfor and by the poor is informal. Priority sites in Medan are generally in inner city slums and \nfringe and coastal areas:  \n(i)  Unregulated subdivisions on dry land. These are found mainly but not exclusively \naround the city center and are characterized by rectangular grid layouts, with \nfairly  generous  rights  of  way.  Most  houses  appeared  to  be  owned  by  their \noccupiers, although some smaller units for rent have been built.  \n(ii)  Village-type developments on dry land. These are widely scattered. Some are \nfairly close to rivers on land that is subject to occasional flooding but not directly \non the riverbanks. \n(iii)  Unregulated subdivisions over swamps and tidal flats. These are mainly around \nthe Belawan port. All started as houses on stilts over water, with access via \nwooden walkways. Over time, fill may be used to consolidate the land below the \nhouses, and wooden walkways are replaced by solid causeways. However, this \nprocess can take many years and is mainly confined to areas on the edges of ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nsettlements close to the shore. The priority sites occupy an estimated 220 ha, \nand  will  involve  about  26,000  households  and  2,400  complementary  shelter \nimprovement loans. \n18.  Some inner city villages and unregulated land subdivisions could be connected to the \ncentral sewer system, but most people rely on some form of on-site disposal, usually a septic \ntank discharging effluent into a latrine. Most sanitation facilities are likely to involve on-plot \ndisposal, which needs tank and/or pit de-sludging. Settlements built over tidal mud flats have no \nproper sanitation facilities, relying on the tide to remove fecal material from below the houses. \nThose built on consolidated fill or on dry land usually have basic facilities, but need considerable \nrationalization and improvement.  \n19.  Only about 65% of the solid waste is collected and delivered to the local government \nsanitation service, partly because service coverage is only about 35% of the kota area, and \nmany  low-income  areas  have  no  regular  collection  service.  Flooding  occurs  along  the \nriverbanks but also elsewhere, especially in low-income areas, which are often on low-lying land \nor close to rivers. Flooding problems are exacerbated by the limited capacity and extent of the \ncity network system, inadequate drainage channel maintenance, and lack of community concern \nwith keeping drainage channels clear.  \n20.  Medan has general problems with road infrastructure but these have a limited impact on \nlow-income areas. Many roads and paths in low-income settlements have been upgraded under \nvarious KIPs but could be improved. In particular, some sea and riverside settlements rely on \nwooden  walkways  for  access.  Some  of  these  are  in  poor  condition.  Complementing  and \nreinforcing the impact of the upgrading investments, some 17 ha of new sites will be developed, \nand 1,800 starter home loans made available to poor households. \n ", " \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  3\n2\n   \nTable A5.1: Cost Estimates, by Expenditure Account \n  A\n  (Rp million)  ($ million)  p\np\nExpenditure Account  Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total  e\nn\nd\nExchange  Currency  Exchange  Currency  ix\nInvestment Costs               5\n \n1.

", "  Appendix 8  35 \nASSESSMENT OF PARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS \n \nA.  Central Financial Institutions  \n1.  Bank Tabungan Negara  \n1.  The  state-owned  Bank  Tabungan  Negara  (BTN),  established  in  1950,  has  become \nIndonesia\u2019s leading bank in housing finance. In 1974 BTN was appointed as the housing credit \nfinancing institution to cater to the needs of low- and medium-income families. Today BTN still \nfocuses on housing finance, lending to medium- and low-income groups, and real estate and \nhousing-related construction. As of December 2002 BTN had 42 branches, 39 auxiliary branch \noffices, and 93 cashier offices, a number of which are in the Project\u2019s pilot cities.  \n \n2.  As of December 2001 BTN\u2019s total assets stood at Rp26,509 billion. Its total liabilities \nwere Rp25,678 billion while its net income was Rp124 billion. Indicators of BTN\u2019s performance \nconfirm its financial soundness and viability. In 2001 BTN\u2019s return on assets and return on \nequity were 0.5% and 15.0%, respectively. The bank\u2019s capital adequacy ratio was 10.85%, \nexceeding Bank Indonesia\u2019s requirement of at least 8.00%. The percentage of its nonperforming \nloans  was  4.75%,  better  than  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  limit  of  5.00%.  BTN\u2019s  improved  financial \nperformance can largely be attributed to better management and shift away from subsidized to \nmarket-based housing loans.  \n \n3.  BTN  plans  to  continue  to  operate  viably  and  profitably  in  the  next  6  years  by  (i) \ngenerating more low-cost deposits as its primary source of funds for lending and investments; \n(ii) maintaining sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawals; (iii) preserving its profitability by \napplying good corporate governance practices, adopting advances in information technology, \nand engaging in more market-based lending operations; and (iv) practicing prudential banking \nby ensuring, among others, that its capital adequacy and nonperforming loans ratios comply \nwith Bank Indonesia requirements. All these will be undertaken by BTN within the context of a \ngenerally improving economy, stimulated by lower interest rates and higher levels of investment. \nBTN\u2019s total assets are estimated to exceed Rp100,000 billion by 2009. The proposed ADB \nsubsidiary loan will account for at most 0.1% of BTN\u2019s current assets and will thus have minimal \nimpact on the bank\u2019s overall financial condition. BTN\u2019s comparative financial statements and \nprojections in 2000\u20132009 are in Table A8.1. The bank\u2019s financial ratios are in Table A8.2 \n \n2.   Permodalan Nasional Madani  \n \n5.  Permodalan Nasional Madani (PNM) was established in June 1999 as a specialized \nfinancial institution to develop micro, small, and medium-sized cooperatives (MSMCs). PNM \nruns  various  financial activities  such  as  credit  programs,  financial  institutions,  and  venture \ncapital. PNM holds minority capital subscriptions in several microfinance institutions, including \nPNM  Baitul  Maal  wa-Tamwil,  Prime  Save  and  Loan  Cooperative,  and  Bank  Perkredita  in \nRakyat/Syariah.  To  efficiently  serve  the  MSMC  sector,  PNM  is  organized  into  the  credit \nprogram, micro-syariah financial institution, and management services divisions. They operate \ncredit  schemes  through  a  network  of  executing  banks,  provide  capital  shares  to  selected \nmicrobanks, and provide advice and training to MSMCs.  \n \n6.  PNM\u2019s total assets reached Rp1,719 billion in December 2002. The biggest component \nof these is accounts receivable from various credit schemes, comprising almost 60% of the \ncompany\u2019s total assets. Total liabilities of PNM were registered at Rp1,349, constituting 78% of \n ", "36  Appendix 8 \nits total assets base, with Bank Indonesia as its biggest creditor. Total revenues generated by \nPNM from its various financing programs amounted to Rp104 billion. Its net income of Rp37 \nbillion in 2002 represents more than a doubling of the net income in 2000 during the bank\u2019s first \nyear of operation. PNM\u2019s return on assets and return on equity ratios in 2002 were 2.2% and \n9.9%, respectively, indicating the bank\u2019s financial robustness and adherence to sound financial \nmanagement practices.  \n \n7.  Financial projections conducted for PNM over 2003\u20132009, using conservative growth \nassumptions, will result in doubling of its total assets from Rp1,719 billion in 2002 to Rp3,463 \nbillion in 2009. These projections confirm that PNM is committed to generating internal funds \nthrough  effective  credit  programs  that  translate  into  a  steady  increase  in  net  profits,  from \nRp37.76 billion in 2002 to an estimated Rp149.49 billion in 2009. PNM is also dedicated to \npracticing good governance, which will enable the bank to consistently improve its earnings \nbefore tax margins of 43% in 2002 in the coming years.  \n \n8.  The  proposed  ADB  subsidiary  loan  will  generate  incremental  net  cash  inflows  and \npositive financial internal rates of return that will enable PNM to effectively service its debt under \nthe  Project  through  timely  repayments  of  local  financing  institutions  (LFIs)  (Supplementary \nAppendix F). Table A8.3 presents the comparative financial statements of PNM for 2000\u20132009. \nTable A8.4 summarizes the historical and projected financial ratios of the company.  \n \nB.  Local Financial Institutions \n9.  BTN and PNM will channel their funds for on-lending to project beneficiaries through \nLFIs.  BTN  proposes  to  use  its  extensive  branch  network  all  over  the  country,  whenever \nappropriate, for its on-lending activities. PNM and BTN, however, recognize that people\u2019s credit \nbanks (BPRs) generally have the credentials and experience to serve as effective conduits of \nhousing  microfinance  at  the  local  level,  particularly  for  the  Project\u2019s  targeted  urban  poor \nhouseholds.  \n \n10.  BPRs  are  widely  regarded  as  microbanks.  In  2002  an  estimated  2,153  BPRs  had \naggregate  assets  valued  at  Rp6.7  trillion.  BPRs  are  supervised  by  Bank  Indonesia  using \nregulations that have been modified over the years to reflect standards suitable to microbanks. \nMore than 70% of BPRs have been rated sound or fairly sound by Bank Indonesia. PNM has \nestablished working and financial relationships with over 300 BPRs.  \n \n11.  Assessments of representative BPRs\u2014Bank Pasar Kabupaten Pantul in Semarang, and \nKarya Bakti Ugahari in Medan\u2014confirm that they are financially viable and adhere to systems \nthat can effectively on-lend to the Project\u2019s targeted urban poor beneficiaries. Both BPRs have \nfinancial performance indicators that (i) comply with capital adequacy and nonperforming ratios \nmandated by Bank Indonesia, (ii) exhibit profitability, (iii) indicate healthy levels of liquidity, and \n(iv) demonstrate the ability to preserve asset quality.

Objectives, Policy Framework, and Eligibility \n1.  The Project is based on a participatory and  community-led approach to development, \nimplying that upgrading interventions\u2014better roads, drains, and water supplies\u2014in the community \nare conceptualized, designed, planned, and implemented by the urban poor themselves, within the \nneighborhood upgrading plan (NUP) process, in close collaboration with the local government that \ngoverns them, and guided by sound urban planning, social, and environmental principles. It is \nintended that such an approach will make the Project adaptable and sensitive to local situations \nand  capacities  of  communities  and  local  governments.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  all  the \nsubgroups within a community are involved, particularly the poorest of the poor and women, who \nare  often  the  most  marginalized  and  least  heard.  The  Project  provides  for  their  adequate \nrepresentation and mechanisms for consulting with them, thereby ensuring that their needs and \naspirations are adequately considered. \n \n2.  Project  features  that  could  call  for  the  application  of  the  resettlement  policy  are  the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Due to the Project, beneficiaries may have to suffer house damage or loss, which \nneeds to be documented and compensated. \n(ii)  Beneficiaries may have to suffer income loss or unplanned relocation expenses, \nwhich should be covered by a relocation subsidy. \n3.  The key elements of the land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) strategy are that (i) \nsubproject selection criteria ensure that site acquisition will not involve the exercise of eminent \ndomain; and (ii) participatory planning guarantees that minor land losses caused by re-blocking \nwithin the site are freely contributed by affected informal settlers, if needed, and replaced through \nvoluntary land redistribution. To enable the rehabilitation of those affected by upgrading, serviced \nplots will be priced at affordable rates, house losses will be compensated at replacement cost, and \nrelocation subsidies provided. If involuntary land losses to formal settlers occur, they will be fully \ncompensated in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy.  \n \n4.  The  following  households/persons  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  for  involuntary \nresettlement: \n(i)  owners of private properties that will be affected by the Project\u2019s right-of-way (ROW) \nrequirements, \n(ii)  owners of improvements on private properties that will be affected by the Project\u2019s \nROW requirements, \n(iii)  owners  of  dwelling  units  within  the  project  site  that  will  be  completely/severely \ndamaged due to the planned site development, and \n(iv)  households or persons whose sources of livelihood will be adversely affected or \npermanently dislocated by the proposed developments in the community. \n ", "    Appendix 13  49 \nB.  Socioeconomic Profile \n5.  Given the lack of official data at the community level, a participatory approach was used to \nmeasure poverty in the pilot communities. Under this, the project preparatory technical assistance \nused participatory rapid appraisal techniques and household surveys to determine the dimensions \nof poverty in the pilot communities. The tools and strategies used for the surveys included the \nfollowing: \n(i)  participatory rapid appraisal techniques; \n(ii)  community stakeholders workshops to assess poverty and social issues both for \nmen and women; \n(iii)  socioeconomic surveys of pilot communities;  \n(iv)  transect walks; and \n(v)  semi-structured  interviews  with  local  community  leaders,  women,  micro-\nentrepreneurs,  traders,  and  other  personalities  from  different  socioeconomic \nbackgrounds. \n \n5.

The NUP is intrinsically a consultative process but, to ensure its proper functioning, civil \nsociety and the range of stakeholders will monitor the outcomes and invite submissions. The \nresettlement framework will be distributed in all communities and disclosed to ADB and in each \napproved NUP. Eventual grievances will be first lodged at the community level to a community \ngrievances committee. If within 2 weeks the case is not settled, the complainant will lodge the \ngrievance to the neighborhood level.

This  section  presents  the  summary  of  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE) \nfindings  and  recommendation  conducted  on  proposed  upgrading  subprojects:  Makassar, \nMataram, Medan, Pekan Baru, Pontianak, and Tangerang. The conduct of the IEEs has allowed \nthe  Project  to  identify  environmental  impacts  and  to  propose  mitigation  measures.  The \nprocedure  adopted  in  identifying  all  significant  environmental  impacts  follows  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \nB.  Description of the Project and Environment \n2.  All subprojects involve small-scale civil works such as local roads and drains to improve \nthe environment of poor neighborhoods. Common to all subprojects is the generation of small, \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  during  design  and  construction.  The  civil  works  are  not \nsubstantial in terms of scale and cost, and are mostly on-site improvement of drainage, road, \nand  water  distribution  systems.  In  particular,  the  proposed  infrastructure  works  in  the \nsubprojects, by their very nature, mitigate environmental impacts and reduce the inherent health \nrisks attributable to the unplanned development of these poor urban communities. However, the \nsubprojects\u2019  high  population  density  multiplies  small  environmental  impacts  and  warrants \nattention, particularly in the planning stage.  \n \n3.  The  proposed  subprojects  will  upgrade  communities  with  limited  available  land. \nUnplanned house construction and haphazard provision of drainage canals and water lines \ninstalled by individual settlers cause most significant environmental impacts. Since existing \ndrainage and water lines are in the same trench and usually follow the alignment of alleys and \nfootpaths,  any  improvement  of  these  services  will  have  negative  impact  on  the  local \nenvironment, but the effects are short term even within a longer construction stage. A more \ndetailed description of each subproject is in Appendix 4. \n \n4.  The environment of the subproject sites is already urban, albeit poorly serviced. No \nsignificant species of flora or fauna were found. Topography varies but is generally flat. Soil \nconditions also vary from sandy soils to clay.  \n \nC.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n5.  Impacts that are common to the subprojects and recommended mitigation measures are \nin  Table  A14.  These  recommended  measures  are  simple  and  easy  to  integrate  into  the \nfeasibility  study  and  detailed  engineering  phases  of  each  subproject  development.  Other \nimpacts, such as silt runoff and relations between workers from other areas and local residents \nwill be managed, if necessary. \n \n ", "54  Appendix 14 \nTable A14: Subproject Environmental Impacts and \nTypical Recommended Mitigation Measures \n \nImpacts  Recommended Mitigation Measures \nEnvironmental problems due to design \nInterference with other utilities in  With the residents and local water utility, prepare a detailed map of each \nsame trench  residential/subdivision block showing the alignment of existing water lines. \nPrepare an excavation schedule of each section of the proposed drainage \nsystem that avoids or minimize interference with water line. \nIntensification of water pollution  With limited available area combined sewer and drainage canal is \ncontrol  recommended. Prohibitive cost of centralized sewerage treatment plant \ndoes not allow its construction. Ensure that all households have specific \ntank and are regularly de-sludge to ensure their proper operation. \nWhen possible, reuse domestic wash water from bathrooms and sinks for \nirrigation. \nCreation of sewage/sanitation  Cover all open drainage canals along the major roads with concrete slabs. \nproblem  Ensure that all households have septic tanks and they are regularly de-\nsludged. Educate the community in the importance of regular maintenance \nand educate contractors on proper procedures of removal and disposal. \nWhen feasible, convert footpaths and alleys to covered drain to ensure \nadequate canal capacity, optimize available space, and minimize health risk. \nEnvironmental problems in construction stage \nHazards to workers and nearby  Educate all construction workers on handling sewage. Equip workers with \nresidents from communicable  proper protective gear such as rubber gloves and boots. To minimize \ndiseases and emissions of dust,  nuisance, heavy equipment operation should be done during daytime (9:00 \nfumes, noise and vibrations  a.m.\u20136:00 p.m.). Inform affected residents before equipment operation. \nAccidental damage to utilities in  Based  on  the  detailed  map  showing  the  location  of  water  pipes  and \nthe same trench  excavation map, inform affected residents of possible disturbances in water \nsupply. Drainage canals to be constructed along/as footpaths that will affect \naccess should be done in phases and immediately covered by metal sheets \nor catwalks to allow access of residents.  \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management System \n6.  As  all  subprojects  envisaged  will  not  have  significant  environmental  impacts, \nparticipating local governments will be required to obtain the relevant environmental impact \nanalysis  (AMDAL)  or  environmental  impact  assessment/environmental  impact  mitigation \n(UKL/UPL) clearance. This will require consultant support to the PMU, which the Project\u2019s \ncapacity-building component will provide while institutionalizing capacity within DGHS. \n \n7.  The  environmental  management  system  is  integrated  into  the  subproject  approval \nprocess and the neighborhood upgrading plan (NUP) process. An environmental assessment \nand review procedure has been prepared and no subproject will be approved by the PMU \nwithout environmental clearance. The steering committee will monitor compliance with this \nprocess. The NUP process is a consultative one that designs project interventions, including \nenvironment-related  interventions  with  the  community  concerned,  and  written  approval  of \nproposed activities is required from all members of the community (see below).  \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n8.  Ample  opportunities  for  the  public  to  participate  in  the  design  process  of  all  the \nsubprojects were ensured: \n \n ", "    Appendix 14  55 \n(i)  Structured subproject site contacts with the officers of community associations, \nlocal government officials, and DGHS regional officers. In addition to standard \npractice in subproject preparation where environmental impacts are identified \nand evaluated, these contacts provided an opportunity for the local community to \nprovide feedback on environmental issues. During each study team visit, at least \nthree rounds of these contacts were conducted. \n(ii)  Workshops were conducted where the subproject initial design was developed \nand ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines explained in the context of the Project. The \nconsultant primarily informs the community of the environmental impacts of the \nsubproject. This workshop also validates the consultant\u2019s assessment of the \nimpacts. During these workshops, the need to comply with local environmental \nregulations is also emphasized.  \n(iii)  A discussion with the local environmental agency is conducted to present in \nsummary the findings and initial recommendations of the study team. Issues \nraised  during  the  walkthroughs  and  workshops  are  revalidated.  During  this \ndiscussion  any  issues  raised  by  the  agency  are  addressed  or  agreements \nreached as to how to address them. \n(iv)  A socioeconomic and perception survey was conducted to provide a baseline for \nassessment of residents perceptions of, among other things, the environment. \n \n9.  The NUP is a product of an intensive consultation process as it is embodied by the \nprinciple of participatory planning and community-led approach to development. This implies \nthat interventions in the community are conceptualized, designed, planned, and implemented by \nthe members themselves in close collaboration with the local government that governs them \nand guided by sound urban planning, social and environmental principles. Thus, the NUP is the \nresult  of  consensual  agreements  that  could  only  be  achieved  through  constant  interaction \namong  those  involved.  Aside  from  including  a  documentation  of  the  public  consultations \nundertaken, the NUP outlines the subproject proposals and designs that were determined by \nthe community members themselves.  \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n1.  Beneficial Impacts \n10.  There will be significant environmental benefits directly and indirectly attributable to the \ninfrastructure proposals within the Project. The main beneficiaries will be all vulnerable groups, \nincluding women, children, and old people. The improvements in most neighborhood upgrading \nareas will include an improved and dependable clean water supply, improved sanitation facilities \nand off-site treatment and disposal, improved solid waste collection and transportation, and \nimproved access roads and pathways. \n \n11.  The provision of new sites with infrastructure will also benefit all incoming residents, \nespecially women, children, old people, and other disadvantaged groups. \n \n12.  In most instances it is likely that the overall environmental benefits will outweigh any \nlocalized  adverse  impacts.  Nevertheless,  the  scale  of  these  adverse  impacts  should  be \ndetermined, and mitigation and management proposals provided wherever necessary. \n \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \n2.  Adverse Impacts  \n13.  To define adverse impacts of all general infrastructure proposals, an IEE has been \ncarried out to determine the specific environmental requirements necessary: full environmental \nassessment  report,  environmental  monitoring  and  management  report,  or  no  specific \nrequirement.  Generalized  proposals  have  been  prepared  for  site  upgrading  and  new  site \ndevelopment and have been used in the IEE. \n \n14.  Based on a general understanding of the type of infrastructure projects proposed as part \nof this Project and on previous experience in the Integrated Urban Development and Poverty \nReduction  Project,  no  projects  will  require  full  environmental  impact  assessment  (AMDAL) \nunder Indonesian regulations, or fall within category A of ADB classification. The infrastructure \nprojects are small-scale, benign, and do not cause significant adverse environmental impacts. \nDetailed assessment of the subprojects is set out in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nG.  Conclusions and Recommendation \n15.  The nature of the proposed subprojects, being community upgrading, will fundamentally \nimprove the urban environment through improved access, proper handling and disposal of \ndomestic wastewater, avoidance of flood damage, and provision of potable water. Also inherent \nin this type of subproject is the dense population living on the construction site; even simple \ndrainage canal excavation, therefore, will have an impact, albeit small and short. \n \n16.  The Project emphasizes the importance of conducting an IEE to identify environmental \nconsiderations during subproject site identification, design, and feasibility analysis. The findings \nand  recommendations  enriched  the  engineering  designs  to  incorporate  simple  mitigation \nmeasures such as dust suppression, timing of heavy equipment operation to avoid disturbances \ndue to noise, proper handling of domestic wastewater and its re-use for irrigation purposes, and \ntraditional construction practices that overlook these mundane impacts. The IEE also pointed \nout  the  need  to  revise  the  engineering  designs  to  avoid  adverse  environmental  impacts, \nreducing potential risk of erosion and groundwater contamination, among others. \n \n17.  Local governments will need to ensure that all subprojects secure an AMDAL clearance \nor UKL/UPL. With minimal reformatting of the IEE, the subproject proponents will be able to \ncomply with government environmental impact statement guidelines.  \n ", "Appendix 15  57 \nECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, AND POVERTY IMPACT ANALYSES \nA.  General \n \n1.  The  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  six  project  sites  were  undertaken  in \naccordance with the following Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines: (i) Framework for the \nEconomic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Project, (ii) Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, (iii) Guidelines for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial \nAnalysis  of  Projects,  and  (iv)  Bank  Criteria  for  Subsidies.  This  appendix  summarizes  a \nsupplementary appendix, which provides the detailed calculation of economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRRs) for all subprojects, and the financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), which were \ncomputed for the revenue-generating components.  \n  \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n2.  The proposed upgraded neighborhoods and new site subprojects will address the land-\nownership issue and distribute individualized titles or other forms of secure tenure instruments. \nThe subprojects will also provide basic services such as roads and footpaths and drainage \nfacilities to (i) increase residents\u2019 access to jobs; (ii) reduce damage, losses, and waterborne \ndiseases due to flooding; and (iii) improve community sanitation by increasing the sewage \nconveyance capacity of drainage canals. Benefits from the housing microfinance components \nwere  quantified  either  by  imputing  the  potential  increase  in  property  rental  values  after \nsubproject  completion  or  by  converting  into  economic  benefits  the  potential  stream  of  net \nincome flows accruing to the borrowers.  \n \n3.  The major indicators of the economic viability of the proposed upgrading subprojects are \nsummarized in Table  A16.1. Base-case EIRRs calculated for the  subprojects ranged from \n15.0% to 44.8%, exceeding ADB\u2019s 12.0% economic opportunity cost of capital, and confirming \nthe  subprojects\u2019  economic  robustness.  Sensitivity  analysis  conducted  on  parameters  that \ninclude  10%  increase  in  costs,  10%  increase  in  benefits,  or  both,  and  delays  in  benefit \nrealization  showed  that  the  EIRRs  will  be  highly  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the  anticipated \nbenefits from the subprojects. Due to the short-term nature, low capital input, and high product \nturnover of representative activities to be financed, the calculated EIRRs for the housing finance \nsubprojects were robust, at 32.6%. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \n4.  FIRRs  and  financial  sustainability  projections  were  prepared  for  the  housing \nmicrofinance component as the only revenue-generating component. FIRRs were not calculated \nfor the upgraded neighborhoods and new sites pilot subprojects because all six will either adopt \nan on-site upgrading approach and their beneficiaries had limited ability to pay, or due to the \nspillover  benefits  of  the  proposed  off-site  infrastructure  to  other  communities  outside  the \ntargeted upgrading sites, some degree of local government subsidy to the Project would be \ndeemed justified. The local governments will eventually recover these subsidies through the \nappropriate property taxation mechanisms. \n \n5.  The  major  indicators  of  the  financial  viability  of  the  proposed  subprojects  are \nsummarized in Table A15.1. The shelter finance subcomponent is highly viable, with base-case \nFIRRs of 62.5%, above the computed real weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%.  \n ", "58  Appendix 15 \nTable A15.1: Economic and Financial Analyses Summary \n  \n    1  2  4  5 \nSubproject  Base   Capital   Benefits  Combined  Benefits  \nEconomic Analysis  EIRR  Costs + 10% less 10%  1+2  Delayed 1 Year \nUpgrading Pilot Makassar  40.3%  36.8%  35.6%  32.7%  30.0% \nUpgrading Pilot Pekanbaru  21.7%  19.8%  19.1%  17.4%  17.5% \nUpgrading Pilot Tangerang  40.3%  36.8%  35.9%  32.7%  30.0% \nUpgrading Pilot Pontianak  24.6%  22.4%  21.7%  19.6%  16.5% \nUpgrading Pilot Mataram  44.8%  40.9%  39.9%  36.4%  32.7% \nUpgrading Pilot Medan  15.0%  13.6%  11.8%  12.0%  10.2% \nMicrohousing Loans LFI  32.6%  28.8%  28.1%  24.9%  23.9% \nNew Site Tangerang  21.2 %  19.3%  19.0%  17.2%  17.5% \n      Collection  Revenues \nSubproject  Base  Costs + 5% Efficiency  Delayed 1 \nFinancial Analysis  FIRR  less 5%  Year \nMicrohousing Loans LFI  62.5%  35.2%  24.1%  2.23% \n EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, LFI = local financial institution, \n O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Poverty Impact \n \n6.  Poverty impact assumptions applicable to the Project are in Supplementary Appendix F. \nPilot  project  consumer  benefits  were  calculated  by  deducting  the  financial  payment  of \nbeneficiaries from their calculated economic benefit. The poverty impact of benefits accruing to \nGovernment and the labor component of the civil works and housing constructed was also \ncalculated. Table A15.2 shows the calculation of the poverty impact ratio derived from the \nexperience in pilot sites. These are representative of the size and type of investments and, \nbroadly, of the project communities. Thus, the benefits and costs associated with the various \ncomponents have to be increased to calculate the actual poverty impact of the whole Project. \nThese factors are increased in proportion to the relative size of the full project component to the \npilot component. The \u201csize\u201d of the component is measured in terms of number of households \nimpacted or loans as appropriate.  \n \nTable A15.2: Summary Project Poverty Impact \n(Rp million) \n \n           \nBenefit  Project  Impact on Other Stakeholders  Total  Total \nCategory  Consumer  Government    Labor    Poverty  Benefits \nImpact  Capital  O&M    Capital  O&M  Total  Impact \nMicrofinance  86,952  585  20    12,499  437  13,541  100,493  207,027\nUpgrading  837,803  4,267  3,805    80,374  133,348  221,794  1,059,597  1,994,770\nNew Sites  159,670  411  330    7,351  12,781  20,874  180,544  380,167\n     Total  1,084,425  5,263  4,155    100,224  146,566  256,209  1,340,634  2,581,964\nPoverty Index                0.52\nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "Appendix 15  59 \nE.  Pricing and Affordability to Targeted Beneficiaries \n9.  Overall,  the  proposed  housing  microfinance  to  undertake  home  improvements  or \npurchase a serviced plot and build a starter home were designed to be affordable to the bottom \n35%  of  the  total  urban  households  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  Monthly  amortization \npayments for housing microfinance were calculated at an indicative 16% for 36 months, and \ncompared  against  the  income  and  borrowing  capacity  of  the  beneficiaries  from  a  pilot \nsubproject.  Based  on  these  calculations,  the  proposed  housing  microfinance  will,  on  the \naverage, be affordable at the 20th\u201330th percentiles of the national urban household income \ndistribution, the targeted project beneficiary groups. Land and basic infrastructure services to be \nprovided under the upgraded neighborhood and new sites component will be  financed by \nmatching grants from the central Government and the participating local governments. These \nwill generally not be recovered directly from the beneficiaries but indirectly through taxation.  \n \nF.  Affordability to Participating Local Governments \n \n10.  The financial capability of the local governments, which serve as the implementing \nagencies  for  the  upgraded  neighborhoods  and  new-site  component  of  the  Project,  were \nevaluated (Supplementary Appendix F) based on their financial statements and forecasts of \nfuture  revenues  and  expenditures.  Given  the  financing  requirements  of  the  upgraded \nneighborhoods and new project sites, all the pilot cities will be able to afford the matching grant \nrequirements of the Project. The projected financial statements of 2001\u20132010 suggest further \nthat the pilot cities\u2019 financial performance and standing will improve over the medium term. \n \nG.  Affordability to Participating Financial Institutions \n \n11.  For the shelter microfinance component of the Project, the financial capability of central \nfinancial institutions (CFIs) and local financial institutions (LFIs) potentially eligible to participate \nwere evaluated (Supplementary Appendix F). Financial projections were also conducted to \nascertain their ability to pay the debt-servicing requirements of the subprojects. Representative \nLFIs were assessed. Projections of their financial statements indicate that LFIs will continue to \noperate  profitably  over  the  long  term  and  benefit  from  the  Project.  They  also  more  than \nadequately  meet  the  minimum  standard  requirements  in  six  basic  areas:  (i)  legality,  (ii) \nmanagement capability, (iii) financial solvency, (iv) adherence to asset quality, (v) profitability \nand efficiency, and (vi) liquidity. Given the projected net positive inflows and financial internal \nrates of return from the proposed on-lending subprojects, the LFIs will be more than able to \nmeet the Project\u2019s debt-servicing requirements.  \n \n12.  For  the  CFI  role,  the  financial  capability  of  Bank  Tabungan  Negara  (BTN)  and \nPermodalan Nasional Madani (PNM) were examined. Both have liquidity, profitability, asset \nquality, and capital adequacy ratios that confirm their financial soundness.
