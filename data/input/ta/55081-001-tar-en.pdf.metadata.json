INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will build the capacity of developing \nmember countries (DMCs) to leverage financial markets and instruments to help meet their \nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) commitment to end poverty, fight inequality, and tackle \nclimate change while addressing systemic risk. Fulfillment of the SDGs is threatened by the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The TA will align with the key strategic directions \nunder Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for achieving a prosperous, inclusive, \nresilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific.1 Given the financial sector\u2019s crosscutting role, the \nTA will focus on this sector to help DMCs attain the SDGs.2 Specifically, the TA will support \ndiverse sector and thematic initiatives that mobilize finance; promote knowledge; use innovative \ntechnology; and build strategic partnerships with governments, businesses, and peer international \norganizations to address financing gaps for sustainable development. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 on accelerating \nprogress in gender equality (operational priority 2) and strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity (operational priority 6). The TA was approved and endorsed by the heads of departments \nduring the corporate priority framework meeting in November 2020 and is included in the \n2021 Management-approved results-based  work  plan  of  the  Sustainable  Development  and \nClimate Change Department.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The  financing  needs  for  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  dimensions  of \nsustainable development far outpace public sector resources and private sources of finance, both \ndomestically and internationally. The financial sector, including banking, insurance, and capital \nmarkets, is a key enabler of the real economy. By financing sustainable and resilient infrastructure \nand businesses and mitigating financial risk, it plays a vital role in supporting the shift to a \nsustainable economy that meets current and future needs. However, efforts to mainstream the \nSDGs in the financial sector and respond to the COVID-19 crisis and its economic and social \nimpacts face several challenges. \n \n4.  Dominance of informal finance in the financial lives of the poor. In most DMCs, \naccess to finance is limited to secured payments, savings, credit, insurance, and remittance \nfacilities. Moreover, consumer protection is inadequate, which can undermine trust in financial \nservices providers and the financial sector in general. Without access to formal financial services, \nthe unserved and underserved segments of society, especially women, are excluded from growth \nand its benefits. The poor remain particularly vulnerable given their low awareness of growing \nrisks related to secure transactions and the difficulty they have in effectively voicing grievances. \n \n5.  Paucity  of  enabling  and  proportionate  regulatory  frameworks.  The  legal  and \nregulatory  environment  of  the  financial  sector  in  some  DMCs  is  shallow  and  fragmented.  \nFinancial market infrastructure does not reflect the systemic importance, complexity, and risk \nprofile of regulated entities. A failure to differentiate between smaller firms and systemically \nimportant firms results in a high regulatory burden. The absence of adequate risk-mitigation and \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Operational priority 2: accelerating progress in gender equality; operational priority 6: strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity. ADB. Strategy 2030 Operational Plans. \n2  In this report, \u201cfinancial sector\u201d refers to the general context of the sector while \u201cfinance sector\u201d refers to ADB \noperations. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 June 2021. \n ", "2 \nallocation instruments and techniques complicates access to  debt and equity financing for \ninfrastructure and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).  \n6.  Dominance of public sector and banks in infrastructure investment. Banks dominate \nthe financial system in many DMCs, providing financing that is generally short-term and therefore \nnot well-structured or priced for covering firms\u2019 longer-term financing needs for investment \nprojects. Excessive levels of political risk can endanger commercial viability by diminishing \ninvestors  and  lenders\u2019  willingness  to  provide  equity  and  debt  financing.  \nThe absence of a well-diversified financial sector and an approach to insurance and capital market \ndevelopment that is not sequenced or coordinated amplifies the risks of the banking system. \nGreater use of securitization and capital markets in infrastructure finance will help substitute bank \nlending with long-term financing from nonbank financial institutions, such as pension funds and \ninsurance  companies,  and  help  mobilize  and  channel  domestic  savings  into  productive \ninvestments. Diversified instruments are essential for identifying effective financing approaches, \nand vehicles that can broaden financing options for infrastructure projects and increase and \ndiversify the investor base. This could also lower the cost and increase the availability of financing \nfor infrastructure or regions with financing gaps. \n \n7.  Nonobservance of international financial standards, guidance, and best practices. \nMost DMCs do not fully observe the international financial standards and best practices of the \nrelevant standard-setting bodies. Perceived default risks because of structural impediments, such \nas imperfect information and other market failures, regulatory uncertainty, and weak governance, \ndeter investment by international players. Weak capacity among policy makers and regulators \nalso  discourages  international  investors.  Conversely,  observance  of  international  financial \nstandards and codes and the presence of skilled regulators encourage sound regulation and \nsupervision;  greater  transparency;  and  more  efficient  and  robust  institutions,  markets,  and \ninfrastructure. Standards and codes facilitate better-informed lending and investment decisions, \nimproving market integrity and reducing the risks of financial distress and contagion. \n \n8.   Slow  utilization  of  fintech  innovations.  The  absence  of  fit-for-purpose  financial \nsolutions  for  mass  market  processes  hampers  risk-based  decision-making  and  financial \naccessibility.  Digital  infrastructure  and  tools  for  risk-based  decision-making  are  not  mature \nenough. Widespread adoption of new technologies is slow and expensive, and institutions fail to \nuse efficiency-enhancing technologies or processes because of organizational constraints, slow \nsocial learning, and information friction. Financial inclusion itself could be at risk, driven by \nunequal access to digital infrastructure and potential biases amplified by new data sources and \ndata.  \n \n9.  Lack of access to mobile phones, computers, and/or the internet could lead to new forms \nof exclusion, which could be exacerbated as the shift to digital financial services accelerates \nduring and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Accelerating the growth of digital financial services \ncould also present financial stability risks if regulation and supervision does not recognize \ncybersecurity  risks.  Inappropriate  lending  practices  by  underregulated  institutions  could \njeopardize trust. Policy makers will also need to consider novel approaches to ensure high-quality \nsupervision and regulation, support the safe use of innovative technologies, and ensure that \nregulation remains proportionate to the risks. \n \n10.  The  TA  seeks  to  enable  the  finance  sector  in  recipient  DMCs  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  SDG  agenda  by  using  policy  reforms,  developing  an  enabling  and \nproportionate regulatory environment, and using innovative financing and technology solutions. \nThe assistance will take the form of advisory support for project design and implementation, \n ", "3 \nstrategic collaborations, policy dialogue, capacity development, and development of knowledge \nproducts in one or more of the following areas:  \n(i)  reducing the risks and impediments to investment by creating a more robust \nenabling environment, including through an effective legal, policy, and regulatory \nframework, and responding to other market failures;  \n(ii)  introducing more demanding certification and rating systems to provide a robust \nassessment of risks;  \n(iii)  sharing risks between the public and private sectors by catalyzing and leveraging \nprivate investment through innovative financing approaches;  \n(iv)  promoting  public  financial  management  reforms  and  mobilizing  domestic \nresources by channeling contractual savings into productive investments through \ncapital market instruments;  \n(v)  balancing  regulations  and  policies  with  appropriate  incentives  and  adequate \ninstitutional frameworks and regulatory regimes to ensure financial system stability \nthrough compliance; and  \n(vi)  enhancing access to credit and financial services by reducing costs, managing \nrisks, and using innovative technology to offer new gender-responsive financial \nproducts and services. \n \n11.  The TA will also support the finance sector of recipient DMCs in incentivizing green \ninvestments, scaling up sustainable financing across value chains using innovative derisking \nproducts,  and  introducing  financial  technology  innovations.  Deep,  liquid,  and  well-\nregulated financial systems enhance financial stability while enabling the long-term investments \non  which  societies  depend.  Development  finance  remains  essential  for  closing  the  huge \ninfrastructure gap in Asia and the Pacific (SDG 9) and positively aligning the business practices \nof corporate clients and investee companies with the SDGs (SDG 17). Greater access to formal \nfinancial services (SDGs 1, 10), particularly for women, will enhanced participation in the labor \nmarket. The TA will promote women\u2019s economic empowerment by helping women establish small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SDGs 5, 8) and grow businesses in rural and urban areas.  \n12.  Governments can help spur the linking of finance with innovative technology to raise \nproductivity and incomes and reduce poverty, including by empowering women to benefit from \naccess to secure payment and remittance systems, savings, credit, and insurance. Furthermore, \nDMCs\u2019 demand for support for financial sector strengthening is expected to increase, given the \nneed to meet rapidly changing and complex development challenges in the post-COVID-19 era. \nHigh market volatility and an anticipated deterioration in credit quality stemming from the COVID-\n19 crisis have put many financial systems at risk. The TA will help strengthen institutional \ncapacities  and  create  an  enabling  environment  for  crowding  in  the  private  sector  through \ninnovative measures such as credit guarantee and insurance schemes, banking sector resolution \nprograms, and digital finance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: financial sector investments contributing to \nthe SDGs across both public and private sectors expanded (footnote 1). The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: financial sector support in ADB\u2019s DMCs for the SDG agenda increased.4 It is \n \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nexpected that at least three policy reforms and/or initiatives to support the implementation of the \nSDG agenda will be introduced in at least three DMCs as a result of the TA. \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n14.  Output 1: Project design and implementation supported. Based on demand from \nADB\u2019s operations departments, the TA will support activities that are not normally provided under \ntransaction  TA  for  project  design  from  conception  through  to  transaction  and  project \nimplementation. Projects to be supported include complex and innovative projects that require \ninputs from experts on technical, policy, and institutional aspects. The scope of expert services \nwill  cover  (i)  conducting  diverse  finance  sector  development assessments  for  supporting \ninitiatives to develop well-regulated, deep, and liquid capital and insurance markets; mobilize \ndomestic  savings;  and  enhance  financial stability;  (ii)  initiating  measures  toward  aligning \nregulatory capital initiatives with international standard-setting bodies; (iii) developing innovative \nfinancing approaches by catalyzing and leveraging private investment; (iv) crowding in long-term \nprivate sector investment with appropriate disclosure of risks; (v) supporting MSMEs with a focus \non empowering female entrepreneurs, complemented by adequate stakeholder participation; and \n(vi) promoting financial inclusion by integrating gender and consumer protection considerations \nand imparting financial literacy to enhance the capability to use appropriate financial tools to save \nand borrow money, make and receive payments, manage risks and use new technologies and \ndigital platforms to support market links. \n \n15.  TA  resources  will  also  support  new  and  existing  projects,  including  demonstration \nactivities, by providing experts\u2019 inputs to test and validate innovative products, services, new \ntechnologies, and distribution channels that are ethical, inclusive, resource-efficient, resilient, \nreplicable, and scalable. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Knowledge  management,  strategic  collaborations,  and  capacity \ndevelopment supported. Output 2 will strengthen ADB\u2019s role as a knowledge partner by \nenhancing  knowledge  management  with  DMC  policy  makers  and  stakeholders,  aided  by \nknowledge products in frontier areas of finance and ADB\u2019s tacit operational knowledge gained \nfrom  project  lessons  and  best  practices.  Areas  of  focus  may  include \n (i) improving financial policy alignment   with long-term strategies and plans, and underlying \nsustainable development priorities; (ii) formulating strategies and plans for the post-COVID-19 \nrecovery,  particularly  in  relation  to  MSMEs  and  women,  informed  by  robust  stakeholder \nconsultations; (iii) preparing for potential risks by integrating environmental, social, and corporate \ngovernance  initiatives  into  operations;  and  (iv)  spurring  innovative  approaches,  including \nmainstreaming the use of new and advanced technologies in projects, that prompt the private \nsector to replicate and scale-up successful activities in the DMCs to and increase development \nimpacts. Financing strategies would also include catalyzing new collaborations and increasing \nparticipation  in  existing  partnerships  with  development  finance  institutions  to  help  derisk \ninvestments for institutional investors and crowd in institutional investors with a longer-term \ninvestment  horizon\u2014such  as  insurers  and  pension  funds\u2014for  investing  in  sustainable \ninfrastructure. \n \n17.  Output 2 will also support the Finance Sector Group\u2019s knowledge work, such as ADB\u2019s \nsignature event, the Asia Finance Forum, and the development of print and non-print knowledge \nproducts, including video blogs, web-based materials, and social media. The TA will also support \nthe sharing of expertise, including continuous learning and development activities for DMCs \nthrough strategic collaborations with partners, including potential collaborations with civil society \npartners involved in microfinance for MSMEs, microinsurance, and digital financial services.  \n ", "5 \nThe TA will support capacity building activities to complement projects or TA projects, such as \npeer-to-peer learning and twinning partnerships. To accelerate the implementation of the SDGs, \nthe TA will also support high-level policy dialogues to integrate all levels of governments and \nstakeholders in the elaboration of strategies for the implementation of SDGs. \n \n18.  The TA will support demand-driven requests from ADB\u2019s operations departments where \npriorities are shaped primarily by DMCs\u2019 reform needs. Operational support through the TA will \nhelp address the financial constraints to sustainable development, including building capacity to \nmobilize domestic resources, which remains a major bottleneck in many low-income countries. \nThe TA will sharpen areas of focus for finance sector operations by helping DMCs remove barriers \nto SDG implementation and promoting policies, financial products and services, and innovative \ntechnology aimed at promoting sustainable development. ADB will optimize its impact by aligning \nits  projects  with  DMCs\u2019  national  and  sector  strategies  and  ensuring  the  proportionality  of \nregulations and the appropriateness of policy interventions to promote financial inclusion and \nstability and finance sector reforms to support overall growth and address remaining poverty. \n \n19.  Digital publication is the default approach for disseminating knowledge products. However, \nexternal publications may be printed in limited quantities to share with DMC stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($500,000 from TASF 7 and $1,000,000 from TASF-other \nsources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB will administer the TA. The Finance Sector Group under the Sector Advisory Service \nCluster of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will implement the \nTA and carry out TA administration and supervision, implementation oversight, and communication \nwith consultants and stakeholders in coordination with relevant sector and thematic groups and \noperations departments. Activities organized under the TA will include the organization of and \nparticipation of ADB DMCs in virtual and face-to-face knowledge events such as workshops and \nconferences. ADB staff involved with the TA may participate as resource persons in knowledge \nsharing events, which will include eliciting feedback and suggestions on improving the activities \nimplemented under the TA. Budget will also be allocated for (i) representation and entertainment \nexpenses during knowledge events, and (ii)  the provision of support services by ADB staff (travel \nand  related  costs  for  secretarial  and  administrative  services)  for  TA  implementation  and \nadministration. \n \n22.  Project implementation will use One ADB teams comprising representatives of each \noperations department. Quarterly meetings with project teams will be conducted to monitor the \nstatus of supported projects. \n \n23.
