THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $125 million equivalent in US dollars and yuan\u2014comprising (i) an A-loan of up to \n$62.5 million and (ii) a complementary loan of up to $62.5 million\u2014to Inner Mongolia Saikexing \nBreeding and Biotechnology Group (SKX) for the Sustainable Dairy Farming and Milk Safety \nProject in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Unfinished  agriculture  modernization.  Agriculture  has  developed  rapidly  and  has \nmade substantial contributions to the overall economic development of the PRC. However, the \ntransition to modern agriculture has not kept pace with urbanization and industrialization. The \nper capita income of urban households was 2.75 times that of rural households in 2014. Given \nits fundamental contribution to food security and the improvement of rural livelihood, agricultural \nmodernization continues to be highly prioritized by the Government of the PRC, particularly by \nencouraging stronger participation of private sector companies.1 \n \n3.  Insufficient domestic milk production. The gap between domestic production and \nconsumption of processed milk is forecast to grow from 9.7 million tons in 2014 to 15.4 million \ntons in 2024. However, the PRC cannot rely on imported milk powder to meet the increasing \ndemand, not only because of impacts on national food security, but also because fresh milk has \na higher nutritional value than milk reconstituted from milk powder. As a result, investing in the \ndairy farming sector is needed to increase the production of high-quality raw milk. \n \n4.  Food safety issues. The PRC\u2019s milk industry has faced serious food safety issues, \nmost notably the melamine incident in 2008.2 Since then, the central government has made \nsignificant strides in food safety management. The Food Safety Law (2009, amended in 2015) \nstipulates  that  (i)  local  governments  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  supervision  and \nmanagement  of  food  safety  in  their  jurisdiction;  and  (ii)  food  producers  and  traders  are \nresponsible for strict compliance with the law, relevant regulations, and food safety standards.3 \n \n5.  Environmental issues. If not properly managed, the development of the dairy sector \ncould harm the environment. Dairy farms produce waste with a high concentration of pollutants; \nthe waste is often discharged without proper treatment, seriously polluting land and water, and \ncausing significant greenhouse gas emissions. The government has promoted policies that \nmandate waste treatment but most farms still do not have proper waste treatment facilities \n(footnote 3). \n \n6.  Large-scale dairy farm development. To meet the growing demand for quality milk \nproduced locally, the PRC government continues to support the construction of large-scale, \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nmodern, and standardized dairy farms.4 Large dairy farms with more than 100 cows have a \ncompetitive advantage over small dairy farms. They are more cost-efficient thanks to economies \nof scale. They are also more able to invest in quality inputs and management systems. Large \ndairy processors, such as the Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group and the Inner Mongolia \nMengniu Dairy Group, tend to source raw milk from modern, large-scale farms that can meet \ntheir quality standards and also mitigate the risk of food safety incidents. However, large-scale \ndairy farming needs to be more environmentally sustainable. \n \n7.  Borrower\u2019s selection. SKX is the fourth-largest dairy farming company in the PRC in \nterms of herd size, with 90,000 cows as of December 2015.5 After appraising the industry\u2019s \nlargest companies, the project team identified SKX as the most suitable for Asian Development \nBank (ADB) support because of its (i) strategic focus on dairy farming (no dairy processing \noperations) and continuous efforts to improve dairy farm management practices; (ii) research \nand development operations and scientific approach to dairy cow breeding based on the most \nadvanced  frozen  semen  technologies;  and  (iii)  highly  experienced  and  well-respected \nmanagement team led by Yang Wenjun, who was the chief executive officer of Mengniu (the \nsecond-largest dairy processing company in the PRC, after Yili) during 2006\u20132012. SKX is \ncommitted to adopting international best practices in terms of environmental and food safety \nmanagement, and to setting a benchmark for the industry. \n \n2.  Project Design \n8.  The project will support SKX\u2019s $160 million investment plan during 2017\u20132018, including \ncapital expenditure (capex) on the environment, food safety, and modern dairy farm expansion. \n \n9.  Environmental capital expenditure. The project aims to manage the environmental \nissues associated with animal waste by supporting SKX\u2019s best-in-class environmental capex in \nits 27 farms (as of December 2015) and its new farms (four farms to be developed during 2017\u2013\n2018). The project will include the construction of (i) solid\u2013liquid separation facilities, (ii) best-in-\nclass manure storage to prevent contamination of surface and groundwater, (iii) organic fertilizer \nprocessing facilities, (iv) biogas digesters, (v) multilevel oxidation lagoons, and (vi) wastewater \ntreatment facilities. After undergoing solid\u2013liquid separation, solid waste is used as cow bed \npadding and for organic fertilizer production. Some recycled liquid waste is used for washing the \nfloors of cow houses and milking parlors. In at least five farms, SKX will install biogas digesters \nto capture the methane contained in the slurry for use in heating and cooking, or for generating \nelectricity. In all farms, the liquid waste will eventually end up in multilevel oxidation lagoons, \nwhere sediments are dredged out regularly and used for organic fertilizer production. The \nwastewater from the lagoons undergoes further treatment before being recycled for irrigation. \nSKX still needs to dilute wastewater with freshwater to meet national standards for irrigation \nwater, but this will no longer be required once the wastewater treatment facilities are upgraded. \nThe proposed capex will help SKX comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nrequirements  and  with  the  International  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  Environmental,  Health,  and \nSafety Guidelines for Mammalian Livestock Production.6 \n \n                                                \n4  Central  Committee  of  the  Communist  Party  of  China  and  Government  of  the  PRC.  2015.  Resolutions on \nAccelerating Agricultural Modernization by Enhancing Revolution and Innovation. Beijing. \n5  As of 2015, China Modern Dairy had 225,000 cows, Liaoning Huishan Dairy Group had 180,000 cows, and Inner \nMongolia Shengmu High-Tech Animal Husbandry had 106,000 cows. \n6  International Finance Corporation. 2007.

The project will support SKX\u2019s efforts to comply \nwith  national  and  international  food  safety  and  quality  standards.  The  project  will  include \ninvestments  in  (i)  healthy  feed-processing  equipment,  (ii)  animal  health  equipment,  and \n(iii) sterilized milking equipment. High-quality feed is a key element contributing to milk safety. \nFeeding dairy cows with high-quality feed improves their health, reduces the risk of disease and \nusage of medicine (especially antibiotics), and increases the quality of  the milk produced. \nInvesting in sterilized milking equipment is also critical, since the milking process is where the \nrisk of bacterial contamination is the highest. The project will ensure that existing and new farms \nachieve best-in-class certifications, including the national good agricultural practices and the \ninternationally recognized hazard analysis and critical control point certification. \n \n11.  Capital expenditure on modern dairy farm expansion. SKX plans to develop at least \nfour new modern dairy farms with about 5,000 cows each during 2017\u20132018. The new farms will \nbe in the rural areas of the northern provinces and autonomous regions of Hebei, Heilongjiang, \nHenan, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, and Shanxi, where the supply of forage crops such as corn \nsilage and alfalfa is good. Young cows for the new farms will most likely be transferred from \nexisting farms. Since cows are not milkable until they reach the age of 24 months, the cost of \nfeeding young cows is included in the dairy farm expansion capex. The project will also include \ninvestments in barns, milking parlors, other buildings, and infrastructure. \n \n3.  The Sponsor \n12.  SKX has 21 farms in Inner Mongolia, three in Hebei, and one each in Henan, Ningxia \nHu, and Shandong. Founded by Mengniu in 2006 as a dairy cow breeding company, SKX\u2019s \nmain business was in frozen semen. In 2012, Yang Wenjun led a management buyout and took \ncontrol of the company. SKX has since expanded into the dairy farm business. Through organic \ngrowth and acquisitions of smaller dairy companies and individual farms, SKX has grown to \nbecome the fourth-largest dairy company in the PRC. As of 2015, SKX recorded total revenue \nof $167 million; earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization of $59 million; and \nnet profit of $25 million. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n13.  The project will promote modern dairy farming with better environmental sustainability \nand  product  safety.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  2015  strategic  orientations  for  the \nagriculture sector provided by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the \nPRC government as a contribution to the country\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020), \nwhich set policy objectives for the sector, including (i) enhancing environmental protection and \nwaste treatment in agricultural production; (ii) improving the quality of agricultural products and \nthe  level  of  food  safety;  and  (iii)  optimizing  the  \u201cstructure\u201d  of  the  agricultural  industry  by \nsupporting production in certain sectors, such as the livestock sector (footnote 4). \n \n2.  Outcome \n14.  The outcome of the project will be the demonstration of modern dairy farming with \nstronger environmental sustainability and milk safety. Detailed indicators on waste treatment \nand milk safety are listed in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. The project will \ncontribute to climate change mitigation by capturing methane in biogas digesters (66,000 tons of \ncarbon dioxide avoided every  year from 2020), but also more generally through improved \n ", "4 \nanimal productivity and better feed management arising from modern dairy farming investments \nand practices. The project will also support job creation and job preservation in rural areas. \nSKX\u2019s farms are located in the rural areas of some of the PRC\u2019s poorest provinces, such as \nShanxi (24th out of 31 provinces and autonomous regions in terms of gross domestic product \nper capita), Henan (22nd), Heilongjiang (20th) Hebei (18th), and Ningxia Hu (15th). SKX\u2019s \nworkforce is expected to increase from 2,000 in 2015 (of whom 31% are women) to more than \n2,600 in 2020 (of whom 35% are women). As of 2015, SKX\u2019s employees were 21% Mongolian, \n6% Hui, 1% Man, and 3% other minorities. The number of smallholder farmers supplying forage \nto SKX is also expected to increase from about 15,000 in 2015 to at least 17,500 by 2020. \n \n3.  Outputs \n15.   The outputs of the project will be the successful implementation of (i) an environmental \ncapex plan, (ii) a food safety capex plan, and (iii) a modern dairy farm expansion plan. Detailed \nindicators are listed in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n16.  The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes \nthe need to support food security and agricultural productivity and to promote food safety and \nquality standards.7 The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u2013\n2020 for the PRC. To support rural development for inclusive economic growth, ADB will assist \nthe  PRC  in  developing  suitable  methods  to  (i)  modernize  agriculture;  (ii)  promote  circular \nagriculture through the value chain to reduce resource inputs and waste outputs, and control \npollution; and (iii) improve food safety, including related infrastructure and capacity development. \nThrough its private sector operations, ADB will support agribusiness projects that enhance \nproductivity, inclusion of smallholder farmers in value chains, and food safety (footnote1). \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n17.  The project is also fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural \nResources, which recommends greater private sector agribusiness  investments by ADB to \n\u201ccontribute to public goods, such as food security, food safety, and reduced soil and water \npollution, thus  benefiting the  wider  [developing member  country]  populations.\u201d8 The  project \nbuilds on lessons learned from ADB\u2019s long history in the PRC livestock sector, particularly the \nneed to achieve development impact through private sector agro-enterprises with sufficient \nscale.9 It will complement a PRC sovereign project approved in 2015, which will support similar \nenvironmental and food safety investments by medium-sized livestock companies (footnote 3), \nwhile ADB\u2019s proposed nonsovereign assistance targets a larger company, SKX. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Implementation Arrangements \n20.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \n   \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  SKX is subject to the general laws regulating private sector enterprises in the PRC and as they \nframework  relate to large-scale dairy farming. In particular, SKX is subject to the Environmental Protection \nLaw (2015), the Environmental Impact Assessment Law (2003), and the Food Safety Law (2009, \namended in 2015). \nManagement  SKX is led by a management team with a long experience in the dairy breeding, farming, and \nprocessing industry. Yang Wenjun, SKX\u2019s chairman, is the former CEO of Mengniu. Under his \nleadership (2006\u20132012), Mengniu became the PRC\u2019s second-largest dairy processing company. \nHis management skills and rich experience are key factors in driving SKX\u2019s success.  \nImplementation  SKX plans to develop and build at least four new farms during 2017\u20132018. Each new farm will be \nperiod  designed to accommodate up to 5,000 heads. It will take about 12 months to complete a farm. \nConstruction  The new farms will be located in areas where the supply of forage crops and water is good. \narrangements   Young cows will most likely be transferred from existing herds. Procurement of equipment and \ncivil works will be carried out in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time) as they apply to private sector projects. ADB\u2019s technical consultant has reviewed \nand validated the cost of the new farms and found them to be in line with market standards. \nOperations  Raw milk is sold under long-term contracts with large dairy processors, similar to the contracts in \narrangements  place for existing farms. SKX will manage its dairy farm operations according to the best industry \nstandards, including ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements, and will adopt GAP \nand HACCP food safety certifications. \nPerformance  SKX will report on key performance indicators, including financial, safeguard, gender, and \nmonitoring  development indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets), on at least an annual basis. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEO = chief executive officer, GAP = good agricultural practices, HACCP = hazard \nanalysis and critical control point, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, SKX = Inner Mongolia Saikexing Breeding and \nBiotechnology Group. \nSources: Inner Mongolia Saikexing Breeding and Biotechnology Group; and Asian Development Bank. \n \nF.  Unique Features \n21.  The project is ADB\u2019s first direct nonsovereign assistance to a livestock company and \nADB\u2019s first private sector agribusiness project with a specific focus on environmental protection \nand food safety, which are among the PRC\u2019s top priorities for the sector. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n22.  ADB  proposes  to  provide  a  loan  facility  of  up  to  $125  million  equivalent  to  SKX, \nconsisting  of  an  A-loan  of  up  to  $62.5  million  equivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan  and  a \ncomplementary loan of up to $62.5 million equivalent in US dollars and yuan. ADB will fund the \nA-loan from its ordinary capital resources, and the complementary loan will be funded by the \nPRC banks or international commercial banks with local branches in the PRC, with ADB acting \nas the lender of record. SKX will use the loan proceeds to finance those of its subsidiaries that \nwill be implementing different components of the project. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  ADB assistance will add value on several fronts: \n(i)  Demonstration effect. ADB will help SKX set environmental and food safety \nbenchmarks for the PRC\u2019s dairy farming industry. This will encourage other large \nand medium-scale dairy farming companies to follow this model. \n(ii)  Long-term financing. Environmental and food safety capex have a payback \nperiod that is hard to quantify, since they do not directly contribute to increased \n ", "7 \nrevenue  but  rather  help  mitigate  risks  and  contribute  to  positive.  Long-term \nfinancing is required to encourage private sector to make these investments. \n(iii)  Multiple projects at once. Through a single corporate loan, ADB can finance up \nto 31 farms in seven provinces and autonomous regions, ensuring a wide impact. \n(iv)  Cofinancing mobilization. Domestic and international commercial banks will be \nencouraged to provide long-term financing to SKX through complementary loans. \n(v)  Lessons  learned  for  future  projects.  Governments  and  private  sector \ncompanies from other developing member countries can learn from this project to \npromote sustainable dairy farming and milk safety in their country. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n24.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \nSince the proposed ADB assistance is a corporate loan that is not earmarked for financing \nspecific subprojects but will finance certain types of capex across all existing and new farms, the \nrequirements for general corporate finance projects will apply. The potential environmental and \nsocial impacts of the project have been identified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, \nmitigate, and compensate for adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and \nplans. Siting of the dairy farms is done in coordination with the local government to ensure that it \nconforms with local land use plans and avoids legally protected areas. Potential risks and \nimpacts  during  construction  are mostly  site-specific  and  short-term,  and  can  be  effectively \nmanaged by good engineering construction and housekeeping practices implemented through a \nconstruction environmental management plan. During operation, the new waste management \nfacilities will contribute to address concerns on solid waste and wastewater disposal, which has \nthe potential for surface and groundwater pollution. Since the farms will be located away from \ninhabited areas, nuisance, noise, and odor impacts will be mitigated. \n \n25.  No involuntary resettlement impacts are envisaged because SKX will avoid forest and \nbasic farmland and will lease state-owned land or unused and wasteland from land owners and \nvillages on a willing-lessor\u2013willing-lessee basis. Future expansion activities are expected to be \ncarried out in the northern part of the PRC, which has sufficient land resources. In unavoidable \ncases where basic farmland will be used, village collectives typically provide replacement land \nto these villagers to minimize impacts on their livelihoods. Impacts on indigenous peoples are \nunlikely, and SKX\u2019s operations are not expected to have impacts on identity, culture, and natural \nresource-based livelihoods. In ethnic minority autonomous regions where SKX operates, SKX \nwill avoid leasing land used by ethnic minority groups. The company will offer jobs to willing and \nqualified workers, including those from ethnic minorities, who will benefit from the additional \nincome and new livestock breeding skills and information. \n \n26.  SKX engaged a qualified and experienced external expert to conduct a corporate audit \non the company\u2019s existing environmental and social policy, procedures, and operations.
