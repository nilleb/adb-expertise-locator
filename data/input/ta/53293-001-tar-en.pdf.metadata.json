INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will assist the Government of Sri \nLanka\u2019s efforts to build a resilient and competitive tourism industry. The TA team will work in close \ncollaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and Aviation (Ministry of Tourism); the Sri Lanka Institute \nof Tourism and Hotel Management (Institute of Tourism); and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development \nAuthority to train homestay operators, raise awareness and provide training, and update the \ntourism institute\u2019s curricula. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Sri Lanka.1 The TA is in response to the government\u2019s request to \nsupport tourism, which was severely affected by the terror attacks on 21 April 2019.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Tourism a key contributor to Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. In 2018, earnings from tourism \nwere $4.4 billion (or 4.9% of gross domestic product), representing average annual growth of \n28.9% from $575.9 million in 2010.3 Tourist arrivals increased from 0.6 million in 2010 to \n2.3 million in 2018. Tourism was the country\u2019s third-largest foreign exchange earner behind \nremittances ($7.0 billion) and garment exports ($5.3 billion) in 2018. In 2017, Sri Lanka received \n11% of tourist arrivals in South Asia, the second highest rate behind India.4 Direct jobs generated \nin the industry increased from 55,000 in 2010 to 169,003 in 2018 (or 2.1% of the country\u2019s total \nemployment in 2018). Tourism supported 388,487 direct and indirect jobs in 2018, or 4.8% of total \nemployment. The large number of indirect jobs is an indicator of the multiplier effect of this growing \nindustry. \n \n4.  Tourism potential. Tourism has been one of the pillars of Sri Lanka\u2019s growth since the \nend of the long civil conflict in 2009. The country offers a diverse range of tourism experiences in \na compact size, allowing tourists to enjoy multiple aspects of it. It has won several international \nendorsements as a travel destination.5 The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that the \ndirect jobs in Sri Lanka\u2019s travel and tourism industry are expected to be 522,000 by 2028, and \ntotal employment is expected to exceed 1 million jobs by 2028.6 \n \n5.  Easter Sunday attacks. On 21 April 2019, Sri Lanka was hit by coordinated attacks that \nkilled 253 people, including 37 foreigners, and injured at least 500.7 The industry felt their \nimmediate impact: tourist arrivals during the second quarter (Q2) of 2019 were 41.4% lower than \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

The council \nclassifies direct jobs as employment by hotels, travel agents, airlines, and other passenger transportation services \n(excluding commuter services), as well as jobs in the restaurant and leisure industries directly supported by tourists. \nIndirect jobs are generated through wider effects from travel and tourism investment spending, government collective \nspending that aids travel and tourism activity, and domestic purchases of goods and services by the industry \nsegments dealing directly with tourists. The induced contribution to employment measures the jobs supported by the \nspending of those who are directly and indirectly employed by the travel and tourism industry. \n7  The Government Official News Portal. 2019.

Month-on-month arrivals, \nhowever, show a pickup. \n \n6.  Support for tourism after the attacks. The government announced a financial relief \npackage to support the tourism businesses with immediate cash flow needs.8 To attract tourists \nback, the government also launched promotional campaigns to present Sri Lanka as a safe \ndestination, and several more are planned. Immediately after the incidents, some of the leading \nprivate  tourism  players  launched  the  Sri  Lanka  Tourism  Alliance.9  The  TA  builds  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s recovery efforts to help create a resilient tourism industry in the context of the \ngovernment\u2019s sector development strategy. \n \n7.  Consultations with various stakeholders emphasized the need to not only focus on \nrecovery but also build a resilient and competitive tourism industry. Sri Lanka is the only country \nin South Asia that showed a decline in tourism competitiveness\u2014its ranking fell from 64th in 2017 \nto 77th in 2019, as measured by the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index.10 \n \n8.  Sector development strategy. The government\u2019s medium-term development strategy, \nVision 2025, highlights tourism\u2019s importance in helping Sri Lanka become a rich country.11 To \nfurther the Vision 2025 objectives, the government adopted the Tourism Strategic Plan (TSP), \n2017\u20132020, which envisions Sri Lanka to be the world\u2019s finest island for memorable, authentic, \nand diverse experiences.12 The TSP identifies weak coordination, institutional deficiencies, lack \nof resources, and market failures as constraints to Sri Lanka becoming a high value-added \ndestination and providing economic benefits to communities. To remedy this, the TSP proposes \nsix core actions: (i) improving governance and regulation, (ii) understanding visitors, (iii) marketing \nand  communicating  effectively,  (iv)  developing  sustainable  destinations,  (v)  lifting  industry \nstandards, and (vi) engaging the workforce and communities. \n \n9.  Spreading tourism\u2019s benefits. To empower rural communities, distribute the benefits of \ntourism  growth,  supplement  available  accommodation,  and  broaden  the  base  of  tourism \nstakeholders, the government launched a homestay program in 2011.13 The program offers an \nalternative experience and allows tourists to gain first-hand insights into the local culture and \nlifestyle. The Tourism Development Authority registered 503 homestay units with 1,520 rooms, \nbut many operate informally and their managers lack training. It is essential that those offering \nhomestays meet a certain standard in terms of facilities, services, security, and reliability. The \ntourism authority provides guidelines and training for homestay operators that cover these \ndifferent criteria. However, training efforts have not kept pace with growth in the number of \nhomestay operators. The geographic dispersion of homestay units and the choice of Colombo as \na venue for training has made it difficult to reach out to most homestay operators. Travelers \n \n8  This included (i) a 1-year moratorium on loans by tourism businesses, (ii) a 1-year moratorium on loans by tourism \nemployees, (iii) duty-free import of security equipment for hotels, (iv) working capital loans for tourism businesses of \nup to SLRs250 million at a preferential interest rate of 3.4% to be repaid within 2 years, (v) a lower value-added tax \nfor tourism businesses (7% instead of 15%), and (vi) interest-free Sancharaka Podda loans up to SLRs500,000 with \na 1-year moratorium from the Regional Development Bank to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the \nindustry. \n9  Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance (accessed on 28 August 2019). \n10 World Economic Forum. 2019.

Homestay operators will benefit from \nthe marketing of their facilities on social media platforms and from learning how to handle \nfeedback or queries through social media or booking websites. \n \n10.  Developing a competitive workforce in tourism. The Private Sector Tourism Skills \nCommittee estimates an additional demand for 25,000\u201330,000 workers per year to meet the \nexpected increase in tourist arrivals, but the government and private training institutes only \nproduce 10,000 graduates annually.14 The committee calls for concerted efforts to build a strong \nand competitive workforce\u2014developing skills to meet industry needs, improving the quality of \ntraining, and raising awareness of parents and communities about job opportunities and working \nconditions in the tourism industry\u2014while also engaging local communities. Although low female \nlabor force participation is a countrywide challenge, the share of women among those employed \nin tourism is estimated at less than 10% because of social and cultural issues; negative industry \nperceptions; multiple roles that women are expected to fulfill, including household and family \nresponsibilities; and inflexible work hours. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: industry standards improved, and workforce \nand communities engaged (footnote 12). The TA will have the following outcome: awareness, \nwillingness, and capacity of communities and the workforce to engage in tourism enhanced.15 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Homestay operators trained on quality of service and their marketing \nskills strengthened. Through training programs, hands-on guidance, and knowledge sharing, \nthe TA will provide homestay operators with coaching to improve service provision in terms of \ncustomer care, security, and reliability and also support them in marketing their units. Industry \nexperts, in consultation with the tourism authority, will develop standards for homestay units that \nthe coaches will apply during site visits. The homestay operators will receive training on setting \nup social media profiles, managing content, and managing and responding to customer feedback. \nBefore on-site coaching starts, all trainers will participate in a train-the-trainer program with \nindustry experts. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Awareness  and  knowledge  on  tourism  among  women  and  youth \nincreased. The TA will raise awareness about tourism opportunities among women and youth by \ntargeting students, parents, and teachers. The TA will also support a program that exposes young \npeople to practical training in specific fields and provides entry-level readiness to join the industry. \n \n14.  Output 3: Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management curricula updated. \nTo overcome the skills gap in tourism and make tourism education more attractive by offering a \npathway to a degree program, experts engaged under the TA will define the requirements and \nupgrade the curricula that will allow the Institute of Tourism to offer a joint degree with the \n \n14 Private Sector Tourism Skills Committee. 2018.
