The 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP) of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) will be \nprepared in 2005 and early 2006.1 The 11FYP will  be crucial  for designing strategies and \nprograms for socioeconomic development in 2006\u20132010. As stated in the Country Strategy and \nProgram Update (CSPU) 2005\u20132007 for the PRC, supporting the preparation of 11FYP is one \nof the priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) operation in the PRC. During the 2005 \nCountry  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  requested  that  ADB  provide  technical \nassistance (TA) to support the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to study \nstrategies for foreign loans utilization and regional cooperation in the Asia and Pacific region, \nincluding subregional cooperation in Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) 2 and  Central  Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), 3 areas for the 11FYP.  The fact-finding meetings \nwere  conducted  with  NDRC  in  March\u2013May 2005 to  determine  NDRC\u2019s actual needs and \nreached  understanding  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference.4 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.   \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n2.  In the past 25 years, using foreign loans has helped PRC\u2019s economic developmentb y \nfilling  fiscal  and  foreign  reserve  gaps  and  improving  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  for \ntransportation, energy, and environmental protection.  It has also helped social development \nincluding education and health, poverty reduction, and rural development.  Foreign loans have \nbecome an important channel  for introducing advanced technologies and management skills \nfrom abroad.  \n \n3.  However, some fundamental changes have taken place since the late 1990s. Due to the \nrapid increase in foreign direct investment and  improvement of  fiscal management, foreign \nexchange reserves surged and fiscal revenue increased more than 18% annually on average in \nthe past  10 years. Infrastructure bottlenecks have also been reduced as the Government \ninvested heavily in infrastructure in the past 10 years or more.  \n \n4.  PRC\u2019s long-term development goal is to quadruple the 2000 gross domestic product and \nachieve a xiaokang (all-around prosperous) society by 2020. To achieve this overall goal, the \nGovernment adopted new development strategies that emphasize balanced development and a \nharmonized society. Accordingly, priorities for using foreign loans, particularly those mobilized \nthrough sovereign borrowing, should be adjusted. During the meeting between PRC President \nHu Jingtao and ADB President Kuroda in April 2005, President Hu emphasized that ADB should \nexpand the scope of its lending assistance from infrastructure construction to agriculture, public \nhealth, education, and environmental protection. He also suggested that ADB enhance its role \nin regional and subregional cooperation.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Starting from 1953, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China developed 5-year plans (FYPs) for \nsocioeconomic development every 5 years. Except for 1963\u20131965, the Government had formulated 10 FYPs by \n2004.  \n2  Greater Mekong Subregion member countries include Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, \nThailand, Viet Nam, and PRC (Yunnan province and newly joined Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region). \n3  Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) member countries include Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and PRC (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region). \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 5 February 2005. ", "2   \n5.  Under such changes of environment, some new issues on foreign loans utilization have \nemerged.  For  example,  (i)  what  would  be  the  appropriate  volume  of  continued  external \nborrowing in view of the huge foreign exchange reserves, (ii) what would be the role of \nsovereign borrowing in the thrust to realize more balanced economic growth and a harmonized \nsociety, (iii) what would be the potential for subsovereign and nonsovereign borrowing, (iv) what \nwould be the optimal mixture of sovereign and subsovereign/nonsovereign borrowings, and (v) \nwhat would be the most appropriate management tools for external debt management that can \nguide the sectoral/geographic allocation of borrowed resources. This TA will investigate those \nissues and formulate strategies, policies, and measures on utilization of foreign loans in the \ncoming 11FYP period.  \n \n6.  With  PRC\u2019s  incraesing  integration  into  the  world  and  Asian  economies,  regional \ncooperation has become more and more important for the country. The Asian financial crisis \nand the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) underscore the importance of \nregional  cooperation  so  that  countries  can  jointly  meet  common  challenges  and  prosper \ntogether.  The PRC is actively participating in many regional cooperation arrangements in the \nAsia  and  Pacific  region  including  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  Forum, \nASEAN+3 (PRC, Japan, and Republic of Korea), and Boao Forum. As the most populous \ncountry in the world, the PRC should play a more proactive role in regional cooperation in the \nnext 5-10 years.  \n \n7.  At the subregional level, the PRC is actively participating in ADB\u2019s initiativesi ncluding \nGMS, CAREC, and the PRC-Mongolia Subregion (Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region). The \nGovernment is striving to improve cross-border trade, transport, and resources protection to \nreduce poverty in those areas where many of the poor live. Although substantial progress has \nbeen made, subregional cooperation faces new challenges in the coming 5-10 years.  For \ninstance,  PRC\u2019s  participation  in  subregional  cooperation  has  focused  on  the  piecemeal \nexpansions of local economies promoted by bordering provinces. It is necessary to strengthen \ncoordination at the central level and integration with the national development program. \n \n8.  To identify difficulties and promote regional/subregional cooperation, the TA will review \nexperiences, identify major issues, and formulate guidelines, main goals, and PRC\u2019s strategies \nin regional/subregional cooperation during the 11FYP period.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is to develop strategies and plans on foreign loans utilization and  regional \ncooperation in the Asia and Pacific region, including subregional cooperation in GMS and \nCAREC areas during the 11FYP period. Well-designed strategies and plans for efficient use of \nforeign loans and wider involvement in regional and subregional cooperation will contribute to \nmaintain more sustainable growth and build a more harmonized society in the long term.  \n \n10.  Key  findings  and  recommendations  will  be  provided  to  relevant  ministries  for \nconsideration during the annual National People\u2019s Congress N(PC) meeting in March 2006 \nwhen  the  11FYP  will  be  deliberated.  In  addition,  the  TA  study  reports  will  be  further \ndisseminated through policy workshops, seminars, and publications.  \n \n \n ", "       3 \n \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be carried out in three parts that correspond to three strategic topics. They \nare (i) past performance and future strategies for foreign loan utilization; (ii) overall scope and \nstrategic  approaches  for  more  proactive  engagement  in  regional  cooperation;  and  (iii) \nopportunities  and  further  measures  for  more  active  participation  in  GMS  and  CAREC \nsubregional  programs.  In  carrying  out  the  three  studies,  the  TA  will  follow  a  general \nmethodology, that first critically reviews past experience, assess impacts and ascertain lessons; \nthen identify future strategic options and policy choices; and finally, develop actionable plans for \nimplementation during the 11FYP period.  \n \n12.  The  TA  will  combine  international  experiences  with  domestic  practice  in  all  three \ncomponents by presenting strategies applied and policies and successful experiences in other \ncountries, especially similar developing countries. ADB will work with the executing agency to \nidentify international experts and top domestic experts who are working or researching in \nrelevant areas.  As distinguished resource persons for international workshops, international \nexperts will focus on presenting experience and practices in their countries or organizations. As \nwell-selected individual consultants, domestic experts will undertake in-depth studies to develop \nthe three strategies by integrating international experiences and local practices.  \n \n13.  Key  activities  for  the  three  strategic  studies  will  have  four  logical  components:  (i) \npresentation  of  international  experience  and  consultation;  (ii)  assessment,  analysis,  and \nforecast; (iii) consultation with policy makers, think tanks, academia, private sector, and civil \nsociety; and (iv) dissemination of findings. In component (i), three international workshops will \nbe  held  to  present  the  international  experts\u2019  findings  on  foreign  loans  utilization,  regional \ncooperation, and subregional cooperation. Several face-to-face consulting meetings between \ninternational experts, domestic experts, and NDRC staff will follow. In component (ii), domestic \nexperts will undertake detailed studies by collecting data, incorporating international experts\u2019 \nfindings, and conducting econometric analysis and case studies to complete the first draft \nreports. In component (iii), several consulting meetings/seminars will be held to discuss the \npreliminary findings and to get feedback from  policy makers, think tanks, academia, private \nsector, and civil society. On the basis of  these discussions and consultation, the domestic \nexperts  will  revise  their  reports.  The  final  reports  will  be  provided  to  policy  makers  for \nincorporation in the 11FYP and dissemination through conferences, publications, and media.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $630,000  equivalent,  comprising  $150,000  in  foreign \nexchange and $480,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $500,000 equivalent on a \ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA program to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$350,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance of the \nlocal currency cost, equivalent to $130,000, by providing counterpart staff, workshop facilities, \nand logistical support. Appendix 2 gives the cost estimates and the financing plan.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  NDRC\u2019s Foreign Capital Utilization Departmnet (FCUD), with the broad mandate for \nplanning in foreign capital utilization and regional/subregional cooperation, will be the Executing \nAgency for the TA. FCUD will ensure close coordination with central Government ministries, \nlocal government agencies,  and research institutions. It will monitor TA implementation and \nreview  study  findings.  A  project  implementation  team  comprising  FCUD\u2019s  deputy  director ", "4   \ngeneral, division chiefs, and project officers will be responsible for the TA\u2019s daily operations. \nFCUD will provide office facilities and access to all relevant information and data.   \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, beginning in  August 2005 and ending in \nAugust  2006.    ADB  will  engage  international  experts  as  resource  persons  and  domestic \nconsultants as individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nThe  international  experts,  with  expertise  in  practices  in  foreign  capital  utilization  and \nregional/subregional cooperation, will prepare papers, present them in international workshops, \nand provide  consultation. The domestic experts (40 person-months) will have expertise in \ninstitutional lending, commercial lending, foreign capital utilization strategy, regional cooperation \nin the Asia and Pacific region, and subregional cooperation in GMS and CAREC areas.  \n \n17.  The consultants will work in three subgroups, each led by a team leader. Considering \nthe large group of consultants and the lack of familiarity of most domestic consultants with ADB \nprocedures, two administrative assistants will be recruited to deal with administrative issues, \nincluding  coordinating  with  international  and  domestic  consultants,  organizing  workshops, \npreparing documents for disbursement, and interpreting and translating. NDRC will provide \noffice accommodation for them. Appendix 3 gives the terms of reference for consultants. \n \n18.  Three international workshops will be organized to introduce international experience 2 \nmonths after inception meetings. Related consulting meetings will follow. Each international \nconsultant will submit a paper  before the workshops. Domestic consultants will submit  their \ninterim reports by the end of the 4 months. The interim reports will analyze all components of \nthe TA and give recommendations. The consultants will submit their draft final reports within 8 \nmonths. The team leaders will submit their final reports, incorporating comments from the \nGovernment, ADB, and other stakeholders, within 1 month  after receiving such comments. \nFCUD will publish the final report. \n \n19.  Equipment  for  consultants  in  carrying  out  the  TA  will  be  procured  under  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  The  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  to  and  liquidated  by  FCUD \naccording to procedures and requirements of ADB\u2019s advance payment facility .\n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Support for the Preparation of the 11th \nFive-Year Plan, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "   Appendix 1    5              \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance   Data Sources and  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       \nMore effective foreign  \u2022 More balanced and  \u2022 Monitoring by Asian  Assumption \nloans utilization and  equitable social-economic  Development Bank  The Government \nbetter coordinated  development  (ADB)  maintains its reform and \nregional/subregional  \u2022 Wider regional/subregional  \u2022 Government reports  opening-up policies. \ncooperation in achieving  collaboration in key areas  \u2022 ADB review missions   \nbalanced and equitable  such as cross-border trade   \ndevelopment in the 11th  and environment protection \nFive-Year Plan (FYP)   \nperiod  \n \nOutcome       \nStrategies and plans for  \u2022 Inclusion of key  \u2022 Official document of the  Assumption \nforeign loans utilization  recommendations of the  11FYP   \u2022  Foreign loans \nand regional/subregional  technical assistance (TA)  \u2022 Monitoring by the  utilization and \ncooperation during the  report in the Government\u2019s  People\u2019s Republic of  regional cooperation \n11FYP period formulated  11FYP   China Resident Mission  are priorities of the \n  (PRCM)  Government\u2019s 11FYP .\n\u2022 Government reports   \nRisk \n\u2022  Recommendations in \nthe TA are not in \naccord with the \nGovernment\u2019s \npriorities. \n \nOutputs       \nPart 1: Impact  \u2022 Framework agreed upon  \u2022 ADB and National  Assumption \nassessment and policy  by end-August 2005  Development and  \u2022  Consensus emerges \nrecommendations on  \u2022 International consultants\u2019  Reform Committee  on the \nforeign capital utilization  papers/presentations  (NDRC) screening of  recommendations, \nduring the 11FYP period  submitted by end- drafts, with review and  supported by various \n  September 2005  discussion through  Government agencies \n  \u2022 Domestic consultants\u2019  meetings or workshops  and provincial \n  interim reports finalized by  \u2022 Consultants\u2019  progress  governments. \n  end-February 2006   reports   \u2022  TA is implemented \n  \u2022 Final report finalized in  \u2022 Review of draft reports  timely. \n  mid-July 2006   \n     \nPart 2: Impact  \u2022 Framework agreed upon in   \nassessment and policy  mid-September 2005    \nrecommendations on  \u2022 International consultants\u2019 \nregional cooperation in \npapers/presentations \nthe Asia and Pacific \nsubmitted in mid-October \nregion during the 11FYP \n2005 \nperiod  \u2022 Domestic consultants\u2019 \n \ninterim reports finalized by \n \nend-February 2006  \n \n\u2022 Final report finalized by \n \nend-July 2006 ", "6    Appendix 1       \nDesign  Performance   Data Sources and  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \n   \nPart 3: Impact  \u2022 Framework agreed upon \nassessment and policy  by end-September 2005  \nrecommendations on  \u2022 International consultants\u2019 \nsubregional cooperation  papers/presentations \nin GMS and CAREC  submitted in mid-\nareas during the 11FYP  December 2005 \nperiod   \u2022 Domestic consultants\u2019 \n  interim reports finalized by \n  end-February 2006  \n\u2022 Final report finalized in \nmid-August 2006 \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \nGeneral TA Administration  \u2022  ADB: $500,000  \n1.
