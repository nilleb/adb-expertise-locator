During preparation of the Uttaranchal Power Sector Project, the Government of India \n(GOI) requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to accelerate project \nreadiness and facilitate start-up and first-year operations of the project management office (PMO) \nand  project  implementation  units  (PIUs).  The  Mission  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the rationale, objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, \nfinancing plans, and outline terms of reference for the TA.1 The TA  design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Uttaranchal was created on 9 November 2000 by separation from Uttar Pradesh. The \nstate is currently a net importer of electric power, but generates a seasonal surplus and plans to \nbecome a net exporter of power by 2010 by expanding hydropower and high-voltage transmission \ncapacity. Hydropower potential is approximately 20,000 megawatts (MW), of which less than \n1,200 MW is being used. Total capacity expansion of 10,000 MW is planned from the present \nthrough 2018.  With the creation of the state, the former State Electricity Board (SEB) was \ntransformed into three state-owned utility companies.  Uttaranchal Power Corporation Limited \n(UPCL) is responsible for distribution at 33 kilovolts (kV) and lower, rural electrification, and \npower trading.2 Power Transmission Corporation of Uttaranchal, Ltd. (PTCUL) is responsible for \nhigh-voltage transmission lines and substations from 132 kV to 400 kV.3 Uttaranchal Jal Vidyut \nNigam, Ltd. (UJVNL) takes the lead role in developing hydropower projects greater than 1 MW, \nand  manages  private  sector  participation.4  Private  sector  participation  is  open  for  over  40 \nhydropower plants (HPP) of less than 25 MW capacity and 13 projects ranging from 25 MW to \n100  MW.    The  Uttaranchal  Energy  and  Irrigation  Department  (UEID)  is  the  state-level \ncoordinating  agency  for  power  sector  development.  Uttaranchal  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (UERC), created in 2002, is the independent regulator for the sector.  UEID will be \nthe Executing Agency (EA) for the Project.  PTCUL and UJVNL will be the Implementing \nAgencies (IAs).   \n \n3.  The Project will support the development of sufficient power capacity to meet all in-state \ndemand and achieve a year-round exportable surplus by 2010.5 Expansion of UJVNL\u2019s small \nhydropower capacity will provide additional power to local grids in the project area, providing \ndirect social and economic benefits to residents. Expansion of PTCUL\u2019s state-level transmission \ngrid will (i) improve system reliability; (ii) facilitate intrastate, interstate, and interregional power \ntransfers; (iii) facilitate reduction in overall system losses; (iv) improve utilization of existing and \nplanned power plants; and (v) promote further development of a national electricity market by \nconnecting to the north region grid.  Parallel efforts by UPCL for rural electrification and local \ngrid improvements will complement ADB\u2019s intervention. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Uttaranchal was separated from Uttar Pradesh partly  to  foster  quicker  development  in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 24 February 2005. The TA was added to \nthe ADB. 2004. India Country Strategy and Program. Manila.  \n2  Power-generation units are also allowed to engage in power trading as per provisions in the Electricity Act of 2003. \nUttaranchal State policy currently allows power trading by Uttaranchal Power Corporation, Ltd. and Uttaranchal Jal \nVidyut Nigam, Ltd., with the intention of creating a power trading company in the near future.   \n3  Power Grid Corporation India Limited will operate 765-kV lines.  \n4  The Uttaranchal Renewable Energy Development Agency (UREDA) takes the lead role for projects of less than 1 \nMW.  UREDA also manages renewable energy projects, including off-grid development, with some support from \nbilateral funding agencies and nongovernment organizations. \n5  Interstate power sales will utilize lines of Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. \n ", "2   \nthe mountainous regions of the state.  The State Government of Uttaranchal (SGU) has taken a \nstrong leadership position on economic development, identifying power system expansion and \ntourism development as the pillars of economic growth.  There is a comprehensive power sector \ndevelopment  strategy  and  a  well-defined  sector  investment  program  that  is  moving  from \nconceptual design toward implementation. There is a substantial endowment of human capital \nin the form of senior technical staff in the EA and IAs.     \n \n5.  Along with the noted strengths, there is limited capacity to implement aid agency-funded \ninvestments.  The state has had very little financial support from external sources, limited \nprimarily to grant-funded TA.  The project EA\u2014UEID\u2014has some experience with externally \nfunded projects prior to separation from Uttar Pradesh, but has no experience in implementing \nADB loans. Likewise, the IAs (PTCUL and UJVNL) are relatively new companies and have no \nexperience  in  implementing  of  ADB  loans.    There  is  limited  recent  experience  with  large \ninfrastructure projects, and therefore limited adoption of state-of-the-art technologies in project \ndesign and execution.  Many of the senior technical staff are nearing retirement age; thus, there \nis an urgent need to develop the next generation of managerial and technical corps, especially \nin the IAs.   \n \n6.  On balance, there is a need for capacity building in the EA and IAs to implement the \nProject.  During  project  preparation  and  processing,  the  Government  of  India  and  SGU \nrequested additional assistance for project readiness to effectuate advance procurement action, \nprompt start-up of the PMO and PIUs, and first-year implementation of the Project.  The TA will \nprovide \u201cbridging\u201d assistance until consulting services funded by the Project are mobilized.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  TA  will  accelerate  project  readiness,  and  improve  project  management  and \nimplementation capabilities.  Consulting services will build the capacity of the PMO, PIUs, EA, \nand IAs during the first year of project implementation. TA activities will complement capacity- \nbuilding activities under part C of the loan Project.  The TA will result in improved institutional \ncapacity  in  the  EA  and  IAs,  and  will  promote  technology  transfer  for  project  design  and \nimplementation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will provide services directly to the PMO and PIUs. Consultants will provide \ndirect support for procurement activities, initial implementation of safeguards, and on-the-job \norientation on ADB project implementation procedures for PMO and PIU staff.  The TA will \nsupport formal training activities during the first year of project implementation to build the \ncapacity of the PMO and PIUs.  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  be  conducted  in  two  phases  covering  a  period  of  about  16  months, \nbeginning 1 September 2005 and ending 31 December 2006. Phase 1 comprises support for \nPMO and PIU start-up, advance procurement action, and initial implementation of environmental \nand social safeguards.  Phase 1 will last for about 8 months beginning in September 2005, \ncovering the issuance of tenders for the first several contract packages.  Phase 2 will overlap \nwith phase 1, beginning in January 2006, and will provide ongoing support for 12 months, \ncovering initial contract awards and disbursements. Reports prepared by the consultants will be \nintegrated into the project monitoring and progress reports to be submitted by the PMO to ADB.  ", "      3 \nThe consultants will ensure that all works and outputs under the TA fully comply with all relevant \nADB policies and guidelines.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, of which $260,000 is in \nforeign exchange and $365,000 equivalent is in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $240,000 \nequivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance local currency cost of $125,000 \nequivalent.  The TA cost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  Uttaranchal  Energy  and  Irrigation \nDepartment, which will appoint a senior staff member as the TA project director and counterpart \nstaff in the PMO.  The TA will provide services to the PMO established under UEID leadership, \nwhich comprises representatives of SGU, PTCUL, and UJVNL. The PMO will coordinate with all \ngovernment and nongovernment stakeholders.  \n \n12.  The TA will finance the services of international and domestic consultants who will be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Individual consultants will \nbe recruited using the direct selection method.  Equipment will be procured for PMO and PIU \noperations following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement or other procedures acceptable to ADB.  \nEquipment will be transferred to the PMO and PIUs at the end of the implementation period.  \n \n13.  International consultants will be engaged for a total of 10 person-months, and domestic \nconsultants for 32 person-months. The scope of work and terms of reference for consulting \nservices are presented in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  The consulting team will comprise experts in (i) ADB\u2019s procurement procedures; (ii) \ncontract  administration  and  management;  (iii)  accounting,  cost  control,  and  financial \nmanagement (including disbursement according to ADB procedures); (iv) implementation of \nenvironmental  management  programs  for  high-voltage  transmission  and  small  hydropower \nsystems; (v) implementation of programs mitigating social impact including land acquisition and \nresettlement; (vi) power system planning, design, construction, and commissioning; (vii) project \nappraisal including financial and economic analyses using ADB procedures and guidelines; (viii) \nhuman  resource  (HR)  development  and  planning;  and  (ix)  information  technology  (IT)  for \nelectronic procurement, financial management, a project management office (PMO) and project \nimplementation unit (PIU) operations, and long-term project management.
