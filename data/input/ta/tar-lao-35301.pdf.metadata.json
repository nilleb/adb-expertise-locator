The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has emphasized \nthe importance of private sector development (PSD) in the economy to facilitate small- and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) development as well as attract foreign direct investment (FDI) \nto promote sustainable development of the natural resource base. The Government recognizes \nSMEs\u2019 high potential to create jobs and reduce poverty, and FDI\u2019s high potential to mobilize \ninvestment, improve human resource skills development, and access technology and export \nmarkets. Therefore, the Government has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help \ndevelop SMEs1 and build capacity to mobilize FDI. As outlined in the technical assistance (TA) \nframework in Appendix 1, this advisory TA will start to address some legal and institutional \nconstraints  on  SME  development,  identified  under  earlier  TAs  by  ADB  and  other  funding \nagencies, through intensive capacity building. This TA will be followed by a project preparatory \nTA, which will design detailed policy and capacity-building programs to support reform in the  \nSME and PSD sector,2 and prepare a program loan as identified in the 2003 country strategy \nand  program  (CSP)  for  the  Lao  PDR.3 The  Fact-Finding  Mission  fielded  in  October  2003 \nreached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA  purpose,  approach,  and \nimplementation arrangements.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Average growth rate of about 6% for 2002 and 2003 was slightly higher than recent ones \nbut  falls  short  of  the  Government\u2019s  target  of  7%.  The  Lao  PDR  remains  dominated  by \nagriculture, which employs over 70% of the population, while manufacturing employs only about \n11%. Agriculture\u2019s share of gross domestic product (GDP) is slightly above 50%, and industry\u2019s, \n23%. A few large firms dominate the natural resources sector (mining and quarrying as well as \nelectricity)  to  produce  44%  of  industrial  output.  The  mostly  small  business-dominated \nmanufacturing sector produces 56% of industrial output. However, while approximately 22,0005 \nsmall businesses account for 98% of manufacturing activities and over 50% of commercial \nactivities, these firms employ on average less than five people. The firms\u2019 size and inability to \ninvest  constrains  labor  absorption.  By  comparison,  the  joint  venture-operated  textile \nmanufacturers  that  benefit  from  investment  incentive  programs,  create  over  50%  of \nmanufacturing jobs. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s  CSP  emphasizes  PSD  and  SME  development  to  reduce  poverty.  The \nGovernment\u2019s National Poverty Eradication Program also states that economic growth should \nbe hastened through strong PSD/SME sector development, combined with poverty-reducing \ninterventions, particularly in improving corporate governance, access to finance, and human \nresource skills development. Several recent ADB operations have supported this approach, \nincluding (i) the Banking Sector Reform Program, to lay the foundation for financial and legal \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 August 2003. \n2  The reform framework envisages three phases: (i) advisory TA\u2014December 2003\u2013December 2004, to integrate \ncapacity building in five ministries and the commercial banking sector to initiate and support the development of a \npro-business regulatory environment; (ii) project preparatory TA\u2014December 2004\u2013December 2005, to continue \nupgrading the legal and regulatory framework to support SMEs and PSD to prepare for the Sector Development \nProgram Loan (SDPL); and (iii)  SDPL, January 2006\u20132009. \n3  A $10-million SDPL is in the pipeline for early 2006. \n4  The Mission comprised M. Varkay (private sector development specialist), Governance, Finance, and Trade \nDivision, Mekong Department. \n5   Ministry of Industry and Handicraft and United Nations Industrial Development Organization. 2001.Survey of Small \nManufacturing Establishments 1999. Ventiane.  Based on firms with less than 10 employees. Most SMEs in this \ncategory are engaged in rice milling, textile manufacturing, and furniture making. ", " 2\ninfrastructure; 6  and  (ii)  a  programmed  Rural  Finance  Development  Project,  to  provide \nmicrofinance for rural (and household) SMEs.7  \n \n4.  The Government recognizes PSD and SME development as the cornerstone of overall \neconomic development and poverty reduction, and has drafted the SME decree8 to remove \npolicy  and  legal  obstacles  to  SME  growth.  The  decree  aims  to  (i)  improve  the  business \nregulatory  environment,  (ii)  enhance  SME  competitiveness,  (iii)  expand  domestic  and \ninternational market access, (iv) improve access to finance, (v) develop business organizations, \nand  (vi)  promote  entrepreneurial  activity.  The  major  aid  agencies  active  in  PSD/SME \ndevelopment  in  the  Lao  PDR  include  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  and \nUnited  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization  (UNIDO).  The  Mekong  Project \nDevelopment  Facility 9  has  a  presence  as  do  some  bilateral  agencies.  However,  no \ncomprehensive assistance package combines the sector development strategy (including policy \nand legal reform), financial assistance/loan, and TA. \n \n5.  Although the Lao PDR has started to upgrade the legal and regulatory framework to \nbuild a fair and competitive business environment, the Government should remove a number of \nobstacles to PSD and SME development by doing the following: \n \n(i)  Continue  training  judges  in  commercial  adjudication  and  dispute  resolution \nprocedures; review the major commercial laws (business, bankruptcy, trademark, \nforeign investment); and implement the Secured Transactions Law.10 \n(ii)  Initiate the review of foreign investment incentives, build capacity in national and \nprovincial governments in cost-benefit assessment of investment concessions, \nas well as the principles of project finance, and develop an investment review \ntracking  system.  Small  investors  are  especially  vulnerable  to  delay  in  the \nprocessing of their applications. \n(iii)  Raise the level of market intelligence and market information available to the \nprivate sector from the Government and Lao National Chamber of Commerce \nand Industry (LNCCI) to facilitate SME trade transactions. \n(iv)  Expand access to finance and provide information and training for SMEs in \nbusiness development services. \n(v)  Harmonize  registration  processes  of  enterprises  across  the  Government\u2014\nDepartment of Domestic and Foreign Investment (DDFI), Ministry of Commerce \n(MOC), Ministry of Finance (MOF)\u2014to enable cross-referencing of information on \nenterprises. Clarify the criteria for license issuance and for inspection to speed \nup enterprise registration.  \n(vi)  Register with MOF the large number of unregistered small businesses liable for \npresumptive  tax11 to  make  the  tax  collection  rate  and  fees  collected  from \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n7  Listed in the CSP for 2004. \n8  The SME decree was undertaken under a TA provided by UNIDO. The Government held wide consultations with \nthe donor community and private sector in the June 2002 workshop on SME development, supported by UNIDO. \n9  A review of the Mekong Project Development Facility\u2019s existing programs in the Lao PDR indicate that ADB will be \ntaking the lead in SME and PSD capacity building. The TA will be continue to coordinate closely with the facility as \nwell as other donors to avoid overlap. \n10 The proposed TA will support capacity-building activity initiated under TA 4002-LAO (ADB. 2002.Strengthening \nCorporate Governance and Management of State-Owned Commercial Banks II. Manila.)  that is developing a \ncommercial division of the court and training 18 nominated judges and related court registry staff and enforcement \nofficers to undertake commercial dispute adjudication resolution for nonperforming bank loans. The proposed TA \nwill extend the training of the judges in commercial law and related dispute settlement processes. \n ", "  3\nenterprises predictable. Introduce transparent and standardized criteria for tax \npayment based on factors such as size of establishment and commercial location. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The TA  purpose  is to help  the  Government  develop  an  integrated  institutional  and \nregulatory  capacity-building  framework  to  establish  the  foundation  for  PSD  and  SME \ndevelopment.  The  framework  will  be  consistent  with  and  supplementary  to  government \ndevelopment strategies and have the following components: \n \n7.  Support Implementation of the Small Medium Enterprise Decree. The TA will help \nfacilitate the implementation of the comprehensive draft SME decree. Its implementation is \nbeing discussed between the Implementing Agency (Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts) and \nother government agencies. As no adjustments are required to the decree, the TA will support \nits implementation and provide integrated capacity building to support major reforms in financial \nand  business  laws,  and  institutional  and  human  resource  development  to  foster  the \ndevelopment of a pro-business environment. The focus of TA capacity building is guided by the \nresults of in-depth analyses on the constraints to SME and PSD development undertaken under \nprevious  studies.12 The TA  will  gauge the  areas  where  institutional,  policy,  and  regulatory \nreforms need to be strengthened and thereby agree with the Government on the scope and \ndepth of reforms under the medium-term SME and PSD program, which will define a number of \ntime-bound policy actions based on international practice tailored to the Lao PDR. \n \n8.  Improve the Business Regulatory Environment through Legal and Governance \nReform for Small Medium Enterprise and Private Sector Development. The TA will support \nthe improvement of the commercial and financial framework through (i) implementation of an \nenhanced  Secured  Transactions  Law;13 (ii)  review  of  the  proposed  amendments  to  the \nenterprise,  bankruptcy,  foreign  investment,  and  trademark  laws;  and  regulations  on  the \nimplementation of the Standards Council,14 as proposed under previous TAs, to facilitate SME \ndevelopment and competitiveness; (iii) training of \u201ccommercial\u201d judges, supported by study \nmodules and review sessions in the application of the Secured Transactions Law and major \nbusiness laws, including dispute settlement and enforcement procedures; (iv) assess areas \nwhere nonjudicial forms of dispute resolution involving arbitration may be introduced; (v) provide \ninformation workshops on the role and use of the business laws to public sector officials and the \nprivate sector; and (vi) develop a blueprint for the secured transactions registry.  \n                                                                                                                                                       \n11 Refer to MOF Decision on the Administration of Tax Collection (Ref. 2262, 30/10/02), para. 2.2, on tax collected \nfrom small taxpayers or independent jobbers with annual turnover of less than KN100 million and presumptive tax \ncollection at the district level. \u201cThe tax base for calculation of presumptive tax is based on the estimation of monthly \nand annual turnover as a result of agreement reached between tax officials and taxpayers by drafting a contract of \npresumptive tax payment for a period of one year.\u201d This constraint is also reviewed in the draft National Poverty \nEradication Programme, chapter 3.2. \n12 TA-3737 LAO (ADB. 2001.Technical Assistance to the Lao PDR for Preparing the Financial Sector Development \nProgram. Manila.) and UNIDO SME Decree Development Technical Assistance. \n13 The revised law will strengthen the powers of the judiciary and the commercial banking sector\u2014part of the \nconditionality of the Banking Sector Reform Program Loan second-tranche release in 2004. The law will (i) \nsignificantly improve the ability of commercial banks to diversify portfolio risk, (ii) give SMEs access to finance on \nthe  basis  of  legally  defined  assets,  (iii)  improve  the  climate  for  consumer  protection,  and  (iv)  encourage \nparticipation of foreign banks and the development of domestic nonfinancial institutions. \n14 The Standards Council and supporting institutional framework will be developed under the second phase of TA-\n4108: Integrating the Poor in Regional Trade through Standard-Setting for Private Sector Development.  The TA \nwill provide regulatory support. ", " 4\n \n9.  Improve Enterprise Licensing and Registration. The TA will analyze the licensing \nsystem and delineate ways to relate the criteria of the licensing/inspection system developed \nunder the Standards Council to the jurisdiction of government agencies, and to firms\u2019 rights and \nresponsibilities. The TA will also initiate streamlining of registries and define common data \nrequirements across ministries.  \n \n10.  Establish a Small-Business Tax Pilot System in Vientiane. On a pilot basis, the TA \nwill study the criteria for small-business tax payment and review implementation procedures in \nVientiane in consultation with the Government and private sector. The TA will analyze the \nimpact of the tax regime on small businesses. Proposed changes to small-business tax rates \nwill control undesirable threshold effects. \n \n11.  Strengthen Domestic and Foreign Investment Review Procedures. The TA will (i) \nidentify the skills gaps in investment project review and train national and provincial DDFI staff \nin cost-benefit analysis of investment projects (mining, pulp and paper, agro-industry, textile \nmanufacturing); (ii) review the procedures of investment approval and identify required actions \nto streamline the approval process; and (iii) review the required upgrading of the Foreign \nInvestment Law as well as the registration of investment projects. \n \n12.  Develop Market Information and Market-Access Knowledge Networks. The TA will \nbuild the capacity of MOC and LNCCI in trade transaction procedures and development of \nmarket intelligence networks for the private sector. In the process the TA, with the Government, \nwill also identify the constraints on market access and competitiveness of enterprises and \nidentify policy reforms for review. The TA will provide capacity building to LNCCI and industry \nassociations to develop market-based services to facilitate SME access to foreign/domestic \nmarkets and technologies. \n \n13.  Identify Measures to Improve Small Medium Enterprise Access to Finance. Finally, \nthe TA will work with the international bank advisors under the Banking Sector Reform Program \nLoan to determine whether bank credit analysts are ready to undertake SME lending, and \nreview areas needing additional capacity building. The TA will develop a business development \nservice training program for SMEs to facilitate access to short- and medium-term credit as well \nas pre shipment finance15. Besides finding ways to enhance SMEs\u2019 access to bank credit, the \nTA will also analyze existing credit lines and other investment projects as well as credit training \nprograms for their effectiveness and complementarities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will proceed in two phases. During the first phase, a skills-training and capacity \nbuilding roadmap will be drawn up, to be reviewed with the Government and the private sector \nduring  the  inception  workshops,  and  implemented  over  the  second  phase.  To  facilitate \nconsultation and review, each TA stage will present a quarterly summary training and policy \nreview document to be reviewed in workshops with the Government and private sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $791,000 consisting of $557,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $234,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Governance Cooperation \n                                                \n15 The TA will also coordinate with the Private Sector Operations Department on trade finance matters.  \n ", "  5\nFund will provide joint cofinancing on a grant basis for $170,000. ADB will finance $500,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining  $121,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs  in  kind  by  providing  office \naccommodation, support facilities, communications, counterpart staff, and workshop support. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MOC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  ADB  has  also  requested  that  a  high-level \nconsultation  group  be  established,  headed  by  MOC,  which  will  meet  quarterly.  The \nimplementing agencies include the ministries of commerce, finance, industry, and justice; other \nrelevant government agencies; and LNCCI. Inputs from private sector representatives, including \nbusiness  associations,  as  well  as  other  stakeholders,  will  be  sought  throughout  TA \nimplementation. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from January 2004 to end-December 2004, \nand will require eight international (41 person-months total) and five domestic (25 person-\nmonths total) consultants. The international consultants will consist of a secured transactions \nspecialist, a judicial and legal reform expert, an investment project specialist, an SME finance \nand business development services expert, an enterprise licensing and registration expert, a tax \nexpert,  an  applied  trade  economist,  and  an  industry  association  expert.
