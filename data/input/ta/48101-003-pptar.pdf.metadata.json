Justification \n1.  The program preparatory technical assistance (TA) is required to prepare a results-\nbased lending (RBL) program for possible funding by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nsupport the development of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in Guizhou, \nthe People's Republic of China (PRC). Program components are likely to include development \nof demonstration TVET institutions (i.e., upgrading TVET facilities and provision of teaching \nequipment),  a TVET  resource  center to  build capacity for  practical TVET,  development of \ncompetency-based  curriculum,  promotion  of  industry  involvement,  and  design  and \nimplementation of institutional partnerships. The TA will be conducted in two parallel phases, \nwith the first phase focusing on initial design, and capacity support and awareness building for \nthe technical scope of the program, including through visits to other provinces and workshops to \ngain knowledge on TVET reforms and success models; and the second phase undertaking the \ndetailed design and program assessments for the RBL program. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  Phase 1 outputs will be conducted by individual consultants to undertake \n \n(i)  Program  design  and  management.

They will \nconduct  detailed  consultations  involving  stakeholders  from  the  Guizhou \nProvincial Government (GPG), representatives of public services sectors, and \ninvolved TVET schools on the problem tree analysis and the proposed results \nframework. The consultants will discuss and reach preliminary agreement with \nsenior  GPG  officials  and  the  executing  agency  on  the  (a)  program  impact, \noutcome,  outputs,  components,  and  activities;  (b)  preliminary  program \nexpenditure analysis; and (c) problem tree and results chain, with proposed DLI \nmatrix.

The  consultants  will  also  oversee  and  coordinate  the  overall  TA \noutputs to ensure that all the assessments are undertaken in accordance with \nADB requirements for RBL. They will review the technical design of the RBL \nprogram  to  assess  program  soundness  and  expenditure,  and  financing \nassessment to ensure that the initial program design is technically sound and \nmeets all relevant standards for ADB financing under the RBL modality.

The sector analysis will \ninclude a review of reports, studies, and policy papers prepared by the PRC \nprovincial and municipal governments, and international development agencies. \nThe national consultant will also organize study tours to relevant provinces in the \nPRC (e.g., Chongqing, Guangdong, and Hunan) for the GPG to learn from other \nmodels  of  TVET  reform  and  demonstration.  The  international  consultant  will \nassess the economic rationale of the program and prepare a report on the RBL \nprogram\u2019s effectiveness, efficiency and economy, and sustainability. Considering \nthe  review  and  international  best  practices,  the  consultants  will  assess  the \nprogram rationale, the soundness, and justification of the program and make \nrecommendations for the design of the RBL; and produce the draft program \nsoundness assessment.
