INTRODUCTION\n1. In response to a request from the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC),\nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) included assistance for strengthening the accountancy\nprofession in its medium-term country assistance plan. The reform of accounting and auditing\narrangements is a key element of the country\u2019s modernization program. To date, these reforms\nhave  proceeded  in  a  considered  and  determined  manner.  In  2000,  as  part  of  a  regional\ntechnical  assistance  (TA),  ADB  conducted  a  diagnostic  study  of  accounting  and  auditing\narrangements in the PRC.1 The study identifies several actions that if taken would improve\naccounting and auditing arrangements and supports TA request for the Chinese Institute of\nCertified Public Accountants (CICPA).2\n2. The 2000 country assistance program for the PRC includes a TA for strengthening the\naccountancy profession.3  An ADB mission visited the PRC in May 2001 to confirm and finalize\nthe objectives, scope, financing and implementation arrangements, and terms of reference of\nthe TA. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nII.       BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. In 1979, as part of the transition process, the PRC made an explicit decision to align\naccounting practices with the needs of a market economy. This posed several challenges. First,\nbookkeepers numbered in the tens of millions but the country had no qualified certified public\naccountants (CPAs), let alone a professional accounting body. Second, financial information on\nthe performance and position of organizations was not publicly available. In any case, as this\ninformation was produced under the Soviet accounting model, which the PRC followed for many\nyears, it did not meet international standards nor did it cater to the needs of investors or lenders.\nThird, the users of financial information were unfamiliar with what they should demand from\norganizations.  Fourth,  financial  information  was  not  independently  verified  (audited)  to\ninternational standards. Fifth, the legal framework was geared to central planning and specified\nexactly what information should be produced, how it should be produced, and to whom it should\nbe provided. Finally, the regulatory entities that generally exist in market economies to oversee\nfinancial disclosure practices, such as securities exchange commissions, did not exist.\n4. In the two decades since 1979, the PRC has progressed in terms of developing an\naccounting infrastructure suitable to the needs of a market economy. The first accounting firm\nwas established in 1981 as a subsidiary of a government organization; today about 4,800\naccounting  firms,  both  publicly  and  privately  owned,  are  in  operation.  In  1985,  the  first\nAccounting Law was enacted, setting out accounting responsibilities and procedures for state-\nowned enterprises.  In 1998, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) established CICPA, which now has\n135,000  members;  its  operations  are  governed  by  the  CPA  Law.    The  first  accounting\nstandards, based upon international accounting standards, were promulgated in 1992. MOF and\nCICPA are committed to improving accounting and auditing practices. To achieve this they have\ntaken, or are taking, the following steps to address concerns about the quality of accounting and\nauditing services provided by public accounting firms: (i) conduct a self-assessment campaign\n                  \n1 TA 5877-REG: Strengthening Financial Management and Governance in Selected Developing Member Countries,\nfor $430,000, approved on 14 December 1999.\n2 Narayan, Francis B., and Barry Reid. 2000. Financial Management and Governance Issues in the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China.  ADB: Manila.\n3 The TA, was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in April 2001.", "2\nof the profession; (ii) support structural reform of CPA firms; (iii) strengthen supervision; and (iv)\nincrease competition by opening up the market to foreign firms. The self-assessment campaign\nwas initiated by CICPA on its own accord and involved a countrywide process of inspections\nand reviews to critically analyze the state of the PRC\u2019s accountancy profession to strengthen\nthe profession and make it responsive to the market economy and modern practices. The\ncampaign was conducted between 1997 and 1999; and demonstrates the PRC\u2019s commitment to\nimproving professional standards. By its end, 12,700 individual CPAs and 580 CPA firms had\nbeen forced from the profession for various reasons, predominantly for not having the requisite\nlevel of knowledge; warnings and punishments were issued to a further 2,000 accounting firms\n(about 43 percent of the total).\n5. While CICPA is nominally an independent organization, it is under the supervision and\ndirection of MOF (major policies must be approved by MOF). Since 1991, aspiring CICPA\nmembers must have an approved accounting degree, pass a uniform CPA examination, and\ndemonstrate appropriate practical experience to gain membership. Each year, many candidates\nsit for the CPA examination\u2014some 530,000 candidates in 2000 alone\u2014making it one of the\nworld\u2019s largest practice-based certificate examinations. CICPA estimates that around 630,000\ncandidates will take the examination in 2001. The PRC\u2019s accountancy profession faces many\ncomplex issues in its development path; a description of four of these follows.\n6. First, CICPA has dealt with emerging issues in a competent and coordinated fashion.\nThe profession\u2019s challenge is to deal with future issues in a similar fashion. Consequently,\nCICPA has requested assistance to support the preparation of a development plan for the\naccountancy profession looking at a time horizon of 10-15 years. The plan would encompass\nprofessional development goals, professional administration, and administrative structures and\nsystems.\n7. Second, the self-assessment campaign was a successful short-term measure. On an\nongoing basis, improved supervision can have significant impacts on the quality and availability\nof  professional  services.  But  CICPA\u2019s  current  supervisory  resources  are  minimal  and\ninexperienced when compared with the number of CPAs and CPA firms, and in comparison with\nthose in more developed countries. In January 2000, an average of three staff in each provincial\nCPA institute were responsible for supervisory activities.  CICPA considers that the professional\nknowledge and experience of supervising staff falls short of the necessary requirements for\nsupervisory work.  Initiatives to strengthen professional supervision include the establishment of\nprovincial supervision teams; development of reporting systems in the key finance, securities,\nand  insurance  sectors;  and  experimental  introduction  of  peer  review  systems  common  in\ndeveloped market economies.\n8. Third, the uniform CPA examination was introduced in 1991. Since then, the growing\nnumber  of  examination  candidates  is  placing  increasing  pressure  on  management  of  the\nexamination  system.  Three  major  issues  with  the  existing  examination  system  are  (i)\nmanagement systems are predominantly manual (e.g., distribution of papers and notification of\nresults);  (ii)  examinations  are  held  only  once  each  year,  which  is  not  ideal  for  potential\ncandidates  and  exacerbates  organizational  issues;  improved  management  techniques  and\ntechnology would streamline the examination process; and (iii) examination preparation, grading\nprocedures, and general organization practices do not meet international standards.  Criticisms\nhave also been made that passing the examination is a test of memory, not of competence and\nknowledge. The system needs to be reviewed and modified accordingly.", "3\n9. Fourth,  CICPA  has  been  active  in  developing  training  materials  for  continuing\nprofessional education (CPE), but the rapidly changing environment combined with the dramatic\nincrease in membership and examination candidates are major challenges. Multimedia and\nInternet-based technologies present options to prepare interactive CPE training materials that\nare easily redeveloped to reflect the changing environment and can easily be distributed to\ndistant regions. This option needs to be seriously examined and introduced as appropriate.\n10. The  Government  has  pursued  accounting  reforms  with  vigor,  commitment  and\ndetermination; external funding agencies have backed these efforts. The World Bank supported\nthe development of accounting standards and is supporting the establishment of the National\nAccounting Institute.4  The activities under this TA are compatible with, and complementary to,\nthe efforts of other development agencies. The earlier regional TA5 identified the need for\nassistance to address these issues on the basis that CICPA (i) is determined to raise the\nstanding of the accountancy profession to best international practices but lacks the internal\nresources to determine which practices are most relevant to the PRC and how these might be\nintroduced;  and  (ii)  has  a  demonstrated  record  of  successful  project  implementation  as\nevidenced by the self-assessment campaign, among other things. Given CICPA\u2019s technical\nconstraints, the Government has requested ADB assistance to address the issues described in\nparas 6-9. The TA has high-level support through the direct involvement of CICPA\u2019s secretary-\ngeneral who is also the assistant minister of finance.\n11. The TA will also provide an opportunity for ADB to play an active role in the development\nof the accountancy profession. Potential future ADB roles in this area include the provision of\nsupport for curriculum enhancement and the development of educational facilities for CPAs,\nparticularly in the western part of the country.  While the TA objectives are in line with one of\nADB\u2019s core strategic areas of intervention of promoting good governance, it is also in conformity\nwith the cross-cutting strategic theme of promoting the role of the private sector in development,\nand ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy.6  Strengthening accounting and auditing practices will have a\ndirect bearing on the efficient management of enterprises. It will also contribute to enterprise\nreforms that ADB has been supporting. Improving financial management and strengthening\naudit functions are some of the measures that will lead to accountability and transparency,\nwhich are features of sound development management.\nIII.       THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n12. The overall goal of the TA is to support the PRC\u2019s continuing efforts to align accounting\narrangements and practices with the needs of a market economy and with best international\npractices.  To achieve this goal, the immediate TA objectives are to assist CICPA to (i) prepare\na  strategic  plan  for  the  development  of  the  accountancy  profession  while  ensuring  its\nindependence and impartiality, (ii) design and implement improved professional supervision\narrangements, (iii) raise professional standards by reforming the CPA licensure examination\nsystem, and (iv) improve training materials for CPE.\n                  \n4 Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loan ($60 million: 1992\u20131995) and Accounting Reform and   Development\nProject ($33 million: 1999\u20132004).\n5 RETA 5877 Strengthening Financial Management and Governance in Selected DMCs.\n6 ADB@1998.  Anticorruption Policies (On-line).  Available: http://www.adb.org./Anticorruption/default.asp", "4\nB. Scope\n13. The TA will assist CICPA in five areas.\n14. Preparation of a strategic plan for CICPA and the accountancy profession. The\nplan  will  encompass  professional  development  goals,  professional  administration,  and\nadministrative structures and systems.  Its preparation will involve (i) researching the present\nstatus  of  the  PRC  CPA  profession,  (ii)  analyzing  existing  problems  and  constraints,  (iii)\nexamining and drawing useful lessons from international experience in terms of the profession,\nand (iv) using this information and the associated analyses to formulate a development plan for\nCICPA and the accountancy profession covering a time horizon of 10-15 years.\n15. Improve supervisory mechanisms for  the accountancy profession. This will involve\n(i) studying the existing structures and processes of CPA firms; (ii) examining, and drawing\nuseful lessons from international experience with supervisory regimes (including peer review\nregimes); (iii) designing a supervisory system for the PRC that takes account of the country\u2019s\nsituation and provides sufficient flexibility to deal with environmental changes; (iv) implementing\nthe supervisory system and associated reporting systems; (v) reviewing and, where necessary,\nrevising CPA legal responsibilities and associated disciplinary regulations; and (vi) developing a\ntraining program to improve the competence and effectiveness of managers with supervisory\nresponsibilities.\n16. Reform the CPA examination system. Activities will include (i) investigating design\noptions for examination systems, (ii) establishing a database of examination questions, (iii)\nreviewing and reforming the grading system, (iv) examining the feasibility of and options for\ndeveloping an on-line examination system, (v) identifying suitable examination software and\nassisting  in  modifying  this  to  meet  CICPA  needs,  and  (vi)  implementing  changes  to\nmanagement procedures.\n17. Improve  the  development  and  delivery  of  CPE  training  materials.  Activities  will\ninclude (i) studying options for preparing and providing CPE training materials to CPAs, (ii)\ndeveloping a medium-to long-term plan for developing continuing professional education, (iii)\nstudying options for delivering CPE training materials using modern technology and developing\na training for trainers program, and (iv) developing a core set of CPE training materials for\nsenior and other professionals.\n18. Training senior officials on the implementation of TA activities. Officials will be\nprovided with training on selected specific areas covered under the TA.  The training will be\nprovided in countries that have a well-functioning accountancy profession.  In close consultation\nwith ADB, CICPA, and MOF, the training programs will be organized by the team leader of the\ninternational consultants to be engaged under the TA.\nC.      Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19. The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 equivalent, including a foreign exchange cost of\n$410,000 and local currency cost of $340,000 equivalent.  ADB will provide $600,000 equivalent\nto cover the entire foreign exchange costs and $190,000 equivalent of the local currency costs.\nThe  financing  will  be  provided  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  Program.  The\nGovernment  and  CICPA  will  contribute  $150,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  remaining  local\ncurrency requirements. Details of the cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2.", "5\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n20. MOF will be the Executing Agency and CICPA the Implementing Agency. CICPA will\nprovide the necessary office space with office facilities, as well as secretarial and logistical\nsupport for the consultants, including local transportation. The TA budget provides for the\npurchase  of  some  office  equipment  to  be  procured  by  the  consultants  based  on  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on Procurement. CICPA will also provide counterpart staff for each of the activities\nso that local staff can assist the consultants and learn. CICPA will be responsible for most of the\ndocument translation including the input documents but excluding the consultants\u2019 reports,\nwhich will be financed by ADB. A TA office will be established to implement the TA. The TA\ndirector will be the assistant minister of finance and the deputy project director will be the vice-\nsecretary-general of CICPA. The TA office will establish a steering comittee to oversee and\ncoordinate the TA activities. The assistant minister of finance will chair the steering committee,\nwhich will comprise representatives from CICPA, MOF, and the China National Audit Office. In\naddition to the steering committee, a task force will be formed and chaired by the deputy project\ndirector of the TA office. The task force will provide the interface between the consultants and\nthe profession. The task force will comprise members from other interest groups such as the\nNational Accounting Institute and representatives of selected CPA firms.\n21. A mini workshop will be held for each activity to get feedback on the consultants\u2019\nrecommendations from interested groups. Subsequent to the submission of the draft final report,\na  larger  workshop  will  be  held  to  disseminate  and  discuss  the  TA  findings  and\nrecommendations. The TA will be implemented over 12 months from about October 2001 to\nSeptember 2002.\n22. The TA will require a total of 41 person-months of consulting services, including 11\nperson-months of international consulting and 30 person-months of domestic consulting. The\ninternational consultants will include (i) an examination and training specialist; (ii) a quality\ncontrol specialist, and (iii) a strategic planning specialist.\n23. The domestic consultants will include two training and examination specialists and one\nexpert  in  strategic  planning  and  quality  control.  The  team  of  international  and  domestic\nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of consultants. Given that it may be\ndifficult to recruit such a diverse range of expertise from one firm, the international consultants\nwill be recruited as individuals or through an established institution, such as a professional\naccountancy body or an educational institution. Domestic consultants, given the shortage of\nlocal skills, will be recruited as individuals. The international expert on examination systems will\nbe  the  team  leader  and  take  responsibility  for  the  quality  of  the  overall  TA  output.  The\nconsultants will produce an inception report; a draft final report will be due two weeks prior to\nthe conclusion of the consultants\u2019 assignments. At the end of the assignment, the final report will\nbe produced taking into account the comments of ADB, CICPA and MOF. The consultants\u2019\nterms of reference are in Appendix 3.\nIV.       THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n24. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic\nof  China  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $600,000  for  the  purpose  of\nStrengthening the Accountancy Profession, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary  Performance Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\nIndicators/Targets\nGoal\nTo support the continuing efforts of the People\u2019s Align accounting and auditing Feedback from Government, Commitment of the Government\nRepublic of China (PRC); to strengthen the arrangements and practices with private sector, professional to implement recommendations\naccountancy profession. international best practices and to accounting and auditing\nmeet the needs of a market practitioners\neconomy.\nPurpose\n1.
