Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  core \nAssessment  subprojects were prepared. An environmental assessment review \nprocedure  was  prepared  to  guide  subproject  selection  and \nenvironmental assessment during implementation.  \n   \nProject Description  The Domestic Maritime Support (Sector) Project will improve the \nsafety  and  efficiency  of  domestic  maritime  transport  services \nthrough (i) civil works to construct about 12 rural wharves, and (ii) \nestablishment of a franchise shipping scheme (FSS) to support \nservice provision to remote communities using an output-based \napproach.  \n   \nRationale  Solomon Islands is still emerging from several years of conflict \nand  is  one  of  the  least  developed  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB's) Pacific developing member countries. The country \nis ranked second-lowest among Pacific island countries in the \nUnited  Nations\u2019  Human  Development  Index,  and  is  unlikely  to \nmeet most of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \n \n  As a poorly developed and weakly performing nation, Solomon \nIslands faces many challenges. The socioeconomic situation is \ncharacterized by low per capita growth, high unemployment, and \none  of  the  highest  population  growth  rates  in  the  world. \nRevitalization  of  the  rural  economy  is  thus  a  key  strategy  in \nreducing poverty. \n \n  The economy is based on primary commodities from agriculture, \nforestry, and fishing. Most production takes place in remote rural \nareas without adequate transport infrastructure and services. To \nconnect the six main islands and smaller island groups in order to \nfacilitate economic and social development, maritime transport is \nvital. \n \n  Transport sector planning, financing, and maintenance have long \nbeen inadequate, so that most facilities are in poor condition and \nneed  rehabilitation.  Many  locations  lack  suitable  maritime \ninfrastructure  and  do  not  receive  regular  shipping  services. \nInstitutional  capacity  in  the  Marine  Division  of  the  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure  Development  is  weak,  causing  poor  sector \ngovernance. ", "ii   \n \n  Rehabilitated  wharves  and  jetties  will  improve  safety  and \naccessibility  for  economic  and  social  activities,  and  increase \nproductivity and reduce costs for ship operators, leading to more \nefficient port calls and the possibility of greater service frequency. \n \n  Improved shipping services will reduce barriers to market access \nand promote the growth of rural production. Creation of an FSS \nwill  allow  private  sector  operators  to  provide  services  to \ncommercially  unviable  destinations.  Using  an  output-based \napproach  effectively  aligns  incentives  for  the  private  sector  to \nprovide  socially  desired  services,  thus  combining  transport \nimprovements with private sector development. \n \n  Remote  communities  without  reliable  maritime  services  are \namong  the  poorest  areas  of  Solomon  Islands.  Geographic \ntargeting  of  improved  infrastructure  and  services  can  catalyze \ngrowth and have a disproportionate impact on poverty.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be reduced economic disadvantage \nin remote rural areas. The outcome will be interisland shipping \nservices that are frequent, reliable, and safe.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $21.40 million, \nincluding taxes of $0.72 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource    Total    Percent \nAsian Development Bank  14.00  65.40 \nEuropean Commission  5.25  24.60 \nGovernment of Solomon Islands  2.15  10.00 \n      Total  21.40  100.00 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2019 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2018 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 10 years. Civil works will be \nArrangements  completed in 4 years, whereas the FSS will be completed over 10 \nyears. Both components will follow the same initial schedule as \nfollows: detailed design, preparation of bidding documents, and \ntendering will start in January 2009; award of contracts for civil \nworks and franchises is expected by December 2009; physical \ncompletion of civil works will be by 31 December 2012; completion \nof the FSS will be by 31 December 2018; and grant closing will be \nby 30 June 2019. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Infrastructure Development \n   ", "  iii\nProcurement  Procurement  under  the  Project,  including  for  ADB  and \nGovernment-financed  packages,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Major  civil \nworks  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  Franchise  tenders  and  minor  civil  works  will  be \nawarded  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nCommunity  procurement  through  the  shopping  method  will  be \nused for maintenance contracts. \n   \nConsulting Services  International and domestic consulting services will be required for \n(i) engineering design and preparation of bidding documents, (ii) \nconstruction  supervision,  (iii)  project  management,  and  (iv) \nfinancial management. The Project will fund 94 person-months of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  164  person-months  of \nnational consulting services. Consulting services will be engaged \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nTo facilitate joint cofinancing with the European Commission (EC), \nBoard approval is sought to allow procurement of eligible goods \nand services from countries eligible for procurement under the EC \nregulations, which are not ADB member countries. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  improve  shipping  services  to  support  rural \nBeneficiaries  development,  spur  economic  growth,  and  reduce  poverty  by \nfacilitating access to markets and economic and social services. \nMore reliable transport services will increase the ability of rural \npopulations  to  market  their  produce  and  derive  income  from \nnatural resources.  \n \n  Direct benefits will include more frequent and reliable shipping \nservices  at  lower  cost.  Induced  benefits  will include  increased \nagricultural  production  and  better  terms  of  trade  for  remote \ncommunities. The beneficiaries will be people in the poorest parts \nof the country.  \n \n  Investment  subprojects  will  be  assessed  based  on  their \ncontribution  to  national  development  objectives  and  priorities. \nSelection  criteria  will  require  subprojects  to  be  economically \nviable, with a target economic internal rate of return greater than \n12%. Poverty and social analysis at the subproject level will be \ngender disaggregated, taking into account the differential project \nimpacts and risks facing women. The Project will be proactive in \nensuring HIV/AIDS prevention. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The project design considers potential technical, financial, and \ninstitutional  risks  associated  with  project  management, \nrehabilitation quality, financial management, and commitment to \nreform. The Project will establish a project management unit to \nstrengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  handle  increased \nresponsibilities. A team of international and national consultants \n ", "iv   \nwill assist with implementation. Assurances regarding institutional \nreforms have been included. \n \n  Environmental  impacts  will  be  monitored  through  construction \nsupervision and mitigated at the rehabilitation stage in accordance \nwith approved environmental management plans. \n \nTechnical Assistance  Technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  provided  to  establish  the \nSolomon Islands Maritime Safety Administration, by reforming the \nexisting  Marine  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure \nDevelopment, to take responsibility for all aspects of regulatory \ncontrol over the maritime sector and enhance safety of shipping \nand port operations. Its expanded functions will include regulation \nand  oversight  of  marine  safety  through  vessel  registry,  safety \ninspection, licensing of seafarers, search and rescue, navigation \naids, and environmental protection.  \n \n  The  TA  will  fund  28  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices and 44 person-months of national consulting services to \nprovide  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development. \nConsulting  services  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm  using  the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n  The total cost of the TA is $1,925,000. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  ADB  TA  funding  program,  which  will \ncontribute  $1,000,000.  The  EC  will  provide  cofinancing  of \n$600,000. The Government will contribute $325,000.  \n ", " ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant, and (ii) a proposed administration of a grant from the European Commission (EC), both to \nSolomon Islands for the Domestic Maritime Support (Sector) Project. The report also describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Establishment of the Solomon Islands Maritime Safety \nAdministration, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Solomon Islands is a large Melanesian island country, with a land area of about 28,000 \nsquare kilometers, six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and hundreds of islets and atolls. \nOver 80% of the population of 540,000 is rural, living in widely dispersed villages of a few \nhundred persons. The country is fragile, weakly performing, and still emerging from several \nyears  of  conflict  from  1999\u20132003.  It  is  one  of  the  least  developed  among  ADB\u2019s  Pacific \ndeveloping member countries (PDMCs). The country is unlikely to meet most of the Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  by  2015.  Socioeconomic  indicators  include  high  unemployment,  high \npopulation growth, and slow economic growth which combine to exacerbate poverty. \n \n3.  The economy is based on primary commodities from agriculture, forestry, and fishing. \nMost production takes place in remote rural areas without adequate transport infrastructure and \nservices.  To  connect  the  six  main  islands  and  smaller  island  groups  in  order  to  facilitate \neconomic and social development, maritime transport is vital. The project impact, outcomes, \noutputs, and activities are shown in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \n4.  Sector planning, financing, and maintenance have long been inadequate, so that most \nfacilities  are  in  poor  condition  and  need  rehabilitation.  Institutional  capacity  in  the  Marine \nDivision  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  is  weak,  causing  poor  sector \ngovernance, ineffective safety regulation, poor compliance with international obligations, weak \nenvironmental management, inadequate hydrographic charts, and limited search and rescue \ncapacity. A sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n5.  Despite  two  international  ports,  about  86  rural  wharves  and  jetties,  and  numerous \nunimproved  anchorages  throughout  the  country,  many  locations  lack  suitable  maritime \ninfrastructure and do not receive regular transport services. Revenues generated by maritime \nfees have not been sufficient to fully fund capital improvements or maintenance. In recent years, \ncapital  investment  in  rural  maritime  infrastructure  has  been  financed  entirely  by  external \nassistance, which has totaled $34 million over the past 10 years, as shown in Appendix 3. \n \n6.  Interisland  shipping  services  are  operated  by  about  20  private  sector  operators, \nsupplemented by a few churches and provincial governments. Some routes are commercially \nviable because of their proximity to the national capital and comparatively high demand for \npassenger and cargo services. In contrast, some remote destinations receive only occasional \nunreliable services due to long distances and low passenger and cargo demand. To provide \nservices to uneconomic destinations, the Marine Division occasionally charters or subsidizes \nvessels on an ad hoc basis, but their unpredictability constrains domestic and international trade \nand hampers delivery of public services.  ", "2 \n1.  Government\u2019s Sector Strategy \n7.  The  policies,  strategies,  and  priorities  of  the  Government  for  development  of  the \ntransport system are articulated in the National Transport Plan 2007\u20132026 (NTP). To achieve \nthe vision of \u201can effective transport infrastructure and transport services to support sustained \neconomic growth and social development in Solomon Islands,\u201d the NTP sets out a strategic \nframework to (i) develop transport services, (ii) develop and maintain physical infrastructure, (iii) \nimprove the capacity of Government agencies, and (iv) develop the private sector. The NTP \n(Appendix 2) is supported by a 3-year rolling work program that serves as the Government\u2019s \nsector development plan as required for implementation of a sector project. \n \n8.  The  NTP  includes  appropriate  policies  to  provide  maritime  infrastructure  to  support \ninterisland shipping services by (i) providing annual funding for the maintenance of wharves and \nnavigation aids, (ii) adopting assessment criteria for rural facilities based on economic viability \ntogether with social and development benefits, (iii) ensuring higher-quality construction and \nrehabilitation to improve life cycle costs, (iv) preparing a 10-year program of rehabilitation and \nconstruction,  (v)  using  external  assistance  where  available  for  civil  works  to  preserve \nGovernment funds for maintenance, and (vi) improving planning and asset management.  \n \n9.  The NTP also includes policies for the development of regular, reliable, and efficient \nshipping services by (i) promoting the ongoing development of private operators, (ii) establishing \na system for financial assistance where services are not commercially viable, (iii) exploring \noptions for improving access to finance for vessels, (iv) seeking external assistance for training \nin business management, (v) improving safety through legislative and regulatory reforms, and \n(vi) initiating consultations to reform restrictive provincial licensing practices.  \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy and Program   \n10.  To support development and reduce poverty, ADB\u2019s partnership strategy1 in Solomon \nIslands  aims  at  rapid,  pro-poor  and  private-sector-led  economic  growth  by  (i)  providing \ntransportation infrastructure and services, and (ii) strengthening the enabling environment for \nthe private sector. Capacity development and the promotion of good governance are cross-\ncutting priorities. The strategy directly supports key priorities in the Government\u2019s development \nframework,2 addresses binding constraints to growth,3 is in line with ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy,4 \ntakes  into  account  ADB\u2019s  comparative  advantage  among  development  partners,  and  is \nconsistent with internationally adopted principles of international engagement in fragile states. \n \n11.  ADB has provided extensive assistance to the transport sector in Solomon Islands in \nrecent years. The Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project5 was completed in late 2007. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

TA has also been provided \nfor  institutional  strengthening,  diagnostic  assessment,  and  implementation  of  reforms.8 To \ncontinue integrating the transport network and extending access to remote areas, improved \nmaritime facilities and services are required.  \n \n12.  In recognition of ADB\u2019s experience in implementing projects and TA in the transport \nsector  in  Solomon  Islands,  the  Government  requested,  and  through  a  well-established \ncoordination process other partners agreed, that ADB take the lead role in the transport sector. \nADB\u2019s strategy complements other external assistance by creating an integrated transportation \nsystem to link rural areas to urban centers for access to markets and social services.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n13.  As  a  weakly  performing  country  emerging  from  several  years  of  conflict,  Solomon \nIslands faces many development problems. The most pressing issues include (i) sustained \neconomic  growth,  (ii)  economic  restructuring  away  from  forestry  to  other  productive  rural \nactivities, (iii) increased employment and income-generation opportunities, (iv) an improved \ninstitutional framework to manage public sector responsibilities, and (v) improved human and \ninstitutional capacity. Improvements in these areas will contribute directly to poverty reduction.  \n \n1.  Problems and Constraints  \n14.  Economic Restructuring, Growth, Employment, and Income Generation. Solomon \nIslands\u2019 heavy reliance on unsustainable large-scale forestry must be reduced, and replaced \nwith  other  productive  rural  activity.  However,  agricultural  development  is  hampered  by \ndeteriorating  rural  infrastructure,  poor  access  to  markets,  and  low-productivity  traditional \ncultivation.  Private  sector  development  is  also  constrained  by  unreliable  and  expensive \ninfrastructure and services, a weak legal and institutional business environment, and a limited \nmarket. Employment growth and income generation are therefore severely constrained.   \n \n15.  Sector Investments, Operations, and Sustainability. Sustainability requires increased \ninvestments  and  improved  maintenance.  Due  to  deferred  maintenance,  deteriorated  rural \nfacilities hinder service provision and pose a safety risk. Global climate change is expected to \ncause sea level rise and increase vulnerability to natural hazards. Both factors increase the \nneed for robust construction and better maintenance. To sustain investments, the Government \nneeds to improve its sector planning, funding, and asset management. The Government has \ninitiated  establishment  of  the  National  Transport  Fund  (NTF)  to  increase  predictability  of \nresource allocation and sustainability of operations and maintenance, but it is undercapitalized \nand managed under temporary arrangements. There is a need to formalize the NTF.  \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2006.

Maritime Network Development and Service Provision. In addition to the constraints \nposed by poor physical infrastructure, long distances and low demand for cargo and passenger \nservices mean that it is not commercially viable for operators to provide services to some \nremote destinations. Services are often delayed for weeks or months, and sometimes cancelled, \nleaving people and cargo stranded. To provide socially desired services on these routes, the \nMarine Division of MID frequently charters vessels or subsidizes operators on routes assumed \nto be unviable. Furthermore, deficiencies in maritime safety regulation and enforcement are \nendemic. These factors constrain provision of reliable and safe services. \n \n17.  Geographic  Disparities.  Remote  communities  in  the  project  areas  lack  reliable \nmaritime services and are among the poorest areas of Solomon Islands. The project areas have \na higher incidence of poverty than the national average, lower agricultural productivity, and \ngreater constraints in access to transport services.9 Voyages to outer islands involve greater \ndistances in less-protected waters and thus require larger vessels with higher operating costs, \nwhich lead to lower service frequencies.  \n \n18.  Private  Sector  Development.  Most vessels are operated by small companies with \nlimited management expertise and chronic need for training. Many ships are old and thus \nmaintenance and operating expenses are high. Meanwhile, some provincial governments apply \nrestrictive licenses and fees to operators from other provinces to protect services provided by \ntheir own provincial development authorities. Private sector operators consequently do not face \na level playing field in providing services to all destinations.  \n \n19.  Institutional Capacity. Institutional capacity constraints have hindered the ability of MID \nand  the  Marine  Division  to  develop  and  implement  sector  plans and  policies. The  human \nresource base is low as a result of declining public sector budgets, poor training, and conflict-\nrelated  impacts.  Managerial,  administrative,  and  technical  skills  are  in  short  supply.  The \nGovernment\u2019s response is slowly improving and is in need of consolidation so that the Marine \nDivision  can  fully  implement  its  role  in  safety  enforcement,  search  and  rescue,  aids  to \nnavigation, hydrographic charting, and environmental protection. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n20.  Rural economic development can be significantly enhanced through safe, reliable, and \nefficient rural maritime transport. Clear opportunities exist to improve performance and increase \nbenefits  through  a  comprehensive  approach  of  asset  investment  and  maintenance,  sector \nplanning and promotion of service provision, private sector participation, and institutional reform \nand  capacity  development.  Improved  infrastructure  and  services  are  essential  to  removing \nbarriers to market access and promoting the growth of rural production, which will revitalize the \nrural economy and ultimately reduce poverty. \n \n21.  Improved  Maritime  Infrastructure.  Rehabilitated  wharves  and  jetties  will  improve \nsafety,  accessibility,  and  productivity  for  users.  Improved  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  and \noperation of maritime infrastructure will reduce costs for operators and users due to more \nefficient port calls, which in turn will allow more frequent and reliable services. The potential for \nclimate change means that project designs can improve adaptation by anticipating sea level rise \nand increased natural hazards through higher decks and more robust construction. \n                                                 \n9  Solomon Islands Government. 2006.

Support  for  Service  Provision. Improved shipping services will reduce barriers to \nmarket access and promote the growth of rural production through increased reliability, allowing \nproducers to generate higher-quality products and reduce spoilage. It will also allow better \naccess to health care and delivery of public services. Creation of an FSS can induce private \nsector  operators  to  provide  services  to  commercially  unviable  destinations  by  providing \ncompetitively tendered subsidies tied to performance specifications. Experience in Solomon \nIslands and elsewhere shows that the output-based approach will improve service quality and \nsustain service provision.10 \n \n23.  Geographic  Targeting.  Improved  services  and  infrastructure  in  project  areas  are \nexpected to have a disproportionate impact on poverty by catalyzing growth in poorer areas. \nImproved access to export markets will reduce peoples\u2019 reliance on large-scale commercial \nexploitation  of  natural  resources  and  afford  opportunities  for  artisanal  production  within \ncommunities. Regular, reliable, and more frequent shipping services to remote areas will also \nimprove people\u2019s access to income earning opportunities, and contribute significantly to health \nand wellbeing by enabling access to education, health care, public services, and social events.  \n \n24.  Private Sector Development. Creation of an FSS and provision of targeted subsidies is \nexpected to have a catalytic effect on both private sector ship operators and rural agricultural \nproducers. By providing reliable scheduled services, producers should increase their output and \nlose less of it to spoilage. Increased demand for cargo and passenger services should in turn \nmake  rural  routes  commercially  viable  over  time.  Predictable  long-term  funding  of  capital \ninvestments  and  maintenance  through  the  NTF  will  also  increase  the  ability  of  domestic \ncontractors to invest in and develop sustainable businesses. \n \n25.  Institutional Reform and Capacity Development. The Government is in the process of \nunifying its development and recurrent budgets to improve the link between investments and \nmaintenance.  Government  planning  and  financial  management  reforms  under  way  at  the \nnational level can be strengthened by extension to the maritime sector. Funding arrangements \nfor  franchise  shipping  operations  and  for  maintenance  of  maritime  infrastructure  will  be \nenhanced by the implementation of the NTF and NTP, supported by implementation assistance \nwhich includes capacity development. Restructuring and development of the Marine Division will \ncomplement these reforms, by strengthening maritime administration through TA (paras. 62-65).  \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n26.  Previous  ADB  and  EC  assistance  to  the  maritime  transport  sector  for  physical \ninfrastructure  investments,  supported  by  institutional  capacity-enhancement  measures,  has \nbeen mostly successful by focusing project scopes on well-defined areas supported by advisory \nservices for design and institutional development purposes. Conversely, previous construction \nmethods for wharf structures have been technically flawed by not providing adequate durability \nand structural stability, resulting in deterioration and eventual loss of assets. These lessons are \nincorporated in the design of the Project, based on designs that have evolved to suit local \nconditions, using improved design standards and materials.  \n \n                                                 \n10 A similar franchise scheme for six routes in the Fiji Islands, developed under ADB TA, resulted in passenger growth \nof 62% and cargo growth of 80% within the first 2 years of instituting reliable services. ADB. 1995. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the Transport Sector Institutional Strengthening. Manila (TA 2321-\nFIJ). Franchise schemes have also been proposed in the Marshall Islands and Papua New Guinea. See footnote \n11 for references and Supplementary Appendix E for details. \n ", "6 \n27.  ADB has experience in domestic maritime projects in several PDMCs that instituted \nFSSs, from which three main lessons emerge.11 First, clear specifications for routes, frequency, \nvessel  type,  and  capacity  are  needed  to  ensure  successful  route  tenders,  performance \nmonitoring, and payment certification. Second, flexible franchise contracts are needed to allow \noperators to adapt to weather and market conditions in meeting these specifications. Third, \npredictability of funding is needed to give operators certainty for planning and investment.  \n \n28.  ADB has also implemented trust funds in the transport sector in two PDMCs.12 In Tuvalu, \nthe Falekaupule Trust Fund was created to fund island development projects. In Papua New \nGuinea,  the  Community  Water  Transport  Fund  provides  subsidies  for  delivery  of  transport \nservices  to  remote  communities.  Fund  arrangements  must  be  explicit  about  governance \nmechanisms and disbursement criteria. Because government experience with this approach is \noften limited, outsourcing management of the fund to the private sector, combined with capacity \ndevelopment to supervise arrangements, is necessary for effective supervision. \n \n29.   To  improve  sustainability,  the  Project  will  require  engineering  designs  to  employ \nconservative assumptions of climate change and sea level rise and to use improved materials to \nminimize maintenance.13 To increase local ownership of new infrastructure, ADB has instituted \na new approach to community engagement for infrastructure maintenance through experience \nwith ongoing projects in Solomon Islands (footnotes 5\u20137). This approach is both cost effective \nand sustainable, and can also be used to involve rural communities in maintenance of wharves. \nThe Project will continue to employ a community engagement model for maintenance. \n \n30.  To improve government planning and oversight, previous ADB TA (footnote 8) has \nrevealed the need to improve institutional effectiveness through capacity development and \nmulti-year external support. As with other recent projects, a project management unit will be \nestablished and will pursue capacity development for national staff to continue to improve \nplanning, financial management, operations, and maintenance. The Executing Agency's (EA\u2019s) \ncapacity to implement a sector project, when supplemented by implementation assistance, has \nbeen demonstrated through two other ADB-funded sector projects (footnotes 6 and 7). \n \n4.  Rationale for the Project \n31.  Pro-poor economic growth and improvement in social and health indicators depend on \nrevitalization and decentralization of the rural economy. The poor condition of maritime transport \nis a significant constraint to the movement of people and goods, and thus a disincentive to \nproductive rural activity. Improved transportation infrastructure and services, and thus reliable \naccess to domestic and international markets for rural produce and commodities, is a key \nstrategy to restart and build rural economies, reduce migration in search of employment, reduce \nconflict between groups competing for limited opportunities, and restore basic social services in \nrural areas. The focus on improving rural accessibility will increase the poverty reduction impact.  \n \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 1996.

Most previous projects supported through external assistance have focused on road \nsector investment to improve accessibility to economic and social activities, but these have \nbeen based in more populous areas on the main islands. To promote economic development \nand rural employment more broadly, it is necessary to improve transport between the six main \nislands and some of the smaller island groups. The Government requested preparation of the \nProject, with a focus on addressing urgent needs in more remote areas of the country.  \n \n33.  The  Government  has  embarked  on  institutional  reforms,  with  ADB  assistance,  to \ndevelop its capacity to effectively implement a sector project. The existing policy framework and \naction plan in the NTP guides the use of domestic and external resources to reduce constraints \ncaused  by  maritime  network  conditions.  Restructuring  of  MID  is  under  way,  and  can  be \nconsolidated through implementation assistance and capacity building under the Project. TA for \ninstitutional reform and strengthening is described in paras. 62-65 and Appendix 10.  \n \n34.  These considerations present opportunities to consolidate reform. Given the widespread \nneed for rehabilitation of maritime infrastructure and reliable and safe service provision, it is \nnecessary  to  address  these  issues  in  parallel  across  all  aspects  of  the  sector.  Integrated \ntransport  planning  through  domestic  processes  will  promote  effective  planning  and \nimplementation of works in the long term. The Project and TA will ensure that the Government \nhas the institutional framework and capacity to effectively implement such an approach.   \n \n35.  The Project represents the direct implementation of ADB\u2019s strategy for Solomon Islands \nby upgrading and preserving transportation infrastructure, facilitating expanded transportation \nservices, improving the enabling environment for private sector development, and providing \nopportunities for direct private sector participation. In these respects, the Project is also closely \naligned with the Government\u2019s priorities and strategic plans.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n36.  The Project is expected to reduce economic disadvantage in remote rural areas. The \noutcome will be interisland shipping services that are frequent, reliable, and safe. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n37.  The project has two major components: component A will construct rural wharves and \njetties; component B will establish an FSS to support rural transport services through an output-\nbased approach. Subprojects for both components will be analyzed and approved using the \nsector project modality. \n \n38.  Component  A:  Improvement  of  Rural  Infrastructure.  The  Project  will  finance  a \nportion of the Government\u2019s planned maritime infrastructure works as documented in the NTP. \nOutputs will include about 12 wharves and jetties for either rehabilitation or reconstruction. Civil \nworks will be undertaken primarily in remote areas of provinces that experience a greater \nincidence of poverty than the national average. Recurrent funding for maintenance through \ncommunity contracts, supported by training, will be provided to improve sustainability. \n \n39.  Component B: Establishment of a Franchise Shipping Scheme. The Project will \ndesign and implement an FSS to award franchises for provision of shipping services to remote \nareas  that  are  considered  commercially  unviable.  Seven  routes  have  been  identified  as \n ", "8 \nunviable. Outputs will be increased transport services on these routes, through subsidies to \nprivate sector operators, based on a minimum-subsidy tender process. Initial contracts will be \nfor 3 years, with longer periods for subsequent terms possible.14  \n \n40.  Under the output-based approach, subsidies will be tied to performance, including vessel \nsuitability  (dimensions,  capacity,  and  safety  certification),  franchise  areas  and  routes,  call \nlocations and frequency, substantiation of calls and submission of voyage data, and flexibility for \nforce majeure. During the initial contract period regular reviews will be carried out to ensure that \nactual revenue and costs are aligned with prior estimates, and the contract provisions will allow \nterms to be reviewed in response to actual results. Subsidies required will reduce over time, as \nroutes become commercially viable. Each of the seven routes is expected to reach a break-\neven point 5\u201310 years after commencement. Details are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n41.  The legal basis to implement the FSS will be established in a proposed Maritime Reform \nBill.15 Administrative and operational responsibility shall be vested in MID to ensure that matters \nof safety and legal compliance by franchisees are addressed (paras 62-65). The Government \nhas introduced a public transport act, expected to be enacted in November 2008, that will \nregulate fares to prevent market abuses. While the FSS will be implemented in accordance with \ncontractual arrangements, MID will have the ability to review, monitor, and modify aspects of the \nscheme to achieve optimum efficiency and accountability.  \n \n42.  Under the sector project modality, subprojects for both components will be prioritized \nand selected in accordance with the process and eligibility criteria in Appendix 7. A systematic \nand  consultative  approach  will  be  established  for  subproject  appraisal,  covering  (i)  social, \neconomic, and environmental evaluation; (ii) design; (iii) procurement; (iv) implementation; and \n(v) monitoring. Each subproject feasibility study will provide sufficient evidence of its eligibility \nunder the agreed criteria to enable ADB to assess the viability and suitability of the subproject. \nNo subproject categorized as category A in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) \nor Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) will be financed under the Project.   \n \nC.  Special Features \n43.  Geographic  Targeting.  Remote  communities  without  reliable  maritime  services  are \namong the poorest areas of Solomon Islands. Rural populations have a higher incidence of \npoverty, lower agricultural productivity, lower life expectancy at birth, higher percentage of \nunderweight children, lower levels of literacy and educational attainment, less access to safe \nwater and sanitation, and less access to health services than those in provincial centers. These \nindicators are in part due to constraints in access to transport services. Improved services can \ncatalyze growth and have a disproportionate impact on poverty.  \n \n44.  Private Sector Development. Creation of an FSS and provision of targeted subsidies \nfor services to commercially unviable destinations is expected to have a catalytic effect on both \nprivate sector ship operators and rural agricultural producers. By providing reliable scheduled \nservices, producers should increase their output and lose less of it to spoilage. Increased \ndemand for cargo and passenger services should in turn make rural routes commercially viable \nover time, providing opportunities for private sector participation.  \n \n                                                 \n14 The justification for subsidies is in Supplementary Appendix C. Operation of the FSS is described in Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n15 Legislative reforms are being pursued through the ongoing preparatory TA (footnote 8). \n ", "9 \n45.  Output-Based Approach. Under the output-based approach, subsidies will be tied to \nperformance based on specifications for destination, frequency, and passengers and cargo \ncarried. Franchise contracts will require certification from communities at target destinations that \nperformance indicators have been met. This will create clear incentives to increase and improve \nservices, while providing a safety net for operators until routes become commercially viable.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n46.  The project investment cost is estimated at $21.40 million as shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.  Base Costb   \n  1.

Price contingencies computed at 7.5%; includes provision for potential exchange rate \nfluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \ne  Includes  management  fee  of  2%  of  European  Commission  funds  charged  by  ADB  for  administering \ncofinancing. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n47.  The Government has requested a grant of $14.0 million from the Asian Development \nFund to help finance the Project. The Government of Solomon Islands will provide $2.15 million \nas its counterpart contribution. The EC will provide grant cofinancing of $5.25 million equivalent, \nto be administered by ADB. As requested by the cofinancier, the EC funds will be front-loaded \nat the contract commitment level up to the maximum allocated amount of EC financing in \nindividual categories. The financing plan is in Appendix 4, and summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  14.00  65.40 \nEuropean Commission  5.25  24.60 \nGovernment of Solomon Islands  2.15  10.00 \n  Total  21.40  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "10 \nF.  Cofinancing \n48.  ADB\u2019s strategy in Solomon Islands emphasizes coordination with development partners \nand  encourages  cofinancing.  As  described  above,  the  EC  has  committed  to  provide  joint \ncofinancing. For the EC to participate, it requires nondiscrimination in procurement processes \nagainst  legal  persons,  firms,  and  goods  established  in  EC-recognized  official  candidate \ncountries,  member  states  of  the  European  Economic  Area,  and  developing  countries  as \nspecified by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development.16 Given that components of the Project are jointly cofinanced with \nEC, Management requests Board approval to allow procurement of eligible goods and services \nfrom countries eligible for procurement under EC regulations, which are not ADB member \ncountries. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n49.  The  EA  for  the  Project  will  be  MID.  The  Government  will  form  a  project  steering \ncommittee17 to oversee and monitor all aspects of project implementation, including (i) policy \nguidance and coordination, (ii) subproject feasibility study and selection, (iii) project progress \nreports and other project documentation, (iv) regular reports of FSS budgets and activities, and \n(v) audited accounts and financial statements.  \n \n50.  A project management unit (PMU), directed by the permanent secretary of MID, will be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation. Given MID\u2019s limited technical staff resources, a \nconsulting firm will be retained for these services. The PMU will be fully integrated with MID \nprofessional and technical staff as counterparts. The PMU will (i) conduct subproject baseline \nsurveys, feasibility documentation, design, and supervision; (ii) manage tender processes; (iii) \nmanage contracts; (iv) prepare withdrawal applications; (v) prepare project progress reports and \na project completion report; (vi) maintain project accounts and complete grant financial records \nfor auditing; (vii) monitor the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impacts; (vii) train MID staff and build their \nproject implementation capacity; and (viii) complete related project management activities, as \nnecessary to implement the Project successfully and comply with ADB policies and guidelines. \nDue to poorly developed capacity in MID as described in the financial management assessment \nin Supplementary Appendix I, the PMU will manage finances on behalf of MID. Outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 9. \n \n51.  Management of the FSS will be contracted to a professional management firm through \nnational  competitive  bidding.  The  firm  will  also  manage  procurement  of  services  as  a \nprocurement agent on behalf of MID. The management contract will be overseen by MID and \nsupported by implementation assistance provided by the PMU.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n52.  The Project will be implemented over 10 years. Civil works will be completed in 4 years, \nwhereas the FSS will be completed over 10 years. Both components will follow the same initial \nschedule as follows: detailed design, preparation of bidding documents, and tendering will start \n                                                 \n16  Regulation (EC) No. 2110/2005 of the European Council and Parliament, 14 December 2005. \n17 Chaired by the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Infrastructure Development; comprising members from the \nMinistries of Finance and Treasury, Development Planning and Aid Coordination, and Rural Development; and \nincluding representatives of ADB, the EC, and the Solomon Islands Chamber of Commerce. \n ", "11 \nin January 2009; award of contracts for civil works and franchises are expected by December \n2009; physical completion of civil works will be by 31 December 2012; completion of the FSS \nwill be by 31 December 2018; and grant closing will be by 30 June 2019. This time frame takes \ninto  account  appropriate  construction  periods  for  remote  locations.  The  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n3.  Procurement \n53.  All procurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Civil works will be divided into packages. International competitive \nbidding procedures will be used for civil works contracts of more than $1 million, as they require \nspecialized equipment and skills not available locally. National competitive bidding will be used \nfor civil works contracts and FSS contracts up to $1,000,000. International firms may tender for \ncontracts for FSS services under the same conditions that apply to national firms.18 Community \nparticipation contracts and goods and equipment valued up to $100,000 will be procured using \nthe  shopping  method.  All  tender  processes  will  include  measures\u2014including  clear \ndocumentation, public tender openings, and confidentiality of financial projections\u2014designed to \nprevent anti-competitive behavior.19 Technical and financial qualifications of contractors will be \nreviewed  during  bid  evaluation  for  post-qualification.  Before  the  contract  award,  the \nprocurement process and tender evaluation report will be subject to review and approval by \nADB.  Evaluation  of  international  competitive  bidding  contracts  may  include  a  margin  of \npreference for domestic contractors. The procurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n54.  Consulting services will be required to set up the PMU. All activities will be combined \ninto a single consultancy. The Project will fund approximately 94 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 164 person-months of national consulting services, provided by a firm. \nSpecialist services to be recruited and outline terms of reference are in Appendix 9. At the \nrequest of the Government, due to the EA\u2019s inexperience in recruiting firms and negotiating \ninternational contracts, ADB will select the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Consultant selection will be via \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  with  80:20  weighting  for  quality  and  cost \nrespectively. To accelerate implementation, ADB approved advance action for the procurement \nof services. The Government has been advised that approval of such advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n55.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project, and financial projections have been \nredacted  from  public  documents  as  explained  in  paragraph  53.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \n                                                 \n18 This may be achieved by registering a chartered vessel locally, by the operator establishing a domestic presence, \nor by partnering with a domestic firm. See Supplementary Appendix E for details. \n19 Financial projections related to potential subsidies under the FSS will be redacted from the public version of the \nfinancial analysis in Supplementary Appendix B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). \n ", "12 \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n56.  The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  direct \npayments and reimbursements. The EA will establish separate first-generation imprest accounts \nat the Central Bank for incoming transfers of ADB and EC funds, and two second-generation \nimprest accounts at a commercial bank for operational purposes. The accounting system will \nenable the PMU to process replenishments and liquidations separately according to funding \nsource. The maximum amount to be deposited to both first-generation imprest accounts will not \nexceed the total of $300,000 equivalent or the equivalent of 6 months estimated expenditures, \nwhichever is lower. Upon demonstration of acceptable financial management by the PMU and \nthe EA, the statement of expenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible \nexpenditures  and  liquidation  of  imprest  account  expenses,  and  is  applicable  to  individual \npayments not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000. Direct payments will be encouraged for civil \nworks and consulting services.  \n \n57.  Operation of the FSS will be through the imprest account. Payments will be based on \ncontracts established through competitive tenders and certification of outputs as described in \nSupplementary Appendix E. The Government will establish the NTF as a special fund pursuant \nto section 100 of the Constitution, to be managed in accordance with specific financial controls \nprovided by regulations made under its establishing act. The operational mechanism of the NTF \nand its terms and conditions will be defined during the first year of project implementation. Use \nof the NTF for project operations will be subject to review and approval by ADB.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n58.  Reports. The EA will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB on both components of \nthe Project. For component A, the reports will address (i) feasibility studies and preconstruction \nactivities, (ii) physical and financial progress, (ii) status of land acquisition and resettlement (if \nrequired), 20  (iii)  environmental  management,  and  (iv)  other  activities  critical  to  project \nimplementation. For component B, the reports will address (i) pre-tender activities including \nlegislative  and  regulatory  changes,  community  involvement,  willingness  and  ability  to  pay \nstudies, ship operator capacity building, tender document preparation and marketing of the \ntender; (ii) the national competitive tender process; and (iii) operation of the FSS, including \noperational and financial performance. To facilitate performance monitoring and post-project \nreview, the Government has agreed to provide ADB, within 3 months of physical completion of \nthe Project, a completion report that will cover implementation details, costs and benefits, and \nany other information that ADB might require. In coordination with the associated TA (paras. 62-\n65 and Appendix 10), the Government will advise ADB on progress in implementing institutional \nreforms, sector policy initiatives, regulatory reforms, cost recovery, and legal reforms. \n \n59.  Accounts and Audits. The EA will maintain separate records and accounts that will \nidentify the goods and services financed from the grant, the expenditures incurred for the \nProject,  and  the  use  of  counterpart  funds.  The  project  accounts  will  be  established  and \nmaintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  practices  that  will  follow \n                                                 \n20  As indicated in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy (Appendix 8), neither land acquisition nor \nresettlement is expected to be necessary.  \n ", "13 \ninternationally accepted accounting standards. The Government\u2019s Office of the Auditor General \nwill audit the accounts and annual financial statements annually. The audit reports will include \nan auditor\u2019s opinion on (i) the use of the grant proceeds, (ii) compliance with the financial \ncovenants included in the grant and project agreements, (iii) use of first-generation and second-\ngeneration  imprest  accounts,  and  (iv)  statements  of  expenditures  if  the  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  is  subsequently  approved  during  project  implementation.  The \nGovernment will provide ADB with the annual audited financial statements, audited project \naccounts, audit reports, management letters, and other related statements no later than 6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year throughout the implementation period.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n60.  The EA will establish a project performance and monitoring system within 6 months of \ngrant effectiveness. ADB and the Government, in consultation with the EC, will agree on a set of \nindicators for monitoring and evaluating project performance in achieving its goals and purposes. \nThese indicators will be refined and monitored during project implementation. The indicators will \ninclude  data  for  monitoring  economic  development,  sector  performance,  socioeconomic \ndevelopment, environmental impacts, maintenance, and institutional development. Monitoring \nand  evaluation  will  be  based  on  gender-disaggregated  data  for  social  and  poverty  impact \nindicators. The EA will monitor and evaluate the Project\u2019s progress annually, and provide a final \nreport within 6 months of the end of the contract period. \n \n9.  Project Review \n61.  ADB and the Government (with the EC invited to participate) will undertake regular \nreview missions (approximately every 6 months) and a midterm review (about 2 years after \nproject inception). The reviews will evaluate in detail the scope, implementation arrangements, \nand other aspects of the Project (including institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, \nenvironmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, and financial aspects) that \nmight affect project performance, viability, and achievement of scheduled targets. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n62.  Previous ADB TAs (footnote 8) confirmed the need to improve institutional effectiveness \nthrough capacity development and long-term support to improve the Government\u2019s capacity in \nmaritime administration and safety. The lack of institutional capacity causes deficiencies in \nmaritime infrastructure maintenance, safety, and administration. To comply with international \nstandards and protocols, it is necessary to strengthen (i) strategic planning for improvements to \nmaritime safety, (ii) adequate delegation of responsibility and authority, (iii) succession planning \nand a broad-based approach to skills development, and (iv) compliance with safety regulations. \n \n63.  The TA will reform the Marine Division into the new Solomon Islands Maritime Safety \nAdministration  (SIMSA).  The  improvement  of  maritime  administration  (vessel  registry, \ninspection, survey, and licensing of seafarers) and marine safety (search and rescue, navigation \naids, and environmental protection) will be brought together under SIMSA. Mandatory safety \nequipment will be purchased to upgrade the compliance of SIMSA and private sector vessels to \nmeet national and international standards. As a result, it is expected that SIMSA will become a \nprofessional and efficient agency able to effectively discharge its planning, asset management, \nsafety, and regulatory functions, as well as facilitate private sector participation by ensuring \nadequate sector governance and regulation. A detailed description of the TA is in Appendix 10. \n \n ", "14 \n64.  Through legislation, SIMSA will be vested with clear responsibility for the implementation \nand enforcement of all regulatory functions applying to the maritime sector. All provisions of the \nShipping Act 1998 and the proposed Maritime Reform Act 2008, as well as the implementation \nof all international maritime conventions and agreements applying in Solomon Islands, will \nbecome the responsibility of SIMSA. Training will be provided for government staff and private \nsector operators to improve regulation, inspection, and compliance. \n \n65.  ADB will provide TA to establish SIMSA and implement reforms. The total cost of the TA \nis $1.9 million. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program, which \nwill  contribute  $1.0  million,  and  will  be  jointly  cofinanced by  the  EC,  which  will  contribute \n$600,000.  As  requested  by  the  cofinancier,  EC  funds  will  be  front-loaded  at  the  contract \ncommitment level up to the maximum allocated amount of EC financing in individual categories. \nThe Government will contribute $325,000 equivalent in counterpart contributions through the \nprovision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space  and  administrative  support,  logistics,  and  local \ntransport. ADB will engage consulting services for the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants for the selection and engagement of international and national \nconsultants.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n66.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  the  rural  population  in  remote  areas  with  a  higher \naverage incidence of poverty through better access and decreased travel time to markets and \nsocial services. Government agencies and private sector companies that use the maritime \nnetwork to deliver products and services will benefit similarly. The estimated benefits to these \ngroups, as well as other impacts, assumptions, and risks, are described in this section.   \n \nA.  Economic Impacts \n67.  The direct benefits of reliable and safe maritime transport services will include travel time \nsavings, reduced cargo loss and spoilage of agricultural products, reduced vessel operating \ncosts and fuel use, and increased safety. Rehabilitated rural facilities will facilitate increased \ntransport services that will also be supported by the FSS. Reliable services will in turn promote \nmore agricultural production,21 facilitate marketing of rural output, and create local employment \nduring construction and maintenance. Improved maritime transport will also increase access to \nsocial services including education, health, and government functions.  \n \n68.  Economic benefits from transport cost savings will flow to the areas served. Benefits \nfrom lower freight transport costs will be divided between producers, consumers, and transport \noperators. Distribution analysis shows that, since market prices are unlikely to fall substantially, \nover 70% of such benefits accrue to producers. As most producers are rural smallholders, net \nbenefits to poor households comprise about 65% of total benefits.  \n \n69.  Economic evaluations of sample subprojects have been conducted, including economic \ninternal rates of return and sensitivity analysis, which show typical subprojects to be viable \nunder a range of conditions. For approval, feasibility studies will be required to demonstrate that \nsubprojects are economically justifiable, with economic internal rates of return of at least 12%. \nSubproject eligibility criteria are in Appendix 7. \n                                                 \n21 Experience in Solomon Islands shows that provincial copra production fell by 80%\u201390% over 2 years when \nsubsidized services were withdrawn in 2001. When regular services provided by the private sector resumed, copra \nproduction increased by 50% or more per year (from a very low base) to return to normal within 5 years.  \n ", "15 \n \n70.  Financial and economic evaluations of the FSS have been conducted. The financial \nanalysis shows that the FSS will result in the seven target routes reaching a break-even point of \ncommercial sustainability 3\u201310 years after project commencement, and that the FSS is the \nleast-cost option to providing services to remote areas. The economic analysis shows that all \nroutes of the FSS have a positive net present value over 20 years of about $1 million\u2013$4 million \nunder conservative assumptions.22 The financial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B and \nthe economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impact  \n71.  The Project is geographically targeted at the poorest areas of the country, and will \nreduce  poverty  by  improving  people\u2019s  access  to  domestic  and  international  markets  for \nagricultural commodities, thereby offering artisanal income-generation opportunities within the \ncommunity in place of large-scale commercial exploitation of natural resources. By reducing the \ncost and time of travel, inducing economic activities, and improving safety the Project will \nimprove people\u2019s incomes and food security.  \n \n72.  During the poverty and social analysis of the subprojects, the economic impacts of the \nProject on the poor and non poor will be assessed using secondary and field data. Distributional \nanalysis will not be needed unless the initial assessment is considered insufficient, and if the \nextra data collection and analysis required for distributional analysis is considered worthwhile. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 8, while a social and poverty \nimpact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n73.  Positive social impacts include improved access to government services and education \nfacilities, which will help raise school enrolment and retention rates, and improved access to \nhealth  services,  which  will  promote  more  frequent  use  and  facilitate  care  during  medical \nemergencies for those in rural areas who currently have no way to reach distant provincial \nhospitals. Other social benefits include easier access to administrative and service centers and \nimproved safety of passengers and crews at wharves. \n \n74.  Gender-Inclusive Development. Over 20% of the poorest households in rural areas \nare headed by women. Women\u2019s needs in relation to pregnancy, childbirth, and family care \nmean they are more vulnerable to the negative effects of living in remote rural areas where \naccess to health services and formal education are difficult. There is a strong likelihood that high \ninfant and maternal mortality rates in remote areas are directly the result of poor access to \nhealth services, and low enrolment rates among rural children\u2014particularly girls\u2014are attributed \nin part to the distance to schools. Improving shipping transport services will directly benefit rural \nwomen and their children in this regard. The Project will also be proactive in ensuring women\u2019s \ninvolvement in consultations, HIV/AIDS prevention, and impact monitoring.  \n \n75.  Public Health Issues. While the reported number of infections remains low, Solomon \nIslands is vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Risk factors include the prevalence of sexually transmitted \n                                                 \n22 Services will be provided by existing ships so no new investment is required. Internal rates of return cannot be \ncalculated for the routes since there is no initial capital outlay, but subsidy tenders will be designed to allow \noperators to structure bids to ensure positive cash flows and adequate financial rates of return. Net present values \nare positive at an assumed discount rate of 12%, well above the estimated weighted average cost of capital of \n7.15%. Sensitivity analyses show the results are robust in case actual costs and revenues vary from projections. \n ", "16 \ninfections, teenage pregnancy, gender inequality and violence against women, recent violent \nsocial  conflict,  and  cultural  and  religious  factors.  Transport  systems  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment are recognized as a vector for HIV transmission. Several HIV/AIDS prevention and \ntreatment programs and projects are active in the Pacific region and Solomon Islands. HIV/AIDS \neducation and prevention will be integrated into the Project through links to domestic and \nexternally funded projects and technical assistance. Construction contractors will be required to \nprovide their crew and communities with access to education and control programs. \n \n76.  Stakeholder  Participation  and  Consultation.  Initial  consultations  have  been  held \nduring  project  preparation  and  are  reported  in  the  sample  subproject  documentation  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. During implementation, as part of the poverty and social analysis of \nsubprojects,  consultations  will  be  undertaken  in  each  subproject  location  with  (i)  resource \nowners, (ii) households, (iii) the poor and non poor, (iv) females and males, (v) young and old, \n(vi)  the  disabled,  (vii)  community-based  and  nongovernment  organizations,  (viii)  transport \nservice providers and users, (ix) local contractors, and (x) provincial governments.  \n \n77.  Resettlement  and  Indigenous  People.  Subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require \nresettlement or land acquisition, as all works will be undertaken at the same locations as \nexisting facilities. If changes in conditions require land acquisition or resettlement for civil works, \nthe Government will inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws and \nregulations, the resettlement framework in Supplementary Appendix H, and ADB guidelines. \nNative Melanesians, who comprise the vast majority of the population, are the indigenous \npeople  of  Solomon  Islands.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  a  negative  impact  on \nindigenous peoples that would trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n78.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B,  as  subprojects  consist  of \nrehabilitation or reconstruction of existing wharves. Civil works are simple and will have only \ninsignificant environmental impacts. An initial environmental examination (IEE) incorporating an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) has been prepared for the sample subproject. An \nenvironmental assessment review procedure (EARP) has been prepared that will guide the \nenvironmental management of the Project and environmental assessment procedures for all \nsubprojects. Neither land acquisition nor resettlement is expected to be required. A summary \nIEE for civil works, prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003),  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F,  and  full  IEEs  of  two  sample  subprojects  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. ADB\u2019s assessment procedure is aligned with the environmental \nimpact assessment requirements of the Government\u2019s Environment Act (1998). \n \n79.  The typical environmental impacts of the subprojects include earthworks that may cause \nsedimentation of nearby water bodies, potential contamination from lubricating oil, sewage \ndischarge, dust and emission from machinery, and noise. Mitigation measures that will minimize \nthe impacts have been prescribed and will be implemented. Adherence to best engineering \npractices during rehabilitation, and strict enforcement of the EMP, will avoid or adequately \nmitigate all of the rehabilitation-related impacts. Subproject environmental selection criteria will \nensure that the Project will not harm any ecologically or culturally sensitive areas. \n \nE.  Policy and Institutional Improvements  \n80.  The Government\u2019s policy on rural transport is clear and closely supported by ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy.  Funding  arrangements  for  the  FSS  and  for  maintenance  of \n ", "17 \nmaritime infrastructure will enhance the Government\u2019s capacity to implement its existing policy \nthrough operation of the NTF. Establishment of an FSS utilizing a simple and efficient output-\nbased  approach  will  improve  policy  transparency  and  sustainability  in  maritime  transport. \nProject  implementation  assistance  will  strengthen  MID\u2019s  capacity  for  conducting  feasibility \nassessments,  design,  tendering,  supervision  of  construction,  and  maintenance,  as  well  as \nstrengthen the ability of the private sector to participate in service provision. \n \nF.  Project Risks and Safeguards  \n81.  Technical Risks. The effects of climate change could damage infrastructure if designs \nare inadequate. The Project will mitigate this risk by requiring conservative design assumptions \nregarding sea level rise and using improved materials. Underestimation of resource allocation, \nmaterial availability, and inadequate construction methods and equipment might cause delays \nand increase costs. The project design will mitigate these risks by (i) incorporating provisions in \ntender  documents  for  evidence  of  satisfactory  past  performance  in  similar  conditions;  (ii) \nrequiring  minimum  provision  of  physical  plant  at  mobilization,  detailed  quantification  of \nengineering risks, and adequate contingencies; and (iii) holding community consultations in \nadvance, with Government support, on subproject selection and access to resources.  \n \n82.  Financial Risks of Construction. Grant-financed budgetary allocations for the Project \ncould  be  inadequate  as  a  result  of  underestimated  construction  costs,  inflation  during \nimplementation, and the potential cost of defending construction claims lodged by contractors. \nTo mitigate these risks, the PMU will (i) estimate costs conservatively, (ii) prepare subprojects \nfor concurrent implementation, (iii) use strict and effective contract conditions to mitigate slow \ncontractor performance, and (iv) require a guarantee by the contractor for 1 year following civil \nworks  to  ensure  construction  quality.  Government  budgetary  allocations  for  restructuring, \nmaintenance,  and  counterpart  staff  could  be  inadequate  due  to  poor  national  financial \nmanagement.  Ongoing  programs  supported  by  development  partners  are  strengthening \nGovernment budgetary processes, financial management systems, and provincial governance, \nand will thus improve the environment for project implementation and institutional strengthening.  \n \n83.  Financial  Risks  of  the  Franchise  Shipping  Scheme.  Grant-financed  budgetary \nallocations for the Project could be inadequate as a result of a low number of bidders for the \nfranchise routes, resulting in a less than fully competitive bidding process. Bidders might apply a \nlarge discount to their bids because of past experience with slow payment for ad hoc charters. \nTo mitigate these risks, the PMU will employ a tender process designed to maximize bidder \ninvolvement, including training and workshops to help bidders complete the necessary bid \ndocuments,  including  financial  modeling  of  costs  and  revenues  to  assist  with  contract \nnegotiations.  Bidder  concerns  about  slow  payment  will  be  mitigated  by  establishing  a \nmanagement arrangement with clear payment processes, funding that is not dependent on \nannual budget appropriations, and straightforward payment terms in the franchise contract. Fare \nand cargo rate levels will be discussed prior to the tender with all stakeholders, in order to \nobtain recognition of the need for shipping operators to cover their costs. \n \n84.  Institutional Reforms and Sector Restructuring Risks. Development of management \nsystems for SIMSA depends on successful ADB TA and adequate Government funding. The \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  the  reform  process,  and  associated  development  and \nimplementation of operational and management procedures, could wane. Further risks include \nthe  Government  not  progressing  with  timely  legal  and  institutional  reforms,  and  resource \nshortages within MID. The project design mitigates these risks through close collaboration and \ncooperation via TA, which involves consultations between Government, the private sector, and \n ", "18 \nthe public. ADB project and TA review missions, as well as country consultation missions, will \nengage in regular dialogue to maintain support and commitment. ADB will also continue to work \nclosely with development partners to promote sector governance improvements.  \n \n85.  Land and Material Acquisition Risks. Landowners and rural populations are expected \nto welcome project activities for the social and economic benefits. Existing practice in Solomon \nIslands is for local landowners to grant access for aggregates as their counterpart contribution. \nClear  Government  and  development  partner  policies  regarding  counterpart  contributions \nmitigate the risk of demands for compensation. No land acquisition is expected. \n \n86.  Post-Conflict  Environment  Risks. The post-conflict environment is stable, and the \neconomy has recovered substantially. The business environment is increasingly positive, as \ncontractors and consultants respond to business opportunities. If political instability increases or \nthe peace and order situation deteriorates, prospective bidders might have less interest in the \nProject, increasing tender prices. This could also reduce community support for the Project. \nContinuing assistance by development partners that is both large in scope and long term, to \nhelp the Government with its economic and post-conflict recovery efforts, mitigates this risk. \n \n87.  Analysis of the risks shows the economic benefits are robust, and adverse social and \nenvironmental impacts to be insignificant and capable of mitigation. Cost and implementation \nrisks will be managed through the approach to contractor prequalification, contract conditions, \nfinancial incentives, and penalties to avoid late performance problems of previous projects. \nOverall, the risks are sufficiently manageable to not constitute barriers to project approval.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n88.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart contributions. The Government will ensure that its contributions to \nproject  costs  are  available  in  a  timely  fashion.  The  Government  will  ensure \ncounterpart staff for the Marine Division and the Transport Policy and Planning \nUnit are available throughout the project duration, and ensure that MID has \nadequate resources to support its routine operations, including per diem and \ntransport for staff participating in field activities.   \n(ii)  Subproject  selection.  Prior  to  the  detailed  design  of  any  subproject,  the \nGovernment will obtain ADB\u2019s concurrence on the inclusion of the subproject for \nfinancing under the Project. Each subproject will be prioritized and selected in \naccordance with the agreed process and eligibility criteria, through a systematic \nand consultative approach, covering (a) social, economic, and environmental \nevaluation; (b) design; (c) procurement; (d) implementation; and (e) monitoring. \nEach subproject feasibility study will provide sufficient evidence of its eligibility \nunder the agreed criteria to enable ADB to assess the viability and suitability of \nthe subproject. No subproject categorized as category A, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  or  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995), will be financed under the Project. \n(iii)  Franchise route selection and procurement. The Government will ensure that \nall  procurement  for  the  FSS  is  done  in  accordance  with  the  procedures \nsatisfactory to ADB. ADB shall have the right to refuse to finance contracts which \nhave not been tendered and/or  awarded in accordance with the  procedures \n ", "19 \nacceptable to ADB. Prior to making any change in the routes, vessel eligibility, or \nperformance criteria the Government will obtain ADB\u2019s concurrence. Prior to the \naward of any franchise contract, the Government will obtain ADB\u2019s concurrence \non the tender evaluation. \n(iv)  Land acquisition and resettlement. Subprojects are not expected to require \nresettlement or land acquisition, as all works will be undertaken at the same \nlocations as existing facilities. In the event of unforeseen land acquisition or \nresettlement needs, the Government will inform ADB and prepare a resettlement \nplan  according  to  relevant  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The PMU will ensure that no construction activities \nbegin until ADB has reviewed and approved such resettlement plan. \n(v)  National Transport Fund. Within 1 year of grant effectiveness, the Government \nwill  formally  establish  the  NTF  under  legislation,  appoint  trustees,  and \npromulgate regulations for its operation that are acceptable to ADB, including \ncriteria restricting the use of ADB funds and other development partners\u2019 funds \ndeposited  to  the  NTF  for  the  purposes  approved  in  respective  project \ndocumentation.  \n(vi)  Maritime Reform Act. Within 1 year of grant effectiveness, the Government will \nenact a Maritime Reform Act that establishes the Solomon Islands Maritime \nSafety  Administration  as  a  regulatory  body,  consolidates  and  updates  all \napplicable  laws,  and  provides  for  the  establishment  of  a  franchise  shipping \nscheme to be funded by the NTF. \n(vii)  Environment. The Government will ensure that (a) the Project is carried out in \naccordance with the project design, and construction and operations will comply \nwith  all  applicable  Government  environmental  laws  and  ADB's  Environment \nPolicy (2002); (b) the EARP will be followed including compliance of subprojects \nwith the operational principles indicated in the EARP; (c) the EMP is updated \nduring detailed design; (d) the environmental mitigation measures specified in the \nEMP are incorporated into the bidding documents and civil work contractor\u2019s \nspecifications;  (e)  civil  works  contractors  are  closely  supervised  to  ensure \ncompliance; (f) the PMU undertakes environmental monitoring and reflects the \nresults in the project progress reports and project completion report; (g) adequate \nsupport including training is provided to the MID officer assigned for supervising \nenvironmental management to enable environmental supervision and monitoring \nduring construction and operations; and (h) if necessary, an additional officer \nresponsible  for  environmental  management  is  recruited  to  supplement  the \nexisting environment management capacity of MID. \n(viii)  Labor  standards. The Government will ensure that (a) civil works contracts \nrequire  contractors  employed  under  the  project  to  incorporate  workplace \noccupational safety standards in accordance with all applicable labor laws and \ninternational  conventions,  (b)  contractors  provide  appropriate  training  and \ninformation for workers on HIV/AIDS prevention, (c) contractors and their workers \nobserve  local  customs  concerning  acceptable  behavior  towards  the  local \npopulation, (d) contractors pay equal wages to men and women for work of equal \nvalue, (e) specific clauses to implement this assurance are included in bidding \ndocuments,  and  (f)  compliance  is  strictly  monitored  during  project \nimplementation. \n ", "20 \n(ix)  Public consultations and participation. The Government will ensure that as \npart  of  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  of  subprojects,  consultations  are \nundertaken in each subproject location with (a) resource owners, (b) households, \n(c) the poor and non-poor, (d) women and men, (e) young and old, (f) the \ndisabled, (g) community-based and nongovernment organizations, (h) transport \nservice providers and users, (i) local contractors, and (j) provincial governments. \n(x)  Gender-inclusive  development.  The  Government  will  ensure  women\u2019s \ninvolvement in (a) consultations held under the Project, (b) HIV/AIDS prevention, \nand (c) project impact monitoring. \n(xi)  Project performance monitoring and evaluation. The Government will ensure \nthat within 6 months of grant effectiveness, the EA finalizes and adopts a project \nperformance and monitoring system acceptable to ADB, based on indicators and \nprocedures  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB  including  financial \nmonitoring of the FSS. The EA shall monitor the indicators according to the \nagreed  framework  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  determine  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of the Project, and shall provide to ADB semiannual monitoring \nreports  from  the  commencement  of  project  implementation  until  project \ncompletion, and thereafter on an annual basis for the first 5 years after project \ncompletion. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n89.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove \n(i)  the grant not exceeding $14,000,000 to Solomon Islands, from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, for the Domestic Maritime Support (Sector) Project, on terms \nand conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  from  the  European  Commission  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $5,250,000 to Solomon Islands for the Domestic \nMaritime Support (Sector) Project.  \n \n90.  I also recommend that the Board approve the expansion of procurement eligibility for the \nDomestic Maritime Support (Sector) Project and the technical assistance for Establishment of \nthe Solomon Islands Maritime Safety Administration to allow procurement of goods and services \nfrom those countries eligible for procurement under the European Commission regulations, \nwhich are not ADB member countries. \n \n \n \n \nC.

Maritime Network \n1.  Maritime transport in Solomon Islands is a vital component of the country's transport \nsector due to the lack of road alternatives on most islands. It also provides access between and \nwithin the six main islands and some of the smaller island groups. These shipping services are \nused for (i) passenger travel for social, educational, health, and commercial purposes; (ii) \ncommercial movement of goods from the outer islands to Honiara for both interprovincial trade \nand export; and (iii) the interisland importation of things such as consumer goods, building \nmaterials, and fuel.   \n \n2.  Throughout Solomon Islands there are designated international ports at Honiara, Noro, \nand Yandina (although Yandina no longer operates); approximately 86 small wharves and \njetties; and 26 anchorages. At present, there are about 60 buying points throughout the islands, \neach with a storage shed and a radio for the communication of ship schedules, and these allow \nproducers to prepare their cargo in a timely manner.  \n \n3.  Most wharves and jetties are in poor condition due to age and lack of maintenance. The \nassets are not appropriately maintained by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development (MID) \nunless provincial governments complain that there is a problem. This is a typical reactive \nmaintenance  approach.  Under  a  marine  infrastructure  project  executed  by  the  European \nCommission (EC), 14 wharves and jetties were constructed or rehabilitated; another 23 wharves \nand jetties were proposed for reconstruction in the National Transport Plan (NTP). Because of \nthe poor condition and the reactive approach, high maintenance costs are incurred. In addition, \nprofits  generated  by  ports  have  not  been  sufficient  to  cover  the  true  cost  of  capital,  and \naccumulated losses stand at about $1.5 million because of inadequate funding for operation and \nmaintenance. MID requires appropriate operation of the assets and records of asset use and \ncondition over time in order to justify their maintenance and/or rehabilitation and to sustain their \nasset operation.   \n \n4.  The larger islands are all within 400 nautical miles of Honiara. Connecting routes can be \ndivided into outer-interisland routes that are heavily exposed to wind and wave action and inner-\ninterisland routes that are more protected. Services are characterized by long distances from \nthe main centers and export gateways (such as international ports) to remote islands and the \nweather  coasts.  The  remote  areas  have  small  populations  and  therefore  low  passenger \nnumbers, which negatively affect the viability of services set up to communities in the areas. \nThe services are often forced by financial necessity to migrate to routes where there is sufficient \nvolume to provide or contribute to commercial viability. This may cause low trade volumes in the \nremote areas and trade imbalance between the high-volume areas and the remote areas.  \n \n5.  Remote communities in the Project areas lack reliable maritime services and are among \nthe poorest areas of Solomon Islands.1 The Project areas have a higher incidence of poverty, \nlower agricultural productivity, and greater constraints in access to transport services than the \nnational averages. Total demand for transport services in Ontong Java, Renbel, Sikaiana, and  \nTemotu represents 2.1% of passenger trips and 8.0% of cargo shipments out of the total \nnational demand. Except for Renbel, these outer islands are more than 400 nautical miles (741 \n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme. 2007.

Fiji. \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nkm) from the economic center through relatively unprotected waters, and hence require larger \nvessels with higher operating costs, which leads to lower service frequencies.  \n \nB.  Maritime Services \n6.  Interisland shipping services are operated by the private sector, church organizations, \nand by some provincial governments. The role of the private sector has progressively expanded \nand private operators are now dominant. In 2007, there were 21 active operators and other \nvessels in operation. The length of time that businesses have been in existence varied from 7 \nmonths  to  35  years.  All  are  servicing  the  provinces  out  of  Honiara.  Most  of  the  shipping \ncompanies operate a single vessel only and mainly serve routes close to Honiara due to the \ncomparatively high volumes of passengers and cargo available. These routes are commercially \nviable  without  government  assistance.  Meanwhile,  remote  provinces  are  seldom  serviced \nbecause  they  are  regarded  as  commercially  unviable.  Hence,  the  Marine  Division  of  MID \noccasionally charters vessels or space to cover assumed uneconomic routes. Also, the Marine \nDivision has been providing subsidies to some shipping operators to provide services in remote \nareas. The current method of subsidization involves the division determining both the route and \noperator for the service. The amount paid to the operator is supposed to be the cost of the \nuneconomic leg of the service less any revenue received from passenger or cargo fees. Service \noperators are required to provide log books to the division recording the revenue and passenger \nnumbers. Estimates of the current annual provision for this subsidy are $39,000 to $78,000.  \n \n7.  Generally, management expertise within the domestic shipping industry is very limited. \nManagement appears to vary from business to business and is weak in most of them, although \nthere are some exceptions. Most companies have computers and accounting packages but lack \nthorough knowledge about the system and require training. Thus, financial information is lacking \nin almost all of the companies, and they operate on a day-to-day basis. Their first priority is to \nensure the survival of their businesses; passenger safety and service quality are secondary. \nThe shipping operators require basic and advanced business management training.  \n \n8.  Many ships are old (the median age is about 20 years) and thus maintenance and \noperating expenses are high. Also, the high expenses oppress the costs for improving old ships. \nFuel and spare parts are said to be the major cost components of the shipping industry, despite \nthe lack of financial information.  \n \n9.  Fees and charges for the carriage of passengers and freight have not been regulated \nsince the cessation of operations of the government-owned fleet. Some provincial governments \nand provincial development authorities, which run many of the shipping companies, currently \napply restrictive licenses and license fees to other operators providing services to the province. \nAlthough the constitutionality of the fees is unclear, operators pay the fees (which are small \nrelative to the total costs of vessel operation) in order to keep their operation. Such licenses \ndiscourage the provision of quality shipping services, interisland trade, and development. Prices \nare set by the shipping operator and in general they reflect what the market is able to bear. The \ntotal price paid by a passenger or a cargo owner increases as trip distance increases, although \nthe rate per nautical mile declines as distance increases.  \n \nC.  Traffic Volume \n10.  The international ports of Honiara in Guadalcanal and Noro in Western Province account \nfor more than 80% of total port throughput (excluding logs) in Solomon Islands, with Honiara \nalone  accounting  for  more  than  two-thirds  of  the  total.  The  density  of  services  between \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nGuadalcanal and Malaita, and between Guadalcanal and Western Province, is very high, and at \nleast destinations in Malaita Province are commercially viable without government assistance.  \n \n11.  According to a European Union (EU) study of the sector,2 the annual interisland traffic \nvolumes of domestic passenger and cargo traffic were estimated at 231,000 passenger trips, \n96,000 tons (t) of general cargo, 25,000 t of copra, and 185,000 drums of petroleum products. \nThe percentage breakdowns of the interisland traffic by province are also drawn in the study. \nGiven the numbers, traffic in inner provinces (Malaita and Western Province) accounts for more \nthan  90%  of  the  country's  total.  The  outer  islands\u2014including  all  of  Renbel  and  Temotu \nprovinces and the islands of Ndai, Ontong Java, Sikaiana, and Shortlands\u2014are outside of \nprotected waters and, with the exception of Renbel Province, are more than 400 nautical miles \nfrom Honiara. For ships on outer island trips, sea conditions dictate larger vessels of 300\u2013500 \nGT (gross tons). While such vessels are safer at sea, their higher operating costs will inevitably \nlead to lower service frequencies. It is suggested that actual loadings are typically less than 100 \npassengers and/or less than 50 t (equivalent to approximately 500 bags of copra). For ships on \ninner interisland services, the ideal vessel size is 100\u2013300 GT; it is recommended that the \nactual  loading  is  typically  less  than  300  passengers  and  less  than  200  t  (equivalent  to \napproximately 2,000 bags of copra). \n \n12.  On some routes to major towns, alternative air services exist. The existence of air \nservices suggests population density and economic activity, which may also result in greater \ndemand  for  shipping  services.  It  can  be  assumed  that  on  these  routes  the  volumes  of \npassengers and cargo are highest and high load factors and frequent services will be common.   \n \n13.  Fiberglass or aluminum-hulled boats fitted with outboard motors are the most common \nmeans for passenger and cargo distribution and consolidation. Such boats are important to \nprovide the final leg in the supply chain to stores all over Solomon Islands, especially in selected \nbuying points in Central and Choiseul provinces. These points typically serve outlying islands \nsome distance from the distribution and consolidation centers.   \n \nD.  Safety \n14.  Deficiencies  in  maritime  safety  are  identified  with  respect  to  compliance  with \ninternational protocols such as training and ship inspections. Decrepit and unsafe ships ply the \nwaters because of lack of enforcement of regulations. According to the Shipping and Transport \nCollege,3 four ships were lost with 18 casualties from 1999 to 2002. Although compliance is \nimproving in general terms, an adequate plan is required to remedy defects and address human \nresource  issues.  Also,  environmental  matters  such  as  oil  pollution  are  not  covered  by  an \nadequate pollution response plan. Despite collection of oil pollution levies, there is little or no \nequipment for oil collection or dispersal. Lack of accurate charts and no electronic compatibility \nsuch as GPS (global positioning system) also reduces maritime safety. Finally, search and \nrescue services need resources in order to perform expected tasks. \n \n15.  Generally, effective management of maritime safety is difficult due to (i) insufficient and \nunpredictable  funding  due  to  dependence  on  the  annual  government  budget;  (ii)  conflicts \nbetween the need to keep vessels in service to operate vital shipping supply lines and the need \nto ensure the safety of crew, passengers, and the environment; (iii) a limited pool of appropriate \nexpertise; and (iv) inadequate systems vulnerable to cultural and political influences.  \n                                                 \n2 European Union. 1999. Solomon Islands Shipping and Marine Sector Study. Brussels: EU. \n3 Shipping and Transport College. 2003. Inter-island Shipping Project Mid-Term Review Final Report. Rotterdam: EU.  \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \n \n16.  Due to a lack of safety awareness, most shipping operators do not prioritize safety \nmeasures. On the administrative side, due to the inadequate and vulnerable systems, the \nMarine Division of MID has weak enforcement of rules in maritime transport, and thus low \npriority for safety measures. Safety training for shipping operators and the Marine Division staff \nis  required  to  improve  safety  awareness.  In  addition,  the  introduction  of  autonomous \nadministration that is not vulnerable to cultural and political influence is vital. \n \n17.  The fees currently collected from charges in Solomon Islands fall well short of the cost of \ndelivering maritime safety services. Typical annual revenue is about $32,500, while annual \ncosts  are  typically  about  $120,000  to  $200,000.  As  the  level  of  safety  services  currently \ndelivered  is  inadequate,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  the  costs  incurred  by  a  properly \nfunctioning maritime safety authority would be considerably higher. Due to the funding situation, \nproblems with services, expertise, and systems occur, resulting in ineffective management of \nmaritime safety.  \n \nE.  Institutional Framework  \n18.  Maritime sector responsibilities are shared between the Marine Division of MID, the \nSolomon Islands Port Authority (SIPA), and provincial governments. The Marine Division has \nimportant regulatory, policy setting, and sector leadership roles as follows: (i) provision and \nmaintenance of navigation aids, (ii) vessel safety and certification, (iii) vessel registration, (iv) \nofficer and crew registration, and (v) organization of search and rescue operations. SIPA is a \nstate-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Commerce, Industries, and Employment, and \noperates the two international ports (i.e., Honiara and Noro). Its main functions are to (i) design \nand construct appropriate port infrastructure, (ii) regulate port use through efficient and safe \nservice, (iii) provide pilotage and navigational aids, and (iv) facilitate government-regulated \nservice. Some provincial governments play a multiple role in the domestic shipping sector, such \nas  (i)  operating  interisland  shipping  services,  (ii)  providing  jetties  and  landings  used  by \ninterisland  vessels,  and  (iii)  applying  license  fees  to  operators  providing  services  to  the \nprovince.  \n \n19.  In the current structure of the Marine Division, an element that appears to be missing is \ncompliance  with  international  protocols  and  obligations.  According  to  the  Diagnostic \nAssessment of Interisland Transport,4 the current level of service in areas of maritime safety \nenforcement, aids to navigation, and hydrographic charting is below acceptable standards. \nSearch and rescue has apparently operated effectively, but without adequate systems and \nsupport. In each of these areas, there are international standards and protocols that should be \nmet or complied with, and responsibility for compliance in specific areas is not clearly defined. \nThe issue could be addressed by creating separate roles in the divisional structure.   \n \n20.  The importance of human resource development has been overlooked by the relevant \nministries (i.e., MID and Ministry of Education). There is an aging group of senior maritime \npersonnel\u2014including  marine  tutors,  marine  surveyors,  and  marine  administrators\u2014in  the \nSchool of Marine and Fisheries and the Marine Division of MID. Many of them are due for \nretirement. Hence, fostering the next generation is an urgent task for the Government.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004.

National Transport Plan. The Solomon Islands Government developed the NTP 2007\u2013\n2026 to provide vision, strategies, policies, and immediate priorities for development of the \nSolomon Islands transport system. The vision states the importance of \u201can effective transport \ninfrastructure  and  transport  services  to  support  sustained  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment in Solomon Islands.\u201d The NTP addresses a strategic framework and direction for \nachieving the Government\u2019s mission for the transport sector over 20 years by (i) developing \ntransport sector services, (ii) developing and maintaining transport sector physical infrastructure, \n(iii) improving the competency and capacity of the Government agencies, and (iv) developing \ntransport in the private sector.  \n \n22.  Transport Service and the Private Sector. The NTP strategy aims to provide regular, \nreliable, and cost-effective shipping services to all areas of the country. For maritime services, \nthe  Government  will  not  develop  shipping  services  but  will  support  private  operators  by \nproviding the infrastructure for the services to operate throughout the country. The means of \nproviding transport access for individual communities and localities will be based on providing \nthe most economically efficient and appropriate means of transport for the communities to \naccess services and markets for their produce.  \n \n23.  Physical  Infrastructure.  Maritime  transport  will  be  supported  and  augmented  by \nrehabilitated road infrastructure and air services infrastructure to provide an integrated national \ntransport system. Expenditure on transport sector infrastructure will be concentrated on the \nrehabilitation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. Also, maintenance funding will be \nincreased and kept at adequate levels to maintain infrastructure. To ensure adequate, timely, \nand consistent funding, the National Transport Fund will be established. \n \n24.  Institutional Environment. Government agencies involved in the transport sector will \nbe reorganized as regulatory agencies, and their service delivery functions will be outsourced to \nthe  private  sector.  The  Transport  Task  Force,  comprising  representatives  of  Government, \ntransport  users,  and  transport  service  providers,  will  continue  to  advise  on  key  issues, \ndevelopment options, and the prioritization of activities relating to the transport sector in general \nand the NTP in particular. The Government needs to monitor and evaluate plan performance to \n(i) ensure the appropriateness of the NTP in meeting Government policy and priorities for the \ntransport  sector,  and  (ii)  establish  the  effectiveness  of  the  NTP  in  meeting  the  intended \noutcomes. To monitor and evaluate NTP performance, MID will maintain a transport network \ndatabase, the Solomon Islands Transport Network Information System (SITNIS), which provides \ninformation on the country\u2019s transport system. SITNIS is expected to assist decision making for \nplanning, budgeting, and management of the transport network.  \n \n25.  Maritime Infrastructure. For prioritization of major wharf projects, in addition to the \neconomic viability criteria, the Government will apply criteria such as the social benefits of \nimproved access to health and welfare facilities, enhanced safety, and potential development \nbenefits.  To  minimize  subsequent  infrastructure  maintenance  costs,  the  Government  has \nadopted the policy of higher-quality reconstruction works rather than lower-cost works with \nshorter economic life span and higher maintenance costs. This policy makes it possible to \nreduce project cycle life costs, or whole-of-life costs, of the wharves. Surveys are required to \nprovide up-to-date information on the current and potential wharf and anchorage traffic. In \nconjunction with the traffic survey, the present state of all wharves must be confirmed. The data \nwill provide more accurate information to determine needs, priorities, and works programs for \nrehabilitation, new construction, or abandonment of wharves. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \n26.  To provide infrastructure to support shipping services, the Government will (i) provide \nthe necessary annual funding from the consolidated budget for the maintenance of wharves and \nnavigation aids; (ii) adopt assessment criteria for wharf construction based on economic viability \ntogether with social and development benefits; (iii) adopt a policy of higher-quality construction \nand  rehabilitation  works  to  improve  whole-of-life  costs  of  wharves;  (iv)  prepare  an  initial  \n10-year program of wharf rehabilitation and construction; (v) continue with the existing EU \nprogram  of  wharf  construction  and  navigation  aid  provision;  (vi)  utilize  funds  from  funding \nagencies, where available, for wharf rehabilitation and construction until Government funds are \navailable; (vii) conduct surveys to provide up-to-date information on the current and potential \nwharf  and  anchorage  traffic  and confirm  the  condition  of  all  wharves;  and  (viii)  retain  the \nSolomon Islands Ports Authority and its management of the three international ports: Honiara, \nNoro, and Yandina.   \n \n27.  Shipping Services. To assist in the development of regular, reliable, and cost-effective \nshipping services, the Government will (i) retain the system of the provision of shipping services \nby private operators; (ii) establish a system for providing financial assistance to private sector \nship owners to operate regular, frequent, and safe services to outer islands where commercial \nservices are not commercially viable; (iii) explore options for improving access to finance for \npurchase of more modern and appropriate vessels by private operators; (iv) seek funding \nagency assistance to provide training in appropriate small-business management and planning; \n(v) encourage improvements in the condition of vessels by amending relevant legislation and \nmore  rigorously  applying  regulations  relating  to  ship  seaworthiness;  and  (vi)  initiate  a \nconsultative process (jointly by MID and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury) to persuade \nprovincial authorities to abandon restrictive regulations and licensing arrangements.  \n \nG.  Main Challenges and Opportunities \n28.  The  most  difficult  challenge  for  the  Government  is  to  secure  funding  for  maritime \ntransport, including maintenance, rehabilitation, and operation of maritime infrastructure and the \nprovision of reliable, equal, and safe services in Solomon Islands.  \n \n29.  Hence, there are several issues, including (i) the establishment of a prioritization process \nbetween different transportation modes; (ii) the sustainable maintenance, rehabilitation, and \noperation process despite limited budgets, such as (a) the utilization of efficient maintenance, \nrehabilitation, and operation means; (b) the implementation of asset management systems; (c) \nthe incorporation of the systems into a budgeting process; and (d) the improvement of the \nexisting monitoring system; and (iii) the provision of reliable, safe, and economical maritime \ntransport to uneconomical remote areas.  \n \n30.  Another challenge is to introduce the new systems and processes addressed above into \nthe Government. Effective implementation processes and education are required to enforce \nregulation for the service provision in order to secure safe maritime transport. Many operators in \nthe private sector may be affected by the reinforcement. Hence, a strategic introduction built on \na careful discourse is required.   \n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE MARITIME SECTOR \n(1998\u20132008) \n \nFunding  Grant or  Description / Year of Approval  Amount \nAgency  TA No.  ($ million) \n \nADB  G-0078  Solomon Islands Emergency Assistance Project  4.95 \n(2007) \n \n  TA 4588  Implementation of Interisland Transport Reforms  0.50 \n(2005) \n \n  TA 4494  Institutional Strengthening of Ministry of Infrastructure  0.70 \nDevelopment (2004) \n \n  TA 4527  Diagnostic Assessment of Interisland Transport  0.35 \n(2004) \n \nEuropean  Grant  Solomon Islands Emergency Assistance Project  4.00 \nCommission  (2007) \n \n  Grant  Marine Infrastructure Project II (2005)  8.64 \n \n  Grant  Marine Infrastructure Project I (2003)  6.50 \n \n  Grant  Transport Sector Strategy (1998)  0.45 \n \nJapan  Grant  Construction of Market and Jetty in Auki (2007)  8.00 \n \nTotal      34.09 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance, \nSource: Ministry of Infrastructure Development, Government of Solomon Islands. \n \n ", " \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \n3\nTable A4.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category  0\n     Foreign  SLI$o cmailll ion  Total      Foreign  $ miLllioocna l   Total   % of T   otal                   A\nItem  Exchange Currency  Cost  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Base Cost  pp\ne\nA.

Project Components \n1.  The  Domestic  Maritime  Support  (Sector)  Project  will  consist  of  two  components: \ncomponent A will provide investments in rural wharves and jetties; component B will establish a \nfranchise shipping scheme (FSS) to support rural transport through an output-based approach. \nSubprojects  for  both  components  will  be  analyzed  and  approved  using  the  sector  project \nmodality.  \n \n2.  Component A of the Project will rehabilitate or construct about 12 provincial wharves, \nrepresenting a 5-year time slice of the rehabilitation projects in the Government\u2019s National \nTransport Plan (NTP). Wharves to be rehabilitated are mostly of simple concrete and timber \nconstruction with earth-filled causeway approaches and gabion-basket erosion protection. Most \nhave deteriorated to such an extent that it would be uneconomical to restore them to an \nacceptable and maintainable condition. In most cases, rehabilitation will require demolition of \nexisting facilities and construction of new pilings, decks, and causeways. \n \n3.  Component B of the Project will design and implement an FSS to award franchises for \nprovision  of  shipping services  to  remote  areas  that  are considered commercially  unviable. \nSeven routes have been identified as unviable and potentially eligible for subsidies to private \nsector operators. Service standards are described in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nB.  Subproject Eligibility Criteria for Component A \n4.  Subprojects will be subject to investigation and design criteria. Subproject selection and \napproval will be based on the following general eligibility criteria: \n(i)  The  subprojects  will  upgrade  or  rehabilitate  wharves  assessed  as  high \ndevelopment  priorities  based  on  their  contribution  to  the  objectives  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s Medium Term Development Strategy, particularly: \n(a)  potential  to  catalyze  development  in  remote  areas  with  poor  access, \nincluding  increased  agriculture  due  to  lower  freight  costs  and  more \nreliable access;  \n(b)  improved  accessibility  to  social  services  among  poor  and  rural \nhouseholds,  including  schools,  health  facilities,  and  Government \nextension services; \n(c)  increased  opportunities  for  employment,  income  generation,  and \nmarketing of local products; \n(d)  potential  for  increased  private  sector  participation  in  provincial  and \nnational economic activities; and  \n(e)  contribution to increased incomes and poverty reduction among poor and \nrural households. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  endorse  the  subprojects  through  their  inclusion  and \nprioritization in the NTP. \n(iii)  Communities will agree to use of land (for locations that are not public land) for \nrehabilitation or reconstruction works. \n ", "36  Appendix 7 \n5.  Environmental screening will be conducted for all subprojects. No subproject classified \nas category A in accordance with ADB's Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) will be \neligible for funding under the Project. In selecting subproject sites, including extraction sites for \nmaterials to be imported to the construction sites, the following environmental criteria will be \nused for the first level of screening. If any of these criteria are found applicable to the site, then \nthe subproject will not be approved as part of the Project: \n(i)  wharves in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive, and therefore \nin category A, requiring the production of an environmental impact assessment; \n(ii)  the need for major realignment of the existing facility; \n(iii)  significant loss or damage to near-shore marine environments, such as reefs, \nmangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n(iv)  permanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \n(v)  permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n \n6.  Screening  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  will  be  conducted  for  all \nsubprojects. No subproject that would entail significant involuntary resettlement, according to \nADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), will be eligible for funding under the Project.1 \n \nC.  Subproject Eligibility Criteria for Component B \n7.  Subprojects under this component will consist of franchise awards for specific routes. \nSubproject selection and approval will be based on the following general eligibility criteria: \n(i)  Candidate routes will be analyzed and prioritized according to the approved \nmulti-criteria  assessment  procedure  incorporating  technical,  economic,  and \nsocial criteria. Criteria will include distance of the route, historically poor services \nwith  frequencies  of  less  than  monthly,  confirmation  through  community \nconsultations, and approval by the project steering committee. \n(ii)  Projections  of  demand  will  be  based  on  data  established  through  baseline \nsurveys, comparing the effects of regular and irregular services in the target \nareas.  Passenger  trip  forecasts  will  be  based  on  population,  number  of \nhouseholds, number of children and young people in secondary and tertiary \neducation for each ward in the franchise area, the number of government- and \nhealth-related trips, and social events. Cargo volume projections will be based on \nthe share of agricultural products generated in target areas. \n(iii)  Assessments will demonstrate financial viability through cash flow analysis and \ncomparison of the expected financial internal rate of return versus the weighted \naverage cost of capital, and economic viability through calculation of positive net \npresent value using an assumed discount rate of 12%.  \n                                                 \n1 Involuntary resettlement addresses social and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary and are caused \nby (i) acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on land as \na result of an ADB operation.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nSolomon Islands does not have a formal poverty reduction strategy, but the Government\u2019s recent Medium-Term \nDevelopment Strategy 2008\u20132010a places high priority on pro-poor development strategies aimed at revitalizing the \nrural economy. Poverty is defined as an inability for sustained self-sufficiency in terms of income, health, or nutrition, \nas well as \"poverty of opportunity\" through lack of access to basic social services.  \nImproved transportation has therefore been identified by the Government in its National Transport Plan (NTP) as a \npriority need for the estimated 84% of the population who live in rural areas. The NTP sets out a strategic framework \nto (i) develop transport services, (ii) develop and maintain physical infrastructure, (iii) improve the capacity of \nGovernment agencies, and (iv) develop the private sector. Maritime services and infrastructure are essential \nelements in the country\u2019s transport network and a prerequisite for supporting economic development and poverty \nreduction, as nearly 75% of the population does not have road access. \nImproved transportation is also a priority in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy,b which aims at rapid, pro-poor, and \nprivate-sector-led economic growth by providing transportation infrastructure and services, and strengthening the \nenabling environment for the private sector. Both aspects are addressed by the Project. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                  Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention\u2014Geographical Poverty Issues \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe lack of regular shipping services to remote areas depresses rural production of commodities and undermines \ndevelopment. Services are unreliable and infrequent, with remote areas served on average only four times a year. \nSuch communities cannot rely on shipping services for passenger travel or transport of cargo, and consequently \ndemand is low. This has a negative impact on agricultural production in these remote provinces as there are strong \nfinancial and logistical disincentives to marketing produce outside the immediate local vicinity. \nRemote communities in the project areas lack reliable maritime services and are among the poorest areas of \nSolomon Islands. The project areas have a higher incidence of poverty, lower agricultural productivity, and greater \nconstraints in access to transport services than the national averages. Improved services in project areas can \ntherefore have a disproportionate impact on poverty by catalyzing growth in poorer areas. \n2.  Design Features \nImprovements to domestic shipping services to remote areas are expected to transform local economies by \nproviding opportunities to market copra, cocoa, marine products, and timber domestically and internationally, as well \nas to market smallholder produce such as betel nut, fish, fruit, and vegetables at larger, more profitable regional \nmarkets. This will stimulate increased local production of higher-value products, leading to increased household \nincome and a high positive impact on poorer households. These opportunities will in turn generate demand for \nshipping services. Reliable and frequent shipping services to the outer islands will also improve people\u2019s access to \nemployment and other income-earning opportunities, and contribute significantly to the health and wellbeing of \npeople living in remote areas by enabling access to education, health care, public services, and social events.  \nIncreased frequency of shipping services, together with rehabilitated infrastructure at some key ports, will attract \nhigher flows of traffic into and out of these centers, encouraging the development of small local markets and retail \noutlets, particularly near wharves. This will offer opportunities for local people, especially women, to generate \nadditional income through the sale of food and other produce to passengers. \n ", "Appendix 8  39 \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nStakeholders  in  the  Project  include  the  Government,  the  Ministry  for  Infrastructure  Development,  provincial \ngovernments, vessel owners and operators, business owners and operators dependent on interisland shipping, \npassengers, and other transport users. Those whose primary purpose is to transport cargo potentially include \nagriculturalists (producers of cash crops such as cocoa, copra, marine precuts, and timber), subsistence farmers, \nfishers, and traders. Passengers may include professional people such as teachers, medical staff, and health care \nworkers; government workers; and people with special needs such as women, children, the elderly, the disabled, and \nthose  in  need  of  medical  treatment.  Other  passengers  include  those  attending  social,  family,  religious,  and \nrecreational functions and sporting events, and tourists.  \nCommunities living in remote outer islands currently suffering from very inadequate shipping services will be the \nmain beneficiaries of more frequent, reliable services to be established under the proposed franchising scheme. \nThese communities were most concerned about the infrequency of shipping services and unpredictability of services, \nand expressed the view that this was a major contributing factor to the poor status of health and educational services \nand depressed economic status of these areas. The establishment of improved services was seen as a key to \nstimulating economic development by providing opportunities for marketing produce, and access to employment and \nservices, and enabling them to participate more effectively in economic and social life. \nFindings from community consultations in less-remote areas indicate that safety and poor conditions on board \nvessels were a major concern. Cost was also a concern, but many believed that a modest increase in fares would be \nacceptable  if the  quality  of  service  was  correspondingly  improved.  Respondents  also  identified  the  value  of \ncompetition as an incentive for ship owners and operators to improve the quality and frequency of service and to \nkeep passenger fares and cargo charges low. \nWith regard to improving maritime infrastructure, demand for reconstruction of wharves was high in the selected \nsubproject sites. The Project was expected to yield significant benefits and opportunities, including increasing \nincomes of local village households for both women and men. Economic benefits were perceived as the most \nimportant positive outcome resulting from the reconstruction of the wharves. At the individual household level, \ncommunity members envisaged opportunities to earn income arising from casual employment in the construction \nwork itself, together with opportunities to earn income from the sale of food and provision of lodgings to construction \nworkers. Once the wharves were in operation, women in particular were expected to benefit from the opportunity to \nsell food and other produce to passengers from ships berthed at the wharf, and the presence of the wharf was \nexpected to stimulate the establishment of local markets. \nIn addition to offering income-earning opportunities to villagers, the wharves were seen by community members as \nsupporting economic growth at a broader level. In Kaonasughu, for example, the fact that the wharf would be linked \ndirectly to the new road, including linking the village and surrounds with the main provincial market at Kirakira, was \nviewed as particularly positive, resulting in direct improvements to access to markets and thus leading to an increase \nin the production of cash crops. The presence of a wharf was seen by some community members as highly likely to \nencourage more ships to stop at that site, and thus would lead to greater traffic passing through the site to stimulate \neconomic growth and income-earning opportunities for local people. \nImproved access to boats and shipping resulting from the wharf was also seen as benefiting everyone travelling for \neducation and medical treatment. Due to long distances between home and school experienced by many secondary \nschool students, it is usual for students in many areas to board during the school year and go home only two or three \ntimes a year. The presence of a wharf was seen as directly benefiting school students and teachers and was \nexpected to greatly facilitate the offloading of school supplies from ships.  \nBoarding ships from small boats by sick persons, the elderly and disabled, pregnant women, and those carrying \nyoung children is often difficult and treacherous, particularly in bad weather and rough seas. While no reports of \nserious injury were noted, respondents did observe that the current practice of using small vessels to board or \ndisembark from ships was unsafe and uncomfortable, especially given typically overcrowded conditions in the small \nvessels used to carry passengers between ship and shore. Respondents identified benefits resulting from the \npresence of the wharf in making boarding and disembarking much easier, quicker, and safer for all passengers. \n ", "40  Appendix 8 \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nField research began with initial consultations with primary stakeholders, including provincial government staff and \nofficials, teachers, health centre staff, chiefs and elders, and residents of the area near each proposed subproject \nsite. These initial consultations gauged the general community response to the proposed Project and explained the \nneed for further detailed surveys. These consultations were followed 2\u20134 weeks later by more detailed surveys, \nconducted through focus group discussions with women and men and interviews with key individual informants \nselected from the population living near or within catchment areas surrounding wharf sites. Participation in the focus \ngroup discussions represented 5%\u201320% of the estimated local community populations. Selection of individuals for \ninterview targeted equal numbers of women and men representing a wide range of different age groups and \nsocioeconomic, educational, employment, and occupational statuses. \nIn addition to the field research conducted at each subproject site, consultations were conducted with communities \nand individuals in Honiara who are from remote areas, focusing on the existing interisland shipping services to their \nhome provinces, their concerns and needs, and their perceptions of the social and economic impacts of improved \nshipping services on the lives of people living in their home provinces. \n \n2.

The participation strategy \nwill  outline  recommendations  for  ensuring  any  potential  land  disputes  are  dealt  with  appropriately  prior  to \nconstruction work and good relations are established with contracted construction workers. The engagement of \nfacilitators (either by the Project or construction contractor) will be recommended to assist in drawing up community \nagreements, negotiate terms of employment (if any) and sale of aggregate (if appropriate); raise awareness of \nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS and environmental protection; and reduce the potential for \nconflict between communities and construction teams. Agreements with communities on maintenance of wharves \nand access roads will also be drawn up with the assistance of facilitators.  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.

Rationale \n1.  Marine transport is a vital transportation mode for connecting the six main islands and \nsmaller island groups and remote communities where there is no road alternative. However, \nlack of Government capacity in maritime administration and safety is recognized.1 The lack of \ninstitutional capacity causes deficiencies in maritime infrastructure maintenance, safety, and \nadministration. To comply with international standards and protocols, it is necessary to improve \nthe Government\u2019s capacity. \n \n2.  There are institutional capacity constraints in the Marine Division of the Ministry of \nInfrastructure Development (MID), including lack of strategic direction and an incomplete and \noutdated regulatory environment. Without a clear strategic plan for improving maritime safety, \nthe effectiveness of the Marine Division is low. There are also issues including inadequate \ndelegation  of  responsibility  and  authority,  lack  of  succession  planning  and  a  broad-based \napproach to skills development, and lack of a coherent plan for improving compliance. Because \nof  ineffective  maritime  safety  management,  there  are  deficiencies  in  compliance  with \ninternational protocols. A solution to improve the condition of maritime infrastructure, service \nprovision, and safety, is reform of the Marine Division into the new Solomon Islands Maritime \nSafety Administration (SIMSA), which is urgently demanded. \n \nB.  Institutional Reform Strategy \n3.  The current structure of the Marine Division is shown in Figure A10.1. A critical element \nmissing from the structure is the area of compliance with international protocols and obligations. \nExternal reports have identified that the current level of service in areas such as maritime safety \nenforcement, aids to navigation, and flag state inspection and survey have been acceptable. \nSearch and rescue has apparently operated effectively, but without adequate systems and \nsupport. Responsibility for maritime charts has been with the Department of Lands and Survey \nwithin the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, which is not appropriate for this very specialized \nfunction. In each of these areas, there are international standards and protocols that should be \nmet or complied with, and responsibility for compliance in specific areas is not clearly defined.  \n \n4.  Reform of the Marine Division to establish responsibilities as shown in Figure A10.2 will \naddress the central issue of establishing clear responsibility for compliance with national and \ninternational  protocols  and  obligations,  and  provide  a  more  logical  structure  for  divisional \nresponsibilities. The structure will clearly identify the entity as a regulatory administration. Using \nthe proposed Maritime Reform Act to carry out the changes to the structure will give legislative \nsupport to the changes and give a clear perception of the nature of the reform to industry and \nthe community. It will also assist in aligning SIMSA with similar entities elsewhere in the region, \nand allow the replacement of some archaic legislation relating to titles, fees, etc. Importantly, the \nnew status of the entity as an administration, whilst still within the purview of MID, will limit the \npotential for political interference through its clearly defined regulatory role. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

The technical assistance (TA) will rationalize the tasks belonging to MID and SIMSA as \npart of the institutional reform. There are four main tasks in the maritime sector: (i) infrastructure \nmanagement including maintenance and rehabilitation; (ii) shipping service provision utilizing \nchartering;  (iii)  safety  including  search  and  rescue,  navigation  aids,  and  environmental \nprotection; and (iv) regulation including registration, survey, and licensing. Currently, MID is in \ncharge of all tasks with limited capacity. Once the institutional reform is accomplished, the tasks \nwill  be  divided  between  MID  and  SIMSA.  MID  will  be  in  charge  of  the  infrastructure \nmanagement and the service provision through the FSS; SIMSA will provide operational and \nregulatory  oversight  of  safety.  SIMSA  may  also  be  involved  in  operation  with  respect  to \nmonitoring  of  the  infrastructure  and  service  provision,  as  it  can  obtain  reports  regarding \ninfrastructure condition and shipping services from operators. This separation will strengthen the \ncapacities  of  marine  transport  authorities  through  clearer  definition  of  responsibilities.  In \naddition, SIMSA will be free from the task of chartering shipping for commercial purposes.  \n \nC.  Impact and Outcomes \n6.  The impact of the TA is frequent, reliable, and safe marine transport. The TA outputs will \ninclude enhancing the capacity of SIMSA to implement the Shipping Act 1998, the proposed \nMaritime Reform Act 2008, and other maritime laws and international convention obligations. It \nwill do so by reforming the Marine Division of MID into SIMSA. The establishment of the \nmaritime authority is expected to improve administration of vessel registry, inspection, survey, \nand the licensing and certification of seafarers, and improve regulation and oversight of marine \nsafety such as search and rescue, navigation aids, and environmental protection. The TA will \nconsist of three main components as follows: \n \n1.  Component 1: SIMSA Establishment and Support Component \n \n7.  This component shall support the establishment of SIMSA and facilitate its transition \nfrom the Marine Division. Its outputs shall be the preparation of a human resources structure \nand  a  staff  development  plan,  a  review  of  shipping  fees  and  a  revised  fee  structure, \nimprovements to the maintenance of the Register of Vessels and to SIMSA\u2019s processes for \nregistering  maritime  liens  and  mortgages,  and  increased  access  to  and  understanding  of \napplicable maritime laws and conventions, and management of compliance. \n \n2.  Component 2: Safety and Operations Component \n \n8.  This component shall enhance the safety of shipping and port operations within Solomon \nIslands. Its outputs shall be the development of a search and rescue operations plan, new \nregulatory  arrangements  applying  to  navigational  aids  and  to  small  craft,  and  improved \nprocedures and increased capacity to undertake the inspection and survey of vessels. \n \n3.  Component 3: Compliance and Enforcement Component \n \n9.  This component shall increase the capacity of SIMSA to enforce the laws under its \nresponsibility  and  to  achieve  compliance  with  the  obligations  arising  under  international \nmaritime conventions and agreements. Its outputs shall include new regulatory arrangements \napplying  to  marine  pollution  prevention  and  response  and  the  dumping  of  wastes  at  sea, \ncomprehensive  security  requirements  applying  to  ships  and  ports,  training  programs  for \nGovernment and industry in relation to legal and compliance issues, and training programs for \nSIMSA officers in relation to the enforcement of laws and the prosecution of offenders.  \n \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n \n \nD.
