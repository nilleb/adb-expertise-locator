INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support implementation of the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Integrated Trade Agenda (CITA) 2030 by \nenhancing the capacity of customs agencies and the CAREC Customs Cooperation Committee \n(CCC) to better respond to the rapidly evolving trade environment in CAREC countries and \nincreasing private sector demand for better services.1 In particular, the TA will help expand trade \nthrough adoption of more open trade policies, building customs-to-customs cooperation, and \nstrengthening  institutions  for  trade  through  increased  public\u2013private  sector  dialogue  and \ncooperation. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with CAREC long-term strategic priorities, where trade is a priority \noperational cluster, and with Asian Development Bank (ADB) corporate regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI) operational directions for 2016\u20132020.2 The TA builds on past ADB support and \nresponds to the CCC\u2019s new, emerging needs to help further reform, modernize national trade \nfacilitation environments, and strengthen intraregional trade among CAREC countries.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  CAREC  countries\u2019  national  development  strategies  focus  on  expanding  trade  and \nimproving competitiveness to unleash the untapped trade potential of the region, as seen in (i) \nUzbekistan\u2019s recent opening up and (ii) reforms to support economic diversification, particularly \nexport diversification, by expanding trade in non-energy and resource-intensive sectors. Yet in \n2018,  CAREC  countries\u2019  global  trade  share  remained  at  less  than  1%,4 and  the  lack  of \nintraregional trade, investment, and movement of people made it among the least integrated \nregions in Asia and the Pacific.5 Trade costs are high in the CAREC region: documentary \ncompliance cost an average of $190 for export and $275 for import in 2019;6 and significant border \ndelays yielded an average border-crossing time of 16.7 hours in 2018.7 In 2018, 8 of the 11 \nCAREC countries ranked in the bottom half of the World Bank\u2019s logistics performance index.8  \n \n \n1  The CAREC Program is a partnership of 11 countries\u2014Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan\u2014\nworking together to promote development through cooperation, leading to accelerated economic growth and poverty \nreduction. The CCC platform identifies and addresses issues of mutual concern for CAREC customs agencies and \nhelps achieve their respective modernization and reform agendas at national and regional levels.

CAREC customs agencies are vital players in increasing trade, improving competitiveness, \nand ensuring the smooth flow of goods and people across borders. Major challenges to the \nefficient rapid transport and transit of goods include inadequate border facilities; nontransparent, \ncomplex, and excessive procedures at border-crossing points; and weak coordination of border \nagencies at national and cross-border levels. CAREC countries should modernize physical \nborder-crossing  point  infrastructure  and  older  border-control  facilities,  which  cannot \naccommodate new transport and trading models (just-in-time manufacturing, vendor-managed \ninventory, and multimodal transport). Customs procedures often cannot keep up with increasingly \ncomplex trading rules and the tremendous increase in trade volume from increasing international \ne-commerce. \n \n5.  CAREC  customs\u2019  slow  adaptation  to  modern  technology  solutions  perpetuates \ncumbersome paper-based clearance procedures at the border instead of developing paperless \ntrade systems, in line with international best practice.9 Suboptimal uptake of single window \nsystems and business-to-customs and customs-to-customs data exchange systems prevents fast, \nefficient, and secure trade growth and potential use of blockchain processes. Outdated risk \nmanagement systems are not yet in line with international best practice and hinder efforts of the \neight CAREC World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries to meet their international \ncommitments under the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. The relatively low use of national \nauthorized economic operator (AEO) programs, often because of inadequate automated customs \nsystems and a lack of incentives for the private sector, makes border-crossing points more costly \nand time-consuming.10 Inefficient risk management systems are compounded by the region\u2019s \nunderdeveloped transit systems, which hinder member countries\u2019 ability to move cargo rapidly \nand securely and participate in global supply chains. Such factors especially challenge landlocked \ncountries.  Border  management  cooperation  has  developed  slowly,  often  because  of  the \ncomplexities of interagency coordination at national and regional levels, including agreement on \nmutual recognition arrangements to help customs provide better services to the private sector. \nGiven  the  prevailing  challenges,  healthy  customs-to-customs  and  business-to-customs \nrelationships cannot operate at optimal levels. \n \n6.  Previous ADB TA support has helped address bottlenecks to trade through focused \ninterventions, including support to the CCC, a dynamic catalyst in facilitating reform that has \nhelped reduce (i) delays caused by 100% physical inspection of goods and transit convoys, (ii) \nmanual and multiple submission of document requirements, and (iii) complex, nontransparent \nclearance procedures (footnote 3). CAREC customs have begun adopting international best \npractice to simplify procedures, introduce risk management, and minimize documentation through \nautomation. ADB TA has (i) introduced innovative customs\u2013private sector dialogue to identify \nground-level issues and foster partnerships and (ii) conducted scoping work for investment \nprojects that help CAREC governments improve physical infrastructure and build national single \nwindows at borders.11 Reforms require continued development, however, to ensure that rapid \ntechnology innovations do not diminish the benefits they have brought. \n \n \n9  UNESCAP. 2016.

The CCC coordinates \nwith the CAREC Federation of Carriers and Forwarders Associations, also developed under ADB-financed TA, and \noperational since 2009. CAREC Regional Improvement of Border Services (RIBS) projects are ongoing in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, to improve facilities at key border-crossing points and support \ndevelopment of national single windows. \n ", "      3      \n \n7.  At the 18th Meeting of the CCC (in June 2019 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan), CAREC customs \nagencies requested ADB to continue support for their trade facilitation modernization and reform \nefforts, in particular to (i) improve the capacity of customs to build a regulatory environment that \npromotes efficient, transparent, and modern customs to better serve the private sector; (ii) help \nmeet their obligations under the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement; (iii) implement improved \nregional transit procedures; (iv) intensify efforts to develop and implement effective AEO systems; \nand (v) help identify and prepare trade facilitation investment projects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: the trade and smooth flow of goods and \npeople across the CAREC region increased (footnote 2), and trade from increased market access \nexpanded (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: CAREC customs agencies and \nthe CCC providing better services to their clients.12  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Scoping  studies  with  actionable  recommendations  in  customs \ninfrastructure, facilities, use of technology, and logistics support prepared. The TA will \nsupport scoping studies at select border-crossing points to assess the adequacy of physical \ninfrastructure (including laboratory, inspection, and cargo handling facilities); use of information \nand communications technology (including the single window); and logistics support capacities to \nmeet international standards and client demand for quality border-crossing services; and to better \ninform  necessary  customs  reforms.  The  TA  will  assess  completed  and  ongoing  regional \nimprovement of border services (RIBS) projects to ensure lessons learned are applied to new \nRIBS investments.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Initiatives in modern customs technologies and best practice supported. \nThe TA will support digital transformation of customs technologies by promoting development of \ne-customs systems, paperless trade, and technology innovations to eliminate trade-hindering \npaper-based  procedures.  It  will  promote  use  of  modern  risk  management  systems  (AEO \nprograms)  in  more  CAREC  countries  and  encourage  emerging  AEO  programs  to  develop \npreliminary mutual recognition processes across borders. Participating countries will implement \nthe comprehensive, risk-based CAREC Advanced Transit System (CATS) to enhance supply \nchain security, help trade flow more smoothly, and reduce costs; CATS will be supported by a \ncustoms information common exchange to facilitate intra- and extra-regional trade.13 \n \n11.  Output 3: Customs capacity improved. The TA will help conduct technical skills training \nand adoption of measures to reduce delay at border-crossing points, such as expanded joint \ncustoms border control pilots and regular customs\u2013private sector dialogue. The TA will help \ndevelop business-to-customs and customs-to-customs electronic platforms and encourage study \nvisits and inter-subregional learning opportunities to optimize lessons learned from other customs\u2019 \nand private sector experience. The TA will enhance customs\u2019 capacity to better cope with \nincreasing  volumes  of  trade  (arising  from  e-commerce,  blockchain  application,  and  other \ntechnology innovations) and coordinate joint training on logistics management and coordinated \nborder management with border agencies and the private sector. The TA will draw on and \n \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 Asian Development Bank. 2019. CAREC Advanced Transit System. \n ", "4      \n \nstrengthen ADB\u2019s knowledge partnership for customs cooperation and trade facilitation activities \nwith development partners, including but not limited to the CAREC Institute, the United Nations\u2019 \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the World Customs Organization and \nits designated regional training centers such as Shanghai Customs College, and the WTO. \n \n12.  TA outputs reflect CCC priority areas of work and will help implement the CCC 2019\u20132021 \nwork plan, aligned with the CITA 2030 Rolling Strategic Action Plan, 2019\u20132021. The outputs will \nalso help the CCC (i) coordinate and maintain dialogue with other CAREC platforms and sectors, \nsuch as the Regional Trade Group, the CAREC Transport Coordinating Committee, and the \nCAREC Federation of Carrier and Forwarder Association and (ii) identify opportunities for future \ntrade-related investment projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,450,000, of which (i) $250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration (RCI) Fund;14 (ii) $500,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  Poverty  Reduction  and  Regional \nCooperation Fund and administered by ADB;15 and $700,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity (ARTCF) under the Regional \nCooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. The key \neligible expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  East  Asia  Department  (EARD)  will  implement, \nsupervise, and monitor activities, including procuring equipment, organizing workshops, and \nselecting and managing consultants and resource persons. EARD will manage output 1 of the \nKSTA together with Central and West Asia Transport and Communications division which will \nplay a leading role in identifying upstream investments in CWRD countries and translating these \ninto operations. EARD will work in coordination with the CAREC unit (Central and West Asia \nRegional  Department); ADB  resident missions;  existing  development partners (the  CAREC \nInstitute and Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative); and others, creating synergies among \nregional initiatives.16 ADB will coordinate implementation of the TA with ongoing regional TA \nefforts to enhance trade performance and ensure mutual complementarity of activities.17 EARD \nwill fully comply with monitoring and reporting of activities required under specific funding sources \nand hold regular consultations with funding sources. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in the table.    \n \n14  Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n15  The fund was originally named \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund\u201d in \nthe 2005 Board paper. \n16 The Government of the PRC and ADB established the program in 2012 to facilitate the exchange of development-\nrelated knowledge among ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n17 ADB. 2019.
