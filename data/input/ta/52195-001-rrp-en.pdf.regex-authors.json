THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant to Nepal for the Priority River Basins Flood Risk Management Project. \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Implementation Support \nfor the Priority River Basin Flood Risk Management Project, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve the resilience of communities to flooding in six river basins \n(para. 9) in the Terai region (Map).2 It is in line with Nepal\u2019s National Water Plan, 2002\u20132027 to \nreduce social and economic losses from water-induced disasters through blending structural \nand nonstructural measures.3 The project will protect agricultural land and households in priority \nareas from a 1-in-50-year return period flood by constructing flood embankments, spurs, and \noutlet structures. The local response to flooding will be strengthened through the installation of \nflood  forecasting  and  early  warning  systems  (FFEWS)  and  community-based  disaster  risk \nmanagement (CBDRM). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic context. Nepal\u2019s comparatively low level of development in South Asia and \ncomplex geography render the country vulnerable to climate change impacts and prone to \nnatural hazards.4 During the monsoon season (June\u2013September), Nepal receives 80% of the \ncountry\u2019s annual rainfall, resulting in widespread inundation in low-lying areas. Underlying flood \nrisk drivers include (i) increasing frequency and intensity of precipitation events and flooding in \nthe Terai region; (ii) unplanned population growth from the mountain and hill regions, drawn by \nproductive agricultural and commercial land; (iii) inadequate and deteriorated flood protection \ninfrastructure; and (iv) the inability of communities and local governments to anticipate for and \nquickly respond to flooding. With climate change, flooding events are expected to increase in \nintensity and frequency, and the associated increasing damage costs threaten the country\u2019s \neconomic development. Disasters disproportionally affect the poor and marginalized because \nthey occupy the most hazard-exposed areas, and this will undermine the country\u2019s progress \ntoward poverty reduction. This is compounded with the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \noutbreak as rural poor are the most vulnerable and less resilient to impacts to their livelihoods. \n \n4.  The Terai is particularly vulnerable to flood events, and damage from flooding in the \nregion can have a significant impact on the rest of the country, as it is Nepal\u2019s largest producer \nof agricultural produce. The region has only 17% of Nepal\u2019s total land area, but accounts for \n51% of the 2.64 million hectares (ha) of cultivable land. The total damage by the 2017 Terai \n \n1  Of  which  (i)  $500,000  will be  provided  by  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund (TASF  6) of the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and (ii) $750,000 will be provided by the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. \n2  The Terai region is a lowland region in southern Nepal. \n3  Government of Nepal, Water and Energy Commission Secretariat. 2002.

United Nations Development Program. 2018. Human Development Indices and Indicators: 2018 Statistical \nUpdate. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \nflood event was estimated at $584.70 million, almost 3% of Nepal\u2019s gross domestic product. The \nregion is witnessing significant male outward migration to urban areas and overseas in search \nof economic opportunities. This has led to a situation where women take additional primary \nresponsibilities, including flood response, in addition to household responsibilities.  \n \n5.  Flood  risk  management.  Several  government  agencies  are  involved  in  flood  risk \nmanagement.5 However, there are both structural and nonstructural challenges, such as lack of \nfinancial investment in construction and maintenance of flood protection assets; and limited \ntechnical  capacity  of  national  and  local  government  agencies  in  planning  and  prioritizing \ninfrastructure requested by communities. The Department of Water Resources and Irrigation \n(DWRI)  is  responsible  for  all  infrastructure  protection  works  for  water-induced  disasters. \nHowever, the DWRI does not have comprehensive flood risk mitigation planning, which results \nin nonoptimal construction of embankment works. Further, gaps in Nepal\u2019s hydrometeorological \nstations, operated by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), and a lack of flood \nforecasting models result in local communities and local governments having little or no warning \nof potential flooding events. Further, communities are not fully prepared for flooding because of \nlimited warnings of impending flood events.  \n6.  Policy framework. The government acknowledges the country\u2019s flooding challenges \nand has developed key policy directives and goals that seek to reduce the vulnerability of \ncommunities  by  increasing  their  adaptive  capacity  to  manage  flood  risks.  Specifically,  the \nNational Water Plan promotes risk reduction for severe flooding through improved infrastructure, \nfunctional water-induced disaster warning systems, integrated water resources management, \nand community-level disaster preparedness programs (footnote 3).6 The National Strategy for \nDisaster Risk Management supports the development of modern hydrometeorological and early \nwarning  systems.7  The  Constitution  of  Nepal  2015  and  the  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  and \nManagement Act 2017 establish the governance and administrative structure for disaster risk \nmanagement under the federal structure. At the local level, CBDRM committees are responsible \nfor engaging the whole community in disaster preparedness. At the municipality level, local \ndisaster  management  committees  provide  the  platform  to  effectively  implement  CBDRM \nactivities by providing the linkages between local and national risk mitigation measures. \n \n7.  ADB  experience  and  lessons.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting \nsimilar  flood  risk  management  projects  in  South  Asia,8  including  the  Bagmati  River  Basin \nImprovement  Project  in  Nepal,  which  incorporates  participatory  designs,  sustainable  asset \nmanagement systems, and high-level technology for FFEWSs.9 Key lessons learned that are \napplied in the project include: (i) incorporating sustainability of project assets in operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  arrangements,  (ii)  designs  that  consider  disaster  risks  and  climate \n \n5  Department of Water Resources and Irrigation, Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Ministry of Home \nAffairs, Ministry of Defence, and Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration. \n6  The plan includes evacuation plans, rehearsals and drills, and training with the formation of standing committees. \n7  Government  of  Nepal,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  2009.

Alignment with ADB priorities. The project supports the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 by (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iii) \npromoting rural development and food security; (iv) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity; and (v) accelerating progress in gender equality by promoting women\u2019s involvement in \nthe CBDRM activities.11 The project outputs also contribute to ADB\u2019s Operational Plan on water, \n2011\u20132020, and Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020.12 \n \n9.  Project area and COVID-19. The project will focus on flood risk management for six \npriority river basins (subprojects) in the Terai: West Rapti, Mawa Ratuwa, Lakhandei, Mohana \nKhutiya, East Rapti, and Bakraha.13 These river basins do not have effective flood protection \nembankments. From 1991 to 2014, these river basins experienced 199 floods that reportedly \naffected 143,486 people and caused 273 deaths and the destruction of 4,284 houses.The \ncommunities that will benefit from this project are those most impacted by this regular flooding. \nCOVID-19  has  negatively  impacted  the  Terai  region  with  border  restrictions  to  India  and \nmovement across districts controlled.  The majority of COVID cases in Nepal are located in the \nTerai region. Flooding will pose further risk through preventing travel and limiting people\u2019s travel \nand limiting people\u2019s ability to access essential items and services that help mitigate risks of \nCOVID-19. Public sector support is justified, as flood protection works are communal assets that \ndo not directly generate revenue. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: social and economic losses due to \nwater-induced disasters reduced (footnote 3). The project will have the following outcome: \nresilience of communities to flood risks of selected river basins in the Terai region improved.14 \n \n11.  Output 1: Flood protection infrastructure and maintenance system improved. The \nproject  will  reduce  direct  impacts  from  flooding  through  (i)  construction  of  flood  control \ninfrastructure (embankments, spurs, and outlet structures); (ii) planning and implementation of \nbioengineering  of  river  embankments  for  enhanced  flood  risk  management,  using  suitable \nvegetative methods to prevent soil erosion; and (iii) development of maintenance manuals and \nan asset management system for flood protection infrastructure.

Output  2:  Flood  forecasting  and  response  systems  enhanced.  The  project  will \nsupport the government and communities in flood-prone areas to improve early flood warning \nsystems  through  (i)  installing  about  40  rain  gauges  and  30  hydrometeorological  stations, \n(ii) developing about 5 FFEWS, and (iii) improving maintenance of FFEWS. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Flood  prevention  and  preparedness  capacity  improved.  This  will  be \ndelivered  by  (i)  undertaking  an  organizational  capacity  building  program  on  flood  risk \nmanagement and infrastructure planning for the DWRI and local governments (municipalities, \nvillage  municipalities  and  provincial  governments);  (ii)  developing  the  capacity  of  local \ncommunities on disaster preparedness; (iii) constructing about 48 flood shelters with gender-\nresponsive  features;  and  (iv)  developing  CBDRM  plans,  in  consultation  with  community \nstakeholders (including women) and in line with local development plans and budgets that \nintegrate disaster risk information.15 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s value addition was initiated by supporting the government\u2019s comprehensive study \nof 25 river basins in the Terai to identify the priority river areas through both flood hazard \nmapping  and  hydraulic modeling  of  whole river  systems (footnote  13).  The  project  design \nincludes international best practices for embankment designs, (ii) allowance for climate change \nand increased flood flows, and (iii) bioengineering and nature-based solutions. The project also \nbuilds upon two ADB TA projects: (i) Mainstreaming Climate Change Risk Management in \nDevelopment;  and  (ii)  Strengthening  Integrated  Flood  Risk  Management.16  The  project \ncomplements  the  initiatives  of  other  development  partners  supporting  Nepal\u2019s  flood  risk \nmanagement and FFEWS. The project closely aligns with the World Bank\u2019s Building Resilience \nto Climate Related Hazards project, which supports the DHM with institutional strengthening, \ncapacity building, modernization of the observation networks and forecasting, and enhancement \nof the service delivery system.17 \nD.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n20.  ADB will provide transaction TA for the Implementation Support for the Priority River \nBasin Flood Risk Management Project.21 The TA will support all three outputs and provide (i) \ninstitutional  capacity  building  to  the  DWRI  and  local  governments  on  integrated  flood  risk \nmanagement; (ii) support for the development of an embankment asset monitoring system and \ncapacity  building  on  O&M,  and  the  defining  of  roles  and  responsibilities  with  respect  to \nfinancing, provision, and oversight at the federal, provincial, and local levels;22 and (iii) support \nto the DHM to develop the FFEWS. The TA is proposed to be attached rather than under the \nloan  to  better  integrate  international  expertise  and  best  practices  into  DHM  and  DWRI \noperations, leveraging ADB\u2019s experience in other similar TA projects (footnote 16). ADB will \nrecruit an international consulting firm in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time) to carry out the TA activities. \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.315 million, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and (ii) $750,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form \nof counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, domestic transportation, and other \nin-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  Technical  due  diligence  included  hydrology,  hydraulics,  and  river  morphology \nassessments of the six subprojects. Feasibility studies were guided by the flood risk hazard \nmapping prepared under the prefeasibility study (footnote 13). The priority areas were identified \nthrough computer modeling incorporating climate change combined with field observations. \nDetailed designs were completed for Mawa Ratuwa and Mohanna Khutiya for project readiness. \n \n23.  Structural interventions include embankments, gabion riverbank and bed protection, and \nriver-training spurs to protect adjacent areas from erosion and flooding. The project design \nfocuses on promoting sustainability, environment-friendly bioengineering, adaptability, and low-\ncost solutions, and uses locally available materials and similar designs to the current DWRI \napproach. This allows for relatively simple maintenance that communities and the government \ncan manage. The project will prepare O&M manuals and an asset management system to \npromote sustainability  of the  investment.  Climate  adaptation measures  are  included  in  the \n \n21 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 The TA will help (i) develop and disseminate O&M manuals; (ii) provide training in estimating required maintenance \nneeds and preparation of sufficient budget requests; and (iii) develop an up-to-date fixed-asset register with \ninformation on the asset location, condition, annual maintenance needs, and past maintenance history. \n ", "8 \ndesigns, such as provision for increased flows in waterways based on climate change models, \nand the adaptability of embankments that can be raised in the future. \n \n24.  The proposed FFEWS will be compatible with the DHM\u2019s system. Telemetry rain gauges \nand hydrometric stations will be installed in the project subbasins, from which the data will be \nused  in  the  hydrological  and  hydrodynamic  flood  inundation  models  developed  under  the \nproject. The models will then alert the DHM to provide early warnings via mass short messaging \nservice through agreements with local telecommunications providers. Similarly, the CBDRM \nplanning will follow the frameworks set out in the government\u2019s Disaster Risk Reduction and \nManagement Act 2017 utilizing local disaster management committees (para. 6). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Economic analysis. Economic and financial analyses were conducted for the proposed \nsubprojects and entire project. The economic costs include direct investment costs, O&M costs, \nassociated capacity building, and project management costs. Quantified benefits come from the \navoided losses (i.e., the damage no longer incurred by flooding) accruing with implementation of \nthe flood protection measures. These benefits include avoided losses from (i) damage and \ndestruction  of  buildings  and  public  infrastructure;  (ii)  damage  to  household  contents; \n(iii) damage to crops; (iv) loss of livestock; and (v) funeral costs and medical care costs of \ninjured people. Quantified benefits also account for continued population growth and increased \ninvestment within the flood protected beneficiary area and avoidance of temporary commodity \nprice increases during and immediately following flood events. The project\u2019s economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 9.05%. The subproject EIRRs are 9.01% for Mohana \nKhutiya, 15.24% for Bakraha and 17.96% for West Rapti, with the avoidance of losses to \ninfrastructure being the most significant benefits. The EIRRs for the East Rapti, Lakhandei and \nMawa Ratuwa subprojects were assessed to be below the 9% minimum threshold. However, \ntheir inclusion is justified to ensure a more equitable distribution of project benefits to highly \ndisadvantaged and poor communities. Implementing these subprojects will contribute to a sense \nof inclusion in national life as well as harmonious development of the economy in the Terai.24 \n \n26.  Sensitivity analysis indicates that the results are satisfactory against downside risks, \nincluding an increase in project capital costs, an increase in O&M costs, and a decline in project \nbenefits. The project will increase its economic viability even further if unquantifiable benefits, \nsuch as environmental improvements or reduced human mortality associated with flood events, \nare included in the analysis.25 \n \n27.  Financial sustainability. As the project will not generate revenue, the DHM and DWRI \nwill be responsible for maintaining the assets created under the project. Historic data suggests \nthat the DHM and DWRI may not be able to fully secure maintenance funds, and there is a risk \nthat the project assets will not last for their entire expected economic life. To mitigate this risk, \nthe project design includes the following measures: (i) embankment designs are simple and \nsimilar to government practices, (ii) the local communities and adjacent farmers will participate \nin embankment maintenance, (iii) the FFEWS contract includes a 4-year maintenance period, \nand (iv) the attached TA will improve asset management and build institutional capacity (para. \n20). The loan and grant agreements include covenants to ensure that adequate funds for \n \n24 Ensuring the project extends to marginalized groups, including the indigenous population, is important for political \ninclusivity, as the Terai has a history of political instability and violence. \n25 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nmaintenance will be provided to the DHM and DWRI throughout the estimated economic life of \nthe improved assets. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  The project supports the sustainability of infrastructure through a multipronged approach \ncomprising (i) an infrastructure asset management information system as a basis of sound \nmonitoring,  planning,  and  implementation  of  maintenance  and  adaptation;  (ii)  adoption  of \ncommunity contracting to support minor maintenance activities; and (iii) capacity building of the \nDHM, DWRI, and local governments to improve monitoring and maintenance activities. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  Financial management. A financial management assessment of the DHM and DWRI \nwas conducted according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of \nProjects.26  The  assessment  concluded  that  the  DHM  and  DWRI  have  adequate  financial \nmanagement  capability  to  (i)  record  the  required  financial  transactions,  (ii) provide  reliable \nannual financial statements and audit reports in a timely manner, and (iii) safeguard the financial \nassets. The assessment identified the following risks: (i) frequent project staff turnover in DWRI, \n(ii) the DHM lacks knowledge and experience with ADB procedures and systems, and (iii) weak \ninternal auditing in both DHM and DWRI. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management \nrisk is moderate. The identified risks will be mitigated by (i) assigning qualified account staff to \nthe project management unit (PMU) and project implementation unit, (ii) engaging a financial \nmanagement  consultant  to  support  project  implementation,  (iii) providing  training  in  ADB \nprocedures and systems, (iv) including comprehensive financial information in the quarterly \nproject progress reports, and (v) using ADB disbursement systems to reconcile the accounts. \nMoreover, the project will follow established practice and maintain separate books of accounts \nfollowing  the  government\u2019s  accounting  standards  under  the  cash  basis  of  accounting; \nadditionally, the project financial statements will be audited annually by the Office of the Auditor \nGeneral in accordance with International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions standards. \n \n30.  Procurement. All procurement and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the \nADB loan and grant will be carried out in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy and \nProcurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers.  While  Nepal\u2019s  procurement  risk  rating  is \nsubstantial,  the  implementing  agencies  are  experienced  in  implementing  ADB  and  other \nexternally  assisted  projects,  and  the  project  procurement  risks  are  moderate.  Mitigation \nmeasures  include:  (i)  engaging  an  experienced  procurement  specialist  under  the  project \nimplementation consultants (PIC); and (ii) the PIC providing on-the-job training in procurement \nand contract management to the DHM and DWRI, and assisting in developing a database to \nregularly update and monitor contract management plans. \n \n31.  Through strategic market analysis, the project has adopted standard bidding documents \nto encourage healthy competition and to align with government approval processes.27 Civil \nworks contracts will be awarded on a least-cost basis and abnormally low bids will be either \nrejected or performance guarantees increased. The turnkey FFEWS package will be procured \nas goods (under a supply, install, commission, operate, and maintain contract) contributing to \nachieving  value  for  money.

The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  Poverty. The project outputs will benefit poor and marginalized groups, as they are \nfrequently affected by flooding in the region. The project\u2019s poverty and social assessment \nhighlights that beneficiary households experience food insecurity (60%) and earn their livelihood \nfrom daily wage work, agricultural labor, construction work, or small businesses.28 Community \nconsultations, conducted as part of the poverty and social assessment, highlight that recurrent \nflooding affects farmland, crops, livestock, livelihoods, and property. Agricultural and residential \nlands frequently wash into rivers, causing landlessness and physical displacement. School \nroutines are disrupted during the monsoon season and families abandon land plots for fear of \nflooding, despite land being a critical livelihood asset. About 65% of the directly impacted \npopulation comprises people from marginalized ethnic or caste groups. With the economic \ndisruption caused by COVID-19, vulnerable individuals, particularly those who are just above \nthe poverty line, are likely to be pushed below the poverty line.  \n \n33.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project will \nsupport marginalized groups (including women), differently abled people, and caste and ethnic \nminorities  through  a  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan  (GESI-AP).29  During \npreparation, over 50 community consultations were held across the subproject areas. About \n30% of the 1,595 total participants were women and girls from diverse ethnic and caste groups. \nParticipants  expressed  that  women  are  disproportionately  impacted  by  flooding  events \ncompared with men. Women are greatly burdened during flooding events and post-disaster \nrecovery given their status as primary caregivers. In flood-prone areas, there is a need to \naddress women\u2019s preparedness, responsiveness, and post-flooding recovery. The GESI-AP will \nmainstream  a  gender-sensitive  and  socially  inclusive  approach to  all  project  activities.  For \nexample, the GESI-AP targets (i) at least 15% of construction laborers are women; (ii) all flood \nshelters and labor camps have adequate facilities (e.g., ramps, separate rooms for women, and \nseparate toilets); and (iii) CDBRM committees have at least 33% women members. GESI-AP \nactivities and implementing arrangements are detailed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nF.  Safeguards \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n35.  Environment (category B). Initial environmental examination (IEEs) were prepared for \nthe  six  river  basins  from  feasibility  studies  (para.  22),  although  the  East  Rapti  subproject \ninvolves  only  construction  of  flood  shelters  and  development  of  FFEWS.  The  IEEs  were \nprepared  following  the  national  environmental  provisions  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The IEEs include the environmental management plan (EMP), which identifies the \npotential environmental impacts and proposes mitigation measures,  a monitoring plan, and \noverall  safeguards  implementation  institutional  arrangements.  The  EMP  also  requires \noccupational health and safety measures for project staff and nearby communities, including \n \n28 Poverty  and  Social  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  social \nsafeguards due diligence involved more than 50 community consultations and 400 household surveys. \n29 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "11 \nmanaging the spread of COVID-19. The IEEs will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website based on the \nrequirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement and ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. \n \n36.  The  project  will  not  encroach  upon  national  parks  and  buffer  zones,  protected  or \nsensitive  ecosystems,  and  ancient  heritage  sites.  The  project\u2019s  key  activities  that  attract \nenvironmental concerns are construction of embankments, flood shelters, FFEWS, and quarry \noperation. The environmental impacts predicted during implementation are mainly restricted to \nthe  construction  stage  and  will  be  site  specific,  short  in  duration,  reversible,  and  of  low \nsignificance, such as temporary dust in the air, sediments in water, and noise pollution. \n \n37.  The DHM and DWRI have adequate capacity to manage the potential impacts, and the \nPIC  environmental  specialist  will  provide  additional  training to  DHM  and  DWRI.  The  PMU \nenvironmental officer will be responsible for addressing overall environmental concerns related \nto construction. The field offices will oversee the implementation of the IEEs\u2019 recommendations \nand  the  EMP,  assisted  by  the  PIC  environmental  specialist.  All  contractors  will  have  an \nenvironmental specialist who will manage environmental impacts related to construction. The \nproject\u2019s  safeguards  performance  will  be  reported  through  quarterly  progress  reports  and \nsemiannual  environmental  compliance  monitoring  reports  during  construction,  and  annual \nmonitoring reports during O&M. Consultation with stakeholders and affected people was carried \nout during project preparation and will continue during implementation. The project grievance \nredress mechanism will resolve complaints in a timely and systematic manner. \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The social safeguards due diligence confirms \nthat there is no physical or economic displacement because of involuntary land acquisition or \ninvoluntary restriction on land use under the project.31 Project infrastructure is estimated to \nrequire (i) about 50 ha of land for construction of embankments (with a width of up to 12 meters) \nacross five river basins, (ii) 1.6 ha of land for construction of 48 community flood shelters (about \n340 square meters per flood shelter) across six river basins, and (iii) 0.02 ha of land for the 30 \nrain gauge stations (about five square meters per station). The project will satisfy land use \nrequirements through a combination of government land, negotiated settlement, and voluntary \nland contributions from direct project beneficiaries. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Most project beneficiaries are from ethnically distinct \nand  vulnerable  groups.  The  consultation  process  identified multiple ethnic  groups  that  are \nanticipated  to  benefit  from the  project  activities; these  groups  include  the  Bote,  Chepang, \nGurung, Magar, Madheshi, Newar, Rai, Tamang and Tharus. Consultations confirm that project \nactivities will not adversely affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, culture, territory, \nnatural, or cultural resources of indigenous peoples. As per Appendix 3, para. 17 of ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement, a separate indigenous peoples plan is not required, as indigenous \npeoples are the majority of direct project beneficiaries, and only positive impacts are identified. \nThe project design has mainstreamed a culturally sensitive approach to information sharing, \nmeaningful consultation, and benefit sharing. \n \nG.
