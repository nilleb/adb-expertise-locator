I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Bihar Power System Improvement Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Bihar  Power  Sector  Capacity  Development  and \nImplementation Support, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will upgrade the electric power system, increase efficiency, reliability and \nquality of supply through physical investments in the power infrastructure of the state of Bihar, \ncoupled with a capacity development component. Project investments include installation of \nnew, and renovation and modernization (R&M) of existing transmission substations; installation \nof  new,  and reinforcement  of existing transmission  lines;  and the  improving  of  distribution \nsystems in seven towns in Bihar. This will reduce system bottlenecks, boost power supply and \nsystem reliability, and minimize technical and commercial losses. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  India's annual economic growth rate of over 8% since 2008 has accelerated energy \nneeds.  Suffering  nationwide  from  peak  power  deficits  of  around  12%,  India  has  identified \ninfrastructure improvements and better electric power supply as a key feature of its drive to \nsustain high growth levels. Currently, only about 60% of Indian households have access to \nelectricity. Adequate supply is essential for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n4.  While India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing countries in the world, Bihar\u2014\nwith a population of 90 million and a per capita income of around $160\u2014remains one of its \npoorest states. One in seven of India's poor resides in Bihar, and about 40% of the population \nlives below the poverty line, compared with 23% nationally. Per capita consumption of electricity \nin Bihar was approximately 100 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per annum in FY2007,2 compared with a \nnational average of over 700 kWh. In FY2008, Bihar faced energy shortages of 28% and peak \npower shortages 16%. However, the true extent of unserved and suppressed demand is difficult \nto gauge as supply has been irregular for so long.  \n \n5.  Bihar's power sector is in need of investment. Insufficient capacity of its transmission \nnetwork restrains reliability, quality, and stability of power supply. Bihar's electricity distribution \nnetwork  has  failed  to  keep  pace  with  growing  demand.  Power  transformer  capacity  is \ninadequate to meet demand on 11 kilovolt (kV) feeders in many areas, 33 kV and 11 kV feeders \nare being loaded above thermal limits, and failure rates for distribution transformers are about \n19%. Undersized conductors, long low-voltage circuits, and overloaded distribution transformers \nfurther impair quality of supply. Overall, system losses exceed 40%. This is a considerable drag \non sector finances and sustainability.  \n \n6.  Though Bihar needs more generation capacity to begin closing the supply\u2013demand gap, \nboosting generation is a relatively low priority because Bihar is able to buy power from the \ncentral  generation  utilities  and  from  independent  generators.  Upgrading  transmission  and \ndistribution  systems,  and  reducing  system  losses,  is  thus  a first  and more  essential  step, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Planning and Development Department, Government of Bihar. 2009. Power Sector Report. Patna. ", "2 \nparticularly since adding generation will be more efficient and cost-effective once system losses \nare contained. The proposed project will address these concerns in four distribution circles \n(seven towns) within the state,3 and through two transmission system upgrade components.4 \nThe capacity development component will deal with constraints in managerial and engineering \npractices that have contributed to the high system losses. \n \n7.  Upgrading the transmission and distribution (T&D) systems is one of four power sector \npriorities in the Government of India's 11th Five Year Plan.5 This project is thus consistent with \nthe  government's  strategy,  and  the  India  country  partnership  and  strategy  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), which complements the government's strategy and specifies ADB \nsupport  of  energy  initiatives  in  India,  including  expanding  and  optimizing  T&D  systems, \nproviding institutional strengthening, and encouraging energy efficiency and conservation.6  \n \n8.  The  project  also  reflects  lessons  from  previous  ADB  interventions.  The  country \nassistance program evaluation,7 conducted in 2007, notes that ADB's sector performance is \nrated successful because most ADB assistance helped build much-needed infrastructure and \ncontributed to the improvement of sector policy and institutional environments. This evaluation \nstresses the need to stay focused on states that suffer from high poverty levels, low levels of \nsocial development, weak capacity and poor infrastructure. Also in 2007, a sector assistance \nprogram evaluation of India\u2019s energy sector identified the following main lessons: (i) ADB\u2019s \napproach to lending at the state level has worked well and should be used as a model for future \nassistance;  (ii)  sustained  technical  assistance  has  been  crucial  to  the  success  of  state \nprograms, both before and after loans were made; and (iii) corporatization via the introduction of \ncommercially and financially sustainable principles into state entities, and increasing the quality \nof governments can considerably improve efficiency and deliver better services to customers.8 \n \n9.  These experiences are reflected in the design and preparation of the project, as this is \nADB's first power sector intervention in Bihar\u2014a state with a high level of poverty and significant \nneeds  for  upgraded  electricity  infrastructure.  The  project  is  accompanied  by  TA  aimed  at \ncapacity  development  and  improvements  in  financial  management  and  governance. \nFurthermore, capacity-building efforts in the Bihar power sector have been ongoing for several \nyears to (i) prepare the project, including an existing technical assistance program analyzing the \nstate\u2019s power system and preparing a 10-year investment plan, and providing training for and \ncomputerization  of  system  planning;9 and  (ii)  to  train  key  executing  agency  staff  on  ADB \nprocurement and disbursement guidelines. Regarding improving sector policy and institutional \nenvironments, the Government of Bihar is in the process of planning the restructuring and \nunbundling  activities  of  the  Bihar  State  Electricity  Board  (BSEB)  in  accordance  with  the \nElectricity Act, 2003. \n \n                                                \n3  The remaining 12 distribution circles within Bihar are receiving investment funds through the Government of India's \nrural electrification program, Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana.  \n4  Central government funds via the Revised Accelerated Power Development and Reports Program will fund similar \ninvestments in the state's other 12 distribution circles.  \n5  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008.

The impact will be a more sustainable state power sector able to provide better services \nto end users. The outcome will be stronger T&D capacity, greater T&D system efficiency, and \nhigher quality and reliability of service in Bihar. Specifically, the investment components will \nfocus on seven towns within four of the 16 distribution circles in Bihar.10   \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  Outputs include T&D system components, and a capacity development component. \nTransmission component outputs include (i) transmission expansion via one new 220/132 kV \ngrid substation at Pusauli, (ii)  two new 132/33 kV substations, at Dhanha and Gangwara, \n(iii) erection of additional 132 kV bays at six existing substations, (iv) erection of additional \n220 kV bays at the Dehri substation, (v) erection of new 33 kV bays - 10 each at Gangwara and \nDhanha (both at the substation end and remote end), and (vi) approximately 368 kilometers \n(km) of new transmission lines (consisting of 33 kV, 132 kV, and 220 kV lines). Distribution \ncomponent  outputs  include  the  following  to  be  implemented  in  seven  towns  within  Bihar \n(footnote 10): (i) construction of 33/11 kV substations and R&M of existing 33/11 kV substations, \n(ii) construction of 33 kV, 11 kV and low-tension lines, and R&M of existing lines, (iii) installation \nof new distribution transformers and capacity augmentation and R&M of existing transformers, \nand  (iv)  installation  and/or  replacement  of  consumer  metering  equipment.  The  capacity \ndevelopment  component  is  designed  to  assist  the  executing  agency,  BSEB,  with  project \nimplementation support and construction supervision as this is its first loan from a multilateral \ndevelopment  institution.  This  component  also  includes  training  in  high-voltage  distribution \nsystems and will fund feasibility studies for a small project to pilot high-voltage distribution \nsystems,  as  well  as  other  training  programs  on  financial  management  and  corporate  and \nmanagerial planning.11  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $153.9 million. The government has requested a loan of \n$132.2 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be \ncapitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) \nan undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB. The investment plan is summarized in Table 1. \n                                                \n10  The seven towns are Bihar Sharif (located in Nalanda distribution circle), Motihari and Bettiah (Motihari distribution \ncircle), Samastipur and Begusarai (Samastipur distribution circle), and Ara and Buxar (Bhojpur distribution circle). \n11  Further details on the capacity development component are in the project administration manual (Appendix 2), and in \nthe Supplementary Document, Technical Assistance: Bihar Power Sector Capacity Development and Implementation \nSupport (Appendix 2).

The selected investment components have been subject to rigorous scrutiny. They were \nexamined  by  BSEB,  the  Ministry  of  Power,  and  the  Central  Electricity  Authority  of  the \nGovernment of India16 for their technical, economic, and financial feasibility. ADB staff also \nreviewed all aspects of the subprojects. ADB\u2019s loan processing missions visited sites, reviewed \nall  available  reports,  and  undertook  a  comprehensive  due  diligence  assessment,  including \n                                                \n13  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n14  ADB. 2009.

Best practice design standards and construction techniques will be applied. \n \nA.  Technical \n19.  ADB has reviewed and confirmed the technical viability. The transmission components \nto be financed by ADB are part of BSEB\u2019s transmission expansion plan. Development of the \nplan tends to follow an iterative process in which requirements for national grid offtake and \npower substation (33/11 kV) supply are matched, so as to determine the least-cost means of \ndeveloping the transmission network under a reasonable range of scenarios. In this sense, the \ntransmission  master  plan  is  the  least-cost  means  of  achieving  a  desired  set  of  electricity \ntransmission outcomes. Regarding the distribution system, there are no viable alternatives to \nsubstation and transformer modernization, line upgrades, and system metering. The proposed \ninvestment  components fit  in  with  the master plan  developed for the  state's  power  sector \n(footnote 9).17 Technical specifications and line diagrams for the proposed substations were \nreviewed, supply and installation costs analyzed, and technical loss reductions through some \ninvestments under the project quantified. Project designs will be (i) consistent with overall least-\ncost  expansion  plans;  (ii)  have  a  least-cost  basis;  and  (iii)  reflect  best-practice  design, \nconstruction,  and  operation  and maintenance features.  Investment  components  will feature \nperformance-based design consistent with international benchmarks for system efficiency and \noperating risk. The capacity development component will fund construction oversight services. \nFurthermore, the attached TA provides implementation support.   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  Economic analysis was undertaken for the investments under the loan. A time-slice \napproach was adopted for detailed economic cost\u2013benefit analysis, taking into consideration the \nentire T&D system investment program for the state (which includes the investment components \nfunded by the Bihar Power System Improvement Project), as detailed in the Bihar power system \nmaster plan. This was done to avoid the difficulties inherent in allocating costs and benefits to \nindividual components, given the poor condition of most of Bihar\u2019s electricity networks. The main \neconomic benefits of the proposed investments are incremental consumption, and displacement \nof  thermal  electricity  and  self-generation  from  diesel  plants.  Incremental  consumption  was \nvalued at consumers\u2019 estimated willingness to pay for it. Displaced thermal generation was \nvalued at estimated long-run, average incremental cost of power supply to Bihar, calculated \nfrom the generation part of the power system master plan. Displaced self-generation was valued \nat the variable cost of an average diesel generator. \n \n21.  A  \u2015with-project\u2016  and  \u2015without-project\u2016  approach  was  adopted  for  the  purposes  of \nanalysis.  It  was  assumed  that  in  the  without-project  case,  network  outages,  losses,  and \nunserved demand would increase in proportion to forecast demand. In the with-project case, it \nwas  assumed  that  outages,  losses,  and  unserved  demand  would  decrease  over  time  as \nnetwork constraints are relieved.18  \n \n22.  A period of 25 years has been used for economic evaluation, including 8 years for \ncapital investment and construction. Investment is assumed to take place in 2010\u20132017, and \n                                                \n17  The TA included analysis of the generation, transmission, and distribution systems in Bihar, including reviewing the \nproposed investments for the project.  \n18  For conservatism, the loss reduction trajectory assumed for the purposes of analysis was not as steep as that used \nin the power system master plan, with the latter assuming a halving of losses (as a percentage of net generation) \nover 9 years. \n ", "7 \nbenefits  are  assumed  to  be  realized  progressively  from  2011.  The  detailed  cost\u2013benefit \ncalculations  show  that  the  overall  power  system  master  plan  investment  program  is \neconomically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 26.5%.19  \n \n23.  Financial analysis of components to be funded from the proposed loan was carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.20 Incremental costs \nand  benefits  were  computed  based on  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios for  each \ncomponent. The costs include land acquisition, civil works, equipment, incremental operating \nand maintenance costs, and distribution cost. BSEB has limited energy and power metering \nwithin its network, with no practical means to isolate and measure the direct benefits of the \ninvestment components. Therefore, the annual revenue requirement approach was used to \ndetermine the financial benefits of the project components. This approach reflects the fact that \nBSEB will petition the Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission to have the new investments \nadded to BSEB\u2019s regulatory asset base at the next tariff redetermination, with the result that the \ncapital, operating, and replacement cost of the new assets will be included in the  annual \nrevenue requirement against which BSEB will be able to charge its customers. This approach to \ntariff setting ensures that BSEB is able to recover costs and earn a sufficient return on its equity, \nand provides an incentive to BSEB to invest in network expansion. \n \n24.  Incremental cash flows attributable to the proposed investments were estimated based \non the methodology and assumptions described above. The financial internal rates of return are \nestimated at 4.9% for the transmission component and at 7.6% for the distribution component. \nThese returns compare favorably with the estimated value of weighted average cost of capital of \n2.8%, substantiating the financial viability of the investments.21  \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  A governance assessment of the Bihar power sector was conducted, including public \nfinancial management, procurement activities, and anticorruption measures.  \n \n26.  Regarding  public financial  management,  BSEB  budgets  are  prepared  annually,  and \nfinancial targets for all significant activities are detailed enough to provide a meaningful tool for \nmonitoring subsequent performance. Actual expenditure is compared with budgeted targets, \nsignificant variations are reviewed, and corrective actions are taken. No major issues were \nobserved regarding BSEB\u2019s accounting and internal control. However, more computerization \ncould considerably simplify record keeping. BSEB recognizes that internal auditing plays an \nimportant role in ensuring good corporate governance and has internal audit functions in place. \nExternal auditors have raised no major accountability issues in their three most recent annual \nreports.  \n \n27.  The procurement and payment process will follow a cross-checking principle. Based on \nproject  requirements,  the  Store  and  Purchase  Department  requests  its  Central  Purchase \nCommittee, which is headed by the BSEB chair, to approve the procurement process of goods \nand spares. The Store and Purchase Department then carries out a competitive bidding process \nfor the procurement of goods. After the selection of the lowest bidder, the Central Purchase \nCommittee  compares  the  cost  of  the  goods  with  the  approved  budget  before  approving \nissuance of the purchase order. The Store and Purchase Department then issues the purchase \n                                                \n19  Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n20  ADB. 2005.

ADB  also  has  provided  support  to  BSEB  in  preparing  bidding  documents  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nincluding training and knowledge transfer of procurement matters. Furthermore, the capacity \ndevelopment component includes financial management training, computerization, and other \nplanning-improvement activities.  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BSEB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual.22 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  Adequate power supply is essential to sustain economic growth. Regular and efficient \npower supply is correlated to poverty reduction. Indian states like Punjab, Haryana, and Gujarat, \nwith high levels of power generation and consumption, also have lower poverty rates. Bihar is \none of the poorest states in India, with about 40% of the population classified as poor. Bihar \nalso has one of the lowest electrification rates in India: only 41% of villages have electricity \n(versus an 84% national average) and only about 10% of households (versus a 56% national \naverage). The project will cover seven districts: Bhojpur, Begusarai, West Chanparan, Buxar, \nEast Chanparan, Samastipur, and Nalanda. Agriculture is the primary economic activity in all \nthese areas, and access to reliable electricity supplies is wanting.  \n \n31.  The benefits of improving the power sector are manifold. Technical developments and \nreforms that lead to sector sustainability can free up resources for other pro-poor initiatives. \nGreater and more reliable power supply helps bolster social services as hospitals, schools, and \nother social entities often suffer most from patchy and low-quality power supply, and load \nshedding.  Socially,  efficient  power  supply  increases  access  to  electronic  media  such  as \ntelevision and radio, allowing better informed choices and greater understanding of civic affairs. \nDeveloping  Bihar\u2019s  power  sector  will  boost  farm  mechanization  and  agricultural  yield,  and \nbenefit  the  commercial  and  industrial  sectors  through  business  expansion  and  more \nemployment opportunities. Regular power supply will also shore up household activities and \ncottage industries. All these factors help reduce poverty. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  The project is classified under environment category B. Major components proposed \nunder this project are supply and installation of transmission substations and transmission lines, \nas well as distribution substations and distribution lines. The civil construction work is limited to \nbuilding foundations for the transmission towers, distribution poles, and substations. Project \nactivities are proposed mainly in major towns and will be carried out mainly on government-\nowned land. Some private land will be required for which resettlement plans in line with ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  are  developed  and  will  be  implemented.  No  forest  or \nsensitive areas such as national parks or wildlife sanctuaries are affected by project activities. \n                                                \n22  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nThe routes of the transmission and distribution lines will not cross such areas. Environmental \nissues identified are typical for the type of component construction, and a range of proven \nmitigation  strategies  exist  to  address  them.  There  are  adequate  budgetary  provisions  for \nimplementation of the environment management plan (EMP). The EMP is part of the bidding \ndocuments,  and  the  executing  agency  will  supervise  the  construction  contracts  and  EMP \nimplementation. Quarterly progress reports of its implementation will be submitted to ADB. In \nthe  event  of  any  change  of  alignment  of  the  transmission  lines  or  the  substations,  or \nidentification  of  any  unanticipated  environmental  impacts  during  the  course  of  project \nimplementation, the executing agency will revise the EMP accordingly. Initial environmental \nexaminations were prepared in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.23  \n \n33.  The  project  is  classified  under  involuntary  resettlement  category  B  and  indigenous \npeoples category C. Census surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance with \nADB's Safeguards Policy Statement. Construction of the three transmission substations will \nrequire acquisition of 4.1 hectares of privately owned land.24 The social census identified the \nresettlement impacts as insignificant,25 affecting nine households in project vicinity that will be \ncompensated for the loss of agricultural land.26 The construction of transmission lines will not \nrequire permanent land acquisition. Regarding gender issues, the loan agreements include a \nstandard assurance related to core labor standards for contractors (including equal pay for \nequal type of work), and an awareness program on HIV and sexually transmitted diseases and \nhuman trafficking.27  \n \n34.  As  this  project  will  be  the  first  externally  financed  project  for  BSEB,  the  project \nmanagement unit will need capacity development relating to safeguard compliance, monitoring, \nand management of environmental management and resettlement plans during implementation. \nRequisite  training  of  project  management  unit  staff  is  planned,  as  well  as  implementation \nsupport designed to transfer knowledge of implementation matters to the executing agency. \nDetails are included in the project administration manual.28 \n  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  A broad risk is that capacity constraints within BSEB\u2014including those related to financial \nmanagement,  governance,  and  implementation  matters\u2014could  cause  delays  in  achieving \nproject  outcomes.  These  risks  are  mitigated  by  management  commitment  and  sound \nsupervision  built  into  the  project  design  through  implementation  support  and  capacity \ndevelopment. Overall, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \n                                                \n23 Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Distribution  Component;  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Transmission \nComponent (Appendix 2). \n24 The total land area required for the substations is 10.5 hectares, but 6.4 hectares are government-owned. \n25 ADB. 1998.

The handbook defines resettlement as \n\u2015insignificant\u2016 when (i) less than 200 people are displaced from housing; and/or (ii) less than 200 people will lose \nfewer than 10% of their productive assets (income-generating).  \n26 An additional 39 households are absentee landlords that do not reside in the local area, bringing the total number \nof affected households to 48. \n27 Resettlement Plan (Appendix 2). \n28 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nIncrease in prices of raw  Adequate contingencies have been provided in the cost estimate and suitable price \nmaterials exceeds contingency  variation provisions have been included in the bidding documents.
