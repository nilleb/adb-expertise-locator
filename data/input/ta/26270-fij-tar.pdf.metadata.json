INTRODUCTION\n1. In January 1992 the Government of Fiji (the Government) requested\ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Bank for the preparation of operating\nstrategies and a corporate plan covering the period 1993-1997 for Fiji\nDevelopment Bank (FDB). The request was prompted by growing concerns\nregarding the quality of FDB's portfolio and the long-term sustainability\nof FDB's domestic resource mobilization operations, and by the need to more\nclearly identify FDB's prospective role within a changing financial sector.\n2. A Fact-Finding Mission that visited Fiji during July 1992\nformulated a TA project that was responsive to the Government's request.\nSubsequently, both the Government and FDB management have endorsed the\nproposed terms of reference for the TA. This TA first appeared in\nBusiness Opportunities in November 1992.\nII. FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK\nA. Background\n3. The Fiji Development Bank was established as an autonomous\nstatutory body under the Fiji Development Bank Act in July 1967. FDB's\ncurrent authorized capital is F$ 50 million of which F$ 42.3 million had\nbeen issued to and paid up by the Government as of 30 June 1992. The Act\nempowers FDB to provide a full range of banking services.\n4.\t Provision of medium- and long-term loans to key economic sectors\nhas been FDB's main operational activity. Equity investments and\nguarantees have been provided to a limited extent and FDB has undertaken\na range of capital market activities including administration of a unit\ntrust and operation of Suva Stock Exchange.\nB. Previous Bank Assistance\n5. The Bank has provided two loans to FDB for a total amount of US$9\nmillion!'.

The first three TA grants to FDB provided experienced personnel\nfor FDB's establishment and initial operation. The assistance was critical\nto FDB's establishment and appears to have been successful. The fourth TA\ngrant funded a review of FDB's role and functions. While the fourth TA had\nsimilar objectives to the proposed TA, it did not formulate a detailed plan\nfor FDB's future operation. The fifth TA grant assisted in the successful\nrebuilding of FDB's staff training functions following a period of high\nstaff turnover.\nC. FDB's Operational Performance\n7. The value of FDB's annual loan approvals increased from F$ 21.6\nmillion during FY1988 to F$ 72.8 million during FY1992. Approval levels\nduring FY1988 had declined by 40 per cent from the previous year, largely\nas a result of the political events of 1987. The subsequent strong growth\nin lending levels reflected growth in lending to all sectors but with\nparticularly strong growth in lending to ethnic Fijians for commercial\npurposes (from F$ 1.6 million in FY1988 to F$ 16.5 million in FY1992).\n8. On 30 June 1992 industrial and commercial loans accounted for 49\nper cent of FDB's loan portfolio, agriculture loans accounted for 29 per\ncent and loans under special programs supporting the economic development\nof ethnic Fijians accounted for 20 per cent of portfolio value. The\nremaining 2 per cent of the loan portfolio was staff loans.\nD. Portfolio Quality\n9. The value of total arrears in FDB's portfolio has increased\nsteadily from F$ 15.6 million (13.7 per cent of portfolio) on 30 June 1988\nto F$ 39.0 million (16.7 per cent of portfolio) on 30 June 1992. Most\narrears are accounted for by the agriculture and special loans to ethnic\nFijian portfolios.\n10. The FDB management believes that the principal causes of the\ndeterioration in FDB's portfolio quality are (i) disruptions to domestic\nbusiness activities that have occurred since the 1987 political events, and\n(ii) loss of many of FDB's experienced staff since the same political\nevents. Between June 1987 and June 1990, a substantial number of FDB's\nprofessional staff resigned.\n11.\t The response of FDB management to this situation has been to\nstrengthen portfolio supervision procedures and to strengthen staff\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index. For documents generated from scanned hard-copies, there may be portions of \nviewable text that cannot be copied as selectable text as this is dependent on the quality of scanned documents.", "3\ntraining activities!'. The efforts have halted the decline in FDB's\nportfolio quality. However, much work remains to be done before FDB's\nportfolio arrears can be reduced to levels that are sustainable in the long\nterm.\nE. Financial Performance and Status\n12. Reflecting the relatively strong increase in FDB's portfolio\nvalue (from F$ 113.8 million on 30 June 1988 to F$ 238 million on 30 June\n1992), FDB's net profit has increased from F$ 0.48 million during FY1988\nto F$ 0.9 million for FY1992. Total annual income over that period\nincreased from F$ 15.9 million to F$ 24.8 million. However, relatively\nsharp increases in staff costs combined with relatively large annual\nprovisions for doubtful debts have resulted in low profit figures,\nequivalent to 1.7 per cent of average shareholders funds for FY1992.\nAlthough FDB has maintained a conservative debt/equity ratio of around\n2.0/1 since its establishment, the ratio is expected to increase to 3.6/1\nby 30 June 1993. Partly as a consequence of this but also reflecting the\nmaturity profile of bonds issued by FDB, debt-service coverage is expected\nto decline to around 1.15 times during FY1993.\nF. Need for the Technical Assistance\n13. Fiji Development Bank has fulfilled a key role since its\nestablishment 25 years ago as the principal source of term finance for\nprivate sector development projects in Fiji. During that time, Fiji's\nfinancial sector has undergone steady growth and development. Apart from\nthe four foreign commercial banks operating in Fiji, a national commercial\nbank has been established, two merchant banks have commenced operations and\na market in debt securities (mainly issued by public-sector entities) has\nbeen established. The growth in capital market activities is expected to\naccelerate during the medium term. Prospective developments within the\ncapital market during the next two years include the (i) introduction of\na wider range of securities, including certificates of deposit and bankers\nacceptances; (ii) strengthening of rules and regulations for issuance of\nsecurities and for participation of a wider range of companies in the bond\nmarket; (iii) reactivation and strengthening of the Suva Stock Exchange;\nand (iv) liberalization of the environment 5or foreign exchange\ntransactions. As a result of the changes, FDB's role will require some\nredefinition so that competitive pressures can be responded to and new\nopportunities for providing development finance and for domestic resource\nmobilization can be addressed.\n14. The current mode of FDB's operation requires close review so that\nemerging operational and financial difficulties can be promptly and\nappropriately addressed. The major problems in this regard relate to\nii\t TA No. 1209-FIJ had a major objective of strengthening FDB's\nstaff training capabilities.\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

The response of FDB's management to this situation has been to\nrequest assistance from the Bank for the deployment of experts with skills\nnot readily available in Fiji to assist in identifying solutions to current\nissues. The Bank considers that the request is timely and that the TA may\nplay a crucial role in ensuring that FDB adopts a format for its future\noperations that will be subject to appropriate commercial discipline and\nresponsive to the developing environment for private sector investment in\nFiji.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n16.\t The objectives of the TA are to:\n(i) define and evaluate alternative strategies for FDB's\noperation from 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1997, and\nidentify the operational strategy that offers the best\nprospects for FDB's ongoing evolution as a profitable,\nautonomous and self-financing institution able to fully\nsupport the Government's objectives for the promotion\nof private-sector investment activity and for the\ndevelopment of Fiji's financial sector; and\n(ii) develop a corporate plan for FDB's operations from 1\nJanuary 1993 to 31 December 1997 that will provide for\nthe most effective implementation of the operational\nstrategy developed from (i).\nBoth the operational strategy and the corporate plan should provide\nparticular attention to addressing the problems of poor portfolio quality\nand relatively high turnover of top-quality staff.\nB. Scope\n17. The scope of the assignment will include all tasks from the\ndevelopment of alternative strategies for FDB's operations during 1993 to\n1997 through identification of the most effective strategy; preparation of\na detailed strategy statement; identification of FDB's financial, staffing\nand organizational requirements to implement the strategy; and production\nof a corporate planning document suitable for submission to FDB's Board of\nDirectors.\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

Consultant Services and Procurement\n19. The task will require the services of a team of three consultants\nfor a total of five man-months. The team leader will be an institutional\ndevelopment specialist with an appropriate background in development\nbanking and will provide two months of service. One of the other\nconsultants will have a strong background in banking and appropriate\nfinancial analysis skills. His/her services will be required for two\nmonths. The other consultant, who will be required for one month, will\nhave a strong background in treasury and capital market operations. For\nthe task to be successfully implemented, the team leader will need to have\nsubstantial experience of lending within an environment that includes\nsemisubsistence borrowers living in a village environment.\n20. A firm will be engaged to undertake the assignment, which will\ncommence on 1 March 1993 and be completed by 30 April 1993. The selection\nand engagement of the firm will be undertaken in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nD. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n21. The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$140,000. Details of\nthe cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. It is proposed that the\nBank fund the estimated foreign costs (i.e., the cost of the consultants'\nservices) of US$130,000 and that FDB fund the estimated local costs of\nUS$10,000. The TA will be charged to the Bank-funded TA program.\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n22.\t The Executing Agency for the TA will be FDB. Implementation will\nbe monitored by the South Pacific Regional Office.\n23. The consultants will, within two weeks of commencing work,\nprepare a detailed work plan for the approval of FDB's Managing Director.\nThe consultants' subsequent formal documentary submissions to FDB will\nconsist of the operational strategy statement, the business development,\nfinancial, staffing and overall business plans. The consultants will, upon\nthe completion of field work, present a brief report to the Bank detailing\nthe manner in which the task was undertaken and the manner in which the\noutput of the task was received by FDB.\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

The Bank considers that the request is timely and that the TA may\nplay a crucial role in ensuring that FDB adopts a format for its future\noperations that will be subject to appropriate commercial discipline and\nresponsive to the developing environment for private sector investment in\nFiji.\nIII.
