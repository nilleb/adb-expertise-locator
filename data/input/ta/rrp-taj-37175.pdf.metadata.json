It  will  comprise  three \n  components: (i) education system efficiency and management, (ii) \n  equitable access and completion, and (iii) quality improvement. A \n  top-down  approach  to  strengthening  capacity  at  the  Ministry  of \n  Education (MOE) to enhance efficiency, relevance, and equity in \n  primary  and  general  secondary  education,  and  a  bottom-up \n  approach to strengthening schools and district (raion) departments \n  of education in five pilot districts, will help MOE to strike a greater \n  balance between central and local functions. The project focus on \n  strengthening  the  education  management  information  system \n  (EMIS)  is  expected  to  improve  annual  planning  and  budgeting \n  critical to targeting resources to priority reforms and addressing \n  inequities. This is also expected to significantly enhance MOE\u2019s \n  capacity to monitor progress of reforms and respond to emerging \n  needs. \n   \nRationale  Tajikistan\u2019s education system is under significant threat following (i) \n  independence  and  cessation  of  large  subsidies  from  the  former \n  Soviet Union, (ii) prolonged civil strife that caused physical damage \n  to  an  estimated  20%  of  the  school  facilities,  and  (iii)  sharply \n  reduced financing to education resulting from an overall downturn in \n  the economy. The Government is now committed to reverse the \n  trend  with  increasing  support  from  several  external  funding \n  agencies.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  institutionalize  systemic \n  reforms to make primary and general secondary education more \n  affordable, efficient, relevant, and equitable within a coherent and \n  affordable national education development framework (NEDF). The \n  Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided emergency-type physical \n  reconstruction  under  a  social  sector  rehabilitation  project  and \n  recognizes the need to undertake reforms gradually, through a well-\n  informed and participatory process. The ESRP will combine top-\n  down and bottom-up approaches in close collaboration with other \n  development  partners  under  MOE  leadership  to  systematically \n  address urgent reform priorities. \n   \n   \n ", "  iii\n   \nObjective and Scope  The main objective of the ESRP is to support MOE in developing \n  and  initiating  a  prioritized,  costed  NEDF  to  improve  efficiency, \n  equity, and quality of primary and general secondary education. \n  The  ESRP  will  emphasize  system  efficiency  and  management \n  improvement required throughout the education system in order to \n  make the education system more affordable and sustainable. The \n  ESRP will strengthen policy and planning capacity, encompassing \n  key  aspects  of  management  efficiency  (pedagogical  renewal, \n  financial management, and management reorganization). Improved \n  efficiency in these system elements will support enhanced access \n  and completion and improved quality. \n   \n  The  ESRP  will  support  MOE  at  the  national  level  to  manage \n  education reform, and at the district level it will support five pilot \n  districts  for  school  improvement.  The  ESRP  will  have  a  direct \n  positive  impact  on  Tajikistan\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  by \n  improving  equitable  access  to  and  completion  of  better  quality \n  primary  and  general  secondary  education  and  improved  gender \n  balance in school participation in the five pilot districts.  \n   \nCost Estimate  The estimated project cost is $9.375 million equivalent, of which \n  $4.184  million  (45%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $5.191 \n  million equivalent (55%) is the local currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million equivalent)\n  Foreign  Local     \nSource \n  Exchange  Currency  Total  Percent \n  ADB  4.184  3.316  7.500    80 \n  Government         0  1.875  1.875    20 \n  Total  4.184  5.191  9.375  100 \n \n   \n  The Government has requested ADB to mobilize cofinancing in the \n  form of grants from other development partners to substitute for the \n  loan  allocations  for  training,  consultancy  services,  and  project \n  management.  Once  grants  are  firmly  committed,  corresponding \n  savings  under  the  loan  may  be  cancelled  or  reallocated  as \n  appropriate. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies, \n  equivalent to $7.5 million in special drawing rights, from the Asian \n  Development Fund. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including \n  a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per year \n  during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter. The borrower \n  will be the Republic of Tajikistan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date   \n \n ", "iv   \n   \nImplementation   The Implementing Agency will be MOE. MOE and the five pilot \nArrangements  district departments of education will be responsible for day-to-day \n  planning, management, and implementation of project activities in \n  the district. \n   \nExecuting Agency  President\u2019s Office \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  of  ADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil \n  works  will  be  carried  out  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \n  Procurement.  Packages  of  equipment  and  textbooks  will  be \n  procured by international competitive bidding for contracts in excess \n  of  $500,000;  international  shopping  for  contracts  in  excess  of \n  $100,000; and direct purchase for contracts of less than $100,000. \n  Civil works and educational equipment will be carried out through \n  local competitive bidding satisfactory to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  A total of 367 person-months of consulting services (44 person-\n  months of international, including 20 for project management to be \n  shared  with  the  health  sector  reform  project,  and  323  person-\n  months of domestic) will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \n  the Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB for \n  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Consultants  will  be \n  recruited individually or through a firm. The quality- and cost-based \n  selection method will be applied to consulting firms.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The ESRP will support MOE at the national level by strengthening \nBeneficiaries  the  EMIS,  which  will  improve  MOE\u2019s  capacity  for  planning, \n  budgeting,  and  decision-making.  Management  training  programs \n  will benefit 10 MOE managers, 15 regional managers, 30 district \n  managers,  and  300  school  managers,  and  will  contribute  to \n  strengthening  management  capacity  at  all  levels.  At  the  district \n  level, about 50% of the 300 schools in pilot districts will benefit from \n  some form of physical improvement and from school improvement \n  funds (SIFs) that help to improve equitable access to better-quality \n  primary  and  general  secondary  education.  More  than  6,000 \n  teachers in pilot districts will also benefit from in-service training in \n  modern teaching methods. About 90,000 school children in grades \n  1\u201311 will have access to better quality education. Schools in pilot \n  districts  will  benefit  from  more  effective  school  governance, \n  including  formation  of  and  effective  support  from  parent-teacher \n  associations. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  project  faces  three  possible  risks.  First,  successful \n  implementation  depends  on  continuation  of  regular  government \n  financial support to the pilot districts, system rationalization, and \n  realization  of  expected  funding  increases.  The  timely  and  full \n  release of counterpart funds by the Ministry of Finance is another \n  important element in successful project implementation. Similarly, \n  the financial contribution of district education departments to SIFs is \n  critical to sustaining this approach after the project ends, and to \n ", "  v\n  improving school financing. \n   \n  Second,  successful  implementation  depends  largely  on  MOE\u2019s \n  capacity to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate reform activities, \n  including the establishment of an EMIS. In order to manage the risk \n  to project outputs, the design includes technical assistance (TA) in \n  key aspects and management training that specifically addresses \n  capacity building. \n   \n  Third, the ESRP assumes that MOE is committed to significant \n  restructuring of education management. This commitment exists in \n  various  policy  documents,  notably  the  National  Concept  on \n  Education of July 2002. Without such restructuring, inefficiencies \n  will endure, and the results of successful pilot projects may not be \n  fed  into  systemic  reform.  The  ESRP  is  expected  to  lay  the \n  foundation for further reform. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is to provide strong \n  links between project design and implementation, and to provide \n  impetus for building EMIS that is used for informed policy dialog, \ndecision-making,  and  monitoring.  The  TA\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i) \nstreamline EMIS at the Ministry of Education (MOE), region, and \ndistrict levels, (ii) set up EMIS frameworks in the five pilot districts, \n(iii) support a national school census of all primary and general \nsecondary schools, (iv) improve decision-making at all levels, and \n(v) support monitoring and evaluation at the MOE. The TA will serve \nas  a  central  policy  tool  to  improve  MOE\u2019s  annual  planning, \nbudgeting,  and  overall  decision-making  to  address  key  policy \npriorities. ADB will finance the TA on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  TA  is \nestimated  to  cost  $355,000  equivalent,  comprising  $238,000  in \nforeign exchange costs and $117,000 equivalent in local currency. \nADB will provide $300,000 to finance the entire foreign currency \ncost  and  $62,000  of  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will \nprovide the remaining $55,000 equivalent in kind. \n \n \n   \n \n ", " \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Tajikistan for the Education Sector Reform Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for strengthening planning and policy dialogue for education reform, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n2.  Following  cessation  of  economic  transfers  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  after \nindependence in 1991, ethnic pressures contributed to a civil war that began in 1992 and lasted \nuntil 1997. Macroeconomic conditions worsened until 1997 when the economy started showing \nsigns of recovery. Real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002 was 60% of that in 1991. GDP \nper capita in 2001 was $162. Inflation, although lower than in the early 1990s, is still high, while \nreal wages have decreased significantly since 1991. The aftermath of civil war, together with \neconomic depression, has put more than 80% of the population below the national poverty line.  \n \n3.  The  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP),1  endorsed  by  the \nparliament  in  June  2002,  sets  out  efficient  and  fair  provision  of  basic  social  services  to \nvulnerable  groups  as  an  approach  to  reducing  poverty.  The  Government's  medium-term \nstrategy has been set in line with the poverty reduction strategy under its poverty partnership \nagreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in December 2002. The medium-term \nstrategy stipulates that, for social sectors, ADB and the Government will focus on improving \nsocial service delivery to vulnerable groups and rationalizing social sector expenditures to \nensure equitable access to quality education and health services. The Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) for 2015 form the key basis for the Government to monitor performance targets. \nThe project framework in Appendix 1 provides key project targets. \n \n4.  The education system is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and is \nadministered through a network of education departments in each of three regions (oblasts), as \nwell as in Dushanbe, in the Regions of Republican Subordination (RSS), and in the districts \n(raion). Compulsory basic education is 9 years, reduced from 11 years in 1996 due to resource \nconstraints. It is free, as per the constitution, and consists of 4 years of primary (grades 1\u20134) \nand 5 years of lower secondary (grades 5\u20139). Upper secondary comprises grades 10 and 11. \nTechnical and vocational education and training is available after grade 9 (3 or 4 years) or after \ngrade 11 (2 years). Public and private institutions provide tertiary education, with increasing cost \nrecovery at both types of institutions.     \n \n5.  Tajikistan has a rapidly growing population, with children under 17 years old comprising \nalmost 50% of the total population of 6.3 million in 2000. The fertility rate\u2014which was 5.0 in \n1990 and declined to 3.7 in 2000\u2014remains the highest in Central Asia, and the population risks \ndoubling every 20 years. Primary and general secondary education will have an additional \n850,000  students  by  2015,  and  social  services  must  be  ready  to  accommodate  a  rapidly \ngrowing population.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. 2002. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan. \n ", "2  \n6.  Tajikistan  is  committed  to  achieving  the  MDGs  as  stipulated  in  the  PRSP.  The \nGovernment has pledged to reduce poverty incidence from 83% of the population in 1999 to \n58% by 2010 and improve the coverage of primary education from 78% in 2000 (a decline from \nover 90% in 1991) to 90% in 2015. The elimination of gender disparity in primary and general \nsecondary education, mainly in upper secondary (grades 10 and 11), may be possible only by \n2010 or later. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Tajikistan inherited a highly centralized education system with a well-developed network \nof educational institutions, well-trained and -qualified teachers, almost universal access to and \ngender balance in compulsory basic education, and almost universal literacy (Appendix 2). \nEducational indicators were comparable with middle-income countries. These achievements are \nnow threatened. \n \n8.  Declining Opportunities for Education. Following independence, declining resources \nand rising poverty have harmed the education system. Budget allocations to sustain the sector \nhave been constrained, as has the demand for education, as represented by the opportunity \ncosts of participation and poor employment opportunities. Enrollment in preschool and TVET \nhas collapsed, but increased 19% from 1991 to 2001 in primary and general secondary to more \nthan 1.5 million. This comes in spite of a decline in the gross enrollment ratio2 in basic education \nfrom 94.9% in 1990 to less than 84.3% in 2000. Gender imbalance is emerging particularly at \nthe upper secondary level, with the proportion of girls declining from 49% in 1991 to 38% in \n2001. While enrollment has declined in primary education, actual attendance may be even \nlower. Many qualified teachers have left the profession because of very low salaries. Many \nstudents do not have textbooks or learning materials, and school buildings were badly damaged \nfrom the civil war and poor maintenance. More than 40% of parents have told surveys they are \ndissatisfied with education quality.3 The current generation in Tajikistan is at risk of receiving a \npoorer education than the previous one. \n \n9.  Need for a Coherent Vision and Strategy for Equitable, Sustainable Education. \nSince independence in 1991, a significantly reduced budget has been inadequate to sustain a \nhighly developed education system. The PRSP proposes new measures to address challenges \nfacing the sector. Tajikistan envisaged some decentralization in its new Law on Education \n(1994), but this strategy was largely employed to shift financial responsibility downward to local \ngovernments and parents who lack commensurate capacity, conceptual clarity, or resources. \nThe Government wants to introduce a new financing system, involve local governments and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), improve quality through various measures, and make \nappropriate legal changes and amendments. The Government needs to develop a coherent, \nrealistic vision and strategy given that the financial needs of the sector are not affordable within \nthe current economic context. \n \n10.  Weak  Information  Base  and  Poor  Capacity  to  Prioritize  Systemic  Reform  and \nAddress Inherent Inequities. MOE recognizes gaps in the information systems that support \neducation  planning,  such  as  the  lack  of  information  on  learner  performance.  For  planning \npurposes, MOE has access only to broad averages on attendance and distribution of education \ninputs. While it is possible to analyse resource distribution across districts, it is not easy to \n                                                 \n2  Gross enrollment ratio is the total number of children enrolled in school divided by the total school-age population. \nThe primary gross enrollment ratio in a district will be the total number of children enrolled in primary education \n(grades 1\u20134) divided by total number of children aged 7\u201310 in the district. \n3  ADB. 2000. Country Briefing Paper: Women in Tajikistan. Manila. \n ", "  3\nanalyse this distribution below the district level. MOE has weak capacity to monitor equitable \nparticipation or student performance, and lacks the ability to plan accordingly. There is an \nalmost exclusive emphasis on quantitative information, such as the number of students enrolled \nper grade. There is little or no qualitative information on important aspects of education such as \nquality of education management, quality of teaching, or learner performance. The level of \neffective  utilization  of  data  for  planning  is  low.  For  example,  information  on  disparities  in \nexpenditure by region and district is not used to correct disparities. Information gathered by \ninspectors  and  methodologists  is  not  used  to  design  retraining  programs  for  teachers. \nInformation on the quality of school management is not used to design training programs for \nschool principals and parents\u2019 committees; indeed, few such programs are available. Data \nexists within MOE but is not integrated for coherent strategies or plans.  \n \n11.  Because an integrated education management information system (EMIS) and adequate \ndistrict-based information systems are lacking, it is difficult to ascertain whether education is \nequitably  provided  across  or  within  districts.  Although  there  is  substantial  circumstantial \nevidence of inequities, these are difficult to quantify. If little is known about inequities in terms of \neducational inputs, less is known about variations in learning outcomes. It is therefore difficult, if \nnot impossible, to plan for increased equity or quality.  \n \n12.  Inadequate  and  Inequitable  Opportunities  for  Teaching  and  Learning.  The \neducation  system  that  was  conceived  and  developed  for  a  socialist  society  is  now  under \npressure  to  adapt  to  a  market-based,  internationally  competitive  society.  The  teaching \nprofession is unattractive because of low salaries, poor working conditions, and a lack of career \nopportunities. The overall teacher-to-student ratio of 1:15,4 average workload of 14\u201318 hours \nper  week,  and  single-subject  specialization  of  teachers  in  grades  5\u201311  make  the  system \ninefficient and expensive, and it absorbs resources that could be used to improve teacher \nsalaries or provide more textbooks. \n \n13.  MOE made efforts after independence, most recently in 2002, to add new subjects to the \ncurriculum and, in particular, to build national identity. However, the already heavy course load \nhas increased further with the introduction of new subjects. In some cases, the new curriculum \nrequires specialization to start from grade 5 instead of grade 9, as in the past. The curriculum \nmust be made more relevant to the issues dominating Tajikistan's current social, political, and \neducational development, such as the movement toward a market economy; a transparent, \ndemocratic, and just society; attempts to improve system efficiency; and a focus on the quality \nof learning outcomes in schools. There is an urgent need to bring efficiency into both the \ncurriculum development system and the actual curriculum through further reform focused on \nlearning  outcomes.  Curriculum  development  is  currently  coordinated  by  the  Department  of \nScience, which has relied on ad-hoc groups and is fragmented as a result. \n \n14.  Children in schools do not have necessary textbooks. Since independence, the supply of \nfree Soviet textbooks has ceased, and the civil war devastated the existing supply. Parents are \nunable to buy books, and MOE lacks budget to provide them. MOE has been struggling to \naddress this problem. A rental scheme has been introduced to mobilize additional resources. \n  \n15.  Limited and Inefficient Financing. The Government recognizes that tight finances \npose a major challenge to education development. Public funding for education is generally tied \nto norms such as the number of teachers required according to the curriculum at each grade. \n                                                 \n4  Computed on the basis of data supplied by Statistical Department at MOE. The ratio was calculated by dividing the \ntotal number of students by the total number of teachers in Tajikistan in 2001. \n ", "4  \nFunds allocated to line items are set rigidly, and transfer of funds across line items is limited. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) has just introduced unit costs per student to increase flexibility in \nspending. Substantial efforts are now required to implement per-capita funding to enhance \nequity and efficiency linked to student outcomes. \n \n16.  The Government, under its PRSP, plans to gradually increase funding to education from \n2.4% of GDP in 2001 to 3.0% in 2004. However, there are regional disparities due to different \nrevenue bases of local governments and an insufficient budget\u2014particularly at the local levels, \ngiven that over 80% funding for primary and general secondary education comes from local \nbudgets\u2014to  address  such  disparities.  A  set  of  strategic  measures  is  needed,  to  increase \nresources and enhance efficient resource use. This includes identifying and reducing system-\nwide inefficiencies, identifying and reducing high unit costs, developing alternative cost-effective \nmeasures  and  means,  streamlining  and/or  rationalizing  the  education  system,  establishing \n\u201cpartnerships,\u201d generating income, obtaining a larger proportion of the national budget, and \nensuring  successful  reform.  Finally,  it  also  requires  reforming  the  incentive  system  and \nproviding greater flexibility on expenditure management to education institutions and managers \nat all levels. \n \n17.  In a national policy document, the Concept on Education,5 Tajikistan places high priority \non reforming and modernizing its education system. The PRSP recognizes that education \ndevelopment is central to poverty reduction. Tajikistan has publicly committed itself to the \nEducation for All goals and increased educational spending as a percentage of GDP. \n \n18.  Lessons  Learned.  Experience  from  the  ongoing  social  sector  rehabilitation  project \nsuggests  that  project  management  needs  careful  design  and  qualified  staff  to  expedite \nimplementation  and  maintain  quality  work.  It  also  points  out  the  need  to  support  the \nimplementing agency (in this case, MOE), especially when major reforms are involved. Finally, \nhigher-level ownership and support is critical for successful implementation. Without appropriate \nsalaries, performance-related incentives, training, or on-the-job support, it is difficult to ensure \ngood performance and high standards. Effective human resource management at the district \nand  school  levels  requires  sufficient  delegation  of  authority  and  responsibility,  as  well  as \nappropriate  training  with  ongoing  supportive  supervision.  At  the  regional  level,  functional \nanalyses will be important in identifying service and staffing needs and in supporting effective \nworkforce  planning  and  management.  Many  countries  in  Central  Asia  are  supporting \neducational decentralization, but experience shows this requires a strong information base, \nsupport for capacity building, and effective monitoring. \n \n19.  Education reform efforts since 1997 provide more lessons. While efforts such as training \nteachers,  developing  and  distributing  textbooks,  involving  parent-teacher  associations,  and \nrehabilitating school buildings have improved the education sector, there is an urgent need to \nconsolidate  these  efforts  and  to  construct  a  national  education  system  to  (i)  modernize \ngovernance and management, and (ii) develop a curriculum that better prepares citizens for this \ncentury. There is also a need to develop capacity to improve availability and use of information \nto plan and target resources at reducing inequities. The system needs to identify efficiency \nmeasures, and their linkages within the sector to use resources more effectively, as well as to \nrationalize the education system to ensure sustainable, relevant education post independence. \nTajikistan\u2019s tight fiscal situation, combined with high adult literacy, provides opportunities to \nmobilize communities for school improvements. \n                                                 \n5 Government of the Republic of Tajikistan (2002). National Concept on Education of the Republic of Tajikistan. \nDushanbe. \n ", "  5\n20.  Funding Coordination. A major project strategy is to pursue a unique opportunity to \ncollaborate  with  several  other  development  partners  under  the  newly  emerging  funding \ncoordination initiative (Appendix 3). Based on existing comparative advantage and experience, \ncollaboration is being sought to complement MOE-level TA for capacity building, led by the \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID); school improvement funds and \nteacher training, led by the Aga Khan Foundation; the EMIS, supported by the German Agency \nfor Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the Soros Foundation; textbook development, led by the \nSoros Foundation; community-based EMIS, supported by Save the Children Fund-UK and the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF); and baseline student assessment, supported by \nUNICEF.  The  Education  Sector  Reform  Project  (ESRP)  builds  on  ongoing  initiatives  and \ncomplements emerging initiatives from other development partners where there is potential for \nsynergy.  For  instance,  the  pilot  district  of  Roshkala  already  benefits  from  the  Aga  Khan \nFoundation\u2019s support in social, health, and education services. Similarly, the curriculum and \ntextbook development work under the ESRP will be carried out in close collaboration with the \nWorld Bank\u2019s parallel support to textbook policy. The ESRP also supports MOE\u2019s capacity to \ncoordinate funding agencies.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n21.  The goal of the ESRP is to contribute to the Government\u2019s overall strategic goal of \npoverty reduction by improving equitable access to, and completion of, quality primary and \ngeneral secondary education. This goal focuses on girls and vulnerable groups, particularly in \nrural areas. The ESRP\u2019s objective is to support MOE\u2019s education reform program by helping it to \ndevelop a prioritized, costed National Education Development Framework (NEDF) to improve \nefficiency, equity, and quality in primary and general secondary education.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n22.  The ESRP has three components: (i) system efficiency and management, (ii) equitable \naccess and completion, and (iii) quality improvement. The ESRP will have national and pilot \ndistrict components. Pilot components will be implemented in five rural districts: Roshkala, in \nGorno Badakshan Autonomous Region (GBAR); Kulyab, in Khatlon Region; Ayni and Gornaya \nMatcha, in Sughd Region; and Garm, in RRS. The pilot districts were selected based on the \nlevel and severity of poverty, the level of infant and maternal mortality, girls\u2019 enrollment rate, and \nproportion of female teachers (Appendix 4). Geographical variation was also considered. The \nESRP\u2019s goal will have a direct positive impact on Tajikistan\u2019s PRSP, and will target primary and \ngeneral secondary education, with particular focus on girls and vulnerable groups, contributing \nto achievement of key MDGs. Parallel implementation of the ESRP with another in the health \nsector in the same districts will particularly benefit community mobilization, child health, and \nearly education.  \n \n1.  Component 1: System Efficiency and Management \n23.  Improved system efficiency and improved management are required throughout the \neducation system, especially given that the current system is unaffordable. This component \nconsists of three subcomponents described in the following paragraphs.  \n  \n ", "6  \na.  Policy and Planning \n24.  The  policy  and  planning  subcomponent  provides  support  to  the  Department  for \nEducation Policy Development (DEPD) in MOE to develop an NEDF. The NEDF will coordinate \nvarious reform processes toward a broad national education agenda that contributes to national \ndevelopmental  goals  (economic  growth  and  a  vibrant  democracy)  as  well  as  to  specific \neducational targets (increased net enrollment, particularly for girls in grades 10\u201311; increased \nuse of modern pedagogical techniques; more parental control over local educational resources; \nhigh  expectations  of  all  learners;  better  children\u2019s  health  and  school  readiness;  improved \nefficiency of available resources). While the basic components of a framework were set out in \nan ADB-sponsored workshop (19\u201321 September 2002), DEPD will develop it to ensure that the \nNEDF informs government and nongovernment activity at all levels. The NEDF will also function \nas a tool to assess the impact of reform, an education investment decision support aid, and a \ndynamic learning device. The NEDF will be the product of a well-informed consultative process \ninvolving stakeholders at all levels, including parents and community leaders. It will draw from \nthe PRSP, build on the education public expenditure review, and be set within a medium-term \nexpenditure framework to be supported directly or indirectly by other development partners. The \nNEDF will pull together various analyses and build on the initiatives of the Government and \ndevelopment partners. \n \n25.  The ESRP will support MOE in convening four task teams: (i) a financial management \ntask team to design structures and systems to improve the efficiency of financial decision \nmaking;  (ii)  a  pedagogical  renewal  task  team  to  support  curriculum  development,  teacher \ntraining, and instructional materials; (iii) a management reorganization task team, to design and \nmonitor a management reorganization framework of education management responsibilities; \nand (iv) an information and evaluation task team (IETT) to design information systems for \nplanning. DEPD will oversee and integrate the work of various task teams, and will develop \nmedium- and long-term education development plans derived from the NEDF. The education \ndevelopment plans will be outcomes-based, and will contain broad performance indicators to \nallow  for  flexibility  in  implementation  at  local  and  institutional  levels.  The  ESRP,  in  close \ncollaboration with development partners, is expected to influence the development of secondary \nlegislation (decrees and regulations) and possible primary legislation\u2014to the extent feasible and \npractical\u2014as an effort toward longer-term sustainable development of the education sector \n(Appendix 5).  \n \nb.  Information Systems and Monitoring and Evaluation System \n26.  This  subcomponent  provides  for  the  construction  of  a  sound  EMIS,  as  well  as  a \nmonitoring and evaluation system (MES) that will (i) provide a basis for improved planning \nsystems, (ii) help quantify inequities pertaining to gender and poverty, and (iii) ensure that \nanalyzed information is fed back into planning processes and system improvement.  \n \n27.  The ESRP will strengthen the EMIS to improve the quality of information available to \nMOE, education departments at regional and district levels, and education institutions. Elements \nwill be incorporated into the EMIS to quantify inequities and to support school rationalization, in \nsuch  a  way  that  the  overall  cost  and  policy  implications  of  school  rationalization  can  be \nexamined at various levels throughout the system.  \n \n28.  The ESRP provides for the design and implementation of an MES. Standards and \nperformance indicators for various key activities (learning, teaching, management, and support) \nand  actors  (pupils,  teachers,  school  directors,  department  heads,  and  deputy  ministers) \n ", "  7\nthroughout  the  system  are  key  to  the  success  of  the  MES.  Results  should  also  be \ndisaggregated by gender. Various policy documents refer to the need for new standards of \nlearning achievement; however, development of a culture of quality standards for other aspects \nof the system is equally important. For example, the ESRP will allow development of new job \ndescriptions for teachers and education managers, and standards of expected performance and \nrelated indicators. Information on achievement in terms of standards and performance indicators \nwill be crucial and will drive the overall pedagogical renewal effort. The MES will be designed to \nprovide feedback against these standards and indicators, and in this way will give important \ninformation about the success of the reform process and possible enhancements. It will also \nhelp IETT to analyze the differential project impacts and provide suggestions on upscaling \nproject activities. The crucial challenge in this component is to develop a culture of learning at \nall levels of the system (including parents and MOE staff), by ensuring that level-appropriate \ntypes and formats of information are available for continued planning. \n \nc.  Management Development \n29.  The  management  development  subcomponent  provides  for  training  for  education \nmanagers to develop competence in policy and planning, EMIS and MES, pedagogical renewal, \nand financial management (Appendix 6). The management program will be based on a clear \ndefinition  of  competence,  encapsulated  in  program  outcomes,  assessment  criteria,  and \nperformance  requirements.  Credits  will  be  awarded  for  the  successful  completion  of \nmanagement programs, and, with careful attention to the logical combination of topics, such \ncredits can be accumulated as qualifications for different categories of education management \n(for  example,  financial  planning).  An  international  academic  institution  will  be  identified  to \ndevelop 14 management development modules with inputs from key MOE officials, and the \ntraining will be delivered through a national institution. About 10 MOE managers, 15 regional \nmanagers,  30  district  managers,  and  300  school  managers  will  receive  management \ndevelopment  training.  About  10  officials  will  receive  overseas  training  associated  with  the \nmanagement development program. \n \n2.  Component 2: Increasing Equitable Access and Completion \n30.  The ESRP is designed to increase equitable access to and completion of education, with \nfocus on girls and vulnerable groups, using school mapping as a central strategy. Building on \nthe EMIS development, a detailed mapping exercise will define the scope of rationalization, \nleading where necessary to the closure of unsustainable schools. The mapping exercise will \nalso generate two key rankings of schools in the target districts: a rehabilitation index (para. 32) \nand a poverty index (para. 33). The indexes will be used to allocate school rehabilitation funds \n(SRFs) and school improvement funds (SIFs). The strategy will be supported through school \ncommunity mobilization (para. 34). Together, the two indexes will create an overall index of \nschool need. The index of school need, once it has been pilot tested in the target districts, will \nform the basis for policy and planning in the education system as a whole. The funding formulas \ndeveloped by the ESRP will be used to ensure that schools are funded in a manner that reflects \ntheir needs and the relative cost of addressing the needs, taking into account that rehabilitation \ncosts may be greater than quality improvement costs. Crucially, the funding formulas will be \nused to improve the budgeting process. All components will be planned within the information \nfor  planning  framework,  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework,  and  the  financial \nmanagement framework. \n ", "8  \na.  School Mapping \n31.  The school mapping subcomponent supports a comprehensive school- and district-level \nbaseline  survey  to  compare  pre-  and  post-project  cases.  Baseline  information  has  two \ndimensions: (i) quantitative, generating hard data on the location, distribution, and physical \ncondition of schools; and (ii) qualitative, generating a comprehensive gender-disaggregated \nanalysis of learner achievement as well as social and other barriers to schooling. These barriers \nmay include factors such as gender discrimination, poverty constraints, transport difficulties, \nclimate, and poor health. School mapping will generate various outputs: (i) an analysis of the \ndistribution of schools and constraints to access and retention of girls and vulnerable groups, (ii) \nan analysis of school rehabilitation needs and of school poverty at individual schools, and (iii) an \nanalysis of learner achievement. District-level mapping will generate a school rationalization \nplan, and will help to rank all schools in terms of poverty and rehabilitation needs. A physical \nsurvey was already undertaken in Garm (RSS) during project preparation. The UNICEF-Save \nthe Children initiative in community-based EMIS will also be a model for this component. The \nexperience gained by ADB, Save the Children, and UNICEF will be examined. The component \nwill help indicate how school mapping can be replicated nationally to enrich the national EMIS \n(para. 27) and MES (para. 28). \n \nb.  School Rehabilitation \n32.  Through the school mapping exercise (para. 31), schools in target districts will be ranked \nin terms of rehabilitation needs. About 95 schools will be rehabilitated: 40 will receive minor \nrehabilitation  ($10,000  equivalent  per  school),  30  will  see  major  rehabilitation  ($30,000 \nequivalent per school), and 25 will have extensions where classrooms are severely damaged \n($10,000 equivalent per school). The index of school rehabilitation will be used to allocate \nweighted and specified SRFs to the districts, or directly to schools with capacity to manage the \nfunds. Schools serving poorer populations will be allocated greater amounts. SRFs will be \nallocated particularly for school rehabilitation, and will be tied to a school\u2019s ranking on the \nrehabilitation index. Schools would receive the SRF directly if they have produced a school \nimprovement plan (SIP)6 and can demonstrate their capacity to implement it. The evaluation of \nSIPs will be based on simple criteria: it must be the product of a widely consultative effort \namong  school  and  community  stakeholders,  and  there  must  be  mechanisms  to  ensure \ntransparency, accuracy, and accountability in financial management. TA will be provided to \nsupport the overall SIP process at the district and school levels, particularly with respect to \nschool mapping, planning, and local procurement. \n \nc.  School Improvement \n33.  The strategy for school improvement is similar to the strategy for school rehabilitation. \nSchools in the target districts will first be ranked in terms of poverty through the school mapping \nexercise (para. 31). The ranking will be based on key factors, including the proportion of girls \nand female teachers, local income levels, child health, and water and sanitation conditions. The \nindex of school poverty will be used to allocate SIFs to the districts (or directly to schools if there \nis capacity to manage the funds). The SIFs will be weighted in the same manner as the SRFs \n(para. 32). The evaluation of the SIPs will be based on similar criteria to those applied for the \n                                                 \n6  School improvement planning, which is used in several countries around the world, is being proposed as an \ninstrument to strengthen school-level governance, management, and financing to support improvements in key \npriority areas identified by the school community. The SIF, including SRF, is a funding mechanism to support SIP \nproposals from participating schools for improvements in areas consistent with project objectives. The SIP and SIF \nsupport will build on the current experience in Tajikistan. \n ", "  9\nSRFs,  and  appropriate  TA  will  be  provided  to  ensure  sound  financial  management  and \nreporting, among other things. Up to 150 schools in the pilot districts may receive SIFs of as \nmuch as $10,000 equivalent. Up to $2,500 equivalent may be spent for minor repair and up to \n$7,500 equivalent on learning materials (mainly for libraries), teaching aids, basic equipment \n(chalkboards and sports materials), and school attendance and retention schemes, including \nsynergy on child health with activities under the health sector reform project (HSRP). \n \nd.  Community Mobilization  \n34.  Under this subcomponent, community-level stakeholders will be encouraged to take \ncharge of the educational well-being of their children, empowering them to (i) participate in the \neducational process by developing and implementing SIPs, as well as managing SRFs and \nSIFs; (ii) make demands on the system; (iii) hold the system accountable for results; and (iv) \nappoint people at the village level to support the improvement process. These are major steps \nin democratizing the education system and curbing corruption, as well as contributing to school \nimprovement with focus on gender equity, school health, and quality. The ESRP will support \ncommunity mobilization in each pilot district to organize targeted public information campaigns \nsupporting equitable access and quality improvement. In many cases, the ESRP will not be the \nonly community-level reform effort under way, so synergy of effort and economies of scale must \nbe ensured. In each pilot district, a community change agent will be identified to play a major \nrole in this regard. The change agent will be accountable to the appointing committee, which will \ncomprise  elected  representatives  of  parent-teacher  associations.  In  the  long  term,  funding \narrangements for change agents will come from SIFs, and village schools can decide whether to \ninvest in this strategy or not. \n \n3.  Component 3: Improving Quality Education \n35.  This  component  is  designed  to  improve  the  quality  of  education  through  teacher \ndevelopment,  curriculum  development,  and  improved  teaching  and  learning  materials.  Key \nsubcomponents are described in the following paragraphs. \n \na.  Teacher Training \n36.  This subcomponent will draw up a detailed action plan to implement the teacher-training \nelement  of  the  pedagogical  renewal  framework  (PRF).  The  action  plan  will  include  (i)  a \nframework of teacher standards to guide the design of accredited pre- and in-service teacher \ntraining programs; (ii) a teacher appraisal system that will form part of the monitoring and \nevaluation framework (para. 28); (iii) mechanisms to ensure that the results of teacher appraisal \nfeed into the district-level EMIS and into planning for improvement; (iv) incentives (monetary \nand nonmonetary) to ensure that teachers who successfully complete in-service training and \nimplement the new competencies are rewarded; and (v) strategies to attract and retain more \nfemale teachers. Provided that all the action plans meet the outcomes set out in the PRF, the \nvarious districts may pilot different approaches interweaving standards, appraisal, incentives, \nand accredited teacher-training programs, though the standards should be uniform. Over 6,000 \nteachers,  including  all  female  teachers  in  primary  and  general  secondary  schools  in  pilot \ndistricts, will receive in-service training. District-level action plans should be developed in a \nparticipatory manner, with focus on increasing the numbers of girls in grades 10 and 11 and \nfemale teachers. The results of the evaluation of the different strategies will feed into the \nrefinement  of  the  PRF  and  the  NEDF.  Strategies  for  servicing  remote  rural  areas  will  be \nemphasized. \n ", "10  \nb.  Curriculum Development \n37.  A detailed action plan will be drawn up and implemented to support the curriculum \ndevelopment element of the PRF building on MOE\u2019s new curriculum (2002). The action plan \nshould include (i) a framework of competence-based learner achievement standards (generic \nand subject-specific) that will guide the design of the curriculum and of teaching and learning \nmaterials; (ii) a learner assessment system that will form part of the monitoring and evaluation \nframework (para. 28); (iii) mechanisms to ensure that the results of learner assessments feed \ninto the district-level EMIS and into planning for improvement; and (iv) nonmonetary incentives \nto ensure that learner achievement is stimulated continuously and not only rewarded through \ncertification. Two core curriculum subjects in grades 5\u201311 will be renewed to reflect state-of-the-\nart teaching and learning practices. As with teacher training, all action plans must meet the \noutcomes set out in the PRF, but the various districts may pilot different approaches provided \nthat learner achievement standards are uniform. District-level action plans should be developed \nin a participatory manner, in parallel with plans for teacher training. As with teacher training, the \nresults of evaluating the different strategies will support refinements to the PRF and NEDF.  \n \nc.  Teaching and Learning Materials \n38.  A policy on teaching and learning materials will be developed as an element of the PRF, \nas well as a strategy for implementation. The policy and strategy will encompass (i) standards \nfor  producing  teaching  and  learning  materials,  (ii)  linking  between  standards  of  learner \nachievement and teaching standards, (iii) commissioning and approval systems that eliminate \npossible corruption, (iv) cost-effective production and distribution systems, and (v) mechanisms \nfor monitoring and evaluating the quality of teaching and learning materials that feed into the \nmonitoring and evaluation framework. Two core curriculum subjects for grades 5\u201311 will be \ntargeted for textbook distribution, which will support MOE\u2019s textbook rental scheme. Results of \nevaluations will help to refine the PRF and NEDF.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n39.  At  the  national  level,  the  ESRP  provides  an  inclusive  system  reform  framework \n(Appendix 7). This framework will allow key MOE officials to seek TA to identify priority areas of \nreforms  and  to  address  them  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  through  a  more \nconsultative and analytical process. This approach is expected to enhance MOE\u2019s ownership of \nthe reform process. \n \n40.  At the district level, the ESRP relies on school mapping information to rank schools \nbased on poverty and rehabilitation, including gender equity and school health, an approach \nunique to Tajikistan. This is expected to channel support to the most needy schools (para. 31). \nSupport to school improvement plans will strengthen the financing process, and will provide a \nmechanism to link funding to school improvement. \n \n41.  Tajikistan is a transition economy, where the move from rigid central planning to a more \nopen  market  environment  has  created  many  challenges  to  education.  To  cope with  these \nchanges, the ESRP supports policy and institutional reforms, including (i) reorienting education \nservice delivery by strengthening the capacity of schools; (ii) strengthening MOE\u2019s ability to plan \nand  target  resources;  (iii)  refocusing  budget  preparation  from  norm-based  to  per-capita \nallocation; and (iv) promoting accelerated system rationalization. DEPD\u2019s capacity to manage \neducation reform will be considerably strengthened. \n \n ", "  11\nD.  Cost Estimates  \n42.  The total project cost is estimated at $9.38 million equivalent, of which an estimated \n$4.18 million, or 45%, is the foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost is estimated at \n$5.20 million equivalent, or 55% of the total cost. Cost estimates by component are shown in \nTable 1 with details in Appendix 8.  \n \nTable 1.

ADB will provide a loan of $7.5 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources to \nfinance 80% of the total project cost. The loan will be repayable over 32 years, with a grace \nperiod of 8 years. It will bear an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. The borrower will be the Government of Tajikistan. ADB will finance \n100% of the foreign exchange cost, totaling 45% of total project cost, and 64% of the local \ncurrency cost or $3.316 million equivalent. The Government will provide the remaining $1.88 \nmillion equivalent as counterpart financing, which accounts for 20% of the total project cost. This \nincludes financing civil works, taxes and duties, training, workshops, surveys, studies, and other \nrecurrent costs. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2. Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local     \nSource  Currency  Currency  Total  Percent \nADB   4.184  3.316  7.500    80 \nGovernment   0  1.875  1.875    20 \nTotal   4.184  5.191  9.375  100 \n \n44.  The Government has requested that expenditures associated with training, consulting \nservices, and project management be reduced or replaced by grants. At the consultative group \nmeeting held in Dushanbe in May 2003, development partners pledged $900 million for the next \n3 years, including $700 million in grants. ADB has been actively seeking grants to substitute for \nsome of the loan proceeds. As grant funds are firmly committed, corresponding savings under \nthe loan may be canceled or reallocated. Potential grant financing is indicated in Appendix 9. \n ", "12  \nF.  Implementation Arrangements   \n1.  Project Management  \n45.  The ESRP will be implemented in parallel with the proposed HSRP in the same five pilot \ndistricts. The ESRP\u2019s Executing Agency will be the President\u2019s Office, and a deputy prime \nminister will serve as the project coordinator. A national steering committee\u2014chaired by the \ndeputy prime minister and comprising senior officials from MOE, the Ministry of Health, MOF, \nand governors of the pilot districts\u2014will be established to coordinate policy reform, address \nimplementation bottlenecks, and provide overall project guidance. The steering committee will \nmeet quarterly and be responsible for approving the annual project budget and work plans, as \nwell as reviewing and advising on implementation. \n \n46.  A project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up at MOE with three full-time staff to \nundertake technical project functions in full consultation with the four task teams (financial \nmanagement, organizational restructuring, pedagogical renewal, and EMIS and MES). The PIU \nwill be supported by a project administration unit (PAU) to be shared by PIUs at MOE and the \nMinistry of Health to manage procurement, consultants, training, reports on disbursement, and \nmonitoring  of  pilot  districts.  The  PIU,  with  support  from  PAU,  will  organize  quarterly \nimplementation review meetings jointly with the task teams. The PIU will engage part-time staff \nas needed. \n \n47.  Each of the five pilot districts will have a district supervisory group, shared by the ESRP \nand HSRP, comprising the district governor, the chief medical doctor at the district hospital, the \ndirector of the district department of education, two village leaders, two school directors, and \ntwo doctors or health specialists. The group will coordinate district-level activities and ensure \nsynergy between education and health. In each pilot district, the education department will serve \nas the district PIU, comprising a district project coordinator, procurement/civil engineer, and an \nadministrator responsible for district-level implementation and day-to-day management. Project \nmanagement and monitoring capacities will be strengthened at the MOE\u2019s PIU, the PAU, and \nthe district supervisory group and district PIU through targeted staff training. The implementation \narrangements, elaborated in Appendix 10, will promote MOE\u2019s ownership of and commitment to \neducation reform.  \n \n48.  Mobilizing parallel grant funds in response to the Government\u2019s request will result in a \nvariety of financing sources and will impose an additional degree of difficulty in implementing \nand coordinating the ESRP. Coordination of external funding agencies must be enhanced to \ncomplement the roles of the PIU and PAU. \n \n49.  Management  Training  Programs.  Management  development  programs  will  be \ndesigned and delivered by (i) an international academic institution with experience in education \nmanagement development, (ii) a local public training institute, and (iii) consultants working \nunder the relevant components. Key members of task teams will be supported by consultants \nand will receive targeted, short-term, out-of-country training. Management training modules will \nbe developed by an international academic institution and will be delivered through a local \npublic training institute. \n \n50.  Implementation of SIPs, SIFs, and SRFs. Each school in the pilot district will be invited \nto submit a simple SIP proposal for SRFs and SIFs. The education department, with project TA, \nwill review proposals and identify eligible schools. Schools identified to receive SRFs are also \neligible to receive SIFs for instructional materials for teachers, libraries, chalkboards, and sports \n ", "  13\nequipment. Each school identified to receive the SIF will be informed officially by the district \ndepartment of education and will sign a letter indicating its contributions and commitment to \nimplement the funds. Funds to the schools receiving such support will be channeled through the \ndistrict  department  of  education,  or  to  the  school  directly  if  it  has  the  requisite  capacity. \nInternational NGOs with experience in school improvement and community mobilization will be \nengaged to support this activity. The district PIU will organize audits of SIFs and submit reports \nto the national-level PIU. About 25% of the funds available for SIFs will be committed before the \nmidterm review. The midterm review will include a comprehensive review of the SIFs and \npropose improvements. The remaining 75% of funds will be disbursed after improvements \nrecommended in the midterm review.  \n  \n2.  Implementation Period \n51.  The ESRP will be implemented over 5 years. A tentative implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 11.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n52.  ADB-financed goods, related services, and civil works will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Packages of equipment and textbooks will be procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  in  excess  of  $500,000,  international \nshopping for contracts in excess of $100,000, and direct purchase for contracts of less than \n$100,000. Civil works and procurement of basic educational equipment will be carried out \nthrough local competitive bidding satisfactory to ADB. The indicative contract packages are in \nAppendix 12. \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n53.  A total of 367 person-months of consulting services (44 person-months of international, \nincluding 20 for project management to be shared with the HSRP, and 323 person-months of \ndomestic) will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \nprocedures acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will \nbe recruited individually (for project management and for specific technical expertise) or through \na  firm.  Quality-  and  cost-based  selection  will  be  applied  to  consulting  firms.  Appendix  13 \nprovides indicative terms of reference and consultancy requirements. \n \n5.  Contracting Institutions \n54.  Apart  from  consulting  services,  an  international  academic  institution  for  developing \nmanagement development modules and supporting a national academic institution in delivering \ntraining will be identified and engaged competitively according to procedures satisfactory to \nADB. Experienced international NGOs will be engaged to support MOE and the districts in \nimplementing SIFs and mobilizing communities. If international NGOs have experience and \ndistinct  comparative  advantages  over  individual  consultants,  they  will  be  contracted \ncompetitively to support MOE and the districts. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n55.  The PIU will establish an imprest account in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB to \nexpedite disbursement of the loan proceeds, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The Government \n ", "14  \nmay make withdrawals from the imprest account for PIU and district supervisory staff costs; \ntraining, seminars, and studies; locally available materials; domestic consultants; and civil works \ncontracts under local competitive bidding. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest \naccount will not exceed $250,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be followed \nto liquidate the imprest account and reimburse individual payments that do not exceed $50,000. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  The PIU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation in line with ADB\u2019s \nproject performance report and submit them to ADB within 30 days of the end of the applicable \nperiod. Within 3 months of physical completion, the PIU will submit a project completion report \nto ADB. Separate records and accounts for all expenditures financed out of the proceeds of the \nloan will be maintained by the PAU in accordance with sound accounting principles. Auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit project accounts, financial statements, statements of expenditures, \nand imprest account records annually. The audit report should be submitted to ADB in English \nnot later than 6 months after the fiscal year to which it relates.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  System (PPMES)     \n57.  The EMIS and baseline data will provide a foundation for monitoring and evaluation. \nWithin the EMIS framework, the EMIS and MES consultants will work closely with the PIU and \nPAU  to  establish  a  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system \n(PPMES)  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PPMES  will  help  monitor  project  activities  and  regular \neducation data pertaining to primary and general secondary education. The ESRP monitoring \nwill (i) assess the ESRP\u2019s technical performance; (ii) evaluate delivery of planned activities; (iii) \nmeasure project impacts; (iv) measure social and economic benefits with a focus on vulnerable \ngroups, including women and the disabled; and (v) monitor achievement of project targets. \nMonitoring of primary and general secondary education will provide regular information on \nstudents,  teachers,  facilities,  financing,  and  efficiency.  The  baseline  information  will  allow \ncomparing progress made by schools in pilot districts from the beginning of the ESRP to the \nend, and EMIS data will provide a comparative picture between pilot and nonpilot districts. \nPPMES indicators and the baseline data will serve as a basis for assessing differential impacts \nand help develop strategies for expanding pilot activities and preparing reports on project \nimplementation and reform process, including (i) fiscal impacts, (ii) improved use of resources, \n(iii) change in access to services (in particular for females and vulnerable groups), (iv) improved \nservice quality, (v) client satisfaction, and (vi) progress on rationalization. Some indicators will \nbe  monitored  through  project-financed  surveys;  other  indicators  will  be  monitored  through \nregular administrative and financial data drawn from the EMIS. Where feasible, indicators will be \ndisaggregated by socioeconomic level and gender. A list of key performance indicators is in \nAppendix 14. \n \n58.  The  IETT  will  generate  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework,  and  evaluate  and \nredesign the process of building an MES, supported by relevant research and international/local \nTA. The IETT will produce a yearly monitoring and evaluation report with short-, medium-, and \nlong-term goals, objectives, and performance indicators. \n \n9.  Project Review \n59.  The Government and ADB will jointly conduct two annual reviews. The Government and \nADB will jointly establish the issues to be addressed during each mission and reports required. \nA midterm review of implementation arrangements, with a focus on a few key issues, will be \n ", "  15\ncarried out by the Government and ADB 18 months into implementation or later, depending on \nprogress. ADB and the Government will consider changes based on the findings of the review. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n60.  The purpose of the TA is to provide impetus for building EMIS for informed policy dialog, \ndecision-making, and system monitoring. The objectives of the TA are to (i) streamline EMIS at \nthe MOE, region, and district levels, (ii) set up EMIS frameworks in the five pilot districts, (iii) \nsupport a national school census of all primary and general secondary schools, (iv) improve \ndecision-making at all levels, and (v) support monitoring and evaluation at the MOE. The TA will \nserve as a central policy tool to improve MOE\u2019s annual planning and budgeting. Baseline data \nwill help plan project activities, monitor performance, and measure impacts. The TA will finance \n9  months  of  international  consulting  services  and  70  months  of  domestic  consulting  with \nexpertise in EMIS, surveys, and database management. EMIS consultants will work closely with \nthe  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultants.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  months. \nAppendix 15 provides detailed information on the proposed TA. Consultants will be engaged \nindividually according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. For domestic consultants, \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB will be used. \n \n61.  ADB will finance the TA on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA is estimated to cost $355,000 equivalent, comprising $238,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $117,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $300,000 to \nfinance the entire foreign currency cost and $62,000 of local currency cost. The Government will \nprovide the remaining $55,000 equivalent in kind. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n62.  The ESRP will have a positive impact on primary and general secondary education by \nimproving efficiency and quality of education and helping to reduce large discrepancies in \naccess, particularly for girls and vulnerable groups. The expected impact will be achieved by (i) \ninvolving school communities in organizing training, and equipping and rehabilitating education \nfacilities; (ii) campaigning to improve education quality and relevance; (iii) facilitating an increase \nin and targeting of budget allocation to school education; (iv) enabling pro-poor strategies at the \ndistrict level through poverty indexing that will primarily benefit the lower half of the poorer \npopulation in five of the poorest districts; and (v) enhancing the capacity of education personnel  \nto work for girls and vulnerable groups at all levels. The focus on gender equity and school \nhealth through community mobilization and school improvement will enhance the children\u2019s \ncapacity to attend school regularly and improve their performance. \n \n63.  At the national level, the ESRP will support MOE with the development of an NEDF to \nprioritize education reform and strengthen the EMIS and MES to improve policy analysis and \nannual planning, budgeting, monitoring, and overall decision-making. The management training \nprograms will benefit 10 MOE managers, 15 regional managers, 30 district managers, and 300 \nschool directors, and will contribute to strengthening management competency and capacity at \nall levels. At the district level, about 50% of the 300 schools in five of the poorest districts will \nbenefit from SIFs that will help to improve equitable access to better quality primary and general \nsecondary education. Over 6,000 teachers, including all female teachers in the pilot districts, will \nalso benefit from in-service training in modern teaching methods. About 90,000 school children \n ", "16  \nin grades 1\u201311 will have access to better-quality school education. About 50% of the schools in \nthe pilot districts will benefit from some form of physical improvement. \n \nB.  Project Risks \n64.  The  ESRP  faces  three  possible  risks,  particularly  in  the  short  term.  Financially, \nsuccessful implementation depends on continuation of regular government financial support to \nthe pilot districts (paras. 74 and 75), rationalization of the system, and realization of funding \nincreases expected (para. 17). The timely and full release of counterpart funds by MOF is \nanother  important  element  in  successful  implementation  (para.  85).  Similarly,  the  financial \ncontribution of district departments of education to SIFs is critical to sustain this approach, even \nafter the ESRP, and to improve financing to schools.   \n \n65.  Successful  implementation  depends  largely  on  MOE\u2019s  capacity  to  plan,  develop, \nimplement, and evaluate system reforms, including the establishment of an EMIS. Involvement \nof the President\u2019s Office and shared implementation arrangements with the HSRP based on an \nexperienced PAU offset somewhat the complicated implementation arrangements and the risks \narising from the Government\u2019s reluctance to borrow for training, consulting services, or project \nmanagement (para. 44). Any effort to further reduce the provision for these activities may pose \na serious risk to implementation. The national steering committee needs to pay close attention \nto and support the strengthening of MOE capacity to implement project activities and associated \nreforms.  \n \n66.   The  ESRP  assumes  MOE  is  committed  to  significant  restructuring  of  education \nmanagement. This commitment is expressed in various policy documents, notably the National \nConcept on Education of July 2002 (para. 17). Without such restructuring, inefficiencies will \nendure, and the results of successful pilot projects in the target districts may not contribute to \nsystemic reform. The ESRP is expected to lay the foundation for further reform. \n \nC.  Environment \n67.  The ESRP falls under environmental category \"C;\" i.e., the screening process during \nproject preparation identified no adverse environmental impacts. Appendix 16 provides a brief \nsummary of the initial environmental assessment. \n \nD.  Social Analysis \n68.  The ESRP aims to increase equity and effectiveness in the provision of educational \nbenefits by focusing on five pilot districts disadvantaged by natural disasters, civil strife, poverty, \nand vulnerable minority populations. Women and girls are also a specific focus. The ESRP will \nset up social measures likely to benefit the vulnerable groups, women, and children based on \ncomprehensive school mapping in each pilot district. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy form is in Appendix 17. \n \n1.  Poverty Impact \n69.  Poverty  remains  Tajikistan\u2019s  central  development  issue.  Tajikistan  was  one  of  the \npoorest republics even before the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, despite large annual \nbudget transfers from Moscow. The economic collapse of the early 1990s and subsequent civil \nstrife caused poverty to intensify and spread. About 83% of the population was below the \n ", "  17\npoverty line in 1999.7 Poverty rates were high for households with many children, widows with \nsmall children, the unemployed, people without access to any kind of social safety net (the \ndisabled, school dropouts, street children, and the elderly), single pensioners, returnees, and \ninternally displaced people. Rural areas have higher and deeper incidences of poverty, and the \ndirect incidences of poverty occur in remote mountainous areas where the population is mostly \nvery young or elderly. The five pilot districts are considered among the poorest in Tajikistan, and \nthe lower half of the population is intended to benefit more from the ESRP than the upper half. \n \n70.  Poverty  manifests  itself  in  different  forms,  and  disproportionately  affects  vulnerable \ngroups in the education sector. Meager budgetary allocations to education, as well as formal \nand  informal  charges  at  different  levels,  mean  that  the  lowest  economic  quintile  has  to \ncontribute 17.0% of household income to education, compared to just 5.3% for the top quintile. \nPreschool  enrollment,  particularly  of  children  from  poor  households,  has  declined  sharply \nbecause they are unable to pay, so their children are less well prepared to perform in school. \nThe poor have greater difficulty getting textbooks and learning materials because of associated \ncharges. Health problems, greater opportunity costs, and inadequate clothing for bad weather \nmean that regular school attendance among the poor has declined, more so in rural areas and \nin upper grades. A gender gap is emerging, particularly at upper and post-secondary levels, with \na consistent trend across all regions. These analyses will guide poverty indexing and targeting \nunder the ESRP. \n \n2.  Women \n71.  Prior to independence, Tajikistan achieved high adult literacy (99% in 1990) and gender \nparity in educational participation. However, in recent years, girls\u2019 enrolment and attendance, \nparticularly at the upper secondary level, is lower than boys\u2019. The proportion of female teachers \nhas been rising steadily since 1991, and females comprised about 45.7% of the teaching force \nin primary and general secondary education in 2001 (against 37% in 1991). But the decline in \ngirls\u2019 enrollment in grades 10 and 11, particularly in remote locations, may limit the pool of \nfemale  teachers.  Women  in  their  20s  are  slightly  less  educated  than  those  in  their  30s, \nindicating that greater efforts are required to enroll more females, particularly at the upper-\nsecondary  level.  Women,  when  they  work,  are  concentrated  in  the  lowest-paid  sectors\u2014 \nagriculture, education, and health\u2014where wages are insufficient. \n \n72.  The proportion of girls enrolled in grades 10 and 11 in the five project districts is about \n36%, or less than the national average of 38%. The proportion of female teachers is about 35%, \nless  than  the  national  proportion  of  46%.  The  ESRP  will  make  targeted  efforts  to  ensure \nincreased enrollment of girls and a greater proportion of female teachers in project schools. \n \n3.  Ethnic Minorities \n73.  The constitution indicates that no person shall be discriminated against on the basis of \nethnic origin. The constitution also guarantees minorities equal access to education. According \nto some NGOs working in the pilot districts, ethnic minorities are well integrated and enjoy the \nsame health and education status, except for the elderly Russian population that receives \nsupport from NGOs. The ESRP falls under category \u201cC\u201d in terms of minority groups. More \ndetailed information on ethnic minorities is provided in Appendix 4. \n  \n                                                 \n7  World Bank. 2000. Republic of Tajikistan: Poverty Assessment. Washington, D.C. \n ", "18  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n74.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal document.  \n \n1.  Project Implementation \n75.  Within 3 months after the loan effective date, a district supervisory group and a district \nPIU will be established in each of the pilot districts, comprising members acceptable to ADB. \n \n76.  Within  3  months  after  the  loan  effective  date,  all  task  teams  at  MOE,  with  staff \nacceptable to ADB, will be established to implement key reforms. \n \n2.  Policies \n77.  An EMIS and MES committee will be formed within 3 months of loan effectiveness to \nsupport the design, development, and implementation of EMIS and MES, and to facilitate policy \ndialog on education reforms.  \n \n78.  School mapping will be completed by the end of 2004 in all pilot districts to (i) establish \nbaseline information and school ranking; (ii) prepare a school rationalization plan for each pilot \ndistrict  to  improve  efficiency,  equity,  and  environmental  and  sanitation  conditions;  and  (iii) \nensure targeted support to pilot districts and schools.  \n \n79.  Following  school  mapping  results  by  the  end  of  2004,  each  of  the  ESRP  district \neducation departments will submit a time-bound action plan to improve girls\u2019 enrollment in \ngrades 1\u201311, with a particular focus on grades 10 and 11, to be supported by the ESRP. \n \n80.  The ESRP support to civil works and SRFs will be based on (i) school mapping results to \nbe  made  available  by  the  end  of  2004,  and  (ii)  a  simple  SIP  to  be  submitted  by  each \nparticipating school to the district department when seeking funds. TA will be provided to \nschools and district departments as necessary for this purpose. \n \n81.  The ESRP support to teacher training will be based on the teacher-training framework \ndeveloped and the training needs identified in the first year. A phased training program will be \nintroduced in the second year. \n \n82.  The ESRP support to textbook procurement will be based on the textbook development \nframework and development process agreed to during the first year. Two core subjects for \ngrades 5\u201311 will be supported. \n \n3.  Finance \n83.  The  Government  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  necessary  government  counterpart \nfunds. The project director, assisted by the PIU and PAU, will prepare and submit an annual \nbudget plan in time for MOF\u2019s budgeting process in November. The PIU and PAU will also \nsubmit quarterly reports to the MOF on the counterpart requirements for the next quarter. \n \n84.  The share of public expenditure for education will rise from the current 2.5% of GDP to \n3% as stipulated by PRSP, but in any event this shall be achieved by 2008. \n \n ", "  19\n85.  Local governments will contribute about 10% of funds required for SIFs as counterpart \nfunds to ensure sustainability of the scheme and to shift direction to support Government\u2019s \nfinancing reform. \n \n86.  The district education departments, under the guidance of MOE, will prepare a school \nand staff rationalization plan based on the school mapping and EMIS results, with implications \non financing within 2 years of the loan\u2019s effective date. \n \n87.  The borrower will allow any savings generated from efficiency measures introduced \nunder the ESRP, including as a result of system rationalization, to be provided to the local \ngovernments in the pilot districts to support quality improvement, equity measures, and staff \nmotivation in the education sector.  \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n88.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 5,238,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Education Sector Reform \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n \n20 November 2003\n ", "20  Appendix 1 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nGoal  \u2022  Reverse the decline in     \n  education with focus on:     \nTo contribute to the  (i) maintaining literacy rates above  \u2022  Education   \nGovernment\u2019s overall  95%; (ii) increasing public  management \nstrategic goal of poverty  allocations to education and to  information \nreduction by improving  primary and general secondary  systems/national \nequitable access to and  education by at least 3% and 2%  statistics \ncompletion of better quality  of gross domestic product  \u2022  Education for All \nprimary and general  respectively by 2008; and (iii)  monitoring \nsecondary education to  improving student achievement  \u2022  Progress on \nsupport Education for All and  measured by standardized tests  Millennium \nMillennium Development  (language, numeracy, and life  Development Goals for \nGoals   skills) by 10% over the baseline in  education \n  pilot districts by 2008  \u2022  Annual budget \n \nallocation \n \n \nObjective and Purpose       \n       \nSupport the Ministry of  Management Efficiency     \nEducation (MOE) to develop  \u2022 Improved capacity for annual  \u2022 Internal monitoring of  \u2022 Government and \na prioritized, costed national  planning and budgeting at all  implementation of  parliament are committed \neducation development  levels  National Education  to promulgating relevant \nframework  \u2022 Improve pupil-teacher ratio in  Development Framework,  policies and laws for \n  pilot districts by 25% over  within the framework  systemic reform \nImprove quality, efficiency,  baseline  designed by the  \u2022 MOE is committed to \ngreater access to, and  \u2022 School rationalization identified  information and  equitable access \ncompletion of primary and  and addressed within budget  evaluation task team  \u2022 MOE is committed to \ngeneral secondary education,  constraints in pilot districts    management \nwith a particular focus on girls  \u2022 Improved primary and general  \u2022 Baseline data  reorganization \nand vulnerable groups.   secondary cycle costs in pilot  disaggregated by gender  \u2022 MOE is committed to \n  districts by 10% over baseline    from school mapping to  systemic reform \n    be established by 2004  \u2022 Results of successful \n  Access and Equity  and compared with status  pilot projects in the target \n  \u2022 Increased net enrollment rate in  at the end of the Project  districts are not fed into \n  project districts by 10\u201320% over  (2008)  systemic reform \n  baseline \n  \u2022 Increased proportion of girls \n  enrolled in primary and general \n  secondary education by 10\u2013\n  20% in pilot districts over \n  baseline   \n \n\u2022 Improved attendance rates in all \n \nprimary and general secondary \n \nschools in pilot districts by 10\u2013\n \n20% over baseline  \n \n\u2022 Improved cycle completion rates \n \nby 10\u201320% in 80% of target \n \nschools over baseline  \n \n \n \nQuality \n \n\u2022 Improved quality of school \n \ninputs (learning materials, \n \nteacher training, physical \n \nconditions) in 80% of the target \n \nschools in pilot districts \n\u2022 Student achievement improved \nat grade 4 by 10% over baseline \nin pilot districts \n ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nProject Outputs    \u2022 Formative  evaluation  of   \n  \u2022 Relevant policies and laws are  management efficiency at   \n1.

The  education  system  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  is \nadministered through education departments in each of the country\u2019s three regions as well as in \nDushanbe, and education officers in the Regions of Republican Subordination and at the district \nlevels in all regions.  Basic education is 9 years (grades 1\u20139), reduced from 11 years in 1996 \ndue to resource constraints. It is compulsory and free as per the constitution, consisting of 4 \nyears (grades 1\u20134) of primary and 5 years (grades 5\u20139) of lower secondary. General upper \nsecondary comprises grades 10 and 11. Technical and vocational education and training is \navailable after grade 9 (3 or 4 years) or after grade 11 (2 years). Tertiary education is provided \nby public and private institutions with increasing cost recovery at both types of institutions. Table \nA2 provides summary statistics on the education system. \n \nTable A2: Tajikistan Summary Education Statistics \nLevels  1991/1992  2001/2002 \n  School  Students Teachers School Students  Teachersa\nPreschool  882  145,100 10,687 501 58,000  4,600\nPrimary and General  3,179  1,310,200 95,000 3,642 1,558,200  100,200\nSecondary (1\u201311) \nPrimary (1\u20134)  614  537,000 \u2014 660 685,520  \u2014\nBasic (1\u20139)  634  1,139,600 \u2014 855 1,433,360  \u2014\nSecondary (5\u201311)  669  1,057,100 \u2014 612 872,480  \u2014\nTVET  124  82,500 6,096 118 26,800  4,196\nTertiary  13  69,300 \u2014 30 84,200  5,665\nTotal  4,198  1,607,100 111,783 4,291 1,685,000  113,154\nTVET = technical and vocational education and training \na  Latest available data from 2000. \n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Government statistics; World Bank. \n \n2.  Allocations  to  education  as  a  percentage  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  have \ndeclined from over 11% in 1991 to 2.5% in 2002, although the allocations have increased \nslightly since 2001. Allocations to primary and general secondary education have risen from \naround 44% of the education budget in 1992 to over 75% in 2003, indicating a rising priority on \nand  needs  of  primary  and  general  secondary  education.  Private  spending  on  education, \naccording to the 1999 Tajikistan Living Standard Measurement Survey, is almost 50% of total \nspending  on  education,  although  the  bulk  of  the  spending  is  at  the  tertiary  level.  Every \nhousehold with one or more members attending education institutions spends some money on \neducation. \n \n3.  Declining  resources  and  rising  poverty  have  had  significant  adverse  impact  on  the \neducation system since 1991. Enrollment levels have collapsed in preschool education from \n145,100 in 1991 to 57,800 in 2001 and in technical and vocational education and training from \n82,500 to 49,100 during the same period. This is largely because of the collapse of state \nenterprises  that  funded  these  institutions.  Gross  enrollment  has  fallen  in  basic  education \n(grades 1\u20139) from 94.9% in 1990 to 84.3% in 1999. The fall has been sharper at the upper \nsecondary  level  from  40.5%  in  1990  to  17.2%  in  1999.    Gender  imbalance  is  emerging, \nparticularly at the upper secondary level, with girls\u2019 enrollment sharply declining from 49% of the \ntotal enrollment in 1991 to 38% in 2001. However, official statistics indicate that literacy is \nalmost universal. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  25 \n4.  In-service teacher training is insignificant, and more than 50% of the students graduating \nfrom pre-service teacher training do not enter the profession because of very low salaries and \npreference  for  other  professions.  Teacher  salaries  increased  in  2002,  but  many  teachers \nsupplement their salaries by teaching more than one shift. Similarly, many experienced and \nqualified teachers have left the profession, resulting in about 20% of the teachers with no \ntraining in 2000 compared to 9% in 1991, and 62% of the teachers with university training in \n2000 compared to 77% in 1991. \n \n5.  Internal and external efficiency of the education system is considered low. A smaller \nproportion of students is completing the general secondary cycle. A pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 \nand a teaching-to-non-teaching staff ratio of 1:1.5 are considered very low and indicate room for \nsignificant improvement. Lower participation of females (less than 40% of total enrollment) \nbeyond the basic level needs to be improved. Improvement in student assessment is critical to \nimprove efficiency of available resources. \n \n6.  Attendance rates have particularly declined in primary and general secondary education \nto around 80%, but more sharply in upper secondary education, with adverse implications on \nquality. Children\u2019s attendance has declined mainly because they lack textbooks or learning \nmaterials, have health problems (malnutrition, anemia), experience rising opportunity costs, and \nother  problems  associated  with  poverty.  More  than  40%  of  parents  have  expressed \ndissatisfaction over the status of education quality.1 The current generation in Tajikistan is at risk \nof receiving a poorer education than the previous one. \n \n7.  In line with the Government\u2019s policy stipulations, the ADB-supported education sector \nreview proposes key reforms, including (i) constructing a national education system, (ii) moving \naway  from  the  command-and-control  mode  of  educational  delivery  that  characterized  the \nprevious centralized system, (iii) modernizing system governance and management, and (iv) \ndeveloping a curriculum to better prepare its citizens for this century. A key challenge is that \nTajikistan can ill afford to run the system it inherited at independence. Despite funding agency \ndriven reform efforts over the last 5 years, Tajikistan still faces similar problems: infrastructural \nruin  and  neglect,  displaced  communities,  institutional  breakdown,  a  brain  drain  of  highly \nqualified experts, the emergence of a shadow economy that rivals the \u201cofficial\u201d economy, and \nthe deterioration of public services. More recently, external funding agencies in the education \nsector have begun to improve coordination to support the Government. \n \n8.  Tajikistan now faces a formidable task of reforming its education system. Problems \nadequately addressed in small-scale pilot projects are yet to be taken to scale, while the rest of \nthe system confronts major challenges. However, opportunities do exist. The Government has \npressed forward with the formal adoption of a poverty reduction strategy that recognizes the \neducational development as central to relieving poverty. Tajikistan has publicly committed itself \nto education and educational spending as a percentage of GDP.  \n \n9.  Donor coordination has begun to move forward with key funding agencies coordinating \nunder the auspices of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and beginning to work \nclosely with the Government by complementing each other, avoiding duplication, and stressing \nkey reform priorities. Asian Development Bank, World Bank, UNICEF, the Soros Foundation, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Country Briefing Paper: Women in Tajikistan. Manila. \nOSI. 2003.

It is encouraging to note that more agencies \nsuch  as  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) are now supporting education with more \nexternal resources. ADB will complement other funding agencies by supporting the Ministry of \nEducation with educational management information system, policy analysis, organizational and \nfinancial management, textbook development and distribution of two core subjects for grades 5\u2013\n11, and school improvements and rehabilitation in five pilot districts. World Bank will support \ncurriculum and textbook development, teacher training, and school improvement and school \nrehabilitation in seven pilot districts; USAID in teacher training, curriculum development, and \nschool rehabilitation; the World Food Programme in school feeding; GTZ in teacher training and \neducation  management  information  system;  UNICEF  in  policy  analysis  and  school \nimprovement; the Aga Khan Foundation in teacher training and school improvement; and the \nSoros Foundation in teacher training and textbook development.  \n \n10.  The Government\u2019s commitment to reform reflected in its National Concept on Education \n(2002) and poverty reduction strategy and program, the initial recognition by key stakeholders of \nsome of inherent difficulties, and emerging coordination among key funding agencies provide \ngood  opportunities  to  address  some  of  the  key  challenges  that  Tajikistan  is  facing  in  the \neducation sector. A reliable information system to enhance policy analysis, to prioritize and \nenhance efficiency in the existing system, and to mobilize resources will help the Government \nwork closely with key stakeholders to develop a realistic guiding vision that is well informed, \nrational, and affordable.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR \n \nDevelopment  Project Title  Duration  Amount  Key Coverage \nAgency  ($ million) \nADB  Social Sector Rehabilitation Project  2000\u20132003  7.8  Rehabilitation of 200 schools, textbooks for grades 5\u20139, and teacher \n        training \n         \nADB  Education Sector Reform Project (proposed)  2003\u20132008  7.5  EMIS, financial and organizational management, textbook \n        development and distribution and school improvements and \n        rehabilitation \n         \nAga Khan  Allied Schools Program and Program to  Ongoing  N/A  Support to teacher training, school improvement, health education, \n  Support Institute of Pedagogical Development      and policy support \n         \n         \nCARE  Education Program   2001\u20132004  1.5   School repairs, food incentives for girls (grade 6\u201311), teacher training \n        (professional development);

Ethnic groups are widely distributed throughout the country, although on a local level \nsome clustering tends to occur. Higher concentrations of Tajiks may be found in central and \neastern regions, or specific river valleys. Uzbek settlements are more common in southwestern \nor western villages and centers, and Russians or Russian-speaking populations live in larger \ntowns and in Dushanbe. \n \n2.

The Russian minority is mostly \nold and poor, remaining in Tajikistan when most Russians left during the civil war.

Based  on  the  review  of  recent  government  documents\u2014including  the  Concept  on \nEducation1, a national policy document\u2014possible legislative changes that will be supported by \nthe Project are listed below. These legislative changes have already been proposed by the \nGovernment; the ESRP will assist the Government in supporting the following changes in order \nto strengthen the policy framework:  \n \nA.  Pedagogical Renewal \n \n2.  The national Education for All assessment2 anticipates a review of education legislation \nto provide a legal basis for education standards. Enabling legislation is needed that stipulates a \nprocess for promulgating educational standards, but does not incorporate actual statements of \nstandards. In this way, the process of standard setting will be flexible, and can be supported by \npiloting  standards  at  different  levels  and  in  different  sectors  of  the  education  and  training \nsystem. \n \nB.

Management Efficiency. The indicators are \n \n(i)  improved capacity for more informed annual planning and budgeting at all levels; \nbased  on  the  education  management  information  systems,  school  mapping \ninformation, and management training; \n(ii)  improved pupil-teacher ratio by 25% over the baseline in pilot districts; \n(iii)  school rationalization identified and addressed within budget constraints in pilot \ndistricts, based on school mapping information available in the first year; and \n(iv)  cycle costs in pilot districts improved by 10-20% over baseline, which will help \nmonitor cost per student for completing primary and general secondary cycles. \n \n3.  Access and Equity. Targets are \n \n(i)  increased public expenditure on education, from 2.4% of gross domestic product \nin 2001 to 3.0% by 2008; \n(ii)  increased net enrollment ratio in all pilot districts by at least 10% over baseline; \n(iii)  increased proportion of girls enrolled in 80% of all target schools by 10-20% over \nbaseline; and \n(iv)  Improved monthly attendance rates in 80% of all target schools by 10-20% over \nbaseline. \n \n4.

For  baseline  data  on  grade  4  student  achievement, \ndiscussions are under way with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to repeat \ntheir monitoring and learning achievement tests in pilot districts at the beginning and end \nof the The ESRP. \n \n \n ", "48  Appendix 15 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR STRENGTHENING PLANNING AND POLICY \nDIALOGUE FOR EDUCATION REFORM \n \nA.    Background and Rationale \n \n1.  In order to establish an effective educational management information system (EMIS), it \nis important to address the following issues:  \n \n(i)  Detailed  information  on  education  institutions,  particularly  on  schools,  is \nconsolidated at the district level, and again at the city/region level before being \nsubmitted to the Ministry of Education (MOE). This means that the MOE has \naccess only to broad averages and totals for planning purposes. While it is \npossible to analyze the distribution of resources across districts, it is not easy to \nanalyze this distribution below the district level. The capacity of the MOE to \nmonitor equity in education, and to plan accordingly, is therefore weak. \n \n(ii)  There  is  an  almost  exclusive  emphasis  on  quantitative  information  such  as \nlearner  numbers  per  grade.  There  is  little  or  no  qualitative  information  on \nimportant factors such as quality of education management, quality of teaching, \nor learner performance.  \n \n(iii)  Effective  use  of  data  for  planning  is  poor.  For  example,  information  on  the \ndisparities  in  expenditure  by  region  and  by  district  is  not  used  to  correct \ndisparities. Information gathered by inspectors and methodologists is not used to \ndesign retraining programs for teachers. Information on the quality of school \nmanagement is not used to design training programs for school principals and \nparents\u2019 committees; indeed, few such programs exist. \n \n(iv)  Data exists in diverse locations within different levels of the system and the MOE. \nThis data is not integrated to generate coherent strategies and plans. \nB.    Objectives \n \n2.  The  purpose  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  provide  impetus  in  building \nmanagement  information  systems  for  informed  policy  dialog  and  decision-making.  The \nobjectives of the TA are to (i) streamline EMIS at the MOE, region, and district levels, (ii) set up \nEMIS frameworks in the five pilot districts, (iii) support a national school census of all primary \nand general secondary schools, (iv) improve decision-making at all levels, and (v) support \nmonitoring and evaluation at the MOE. The TA will serve as a central policy tool to improve \nMOE\u2019s annual planning, budgeting, and system monitoring. Baseline data will help plan project \nactivities, monitor performance, and measure impacts.  \n   \nC.  Scope and Methodology \n \n3.  The  project  design  contains  a  central  emphasis  on  systemic  reform.  The  Project \nprovides for the development of a National Education Development Framework (NEDF). The \nNEDF  will  ultimately  set  standards  and  specify  outcomes  for  system  and  management \nefficiency, for access and equity, and for pedagogical renewal. The framework will also specify \nthe types of system change that are required; for example, changes in systems like budgeting \nand structures (reorganization of system management).  \n \n ", "  Appendix 15  49 \n4.  The Project was essentially intended to improve policy and planning capacity in areas \nsuch  as  financial  management,  management  reorganization,  and  pedagogical  renewal. \nHowever, data is unreliable and analysis is weak, making it difficult to support policy and \nplanning.  A  \u201ckick-start\u201d  is  therefore  needed  as  soon  as  possible  in  the  form  of  EMIS \ndevelopment. A rapid national survey of schools is required to eliminate fundamental problems \nsuch as poor data on teachers, learners, and the location, size, and condition of schools. A \ndatabase on school conditions will greatly facilitate the initial phase of assistance in policy and \nplanning, and will also provide initial impetus for enhancing equity and access. \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n5.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $355,000, of which $236,000 is the foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $119,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance $300,000, covering the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $64,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB will finance the TA on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill finance the balance of the local currency cost, $55,000 equivalent, by providing counterpart \nstaff, office space with utilities for TA administration, and workshop facilities.

Country  Poverty  Partnership \nSocial Sector  Agreement?   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \n \nNet enrollment and school attendance rates, particularly at the upper secondary level (grades 10-11), \nare higher for children coming from higher-income quintiles. Strategic and targeted investment in primary \nand  general  secondary education  is  critical  to  sustaining  high  levels  of educational  attainment  in \nTajikistan. The ESRP will target investments to improve efficiency and quality of education, and help to \nreduce  large  discrepancies  in  access  to  quality  education  services,  particularly  in  pilot  districts. \nIncreased participation by the poorer population in better quality education is expected to provide more \nneeded skills to face emerging labor market needs, provide better earning potential, improve health \npractices, and contribute to enhancing social cohesion. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification \n \nAbout 83% of the population lives below the poverty line. About 341,800 people, or 5% of the total \npopulation, live in the five pilot districts of whom over 83% (more than 284,000) live below the poverty \nline. About 90,000 students are enrolled in 298 schools and about 20,000 school-age children are either \nout of school or do not attend school regularly. The five pilot districts are considered poorer than average \nbased on the level and severity of poverty (poverty rating developed by World Bank for all districts), the \nlevel of infant and maternal mortality, the proportion of girls\u2019 enrollment, and the proportion of female \nteachers in schools. \n \nThrough school mapping, the ESRP will identify factors inhibiting access to and regular attendance at \nschools to identify and target support to out-of-school children and those not attending schools regularly. \nRegular school attendance has declined, particularly among the poor and more so in rural areas and \nupper grades. These factors may include gender barriers, health problems, greater opportunity costs, and \nother  problems  associated  with  poverty.  A  poverty  index  and  a  school  rehabilitation  index  will  be \ndeveloped to rank all schools into four quartiles.  \n \nThe ranking of schools based on poverty and school conditions is designed to target the lower half of the \npoorest population. About 45,000 students studying in about 150 schools falling in the lower half of the \npoverty index will benefit more from the ESRP. Similarly, about 20,000 school-age children who are out of \nschool or not attending schools regularly will benefit from improved access to schooling. This will help \nlocal governments responsible for primary and general secondary education to plan better and target \nresources. This will also help to target the poor who can ill afford textbooks and learning materials. \n \n            The ESRP is classified as Core Poverty Intervention.      \n \nC.  Gender and Development   \nFor the first time in many years, women in the 20-30 age group are less educated than those in 30-40 \nage group, indicating that girls in recent years have received less education. Although Tajikistan had \nachieved gender parity in education, this is now threatened. While girls\u2019 enrollment up to grade 9 is \nslightly less than that of boys, it drops significantly to 38% in grades 10 and 11 nationally, and to 36% in \npilot districts. While national attendance is around 80% in basic education, girls\u2019 attendance is estimated \nto be less. Unless this trend is rectified soon, the situation may deteriorate further. The ESRP will directly \nor indirectly benefit more than 37,000 girls enrolled in grades 1-11 in project schools. Over 14,000 girls \nestimated to be out of school in project districts are expected to benefit from improved access to schools. \nThe ESRP will target girls to ensure that their enrollment and attendance in primary and general \nsecondary schools increases by 10-20% in pilot districts, with particular emphasis in grades 10 and 11.  \n ", "54  Appendix   17 \n \n \nAt  the  national  level,  the  educational  management  information  system  will  assist  the  Ministry  of \nEducation\u2019s annual planning and budgeting to target girls\u2019 participation. At the district level, a combination \nof school mapping and school improvement funds will allow district education departments and schools to \ntarget funds to support improved participation of girls. School mapping will also identify the number of out-\nof-school girls and factors inhibiting girls\u2019 participation. Social analysis under school mapping will also \nanalyze government policies and strategies on increasing girls\u2019 enrollment and increasing the proportion \nof female teachers and female employees in the education system. School improvement proposals will \nsupport locally appropriate strategies to improve girls\u2019 enrollment and completion by targeting girls. \n \nGender plan prepared? None required. The above strategies are well reflected in the ESRP.  \n \nD.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared                                                                                          Yes \nA multilevel consultation process with a wide range of stakeholders was carried out during project \npreparation. Primary stakeholders include service users and providers at the region (oblast), district \n(raion), and village (jamoat) levels. Secondary stakeholders comprised national and local policy and \ndecision makers.  \n \nParticipatory strategy: \nComprehensive school mapping will identify quantitative and qualitative factors associated with school \nimprovement in all primary and general secondary schools in all pilot districts. The provision of school \nimprovement funds requires extensive consultations by parent-teacher associations in each participating \nschool. Community mobilization supports a full-time district level community change agent to work closely \nwith village organizations and parent-teacher associations to facilitate school improvement through wider \nparticipation and greater synergy with other relevant activities and agencies at the district level.   \n \nE.

Macroeconomic Context \n \n1.  A  high  debt  burden,  inefficient  tax  collection, and  the  increasing  importance  of the \ninformal economy have contributed to economic decline in Tajikistan. Tajikistan is one of the \npoorest countries in the world, with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of US$162 in \n2001. Although about 83% of the population remains below the poverty line and unemployment \nis estimated as high as 30%,1 Tajikistan's human development index ranking (112 in 2002) \nremains high compared to other developing countries because of its historical achievement in \nsocial development. \n \n2.  Low  levels  of  public  expenditure  on  education  are  partially  explained  by  poor \ngovernment capacity to raise tax revenue. Total revenue from tax is around 14% of GDP, which \nis low for a developing country. \n \nB.  Consideration of Design Alternatives and Cost Effectiveness \n \n3.  There  is  a  firm  economic  rationale  to  justify  public  investment  in  human  capital  to \nenhance the earning potential and social benefits. Global studies indicate high rates of return on \ninvestment in education; the highest returns are in primary education, with rates of return ROR \nabove 20%. Secondary education sees ROR above 15% in low income countries.2 \n \n4.  Three scenarios were considered to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the ESRP: (i) \nkeeping  the  status  quo,  (ii)  increasing  the  education  budget  without  significant  systemic \ninvestment or change, and (iii) making the investments as planned in this proposal. The first \nalternative was rejected because all available analyses indicate that the current situation is \ndeteriorating to the detriment of many school age children. The second alternative was also \nrejected because the system requires major reforms to make it sustainable; for example, if all \nthe currently prescribed textbooks were distributed to all school children, this item alone would \nconsume all the education resources. The third alternative is therefore being pursued. \n \n5.  The third alternative was further analyzed under three alternatives. First, an investment \nloan modality was proposed since the country has begun to stabilize following the protracted \ncivil war, there is a need to move away from emergency-type operations, and there is a need to \nbuild on different initiatives from different agencies, including coordination mechanisms. The \nenvironment is not yet appropriate for program- or sector development program-type operations \nsince  it  is  first  critical  to  establish  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  sector,  develop  initial \ninformation base, and build institutional capacity, and establish good donor coordination before \nembarking  on  more  comprehensive  policy  reforms.  The  investment  modality  proposes  to \nsupport  some  of  key  elements  (national  education  development  framework  [NEDF],  donor \ncoordination,  piloting  of  school  reforms,  information  base),  which  would  facilitate  other \nmodalities in the future. Initial donor coordination is already emerging. \n \n6.  Second, project components are packaged by national and district levels to ensure cost-\neffective use of resources. Systemic reforms are necessary at the national level, whereas \ndistrict-level investments involve direct interventions at the district, school, and community levels \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2000. Republic of Tajikistan Poverty Assessment.

Washington, D.C. \n ", "  Appendix 18  57 \nin line with the NEDF. The first component to support the development of the NEDF sets the \nstage for the Ministry of Education to develop medium-term education plans underpinned by the \npoverty reduction strategy paper, a public expenditure review, and a medium-term expenditure \nframework. While the national capacity is enhanced, the focus on school improvement based on \nobjective criteria (baseline information from school mapping) and community mobilization at the \ndistrict level will further strengthen the linkage between national policies and implementation at \nthe school level. Finally, the focus on quality improvement through teacher training, curriculum \ndevelopment,  and  instructional  materials  in  line  with  the  national  framework,  followed  by \nprovision of training and instructional materials at the school level, will make investments more \ncost-effective, coherent, and sustainable, all critical elements for Tajikistan.  \n \n7.    Third, school improvements are cost-effective since school selection will be based on \nobjective criteria such as poverty level, school conditions, resource mobilization, community \nsupport,  and  financial  sustainability.  The  review  of  this  approach  is  based  on  eligibility  of \nschools, as well as quality and other output-based performance indicators. Since not all schools \nwill receive school improvement funds, the process will generate competition leading to a more \nefficient,  equitable,  and  better-quality  primary  and  general  secondary  school  system.  This \napproach also complements the efforts of other development partners who share the need for \nreform at the level of service delivery.  \n \nC.  Fiscal Impact \n \n8.  The  Government  will  finance  about  20%  of  the  ESRP  cost.  The  total  ESRP  cost, \ninclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  contingencies,  and  interest  charges,  is  $9.38  million  over \napproximately 5 years. A financial sustainability analysis was done to evaluate the impact of the \nESRP  on  the  government  budget  (Table  A18).  Based  on  economic  development  and \nexpenditure trends, projections were made to assess the annual recurrent expenditure as a \nresult of the project investment so that the Government is presented with a clear funding \ncommitment. Although education expenditures increased substantially during the last 3 years, \nprojections were  conservatively  made  under  the  following  assumptions:  (i)  maintenance  of \neducation expenditure at over 3% of GDP and 17% of state expenditure throughout the project \nperiod; and (ii) incremental recurrent costs after the ESRP will be maintained at about 20% of \nproject costs (to decrease gradually). \n \n9.  Of the total ESRP cost of $9.38 million, the Government will finance about $1.88 million.  \nThe Government\u2019s annual share in ESRP costs will average around $310,000 equivalent, which \nis about 0.91% of the average annual projected education budget of about $34.4 million. The \nrecurrent costs to be borne by the Government during the project period are estimated at \n$200,000  per  year  and  include  (i)  operating  expenses  of  project  implementation,  and  (ii) \noperating and maintaining renovated school facilities and equipment.  Based on projections, the \nresulting impact of the project on total education expenditure is only 0.1%; and about 1.1% and \n1.4% respectively on general education budget expenditures and local expenditures. Assuming \nthe education spending is maintained, the budgetary impact of the estimated annual recurrent \ncosts during and after project implementation is minimal. In parallel, the World Bank will provide \na $20 million loan (of which $7 million is grant) to implement reforms in seven pilot districts.  The \nUnited States Agency for International Development  and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische \nZusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical Cooperation, GTZ) will extend $5 million and \n$2 million respectively during the next 2\u20133 years. These external fund sources average over \n12% of education budget expenditures during the project period. Recurrent costs of externally \nfunded  projects,  on  the  other  hand,  average  about  2.1%  and  1.2%,  respectively,  of  the \n ", "58  Appendix 18 \neducation budget expenditures during and after the project period, and appear manageable \nover the medium term. \n \n10.  The  ESRP  is  designed  to  minimize  recurrent  costs  for  the  Government  and  the \ncommunity. The improvement of the quality and management support systems under the ESRP \nis intended to improve efficiency of the education system. The development of appropriate and \nimproved system will result in an efficient use of resources and an effective delivery of services. \nThe costs associated with system development are one-time costs to support reforms, and \ntherefore the incremental costs from the ESRP are negligible and sustainable. Although school \nrehabilitation and school funds are being financed, sustainability is being ensured through \ncommitments  from  the  local  community  (particularly  parent-teacher  associations)  and  local \ngovernment, with support from stronger district departments. \n \nD.  Education Sector \n \n11.  A sharp decline in the economy following Tajikistan\u2019s independence in 1991 has had a \nserious impact on social-sector financing. The sharp decline in financing to education from over \n11% of GDP in 1991 to around 2.4% in 2001 and the severe damage inflicted to the education \ninfrastructure during the protracted civil strife have eroded past achievements. Tajikistan cannot \nafford  the  education  system  of  its  past.  Since  the  system  is  making  efforts  to  align  with \ndemocracy and an emerging market economy, serious care is needed to adopt an efficient, \nsustainable approach to financing. While there is a need to increase resources for education, it \nis equally important to streamline structural problems. A major project objective is to help the \nGovernment to move in this direction by laying the foundation for a longer-term financing \nframework.  The  design  comprises  components  that  support  management  and  technical \nefficiency to make investment more affordable and sustainable. \n \n12.  From 2000 to 2002, the social sector absorbed over a third of the total government \nexpenditure. The share of social spending in total state expenditures grew from about 34% in \n2000  (4.7%  of  GDP)  to  42%  (5.9%  of  GDP)  in  2002,  indicating  the  Government\u2019s  rising \ncommitment to improving social services. After significant declines in the mid-1990s, education \nspending as a share of total state expenditures has increased steadily from 15.3% in 2000 to \n17.6% in 2002. Per capita spending grew from $2.86 to $4.34 during the same period. It is \nprojected that government and per capita spending will reach 18.9% and $4.95 respectively in \n2003.  By international comparison, however, Tajikistan\u2019s annual education spending as a share \nof GDP has been the lowest in Central Asia at around 2.5% in 2001. \n \n13.  Private expenditure in education is about 50% of the total expenditure, with almost all \nfamilies spending some money on education, the bulk of it at the tertiary level.3 Following the \nLaw on Education (1994), several private schools and universities have been established but \nprivate  enrolment  is  only  about  1%.  Given  the  tight  fiscal  scenario  and  inability  of  the \nGovernment  to  increase  allocations  significantly,  private  funding  is  needed.  Efforts  are \nnecessary to target public resources to children from poor families at all levels and to make \nfinancing more transparent to improve quality and equity in education. \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2000.
