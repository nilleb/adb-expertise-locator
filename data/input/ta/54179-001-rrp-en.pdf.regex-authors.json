THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Vanuatu for the COVID-19 Fiscal Response Program (the program) under the \nCountercyclical Support Facility's COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO).1  \n  \n2.  Vanuatu has avoided an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through decisive \nearly  action  to  close  borders  and  adopt  prevention  and  containment  measures.  As  of \n12 November  2020,  the  country  had  only  one  confirmed  case  of  COVID-19  contained  in \nquarantine after being identified from a repatriation flight. Vanuatu's efforts to prevent the spread \nof COVID-19 have come at significant economic and social costs. The program will help finance \nthe implementation of the government\u2019s countercyclical response, which is anchored on the \nHealth Preparedness and Response Plan (HPRP) and the Economic Stimulus Program (ESP), \nto mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19. The proposed program is aligned with \nfour operational priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030\u2014(i) addressing \nremaining poverty and addressing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, \n(iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity, and (iv) promoting rural development \nand food security.2 It is also aligned with the Pacific Approach priority of managing risks and \nbuilding resilience by strengthening the health and agriculture sectors.3 Vanuatu meets all the \nCPRO access criteria (Table 1).4  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1. Adverse  After growing by 2.8% annually during 2015\u20132019, Vanuatu\u2019s GDP is likely to contract by 9.8% \nimpact of  in 2020 because of COVID-19-related declines in tourism, remittances, and exports, which are \nexogenous  exacerbated by damages from Cyclone Harold. A fiscal deficit of 6.0% of GDP is expected in \nshocks  2020 driven by lower revenues and higher stimulus spending, after surpluses averaging 6.2% \nannually in 2018\u20132019. The expected current account deficit of 5.8% of GDP in 2020 compares \nwith an average annual surplus of 3.7% in 2015\u20132019. Up to 70% of the 29,000 workers \nemployed in tourism in 2019 could lose their jobs by the end of 2020. It is estimated that the pre-\nCOVID-19 share of the population living below $1.90/day was 13.9% in 2020. This could rise to \n18.3%, with a 10% decline in consumption due to COVID-19.  \n2.  The government is implementing a $44 million countercyclical response focusing on public \nCountercyclical  health and the economy. The HPRP aims to prevent the import of COVID-19 and mitigate \ndevelopment  infection risks while preparing to manage a potential outbreak through detection, isolation, and \nexpenditures  clinical management. The ESP seeks to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and \nbusinesses. It includes employment support, grants and fee relief for MSMEs, and support for \nagricultural production and education to assist poor and vulnerable groups, including women. \nThe ESP is complemented by the distribution of food to needy households. Assistance to \nagriculture will be extended, and MSMEs will have access to credit of up to $90,000 at 1.0% \ninterest to support the economic recovery. \n3. Pre-shock  The government's pre-pandemic macroeconomic management record was generally sound. \nrecord of  The IMF confirms that the economy was growing, prices were stable, fiscal balances were \ngenerally sound  aligned with the economy's cyclical position, and foreign exchange reserves were strong. \nmacroeconomic  Vanuatu's economy grew by 2.9% in 2019 and was forecast to grow at a similar rate in 2020. \nmanagement  Inflation was 2.8% in 2019 and was expected to remain within the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu's \ntarget of 0.0%\u20134.0% in 2020. The fiscal deficit fell from 7.3% of GDP in 2015 when Cyclone Pam \ndamages required reconstruction expenditures. The government reported a fiscal surplus of \n4.9% of GDP in 2019. A fiscal deficit of 1.0% of GDP was expected in 2020 because of lower \nrevenues from its citizenship program. Foreign exchange reserves were equivalent to about 12 \nmonths of imports at the end of 2019 and were expected to remain at similar levels in 2020.  \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Structural  Public health measures were implemented early to prevent COVID-19 from entering Vanuatu \nreforms  and to prepare the health system. Borders were closed on 23 March 2020, and a national state \nof emergency has been in place since 26 March 2020. Repatriation flights commenced after \nestablishing limited testing capacity on 25 May 2020, and, with a single case of COVID-19 \nidentified from the repatriation flights, the system has proven to work well. Hospitals were \nupgraded, medical personnel were trained on infection prevention control and contact tracing, \nand personal protective equipment was distributed to Vila Central Hospital and Northern \nProvincial Hospital. The government intends to maintain and expand public health programs and \nrequested ADB support to prepare for introducing a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes \navailable. Measures to mitigate the pandemic's economic impact were implemented early to \nsupport employment, including 4-month salary-equivalent payments to affected businesses, fee \nrelief for businesses, and grants for MSMEs, followed by education assistance. Support for food \nsecurity is ongoing. Support for credits to MSMEs through a government-owned bank and \nsupport for the agriculture sector will be extended beyond 2020. \n5. Debt  The Joint World Bank\u2013IMF June 2019 DSA found that Vanuatu was at moderate risk of debt \nsustainability  distress. ADB's DSA, updated in October 2020, finds that Vanuatu's short-term growth prospects \ndeteriorated with COVID-19, and countercyclical policy will sharply worsen fiscal balances. \nWhile fiscal deficits put Vanuatu's public debt on a rising path, they will be offset by higher \neconomic growth in the longer term. The government intends to finance fiscal deficits using \ndevelopment partner grants and domestic resources (including drawing down cash reserves). \nThe ADB grant will enable it to prioritize spending on countercyclical measures. The DSA \nconcludes that with ADB grants, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio will remain lower than the threshold \nof 60%, as per Vanuatu's Debt Management Strategy (2019\u20132022) and will be sustainable.  \n6. Coordination  The IMF supports ADB's response and provided an assessment letter. The letter presents the \nwith the IMF  IMF's views on debt sustainability, is consistent with ADB's DSA findings, and reports that \nVanuatu's risk of breaching the debt threshold will be elevated if another disaster occurs. \nADB coordinates macroeconomic monitoring with the IMF, and Vanuatu is on a standard 12-\nmonth Article IV consultation cycle. The country continues to benefit from IMF technical \nassistance  in  areas  including  foreign  exchange  reserve  management,  finance  sector \nsupervision, and national statistics. ADB and the IMF also participate in annual public financial \nmanagement partner meetings and share updates. \nADB = Asia Development Bank; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; DSA = debt sustainability analysis; ESP = Economic \nStimulus Program; GDP = gross domestic product; HPRP = Health Preparedness and Response Plan; IMF = \nInternational Monetary Fund; MSMEs = micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE  \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development context. Vanuatu is a small island developing state, vulnerable to natural \nhazards and global economic shocks. According to the World Risk Index Report, Vanuatu is the \nmost at risk of disasters from natural hazards among 180 economies worldwide.5 It had a \npopulation  of  about  305,000  in  2019  and  is  ranked  141st  of  189  economies  for  human \ndevelopment.6 About 75% of the population lives in rural areas. The main contributors to the \neconomy are tourism and agriculture (crops and livestock). Major exports are beef, cocoa, copra, \nkava, and timber. Vanuatu depends on imported food, fuels, and machinery and equipment. \nThe most recent national data, from 2013, shows that 38.8% of people are multidimensionally \npoor (reflecting deprivations in health, education, and living standards), and another 32.3% are \nvulnerable to multidimensional poverty.7 Modeled estimates of pre-COVID poverty levels put \n13.9% of the population living below $1.90/day.8 \n \n5  Ruhr University. 2019.

Soon after the global outbreak of COVID-19, Vanuatu was hit by \nCyclone Harold on 6\u20137 April 2020.  Cyclone Harold was the most severe storm to strike Vanuatu \nsince Cyclone Pam in 2015. 9 It caused 3 deaths, affected 176,000 people, and damaged homes \nand  infrastructure.  Agricultural  produce  was  destroyed,  reducing  potential  exports  and \njeopardizing food security. Damage and loss from Cyclone Harold are estimated at 51% of GDP \nin 2020. Cyclone Harold compounded the socioeconomic stress caused by COVID-19 as the \ngovernment struggled to manage twin shocks. \n \n5.  Health system challenges. Vanuatu's health system faced significant challenges even \nbefore COVID-19, including shortages of health care workers to deliver services.10 As of June \n2020, more than 50 of 402 health facilities had closed because of inadequate staffing or absence \nof routine maintenance.11 Despite these hurdles, women's health in Vanuatu has improved\u2014\nskilled birth attendance rates are high, at about 90%, and maternal mortality ratios are declining \n(down from 225 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 72 in 2017). However, this remains \nhigher than the Sustainable Development Goal target of 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.12 The \nmajor causes of deaths in Vanuatu are cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and those affected \nby these diseases are susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms.13 Vanuatu has established a \n24-bed isolation capacity and five ventilators in its hospitals to prepare for COVID-19. The country \nhas a minimum 1-month supply of protective equipment, and more than 2,000 personnel were \ntrained in contact tracing and management of COVID-19. Vanuatu has established local testing \ncapacity but needs additional health sector support in the case of a COVID-19 outbreak.  \n \n6.  Prevention and containment measures. The government took proactive actions to \nprevent cases, starting from January 2020. It announced the $6 million HPRP on 24 January 2020 \nto strengthen prevention and containment (para. 17) and protect public health. This included \nissuance of health advisories, health screenings at airports and seaports, and progressive \nrestrictions on international travel as the pandemic evolved\u2014culminating in the closure of borders \non 23 March 2020. A state of emergency was declared on 26 March 2020 and remains in effect \nuntil 31 December 2020. Other measures implemented include social distancing, temporary \nclosure of schools, restrictions on interisland travel, limited passengers on public transport, \ncancellation  of mass  gatherings  and  sporting events,  early closure  of  businesses,  and  an \novernight curfew. Limited testing capacity was established with support from the World Health \nOrganization  (WHO)  and  the  Pacific  Community. 14 The  government  allowed  the  phased \nrepatriation of residents stranded abroad.15 Quarantine processes are in effect for all inbound \ntravelers to limit potential contact with the public. As of 12 November 2020, Vanuatu has only one \nconfirmed case of COVID-19 in border quarantine. The government has since ceased repatriation \nflights and imposed domestic travel restrictions to minimize the risk of community transmission. \n \n9  Government of Vanuatu, National Disaster Management Office. 2020.

The quarantine period is also increased from 14 to 28 days.   \n ", "4 \n \n \n7.  Coordination of responses. The National COVID-19 Taskforce was formed in January \n2020 and merged into the National Disaster Management Office on 26 March 2020. The National \nHealth Emergency Operations Centre under the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been coordinating \nCOVID-19 preparedness activities. The capacity of the operations center was supplemented with \nsupport from development partners such as Australia, France, Israel, the Pacific Community, Red \nCross, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund, and WHO. \nProvincial health emergency operations centers were also set up.  \n \n8.  Pre\u2013COVID-19 record of generally sound macroeconomic management. Vanuatu's \neconomy  experienced  growth  from  2004  to  2019,  driven  by  expanding  tourism,  public \ninvestments, economic reforms, and a stable macroeconomy. Following Cyclone Pam in 2015, \neconomic growth averaged 2.8% during 2015\u20132019, driven by construction and tourism. Inflation \naveraged 2.3% over the same period. While relief and rehabilitation expenditure resulted in a \nfiscal deficit of 7.3% in 2015, this was reduced subsequently, and fiscal surpluses averaging 6.2% \nof GDP were recorded in 2018 and 2019 (Table 2). Fiscal deficits largely related to Cyclone Pam \nreconstruction have led to a rise in public debt from 34.4% of GDP in 2015 to 44.4% of GDP in \n2019. Vanuatu's Debt Management Strategy (2019\u20132022) targets nominal public debt below 60% \nand external debt below 40% of GDP. The strategy targets concessional debt for investment only. \nCurrent account surpluses were recorded in 2018 and 2019, averaging 11.3% of GDP, and \nforeign exchange reserves equaled about 12 months of imports at the end of 2019. The IMF also \nfinds that the economy was growing, prices were stable, the external position was stronger than \nexpected, and public finances were sound.16 Vanuatu was expecting a fiscal deficit in 2020, on \nthe back of declining revenues from the citizenship by investment program, and this had also \nnegatively impacted the expected current account deficit. Nonetheless, the performance was in \nline with the economy's cyclical position.  \n \nTable 2: Selected Macroeconomic Indicators, 2017\u20132021 \n(% of gross domestic product, unless otherwise specified) \n  2017  2018  2019e  2020p  2020p  2021p \nPre\u2013  With  With \nCOVID-19 a  COVID-19  COVID-19 \nReal GDP growth (%)    4.4    2.9    2.9   2.8  (9.8)    1.0 \nInflation (CPI % change)    3.1    2.3    2.8   2.2    3.0    2.2 \nCurrent account balance     (6.1)  10.2  12.4    (5.0)    (5.8)    (9.6) \nTotal revenues and grants    35.6  38.8  42.0  29.2  44.3  37.4 \n  Taxes    17.1  17.8  17.6  18.1  15.4  16.1 \n  Nontax revenues      7.0  12.4  14.0    7.5   16.8b  12.4 \n  Grants    11.4    8.5  10.4    3.5  12.1    8.9 \nTotal expenditures    36.8  31.3  37.1  30.2  50.3  40.4 \nOverall fiscal balance     (1.2)    7.5    4.9    (1.0)    (6.0)    (3.0) \nGross public debt    45.0  45.5  44.4  43.2  55.2  56.4 \n  External debt   35.6  38.2  39.1  38.5   39.9  39.5 \nGross international reserves ($ million)   394  434  512  562  583  681 \nNominal GDP ($ million)   880  915  934  975  852  886 \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPI = consumer price index, e = estimates, GDP = gross domestic production, p = \nprojections. \na Based on Asian Development Outlook Update, September 2019. \nb Revenues from citizenship by investment program increased significantly during first half of 2020. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates and projections, Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, Vanuatu Department of \nFinance and Treasury, and International Monetary Fund. \n \n9.

", "5 \n \njobs.17 Border closures have halted tourism, a source of income in urban and rural areas, and a \nkey generator of foreign exchange and government revenue. Service exports are expected to fall \nby 68% compared with 2019. Tourism is expected to recover gradually, given the economic \nslowdown in the two largest visitor source markets: Australia (52% of visitors) and New Zealand \n(13%). Remittances, estimated by the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) at 13% of GDP in 2019, \nare expected to fall since workers cannot freely travel to Australia and New Zealand, which have \ndedicated labor mobility schemes for the Pacific. More than 10,000 workers from Vanuatu \nparticipate in seasonal work in Australia and New Zealand annually.18 \n \n10.  Economic  impacts.  Vanuatu's  economy  is  expected  to  contract  by  9.8%  in  2020 \n(compared with 2.9% growth in 2019) because of COVID-19 and the impacts of Cyclone Harold. \nOther key macroeconomic variables are expected to worsen in 2020 (Table 2). Vanuatu's \nmerchandise  exports  are  expected  to  fall  by  43%  from  2019  because  of  lower  demand. \nThe current account deficit is forecast at 5.8% of GDP in 2020 (compared with a surplus of 12.4% \nof GDP in 2019) because tourism stopped. Economic growth of 1.0% is expected in 2021, driven \nlargely by a recovery in tourism, agriculture, and post-cyclone construction activities. The duration \nof the COVID-19 crisis poses significant risks to the outlook.  \n \n11.  Fiscal pressures. Declining tourism, combined with lower demand under the COVID-19 \ncontainment measures,  will  result  in  lower  domestic  revenue  in  2020.19 The  government's \ncountercyclical response will further strain the deteriorating fiscal position. The fiscal deficit, \nprojected to reach 6.0% of GDP in 2020 (footnote 19), will be financed by domestic loans and \ndrawdown of cash reserves accumulated from fiscal surpluses in 2018 and 2019. Economic \nrecovery will require substantial resources beyond 2020. A fiscal deficit of 3.0% is projected in \n2021. The government intends to adhere to its debt strategies and maintain public debt below \n60% of GDP (and external debt below 40% of GDP), while the Debt Management Strategy (2019\u2013\n2022) prevents the government from borrowing for operating payments (para. 8). Financing \noptions are, therefore limited. \n \n12.  Increased risks in the finance sector. An extended period of tourism shutdown is likely \nto cause financial difficulties for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) that \noperate in tourism and related industries. About 20% of MSMEs are owned and/or led by \nwomen.20 Failing  MSMEs  and  employment  losses  will  impact  the  commercial  banks'  loan \nperformance and dampen prospects for Vanuatu's economic recovery.21 About 10% of bank loans \nare to the tourism sector, and 55% are for personal loans such as housing mortgages and car \nleases, whose servicing may become challenging. The nonperforming loan ratio was 15.5% in \nMarch 2020, increasing by 1.1 percentage points from September 2019.22 \n \n13.  Significant poverty and social impact. It is estimated that Vanuatu's share of the \npopulation living below $1.90/day could rise from 13.9% (para. 3) to 18.3%, with a 10% decline \nin consumption because of COVID-19 (footnote 6). Poverty is higher in the two major urban \ncenters of Port Vila and Luganville than in rural areas. While those living in rural areas are \nvulnerable to multidimensional poverty, those living in urban areas have had their livelihoods \nimpacted by the collapse in tourism. Tourism, which employed 29,000 formal workers (of whom \n \n17 World Travel and Tourism Council. 2020. Vanuatu: 2020 Annual Research.

While most tourism activities are in urban areas, the lack of demand \nfor agricultural produce from hotels and restaurants affects rural incomes as well. Even before \nCOVID-19, market vendors (of whom about 91% are women) were more vulnerable to poverty \nthan other groups. 24 Interventions to prevent the entry and spread of COVID-19 have already \nresulted in many women losing their livelihoods in the formal and informal sectors (including \nmarket vendors and lower-skilled employees in hotels and restaurants). Strict measures also \nresulted  in  declining  air  and  sea  freight  volumes,  which  restricts  the  availability  of  food. \nThese impacts could reduce assets, increase personal debt burdens, and lower food intake or \nthe quality of intake\u2014with long-term detrimental effects on social welfare.  \n \n14.  Impact of both disasters on health. The co-occurrence of Cyclone Harold and the \nCOVID-19 pandemic made it even more difficult for Vanuatu's health system to overcome the \nimpacts on health and well-being. These include interrupted access to health services, damaged \nmedical equipment such as the immunization cold chain, limited availability of essential medicines \nand equipment because of disrupted supply chains, damaged crops undermining food supply and \nnutrition, and contaminated water sources catalyzing the spread of diseases. Preliminary data \nshow an increase in diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, leptospirosis, typhoid, dengue, \nmalnourishment, skin infections, and an elevated risk of mental illness from evacuation and \nunemployment.25 The gains made in improving women's health are likely to be compromised by \nan outbreak of COVID-19, particularly if funding for essential services is not maintained. The WHO \nCountry Preparedness and Response Status for Vanuatu remains at Level 2 as of June 2020 in \nthe response category \"high risk of imported cases,\" indicating the need for significant support.26 \n \n15.  Gender impacts. In addition to job losses by women (para. 13), COVID-19 will exacerbate \ngender inequalities. The prioritization of COVID-19 responses threatens women's continued \naccess to maternal and reproductive health services, a particular issue in Vanuatu where maternal \nmortality ratios are still relatively high (para. 5).27 Poor access to basic health services, limited \navailability  of  life-saving  emergency  obstetric  care,  inadequate  infrastructure,  difficult \ntransportation, and delayed referrals of life-threatening conditions are major contributing factors. \nThe lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence is high in Vanuatu, with 60% of women \nreporting some form of this. The COVID-19 threat and associated movement restrictions have \nincreased gender-based violence (GBV) while simultaneously making it more difficult for women \nand girls to access services. Data from GBV service providers suggest that already high levels of \nGBV are rising further, and reports of sexual exploitation as a result of economic hardship and \neconomic abuse by partners are increasing.  \n \nB.  Government Responses to COVID-19 \n \n16.  The government's countercyclical response to COVID-19 amounts to 5.2% of GDP, \nfocusing on health since January 2020 and providing economic stimulus since April 2020. \nThe HPRP aims to keep COVID-19 out of Vanuatu and contain it if it does enter.

The initial \nresponse to COVID-19 (paras. 6\u20137) was put in place before a new coalition government assumed \noffice on 20 April 2020. The new administration focused on immediate cyclone relief as well as \nmitigation of COVID-19 impacts. It announced additional components of the countercyclical \nresponse to support economic recovery\u2014$26.7 million support to MSMEs with credit provided \nthrough a government-owned bank beyond 2020 and expanded support to agriculture with a \n$10.6 million program in 2021 targeting agricultural production and employment while ensuring \nthe availability of fresh and nutritious food. The government's countercyclical response to COVID-\n19 will continue until December 2021, and several key measures are already being implemented \n(paras. 17\u201321).  \n \n1.  Health Protection  \n \n17.  The HPRP, implemented by MOH, outlines (i) containment measures to prevent the import \nof cases and interrupt local transmission through quarantine of clusters of sporadic cases; and \n(ii) mitigation measures to prevent community outbreaks through isolation, infection prevention \ncontrol, enhanced contact tracing and surveillance, and risk communication in communities. \nThe  HPRP  adheres  to  the  WHO's  recommended  operational  guidelines  for  COVID-19 \nresponses.28 Of the $6 million health budget, 20% is allocated for infrastructure; 40% for clinical \nmanagement of suspected cases; 23% for coordination, communications, and prevention; and \n17% for early detection and isolation. Personal protective equipment was provided to all health \ncare workers who would tend to COVID-19 patients in Vila Central Hospital and Northern \nProvincial Hospital. More than 2,000 public and health care workers were trained in contact \ntracing to improve surveillance and clinical management of COVID-19. MOH is also intent on \nimproving community awareness through ongoing public information campaigns, including a \ndedicated online information page on key measures to prevent and contain the virus's spread.29 \nHospitals were refurbished, 24 isolation beds were prepared, and local testing capacity was \nestablished. MOH plans to keep expanding laboratory facilities, isolation wards, and refresher \ntraining in the medium- and long-term. Measures to prevent and respond to GBV were also \nintroduced (para. 34). The government intends to maintain and expand public health programs \nand requested ADB support to prepare for the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, once available. \n \n2.  Economic Support \n \n18.  The government's $38 million initial economic support will alleviate the impact of fewer \nemployment opportunities and business activities and provide social protection.30 The ESP \ncomprises the following measures.  \n(i)  Employment stabilization payment\u2014$22.2 million. The government prioritized job \nprotection in recognition of the important role of informal social protection networks, \nwhereby those with paid employment support extended families and communities. \nThe traditional social protection system has been an integral part of Vanuatu's post-\ndisaster relief and recovery efforts. The employment stabilization payment supports \nin  businesses  affected  by  COVID-19.  The  government  reimburses  affected \nbusinesses with up to $260 per employee on their payroll per month for 4 months \n(April\u2013August). As a further incentive to retain employees, employers receive a further \n12% of the amount they are reimbursed for employee wages for contributions to the \nVanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF) and administrative costs. The support was \navailable to all industries affected by COVID-19. The scheme is available to all 7,391 \n \n28 WHO. 2020.

With an \nannual turnover of less than $1.7 million, MSMEs can access a maximum grant of \n$520 to support their operating cash flow requirements. About 450 of 1,500 potential \nrecipients  are  MSMEs  owned  or  co-owned  by  women.  Recipients  also  include \nlicensed holders of small market stalls. The government waived business license fees \nfor 2020 or, if these were paid before 31 March 2020, will waive the fees for 2021. \n(iii)  Agriculture support\u2014$3.5 million. The government will also support increased \nproduction and marketing of copra, kava, cocoa, and other commodities through price \nsubsidies and transportation assistance from farms to urban centers. Price subsidies \nwill supplement the incomes of smallholder farmers and allow larger farmers to \nemploy more workers. About 31,650 households engaged in cash crop production \ncould benefit from this support.33  \n(iv)  Tuition fee grant\u2014$4.5 million. Support for households has primarily been through \nthe exemption of the 2020 tuition fees for early childhood care and education, and \nprimary and secondary education, along with exemptions of several other school \nfees\u201492,644 primary and secondary students (48% girls) will be able to continue \nschooling despite hardships faced by their families. Support for early childhood care \nallows working mothers to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.  \n(v)  Tax and fee exemptions\u2014$4.3 million. Additional measures include (a) rent tax \nexemptions for property owners, (b) road tax exemptions for MSMEs and individuals, \n(c) residence and work permit exemptions to encourage nonresidents to remain in \nVanuatu, and (d) exemptions from other fees and charges applying to MSMEs and \nindividuals. \n \n19.  Support from the finance sector. In addition to the HPRP and ESP support, the RBV \nset up a disaster recovery and import-export facility of up to $10 million to assist exporters and \nimporters. The RBV also reduced official interest rates from 2.90% to 2.25% and the capital \nadequacy ratio from 12% to 10% to align with expansionary fiscal policies. It requires foreign \ncommercial banks to seek prior approval for repatriation of capital as an exchange control \nmeasure. Formal social protection is available to 53% of Vanuatu's workforce through the VNPF, \nincluding those who are informally employed but have registered with the VNPF through voluntary \ncontributions (footnote 34). VNPF members who lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 crisis \ncan access interest-free hardship relief loans up to $850. Commercial banks in Vanuatu also \noffered repayment relief to their customers.  \n \n20.  Other  government-supported,  pro-poor  programs.  Vanuatu  has  no  formal  social \nprotection schemes for those who do not contribute to the VNPF. Still, the government supports \ninternational and local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) that assist the poor and vulnerable. \nThe Department of Agriculture promotes the production of root crops, vegetables, and fish by \nproviding seedlings and fingerlings for backyard gardening and fish farms to ensure affordable \nfood supply.34 The National Disaster Management Office, MOH, and several NGOs distributed \n \n31 Of the workers accessing support, 683 are staff of government-owned enterprises.

Recovery targeted. The initial $3.5 million support for agriculture under the ESP will be \nsupplemented by $10.6 million financing in 2021 for ongoing agricultural assistance programs. \nThis includes targeting partnerships with the private sector to deliver extension services, food \ncrop planting materials, and additional markets; and will also assist mechanization. To further \nboost economic recovery, the government will provide $26.7 million in financing to support lending \nto MSMEs beyond 2020. MSMEs will be able to borrow up to $90,000 at an interest rate of 1.0%.   \n \nC.  Proposed Program, Impact and ADB's Value Addition \n \n22.  Proposed program. ADB's fiscal response program will help the government implement \nits  countercyclical  measures to  mitigate the  adverse  socioeconomic  impacts  of  COVID-19. \nThe program will provide the government with the fiscal space to meet critical public health needs \nwhile managing the effects of the economic downturn on vulnerable groups and businesses. It is \naligned with the following overarching development objective: adverse impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic on the economy, health systems, and social services minimized. The program outcome \nwill be: adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and businesses mitigated. The \nthree program outputs are: (i) health sector responses to COVID-19 implemented; (ii) measures \nfor supporting employment and businesses implemented; and (iii) food security and education \nsupport programs implemented. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n23.  ADB's value addition. The program builds on a strong base of country knowledge and \nrelationships that supported investments in infrastructure, public sector management, and private \nsector development.35 To enhance COVID-19 preparedness, ADB provided test cartridges, \nswabs,  and  other  medical  supplies  totaling  $0.9  million.36 ADB  also  provided  support  for \nquarantine facilities, human resources, and the expansion of isolation facilities.37 A regional health \nproject is strengthening immunization programs and access to quality-assured safe vaccines at \naffordable prices.38 Additional financing of $3.8 million is proposed under the regional health \nproject to upgrade cold chains, strengthen surveillance, and procurement of the COVID-19 \nvaccine, once available. ADB will also support one long-term economic advisor in the Prime \nMinister's office to provide policy advice on economic recovery, and another in the Ministry of \nFinance and Economic Management (MFEM) to strengthen the oversight and monitoring of state-\nowned enterprises.39 Technical assistance is available to support the government in collecting \ngender-based data and monitoring social implications, including the impact on women.40 \n \n \n35 ADB.

The program is complemented by a contingent disaster financing program ($5.0 million \ngrant)  to  strengthen  resilience  to  disasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards  and  future  health \nemergencies.41 In  addition,  an  urban  infrastructure  project  ($9.6 million  grant)  to  construct \nclimate-resilient multipurpose community shelters that can also be used as triage facilities is under \npreparation. 42 ADB will also complement the program with a proposed project ($3.5 million grant) \nto assist informal workers and other vulnerable groups.43 ADB will provide additional financing to \nimprove the connectivity of the outer islands and complement the government's extended support \nfor agriculture.44 Infrastructure projects will play a critical role in stimulating growth and support \nthe recovery from COVID-19. ADB will provide grants and concessional loans for energy access, \nurban infrastructure, and maritime transport during 2020\u20132023.45 \n \n25.  Development partner coordination. Effective development partner coordination has \nenabled sequenced financing and supplementation of government capacity in preparing the \nhealth sector (para. 7). ADB consulted with the World Bank, the IMF, Australia, New Zealand, \nthe European Union, and other development partners on Vanuatu's financing needs and the \ntiming of support. The World Bank, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand provided \nbudget support. Australia and the People's Republic of China contributed essential medical \nequipment and supplies. For the public health response, ADB worked closely with United Nations \nagencies in Vanuatu, including UNICEF and WHO, on technical support for health preparedness \nand  response. 46  The  IMF  provides  advisory  and  technical  support  with  macroeconomic \nassessments and monetary and financial policy advice, which is in addition to staff consultations \nand Article IV requirements. The IMF shares its assessment reports with the ADB. IMF was \nconsulted as the COVID-19 crisis evolved and prepared an assessment letter to confirm that \nVanuatu's macroeconomic policy before COVID-19 had generally been sound and that the \npandemic significantly impacted Vanuatu's economy (footnotes 16 and 22). \n \n26.  Lessons. The proposed program applies lessons from ADB's experience in providing \neconomic  recovery  support  in  the  Pacific  during  the  2008\u20132009  global  financial  crisis. 47 \nEarlier programs demonstrated the need to support aggregate demand while safeguarding the \nfiscal position and the role of development partner coordination  in a comprehensive crisis \nresponse.  ADB's  past  engagement  with  Vanuatu  highlighted  the  need  to  overcome \nimplementation capacity constraints. Accordingly, the new program will use existing government \nmechanisms for program monitoring and implementation. The ESP implementation will rely on \nthe existing database and records of the VNPF and key government agencies to verify potential \nbeneficiaries' eligibility. Tuition fee assistance will use the existing school grant procedures. \nTo supplement the implementation capacity, ADB is mobilizing extensive TA support (para. 23).  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support and Debt Sustainability \n \n27.  Reduced government revenues and higher countercyclical development expenditures will \nlead to a larger financing need in 2020 than initially expected (Table 3). A fiscal deficit of \n$51.1 million (6.0% of GDP) is estimated in 2020, and $26.5 million in 2021 (para. 11). The CPRO \nbudget support is financing 17.4% of the total financing needs for 2020. Other development \npartners have disbursed budget support grants equivalent to $29.0 million in 2020. Domestic \nresources include $12.7 million in domestic debt and use of $38.4 million in cash reserves. It is \n \n41 ADB. 2020. Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 3). Manila. \n42 ADB. 2020.

Vanuatu's public and publicly guaranteed debt was 44.4% of GDP in 2019, of which \ndomestic debt was 5.2% of GDP.49 Vanuatu is considered to be at moderate risk of debt distress \nbased on the IMF's 2019 debt sustainability analysis. A substantial component of the public debt \nwas to finance the post-Cyclone Pam reconstruction activities and infrastructure investments. \nADB's  October  2020  debt  sustainability  analysis  suggests  that  without  grants  from  its \ndevelopment  partners,  the  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  will  breach  the  threshold  of  60%  by  2024. \nHowever,  with  grants,  the  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  will  reach  48.7%  by  2024  and  remain \nsustainable.50 The  government  intends  to  use  development  partner  grants  and  domestic \nresources (including the drawdown of cash reserves) to meet its financing needs in 2020.51 \nThe IMF's September 2020 assessment finds that even though the risk of debt distress remains \nmoderate, risks will be elevated with another disaster (footnotes 16 and 22). \n  \nE.

The MFEM will be the executing agency. \nThe government formed an implementation team to execute, supervise, and monitor compliance \nwith  set  guidelines,  and  ensure  communication  and  information  dissemination  to  potential \nbeneficiaries.  The  implementing  agencies  are  MOH  for  health  measures,  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries and Biosecurity and the Ministry of Education and \nTraining.

Grant proceeds will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n31.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples \nsafeguards. 52  The  actions  were  assessed  and  are  not  expected  to  have  any  adverse \nenvironmental or social safeguard impacts within the meaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n32.  Poverty and social. Despite Vanuatu's lack of formal social protection programs, the \nemployment  stabilization  payments  will  prevent  affected  workers  from  falling  into  poverty. \nThey  will  also  generate  traditional  support  for  those  outside  the  formal  support  schemes. \nAssistance to MSMEs will help them stay in business, including self-employed workers who \ndepend on a single income source, such as market stall owners. Households have been relieved \nof paying school fees, estimated at $290, equivalent to 3 months of household income. Most \nproducers in Vanuatu are smallholder farmers. Support for agriculture will address food security \nand provide income to help meet nonfood essentials such as access to basic services, transport, \nand communication, especially during the pandemic. Support to agriculture will be expanded in \n2021. Transport and logistics are significant constraints and a critical cost component of supply \nchains for cocoa, copra, and other crops. Assistance from the stimulus package will support \nsmallholder farmers to maximize income opportunities from cash crops. Distribution of food and \nhealth supplies to an estimated 55,000 households complements the ESP (para. 20).  \n \n33.  Gender. The program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming.53 The health \nresponse to COVID-19 ensures that (i) health workers in hospitals and subnational laboratories, \nincluding 40% women, receive personal protective equipment; (ii) proactive health messages on \nCOVID-19 and pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding are disseminated widely; (iii) nutrition \nsupplies are provided to 3,000 pregnant and lactating women, and children; and (iv) funding for \nmaternal and reproductive health services will be continued. Also, socioeconomic impacts on \nwomen will be mitigated through support for employment and MSMEs. The ESP also assists \nbusinesses owned by women in retaining employees and supports female employees in \"at risk\" \nindustries. The one-off grant provided to MSMEs will benefit women-owned businesses (about \n18% of all MSMEs), including licensed microentrepreneurs such as market vendors. Public sector \nemployment, where women make up 40% of the workforce, will be maintained. Free tuition was \nintroduced for early childhood education and public schools to reduce hardships and safeguard \nprevious gender gap reductions in education enrollment.  \n \n34.  Finally, measures taken to prevent and respond to GBV include (i) activation of the gender \nand protection subcommittee; (ii) provision of remote GBV services (through a telephone hotline); \n(iii) continued employment of all GBV staff (45 staff in five centers); (iv) upgrade of centers to \ninclude additional handwashing facilities; (v) public campaigns in national newspapers to provide \ninformation on GBV and COVID-19; (vi) activation of \"authorized persons\" to help women access \nservices in rural areas; (vii) police training on GBV and the provision of police rotations to \n \n52 ADB.

A public expenditure and financial accountability self-assessment was \ncompleted in 2015. Subsequently, the MFEM prepared a Public Financial Management Reform \nRoadmap 2017\u20132021. 54 The road map focuses on (i) enhancing controls to ensure compliance \nin procurement, debt management, and payroll management; (ii) adopting medium-term planning \nand budgeting; (iii) strengthening budget accountability; (iv) improving domestic revenue; and (v) \nimproving public investment and asset management. Vanuatu has recently improved its rank from \n71st in 2017 to 64th of 180 economies in 2018 and 2019 in Transparency International's \nCorruption Perception Index.55 Development partners such as Australia and the European Union \nhave supported public financial management improvements in Vanuatu.

Adverse   Vanuatu's economy is forecasted to decline significantly in 2020 as a \n  Impact of  result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its economic growth averaged 2.8% \n  Exogenous  from 2015 to 2019. As of 12 November 2020, the country reported its \n  Shocks  first confirmed case of COVID-19 from a repatriation flight, in border \nquarantine. Although Vanuatu did not have any confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19 until 11 November 2020, border closures have stopped all \nvisitor arrivals since April 2020.  \n \nWith tourism declining significantly and agricultural crops damaged due \nto Cyclone Harold, the economy is forecast to decline by 9.8% in 2020.  \n \nWithout tourism, the government's tax revenues are expected to decline \n\uf0fc  significantly, and combined with higher expenditures related to COVID-\n19, lead to reduced fiscal buffers. A fiscal deficit equivalent to 6.0% of \nGDP is projected in 2020, and a further deficit of 3.0% is projected in \n2021.  \n \nWith higher levels of expenditure and reduced revenue, the government \nrelies on development partner grants and domestic resources (including \ncash reserves to meet financing shortfalls. At the end of 2019, Vanuatu \nhad foreign exchange reserves equivalent to about 12 months of imports. \nGiven their high pre-pandemic levels, foreign exchange reserves are \nexpected to remain adequate despite a decline in tourism and export \nearnings.

This plan focuses on \npreventing the virus from entering the country and getting the country \nready if it enters, particularly the health sector. Increasing preventive \nmeasures have been introduced since late January 2020 through travel \nadvisories, border closures, and quarantine measures. The government \nis  conducting  community  awareness,  strengthening  public  health \n\uf0fc \nsystems, and enhancing preparedness for effective case management \nwhile maintaining essential health services. \n \nThe  $38  million  ESP  includes  revenue  measures  and  several \nexpenditure measures. Approximately 60% of this stimulus package \nconsists of a pro-employment countercyclical expenditure program to \nsupport those likely to lose jobs because of the pandemic. Another 9% \nis allocated to help MSMEs to retain workers. The MSMEs are also \nsupported by revenue exemptions to reduce businesses' operating costs \nto mitigate insolvency.

Pre-shock   The  government  has  a  pre-shock  record  of  generally  sound \n  Record of   macroeconomic management. The economy grew by an average of \n  Generally  2.8% between 2015 and 2019.

Debt  The IMF\u2019s 2019 DSA found that Vanuatu was at moderate risk of debt \nSustainability  distress and could take on more concessional borrowing. Public debt \nremains sustainable, but its rising trend adds to fiscal vulnerabilities.  \n \nADB's DSA, updated in October 2020, finds that Vanuatu's short-term \ngrowth  prospects  have  deteriorated  with  COVID-19  and  that \ncountercyclical policy will sharply deteriorate fiscal balances. The DSA \nfinds that higher fiscal deficits put Vanuatu's public debt on a rising trend, \nwith public debt\u2013GDP projected to rise from 44.4% in 2019 to more than \n55.0% in 2020. The higher fiscal deficit will be partially offset by higher \neconomic  growth  over  the  longer  term.  The  DSA  concludes  that \nVanuatu's  public  debt  level  is  sustainable,  as  most  debt  is  on \nconcessional terms. Without grant support for Vanuatu, public debt is \nlikely to reach unsustainable levels. \n\uf0fc \n \nPublic  external  debt  constitutes  about  70%  of  the  total  debt  stock \noutstanding. It is mostly contracted on concessional terms, which keeps \nborrowing costs low and limits rollover and interest-rate risks. However, \nthe  foreign-currency  denomination  of  the  external  debt  constitutes \ncurrency risk.  \n \nAdditional risks stem from the country's heavy exposure to disasters \ntriggered by natural hazards. Air Vanuatu was financially exposed, and \nthe government was likely to be required to guarantee debt servicing.  \n \nIMF has assessed that Vanuatu remains at moderate risk of debt distress \npost-COVID-19, and risks have been elevated compared to its 2019 \nassessment.  \n6.
