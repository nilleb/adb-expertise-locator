THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the Improving Growth Corridors in Mindanao Road Sector \nProject. \n \n2.  The project will help the Government of the Philippines strengthen economic and physical \nlinkages in Mindanao, which has the highest poverty incidence of the Philippines\u2019 three island \ngroups.  It  will  do  this  by  improving  the  road  transport  network  in  Mindanao  through  the \nimprovement of national roads in Mindanao, financing detailed design for the improvement of \nadditional highways in the future, and strengthening the institutional capacity of the Department \nof Public Works and Highways (DPWH). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The road subsector is the most important transport subsector in the Philippines. The \nnational road network comprises 29,630 kilometers (km), or 14% of the total road network, and \nincludes the main trunk roads, national primary arterial roads, and national secondary roads. An \nefficient road transport subsector is crucial for the Philippines\u2019 economic growth and poverty \nreduction. Despite its importance to the national economy, the road subsector has not received \nadequate funding. Expansion or improvement of the network has not kept pace with population \ngrowth,  and  many  roads  deteriorate  prematurely  because  of  inadequate  maintenance. \nGovernment funding for the road network has been increasing in recent years. However, about \n23% of the national road network is in poor condition and in need of rehabilitation. This contributes \nto the rising number of road accidents in the Philippines. The increasing impact of climate change, \nparticularly flooding, is having a negative effect on the road network. Mindanao\u2019s road network is \nless developed than the national network. While 82% of the national roads in Luzon and 89% in \nVisayas are paved, only 70% of the national roads in Mindanao are paved. \n \n4.  Mindanao is the second largest island in the Philippines, with a population of more than \n20 million people. Despite being rich in natural resources, Mindanao has the highest poverty \nincidence of the Philippines\u2019 three island groups (Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao), with a rate of \n36.2%.1 This is largely because of civil conflict and low economic growth. Despite significant \ndevelopment  in  recent  years,  a  number  of  infrastructure  targets  in  the  government\u2019s \nMindanao 2000 plan were not achieved because of the lack of coherent plans, inadequate \ngovernment financial resources, and underinvestment, especially by the private sector due to \nperceptions of the civil conflict.2 The government, Japan International Cooperation Agency, the \nWorld Bank, and the Australian Agency for International Development have completed or are \nimplementing national or provincial road improvement projects in Mindanao. However, a large \npart of the road network in Mindanao remains in need of improvement. \n \n5.  The transport sector is governed by the National Transport Policy, which was approved in \nJune 2017. The policy focuses on (i) resource generation and allocation; (ii) criteria for the \npreparation  of  agency  plans,  programs,  and  projects;  (iii)  cost  recovery;  (iv)  regulation  of \npassenger transport; (v) urban transport; (vi) transport logistics; and (vii) governance. The sector \n                                                \n1  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

", "2 \ndevelopment plan is set forth in the Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022 (footnote 1). \nInstitutional  capacity  of  the  DPWH  has  improved  significantly  over  the  last  decade,  with \nassistance provided by ADB and other development partners. However, capacity development is \na long-term process, and additional improvement is needed, particularly in regional offices. \n \n6.  Mindanao  plays  a  key  role  in  the  Philippines\u2019  participation  in  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives. It comprises most of the Philippine territory in the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013\nMalaysia\u2013Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) Greater Sulu Sulawesi Corridor.3 \nThe project is aligned with Strategic Pillar I (Enhancing connectivity within BIMP-EAGA as well \nas with other regions outside of BIMP-EAGA) of the BIMP-EAGA Implementation Blueprint, 2012\u2013\n2016.4 Improving roads in Mindanao will support the development of agribusiness, ecotourism, \nand logistics, contributing to the development of the Greater Sulu Sulawesi Corridor. \n \n7.  The project supports the government\u2019s priorities for improvement of the country\u2019s road \nnetwork and development of Mindanao (footnote 1). It also supports the key objective of ADB\u2019s \nstrategy for the Philippines of helping the country achieve high, inclusive, and sustainable growth.6 \nThe project is consistent with the midterm review of ADB Strategy 2020 through its focus on \nimproving the delivery of infrastructure services as well as investing in physical assets.7 It \nsupports regional cooperation and integration by contributing to the implementation of the ASEAN \nHighway  and  BIMP-EAGA  Priority  Infrastructure  Projects.  It  supports  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nTransport Initiative8 by addressing climate change and road safety, and is included in ADB\u2019s \nPhilippines Transport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map.9 \n \n8.  Lessons learned. ADB approved the Road Improvement and Institutional Development \nProject in December 2011.10 The project includes periodic maintenance of about 340 km of \nnational roads in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao; institutional capacity development for the \nDPWH; and consulting services for project supervision and preparation of detailed engineering \ndesign  for  future  projects.  The  primary  lesson  learned  from  the  Road  Improvement  and \nInstitutional Development Project is the risk of delays in procurement, which were caused by the \nDPWH\u2019s lack of familiarity with ADB procedures and weak capacity. The capacity of the DPWH \nregional and district offices involved in implementation will be strengthened under the project. \nTraining on procurement for the DPWH staff will also be conducted. ADB conducted a project \nprocurement-related review (PPRR) of the project in 2015.11 The PPRR concluded that the \nDPWH and the Unified Project Management Office (UPMO) had established a reasonably \neffective control environment, which generally provided assurance that the project procurement, \nfinancial management, and contract implementation adhere to the relevant policies, guidelines, \nand loan agreement. The PPRR, however, identified two issues that would not prevent the \naccomplishment of project objectives, but might result in financial loss should they recur: (i) the \nneed  for  improved  quality  of  evaluation  of  bids,  and  (ii)  noncompliance  with  the  bid  and \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2017.

The recommendations will be addressed in \nprocurement under the project. \n \n9.  Special features and value addition. The project has several special features. The \ndesign  of the  project  roads  will  include  climate  change  adaptation measures  incorporating \nstructural  and  nonstructural  features.  To  facilitate  public  participation  in  strengthening \ngovernance, all project roads will be geotagged with information accessible to the public on the \ninternet.12 Community awareness campaigns will be conducted to improve road safety on the \nproject roads. ADB\u2019s financing adds significant value to the project. The use of ADB\u2019s sector loan \nmodality allows the government to concentrate road improvement activities in Mindanao and \nprovides flexibility in determining the most appropriate location for subprojects, given changing \npolitical and security conditions in Mindanao. ADB\u2019s leadership in promoting regional cooperation \nand integration in Southeast Asia will facilitate Mindanao\u2019s realization of regional as well as \nnational benefits. The project will support other initiatives promoting growth in Mindanao. The \nthree core subprojects will help link the mariculture and trade cluster in western Mindanao with \nthe four other Mindanao development clusters being promoted by the Mindanao Development \nAuthority.13 The project will also contribute to and benefit from the development of the BIMP-\nEAGA Greater Sulu Sulawesi Corridor (footnote 3), which encompasses Mindanao. ADB has a \nlongstanding and ongoing relationship with the DPWH, which covers improvement of physical \ninfrastructure as well as strengthening institutional capacity. This productive relationship will \ngreatly facilitate project implementation.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: strengthened economic and physical \nlinkages in Mindanao.14 The project will have the following outcome: improved efficiency and \nsafety of selected sections of the road transport network in Mindanao.15 \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  Output 1: Selected sections of road transport network in Mindanao improved. The \nproject will improve an estimated 280 km of national primary, secondary, and tertiary roads and \nbridges in Mindanao. The improvements will include paving earth roads, replacing damaged road \nsections, widening existing roads, adding surface overlays, and replacing and strengthening \nbridges. The project roads will be designed with features to strengthen resilience to climate change. \nAmong the structural and nonstructural features included are elevated pavement levels, enhanced \nslope protection, and improved maintenance of drainage structures. Road safety on these roads \nwill be improved through road safety community awareness campaigns. Three core roads located \non the Zamboanga peninsula in western Mindanao (Region IX), with a total length of 78 km, have \nbeen appraised for inclusion in the project.16 Consultants for the ongoing ADB-funded project \n(footnote 10) prepared the detailed design for the core roads, and will prepare the detailed design \nfor the non-core roads. The government will propose additional roads, which will have to meet the \n                                                \n12 Geotagging provides the exact location of a road using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and, when \nlinked with DPWH institutional monitoring systems, it provides a mechanism to monitor road investment projects \nthroughout the project life cycle, including procurement and construction. \n13 Mindanao  Development  Authority.  2014.

Output 2: Detailed engineering design for improvement of roads in other projects \ncompleted. The project will finance detailed design drawings and bills of quantities for the \nimprovement of 300 km of national highways in Mindanao, to be improved under other projects. \nThe government will determine the roads for which the detailed design will be prepared. The \ndesign will incorporate features to strengthen resilience to climate change. \n \n13.  Output 3: Institutional capacity of the Department of Public Works and Highways in \nmultiyear planning, fiscal accountability, and human resource management strengthened. \nThe project will improve the institutional capacity of the DPWH to make management of the \ntransport sector more efficient and contribute to improved operations of the transport sector in \nMindanao and nationwide. Strengthening of the DPWH\u2019s institutional capacity will take place in \nregional offices and at headquarters. Training in multiyear planning will be carried out exclusively \nin the DPWH regional offices, while the new human resources database system integrating all \nDPWH operations will be made operational in all DPWH offices. Making the new online system \nfor budgeting and fiscal monitoring operational, and the provision of support in supervising \nregional planning, will take place at the DPWH headquarters. To ensure the sustainability of the \ninvestment in the new systems, the project will provide operational training to the DPWH staff. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $503 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).17 \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $380 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period \nof 7 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and \nother charges during implementation to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average \nmaturity is 18.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year.  \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

Use  of  the  sector  loan  will  enable  the  government  to  achieve  inclusive  economic \ndevelopment by concentrating road improvement subprojects in Mindanao; and will provide \nflexibility in determining the most appropriate location for subprojects, given the changing political \nand security conditions in Mindanao. The project meets all the requirements for a sector loan:17 \n(i) the government has a sector development plan and the institutional capacity to implement it, \n(ii) its policies applicable to the sector are appropriate, and (iii) the DPWH has demonstrated \ncapacity. \n \n16.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \ncivil works, project implementation consultants, and capacity development. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  380.0  75.5 \nGovernment of the Philippines  123.0  24.5 \nTotal  503.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17.

The existing UPMO will be directly \nresponsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  project.  The  DPWH  and  UPMO  are \nimplementing the ongoing ADB-financed road project, and have a sound understanding of ADB \npolicies  and  procedures.  The  project  director  will  work  full-time  on  the  project,  under  the \nsupervision of the UPMO director, and will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the \nproject. The environment and social services division of the DPWH will be responsible for \nimplementation of the environmental and social aspects of the project. Additional financing by \nADB may be considered if the project performs well. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2018\u2013December 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Department of Public Works and Highways \nUnified Project Management Office \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies \nRoads Management Cluster II (multilateral) \n(iii) Implementation unit  Manila, 15 staff  \nInternational \nProcurement  12 contracts  $299.7 million \ncompetitive bidding \nQuality- and cost- 3,900 person-\nConsulting services  $43 million \nbased selection  months \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1999.

The DPWH has taken actions to ensure a high degree of project readiness. The detailed \ndesign for the three core subprojects has been completed, and bidding documents will be issued \nbefore loan effectivity. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The  project\u2019s technical viability  has  been  confirmed  through  the  project preparatory \ntechnical assistance. The detailed design for the three core roads has been completed. The \ndesign is for two-lane 6.7-meter wide concrete roads, which meet DPWH technical criteria and \nare based on proven construction technology in Mindanao. Adaptation measures related to \nelevation of pavement, slope protection, and maintenance practices have been incorporated in \nthe project design to reduce climate change risks. Based on the Preliminary Climate Risk \nScreening Checklist, the subproject road is in the medium risk category. Potential impacts caused \nby floods, landslides, and the increase in precipitation were considered during project preparation. \nCorresponding  adaptation  measures  have  been  formulated  as  part  of  the  climate  change \nassessment carried out for the project.19 Among the structural and nonstructural adaptation \nmeasures included in the road designs and project cost estimates are increased pavement \nelevation levels, enhanced slope protection, and intensified maintenance of drainage structures. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic. The three core project roads are economically viable. The project will improve \nthe condition of these roads by replacing the gravel surface with a concrete pavement. Three \nmain benefits were identified and estimated for inclusion in the project\u2019s economic viability \nassessment: (i) reduced vehicle operating costs, (ii) savings from reduced transport time, and (iii) \ngenerated traffic. The economic internal rate of return of the three core project roads ranges from \n10.4% to 19.1%, and the net present value ranges from $2.0 million to $37.0 million. In addition \nto  quantified  benefits,  communities  in  the  areas  of  influence  will  benefit  indirectly  through \nimproved connectivity with better access to markets, economic opportunities, and government \nand other social services such as education and health.  \n \n22.  Financial. Financial analysis shows that the funding for maintenance of national roads in \nthe Philippines has increased significantly since 2010. Funding for routine maintenance increased \nat an average annual growth rate of about 25% from 2010 to 2017. Funding for more intensive \nmaintenance and rehabilitation, reconstruction, and upgrading of national roads stayed at about \nthe same level in 2017 as 2011; however, funding for these activities increased at an average \nannual growth rate of about 16% from 2015 to 2017. Maintenance of the improved project roads \n                                                \n19 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nwith their concrete pavement will be less expensive than maintenance of the roads with their \ncurrent gravel surface. Based on the trend of increasing funding for maintenance of national roads \nand the lower funding requirement for maintaining the improved project roads, it is considered \nreasonable to expect that the government will provide sufficient financing for the maintenance of \nthe project roads and that the project is financially sustainable. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the  DPWH  confirmed  that  the  financial \nmanagement risk is substantial and that the DPWH has sufficient capacity to manage and \nmaintain the accounting systems, financial controls, and audit arrangements required for the \nproject. High risks are related to the use of advance account procedures and financial reporting. \nThe DPWH does not have experience using advance account procedures (formerly known as \nimprest account procedures) and will require training and guidance in their proper use. ADB will \nprovide consultant support to mitigate these risks and build capacity by making financial and \nmanagement systems operational and training staff in their use.  Other risks are assessed \nmoderate to low. The DPWH\u2019s financial accounting, auditing rules, and internal control systems \nfollow generally accepted international accounting and auditing practices. The DPWH follows the \nPhilippine  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards,  which  have  been  harmonized  with  the \nInternational  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards. The  Commission  on  Audit,  which  is  the \nSupreme Audit Institution, follows the Philippine Public Sector Standards on Auditing, which are \nin  harmony  with  the  International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions framework  of \nprofessional standards. The DPWH maintains separate project records and accounts to identify \nthe works, goods, and services financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, \nexpenditures incurred for the project, and use of counterpart funds, including adequate internal \ncontrols and financial reporting arrangements. The Commission on Audit will audit the project \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  annually.  To  facilitate  public  participation  in \nstrengthening governance, all project roads will be geotagged with information accessible to the \npublic on the internet through the DPWH\u2019s project and contract management application system. \n \n24.  ADB and the government will undertake a number measures to improve DPWH\u2019s financial \nmanagement capacity under the proposed and ongoing projects. The project will improve the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  DPWH  by  making  operational  DPWH\u2019s  new  online  system  for \nbudgeting  and  fiscal  monitoring  and  providing  operational  training,  A  national  financial \nmanagement expert will be engaged to assist the DPWH during the first 5 years of project \nimplementation. The TA for Strengthening Infrastructure Capacity and Innovation for Inclusive \nGrowth will assist DPWH and other agencies to improve project management and monitoring \nusing international best practices and experts in the areas of project management. 20 The Road \nImprovement and Institutional Development Project (footnote 10) is strengthening DPWH\u2019s fiscal \naccountability by financing the completion of the implementation of the financial information \nmanagement system and business process reengineering in DPWH. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the government  and  the  DPWH. The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \n                                                \n20  ADB. 2017.

The project is a general intervention with indirect poverty reduction impacts. It was subject \nto social assessment using meaningful consultation as a key strategy to incorporate issues, \nconcerns, voices, and participation of stakeholders in the project preparation, implementation, \nmonitoring, and reporting. Potential benefits and positive impacts and anticipated adverse impacts \nwere identified during consultations and the social assessment. To mitigate potential adverse \nimpacts, required key actions have been prepared under the various project components. The \nproject is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Gender issues cover a range of concerns \nincluding livelihood, abuse, and trafficking of women and children. While the project outcome does \nnot specifically address gender equality, project outputs are designed to deliver benefits to women \nby  directly  improving  their  access  to  social  services,  economic  or  financial  resources  or \nopportunities, and basic infrastructure. A gender action plan 21 has been prepared and a gender \nstrategy is incorporated in the resettlement and indigenous peoples framework (RIPF)22 and \nensuing plans. The gender action plan has several targets concerning the participation of women \nin the project. At least 50% of road safety community facilitators will be women. Women will \ncomprise 25% of the participants in the training in multiyear planning carried out in 13 DPWH \nregional offices. Women will comprise at least 25% of participants in the support in supervising \nregional planning provided to the DPWH headquarters. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n28.  Environment (category B). The project is classified category B for environment. An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework24 has been prepared to ensure that subprojects \nto be prepared during implementation comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nPhilippine laws. The 17 km core subproject (Tampilisan\u2013Sandayong Road) in Zamboanga del \nNorte does not pass through environmentally sensitive areas, and about 90% of land use along \nthe road is agricultural/cropland. Results of the initial environmental examination (IEE)25 showed \nthat the proposed road improvement works will not cause significant adverse environmental \nimpacts.  Anticipated  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  have  been  assessed,  and \nmitigation  measures  have  been  formulated  to  reduce  these  to  acceptable  levels.  The \nenvironmental management plan will be incorporated in civil works contracts to guide the DPWH, \nthe supervision consultant, and contractors in managing, monitoring, and reporting environmental \nimpact mitigation and compliance. The DPWH has an Environmental and Social Services Division \nstaffed  with  environmental  specialists  experienced  in  implementing  ADB  projects.  Public \nconsultations were conducted during IEE preparation, involving stakeholders such as local \nresidents and representatives from the local government units, women\u2019s organizations, and the \nbusiness sector. A grievance redress mechanism has been formulated and will be implemented \nto facilitate resolution of project-related environmental impacts. The environmental assessment \nand review framework and the IEE have been disclosed on the ADB website. The IEEs for the \nother two core subprojects are under preparation. \n \n                                                \n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB.

Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will involve road improvements to \ninclude widening, realignment, and slope protection that will require land acquisition. Land \nacquisition will trigger physical and economic displacement within the 30-meter road right-of-way \n(ROW). Temporary loss or disruption of land use or other assets during construction work, \nparticularly the movement of construction materials to and from work sites, is also expected. \nResettlement impacts on indigenous peoples are also anticipated. A RIPF has been prepared for \nthe sector project to cover the core and non-core subprojects. A resettlement and indigenous \npeoples plan (RIPP)26 has been prepared for one of the core subprojects, the Tampilisan\u2013\nSandayong road, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. This subproject will \nentail  land  acquisition  for  the  ROW  resulting  in  415  potentially  affected  households,  with \n78 affected households deemed for relocation. The plan will ensure measures for affected \nhouseholds to assist them in maintaining, if not improving, their socioeconomic pre-project \nconditions.  Measures  in  the  plan  include  procedures  for  stakeholder  engagement  through \nmeaningful consultation and participation as well as timely information disclosure, grievance \nredress mechanisms, institutional arrangements, capacity building, and the necessary budgetary \nallocation for plan implementation. All these measures have been disclosed to the affected \nhouseholds through consultation and dissemination of public information booklets, consistent with \na harmonization of Philippine laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Specific arrangements \nfor compensation of APs, to be coordinated by the DPWH and partner agencies, include (i) job \nplacement or temporary work during construction, (ii) social services and nutritional programs, (iii) \nvocational  skills  training,  (iv)  an  agricultural  enhancement  program,  and  (v)  linkages  to \ncooperatives to facilitate economic support. The RIPP and RIPF have been uploaded on the ADB \nwebsite. The RIPPs for the other two core subprojects are in an advanced state of preparation. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category A). Indigenous peoples are present in the project area \nfor the core roads on the Zamboanga Peninsula, and largely belong to the Subanen, lranun, \nSamal, Maguindanaon, Tausug, Yakan, Maranao, and Kalibugan indigenous peoples groups. \nThe RIPF upholds the conditionalities for broad community support (BCS) and will seek the \nconsent of affected indigenous peoples communities through the certificate precondition/free prior \ninformed consent process as embodied under the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, 1997. For \nMuslims as indigenous peoples, BCS will be observed through the provincial local government \nunit.27 For a project component or subproject requiring BCS, the lack or absence of BCS will make \nthe subproject ineligible for loan proceeds. The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples \n(NCIP) is assessing the Tampilisan\u2013Sandayong road for issuance of the certificate precondition \nas provided in the RIPF.28 Under the Tampilisan\u2013Sandayong road subproject, land acquisition for \nthe  new  ROW  will  trigger  physical  and  economic  displacement.  Among  the  415  affected \nhouseholds, 24 are indigenous peoples (23 Subanen and 1 Kolibugan). The generalized culture \nis lowland central Philippines focused on wet rice cultivation, and some localized swidden \ncultivation. Project encroachment on ancestral domains will be avoided as traditional/customary \nmodalities of livelihood systems are preserved in these areas. However, other culture traits \nexhibited beyond the domain may be at risk, such as agroforestry systems/home gardens as food \nproduction systems. Positive and negative impacts resulting from the project are addressed in a \ncombined RIPP anchored on the RIPF that embodies measures for meaningful consultation and \nparticipation as well as timely information disclosure, grievance redress mechanisms, institutional \narrangements, capacity building, and the necessary budgetary allocation for plan implementation.  \n                                                \n26 Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Organic Act of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (RA 9054, 2001). \n28 The NCIP has constituted the field-based investigation team, and prepared the work and financial plan in May 2017, \ntogether with the authorized DPWH representatives.
