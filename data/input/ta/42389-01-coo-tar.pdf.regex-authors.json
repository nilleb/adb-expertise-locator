INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Cook Islands requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  conduct  an  assessment  of  the  country\u2019s  public  service.  The \nassessment was undertaken in November 2009 under the TA for Public Sector Review and \nImprovement approved on 16 October 2008 for $240,000. The outcome of the assessment was \na comprehensive approach to support implementation of the recommendations to improve the \nefficiency of the public sector in the Cook Islands.  \n \n2.  The assessment was based on a review of (i) the current macroeconomic situation; \n(ii) the legal and regulatory environment including the Public Service Commission (PSC) Act, \n2009; the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management Act, 1995-96; the Public Expenditure \nReview Committee and Audit Act, 1995-96; and the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act, \n1998; among others; (iii) established public service management processes, procedures, and \npolicies; and (iv) past studies on public sector-related issues. Consultations were also held with \nkey stakeholders in government and the community. The findings of the assessment were \nreviewed  with  the  National  Sustainable  Development  Committee  (NSDC) 1 and  relevant \ngovernment stakeholders. \n \n3.  An ADB fact-finding mission was conducted in March 2010 to reach an understanding \nwith  the  government  on  the  objectives  and  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and the detailed terms of reference for consulting services of the \nproposed policy and advisory TA. The TA has been included in the TA program for 2010 in \nADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2010\u201320122 and  is  consistent  with  the  strategic \nobjectives of The Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014.3 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The Cook Islands undertook a major public sector and economic reform in 1995\u20131996 \nbecause of a financial crisis that had its roots in an expanding public sector, a limited private \nsector resource base, and a rapidly increasing debt burden. The number of ministries and civil \nservice personnel was reduced by about one third. Debt was restructured, with ADB playing the \nrole of \u201chonest broker,\u201d and legislation designed to ensure better public financial management \n(para. 2) was adopted. The resultant growth dividend saw average growth of 6% gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) per annum from 1999 to 2004. However, more recently, minimal infrastructure \ninvestment (in part influenced by the need to bring debt back under control), the impact of \nseveral cyclones, high inflation, and the global economic crisis have resulted in economic \ncontraction.   \n \n5.  The government recognizes that a renewed public sector reform program is essential to \nturn around this economic situation. Raising performance and productivity\u2014vital for achieving \nthe needed large capital investment program\u2014is the focus. In FY2010, the cabinet imposed a \n2% expenditure cut, mainly in operations. Personnel costs and numbers remained about the \nsame and personnel expenditure is expected to reach 45% of total revenue in FY2011. This \n                                                \n1  The NSDC comprises the chief of staff (chair); financial secretary; public service commissioner; solicitor general \u2013 \nCrown Law; secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and manager, Aid Management Division, Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Management. The secretariat is provided by the Office of the Prime Minister. \n2  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Cook Islands, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2009. ADB\u2019s Approach to Assisting the Pacific (2010\u20132014). Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 April 2010. \n ", "2   \nincrease has eroded some of the reductions accrued during 1995\u20132000. Revisions to the Manila \nAgreement5 financial ratios have been approved as a policy action under ADB\u2019s Economic \nRecovery Support Program.6 This commits the government to the following: (i) tax revenue \nshould not exceed 25% of GDP unless it is due to better compliance and efficiency, (ii) public \nsector wages and salaries should be 44% of total revenue and are to be reduced to 40% in the \nout-years, (iii) debt servicing should not exceed 5% of total revenue, (iv) the overall deficit \nshould not exceed 2% of GDP, and (v) net debt should not exceed 35% of GDP. \n \n6.  Prior to the 1995\u20131996 reforms, government personnel numbered 3,200. This reduced \nsignificantly to 1,868 in 1996 and continued to decline to 1,866 in 2006 and 1,792 in 2009. \nDespite  this,  the  public  service  grew  as  a  portion  of  the  total  workforce  to  18%  in  2006 \ncompared to 16% in 1996. The ratio of population per public sector employee decreased from \n9.7 in 1996 to 7.4 in 2006 as the population declined due to out-migration. Public sector costs \nand personnel increases are made more affordable by the increased number of tourists to help \nfinance the size and scope of public services (tourist numbers have more than doubled since \nthe mid-1990s to reach about 100,000 per year).  \n  \n7.  There has been no review of the size, structure, and functions of the public service since \ndecentralization  during  the  1995\u20131996  reforms.  According  to  the  findings  of  the  2009 \nassessment,  various  entities  have  arisen  on  a  needs  basis\u2014resulting  in  segmented \nmanagement, accountability, and performance structures. In addition:  \n(i)  Outer island administration and activities were devolved to the outer islands \nunder the Ministry of Outer Island Development during the reforms. However, in \n1998, police, justice, health, and education services were recentralized to the \nRarotonga-based ministries resulting in dispersed planning and accountability in \nouter island development.  \n(ii)  There  is  a  lack  of  synchronization  between  existing  planning,  management, \nfinancing,  implementation,  and  monitoring  activities;  and  a  lack  of  linkages \nbetween budget monitoring and performance monitoring.  \n(iii)  The  absence  of  a  public  administrative  manual  for the  whole  public  service \nmeans  that  the  advice  given  on  public  service  policies,  operations,  and \nprocesses is ad hoc and piecemeal\u2014prompting ministries to develop their own \nmanuals, which results in inconsistencies between ministries. \n \n8.  Efforts to improve public sector performance in terms of improving planning capacities \ninclude the adoption of the National Sustainable Development Plan, 2007\u20132010 (NSDP); the \nconduct of sector and multiyear planning tied to the annual budget process; establishment of \nperformance contracts and plans with heads of ministries and island administrators; and the \ndevelopment of a medium-term budget framework (MTBF). The government has started public \nadministration  reform  by  improving  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment  and  adopting  a \nperformance  management  approach.  More  is  to  be  done  to  ensure  full  implementation  of \nlegislation,  strengthening  coordination  between  the  central  agencies,  and  expanding  the \n                                                \n5  The 1998 Manila Agreement was signed between the governments of Italy, Nauru, and New Zealand to facilitate \nrestructuring of the unsuccessful commercial ventures made by the Government of the Cook Islands in the early \n1990s which resulted in a fiscal crisis at the time. \n6  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster \nand Loan for Subprogram 1 to the Cook Islands for the Economic Recovery Support Program. Manila (Loan 2565-\nCOO, approved on 13 October, for $10 million). \n ", "  3 \ncoverage  of  the  PSC  Act,  2009  to  crown  agencies,7 especially  in  terms  of  performance \nmanagement oversight and accountability. \n \n9.  The government needs to be of a size that is affordable, efficient, accountable, and \nresponsive to its medium-term objectives. Given recent and current revenue streams and a \ngrowing budget deficit, it is questionable if the size of the public service is affordable. Citizens, \nincluding the private sector, are questioning whether such increases have contributed to more \neffective and efficient service delivery. There is a common public belief that the reform attitude \nresulting from the 1995\u20131996 efforts has dissipated.  \n \n10.  The tight current and expected future fiscal situation makes apparent the need for a \nmore measured approach to avoid the crisis-driven changes of 1995\u20131996. If public sector \nreform is not addressed in a stepwise comprehensive manner, the country may confront a \nsimilar situation as in the mid-1990s and be forced to make drastic changes that may result in \nsevere out-migration.  \n \n11.  Given the fiscal environment, changes in the country\u2019s socioeconomic makeup, and \nmore emphasis on performance management and medium-term budgeting, it is timely to look \nagain at the size, scope, and performance of the government. The public service assessment \nconducted under the TA for Public Sector Review and Improvement found that there is a need \nto review the size of the public sector and align its structure and scope to national priorities, \nadvance performance management government-wide, and initiate an enabling environment for \nenforcing comprehensive public service regulations and policies.  \n \n12.  The  public  service  assessment made  the following recommendations:  (i)  conduct  a \ngovernment-wide functional analysis to redefine the government\u2019s size and scope; (ii) include \ncrown agencies under the performance elements of the PSC Act, 2009; (iii) address outer island \nadministration in terms of improving service delivery in an accountable manner; (iv) improve \nperformance management so there is more collaboration between ministries and agencies and \nsimplified planning and monitoring process in line with the annual budget, and eventually the \nMTBF and linked to the NSDP; (v) develop a performance-oriented framework for state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) and assess the rationalization prospects of these and other government \ncommercial activities; (vi) develop a public service policies, standards, and guidelines manual, \nand  review  and  improve  the  remuneration  process;  and  (vii)  provide  ongoing  public \nadministration training. The assessment\u2019s recommendations should be implemented in a staged \napproach in keeping with government capacities and available resources. The proposed TA will \ncover public administration reform aspects, while the rationalization of SOEs will be addressed \nseparately. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The expected impact of the policy and advisory TA will be a government structure that is \ncost-effective  and  aligned  to  national  priorities.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  policy  and \nadvisory TA will be a set of options for priority public administration reforms made available to \nthe government. \n                                                \n7  Crown agencies include three central oversight offices (Audit Office, Ombudsman, and Crown Law Office) and \nothers that are supported by their own legislation and do not fall under the PSC Act except for Section 8 regarding \nsome employment policies and standards. The Cooks Islands currently has 14 ministries and 13 crown agencies. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The policy and advisory TA will (i) conduct a government-wide functional analysis to \nredefine government\u2019s size and scope; (ii) review how to include crown agencies under the \nperformance elements of the PSC Act, 2009; (iii) address outer island administration in terms of \nimproving service delivery in an accountable manner; (iv) improve performance management for \nmore collaboration between ministries and agencies and a simplified planning and monitoring \nprocess in line with the annual budget and eventually the MTBF and linked to the NSDP; and (v) \ndevelop  a  public  service  policies,  standards,  and  guidelines  manual.  It  will  support  the \nadjustments  the  PSC  is  making  to  achieve  its  mandate  and  the  regulatory  framework, \nprocesses, and procedures in place to advance public sector management and performance.  \n \n15.  The TA outputs include (i) a functional analysis of government agencies completed and \nadopted; (ii) central government agencies (PSC, Office of the Prime Minister [OPM], and the \nMinistry of Finance and Economic Management [MFEM]) implement a coordinated planning, \nmanagement, and monitoring system; and (iii) a public administrative manual enabling the PSC \nto enforce regulations submitted for approval.  \n \n16.  Review size of the public sector to align national priorities. The TA will support a \nfunctional  analysis  of  the  public  service  including  outer  island  administrations  and  crown \nagencies. It will also help identify services that can be more efficiently and effectively provided \nby the private sector. The TA will support the preparation of a costed redundancy program for \npotential displaced public servants as a result of the proposed functional analysis. The TA will \nassist  in generating the  needed  political  and  public  understanding  of the  rationale for  the \nrecommended changes. The NSDC will provide oversight for the functional analysis to include \nministries, departments, and crown agencies (not SOEs). A secretariat, with PSC coordinating, \nwill also be formed consisting of PSC, MFEM, and OPM representatives to support the work of \nthe international and local counterpart team. \n \n17.  Advancing  performance  management  government-wide.  The  TA  will  support \n(i) consolidating,  aligning,  and  simplifying  the  current  different  planning,  management,  and \nmonitoring systems with the NSDP and MTBF; and (ii) strengthening the collaboration between \nthe  central  agencies  (PSC,  MFEM,  and  OPM)  so  that  performance-oriented  planning  and \nmonitoring  is  done  in  an  efficient  manner  using  the  human  resources  available  and  not \noverburdening ministries and agencies. \n \n18.  Initiating an enabling environment for enforcing comprehensive public service \nregulations  and  policies. The TA will advance the preparation of standard public service \nadministration policies across government to be submitted for approval and adoption. It will \nassist the PSC to produce a single operations manual consisting of a set of public service \npolicies, standards, and guidelines in a consolidated manner for all ministries and agencies.  \n \n19.  It is envisaged that the implementation of the recommendations delivered under this TA \nwill be carried out under separate follow-on TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the policy and advisory TA is estimated at $375,000 equivalent, of \nwhich $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and \nadministered by ADB.  The government will finance the equivalent of $75,000 in kind through \n ", "  5 \nthe provision of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and local communication services. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The PSC will be the executing agency for the TA. All TA components will require the \ncooperation of the MFEM and OPM in particular, and other ministries, agencies, and outer \nisland administrations as relevant. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from December 2010 to November 2011. It \nwill require 6 person-months of an international consultant in the areas of public sector reform \nand organizational development, and 8 person-months of a national consultant in public sector \norganizational assessment. The consultants will carry out the activities as defined in the terms \nof reference (Appendix 3). The consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time \nto time). Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, \nas amended from time to time) and will be handed to the government on completion of the TA. \nThe government will ensure that all required counterpart staff, other human resources, and \nsupport facilities will be available to the consultants in a timely manner. The proceeds of the TA \nwill be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n23.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones and a final report summarizing the achievements, issues, lessons, and steps leading \nto the next phase. Throughout the TA, the team leader will submit (via e-mail) brief monthly \nprogress reports summarizing TA activities, progress, issues, and constraints. Team members \nwill produce reports on their respective activities for the team leader\u2019s progress and final reports. \nThe team leader\u2019s final report will be submitted in draft form at least 5 weeks prior to the end of \nthe assignment, and the final report within 2 weeks of receipt of comments by the government \nand ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government \nof the Cook Islands to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nPublic Finance Management and Public Sector Performance Review, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  and/or Indicators with  Reporting Mechanisms    \nSummary  Baselines  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nA government structure  Public sector personnel  MFEM annual budget  Actions taken result in \nthat is cost-effective  costs to reduce to 40%  papers  service standard \nand aligned to national  of total government    improvements \npriorities  revenue by 2015 (2010   \nStable fiscal environment \nbaseline: 45%)   \n     \nPublic sector    Risk \nemployees to reduce to    Change in priorities following \n15% of the total  MFEM annual budget  any change in government \nworkforce by 2015  papers \n(2006 baseline: 18%)   \n   \nService charters for   \npublic entities   \ndeveloped and  Assessment of corporate \nimplemented by  plans service delivery \nJanuary 2015 (2009  standards (citizens\u2019 report \nbaseline: None)  card) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nOptions for priority  NSDC signs off on  Minutes of NSDC meeting  Government (ministries and \npublic administration  functional analysis    agencies) demonstrates \nreforms available to the  report by October 2011    commitment to reform \ngovernment  (2010 baseline: None)    objectives \n   \nCollaboration between main \nNSDC signs off on  Minutes of NSDC meeting \ncentral agencies (PSC, \npublic administrative   \nMFEM, and OPM) \nmanual by October   \n2011 (2010 baseline:    Public support for reforms \nNone)   \n   \nPlanning, management,  Budget papers \nand monitoring \nsuccessfully pilot tested \nin PSC, OPM, and \nMFEM by October 2011 \n(2010 baseline: None) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
