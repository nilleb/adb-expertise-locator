During  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  programming  mission  to  the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) in July 2003, the Government requested advisory technical \nassistance (TA) in the area of compulsory education finance (CEF), subsequently confirmed for \ninclusion in the 2004 TA program.  Support to the Ministry of Education (MOE) on CEF reforms \nwill  be  vital  to  sustaining  and  advancing  progress  in  universalizing  compulsory  education \n(comprising 9 years of primary and lower secondary schooling), linked to the second Millennium \nDevelopment Goal,1 and to achieving broader national economic and social development goals. \nMOE views systematic CEF reform as key to improving education quality and system efficiency.   \n \n2.  Discussions with representatives from MOE, the Ministry of Finance (MOF),2 and other \nrelevant national and international organizations during the Fact-Finding Mission on 17\u221226 \nMarch 2004 confirmed the timeliness of TA to support policy and institutional reforms in CEF \nand formulation of viable mechanisms for implementation; these will be central to promoting \nimproved education quality, access, and equity.  Subsequent discussions firmed up agreement \nwith the Government on the TA\u2019s goal, objective, scope, implementation arrangements, cost \nand financing, and outline consultant terms of reference.3  The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Broad international evidence demonstrates that primary and lower secondary education \nyield  high  economic  returns,  including  higher  individual  earnings  in  the  workforce  and \nsubstantial benefits for local and national economic development. This is particularly true in less \ndeveloped countries and areas. Recent estimates for the PRC's Western Region indicate that \nthe  economic  returns  and  poverty  reduction  impact  from  public  investments  in  education \nsubstantially  exceed  those  for  other  investments  studied.4  More  broadly,  basic  education \n(defined here to include primary and lower secondary schooling, and nonformal education for \nliteracy and numeracy skills) plays a critical role by allowing citizens to respond to a changing \nsocioeconomic environment and to participate in, and contribute productively to, the PRC's \neconomic  and  social  development.  Basic  education,  particularly  for  females,  also  has  far-\nreaching  intergenerational  effects  by  influencing  sanitation,  nutrition  and  health,  fertility \ndecisions, and investment in children\u2019s human capital and well-being.     \n \n4.  The PRC has made significant progress in extending education coverage since enacting \ncomprehensive education finance reforms in 1985, which decentralized the main responsibilities \nfor rural education to townships and villages and encouraged diversified resource mobilization, \nand the 1986 Compulsory Education Law, which stated that all children should receive 9 years \nof education.  However, major challenges remain.  In particular, disadvantaged communities are \nleast able to mobilize and manage resources to provide quality education; disparities in per-\nstudent expenditure have grown fastest at the primary level.5,6 Exacerbated by weak planning \nand management and inadequate funding for teacher salaries and learning materials, cost \nburdens on poor households and low education quality in poor areas are key factors depressing \n                                                 \n1  This states that, by 2015, all boys and girls should complete a full course of primary schooling. The third goal aims \nto eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005. \n2   Within MOF, the Education Division of the Department of Education, Culture, and Science oversees CEF issues. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 28 January 2004. \n4  International Food Policy Research Institute. 2002.

In view of these challenges, the Government has renewed its commitment to providing \neducation for all, reflected in an action plan released in April 2003, and to achieving the \"two \nbasics\": universalization of literacy and of 9-year compulsory education.  Special emphasis has \nbeen given to the Western Region, where 372 counties had not yet universalized compulsory \neducation by the end of the 2002-2003 school year, with 60 counties failing to provide full \nprimary education and 260 still battling against illiteracy among the young and middle-aged.  In \nSeptember 2003, the minister of education set three goals for rural education reform, to (i) \nrealize the \"two basics\" in the Western Region; (ii) improve quality and reduce dropouts in rural \nlower  secondary  schools;  and  (iii)  cultivate  rural  schools  into  bases  for  poverty  reduction \nthrough  compulsory,  vocational,  and  adult  education.  Simultaneously,  the  State  Council \nDecision on Strengthening Rural Education underscored a commitment to ensure access to \nquality education.  It called for (i) expanding and systematizing transfer payments, particularly \nfrom province-level governments, directly to counties, which took on lead responsibility for rural \neducation management under the 2001 reforms; (ii) increasing transparency and accountability; \nand (iii) introducing exemptions from miscellaneous fees and textbook charges and dormitory \nfee subsidies, initially focusing on poor families in central and western PRC.     \n \n6.  The TA will assist the PRC to enhance and better track the allocation of CEF resources, \nto improve efficiency and equity. This is essential to meet the needs of rural communities, \nminority populations, poor urban migrants, and other disadvantaged groups. This support is \ntimely, in  view of broader shifts affecting revenue collection and budgetary responsibilities \nacross  administrative  levels,  most  notably  (i)  the  initiation  of  a  tax-for-fee  reform  in  2002, \nabolishing surtaxes for rural education, township pooling funds, and informal charges; and (ii) \nplans announced in March 2004 to eliminate most special agricultural taxes and phase out \nregular agriculture taxes by 2009. These create both opportunities and challenges for CEF. \n \n7.  The TA will build on research and programs by domestic and international agencies, \ntypically  focused  on  specific  facets  of  CEF.  Incorporating  dialogue  with  MOE  and  other \nstakeholders to identify key challenges and constraints, the TA will help develop a unified \nframework, with a concrete action plan for implementing priority reforms. Support for CEF \nreform is consistent with (i) increased emphasis given to balanced social development at the \nSecond Session of the Tenth National People's Congress in March 2004; and (ii) the first pillar \nof ADB\u2019s PRC country strategy and program (2003\u22122007) on reducing inequalities, within the \noverall aim of promoting pro-poor economic growth by enabling the poor to have greater access \nto opportunities and benefits of economic prosperity. This assistance also builds on a series of \nADB TAs supporting PRC education in the mid-1990s,8 and ongoing TA9 to explore strategies \nfor innovative use of information and communication technology to improve basic education \nquality and access in poor communities. Together, these provide a foundation for ADB's future \ninvolvement in PRC education.   \n \n                                                 \n7  World Bank.  2002.

The long-term goal of the TA is to put in place effective financing policies, strategies, and \nmechanisms to ensure universal access to quality primary and lower secondary education, \nthereby promoting equitable social and economic development. The TA's overall purpose is to \nformulate and build consensus on viable strategies to enhance the level and allocation of \nresources financing compulsory education in the PRC. A particular focus will be placed on \nequity; the timeliness and stability of resource delivery to schools; and impact on children's \nparticipation in education, teaching and learning processes, and learning outcomes.   \n \n9.  Based on thorough analysis of needs and gaps in financial resources and capacities for \nimplementing compulsory education, assessment of international models and lessons learned, \nand discussion with key stakeholders, the TA's specific objectives are to \n \n(i)  develop  specific  mechanisms  across  administrative  levels  to  increase  financial \ninputs, while alleviating burdens on poor families and addressing other resource-\nrelated obstacles to children's full participation in education; \n(ii)  formulate concrete measures to rationalize and systematize education budgeting \nand expenditure allocation across administrative levels; geographic regions; urban-\nrural areas; and primary, lower secondary, and other levels of education; and \n(iii)  identify and propose systematic interventions to address priority gaps in intra- and \ninter-agency decision-making processes and human resource capacities in CEF \nplanning and implementation at various administrative levels. \n \n10.  These will be reflected in a comprehensive framework and action plan in the final report, \nwhich will set out clear priorities and identify financial and human resources needed. \n \n11.  To achieve these objectives, TA outputs will include the following analytical reports, \nwhich are detailed in Appendix 2: \n \n(i)  a background report on the macro-level context surrounding CEF; \n(ii)  a research report documenting and identifying findings of a study on micro-level \ninvestigation on local models for funding primary and lower secondary education; \n(iii)  a major interim report on CEF funding and allocation, incorporating findings from \ntwo  policy  studies  covering  (a)  funding  responsibilities,  and  (b)  allocation  of \ngovernment and nongovernment funding; and \n(iv)  a final report on recommendations for reforming CEF in the PRC, incorporating \nfindings of a third policy study, covering CEF implementation and outcomes, and \nconsensus reached on a framework and action plan.  \n \n12.  In line with the overall action plan and reflected in an annex to the final report, the fifth \ndeliverable will be a working model\u2014demonstrated and refined through a pilot test (para. 13)\u2014\nfor monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of CEF inputs, administration, and outcomes at different \nadministrative levels.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Under the TA's research and analytical studies component, consultants will work with \nMOE and other central and local agencies in carrying out macro- and micro-level investigations \nand the three policy studies, culminating in the reports described in para. 11 and Appendix 2.  \nWorkshops integrated into the research process will support information sharing, consensus-\nbuilding, and refinement of draft research outputs; this will include major review workshops for \nthe draft interim report (timed with the midterm review mission) and draft final report, which will \n ", " 4  \ndraw representatives from MOE, MOF, the National Development and Reform Commission, and \nother relevant domestic and international agencies. Following completion of the macro-level \nstudy, a more extensive micro-level investigation will focus on (i) 1\u22122 counties in a poor Western \nRegion province or autonomous region that are nationally designated as key working counties \nfor poverty alleviation, (ii) 1\u22122 additional target counties in a moderate-income central province, \nand (iii) 1 comparator county in an eastern province. Analysis will include local CEF resources, \ndecision-making and administration down to the school level, and impacts on education quality, \naccess, and cost burdens, particularly for poor households. Findings from macro- and micro-\nlevel studies will feed into the three policy studies.      \n \n14.  Implemented  during  the  latter  half  of  the  TA,  the  second  component  consists of  a \nfocused pilot study on M&E to track CEF planning, inputs, and outcomes. The pilot study will \ndraw  on  baseline  information  collected  under  the  micro-level  study,  to  allow  tracking  of \neducation outcomes alongside planning and resource movements in target counties and at \nhigher levels. Consultants' draft design for the pilot test will be reviewed at a workshop during \nthe  midterm  review.  Subsequent,  mostly  local  seminars  will  help  to  refine  the  pilot  test's \nimplementation  strategy,  build  needed  capacities  among  participating  personnel  in  target \nlocalities, and evaluate pilot performance. Findings and capacities built will support continued \nimplementation and scale up of M&E mechanisms after TA completion.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $640,000 equivalent, of which $200,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $440,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested that ADB finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$300,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining local currency cost, \nequivalent to $140,000, through the provision of office accommodation venues for training and \nvarious meetings, counterpart staff and allowances, communication and administrative support \n(including support for workshops and seminars), support for activities under the M&E pilot, and \npost-pilot-test implementation. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented from August 2004 to July 2006. The Ministry of Education \nDepartment of Finance (MOE-DF) will be the TA Executing Agency, with the Comprehensive \nDivision overseeing day-to-day implementation, including (i) coordinating consultant selection \nprocesses and supervising consultant performance; (ii) conducting administrative tasks and \nensuring timely provision of Government inputs noted below; and (iii) acting as MOE liaison for \nthe consultants and ADB, including facilitating access to relevant education data, nonrestricted \npolicy documents, communication channels, and other information resources needed for TA \nimplementation. The Comprehensive Division will also take lead responsibility in organizing and \nimplementing a small roundtable meeting early in the TA to review the draft report covering the \nmacro-level context, a final conference at the TA\u2019s end, and other activities as agreed by ADB.10 \nTo ensure timely provision of related goods and services, an advance payment facility will be \nestablished, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance \nGrants, and subject to terms laid out in the letter establishing the facility.       \n \n17.  The Government and ADB agree to include this TA as one of the projects selected under \nthe Pilot Study for Delegation of Consultant Recruitment and Supervision under Technical \n                                                 \n10  MOE-DF proposals for workshops and other activities may identify resource persons to augment consultant inputs. ", "       5\nAssistance  to  Executing  Agencies  (Pilot  Study)11  approved  by  ADB.  In  particular,  the \nGovernment agrees to follow the implementation procedures outlined in the Pilot Study Board \npaper and such other detailed procedures and practices as ADB may require from time to time. \nThe Government acknowledges that the terms and conditions of the Technical Assistance \nFramework Agreement (TAFA) between the Government and ADB dated 23 December 1996 \napply to this TA. For the purposes of Section 3.01 of the TAFA, ADB agrees to delegate \nconsultant selection and supervision for firms or individuals under this TA to the Government. \nThe  TA  Letter  of  Agreement  to  be  issued  for  this  TA  under  the  TAFA  will  reflect  this \narrangement.  As  provided  in  the  TAFA,  consultants  engaged  and  supervised  by  the \nGovernment under this TA will, inter alia, have the status of experts performing missions for \nADB and will be entitled to the privileges and exemptions conferred upon such experts under \nthe Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. MOE-DF will seek ADB approval \nbefore any proposed material deviations from agreed consultant inputs.12 \n \n18.  MOE will select and engage (i) one individual domestic consultant13 (3 person-months) \nto  provide  early  background  research  leading  to  the  report  on  the  macro-level  context \nsurrounding CEF; and (ii) a consultant firm or agency, which will mobilize and coordinate a team \nof consultants totaling 7.5 person-months of international and 34 person-months of domestic \nconsultant services. The selection and engagement of the latter will use the simplified technical \nproposal format under the quality and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers; proposals \nmay indicate either the international or domestic policy adviser as overall team leader. As set \nout  in  the  Pilot  Study  Board  paper,  ADB's  review  of  firm-based  consultant  selection  will \ngenerally follow procedures used in ADB loans. The outline terms of reference for consultant \ninputs are in Appendix 4.        \n \n19.  In addition to stakeholder participation in formal workshops, the consultants will conduct \nregular dialogue and information sharing with domestic and international agencies throughout \nTA implementation, to ensure (i) the accuracy and relevance of TA findings and strategic and \ntechnical recommendations, (ii) complementarity of efforts with other initiatives, (iii) ability to \nrespond  to  an  evolving  context  surrounding  CEF,  and  (iv)  consensus  behind  final \nrecommendations to ensure their actualization.  MOE-DF and ADB will jointly review major \ndrafts of reports (prepared in English and Chinese), and finalized reports will be disseminated to \ndecision-makers and other key stakeholders to maximize their impact.    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China for Support for Reforms In Compulsory \nEducation Financing, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003.

TA deliverables will include four analytical reports.   \n \n(i)  As an early input to subsequent work, a report will be presented on the macro-\nlevel  context  surrounding  compulsory  education  finance  (CEF),  which  will  (a) \noutline  key  relevant  reforms,  policies  and  programs,  and  other  macro-level \ninitiatives inside and outside the education sector (e.g., reforms of rural taxation \nand education management, the national compulsory education program, etc.); \nand (b) assess their implications for CEF and management. \n(ii)  Guided by findings of this macro-level analysis and outside research, a research \nreport will document and identify findings of a study on micro-level investigation on \nlocal  models  for  funding  primary  and  lower  secondary  education,  including \nanalysis of at least three facets: (a) sources and levels of funding; (b) decision-\nmaking, planning, and administration related to allocation of expenditures for local \neducation;  and  (c)  impact  on  education  quality  (see  para.  3[vi]),  access,  and \nhousehold burdens,  with  a  particular  focus  on  poor  areas  and  disadvantaged \nmembers within communities.1 The study design will allow the impact of CEF-\nrelated variables to be differentiated from other factors. \n(iii)  An  interim  report  on  CEF  funding  and  allocation  will  include  domestic  and \ninternational  case  studies,  other  analysis,  and  tentative  recommendations  (for \nrefinement in the final report) covering policy and legislative aspects, as well as \ninstitutional  change  and  capacity  building  needed  to  ensure  effective  CEF \ndecision-making and implementation. This will be based on two policy studies on \n(a) funding responsibilities\u2014based on the current division of compulsory education \nfunding  burdens,  assessment  of  capacities  for  sustainable  financing  by \ngovernments at various levels, and analysis of the role of household and other \nnongovernment sources; and (b) allocation of government and nongovernment \nfunding to meet needs across schools in different geographic regions, urban-rural \nareas, and primary, lower secondary and other sub-sectors of education; and \n(iv)  The  main  output  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  a  final  report  on \nrecommendations for reforming CEF in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nincorporating  findings  of  a  third  policy  study  (on  CEF  implementation  and \noutcomes) and consensus reached on a framework and action plan.  \n \n2.  The  final  report  will  be  the  TA's  paramount  output,  providing  a  comprehensive \nassessment of CEF in the PRC and identifying key gaps and inefficiencies. Analysis will feed \ninto (and provide a strong justification for) proposed reforms, and the report will set down a \nreform  framework  outlining  clear  priorities,  with  an  action  plan  giving  concrete \nrecommendations, including specific implementation mechanisms. In addition to synthesizing \nfindings of macro- and micro-level research under the TA and from other sources, the final \nreport will integrate findings of a third policy study on CEF implementation and outcomes. This \nstudy will investigate the relationship between funding (including distributional and management \naspects), education access and quality, and students' educational outcomes. Research and \nrecommendations will focus on (i) efficiency and equity in the use of public resources to achieve \ncompulsory  education  targets;  and  (ii)  institutions,  decision-making  processes,  and  human \ncapacities2 in implementing CEF, as determinants of efficiency and equity.
