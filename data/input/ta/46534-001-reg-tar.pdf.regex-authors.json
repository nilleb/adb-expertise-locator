INTRODUCTION \n1.  Disbursement is a vital part of the project cycle and a critical factor in successful project \nimplementation. Consequently, the Controller's Department (CTL) has been providing capacity \ndevelopment seminars on disbursement for developing member countries (DMCs) since 1990. \nThe  investment  loan  disbursement  seminars  have  been  conducted  for  staff  of  executing \nagencies,  implementing  agencies, ministries  of finance,  and government  audit  offices. The \nseminars  have  focused  on  enhancing  the  understanding  of  executing  and  implementing \nagencies, and application of disbursement procedures of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe seminars have also aimed to resolve disbursement-related issues faced by executing and \nimplementing agencies in their respective projects.  \n \n2.  So far, DMCs have provided positive feedback on previous seminars and, at the same \ntime,  CTL  disbursement  operations  have  also  benefited.  Staff  members  of  executing  and \nimplementing agencies who attended the seminars were able to submit improved withdrawal \napplications by applying knowledge gained from the seminars. It is worth noting that quality \nwithdrawal  applications  contribute  to  timely  transfer  of  resources  to  DMCs  and  to  project \nimplementation.  \n \n3.  The demand for training seminars on investment loan and grant disbursement from \nDMCs such as Central Asia, the Greater Mekong Subregion, and the Pacific, People\u2019s Republic \nof China, India, Myanmar continues to increase. Based on CTL\u2019s past experience and on \nincreasing ADB operations, it is expected that further demands from other DMCs may arise \nduring implementation of the capacity development technical assistance (TA). The demands \nfrom  the  DMCs  noted  above  are  attributed  to  issues  such  as  recent  resumption  of  ADB \noperations  in  Myanmar,  revision  of  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  in  2012,  high \nturnover of project disbursement staff, and lack of institutional capacity. \n \n4.  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  response  to  the  DMCs\u2019  demands,  concurrence  of  respective \ngovernments  is  secured  in  the  early  stages  of  seminar  preparation.  The  government  is \nconsulted on and informed of the objectives of the seminar, logistical arrangements, financial \nresources available from ADB, and other assistance needed. Seminar participants are invited by \nthe government, in consultation with CTL.  \n \n5.  In the past, seminars were funded from small-scale regional TA projects.1 Capacity \ndevelopment  TA  of  $225,000  has  been  financing  the  seminars  since  late  2011,  with  an \nexpected completion date of 30 September 2013.2 As of 21 January 2013, the TA had an \nuncommitted balance of $2,506. This amount is not enough to meet the current demands from \nthe DMCs; these will be provided for under the proposed capacity development TA. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 3  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance for Loan Disbursement Seminars.

Manila (TA 7897-REG).  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 February 2013.  \n ", "2 \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  Lack  of  institutional  capacity  is  the  main  issue  encountered  by  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  of  various  DMCs.  This  involves  lack  of  understanding  or  previous \nexperience of the ADB investment loan and grant disbursement procedures. The capacity issue \ncauses submission of substandard withdrawal applications to ADB. Such application quality \nhinders the timely transfer of loan or grant funds to the DMCs and successful implementation of \nthe project.  \n \n7.  Based on CTL\u2019s interactions with governments in past seminars, institutional capacity \nissues can be attributed to various causes. One of the common ones is high turnover of \nexperienced project staff handling disbursement, e.g., in Mongolia and other DMCs in Central \nAsia and the Greater Mekong Subregion. The staff concerned move to the private sector for \nopportunities  which  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  cannot  match.  As  long  as \nturnover is an ongoing issue, the gap in institutional capacity continues. This gap is filled by new \nstaff who have limited or no experience with ADB disbursement procedures. Such skills and \nknowledge gaps often contribute to the problems encountered by CTL during implementation of \nprojects. Without  provision  of  timely  intervention  measures,  such  as  regular  and  proactive \ncapacity development on investment loan and grant disbursements, lack of institutional capacity \nis expected to have a negative impact on project implementation.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  will  be  improved  mobilization  of  loan  and grant fund  transfers to  DMC \ngovernments.  \n \n9.  The outcome will be enhanced knowledge of executing agency staff on ADB policies and \nprocedures related to financial administration of projects. Achievement of the outcome derives \nfrom (i) conducting trainings on ADB investment loan disbursement procedures and practices, \nupdating the knowledge of participants; (ii) conducting knowledge-sharing forums on country- \nand project-specific disbursement issues, in conjunction with issues resolution; (iii) sharing ADB \nbest practices on loan disbursements; and (iv) supporting and sharing the seminar resources \nwith the executing and implementing agencies for further training of project disbursement staff, \nincluding those at the lower levels of the fund flow chain such as counties and provinces.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  It is estimated that 25 seminars and workshops will be carried out with an estimated 750 \nparticipants.  The  targeted  DMCs  are  Group  A  DMCs  (those  with  access  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund only), and Group B and C DMCs that have requested or are likely to request \na  seminar  based  on  CTL\u2019s  experience.4 The  expected  participants  are  (i)  finance  and \naccounting  staff  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  who  are  directly  involved  in \ndisbursement, and (ii) representatives from ministries of finance and government audit offices. \nResource speakers will be drawn mainly from Controller Department\u2019s Loan and Administration \nDivision and disbursement unit staff (for resident missions with a delegated disbursement unit). \nAdditional resource speakers will be invited from ministries of finance to speak on counterpart \n                                                \n4  For a full listing of countries, see ADB. 2011.

Manila (section E). \n ", "3 \n \nfund contributions and from government audit offices to speak on general audit issues from the \naudit of ADB project financial statements.  \n \n11.  The seminar will cover topics such as  \n(i)  loan and grant products and features;  \n(ii)  disbursement policies and procedures;  \n(iii)  country- and project-specific case studies and group discussion;  \n(iv)  preparation, submission, and monitoring of loan withdrawal applications;  \n(v)  project accounting and monitoring compliance;  \n(vi)  government counterpart fund contributions and accounting systems; and  \n(vii)  general audit issues for the ADB projects in the DMC concerned. \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $300,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency;  CTL  will  implement  the  TA.  The  expected \ncommencement date is February 2013 and expected completion date is December 2014. The \nTA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the  Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n14.  The resource speakers and targeted participants are mentioned in para. 10. \n \n15.  The  average  duration  of each  seminar  is  expected  to  be 2 days. However, longer \nduration can be coordinated by CTL and the government concerned. There will be an average \nof around 30 participants for each seminar to allow effective participation and discussion. More \nparticipants may be requested by the government in coordination with CTL. Seminars may be \ncarried out more than once a year in the DMC based on geographical location and spread. \nSmaller workshops may be carried out based on the request of the DMC and in coordination \nwith CTL.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Investment Loan and Grant Disbursement Seminars for Developing Member Countries, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "4  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n     \nSeminars are customized to \nImproved  % of rejected  LFIS and GFIS \ncountry-specific issues \nmobilization  withdrawal  reports  \n \nof loan and  applications   \nRisks \ngrant fund  attributable to the   \nHigh turnover of trained staff \ntransfer to  executing agency \n \ngovernments   improves  \n    Political instability in certain \n  countries \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced  % of the participants  Seminar evaluation  Participants will apply the \nknowledge of  satisfied with the  forms from  concepts, policies, and \nexecuting agency  relevance and  participants \nprocedures shared and learned \nstaff on ADB  usefulness of the   \n \npolicies and  seminar \nRisks \nprocedures   \nRelevant participants are not \nrelated to financial \ninvited  \nadministration of \n \nprojects   \nLack of commitment from the \nparticipants \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \nInvestment loan and  25 seminars to be  Back-to-office  All executing and implementing \ngrant disbursement  conducted  reports  agencies are invited and attend \nseminars to support    the seminar \nthe DMCs \n \n \nResource persons are available \n Activities with Milestones   Inputs \n1.
