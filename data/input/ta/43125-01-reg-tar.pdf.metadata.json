INTRODUCTION \n1.  The global financial crisis revealed the fiscal vulnerability of the Central and West Asian \ncountries1 to external shocks. Some countries requested crisis recovery and countercyclical \nsupport programs to tide them over during the tight fiscal situation in 2009 and to cover critical \nexpenditures, particularly in the social sectors and safety nets. Fiscal resources are still limited, \nyet  essential  public  goods  and  services  must  be  delivered.  Included  here  are  goods  and \nservices in core sectors under the long-term strategy framework of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for 2009\u20132020 (Strategy 2020), such as education, energy, transport, and water supply \nand sanitation.2 The governments must see to it that service delivery improves and public \ninvestments  become  more  efficient  because  of  governance,  public  financial  management \n(PFM), and related interventions. Moreover, policy lending should not only help create enabling \nenvironments for sector investments but also leverage reforms to promote investments. \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) aims to help the institutions in Central and West Asia \nmanage (i.e., plan, allocate, monitor, and account for) public resources in an optimal manner to \nachieve  more  targeted  and  effective  results  in  education  and  water  supply  and  sanitation \nsectors. It will also amplify the impact and outcome of ADB\u2019s public management operations in \nCentral  and  West  Asia.  Rapid  gap  assessments  in  core  sectors  will  first  identify  public \nmanagement  interventions  that  can  improve  the  results  of  investment  projects.  Results \nmanagement  and  governance  tool  kits  customized  to  suit  each  country\u2019s  needs  will  be \ndeveloped  for  each  sector.  Pilots  will  then  be  designed  for  programmatic  lending  to  help \nparticipating countries achieve more targeted policy reform as well as effective and tangible \nresults in core sectors in line  with ADB\u2019s results framework.  It will likewise benefit ADB\u2019s \nengagement with participating countries. The TA will also provide advisory support and training, \nat  the  sector  level,  in  budget  planning  and  execution,  procurement,  fiduciary  control,  and \nfinancing options. The Central and West Asian countries have been made aware by the global \nfinancial crisis of the risks of inertia in critical governance and public management reforms, and \nshould  mostly  own  and  support  the  reforms  under  the  TA.3  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Weak links between public management operations and sector activities. Through \npolicy-based lending, ADB has been engaged in improving public resource management in the \nCentral and West Asian countries, specifically Afghanistan and Pakistan (mainly Balochistan, \nPunjab, and Sindh provinces). Since 2003, more than $1 billion has been provided to leverage \npublic management reforms. Most of the reforms involved revenue generation, budgeting, the \nprivate provision of public goods, and the strengthening of the civil service. While most of the \nreforms had some positive impact on country systems, a more tangible and clearer link to \nimprovements in policy and results management areas has been hard to establish. A major \nfactor is the absence of more in-depth sector-specific interventions in favor of general process \npolicy reforms that will have cross cutting impact. Central and West Asian countries continue to \nface capacity constraints that prevent maximizing synergies between policy-based operations \n                                                \n1  These are countries covered by the Central and West Asia Department such as Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 November 2010. \n ", "2   \nand investment projects in core sectors, which could translate to more tangible results.4 ADB\u2019s \npublic management operations should have greater sector impact and reforms should improve \noperating environments in the core sectors supported under Strategy 2020. \n \n4.  Unquantifiable results of policy lending. The results of public resource management \nreform programs have been difficult to quantify. Support has generally been provided through \nprogram lending: fund disbursements are quick and transaction costs low. However, the links \nbetween policy alternatives and outcomes are often unclear. Many programs are too ambitious \nand complex, and well beyond the capacity of government to implement them. Multitranche \nprograms lock the parties into anticipated future states, then shifts in policy priorities undo their \nassumptions. Cluster programs are more flexible, but they require a clear medium-term reform \nagenda,  which  is  often  based  on  input.  If  this  reform  agenda  is  not  realized,  program \ndisbursement\u2013\u2013if it occurs at all\u2013\u2013becomes complicated and is delayed. In contrast, project \nlending, while providing a clear link between financing and outcomes, is frequently rigid in \npreparation, and the conservative project designs that result often limit the space for midcourse \ncorrections.  Project  financing  frequently  involves  high  transaction  costs  linked  to \nimplementation, delays due to capacity constraints in the borrowing country, and donor process \nrequirements\u2014all of which often stand in the way of results. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The  expected  impact  of the TA  is  more  efficient  and  effective  public  services  and \ninfrastructure in education and water supply and sanitation, as measured by improvements in \nthe level 2 indicators in the ADB results framework for the Central and West Asian countries. \nAmong these indicators are classrooms built and upgraded, teachers trained, water supply \npipes installed or upgraded, new households connected to water supply, wastewater treated, \nand households served with new sanitation connections. \n \n6.  The expected outcome is improved results orientation in participating Central and West \nAsian countries in the core sectors under Strategy 2020, particularly in education and in water \nsupply and sanitation. During TA implementation, results-based public management operations \nwill be prepared in the participating Central and West Asian countries.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will have four outputs: (i) rapid assessment of country sectoral governance and \nPFM, and the related capacity-building needs; (ii) sector results management and governance \ntool  kits;  (iii) the  design  of  pilots  for  results-  and  risk-based  programmatic  lending;  and \n(iv) training, workshops, and conference. \n1.  Rapid Assessment of Country Sectoral Governance and Public Financial \nManagement, and the Related Capacity-Building Needs  \n8.  The TA will support rapid assessments of governance and PFM needs, and the related \ngaps, in education, energy, transport, and water supply and sanitation. The work will build on \nthe country and sector risk assessments under the Second Governance and Anticorruption \n                                                \n4  E.g., policy reforms to increase transparency and accountability, provide financing options, overcome obstacles \nincluding procurement problems, make government fund flows more efficient, improve sector governance, and \ndevelop an environment conducive to more effective and efficient investment projects. \n ", "  3 \nAction Plan (GACAP II).5 A desk review will be made, followed by fieldwork in selected Central \nand West Asian countries. The stocktaking exercise will  examine sector needs relating to \nbudget  execution,  procurement,  fiduciary  control,  the  impact  of  regulations  on  investment \nprojects, and institutional arrangements. It will also look into the need in specific countries for \nefficiency-improving innovations (such as e-governance), alternative methods of financing (such \nas public\u2013private partnership [PPP]), intergovernmental fiscal transfers, and complaint redress \nmechanisms. How sector performance objectives and indicators align with country goals and \ntargets  will  be  analyzed.  The  assessment  will  cover  as  well  the  adequacy  of  country \nmanagement information systems to provide timely and accurate data for measuring results. \nAssessments already made under the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) \nProgram6 will be considered, and PEFA indicators included and updated, where applicable. The \ngovernment and other stakeholders will be consulted, as will ADB, to maximize synergies \nbetween governance and sector specialists. (See the supplementary appendix for a discussion \nof governance and PFM risks.) \n2.  Sector Results Management and Governance Tool Kits \n9.  In parallel with the rapid gap assessments, sector results management and governance \ntool kits will be prepared for the use by (i) government staff in participating countries (mainly \nfinance, planning, and line [sector] ministries); (ii) project implementation units; and (iii) ADB \nstaff.  The  tool  kits  will  help  to  create  governance  environments  that  can  yield  timely, \ncost-effective, and tangible results. They will also assist participating countries in policy dialogue \nto  facilitate  the  design  and  implementation  of  improved  policy  lending  and  investment \noperations. The tool kits will be developed by experts in managing for development results \n(MfDR) and in governance, pilot-tested in education and water supply and sanitation, and \ncustomized to fit the countries\u2019 needs. Ongoing and previous work in MfDR will be considered in \nthe design of the tool kits. The tool kits are envisaged to provide guidance in the following areas, \namong others: \n(i)  the operating environment in  each sector, including the legal and regulatory \nframework,7  the  procurement  framework,  institutional  and  oversight \narrangements, and state subsidies and transfers; \n(ii)  best practice financial and funds flow arrangements for sector investments; \n(iii)  best practice procurement systems; \n(iv)  monitoring and reporting options; \n(v)  method of assessing the impact of regulations on investment projects; \n(vi)  best practice corporate governance structures;  \n(vii)  sectoral performance indicators including (a) a suggested list of sector indicators \nconsistent  with  country  goals  and  targets,  and  (b)  available  international \nbenchmarks and indicators from comparator countries; \n(viii)  best practices in management information systems for measuring results;  \n(ix)  best practices in tariff pricing, where applicable; and \n(x)  best practices in public accountability mechanisms. \n3.  Proposals  to  Pilot  Results-  and  Risk-Based  Programmatic  Lending \nDesigned \n10.  Building on output (i) and (ii) (para. 7), the TA consultants will design proposals to pilot \nresults- and risk-based programmatic (policy) lending that strengthens the link between policy \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2006. Final Report: Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II). Manila. \n6  Financed jointly by the World Bank, the European Commission, and the Department for International Development \nof the United Kingdom. \n7 A compendium of laws and regulations affecting the sector will also be developed. \n ", "4   \nreforms and sector investments. The proposals to pilot results- and risk-based lending will assist \nthe  participating  countries  to  better  support  a  results  management  culture  generally  and \nprogrammatic engagements with development partners in particular. This will be framed within \nexisting policies of ADB and will allow the participating countries and ADB to focus on the \nsoundness and technical quality of the program, the pattern of expenditures and the quality of \nthe system within which the expenditure takes place, and the monitoring and verification of \nresults. \n \n11.   The TA will also design  proposals for developing  model structures of results- and \nrisk-based programmatic lending for ADB interventions in education and water supply and \nsanitation.  A  results-oriented  lending  pipeline  linked  to  country  development  and  key \nperformance  indicators for  participating  countries  can  thus  be  developed.  If resources  are \navailable, similar modes of lending may also be designed for transport and energy. The Central \nand West Asian countries will be consulted on the possible pilot-testing of this lending mode. \nFor countries that request ADB programmatic support in implementing reforms, ADB will work \nwith policy makers, development partners, and other stakeholders to help identify and develop a \npipeline of future results-oriented lending programs. This new approach will better integrate \nreforms in public resource management components of sector reforms with investments in the \nsector.  The  Strategy  and  Policy  Department  (SPD)  of  ADB  will  be  closely  consulted  in \ndeveloping this component. \n \n12.  Consultants will be mobilized to provide advisory and technical support to policy makers \nand  stakeholders  in  specific  reform  areas  and  innovative  approaches  to  (i) ensure  proper \ninternal  controls;  (ii) reduce  the  regulatory  burden;  (iii) improve  procurement  efficiency; \n(iv) increase the efficiency of intergovernmental fiscal transfers to support local government \ndelivery of social services like education; (v) identify financing options for public services and \ninvestments,  e.g.,  through  PPP;  (vi) identify  opportunities  for  e-governance  activities;  and \n(vii) develop more effective and responsive mechanisms for handling complaints. Case studies \non results- and risk-based policy lending products will also be prepared. \n \n13.   As  part  of  the  design  of  results-  and  risk-based  lending,  a  list  of  disaggregated \nindicators  will  be  developed  for  various  sectors,  to  be  used  in  tracking  and  reporting  the \ncontribution of ADB financing and its value addition. The indicators will be in addition to the \npolicy conditions and will serve as interim signposts for tracking progress in service delivery and \nother  areas. (See  Appendix  2  for  a  more  detailed  presentation  of  results-  and  risk-based \nprogrammatic lending) \n4.  Training, Workshops, and Conference  \n14.  Training needs in governance, PFM, and MfDR will be identified and a training program \ndeveloped  for  financing  under  the  TA.  Peer-to-peer  learning,  as  well  as  capacity-building \napproaches that promote links with other governments implementing related reforms in the \nregion, will be supported. The training programs will be aimed at improving public service \ndelivery. They will also broaden stakeholder awareness of results management, and the design \nand implementation of the pilot results- and risk-based programmatic lending. Staff of relevant \npartner  agencies  will  be  trained.  Knowledge  sharing  will  take  place  through  a  regional \nconference organized to improve the impact of public management operations on education and \nrelated knowledge products. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed \nwith  a  grant  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013other  sources).  The \n ", "  5 \nfinancing  will  cover  the  remuneration  and  travel  expenses  of  international  and  national \nconsultants; workshop, training, and conference expenses; the cost of the rapid assessments \nand  tool  kits;  reports  and  communications;  and  other  miscellaneous  expenses.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. During TA implementation, ADB will explore \npossible cofinancing from other development partners to augment funding for TA activities. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency, and the Financial Sector, Public Management and \nTrade Division, Central and West Asia Department (CWFM), the implementing agency.8 CWFM \nwill closely monitor the implementation and evaluate the achievements of the TA through the \ndesign and monitoring framework. CWFM will also work closely with other sector divisions, and \nADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel (OGC), Private Sector Operations Department, and SPD \nto ensure complementarity in projects. The TA is expected to begin in January 2011, and be \ncompleted by June 2013. Financial closing of the TA is expected by December 2013.  \n \n17.  ADB input will total 29 person-months of international and 18 person-months of national \nconsulting services. To help implement output (i)\u2013(iii) (para. 7), a firm will be hired through \nquality- and cost-based selection using a simplified technical proposal and 80:20 weighting to \nprovide  25 person-months  of  international  and  14  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices. The consultants will (i) undertake the rapid gap assessments of governance and PFM, \n(ii) prepare the results management and governance tool kit, and (iii) provide advisory and \ntechnical support in the design the pilots for results- and risk-based programmatic lending. The \nconsultants hired for output (i)\u2013(iii) will also provide input as experts for the training program and \nworkshops. \n \n18.  Individual  consultants  will  be  hired  for  output (iv)  (para. 7)  to  (i) prepare  training, \nworkshop, and regional conference materials; and (ii) organize, coordinate, and conduct the \ntraining  program,  workshops,  and  conference.  Up  to  four  experts  will  be  hired  for \n4 person-months each of international and national consulting services. National consulting \nservices  will  include  administrative  support  for  the  training  program,  workshops,  and \nconference. Resource persons for the regional conference will also be hired for output (iv).  \n \n19.  Appendix 4 discusses the outline terms of references for the consultants. ADB will hire \nthe consultants according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  To  avoid  delay,  the  hiring  will  be  done  through  advance  contracting,  in \nconsultation with ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office. The TA disbursement will conform \nto ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  Good practices and lessons will be  spread through policy dialogue and knowledge \nsharing, including the publication of knowledge products. Performance and outcomes will be \nevaluated at the end of the TA and published in a TA completion report.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Improving Public Management to Achieve Better Development Results in Central and West \nAsia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n8 Initial contact was earlier made with all Central and West Asian countries.

Proposals to pilot results- and risk-based programmatic lending can potentially improve \non  some  of  the  problems  of  project  and  program  lending  by  assessing  and  designing \ndevelopment interventions on the basis of the risks posed to aid effectiveness as reflected in the \nintended  results. The  proposals for  a  results-  and  risk-based  lending  design  factor  in  the \nquantum  of  risk  posed  by  a  particular  programmatic  intervention  and  the  implementation \nenvironment and can assist to enhance the intensity and quality of dialogue between the \ndevelopment partner and the recipient country, leading to a consensual approach to reforms. \nThe proposals can cover support for a medium-term \u2015government-owned\u2016 sector or subsector \nreform program with sector or subsector results which can extend to  areas of policy and \ninstitutional reforms as well as service delivery outcomes. The proposals for this new design will \nseek to link measurable expenditure benchmarks, outcome, and outputs. These indicators can \nbe separate and distinct from the sector results usually contained in a policy matrix. \n \n2.  One potential model of the pilot results- and risk-based programmatic lending can have \na development partner finance all or part of the financing gap in the implementation plan.  \nAssistance can be released in tranches linked to performance targets in an agreed results \nmatrix with possible additional linkages to supplementary targets such as attainment of the \nexpenditure  targets  in  identified  eligible  expenditure  areas.  Another  variation  can  seek  to \nstrengthen results  linkages further  by  equally  apportioning  the  tranche  amount  among the \nagreed results areas, and making the release contingent on meeting targets in a specified \nminimum percentage of results areas. A more sophisticated version of the pilot can create \nseparability of intra-tranche funding lines and allow the withholding of a portion of the tranche for \nthe unmet results, and its rollover to the next tranche cycle. While affording a closer link to the \nresults, these options for a piloting of results- and risk-based programmatic lending can act as a \npowerful horizontal balancer, ensuring equal attention to each of the agreed reform areas.1  \n \n3.  The proposals to pilot results- and risk-based program lending will also comment on the \nissues  linked  to  the  use  of  the  recipient  government\u2019s  systems  rather  than  the  donor\u2019s \nguidelines in dispensing aid funds. Other areas that would be covered include greater reliance \non country systems that may not be fully mature in terms of public financial management (PFM), \nprocurement, anticorruption systems, and other issues such as ability to track expenditure. The \nproposals  will  also  look  at  the  need  to  analyze  the  risks  in  sector  systems  as  well  as \ngovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms.  The  wider  policy  and  governance  environment  also \nneeds to be studied and a risk management plan commensurate with the extent and quantum of \nrisks faced in each of the above areas put in place. Where it may not be possible to reasonably \nmitigate  all  risks,  one  option  is  to  develop  special  fiduciary  arrangements  (e.g.,  special \naccounts, expenditure tracking, regular audits) and very clear links to indicators (to ensure that \nthe programmatic part remains on track). The other option may be to continue ring-fencing \ndevelopment assistance through the project mode of finance. A low-risk environment would be \nmore suitable to the pilot results- and risk-based programmatic lending.

Thus, typically the program \nimplementation unit is assisted through resident experts and specialists, who help to develop \ncapacity within the government ministries to deal with the procurement, expenditure tracking, \nand results monitoring functions.  \n \n5.

The reliance on \nthe  recipient  country\u2019s  accounting  and  reporting  system,  supported  by  performance  and \nfinancial audit, allows the development partner to concentrate on the soundness and technical \nquality of the program, the pattern of expenditures and the quality of the system within which the \nexpenditures takes place, and the monitoring and verification of results achieved.2  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n2  World  Bank.  2009.
