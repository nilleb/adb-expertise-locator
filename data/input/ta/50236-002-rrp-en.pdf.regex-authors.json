THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand  a  proposed  grant,  both  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the \nSustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project. The report also \ndescribes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the European Union (EU) for \nthe Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the EU grant.  \n \n2.  The  project  will  improve  rural  incomes  from  market-driven  diversified  farm  output, \nwatershed health, and community nutrition in the four northern provinces (FNP) of Houaphan, \nLouangphabang, Xaignabouli, and Xiangkhouang. It will (i) promote diversification into dry season \nhigh-value crops (HVCs), improve the yields of wet season rice by providing irrigation and access; \n(ii) protect watershed ecological services; and (iii) improve nutrition. The project contributes to \ngovernment policy goals for food security, economic growth, and natural resource conservation.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Lao PDR\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 7.7% during 2010\u20132017, \nbut its Human Development Index ranking (139th out of 189 countries) remains low.2 The benefits \nof growth are distributed unevenly, with the poorest quintile sharing only 7.6% of the gross national \nincome. Rapid urbanization, with 40% of the population living in urban areas, is leading to a \n\u201cfeminization\u201d  of  rural  areas  as  males  seek  work  in  urban  areas.  During  2005\u22122015,  the \npopulations of Houaphan and Xiangkhouang fell by 10%, the highest decline in the Lao PDR. The \npoverty incidence was 23% nationwide in 2012, but 29% for rural areas.3 Headcount poverty in \nthe northern region is three times higher in rural areas than urban areas. Poverty in the FNP \nranges from 20% in Xiangkhouang to 37% in Houaphan, and is due to low returns from rice \nfarming, limited skills, and lack of investment resources. It creates vulnerability to commodity price \nvolatility, loss of land through concessions, and ill health from poor diets and sanitation. Lao PDR \nremains an agrarian economy. Agriculture contributes 16% of GDP and engages more than 65% \nof the population, more than half of whom are women.4 Rice accounts for 70% of agricultural \noutput, reaching 4 million tons in 2014.5 Only 10% of the land is arable because the terrain is \nmountainous. Agriculture in the FNP is typified by fragmented production systems, high input \ncosts, and weak aggregate surplus production.  \n \n4.  Rural development is a government priority. The Five-Year National Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Plan VIII, 2016\u20132020; the Agriculture Development Strategy to 2025 and Vision to \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance.

Irrigation has increased rice output. From 1994 to 2014, the area cultivated by wet season \nirrigated  agriculture  (WSIA)  doubled  from  136,000  hectares  (ha)  to  274,000  ha,  providing \nsupplementary water during periods of low rainfall and improving household food security, but \nproviding low returns. Dry season irrigated agriculture (DSIA) increased from 16,000 ha to \n182,000 ha, with more than 18,000 irrigation schemes, of which (i) 20% involved dams or \nreservoirs; (ii) 10% used pump lift systems; and (iii) 70% used diversion weirs, 80% with small \ncommand areas of less than 100 ha. The FNP have 37,600 ha of WSIA and 13,438 ha of DSIA \nregistered. Dry season HVCs offer high returns. HVCs can increase farm incomes by (i) 180% if \na farmer changes from growing rice during both the wet and dry seasons to a wet season rice \ncrop and a dry season HVC; and (ii) 500% if a farmer grows a wet season rice crop and an \nirrigated dry season HVC. However, most farmers are unable to diversify into DSIA HVC because \nof the lack of water control systems (WCSs). Improving the capacities of water users groups \n(WUGs) and water users associations (WUAs) is crucial for managing WCSs. The increasing \nfeminization of agriculture demands women\u2019s full involvement in the decision making of WUGs \nand WUAs.  \n \n6.  Upland forest cover has declined from 70% in the 1960s to 58% in 2015, and agriculture \naccounts for nearly 50% of upland conversion in the FNP. With climate change impacts, the FNP \nare vulnerable to a range of natural disasters, including wet season high-intensity storms causing \nflooding from monsoonal rainfall, and drought related upper catchment loss of vegetative cover \nand fires. Intensified cropping on fragile and steep uplands further aggravates flash flooding, loss \nof biodiversity, soil instability, causing degraded watersheds. These events are high risks for \nhuman life and property, agricultural production, and the destruction of PRI.  \n \n7.  The annual economic cost of malnutrition is estimated to be 2.4% of GDP (2013). The \nNNSPA prioritizes nutrition-sensitive agriculture, which requires irrigation, and recognizes that \nhigher incomes lead to improved diets. In 2017, stunting was present in 33% of all children under \n5 years of age in the country and more than 40% of those in Houaphan and Xiangkhouang.9 \n \n8.  ADB value addition. Most of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment in the \nLao PDR\u2019s rural development targets PRI, where ADB\u2019s scale of investment exceeds the capacity \nof most development partners. Lessons from ADB\u2019s experience include the following:  \n \n                                                \n6  In this context, PRI comprises irrigation and rural access infrastructure. \n7  World Bank. 2018.

The government will \nfinance the equivalent of $2 million for staff costs and unexploded ordinance certification prior to \nsubproject approval. The summary financing plan is in Table 3. Sector lending is proposed to \nprovide flexibility and adequate subproject preparation; and the project meets the sector lending \ncriteria. The FNP proposed subprojects, from their agriculture development plans, which were \nscreened against agreed criteria, leading to a list of subprojects eligible for ADB financing and are \npresented in the PAM (footnote 16). The FNP, with the support of the Department of Irrigation \n(DOI) and consultants, are assessed to have the capacity to implement the project. \n \nTable 3: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loan)  40.00  77.7 \nSpecial Funds resources (grant)  5.00  9.7 \nEuropean Union (grant)a  4.46  8.7 \nGovernment (in kind)  2.00  3.9 \nTotal  51.46  100.0 \na  Administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) will be the executing agency, with MAF\u2019s \nDOI as the central implementing agency. To support the devolution of project implementation \nresponsibility, a program governance team of government staff will be established within DOI and \nwill  be  responsible  for  project  supervision  and  mentoring  of  provincial  staff.  Cloud-based \ninformation systems for project performance, procurement, and financial management will provide \ntransparency to ensure the integrity of systems and procedures. The governor\u2019s offices of the \nFNP will be the implementing agencies and will assign their provincial agricultural and forestry \noffices  (PAFOs)  for  implementation  responsibilities  using  staff  resources  for  procurement, \nfinances, and subproject design and approvals. The subprojects will be implemented in three \nbatches  (footnote 13).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  Feasibility studies and engineering designs have been prepared for the four representative \nsubprojects (RSPs) (footnote 13). The project will prepare market plans for each subproject to \nlink  production  to  markets.  Based  on  these  plans,  matching  grants  for  producers  and \nentrepreneurs will be competitively awarded to provide resources for productive assets as \ndescribed in the PAM. The disaster risk profiles indicate the need for stream flow measurements \nand assessments of historical weather events that caused damage to PRI and inadequate dry \nseason stream flows. Engineering designs have been adjusted to ensure that (i) the PRI can \nwithstand flood events, (ii) WCSs enable efficient water scheduling within the command area, and \n(iii) road designs are able to withstand high-intensity and lengthy rain events. Key features are:  \n \n(i)  Houaphan\u2019s  Nam Pua  RSP  will  upgrade  a  main  canal  and  introduce  piped \ndistribution systems for the 70 ha command area to enable DSIA HVCs. WCSs, \nsuch as gravity-pressured sprinkler systems, will enable intensified production and \nreduce women\u2019s workload.  \n(ii)  Xiangkhouang\u2019s Nam Tong RSP will (a) improve two headworks with supporting \nfish passages, (b) improve distribution canals for producing HVC vegetables, \n(c) put in place community agreements to shift upland cultivation to irrigated areas \nand fodder production, (d) cultivate forest tea to increase economic opportunities \nwith the objective of lowering destructive forest cultivation and grazing practices, \nand  (e)  connect  upland  communities  to  the  RSP  command  area  for  job \nopportunities.  \n(iii)  Louangphabang\u2019s Nam Seng RSP will extend the scheme to an additional 265 ha \nfor DSIA green soya and rehabilitate the main canal with slope stabilization.  \n(iv)  Xaignabouli\u2019s Nam Phieng 1 and 2 RSP will install WCSs and canal lining for green \nsoybean production. All additional subprojects will undergo technical reviews to be \neligible for ADB financing. \n  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  The economic analysis followed ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, \ncomparing scenarios with and without the project, at a discount rate of 9%.18 The economic \ninternal rates of return for the RSPs range from 9% to 43%. For irrigation, financial returns per \nday increased by 30% to 80%, reflecting the high value of dry season crops and increased returns \nthat are above the nonagricultural market rate for casual labor. As the RSPs are nonrevenue-\ngenerating and the participating farmers are not contributing any capital or equity, a calculation of \nthe financial internal rates of return is not meaningful. The four RSPs will generate about \n160,000 days of paid labor per year. The incremental increases in household incomes provide \nthe resources for an irrigation service fee that is affordable and able to sustain operation and \nmaintenance costs. Switching values for the RSPs are robust, exceeding a 20% change in the \nmain parameters, except for Houaphan\u2019s Nam Pua RSP, which has a base case economic \ninternal rate of return of 9%, and has a switching value of 3% on projected benefits.19 \n \n \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2017.

A financial management assessment was conducted on MAF, DOI, the FNP governments, \nand PAFOs. The financial management risk is high.20 A financial management action plan was \nprepared taking into consideration the devolved implementation arrangements and which will \nmitigate risk, with consultant support. The risks will be further managed by adopting financial \nmanagement systems and procedures, based on double-entry accounting systems, including \nprovincial  accounting  modules  linked  via  cloud-based  internet  capabilities.  The  financial \nmanagement system will support the introduction of public sector double-entry accounting that \nwill interface with MAF\u2019s accounting system, along with capacity building for staff, with oversight \nfrom the program governance team.21 Government staff were trained in financial management \nduring the project design stage, and training continues during project start-up and implementation. \n \n23.  Procurement risks were assessed as medium\u2013high, but have been mitigated to low\u2013\nmedium as (i) the executing agency (MAF) and the central implementing agency (DOI) have \nprocurement experience in ADB projects, (ii) procurement staff have been trained, and (iii) loan \nimplementation  consultants  will  provide  procurement  support.  The  number  of  procurement \npackages has been minimized. The provincial implementing agencies have minimal experience \nrecruiting consultants following ADB procedures, so DOI will recruit consultants with ADB support \nbefore loan effectiveness. All procurement will be carried out in accordance with the ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  associated  project \nadministration instructions and staff instructions. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  MAF,  DOI,  and  each  PAFO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25.  FNP households derive 30%\u201350% of income from wet season rice. Most food-secure \nhouseholds allocate labor to off-farm employment, usually by men, which aggravates women\u2019s \ntime poverty.22 The project seeks to develop and enable the cultivation of HVCs through the \nprovision of DSIA, yielding returns three to four times those of wet season rice, and higher than \nlocal nonfarm wage rates. HVCs are labor-intensive and generate jobs, which can draw labor out \nof inappropriate land uses in the upper watershed catchments. The four RSPs are estimated to \ncreate paid jobs, equivalent to about $1 million income per annum. The project will support the \ngovernment policy for nutrition-sensitive agriculture and hygiene support for adolescent girls and \nwomen to address high levels of wasting and stunting by providing WASH infrastructure in homes, \nschools, and markets in 100 villages. \n \n26.  Gender. The project is classified gender equity as a theme. Gender analysis reveals that \nwomen have fewer opportunities to participate in public decision making; and less access to \ninformation, training, employment, and voice. Improved PRI will enable women to benefit from \nexpanded economic opportunities and access to social services. The project\u2019s gender action plan \npromotes (i) equal project benefits among women and men, including to job opportunities and \ncontrol over resources; (ii) a reduction in gender inequalities and social risks; (iii) increased \n                                                \n20 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Including the double-entry accounting packages and project financial management manuals. \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "    9 \n \nrepresentation of women in decision making; and (iv) the use of sex-disaggregated data. Women \nare central to DSIA and WASH and will have increased access to water, improved command \nareas, labor-saving technologies, and funds for matching grants.23 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n28.  Environment (category B). MAF and ADB have agreed on an environmental assessment \nand  review  framework.24  The  subprojects  will  not  infringe  on  protected  or  environmentally \nsensitive areas and will only require simple mitigation measures such as proper management of \nconstruction camps or storage of building materials. All subprojects are sited on existing irrigation \nschemes and have enough water during the dry season to support irrigation without adverse \nstream flow impacts. The project will provide training in Lao PDR good agricultural practice and \nwill improve the safety of produce and mitigate the risks associated with increased agrichemical \napplication. Each initial environmental examination for the four RSPs includes an environmental \nmanagement plan with publicly disclosed mitigation measures.  \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). MAF and ADB have agreed on a combined \nresettlement and ethnic group development framework. Due diligence carried out on the RSPs \n(i) revealed no social safeguards impacts on Xaignabouli\u2019s Nam Phieng 1 and 2 RSP and \nconsequently a due diligence plan was prepared; (ii) found social safeguard impacts for the other \nthree RSPs, leading to the preparation of land acquisition and resettlement plans; and (iii) publicly \ndisclosed all the plans.25 The land acquisition and resettlement plans are supported by public \nconsultation and disclosure, with minor impacts of land acquisition and compensation for roadside \ntrees, crops, or small structures within the right-of-way for which compensation, allowances, \nsurveys, monitoring, and reporting will be financed from ADB loan proceeds.26 MAF will monitor, \nevaluate, and report the impacts semiannually to ADB. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Impacts on indigenous peoples, referred to as ethnic \ngroups in the Lao PDR, are overwhelmingly positive as they are fully integrated into the subproject \ncommunities  and  will  share  in  the  project  benefits.  The  project  will  not  cause  physical \ndisplacement from traditional or customary lands, nor will it negatively impact the identity, culture, \nor customary livelihood systems of the ethnic groups. The combined resettlement and ethnic \ngroup development framework will be used to prepare resettlement and ethnic group development \nplans for each subproject. These plans will include mitigation measures to address impacts, \ninstitutional capacity development programs, a grievance redress mechanism, and compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \n \n \n                                                \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Resettlement and Ethnic Group Development Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 In the case of loss of land there are two compensation scenarios for a household as detailed in the Resettlement and \nEthnic Group Development Framework: (i) 9% or less loss - the household is eligible to make a voluntary land \ndonation or reach a negotiated settlement in accordance with the community participation framework; or (ii) 10% or \nmore loss \u2013 the household shall be compensated in cash, or in kind, as determined through consultation.  \n \n ", "10   \nF.
