The proposed technical assistance (TA) project for Provincial Development Strategies \nfor Selected Provinces in the Central Region continues a series of similar projects in the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC). The Asian Development Bank's first similar TA project on \nprovincial development strategies took place in Hebei Province in 2003. Encouraged by the \nsuccess of that TA project, the Government of the PRC asked ADB to develop a systematic \napproach  to  supporting  reforms  at  the  provincial  level.  Since  then,  other  provinces  have \nsubmitted proposals to the PRC's Ministry of Finance requesting similar ADB assistance. Thus \nfar, three TA projects have been approved for four provinces or autonomous regions: Hebei \nProvince, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and Gansu \nProvince (the latter two were combined into one TA project). \n \n2.  During the Country Programming Midterm Review Mission in 2006, the Government \nrequested that ADB provide two central provinces with similar assistance. During that mission \nand subsequent dialogue, ADB reconfirmed its commitment to supporting provincial strategies. \nAn ADB reconnaissance mission1 visited Hunan and Jiangxi provinces in October 2006. Staff in \nADB's PRC Resident Mission held follow-up meetings with Hunan and Jiangxi government \nofficials from March to September 2007. Consensus was reached on the TA project's goal, \nobjective, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, terms of reference for consulting services, and \nimplementation arrangements with the provincial governments and the Ministry of Finance.2  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The PRC consists of four regions\u2014eastern, central, western, and northeastern. The \ncentral  and  the  western  regions  lag  behind  the  eastern  region  in  social  and  economic \ndevelopment\u2014especially  in  industry,  rural  development,  infrastructure,  public  services,  and \nfiscal and financial reforms.3 The central region covers six provinces: Anhui, Henan, Hubei, \nHunan, Jiangxi, and Shanxi. Its average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $1,528 \nwas lower than the national average of $2,003 in 2006.4 \n4.  To reduce regional disparity, in 2004 Premier Wen Jiabao called for \u201cpromoting the rise \nof  the  central  region\u201d  in  his  annual  government  work  report.  The  Government  issued  the \nstrategic framework for promoting the rise of the central region in 2005.5 The Central Committee \nof the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued \u201cSuggestions for Promoting the \nRise of the Central Region\u201d in 2006. These policies aim to boost the central region through pro-\npoor development of agriculture, equipment manufacturing, logistics, renewable energy, rural \ninfrastructure, public services, and environmental improvement.  \n5.  In  2006,  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  announced  its \n\u201cDecision on Key Issues Relating to Building a Harmonious Socialist Society\u201d, which calls for \nbalanced and sustainable development. After continuous decentralization for the past 20 years \n                                                 \n1  The mission comprised David Dole and Junmei Yang from ADB's PRC Resident Mission, and Wei Wang from the \nMinistry of Finance. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 9 January 2007. \n3  ADB is already supporting development strategies in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Gansu Province and \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. \n4 All GDP estimates in this paper are from 2006, and so use the average exchange rate in 2006, $1 = 7.9718, to \nconvert GDP in RMB to yuan in US dollar. \n5  The Government has been issuing policies to promote the rise of the central region since 2004. The Central \nCommittee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued \u201cSuggestions for Promotion of Rise in \nthe Central Region\u201d.  Available : (http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2006/content_327809.htm). \n ", "2   \nand fiscal decentralization in the past 10 years, provincial governments must use their scarce \nresources more efficiently to deliver public services and promote socioeconomic development. \nTo achieve these results, provincial governments need to formulate their own development \nstrategies. While provincial governments are good at designing projects, they are weak in \ndeveloping inclusive and balanced socioeconomic development strategies. \n6.  Hunan Province has 67.32 million people. The per capita GDP was $1,483 in 2006, \nbelow the national average of $2,003. Of 122 counties in the province, 10 are \u201cnational poverty \ncounties\u201d.6 In 2006, 3.75 million people (5.57% of the total population) had incomes below the \ngovernment's official poverty line. Hunan\u2019s major development challenges and constraints are \nthe low level of industrialization, out-of-date technology, and high energy consumption. \n7.  To  boost  pro-poor  economic  development,  the  Hunan  government  published \nsuggestions  on  \u201cnew  industrialization\u201d  in  February  2007. 7  New  industrialization  means \nrestructuring of industries by integrating logistics and improving information and technology, \nenergy efficiency, and environmental protection. Equipment manufacturing is a key contributor \nto economic growth, and the State Council called for boosting equipment manufacturing in 2006. \nThe central region\u2014in particular Hunan\u2014is an important center of equipment manufacturing in \nthe PRC. In 2005, equipment manufacturing accounted for 10% of GDP and 40% of Hunan's \nindustrial output.  \n8.  Technology, logistics, and energy efficiency are critical to equipment manufacturing. The \nHunan government reviewed its industrial sectors in October, 2006, and decided to put more \nemphasis on equipment manufacturing, logistics, and energy efficiency. The Hunan government \nbelieves that new industrialization\u2014particularly equipment manufacturing\u2014will help narrow the \ngap between Hunan and other provinces. Thus, the Hunan development strategy will focus on \nnew industrialization, including equipment manufacturing, logistics, and energy conservation. \n9.  Jiangxi Province is an agriculture-oriented province of 43 million people, 63% of whom \nlive in rural areas. Per capita GDP was $1,339 in 2006, below the national per capita GDP of \n$2,003. Of 99 counties in Jiangxi, 21 are \u201cnational poverty counties\u201d. In 2006, 1.73 million \npeople, or 6.4% of the Jiangxi's rural population (4% of the total population), lived on incomes \nbelow the official poverty line. Agriculture accounted for 26.6% of the province's GDP in 2006. \nJiangxi\u2019s  development  challenges  and  constraints  include  imbalanced  rural  and  urban \ndevelopment, and inadequate rural infrastructure and public services. \n10.  To accelerate its rural development, Jiangxi pioneered the \"new countryside\" concept in \n2004.8 Government  officials  from  other  provinces  have  visited  Jiangxi  to  learn  about  the \nprovince\u2019s experience with implementing the \u201cnew countryside\u201d concept. To accelerate rural \ndevelopment, a comprehensive strategy for rural development is needed. Therefore, the Jiangxi \ngovernment has suggested that the development strategy should focus on implementing the \n\"new countryside\" concept. The TA project\u2019s recommendations to Jiangxi will also be shared \nwith other provinces in the central region.  \n                                                 \n6 The Government targets its poverty reduction programs at counties with relatively high numbers of rural poor. A \n\u201cnational poverty county\u201d is a target for poverty reduction programs from the central Government. Provincial \ngovernments also designate \u201cprovincial poverty counties\u201d. \n7  \u201cOpinions  to  Accelerate  New  Industrialization  by  Hunan  Party  Committee  and  Government\u201d  (Zhonggong \nHunanshengwei Hunansheng Renmin Zhengfu Guanyu Jiasu Tuijin Xinxing Gongyehua Jincheng De Ruogan \nYijian). No.3 (2007) Hunan, 2 February 2007. \n8  The \"new countryside\" concept refers to relatively developed industrial sectors in urban areas promoting social and \neconomic development in rural areas. The Jiangxi provincial government wishes to explore potential strategic \nmeasures and pilot sites on which to build the \"new countryside\", based on the policies and principles set by the \ncentral government and the situation on the ground in Jiangxi.  \n ", "  3\n11.  Major donors have not been involved in provincial development strategies in Hunan and \nJiangxi provinces. In a related initiative, a United Nations Development Program (UNDP) TA \nproject in Hunan is supporting the development of a system to track the province's progress in \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals9 and other socioeconomic development goals. \nThe UNDP\u2019s TA project will contribute to Hunan's provincial development strategy. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  Impact. The major impacts of the TA project will be the following: a more developed \nequipment  manufacturing  sector,  more  integrated  logistics,  higher  energy  efficiency,  and \nimproved  fiscal  and  financial  systems  in  Hunan;  and  improved  agricultural  structure,  rural \ninfrastructure, public services, and financial and fiscal systems in Jiangxi. \n13.  Outcome. The outcome of the TA project will be the following: new and improved plans, \npolicies and regulations on equipment manufacturing, logistics, and energy efficiency in Hunan; \nand agricultural modernization, rural infrastructure, public services, vocational  training, and \ngovernance in Jiangxi. \n14.  TA Scope. The TA project will assist in developing two strategies: a Hunan development \nstrategy  (part  1)  and  a  Jiangxi  development  strategy  (part  2).  Each  part  will  produce \nrecommendations  for  the  Hunan  and  Jiangxi  provincial  governments  on  how  to  achieve \nbalanced and sustainable economic and social development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  Part 1: Hunan Development Strategy. Part 1 of the TA will formulate a development \nstrategy for the Hunan provincial government that utilizes its natural advantages and better \nintegrates with the strategic framework for promoting the rise of the central region. This strategy \nwill  help  the  Hunan  government  achieve  inclusive,  sustainable,  balanced,  and  pro-poor \nsocioeconomic development via new industrialization.  \n16.  Output.  The  Hunan  development  strategy  will  include  a  main  report  on  new \nindustrialization supported by four subreports on (i) equipment manufacturing; (ii) coordinated \nlogistics;  (iii)  energy  saving,  renewable  energy,  and  environmental  protection;  and \n(iv) institutional innovation, institutional planning, institutional management, governance, fiscal \nand tax policies, and investment financing mechanisms related to the sectors in points (i) to (iii). \n17.  Part 1 will include the following key activities: (i) conducting a literature review; (ii) site \nvisits and meetings with governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations; (iii) \nanalyzing problems and proposing solutions related to social and economic development, with \nfocus on equipment manufacturing, logistics, energy conservation, and environmental protection; \n(iv) analyzing problems and proposing solutions related to institutional innovation, institutional \nplanning, institutional management, and fiscal, tax, and financing mechanisms to support the \nthree sectors in points i to iii of paragraph 16; (v) recommending best international practices \nrelevant to local situations; (vi) organizing the inception workshop, the midterm report review \nworkshop, and the final draft report review workshop; (vii) conducting field studies to expose \nHunan government officials to relevant experience elsewhere; (viii) sharing the findings of this \nTA project with donors, provincial government agencies, academic institutions, and civil society \n                                                 \n9 For a recent review of the Millenium Development Goals, see ADB, United Nations Development Program, and \nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific: \u201cThe Millenium Development Goals: \nProgress in Asia and the Pacific 2007, Bangkok, October 2007. \n ", "4   \norganizations in the central region and other regions through a press conference and seminars; \nand (ix) publishing the final report and posting it on the ADB website. \n18.  Part  2:  Jiangxi  Development  Strategy.  Part 2 of the TA project will formulate a \ndevelopment strategy for the Jiangxi provincial government to achieve inclusive, sustainable, \nand balanced rural socioeconomic development. The study will cover five topics: (i) agriculture-\nrelated industries, (ii) rural institutional innovation, (iii) rural planning and management, (iv) rural \nfiscal and tax systems, and (v) village-level governance. \n19.  Output.  The  Jiangxi  rural  development  strategy  will  produce  one  main  report  on \nimplementing the \"new countryside\" concept, supported by nine subreports on (i) rural industrial \nclusters; (ii) rural infrastructure; (iii) rural public services; (iv) rural grassroots governance and \norganizational reforms; (v) rural vocational training; (vi) agricultural development, including rural \nproperty rights reform; (vii) rural ecology; (viii) rural logistics development; and (ix) institutional \ninnovation, institutional planning, institutional management, fiscal reforms, tax reforms, and \nfinancing reforms to support implementing the \u201cnew countryside\u201d concept. \n20.  Part 2 will include the following activities: (i) conducting a literature review; (ii) site visits \nand  meetings  with  governments,  academic  institutions,  and  civil  society  organizations;  (iii) \nanalyzing problems and proposing solutions related to socioeconomic development, with a \nfocus  on  rural  industries,  infrastructure,  public  services,  grassroots  governance,  vocational \ntraining, agriculture, ecology, and logistics; (iv) analyzing problems and proposing solutions \nrelated to institutional innovation, institutional planning, institutional management, and fiscal \nmechanisms, tax mechanisms, and financing mechanisms; (v) recommending best international \npractices relevant to local situations; (vi) organizing an inception workshop, a midterm report \nreview workshop, and a final draft report review workshop bringing together government officials, \nacademic institutions, civil society organizations, and donors to discuss key issues and evaluate \nthe consultants' findings and recommendations; (vii) conducting field studies to help Jiangxi \ngovernment officials learn about experiences elsewhere; (viii) disseminating the findings to \ndonors, provincial government agencies, academic institutions, civil society organizations in the \ncentral region and other regions through a press conference and seminars; and (ix) publishing \nthe final report as a book and posting it on the ADB website. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The total estimated cost of the TA is $1,300,000 equivalent, of which $1,000,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA fund provided by ADB will be \ndivided between Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces with each being allocated an amount of $500,000. \nContributions by the Hunan and Jiangxi governments, estimated at $300,000 equivalent, will \ncover  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space  and  meeting  venues,  furniture, \nadministrative support, and logistics. Appendix 2 details cost estimates and the financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The Executing Agency for part 1 will be the Hunan Finance Department (HFD); the \nExecuting Agency for part II will be the Jiangxi Finance Department (JFD). In each province a \nproject steering committee will guide the TA activities. The committees will be led by a vice \ngovernor, and will consist of senior officials from provincial government agencies, and experts \nfrom academic institutions.  \n23.  HFD  and  JFD  will  coordinate  with  provincial  agencies  to  implement,  monitor,  and \nevaluate the results. They will provide office space with telecommunication access, counterpart \nstaff, and material, information, data, and logistical support required by the consultants. Before \n ", "  5\nthe TA project starts, HFD and JFD will each appoint a provincial project coordinator who will \nliaise and coordinate within his or her province, and with ADB and the consultants. \n24.  The TA project will be implemented over 18 months, from February 2008 to July 2009. \nAll procurement will follow ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe procured equipment will be handed over to the executing agencies at completion of the TA \nproject. A consulting firm will be selected for each part using quality-and cost-based selection \n(QCBS) ; the consulting firms will undertake all TA activities except the studies on fiscal and tax \nreforms (for which three individual consultants will be hired). To select TA consultants, the 80/20 \nquality/cost ratio for QCBS will be adopted.10 A simplified technical proposal will be required. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Part 1 will require 5.5 person-months of \ninternational consulting inputs and 44 person-months of national consulting inputs. Part 2 will \nrequire 5 person-months of international consulting inputs and 39 person-months of national \nconsulting inputs. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 2. Disbursement will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook, 1992, as amended from time to \ntime. ADB will establish an advance payment facility with each Executing Agency to facilitate \nimplementation  of  the  TA  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  of  Technical \nAssistance Grants. \n \n25.  Two national consultants will be appointed as team leaders for part 1 and part 2, and will \nbe responsible for preparing the main reports and supervising the national and international \nconsultants. The consultants will carry out the tasks in a consultative manner while encouraging \nstakeholder participation. The consultants will complete reports and activities to a high standard.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Provincial Development Strategies for \nSelected Provinces in the Central Region, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n10 QCBS is a method of selecting a consulting firm based on both the quality of the technical proposals and the costs \nin the financial proposals. The technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% and the costs a weight of 20%. \nThis is the standard approach for QCBS selection.
