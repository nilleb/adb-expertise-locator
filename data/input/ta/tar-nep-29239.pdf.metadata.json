The  Government  of  Nepal  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical \nassistance1 (TA) for strengthening selected rural financial institutions (RFIs), especially the \nAgricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN), the key RFI. During fact-finding in October \n2002, the Government and ADB agreed to shift the TA from 2002 to 2003 to incorporate the \nfindings of the Financial and Operational Review of ADBN.2 Subsequently, an ADB Mission in \nJune 2003 formulated the TA in consultation with Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank; \nADBN; International Monetary Fund (IMF); and German Agency for Technical Cooperation \n(GTZ). The TA is included in the 2003 TA program. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nepal is an overwhelmingly rural and agrarian economy. Over 85% of the population live \nin rural areas and nearly 80% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture and related activities. \nSmallholders  and  marginal  farmers  operate  90%  of  the  2.7  million  agricultural  holdings. \nAgriculture sector growth has been low and employment, either farm or nonfarm, is mainly in \nsubsistence activities typical of poor and low-income households. This has resulted in a poverty \nincidence of 38.7% and a per capita gross domestic product of $241, the lowest in South Asia. \nRural poverty incidence is estimated at 44% and inequalities between rural and urban areas \nhave increased. In addition, with a population growth rate of 2.2%, Nepal faces the challenge of \nabsorbing about 300,000 new laborers, mostly rural, every year. Ongoing insurgency has made \nit difficult to maintain, let alone increase economic growth. \n3.  Poverty reduction is thus the key challenge for Nepal. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy prioritizes macroeconomic policies that support poverty reduction \nthrough broad-based economic growth, especially in agriculture, along with emphasis on the \nsocial  sector,  disadvantaged  groups,  and  improved  governance.  Within  agriculture,  the \nAgriculture Perspective Plan (APP) of the Government aims to reduce the sector\u2019s structural \nconstraints through emphasis on five inputs\u2014fertilizers, irrigation, roads, power, and extension \nservices\u2014and four outputs\u2014high-value crops, agribusiness, forestry, and livestock. Access to \nrural finance (RF)3 is a critical input for realizing both poverty reduction4 and APP goals.  \n \n4.  The Government supported the emergence of a diverse range of RFIs for meeting the \nfinancing demand5 of the rural sector. The formal RF sector, supervised or registered with NRB, \ncomprises 322 rural branches of commercial banks, ADBN with 447 branches, Small Farmers \nDevelopment Bank (SFDB) with 134 outlets, 10 development banks with 113 branches, 34 \nsavings and credit cooperative societies, and 30 microfinance nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs). The semiformal sector comprises government-sponsored rural credit programs, about \n                                                 \n1  The TA appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 August 2003. \n2  TA 3580\u2013NEP: Subcluster 5, Financial and Operational Review of Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal and \nNepal Industrial Development Corporation associated with ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Corporate and Financial \nGovernance Project. Manila.   \n3  RF in this document, includes savings credit, and payment services. From the client\u2019s perspective, RF can be \nclassified as financial services provided to rural farm and nonfarm households, a large proportion of which are poor \nand  low-income  households.  While  RFIs  also  serve  poor,  low-income  households,  and  the  non-poor,  the \nmicrofinance institutions exclusively focus on the poor. Microfinance is primarily rural. In this document the term \n\u201cRF\u201d or \u201cRFI\u201d is inclusive of \u201cmicrofinance\u201d or \u201cmicrofinance institutions,\u201d respectively. The term \u201cmicrofinance\u201d or \n\u201cmicrofinance institutions\u201d is used only for specific microfinance related reference. \n4  The poverty partnership agreement between Nepal and ADB aims to reduce poverty to less than 10% by 2017.  \n5  The annual aggregate demand, including that under the APP, is estimated at NRs20 billion per annum. ", "2  \n1,600 savings and credit cooperative societies registered under the Cooperatives Act, and \nabout 60 multisectoral NGOs. The Rural Microfinance Development Center6 wholesales funds \nfor onlending to the rural poor. The informal sector comprises moneylenders, traders, friends, \nrelatives, and about 12,000 community organizations. \n \n5.  Despite the extensive network, the RFIs have inadequate outreach and are concentrated \nin the plains. They collectively disburse about NRs7 billion per annum and the outreach is \nestimated at 23% of the rural population. The majority of the rural households rely on informal \ncredit. However, only 13% of such borrowings are for productive assets and the cost of credit \nfrom informal sources leaves little, if any, surplus with the households. In addition, the RF sector \nis characterized by weak governance, poor repayment rates, high transaction costs, recurring \nlosses, and high nonperforming loans (NPLs).7 The high-risk perception of RF has deterred \ncommercial banks from expanding their RF portfolio.8 The contribution of RF to rural growth \nthrough investments in agriculture and nonfarm activities for value addition and employment \ngeneration in rural economy thus remains unfulfilled. \n \n6.  Concerned about the systemic weaknesses, the Government has anchored RF sector \nreforms with the ongoing financial sector reforms to improve the policy and legal framework, \nenhance  private  sector  participation,  strengthen  governance  and  supervision,  and  improve \naccounting and auditing. Consistent with the Government\u2019s reform agenda, ADB prioritized its \nassistance to enhance the access of poor households to microfinance. ADB assistance to the \nfinancial sector aims to strengthen corporate and financial governance, and includes portfolio \naudit,  diagnostic  study,  and  restructuring  plan  for  ADBN  (footnote  2).  Building  on  these \ninitiatives, the TA and the pipeline RF sector development (RFSD) loan for 2005 aim to develop \nsustainable RFIs.  \n \n7.  With the largest branch network in the country, ADBN accounts for about 55% of the \nrural  credit  outstanding  and  three  fourths  of  agriculture  credit.  ADBN  deposits  and  loan \noutstanding  amounted  to  NRs21  billion  and  NRs23  billion,  respectively,  at  end-2002.  The \naverage outstanding loan size of NRs5,164 suggest access to low-income households. SFDB, a \nfully-owned ADBN subsidiary, wholesales funds to small farmers development program (SFDP) \ninitiated  by  ADBN  in  1975.  GTZ  is  assisting  SFDP  clients  to  organize  into  small  farmers \ncooperatives and link them with SFDB.  \n \n8.  As a government-owned bank, ADBN for the most part operated under a paradigm that \nrepressed viable financial intermediation through controls on pricing and client selection. The \ndiagnostic study highlighted weak governance, inefficiencies, and heavy overheads. In addition, \ndeficiencies in loan appraisal and delinquency management contributed to low repayments and \naccumulation of NPLs. Portfolio audit assessed ADBN\u2019s NPL at 38% of the portfolio in terms of \nthe prudential norms applied to commercial banks in Nepal compared with the 28% reported by \nADBN.9 On organizational and institutional aspects, the diagnostic study found that governance, \ntransparency,  corporate  planning,  management  information  system  (MIS),  human  resource \nmanagement, accounting, and auditing require significant improvements. Channelling numerous \ngovernment programs diluted the core financial intermediation focus of ADBN and contributed to \n                                                 \n6  Implementing agency for ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed Loan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Rural Microfinance Project. Manila.  \n7  ADB. 2000. Rural Finance Development in Nepal: A Medium-term Strategy. Manila.  \n8  Nepal Bank Limited and Rastriya Banijya Bank, with 95% of commercial bank rural branches, have closed 55 rural \nbranches. Further branch closures, mainly rural, are expected as part of the World Bank-assisted restructuring. \n9  Restated financial statements reflect a net loss and capital erosion. NPLs are as high as 48% when internationally \naccepted prudential norms are applied.  ", "  3\npoor  portfolio  quality.  SFDB,  SFDP,  and  small  farmers  cooperative-related  responsibilities, \nwhich together account for about one fourth of ADBN\u2019s loan portfolio, overstretch ADBN\u2019s \nmanagerial  capacity.  Accordingly,  the  diagnostic  study  recommended  that  SFDP-related \nresponsibilities be transferred to SFDB and the organizational and financial status of SFDB be \nseparately evaluated to ensure its sustainability as a microfinance institution. \n \n9.  The Restructuring Plan for the Commercialization of ADBN,10 based on the portfolio \naudit and diagnostic study findings, and developed with ADBN and Government participation, \naims to transform ADBN into a sustainable bank with the following reform framework to be \nimplemented over a 3-year period: \n(i)  Legal,  ownership,  and  governance.  ADBN  will  be  incorporated  under  the \nproposed Banks and Financial Institutions Ordinance11 with a board of directors \ndrawn from professionals. The majority equity stake over the medium term will \nremain with the Government, as private sector participation is unlikely unless the \nRestructuring Plan is completed.  \n \n(ii)  Financial restructuring. Capitalization and adequate provisioning for bad and \ndoubtful assets will be undertaken based on NRB norms for commercial banks.  \n \n(iii)  Organizational restructuring. The organization will be rationalized around a \nprofit-center concept, and rightsized through a voluntary separation scheme.  \n \n(iv)  Institutional strengthening. Business processes including products, services, \nsystems, and procedures will be reoriented; information technology and MIS \nsystem upgraded; and training capacity and staff skills enhanced. \n \n10.  ADBN has endorsed the Restructuring Plan, the implementation of which is also a \nrequirement  under  IMF\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (footnote  11).   The \nRestructuring Plan requires ADBN to enhance its training capacity for mainstreaming RF best \npractices. Priority support areas identified by the Restructuring Plan for skills development \ninclude (i) corporate planning for a structured approach to institutional transformation; (ii) credit \nappraisal and loan management for improving the repayment rate and minimizing NPLs; (iii) risk \nmanagement for reducing credit, price, operational, and liquidity risks; and (iv) accounting, audit, \nand  internal  controls  for  enhancing  good  governance  and  transparency.  These  skills  are \nnecessary  to  adopt  the  profit-center  concept,  which  requires  decision-making  capacity  at \nregional and branch levels before personnel are realigned. \n \n11.  The TA supports implementation of the Restructuring Plan through capacity building for \nthe Central Training Institute (CTI) and regional training centers (RTCs) for training in the priority \nareas (para. 10). This will contribute to the strengthening of the RF sector because a reformed \nADBN,  considering  its  nationwide  network  often  at  unserved  remote  rural  areas,  can \nsignificantly enhance outreach. The sustainability of  ADBN  is also  important to encourage \ncommercial banks to actively pursue RF operations (para. 5 and footnote 8). The TA will allow \nactive ADB participation in implementing the Restructuring Plan and facilitate the design of the \nproposed RFSD loan. \n                                                 \n10 Developed as part of TA 3580\u2013NEP: Subcluster 5 (footnote 2).  \n11 The enactment of the Banks and Financial Institutions Ordinance governing all financial institutions is a condition \nfor the $72 million Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility of the IMF approved on 14 November 2003.  ", "4  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The objective of the TA is to enhance the capacity of CTI and RTCs to offer training \nservices for the professional development of ADBN staff. Enhanced training capacity and the \nresulting staff skills are critical to the successful implementation of the Restructuring Plan and to \ntransform ADBN into a sustainable bank that can significantly contribute to poverty reduction \nand the APP goals. The TA will support the following:  \n(i)  The  corporate  plan  including  training  plan,  training  materials,  and \noperating manuals. This will cover: (a) training on developing and updating a \ncorporate plan; (b) the corporate plan and a training plan; (c) curricula to be \nconducted through CTI and RTCs; (d) training materials and manuals for credit \nappraisal for farm and nonfarm activities and loan management procedures; (e) \ntraining materials and manuals for risk management best practices and plan for \nintroducing risk management policies and procedures; and (f) training materials \nand manuals for internal audit and for mainstreaming accounting codes and \npractices consistent with commercial banks.  \n(ii)  Training senior management and staff. This will cover: (a) training for trainers \nof CTI and RTCs; and (b) training in corporate planning, credit appraisal, loan \nportfolio  management,  risk  management,  and  internal  audit  and  accounting \nprocedures for 100 senior management staff and 500 operational staff of ADBN, \nthrough CTI and RTCs\u2019 trainers.  \n(iii)  Financial and operational review of SFDB. The review will cover: (i) detailed \nportfolio audit and diagnostic study of SFDB including SFDP; (b) assessment of \nthe  quality  of  ADBN  loan  and  investment  in  SFDB  and  SFDP;  and  (c) \nrestructuring options along with implementation plan for SFDB. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n13.  The corporate plan including the training plan will ensure that TA inputs are consistent \nwith and contribute to the Restructuring Plan objective (para. 9). Priority staff are the managers \nat all levels, who should have improved knowledge and skills both to manage the change and to \nlead the on-the-job training that will be essential for successfully implementing the Restructuring \nPlan. Implementation will allow flexibility to modify team compositions as the work progresses. \nAppropriate methodologies will be applied to capture the perspectives of staff for continuous \nimprovements in design and delivery of training inputs that will qualify staff for (i) new posts, (ii) \nnew responsibilities in current posts, and (iii) responsibilities of the next higher post. After the \ntraining of trainers, CTI and RTCs\u2019 trainers will design and conduct training courses under the \nsupervision of the TA consultants. This activity will (i) ensure that CTI and RTCs develop skills \nfor meeting evolving training needs, and (ii) facilitate replication of training either through ADBN \nfunds or the proposed RFSD loan support. Similarly, SFDB review will provide restructuring \noptions that can be considered for funding by the proposed RFSD loan.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $610,000 equivalent, comprising $285,000 in \nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $325,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Germany in the amount of $15,000 equivalent, ", "  5\nto  be  administered  by  ADB,  and  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  in  the  amount  of  $500,000 \nequivalent. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange costs and $230,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency  cost.  ADBN  will  finance  the  remaining  $95,000  of  the  local  currency  cost.  Cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADBN will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will form a TA steering committee \ncomprising  the  general  manager;  deputy  general  manager;  division  chiefs  of  banking \noperations, branch operations, and microfinance; the chief of CTI; and representatives of RTCs, \nSFDB,  and  NRB.  The  TA  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  general  manager,  will  be \nresponsible for overall implementation. ADBN will provide offices at CTI for the consultants and \nplace the equipment purchased under the TA at the disposal of the consultants for the duration \nof the TA. In addition, ADBN will provide, on a full-time basis for the duration of the TA, (i) one \nsenior staff member of CTI as counterpart staff for the consultants, (ii) secretarial services, (iii) \nlocal communications facilities, (iv) one vehicle to the consultants for travel in Kathmandu, and \n(v) venues and assistance for all workshops and training sessions, in Kathmandu and in the \nfield. \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months, from February 2004 to October 2004. \nTripartite review meetings involving the Government, the TA consultant, and ADB and GTZ will \nbe organized by ADBN thrice during the TA period in conjunction with ADB missions to review \nimplementation and resolve any outstanding issue. The general manager of ADBN will chair the \nmeetings, and members of the TA steering committee will attend the meetings. International \nconsulting services of 10 person-months and domestic consulting services of 30 person-months \nwill  be  required.  The  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nconsultants will be specialists in training, corporate planning, credit appraisal, risk management, \naudit and accounting, MIS, and diagnostic studies. They will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging of domestic consultants. The quality- and cost-based selection method with simplified \ntechnical proposals will be used in selecting the consulting firm.  \n17.  The TA consultants will prepare (i) an inception report including a detailed work program, \nto be submitted within 3 weeks of the start of the TA and to be discussed at the initial tripartite \nreview meeting; (ii) quarterly progress reports on overall work progress during the period under \nreview, the work program for the following quarter, and any outstanding issue; (iii) an interim \nreport presenting draft outputs, to be submitted within 6 months of the start of the TA and to be \ndiscussed at the interim tripartite  review  meeting; (iv) a  draft final report compiling all  TA \nactivities  and  consultants\u2019  recommendations,  to  be  submitted  at  least  1  month  before  TA \ncompletion and to be discussed at the final tripartite review meeting; and (v) a final report at the \ncompletion of the TA for final evaluation jointly by ADBN, ADB, and GTZ.  \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $15,000 to \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Government of Germany, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Nepal \nfor Strengthening Selected Rural Financial Institutions, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.
