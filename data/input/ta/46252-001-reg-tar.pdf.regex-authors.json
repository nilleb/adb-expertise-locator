INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) strategic framework for 2012\u201320221 identifies \nclimate change as a priority for the GMS economic corridor development agenda. Individual \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in the GMS have initiated efforts to integrate climate \nchange  adaptation  into  national  development  strategies  and  policies,  but  this  has  not  yet \ntranslated into agendas for cities. Under Strategy 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nidentifies environmentally sustainable growth, including climate change, as a key development \nconcern and a core area for ADB operations.2 Promoting climate-resilient development and \nencouraging climate-friendly urban development are two key priorities for action under ADB\u2019s \nclimate  change  agenda.3  ADB's  regional  departments  have  formulated  climate  change \nimplementation plans to effectively mainstream climate change concerns in country partnership \nstrategies. ADB\u2019s urban operational plan also places high importance on adaptation to climate \nchange, and infrastructure investments and enhancements are seen as part of the \u201ccompetitive \ncities\u201d agenda, to ensure a sustainable urban future. \n \n2.  The regional capacity development technical assistance (TA), GMS: Climate Resilience in \nCities, was conceptualized in response to the request for assistance with urban climate change \nadaptation, articulated in workshops for preparing the GMS corridor towns development projects \nin Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam during 2011\u2013\n2012.4 The project cities identified the need to facilitate policy dialogue and knowledge exchange \non climate resilience.5  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Urban areas in the GMS are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The \nincreasing frequency and severity of extreme climate events (such as floods, droughts, and \ntropical storms), rising sea level, and threats to infrastructure and population centers pose \nserious challenges to sustainable development across the GMS. The extensive coastline and \nseasonal variability associated with tropical monsoons makes the GMS countries especially \nvulnerable to climate change, impacting not only agriculture, but also manufacturing and service \nsectors. The poor are particularly at risk as they tend to live in environmentally fragile locations, \ndepend for their livelihood on sectors that are especially prone to climate change, and do not \nhave adequate savings to recover from disasters. Further, their tenuous access to adaptation \ntechnologies and institutional support make them particularly vulnerable. \n \n4.  Rapid urbanization is taking place in Southeast Asia, with cities in the region expanding \nfive times faster than those in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD). Urban growth in the GMS in the 50-100 years is expected to be \nprimarily in small and medium-sized cities and peri-urban areas along existing and new growth \ncorridors.  Rapid  urbanization  is  expected  to  increase  built-up  areas  substantially.  As  local \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n5  The TA is included in the current country partnership strategy for the Lao PDR, but not yet in the country partnership \nstrategies for Cambodia and Viet Nam. It is not included in the country operations business plans of Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, and Viet Nam. The required concept clearance was obtained from the office of the Vice-President for Operations 2 \non 30 May 2012. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 July 2012. \n ", "2 \nimpacts of climate disasters are experienced, the consequences of not having urban climate \nchange adaptation policies will be significant. Cities will need to master the challenges of \nadaptation. \n \n5.   To cope with climate change, GMS countries have initiated national climate change \nmitigation and adaptation policies. However, progress in implementing subnational policies to \naddress adaptation, especially in urban areas, has been limited.  Many cities are unable to plan \nand implement climate change adaptation measures primarily because of (i) lack of policy-\nrelevant  information,  (ii)  technical  barriers,  (iii)  financial  limitations,  and  (iv)  institutional \nconstraints. Further, national climate change policies have not yet been translated into local \nclimate adaptation policies for urban areas. For example, in Cambodia and the Lao PDR, \nclimate change dialogue focusing on urban areas has only been seriously initiated in towns \nsuch as Sihanoukville in Cambodia and Luang Prabang in the Lao PDR. However, Viet Nam is \nan exception as the Viet Nam Urban Forum recently initiated the Urban Strategy for Climate \nChange Adaptation.7 However policies developed for large cities may not always be appropriate \nfor small and medium-sized towns. \n \n6.  The  TA  will  address  these  barriers  through  policy  dialogue  and  the  preparation  of \nappropriate guidebooks, with a focus on selected towns such as Battambang in Cambodia, \nKaysone Phomvihane in the Lao PDR, and Dong Ha in Viet Nam. These towns were selected \nbecause of their unique characteristics of riverine and coastal flood vulnerability representing a \nlarge flood-prone watershed area (Battambang, Tonle Sap Basin), the seasonally changing and \nflood-prone Mekong River (Kaysone Phomvihane), and proximity to the typhoon-prone coastline \nto be affected by sea level rise (Dong Ha).8 All three towns have diverse geographies, needs, \nand capacity; but each is highly vulnerable to natural disasters and the impacts of climate \nchange. \n \n7.  The TA will create a platform for exchange of adaptation relevant information among \nsmall and medium-sized towns. Policy dialogue on adaptation will help formulate structural and \nnonstructural measures, such as building construction regulations and development of criteria \nand incentives for the certification of green buildings in line with the identified issues. Likewise, \npreparation of guidebooks on locally relevant adaptation approaches and technologies will be \nuseful to disseminate appropriate and low-cost solutions to other  small and  medium-sized \ntowns.  \n \n8.  The  TA  will  build  on  experiences  with  other  ADB-supported  projects  and  promote \nsynergies with relevant projects in the GMS.  For example, recent ADB assistance to the GMS \nhas focused on biodiversity management,9 spatial technologies for climate modeling as a tool to \naid decision making for identifying hazard areas and formulating zoning laws,10 and assessing \nclimate change vulnerability in the energy and transport sectors in Viet Nam.11 In terms of \ngender-responsive tools for climate change adaptation, ADB is working on mitigation measures \n                                                 \n7  The Viet Nam Urban Forum is coordinated by the Ministry of Construction and assisted by various development-\npartner-funded initiatives. For instance, the World Bank Institute has developed an online training course for \nclimate change adaptation and plans to pilot this web-based training in Viet Nam. \n8  Additional cities to participate could be Phnom Penh (Cambodia), Vientiane (Lao PDR), and Da Nang (Viet Nam). \n9  ADB. 2005.

The TA will collaborate extensively with the GMS corridor towns development projects in \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam in which investments will cover environmental urban \ninfrastructure  (drainage  and  flood  control,  solid  waste  management,  wastewater  treatment, \nurban roads and drainage, and river embankments) in 10 towns along the southern and east\u2013\nwest economic corridors.14 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the TA is more socially inclusive and climate-resilient urban \ninfrastructure developed in GMS cities. The outcome will be enhanced understanding of climate \nchange impacts and adaptation options by key stakeholders in GMS cities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will assist small and medium-sized GMS towns in sharing knowledge and \nconducting policy dialogue on climate change adaptation. Participating towns will learn \nabout  appropriate  and  available  tools  and  processes  necessary  to  adapt  to  climate \nchange. The policy dialogue and cross-learning will be supported by a handbook on \ngood practices from the region and internationally. The TA will strengthen local policy \nframeworks, and help cities identify suitable solutions and approaches, and the means to \nimplement them. Under the ensuing loans for the three GMS countries, various climate change \nadaptation infrastructure investments are being proposed; their implementation will commence in \n2013. As a supplementary activity to the loan investment projects, the TA will help ensure that \nthe climate-proofing measures for different infrastructure investments are adhered to in all the \nsubprojects of the 10 corridor towns during preparation of the detailed engineering design, \nimplementation of construction activities, and operation and maintenance. \n \n12.  Output  1:  Knowledge-sharing  workshops  and  policy  dialogue.  Knowledge-\nsharing  and  dialogue  events  (seminars,  workshops,  study  tours,  and  cross-learning \namong  peers)15  will  focus  on  citywide  responses.  The  dialogue  will  involve  local \nstakeholders  (government  and  private),  and  address  possible  partnerships  between  these \nstakeholders. The dialogue is intended to translate to better policies and practice, and to \ncontribute to the handbook for resilient cities (output 2). The policy dialogue will take into \naccount innovations of climate adaptation in the GMS and beyond, and test their applicability in \nsmall and medium-sized towns. The dialogue participants will most likely be members of the \nrespective project implementation units of the project towns, and representatives from local \nnongovernment organizations and women\u2019s unions. Special efforts will be made to involve \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for Harnessing Climate Change Mitigation Initiatives to Benefit Women.

Additional grant resources of $3.5 million may be available for the Greater Mekong Subregion Livelihood \nSupport for Corridor Towns through investments in market buildings and microfinance for market vendors. \n15 Locations  to  be  considered  for  dialogue  events  due  to  their  relevant  experiences  in  climate  adaptation \ninfrastructure are Sihanoukville (Cambodia), Luang Prabang (Lao PDR), Da Nang or Can Tho (Viet Nam). \n ", "4 \nvulnerable communities including senior citizens, children, and youth.  The dialogue process \nwill raise awareness and generate support for the resilience planning process. It is expected to \nresult  in  the  development  of  locally  appropriate  policies and  practices  for  climate-resilient \ninfrastructure development (flood control and drainage, adaptation of water and sanitation \nfacilities, and solid waste management), local building codes and zoning laws, as well social \nand gender aspects of resilience. The dialogues will also (i) identify and document coping \nmechanisms, especially those that are indigenous in nature in the selected corridor towns; and \n(ii) identify policy mechanisms that will institutionalize these coping mechanisms. \n \n13.   Output 2: Development of a handbook for climate-resilient cities in the Greater \nMekong Subregion. The handbook (in English, Khmer, Lao, and Vietnamese languages) will \nfocus on climate adaptation responses for urban infrastructure, such as flood control and \ndrainage, water and sanitation, wastewater treatment, and solid waste management. It will also \nprovide a user-friendly, step-by-step approach to develop an action plan for short-, medium-, \nand  long-term  structural  and  nonstructural  measures  designed  to  increase  urban  climate \nresilience and focus on tools appropriate for the local situation of GMS cities.16 Towns will be \nencouraged  to  customize  the  handbook  based  on  their  prior  planning  and  capacity.  The \nhandbook may include geographic information system maps that illustrate current and future \nvulnerabilities of neighborhoods and communities. The handbook will include an inventory of \ncurrent and future plans for town development in order to assess gaps and needs as a basis for \nframing resilience measures. The options for financing resilience measures and considerations \nfor scaling up various resilience measures and practices will also be documented. In the long \nrun, the handbook is expected to be a key vehicle for mainstreaming adaptation and disaster \nrisk reduction into urban planning. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nNordic Development Fund, and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2014. ADB will be the \nexecuting agency with the Urban Development and Water Division, Southeast Asia Department \nas the focal point. ADB will establish a TA team comprising staff from the Urban Development \nand Water Division, which will monitor TA activities, provide guidance, and give input and \nfeedback on a regular basis. The team will work closely with other Southeast Asia Department \nclimate change-related projects, and the GMS Environmental Operations Centre to ensure that \nthe  TA  complements  their  efforts.  The  team  will  liaise  with  partner  organizations  actively \ninvolved in similar activities. The TA implementing agencies are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Cambodia: Ministry of Public Works and Transport. The work of the implementing \nagency will be supported by a steering committee, proposed to consist of the \nMinistry of Environment; and the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning \nand Construction. \n(ii)  Lao PDR: Ministry of Public Works and Transport. The work of the implementing \nagency will be supported by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. \n                                                 \n16 The manual will benefit from work by the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, supported by the \nRockefeller Foundation, and Climate Cities Initiative, supported by the Clinton Foundation. \n ", "    5 \n(iii)  Viet Nam: Provincial People\u2019s Committee of Quang Tri Province. The work of the \nimplementing agency will be supported by the Ministry of Construction and the \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment.17 \n \n16.  The  TA  will  require  the  services  of  a  consulting  firm,  with  a  team  of  experts  with \nexperience and a track record in climate adaptation projects, urban development, and project \nmanagement. ADB will recruit the firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The quality- and cost-based selection method will have a technical and financial ratio of \n80:20.  ADB  will  also  recruit  a  regional  development  specialist  using  individual  consultant \nselection.  The  specialist,  to  be  based  at  ADB  headquarters,  will  provide  technical  and \nadministrative support for the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The experiences and lessons from this TA will be disseminated through handbooks to \ngovernments, the private sector, and agencies working on developing and financing innovative, \nenvironmental, and pro-poor urban infrastructure for climate resilient cities. \n \nIV.
