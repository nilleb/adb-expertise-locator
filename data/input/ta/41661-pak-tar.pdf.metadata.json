INTRODUCTION \n1.  The successful Asian economies\u2014the newly industrialized economies of Malaysia and \nThailand, and, more recently, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Viet Nam\u2014have \nchanged in two key ways over the past three decades. They are not only significantly bigger, \nthey are also significantly different. What sets the successful Asian economies apart, beyond \ntheir high growth rates, is their rapid, intense structural transformation. Their forms of output and \nemployment have been dramatically altered. Resources have moved from agriculture into high \nvalue-added sectors in industry and services. Production has diversified, and firms have learned \nhow to manufacture and export a more sophisticated and technologically advanced range of \nproducts. Labor productivity in these nations has grown rapidly.  \n \n2.  Analysis of the extent and depth of structural transformation of Pakistan\u2019s economy \nmight provide an answer to this question. Growth and structural transformation are directly \nrelated. Countries do not grow by simply reproducing themselves on a larger scale. Generally\u2014\nunless all sectors expand at identical rates\u2014economies change as they grow, in terms what \nthey produce as well how they produce it. They use different inputs, including new methods of \nproduction. The successful economies have generated new activities that are characterized by \nhigher productivity and increasing returns to scale. The transitions to these new patterns of \nproduction  and  specialization  involve  upgrading  within  each  sector  to  higher  value-added \nactivities through the introduction of new products and processes. These changes entail far-\nreaching transformations in many areas, such as the skill content of output. Countries that can \nsustain these multiple transitions across the different stages of their structural transformation will \ngrow successfully. This technical assistance (TA)1 will analyze Pakistan\u2019s growth prospects for \nthe next decade from the point of view of this kind of structural transformation. \n \n3.  Except for economies well-endowed with natural resources, prosperity is the result of \ncumulative economic change. Ultimately, structural transformation is about the transformation of \nthe  economy  with  a  view  to  (i)  transferring  resources  to  higher  value-added  sectors,  (ii) \ndiversifying production while upgrading it, and (iii) producing and exporting a more sophisticated \nrange  of  products.  This  entails:  (i)  identifying  the  products  that  the  country  can  produce \nprofitably by using its capabilities, (ii) using new inputs and methods of production, and (iii) \nexploring new activities and developing new capabilities. The key to structural transformation is \nindustrialization, a process that requires purposeful action. \n \n4.  A Fact-Finding Mission was undertaken in August 2007. As part of this mission, a \nbackground paper on structural transformation in Pakistan was written and presented to the \nPakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), Government\u2019s Planning Commission, and \nthe Planning and Development Board of the Punjab provincial government. Discussions were \nalso held with the special secretary of finance, and the deputy secretary of the Ministry of \nEconomic Affairs and Statistics. These presentations strengthened the rationale underlying the \nTA, and alerted policy makers in Pakistan to the relevance of the subject.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Although Pakistan has outpaced many other countries in the world economically, its \ngrowth falls short of the rates achieved by East and Southeast Asian nations in the last 30 \nyears\u2014and lags growth in the PRC and Viet Nam more recently. During the last four decades, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 November 2007. \n ", "2   \nPakistan has grown on average slightly more than 5% a year, including frequent boom and bust \nepisodes (Figure 1). Since the mid-1960s, Pakistan has had fewer\u2014and comparatively less \nintense\u2014periods  of  rapid  growth  than  PRC  and  such  newly  industrialized  countries  as \nIndonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam have \nhad almost as many bouts of rapid growth as Pakistan\u2014in only about half the time. 2 \n \nFigure 1: Pakistan's Long-Term Growth Rate\n10.0\nActual\n9.0\nTrend\n8.0\n7.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007\n \nSource: Author\u2019s calculations based on data from Handbook of Statistics on Pakistan Economy \nprepared by State Bank of Pakistan and latest Economic Survey 2006\u201307 of the Government of \nPakistan\u2019s Ministry of Finance. The trend growth was estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter \nwith a smoothing parameter of 50. \n \n \n6.  However, since the FY2001, when it was slightly below 2.0%, Pakistan\u2019s growth has \naccelerated. In FY2005, its growth rate reached 9.0%, followed by 6.6% in FY2006 and 7.0% in \nFY2007. The average growth rate in 2002\u20132007 was 6.3%. Further, growth has been trending \nup recently\u2014since the 1960s, 3 of the 9 years in which growth was 7.0% or more were in 2004, \n2005, and 2007 (Figure 1). Some evidence suggests structural change as well. Historically, \nprivate consumption has driven growth in the country, but in fiscal year July 2006 to June 2007 \ninvestment was the largest contributor to the increase in output. A key question among policy \nmakers now is whether Pakistan will be able to sustain these improvements.  \n \n7.  Pakistan\u2019s transformation during the last three decades has not been as fast and as \nintense as that of the successful Asian economies. A recent analysis of Pakistan\u2019s structural \ntransformation during this period (footnote 1) included these main findings:  \n \n(i)  The output growth rates of industry and services are significantly higher than that \nof agriculture. Given the service sector\u2019s high share in output, services account \nfor more than 50% of the total output growth rate. The contributions of agriculture \nand industry are significantly smaller. The service sector also accounts for the \nlargest share of total labor productivity growth.  \n(ii)  Pakistan is a service economy from the point of view of its output structure, but \nan agricultural economy from the point of view of employment.  \n(iii)  Labor productivity growth within economic sectors has contributed substantially \nmore  to  overall  labor  productivity  growth  than  reallocation  of  labor  from \n                                                 \n2  Felipe, Jesus. 2007. Competitiveness and Structural Transformation in Pakistan. Manila (manuscript). \n ", "  3\nagriculture into the other two sectors. Such reallocation plays a minor role \noverall. Reallocation of labor from agriculture into services has been much \nmore important than that from agriculture into industry.  \n(iv)  Labor absorption in Pakistan has declined because the absorption capacity of \nthe  service  sector  is  insufficient  to  compensate  for  the  falling  capacity  of \nagriculture, and the stagnation of industry. \n(v)  Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing share is not low, given its income per capita, trade ratio \nin gross domestic product (GDP), and population. However, the share of this \nsector in total output has been stagnant since the 1970s. This contrasts with \nwhat has occurred in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, for example, where this \nsector\u2019s shares increased.  \n(vi)  The manufacturing sector is heavily concentrated in food and beverages, and in \ntextiles. Together, they account for close to half of the sector\u2019s value-added. \n(vii)  The  level  of  technology  in  Pakistan\u2019s  manufacturing  sector  is  relatively  low, \ncompared with those in other Asian countries. Moreover, the share of high-\ntechnology products within manufacturing value-added is also low, and has been \nstagnant for 40 years. \n(viii)  Pakistan\u2019s level of labor productivity has increased very slowly since the 1970s, \nleaving plenty of room for it to catch up with the developed world. \n(ix)  The  share  of  the  top  10  exports  in  Pakistan\u2019s  export  total  has  dropped \nsignificantly  in  the  last  two  decades.  Nevertheless,  the  share  of  textiles  still \ndominates the top ten exports. The weighted average of the per capita GDPs of \nthe countries that also export Pakistan\u2019s top 10 exports has declined significantly. \nThis indicates that Pakistan is stuck in exports that are also being produced by \ncountries that are becoming relatively poorer. In addition, the income level of \nPakistan\u2019s  exports,  a  proxy  for  the  country\u2019s  export  complexity  and \ncompetitiveness, has not increased in two decades. \n \n8.  If Pakistan is to maintain, and even increase, its growth rate, it needs to accelerate its \nstructural transformation and improvements in the quality and diversification of its exports. The \nTA will produce four analytical papers that will examine the following questions:  \n \n(i)  What information is needed to assess completely where Pakistan\u2019s structural \ntransformation stands, and what are the possibilities for upgrading the country\u2019s \nproduction structure?  \n(ii)  What institutional framework and policies should Pakistan\u2019s policy makers design \nand implement to ensure the successful transformation of its economy and rapid \ngrowth, and how should this process be conceptualized and undertaken?   \n(iii)  How  are  the  sectoral  imbalances  and  reallocation  of  labor  that  structural \ntransformation entails to be managed? \n(iv)  How can Pakistan design a plan for structural transformation? \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  Pakistan\u2019s objective is to maintain or increase its current economic growth rates\u20147.5% \nover  the  past  four  years\u2014well  into  the  future.  To  help  Pakistan\u2019s  policy  makers  and \nentrepreneurs better understand the importance of structural transformation in achieving this \ngoal, and to illustrate what it will take to make current growth sustainable, the country\u2019s potential \n ", "4   \nfor structural transformation needs to be examined. The analysis will also improve the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) policy advice to the Government of Pakistan (the Government). This \nTA will (i) explain the causes of slow structural transformation of Pakistan\u2019s economy; (ii) \nprepare four analytical papers on structural transformation in Pakistan; (iii) work closely with the \nGovernment, policy makers, and entrepreneurs to guarantee that the results of this TA are \ninternalized;  (iv)  make  policy  recommendations;  and  (v)  disseminate  the  findings  through \nseminars and publications. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA consists of four components. The first paper will provide an assessment of \nPakistan\u2019s economic structure\u2014in terms of what a country produces and how it does it. This is \ncalled  the  \u201cproduct  space.\u201d  A  rapid  upward  trajectory  depends  on  a  country  moving  into \nactivities that create productivity gains; and, when these are exhausted, shifting again to newer \nactivities that are even more productive. Recent research shows that it is possible to graph or \nmap  what  a  country  produces  and  how  closely  this  basket  matches  what  other  countries \nproduce. In this way, the possibilities open to Pakistan to diversify production and increase \nproductivity can be analyzed in light of its technological and social capabilities. The analysis will \nassess Pakistan vis-\u00e0-vis other countries in Asia.  \n \n11.  A second paper will examine the quality and sophistication of Pakistan\u2019s exports. A \nstrong empirical relationship exists between a recently developed measure of a country\u2019s export \nsophistication and that country\u2019s level of income. This relationship suggests that, as countries \ndevelop, they change their export package. The measure also reflects structural transformation. \nAn in-depth and detailed analysis of Pakistan\u2019s export structure will provide key information for \nassessing the speed and direction of its transformation, and for comparisons with other Asian \ncountries. \n \n12.   The third paper is a diagnostics analysis of the impediments to structural transformation \nin Pakistan. Structural transformation does not come naturally; rather, it must be induced by \npolicy. The question is: how? Most often reform is required, either to facilitate the transfer of \nresources across sectors, to develop new activities, or to increase competition. This raises the \nnext question: which reform will deliver the most benefit? The purpose of this growth diagnostics \nexercise is to pinpoint where a little reform can go a long way. \n \n13.  The fourth paper will employ the output of the previous three to propose a plan for \nindustrial development in Pakistan, based on the belief that structural transformation is not \nautomatic but must be induced through policy. \n \n14.  The study results will be widely disseminated in Pakistan. To address concerns about \nhow  the  legal  and  policy  environment  in  Pakistan  may  affect  the  development  and \nimplementation of a realistic industrialization plan, consultants and team members will work \nclosely with the Government\u2019s Planning Commission. They will also make presentations to the \nthree main stakeholders\u2014the Government, policy makers, and entrepreneurs. Each group plays \na different and important role. The Government must demonstrate the political will to undertake \nstructural transformation, policy makers must take part in designing the plan, and entrepreneurs \nwill be responsible for carrying it out effectively. Ultimately, the success of the TA depends on \nwhether the stakeholders internalize its key ideas. The terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $370,000 equivalent.  The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $350,000 equivalent.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the TA cost through in-\nkind contributions.  Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Planning Commission will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing \nand monitoring the TA.  The study is expected to be completed in 18 months, by September \n2009. A team of international consultants will be recruited. The work will require about 36 \nperson-months of international consulting. \n  \n17.  Given the nature of the project and the expertise required, the Center for International \nDevelopment (CID) at Harvard University has been identified as the most suitable consultant. \nMuch of the TA will follow methodologies and techniques developed by CID; CID software will \nalso be used. CID, as part of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, is \na leading development institution. In the past few years, researchers at CID have developed \nnovel techniques to analyze a country\u2019s development challenges by determining its binding \nconstraints, and by graphing the country\u2019s product space. 3 CID draws upon faculty, staff, and \nresearchers  from  many  schools  and  departments  at  Harvard,  which  gives  it  a  valuable \nmultidisciplinary character. For this reason, ADB will recruit the services of CID according to the \nsingle-source selection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for Competitiveness and Structural Transformation in Pakistan, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n3  ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department has advocated the application of the growth diagnostics methodology \nof CID in country strategy formulation. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \n  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nIncrease average GDP  Sustain an average  Pakistan\u2019s national  The basic objectives \ngrowth rate  GDP growth rate of 7%  accounts  and economic policies \n  over the next decade  do not change after the \n  election of October \n2007. \n \nRisk \nIncreased political \ninstability \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nAccelerate Pakistan\u2019s  During the next  Pakistan\u2019s national  Government, policy \nrate of structural  decade:  accounts  makers, and \ntransformation, and      entrepreneurs \nimprove the  Increase share of  UNIDO data on  understand the \nsophistication of its  manufacturing output  manufacturing sector  importance of the \nexports  in GDP from about    relationship between \n  16% to about 25%    growth and structural \n  Pakistan\u2019s export data  transformation, and, \nIncrease share of    that without the latter, it \nmanufacturing    will be impossible to \nemployment in total    sustain a high growth \nemployment from  rate. \nabout 13% to about   \n18% \n \nIncrease labor \nproductivity in \nmanufacturing by an \naverage of 3% per \nannum \n \nIncrease share of \nmedium- and high- \ntechnology \nmanufacturing (non-\nelectrical machinery, \nelectrical machinery \nand transport \nequipment) in total \nmanufacturing output \nfrom about 12% to \nabout 20% \n \nIncrease CID\u2019s index of \nexport sophistication \nby at least 1,000 points \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n \n    Data   \n  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutputs      Risk \nPakistan\u2019s boom-bust  Pakistan\u2019s annual GDP  Pakistan\u2019s national  Natural disasters, bad \ngrowth cycles  growth rate remains  accounts, for the  weather affecting \ndisappear.  between trend and  growth rate of GDP;  agricultural \n  plus- and minus-one  Hodrick-Prescott filter,  performance, or \n  standard deviation of  for the trend growth  political instability may \n  the trend.  rate  lead to lower GDP \n      growth. \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.

The technical assistance (TA) project, Competitiveness and Structural Transformation in \nPakistan, will study the type of economic transformation that Pakistan\u2019s economy requires to \nsustain high growth. Pakistan\u2019s transformation during the last three decades has not been as \nfast or as intense as that of the successful Asian economies. If Pakistan is to step up and \nmaintain its growth rate, it needs to accelerate its structural transformation and improvements in \nthe quality and diversification of its exports. The TA will require about 36 person-months of \ninternational consulting. \n \n2.  The  Center  for  International  Development  (CID),  John  F.  Kennedy  School  of \nGovernment, Harvard University, will prepare four papers on Competitiveness and Structural \nTransformation in Pakistan in close consultation with the Central and West Asia Department \n(CWRD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). All four papers will be produced by a team of \neconomists with expertise in growth and development issues, and knowledge of the Pakistan \neconomy.  \n \n3.  The  first  paper  will  map  Pakistan\u2019s  product  space  following  the  methodology  in \nHausmann and Klinger and Hidalgo et al. (Appendix 4, A).1 Economic structure\u2014in terms of \nwhat a country produces, how it produces it, and what it exports\u2014matters for the country\u2019s \ngrowth. Whether a country sustains an upward trajectory or grows slowly depends on whether it \nmoves  into  activities  that  create  opportunities  for  productivity  gains;  and,  when  these  are \nexhausted, whether the country can shift once more to other new, more productive activities. \nUsing a new methodology and software developed by CID, it is possible to map what a country \nproduces  and  how  close\u2014or  far\u2014the  representation  of  this  basket  is  from  those  of  other \ncountries.  In  this  way,  the  possibilities  for  Pakistan  to  diversify  production  and  increase \nproductivity can be analyzed in light of its technological and social capabilities. The analysis will \nassess Pakistan vis-\u00e0-vis other countries in Asia. The paper will be submitted to the ADB officer \nin charge of the project by September 2008. \n \n4.  The second paper is on export quality, following the methodology in Hausmann et al. \n(Appendix 4, B). 2 A strong empirical relationship exists between the level of income of a country \nand a measure of export sophistication recently developed by CID. One implication of this \nrelationship is that, as the process of development takes place, countries change their export \npackage.  This is also a reflection of structural transformation. Therefore, an in-depth analysis, \nat a highly disaggregated level, of Pakistan\u2019s export structure will provide key information for \nassessing the speed and direction of the country\u2019s transformation. The analysis will assess \nPakistan vis-\u00e0-vis other countries in Asia. The paper will be submitted to the ADB officer in \ncharge of the project by September 2008. \n \n5.   The third paper is a growth diagnostics analysis aimed at assessing the impediments to \nstructural transformation in Pakistan. This paper will follow the methodology in Hausmann et al. \n                                                 \n1 Hausmann, Ricardo, and Bailey Klinger. 2006.

Using the analysis of the first three papers, the fourth paper will propose a plan for \nindustrial development, because structural transformation is the result of purposeful action. It is \nnot automatic, in other words, but must be induced through policy (Appendix 4, D). A well-\ndeveloped plan, in the form of industrial policy that involves strategic collaboration between \npublic and private sectors, is an important tool. Industrial policy is not about picking the winners. \nIdentification of the product space, along the lines of the new literature, is the way to identify \nsectors with potential for a country\u2019s development. The idea is based on the concept that a \ncountry has given capabilities that allow it to produce certain products. These capabilities should \nalso allow it to produce other similar goods, because they require similar capabilities. Jumping \nsuccessfully from the production of less sophisticated products\u2014textiles, for example\u2014into the \nproduction of more sophisticated ones\u2014electronics and automobiles\u2014is not simply a matter of \ntraining more engineers and scientists. As the successful Asian countries have shown, an \neconomy must master each step along the way. If this is not done, the effort at industrial \nupgrading will be an exercise in futility. The draft of the paper will be submitted to the ADB \nofficer in charge of the project by June 2009. The final version will be submitted by September \n2009. \n \n7.  In  conjunction  with  the  ADB  officer  responsible  for  the  project,  the  consultant  will \nparticipate in the dissemination of the study\u2019s results in Pakistan and in ADB headquarters in \nManila. To address concerns about how the legal and policy environment in Pakistan might \naffect the development and implementation of a realistic industrialization plan, the TA envisions \ndifferent presentations tailored to the three main stakeholders\u2014the Government, policy makers, \nand  entrepreneurs.  Each  plays  a  different  and  important  role.  The  Government  must \ndemonstrate the political will to undertake structural transformation, policy makers must take \npart in designing the plan and internalize it, and entrepreneurs will be responsible for carrying it \nout effectively. CID will also present the findings of the TA in Manila at the conclusion of the \nproject. Travel to Pakistan and to ADB\u2019s headquarters in Manila will be coordinated and agreed \nupon with ADB\u2019s officer in charge of the project. \n \nA.

The  final  report  will  consists  of  four  parts.  This  appendix  details  the  analysis  to  be \nundertaken in each of the four parts. \n \nA.  Pakistan\u2019s Product Space \n \n2.  Developing new activities and products is not easy for most developing countries. Lack of \nmarkets and coordination problems can create insurmountable difficulties. For this reason, new \nactivities are rarely created in a vacuum, as their development has to take place in the context of \nthe existing capabilities, which are useful to the extent that they are similar to those of the new \nproducts and activities. However, the degree of similarity of capabilities might vary between any \npair of activities. For example, a country that has developed capability, infrastructure, regulatory \nframework, trained labor force, and knowledge in the production of garments might be in a position \nto develop a shoe industry. However, these capabilities are unlikely to be very useful in developing \na new steel industry. Capabilities are specific to each activity.  \n \n3.  For this reason, one can think of products as trees in the forest\u2014i.e., the product space\u2014\nand being at some distance from each other in terms of capabilities. Firms are monkeys that live on \ntrees. The distance between the trees reflects the similarity of the required capabilities. In general, \nit is easier for new activities to develop close to the areas where monkeys already live, since they \nwill require similar capabilities. Producing very different new products\u2014i.e., at larger distance\u2014\nrequires capabilities that the monkeys\u2014i.e., firms\u2014do not possess. \n \n4.  Hausmann  and  Klinger  and  Hidalgo  et  al.  have  proposed  a  measure  of  the  distance \nbetween products. 1 It is based on the fact that if similar capabilities, infrastructure, and technology, \nfor example, are needed to produce two different products, this would be revealed in the fact that \ncountries that are good at one are also good at producing the other. This idea of \u201cproximity\u201d\u2014the \nability of a country to produce a product depends on its ability to produce similar products\u2014allows \nthe authors to \u201cmap the space\u201d of products in the world.2 What are some characteristics of the \nforest, or product space? First, there is a high degree of heterogeneity, with a core and a periphery. \nSecond, some parts of the forest have trees (products) with many monkeys (firms), while other \nparts contain few. This implies that the development of comparative advantage in new products is \nstrongly affected by the distance between the products being currently produced\u2014i.e., a function of \nthe existing comparative advantage\u2014and the potential new ones. In the authors\u2019 words, \u201cmonkeys \ntend to jump short distances.\u201d The key to progressing in terms of sophistication is to position the \ncountry in a well connected part of the forest where it is easier to move to other products. \n \n5.  This research shows that the way countries develop comparative advantage is far from \nrandom. Some developing countries produce on the periphery of the product space, with few \nopportunities for diversification; others have developed capabilities that are easy to deploy in a \nwide range of products, creating a path to convergence. Progress is very slow in the area of the \nforest with few trees or firms. The probability of jumping to a new tree is strongly affected by how \nfar it is from the ones now occupied. Also, the average distance to the trees eventually occupied is \n                                                 \n1  Hausmann, Ricardo, and Bailey Klinger. 2006.

Kennedy School of Government.  \n   Available: http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=773109 \nHidalgo, C.A., B. Klinger, A-L Barabasi, and R. Hausmann. 2007. The Product Space Conditions the Development of \nNations. Science 317: 482\u2013487. \n2  Strictly speaking, the proximity between two products is the minimum of the pairwise conditional probability of a \ncountry exporting a good, given that it exports another one. \n ", "  Appendix 4  13 \nmuch smaller than the distance to a randomly chosen tree. Moreover, the position of a country in \nthe forest at a point in time is a good predictor of how quickly the country upgrades. Evidence \nindicates that this is not an easy process and that using the existing capabilities to develop new \nproducts is  not  automatic.  In  fact,  when  monkeys  jump  to  new  trees\u2014or  firms  jump  to new \nproducts\u2014they land on the lower branches of the tree. Then, they move up more easily. This \nmeans that once a firm can start developing a new activity, it is easier to tackle coordination \nfailures  and  gain  the  specific  knowledge  required.  Still,  whenever  a  firm  moves  toward  new \nproducts, it has to start producing without the required capabilities, and this can be done only at \nlower qualities. For this reason, moving within products is easier and more feasible than moving \nbetween products. \n \nB.  Exports and Structural Transformation in Pakistan \n \n6.  In conventional trade theory, countries export products that are more intensive in the factors \nin which they are relatively abundant. As countries develop, they accumulate factors of production \nat different rates, and the products that countries produce and export become more intensive in \nthese  factors.  In  this  theory,  the  pattern  of  specialization  is  uniquely  determined  by  factor \nendowments, in the sense that, independently of initial conditions, the economy converges to a \npattern of specialization that can be fully explained by the economy\u2019s factor endowments. At the \nother extreme of the theoretical spectrum, some new trade theory models treat productivity growth \nas the result of learning by doing, and assume away factor endowments as a determinant of \ncomparative advantage (e.g., Krugman).3 Here, the pattern of specialization cannot be determined \nindependently of initial conditions and history. In these circumstances, real as well as monetary \nshocks become important, as they can influence the pattern of trade specialization. Industrial policy \nalso  becomes  important  in  acquiring  new  comparative  advantage,  independently  of  factor \nendowments. \n \n7.  In  recent  work,  Hausmann  et  al.  have  argued  that  specialization  patterns  are  partly \nindeterminate, and may be shaped by idiosyncratic elements.4  They have shown that there is a \nstrong relationship between the level of income of a country and the measure of the sophistication \nof exports that the authors construct. One implication of this relationship is that countries change \ntheir export package as they develop\u2014they must undergo structural transformation. Structural \ntransformation appears to be reflected in the improvements in quality and diversification of a \ncountry\u2019s exports. This implies that the range of goods that an economy ends up producing and \nexporting changes in time. It is also important to note that for the standard theory of comparative \ncosts, the transition from the production and export of one type of goods into a different one is a \nfunction of the changing factor endowments, with no role for active policy. The range of goods in \nHausmann  et  al.\u2019s  model  is  determined,  however,  not  just  by  factor  endowments,  but  is  a \ncomplicated process that is determined by the number of entrepreneurs that can be stimulated to \nengage in \u201ccost discovery\u201d in the modern sectors of the economy. The key and primary source of \ninternational gains is international learning, leading to technical progress and increased labor \nproductivity.  However,  upgrading  and  diversification  will  not  occur  automatically;  they  require \nproactive measures. The cost of discovery is the uncertainty that an entrepreneur faces when \nproducing a good for the first time in a developing economy. Even when production uses a \nstandard technology, the institutional reality of many developing countries requires a substantial \ndegree of adaptation. Therefore, an entrepreneur will explore the underlying cost structure of the \n                                                 \n3  Krugman, Paul. 1987.

This is a process that entails considerable positive externalities for other entrepreneurs \nbecause if the investment is successful, others will follow and emulate the incumbent. In this way, \nthe private returns to the first entrepreneur are socialized. If the first entrepreneur fails, however, \nhis cost remains private. The \u201cknowledge externality\u201d implies, therefore, that investment levels in \ncost discovery are suboptimal, unless the industry or the government finds some way to internalize \nthe externality. \n \n8.  Thus,  the  mix  of  goods  that  a  country  produces  and  exports  might  have  important \nimplications for economic growth. Not all goods are alike in terms of their consequences for \neconomic performance. Specializing in some products will bring faster growth than specializing in \nothers. In other words, exports can be seen both as a tool of development and as a test of a \ncountry\u2019s success. In this framework, the authors argue, government policy has a potentially \nimportant positive role to play in shaping the production structure. The authors show that countries \nthat latch on to a set of higher-quality goods tend to perform better. \n \n9.  Hausmann and Rodrik also note that countries\u2019 capabilities are specific to each activity. 5 \nThey also point out the paradox that countries sometimes do not generate potential exports, even \nthose these products seem similar to their current export products, or are manufactured and \nexported by countries that seem to have similar endowments to theirs. For example, they note that \nPakistan exports soccer balls but not hats, while Bangladesh does the opposite. An in-depth \nunderstanding of Pakistan\u2019s export structure is fundamental to understanding its prospects for \nstructural transformation. \n \nC.  Growth Diagnostics in Pakistan \n \n10.  To pinpoint which reforms can deliver the best results and put a country on the path of \nsustained growth, Hausmann et al. advocate setting reform priorities based on the size of their \ndirect effects.6 The idea behind this strategy is that it is best to focus on the reforms whose direct \neffects are expected to be significant, because (i) the full list of requisite reforms is unknowable or \nimpractical; and (ii) figuring out the second-best interactions across markets\u2014i.e., the possibility \nthat distortions interact with each other, with the possibility that the reduction in one distortion will \nend up producing a welfare loss\u2014is a nearly impossible task. Therefore, they advise policy makers \nto go for the reforms that alleviate the most binding constraints and, hence, produce the biggest \nimpact\u2014i.e, focus on the bottlenecks directly. Hausmann et al.\u2019s methodology is based on a \ndecision tree. They argue that in a low-income country, economic activity must be constrained by \nat least one of two factors: (i) the cost of finance is too high, and/or (ii) the private return to \ninvestment  is  too  low.  They  propose  following  a  decision-tree  methodology  that  takes  the \nresearcher through different branches of the tree to determine the relevant binding constraints. \n \n11.  The  Hausmann  et  al.  methodology  is  best  applied  when  the  objective  is  to  alleviate \nconstraints to ignite or stimulate growth. This is not exactly the case in Pakistan, where the \nobjective is to sustain growth. Therefore, although important tenets of the methodology are valid\u2014 \nasking whether a zero growth rate can be increased is not different, conceptually, from asking \nwhether a positive rate can be increased\u2014the exercise will require modifications. Sustaining long-\nterm  growth  in  developing  countries  requires  policies  that  reduce  boom\u2013bust  cycles.  What \ndifferentiates successful from unsuccessful countries is the ability of the former to reduce the \n                                                 \n5  Hausmann, Ricardo, and Dani Rodrik. 2006.

Industrial Policy as a Central Part of Pakistan\u2019s Development Strategy \n \n12.  Upgrading a country\u2019s production and export structures does not happen without a well-\nthought out and crafted push. Structural transformation in the successful Asian economies did not \ncome naturally or easily. Although it is common to describe the transformation of the East Asian \neconomies as a shift from garments into electronics and automobiles, it was a much more complex, \npainstaking process that entailed (i) carefully identifying products that the country could produce \nprofitably by using the existing capabilities, (ii) learning how to use new inputs and methods of \nproduction, and (iii) exploring new activities that required new capabilities. In a world where agents \nhave  to  explore,  learn,  and  adapt  to  an  unfolding  and  unpredictable  environment,  economic \nmodernization is hardly preordained. Pakistan has achieved a technological level that allows it to \nmanufacture nuclear weapons, while Singapore lacks that particular technology. This, however, is \nno guarantee that Pakistan can undergo successful structural transformation. The capabilities and \ninstitutions needed to develop a broad-based and sophisticated manufacturing sector that employs \nmillions of workers are different from those required to be able to make nuclear weapons. While \nboth undertakings call for political will, the latter requires the mobilization and coordination of a \nmuch  wider  group  of  participants  in  society,  within  the  context  of  a  market  economy  where \nglobalization, fast technical change, competition, and the demand question of what consumers \nwant, are the rules the game. Singaporean companies understand this.  \n \n13.  The  structural  transformation  of  the  successful  Asian  economies  was  the  result  of \npurposeful action that often took the form of industrial policy programs.7 What is industrial policy? \nFar from being interpreted as an exercise in what modern parlance might call picking the winners, it \nis an exercise in coordinating different activities between the public and private sectors with a view \nto identifying market failures that impede structural transformation. It is also a process of eliciting \ninformation on significant externalities, and about the constraints that exist, and the opportunities \nthat are available. This requires strategic collaboration between public and private sectors, and the \ndevelopment of the appropriate institutions for change. It applies to agriculture and services as well \nas industry. \n \n14.  Why industrial policy? Markets alone are likely to provide too few of the incentives and the \ndemand for new activities that are necessary to transform the economy. There is little economic \ndeterminism in development\u2014countries do not follow a homogeneous, predetermined trajectory\u2014\nand that there is a substantial role for policy. For example, many projects require simultaneous \ninvestments  to  be  viable;  it  will  be  difficult  to  build  a  hotel  if  transportation  infrastructure  is \ninadequate.  The  coordination  of  investment  decisions  requires  a  signaling  device  to  transmit \ninformation  about  present  plans  and  future  conditions.  Uncertainty  arising  from  a  lack  of \ninformation  and  communication\u2014one  decision  maker  having  no  way  to  know  the  concurrent \ndecisions and plans of others\u2014complicates things. If this uncertainty is sufficiently great, it might \ninhibit investment decisions and arrest growth. \n \n                                                 \n7  Hausmann, Ricardo, and Dani Rodrik. 2006.

Many developing countries have adopted industrial policies in an attempt to accelerate \nindustrialization and economic growth. The results have been mixed, judging by the wide range of \nperformance achieved under similar policies. The effectiveness of these policies is a matter of \ncontroversy. Views differ on whether they made any difference, and if they did, whether it was \npositive or negative.8 This is the case even though observers and policy makers alike have amply \ndocumented  the  role  of  industrial  policy  in  fostering  swift  industrialization  in  East  Asia.9 An \nimportant reason for this state of affairs is a lack of consensus on the key issue of how and under \nwhat conditions industrial policy can significantly alter the rate of capital accumulation and growth.  \n \n16.  The  successful  policy  interventions  geared  toward  accelerating  the  transition  between \ndifferent patterns of specialization is the basis for Rodrik\u2019s 1994 interpretation of how the Republic \nof Korea and Taipei,China became rich.10 During these transitions, old comparative advantages \nwere eroded while new ones slowly emerged. Market incentives alone would have been unable to \nmove the economy to a faster growth path. Rodrik argued that, more than their export orientation, \nthe distinguishing features of these growth experiences was the sharp and sustained increase in \ntheir  investment  rates  in  the  early  1960s.  Through  an  array  of  government  interventions,  by \nsubsidizing  and  coordinating  investment  decisions,  government  policy  was  successful  in \nreallocating resources toward modern capital-intensive industries. With increasing returns in these \nactivities, this reallocation raised the rate of return on capital, and pushed the economy into a fast \ngrowth path. Outward orientation followed because the higher investment rates increased the \ndemand for imported capital goods. The relatively high level of skills of the labor force in both \ncountries was a condition for the success of the industrial policy. \n \n17.  One important lesson that Pakistan can learn from the successful Asian economies is how \nto develop an appropriate industrial policy program that addresses (i) how the country can develop \na culture of cooperation between the public and the private sector, and (ii) which private sector \nagents  should  be  consulted  first.  Other  questions  need  answers  as  well.  Since  structural \ntransformation  is  also  about  fostering  competition,  what  sector-specific  reforms  should  be \nconsidered? Since structural transformation entails substantial labor reallocation and imbalances \nacross  sectors,  how  are  these  changes  and  their  implications  going  to  be  managed?  What \ncomplementary inputs to the market can the public sector provide? How should public spending on \ninfrastructure  and  training  be  prioritized?  What  foreign  firms  should  be  targeted  by  agencies \npromoting foreign direct investment? Further, given Pakistan\u2019s employment problem, what role \ncould industrial policy have in improving the situation? \n \n18.  What does it take for industrial policy to succeed? It is impossible to provide a recipe, but \nthe willingness of the government to monitor the results and change its policies, as needed, \nappears to be a key ingredient. Many industrial policy successes are the outcome of programs that \nproduced poor results at first. Governments had to fine-tune their efforts in light of what they had \nlearned. A government that is too involved in the industry cannot do this effectively, because the \ncurrent beneficiaries of the failed policies would tend to block the changes. However, a government \nthat simply watches from afar, and keeps firms at arms' length, does not accumulate the evidence \nit must use to be effective. Rodrik argues that the basic elements of the institutional architecture for \nindustrial policy are (i) political leadership at the top, (ii) coordination and deliberation councils, and \n                                                 \n8  Pack, Howard, and Kamal Sagi. 2006.

These are the Government, \npolicy makers, and entrepreneurs. Each plays a key role in the design and implementation of a \nsuccessful industrial policy program. While the Government must show political commitment to \nstructural transformation, policy makers will have to design the program, and entrepreneurs will \nhave  to  implement  it.  The  key  to  a  successful  transformation  of  Pakistan\u2019s  economy  lies  in \nembedding  private  initiative  in  a  framework  of  public  action  that  encourages  restructuring, \ndiversification, and technological dynamism, beyond what market forces on their own are capable \nof generating. \n \n                                                 \n11 Rodrik proposes 10 design principles for the formulation of industrial policy: (i) incentives should be provided only to \nnew activities; (ii) benchmarks for success and failure should be clear; (iii) a sunset clause must be built in; (iv) public \nsupport must target activities, not sectors; (v) activities that are subsidized must have the clear potential of providing \nspillover and demonstration effects; (vi) authority for carrying out industrial policies must be vested in agencies with \ndemonstrated competence; (vii) implementing agencies must be monitored closely by a principal with a clear stake in \nthe outcomes, and who has political authority at the highest level; (viii) agencies carrying out promotion must maintain \nchannels of communication with the private sector; (ix) optimally, mistakes that result in \u201cpicking the losers\u201d will occur; \nand (x) promotional activities need to have the capacity to renew themselves, so that the cycle of discovery becomes \nan ongoing one.
