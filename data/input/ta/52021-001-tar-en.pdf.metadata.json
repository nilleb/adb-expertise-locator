INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the National Emergency \nManagement Agency (NEMA) of Mongolia develop the legal, policy, and institutional frameworks \nneeded to strengthen disaster risk assessments and promote disaster risk reduction (DRR) and \ndisaster risk financing and insurance (DRFI) in Mongolia. The TA will improve the capacity and \nability of NEMA, ministries, local government officials, and communities to understand and better \nplan for disaster risks and respond to disasters. The knowledge and outputs generated through \nthe TA will also provide evidence-based policy recommendations and a draft law for disaster \ninsurance as a key financial risk management tool. \n \n2.  The Government of Mongolia requested TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nsupport disaster risk management (DRM).1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2020\u20132021.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Mongolia is extremely vulnerable to natural hazards because of its geographical location, \npoorly developed infrastructure, persistent poverty, limited institutional capacity, and continental \nclimate that directly influences the nature, scale, and frequency of hazards experienced. The \ncountry experiences over 3,000 small to medium-scale disasters each year, posing serious \nsetbacks to the country\u2019s social and economic sustainable development.3 The toll of disasters has \nbeen significant: during 2004\u20132013, disasters and hazardous phenomena caused about $321 \nmillion  of damages and losses.4 Over the same period, the government spent a total of $16 million \n\u2014from  central  and  local  government  resources  and  respective  ministerial  budgets  and \ndonations\u2014for disaster response and recovery activities (footnote 4). To support Mongolia\u2019s \nsustainable socioeconomic development, there is a significant need for Mongolia to strengthen \nits DRM system. This requires a comprehensive approach to DRM, based on a more holistic \napproach, which includes DRFI, emphasizing DRR, and coupling structural and nonstructural \nactions, as well as strengthening disaster preparedness and emergency response.  \n \n4.  Current laws and policies predominantly focus on disaster preparedness and emergency \nresponse but do not adequately cover disaster risk reduction, financing, or insurance. It is important \nto strengthen DRR strategies that include identifying risks and hazards, increasing awareness about \nthe impact of those risks, planning for them, making resources (including financial) available to \nimplement plans, and integrating all these elements into the development agenda and plans. \n \n5.  The government plans to (i) increase investments in risk reduction and preparedness \nmeasures and (ii) provide opportunities to engage the private sector as a complement to further \nincrease overall financial resilience to disasters. These plans should include promoting financing \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 August 2019. \n2  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2020\u20132021. Manila. Originally listed as Disaster Risk \nAssessment and Disaster Insurance.  \n3 Natural hazards common in Mongolia include droughts, dzud (extreme winter weather conditions), dust and \nsnowstorms, whirlwinds, desertification, thunderstorms, heavy rains, floods, earthquake, and human and animal \ninfectious diseases. Artificial and technological hazards include forest and steppe fires, aircraft crashes, ice break of \nrivers and lakes, mine explosions and underground collapse, chemical hazards and toxic substances, building fires, \nand major traffic accidents.  \n4  NEMA. 2017. Strengthening the Capacity of Disaster Risk Transfer and Development of Disaster Risk Insurance \nSystem in Mongolia. Ulaanbaatar.  \n \n ", "2 \ninstruments for different layers of risk. However, there is limited understanding and knowledge \namong policy makers, private sector stakeholders, and the public about (i) enhanced financial \narrangements for disaster response, (ii) the levels and nature of disaster risk, opportunities for \nDRR, and preparedness measures, and (iii) the related benefits such actions can bring. Current \nfinancial management and risk reduction actions are not comprehensive and have limited impact. \nAn overall disaster risk financing strategy needs to be put in place. \n \n6.  Disaster risk insurance is a financial instrument that can enhance resilience. The Law on \nDisaster Protection of Mongolia, which was revised and ratified in 2017, provides the legal basis \nfor disaster risk insurance as part of the risk transfer approach.5 The law requires all legal entities \nto have an insurance policy in place against the potential risk of natural and artificial disaster \nincidents. However, the law does not provide details on the regulatory framework. The absence \nof such a framework has limited the upscaling of initiatives made by development partners in \nadvancing the insurance mechanism on disaster risk, like the index-based livestock insurance \nprogram and plans by private local insurers to offer earthquake risk insurance products. \n \n7.  Strengthening the legal, policy, and institutional frameworks required for a comprehensive \napproach to manage disaster risk will enhance Mongolia\u2019s resilience and national capacity to cope \nwith disasters. As the basis for such a system, strengthening the disaster risk assessment \nprocess,  including  modeling,  will  improve  the  identification  of  hazards,  assessment  of  risk \nexposure and vulnerability, and estimates about the frequency and severity of potential damage \nand losses. This increased knowledge and awareness about the hazards and risks will allow the \ngovernment and communities to better plan to reduce disaster risk and identify preparedness \nneeds and priorities. A disaster risk financing strategy can help implement these DRR plans \nthrough appropriate financing instruments and related budgetary support for disaster relief, early \nrecovery, and reconstruction. Strengthening financial risk transfer instruments will be crucial to \nensure that the government can deliver the benefits of such tools. To support these improved \nactions, the government and stakeholders will need improved capacity and awareness at the \nnational and local levels to increase uptake of the preparedness and financing tools. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Mongolia\u2019s resilience to and national capacity to \ncope with disasters enhanced (Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030).6 The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: DRM mechanisms and governance at the national and local levels strengthened.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Disaster risk assessments enhanced. It is important to identify the broad \nrange of natural and artificial hazardous events and to assess those that could cause significant \ndamage  and  disruption.  This  output  will  focus  on  improving  the  process  for  disaster  risk \nassessments and the resulting assessment outputs. The disaster risk assessment process may \nuse a disaster risk modeling approach to identify hazards, assess risk exposure and vulnerability, \nand estimate the frequency and severity of potential damage and losses. The approach should \nbe (i) holistic to uncover complex risks arising from vulnerabilities and interdependencies across \n                                                \n5  The initial law on disaster protection of Mongolia was approved in 2003.  \n6  State Great Khural of Mongolia. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030. Ulaanbaatar. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "  3 \nsectors and (ii) a continual process which benefits from being documented, monitored, and \nregularly reevaluated over time.  \n \n10.  This  output  will  (i)  assess  the  current  procedures  for  risk  assessment  and  propose \nrecommendations  to  improve  the  process;  (ii)  provide  recommendations  to  improve  the \nmethodology and approach, which may include modeling, for carrying out disaster risk assessments, \nincluding  the  institutional  and  regulatory  frameworks,  data  requirements,  and  enhanced \nassessment information dissemination channels; (iii)  prepare guidelines for a comprehensive \ndisaster risk assessment process; and (iv) test the proposed improved methodology and risk model \nwith multi-hazard disaster risk assessments conducted at national and local levels. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Disaster  risk  reduction  planning  enhanced.  This  output  will  use  the \nassessments from output 1 to help decision makers understand the scale and nature of disaster \nrisks, including financial burden, and to develop improved DRR plans. This output will address \nnational and local levels to ensure an integrated and comprehensive approach to DRR from \nministry, local government community levels. This output will:  \n(i)   review  and  propose  an  improved  process  for  DRR  planning\u2014including  the \ninstitutional and organizational setup of the national and local levels, roles and \nresponsibilities, financial plans, and commitments\u2014and identify constraints and \nchallenges and provide recommendations to fill existing gaps;  \n(ii)   prepare guidelines to mainstream DRR planning, including the use of multi-hazard \ndisaster risk assessments (from output 1), and incorporate post-disaster impact \nassessment results at the national and local government levels, including aimag \n(province), soum (district), and bagh (subdistrict);  \n(iii)   demonstrate use of multi-hazard disaster risk assessments by supporting selected \nproject sites (up to five aimags) to apply improved DRR planning;8  \n(iv)   undertake a capacity needs assessment and propose capacity building (training and \nawareness raising) program to enhance DRR planning at the national and local levels; and  \n(v)   provide recommendations for using high-level technology that could promote DRR \nplanning  efficiencies  and  expand  application  to  enable  better  understanding, \nprediction, and planning of disaster risks to improve local level resilience.  \n \n12.    Output 3: Financial resilience policies and best practices recommended. Disasters \ncan have severe impacts which can cripple development agendas and targets; therefore, it is \nimportant to (i) ensure that the economy has the necessary financial resources to recover and \nrebuild and (ii) take efforts to reduce potential loss levels. Effective DRM includes strengthening \nfinancial resilience through various DRFI instruments for relief, early recovery, and reconstruction, \nincluding both risk retention and risk transfer solutions, with instruments available to individual \nhouseholds, herders, and businesses, as well as to the government. This strengthened financial \nresilience can help clarify allocation of disaster costs (government contingent liability and private \nsector) and help align incentives with a shared vision of how risks are to be retained, reduced, \nand transferred within the economy, thus promoting a culture of risk management within the \nsociety. This output will review options and propose best practices for DRFI instruments that can \nbe applied to various layers of risk to reduce the impact of disasters.  \n \n                                                \n8  Five aimags (including soum and communities therein) will be selected to demonstrate DRR planning activities. \nSelection criteria may include: (i) occurrence of significant disaster hazard events; (ii) local emergency management \nagency staff in place at aimag level and assigned officer at soum level, who are supportive of implementing DRM \nactivities; (iii) interest and commitment of local community in participating in DRM activities; (iv) social and economic \nprofile, including poverty rate and opportunities for social protection, inclusiveness, and gender mainstreaming. \n ", "4 \n13.  The output\u2019s key tasks include: (i) analyzing current and past practices, experiences, \ninstitutional arrangements, regulatory and policy aspects, the availability and suitability of DRFI \ninstruments, current investment plans, and actual spending on DRR, preparedness, and response; \n(ii) reviewing the insurance sector\u2014assessing current government and private sector disaster risk \ninsurance markets, risk strategies (reinsurance and retention of insurance), insurance products \navailable,  use  of  subsidies  (if  any),  regulatory  and  policy  aspects,  and  institutional  and \norganizational  arrangements  and  capacity\u2014and  proposing  recommendations  to  improve \narrangements; (iii) proposing a disaster risk finance strategy and action plan, including a financing \nplan for DRR; (iv) providing recommendations to promote disaster risk insurance through improved \ninstitutional  and  organizational  arrangements  and  capacity,  policy  recommendations,  required \nrevisions to existing legislation, and a financial plan for disaster insurance; (v) preparing the draft \ndisaster risk insurance law based on multi-stakeholder consultation; and (vi) preparing policy \nbriefs, rationale, and supporting documents for the proposed disaster insurance law legal and \nregulatory  framework,  which  can  be  used  as  resources  for  policy  makers,  NEMA,  and \nstakeholders to raise awareness about the need for improved legislation.  \n \n14.    The key deliverables from this output will be (i) the draft disaster insurance law and \nrecommendations for institutional and regulatory strengthening and awareness raising about the \nbenefits of disaster insurance and regulatory requirements and (ii) the disaster risk finance \nstrategy with DRR financing plan. \n \n15.    Output  4:  Institutional, technical  and  management  capacity  strengthened. This \noutput will provide capacity building and training to raise awareness and understanding about (i) \nthe improved methodologies and approaches proposed from this TA and (ii) how the public and \nprivate sector can address risk, including opportunities for developing public\u2013private partnerships \nto integrate an approach to disaster risk reduction, financing, and insurance. This component will \nalso conduct policy consultations and awareness raising activities for government officials and \nparliamentarians to promote understanding and uptake of proposed revisions to regulatory and \nlegal frameworks required to support improved DRR and DRFI implementation. \n \n16.  Key tasks to be undertaken by this output include: (i) an in-depth baseline assessment of \nrelevant  existing  DRM  and  DRFI  legislation,  policies,  and  frameworks,  and  development  of \nrecommendations to fill gaps in and improve existing legislation, policies, and frameworks, including \nnew legislation as required; (ii)  strengthening the role of national and local councils for DRR and \nDRFI, in part to facilitate multi-sector consultation; (iii) assessment of opportunities to engage the \nprivate sector, focusing on proposing opportunities for public\u2013private partnerships for DRM and \nDRFI, which may include public\u2013private dialogues, business recommendations on regulations \nand law, and local initiatives to support private sector engagement in DRM; (iv) undertaking \nawareness raising and advocacy activities with stakeholders (national and local level government, \nprivate sector, and communities) and promoting a comprehensive approach to DRM, including \nthe role  and  importance  of  disaster  risk  assessments  and modeling,  DRR  planning,  DRFI \ninstruments and strategy, and the benefits and role of disaster-related insurance and insurance \nproducts; (v) undertaking capacity building activities with ministries and line agencies to strengthen \nDRM awareness and enhance roles and responsibilities for mainstreaming DRR and DRFI into \nsector  policies  and  strategies;  (vi)  holding  workshops  and  awareness  raising  forums  with \nstakeholders,  including  parliamentarians,  to  raise  awareness  about  DRM,  DRR,  and  DRFI \napproaches, as required; and (vii) preparing a tool kit to help mainstream DRR and DRFI into \ndevelopment policies, including linking to and monitoring the sustainable development goals. \n \n17.  Lessons learned. The TA will include lessons from ongoing DRM projects that pilot DRR \napproaches, including bottom-up institutionalized approaches to involve communities in DRM to \n ", "  5 \nsafeguard livelihoods and build local level resilience.9 Other lessons included are the need to (i) \nengage with key stakeholders working in the DRM sector in Mongolia to ensure collaboration and \nenhance complementarity of activities and (ii) promote strong involvement of senior government \nofficials and concerned government agencies to ensure quality outputs that, through strategically-\nplanned dissemination activities, can help showcase the findings and policy recommendations for \nfaster uptake. Equally important is the need to mainstream activities with relevant government \nministries  and  agencies  to  ensure  the  embedding,  continuation,  institutional  support,  and \nsustainability of TA activities. \n \n18.  Strategic fit. The TA will help NEMA strengthen its capacity for DRM. This is consistent \nwith  the  Mongolia  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030,  which  aims  to  establish  national \ncapacity to cope with climate change and strengthen the system to reduce disaster risks.10 The \nTA design follows ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority for tackling climate change, building \nclimate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability, and operational plans: \nthe Climate Change Operational Framework, 2017\u20132030 and the Operational Plan for Integrated \nDisaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020.11 The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020, supporting policy reforms, capacity building, and knowledge \nsharing.12 ADB adds value by promoting a comprehensive DRM framework that emphasizes \ndisaster risk finance and reduction and strengthens disaster preparedness and response. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n20.  The following are ineligible items under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction: (i) purchase \nof vehicles, (ii) salaries for civil servants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) \ndetailed engineering design, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s \nList of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.13  \n \n21.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and travel \nexpenses of counterpart staff; domestic transportation; available relevant government data and \nstudies for the TA consultants\u2019 use; office accommodation, including use of meeting rooms, office \nfacilities and supplies, and geographical information system maps; administrative assistance; and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.
