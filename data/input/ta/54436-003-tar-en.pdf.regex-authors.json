THE WOMEN\u2019S FINANCING MARKETPLACE \n \n1.  The REG: Technical Assistance for the Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace, approved in \nNovember 2020, will facilitate and broaden access to finance for women and women businesses \nand communicate ADB\u2019s efforts in this area to encourage more lending to this sector.1 Many \nfinancial institutions (FIs) in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) have not targeted \nwomen borrowers and do not recognize the untapped commercial potential.2  Moreover, there is \na lack of awareness of the barriers women or women businesses encounter when trying to access \nfinancial  services.  Therefore,  there  is  an  absence  of  targeted  marketing  and  suitable  and \naffordable products for women. The impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nhave reinforced the importance of a digital economy to change business models into digital \nbusiness  models  and  to  integrate  digital  channels  into  how  financial  service  providers  or \nbusinesses engage with customers. \n \n2.  During this period and post-COVID-19 under the \u201cnew normal\u201d environment, a dedicated \nonline platform can help support FIs and their existing and potential women borrowers. The \nWomen\u2019s Financing Marketplace (the Marketplace) is an innovative approach using a digital \nplatform to interact with and engage through social media channels to build a subscriber base \nand follower list that will be used to facilitate an online community through linkages and resources \non content relevant for the FIs and their female borrowers. The Marketplace will: (i) aggregate \nand disseminate products on gender financing in the financial sector within ADB and to the \nbroader external audience; (ii) support the identification of cutting-edge technologies for FIs to \nachieve operational efficiencies, develop and scale new products to digitize business models, \nsuch as the use of alternative credit scoring models, mobile technology, cloud technology, and \nonline delivery channels; (iii) build capacity for FIs to promote gender responsive financial service \ndelivery and women businesses to improve viability through a range of digital toolkits, webinars \nand online support; (iv) establish linkages to other programs and initiatives on enabling access to \nfinance for women, internal and external to ADB3; and (v) create a community platform to attract \nother  co-financiers,  including  potential  technical  assistance  (TA)  funding  providers.  The \nidentification of innovative technologies for service delivery models will be supported through this \nTA, Subproject 2. \n \n3.  The TA cluster is envisaged to have 4 Subprojects: (i) Design, Set up and Maintenance of \nthe Marketplace, (ii) Innovation and Technologies, (iii) Capacity Building, and (iv) Expansion of \nthe Marketplace. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n4.  This is the second subproject under the REG: Technical Assistance for the Women\u2019s \nFinancing Marketplace. The first subproject was approved in November 2020 and consultants are \nbeing recruited. \n \n \n1  Women business in this context means micro-, small- and medium-sized women-owned or women-managed \nbusinesses. \n2  Financial institutions in this context are banks and non-bank financial institutions including microfinance institutions, \nhousing finance, and insurance companies, for instance. \n3  For example, PSFI\u2019s Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program or ADB Ventures and SDCC\u2019s Gender \nand Development initiatives or Tech for Impact. \n ", "2 \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n \n5.  The TA cluster has the following overall outcome: sustainable financial inclusion for \nwomen and women businesses increased. Subproject 2 will specifically contribute by supporting \nthe identification and design of innovative technologies and suitable and sustainable digital \nservice delivery models to support gender-responsive ecosystems. \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities  \n \n6.  Output 1: Innovative technologies designed to support digital gender-responsive \necosystems.  Many FIs and women\u2019s businesses in ADB\u2019s DMCs have not yet digitized their \nservice delivery models. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to face the challenge \nof digital transformation and ADB will seek to support FIs and women businesses in addressing \nthis opportunity.4 FIs will be identified and selected based on specific criteria, among others their \nneed for digitization of business processes, their focus on  increasing finance to women\u2019s \nbusinesses, and their management\u2019s buy-in for the digital transformation. In the first phase, one \nsuch activity, as provided under this subproject, will be to conduct a market scoping and needs \nassessment for innovative financial technologies relevant for FIs that intend to increase their \ngender-responsive finance portfolio. These would be specific technologies that facilitate greater \naccess to finance for women or women\u2019s businesses. This can be done in cooperation with one \nFI or several FIs in a specific country or region or on a stand-alone basis. Based on the \nassessment, an FI can be supported through ADB\u2019s technology platform to identify suitable \ncutting-edge digital solutions for \u201clast mile\u201d service delivery targeted to women\u2019s businesses with \nthe potential to pilot such solutions.5 This would, for example, address issues such as a lack of \ninfrastructure and connectivity, challenges of remote locations, efficiency and cost factors and \ngender disparities. The first FI to be supported will be in Papua New Guinea (PNG) as the \ncofinancing is earmarked for PNG. In PNG, this component can then also build on ADB\u2019s \nsovereign sector experience of supporting the Bank of PNG in the creation of a national digital ID, \nADB\u2019s partnership with a local FI, and its sovereign programs targeting the development of small \nand medium-sized enterprises, with a specific focus on women.  \n \n7.  In addition, support can also be provided directly to an FI through IT assessments as well \nas capacity building for specific gender lens financing topics and digital solutions such as, for \nexample, alternative credit scoring models which incorporate gender specific data.6 This could be \nin the form of digitizing credit scoring models or integrating gender-specific data in the algorithms. \nMonitoring of the FI and evaluating the results from this work will also be a necessary part of the \nprocess to assess the impact of these initiatives. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n8.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $400,000, of which all will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (WeFi) under the Women Accelerating \n \n4  First, focus will be on supporting FIs which are already ADB clients or potential new clients and have contacted ADB \nfor support. The next phase will cover individual women\u2019s businesses as well. \n5  This will be done in cooperation with ADB\u2019s Information Technology Department. See challenges.adb.org or \ndigital.adb.org. \n6  In cooperation with the FI, it can be decided whether ADB\u2019s support comes in the form of consulting services, support \nthrough hackathon or sandbox programs or contribution to the FI\u2019s own assessment, preparation, and implementation \nof new technologies. Cost matching from the FI will be sought as much as possible. ", "3 \nVibrant Enterprises in Southeast Asia and the Pacific (WAVES) program.7 The funds will support, \namong  others,  the  identification  of  cutting-edge  technology  solutions  for  digital,  gender- \nresponsive financial service delivery in a safe environment with a potential to commercially pilot \nsuch solutions. It will cover IT infrastructure (as necessary), remuneration, travel, and per diem \nfor international/national consultants and miscellaneous expenses. ADB will seek cost-matching \nfrom its client as much as possible. \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n9.  ADB will administer Subproject 2 and its Private Sector Operations Department, Financial \nInstitutions Division, will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants in collaboration with the \nTransaction Support Division and Information Technology Department, as necessary.  \n \nTable 1: Subproject 2 Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  2021-2023  \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing  PSOD, PSFI \nagencies \nKey Consultant  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n(others to be identified  Technology Feasibility  Individual Consultant  ADB, Subproject 2 \nlater in line with  Expert (s)  Selection Method \nrequirements) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nAdvance Contracting  Advance contracting will be considered to for early recruitment purposes.  \nNo contracts will be signed with consultants until subprojects have been \napproved. \nAsset turnover or  If goods are procured by ADB, ADB may turn them over to the recipient or \ndisposal arrangement  TASU will follow the disposal procedure indicated in AO 4.02 in consultation \nupon TA completion   with OAS. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n10.
