INTRODUCTION \n1.  Natural  hazards  continue  to  cause  significant  loss  of  life  and  property  in  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs) in Southeast Asia. However, \ninvestments to strengthen disaster resilience remain a low priority. This is partly because of \nlimited  understanding  of  the  socioeconomic  ramifications  of  disasters,  as  the  damage  and \nlosses caused by historical disasters are often not fully recorded; and limited understanding of \nthe opportunities available to reduce disaster risk by integrating measures into development \ninvestments. The Sixth Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction called for \nimproved public investments in disaster risk management (DRM) by strengthening the capacity \nof  institutions  to  develop,  analyze,  and  use  risk  information  in  development  planning  and \nimplementation.1  ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020 \nhas prioritized strengthening the capacity of DMCs to mainstream DRM into development.2 The \nIntegrated  Disaster  Risk  Management  (IDRM)  Fund  has  also  prioritized  strengthening  the \ncapacity of Southeast Asian DMCs in identifying and analyzing disaster risk, and undertaking \npolicy analysis to strengthen fiscal support for DRM.3 \n \n2.  This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA), to be financed by the \nIDRM Fund, will strengthen the capacity of selected Southeast Asian DMCs\u2014Cambodia, the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, and Thailand\u2014in collecting and using \ndisaster risk information for decision making.4 Consultations were held with DMC agencies, and \ngovernment concurrence has been received for the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, the outline terms of reference for consultants and cost estimates of the TA.5 \nLetters  of  no  objection  will  be  secured  from  the  relevant  governments  prior  to  TA \nimplementation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  To  understand  the  consequences  of  disaster  events  on  society  and  the  economy, \ninformation on all disaster events must be systematically recorded and analyzed, including \ninformation on small-scale localized recurrent events that are typically not captured in global \ndisaster statistics but have a significant impact on affected communities. Such analysis can \nshed light on risk patterns, reveal possible trends over time, and provide a better understanding \nof the effectiveness of investments to strengthen resilience. Various Southeast Asian DMCs, \nwith the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), are establishing \ndisaster loss databases that enable the collection and analysis of disaster impact data.6 These \n                                                \n1  The Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction is a biennial mechanism that brings together the \nministers in charge of disaster risk management (DRM) to discuss policy issues. The sixth conference was held in \nBangkok in June 2014 and adopted the Bangkok Declaration on Disaster Risk Reduction in Asia and the Pacific. \n2  ADB. 2014. Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020. Manila. \n3  The  Integrated  Disaster  Risk  Management  Fund  was  established  by  ADB  in  2013,  with  support  from  the \nGovernment of Canada, as a resource to develop innovative regional solutions for DRM in Southeast Asian DMCs. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 September 2014. \n5  Consultation  missions  were undertaken during 6\u201317  October 2014.  The  national  DRM  focal agencies\u2014the \nNational Committee for Disaster Management in Cambodia; the Department of Disaster Management and Climate \nChange, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in the Lao PDR; the Relief and Resettlement Department, \nMinistry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement in Myanmar; and the Department of Disaster Prevention and \nMitigation, Ministry of Interior in Thailand\u2014confirmed their willingness to participate in the TA. \n6  National  disaster  loss  databases  in  participating  DMCs  include  (i)  Cambodia\u2019s  disaster  loss  and  damage \ninformation system, launched in 2014 and hosted by the National Committee for Disaster Management; (ii) the \nLao PDR  disaster  loss  database,  launched  in  2011,  with  data  requiring  transfer  to  the  newly  established \nDepartment of Disaster Management and Climate Change, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; and \n(iii) the  Myanmar  disaster  loss  and  damage  database, under  development  by  the Relief  and  Resettlement \n ", "2 \n \ndatabases  collect  information  on  lives  lost;  people  affected;  crops  lost;  and  infrastructure \ndamaged. However, gaps exist, especially in inconsistency regarding the collection of sector-\nspecific data, and poor linkages with wider data management systems of line agencies. These \nissues limit the use of disaster impact data in public investment decisions. \n \n4.  DMCs have been undertaking disaster risk assessments, which vary in terms of scale, \nattributes, and purpose. However, few of these assessments have been used to inform public \ninvestment decisions. While the quality and availability of data remains an issue, the use of \ndisaster risk information in decision making processes faces additional challenges: (i) limited \nunderstanding of the development processes that underlie and drive the generation of disaster \nrisk, (ii) lack of a policy and regulatory mandate to consider disaster risk for investment planning, \nand (iii) limited DRM capacity within line agencies. Considerable capacity building is required to \naddress these issues. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) is \nsupporting DMCs to build awareness on and capacity for risk-sensitive investment planning. \n \n5.  Further challenges exist in securing financing for and tracking DRM-related investments. \nSuch investments are often scattered across sector budgets and, in some cases, may form just \none component or even an indirect benefit of a wider development project rather than stand-\nalone projects. The extent of public investment in DRM may not be explicitly reflected in records \non the allocation of public funds, and the issue of DRM possibly not even fully considered in \nnational budgetary processes. Additional issues are related to monitoring expenditure on post-\ndisaster response, in particular reflecting significant reliance on post-disaster reallocations of \nfinancial resources, which are poorly recorded. These challenges make it difficult to (i) hold \npublic bodies to account on DRM-related policy and spending commitments, (ii) ensure that \nindividual line agencies have sufficient resources to meet their DRM-related responsibilities, \n(iii) ensure that the balance of expenditure between disaster risk reduction and post-disaster \nresponse is cost-effective, and (iv) ensure that the extent and nature of public spending on DRM \nis  rational  relative  to  the  scale  and  nature  of  disaster  risk  and  other  demands  on  public \nresources. In this context, more efforts are needed to review how DRM-related expenditures are \nintegrated  into  national  budgetary  processes  and  to  capture  this  spending.  UNDP  has \ndeveloped a methodology for tracking climate change-related public expenditure, providing a \ngood starting point from which to tackle enhanced mechanisms for DRM-related expenditure. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be improved risk-sensitive decision making for public investments in \nselected  Southeast  Asian  DMCs\u2014Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  and  Thailand.  The \noutcome will be improved capacity in selected Southeast Asian DMCs to integrate DRM in the \ndevelopment processes. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  participating  DMCs  in  using  disaster  risk \ninformation for decision making. It will have the following outputs. \n \n8.  Output 1: Disaster dataset for selected line agency or city entered in the national \ndisaster  loss  database  of  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  and \nMyanmar.

In Cambodia, the output will (i) explore incorporation of the road-related data fields \nof the Cambodia disaster loss and damage database information system into the road asset \nmanagement systems database maintained by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n(MPWT);  (ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  MPWT  and  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  in \ncollecting  and  analyzing  disaster  impact  data for  decision  making  in the  road  sector;  and \n(iii) strengthen  coordination  between  MPWT,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development,  and  the \nNational Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) on the systematic collection and use of \nroad-related disaster impact data.7 In the Lao PDR, the output will (i) incorporate road-related \ndata fields of the national disaster loss database into the road maintenance and management \nsystems database of the Department of Roads (DOR), MPWT; (ii) build the capacity of DOR, \nMPWT in collecting and analyzing disaster impact data for decision making; and (iii) strengthen \ncoordination between DOR and the Department of Disaster Management and Climate Change, \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE).8 In Myanmar, the output will be \nimplemented under the ongoing initiative to develop the Myanmar disaster loss and damage \ndatabase, led by the Relief and Resettlement Department, Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and \nResettlement; and will support specific cities in establishing their disaster loss databases.9  \n  \n9.  Output 2: Report on scope and recommendations for integration of disaster risk \ninformation  in  public  investment  planning  process  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  and  Myanmar.  The  output  will  take  stock  of existing  disaster  risk \ninformation in the country, and provide guidance on how such information can be used for the \npublic  investment  planning  process.  In  Cambodia,  the  output  will  require  working  with  the \nNCDM, Ministry of Planning, and the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology.10 In the Lao \nPDR, the output will require working with the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and the \nDepartment of Disaster Management and Climate Change.11 In Myanmar, the output will require \nworking with the Relief and Resettlement Department and the Department of Planning.12 The \noutput will also include sharing experiences among other Southeast Asian DMCs. \n \n10.  Output 3: Review and dialogue on potential reform to strengthen the institutional \narrangements for managing disaster risk management-related public expenditures for \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand. The output will build on a methodology \ndeveloped by UNDP for climate public expenditure review. In the Lao PDR, the output will \nstrengthen the capacity of officials from the Ministry of Finance, MPI, and  MONRE in tracking \n                                                \n7  The output will benefit ADB\u2019s investments in the road sector. Since the 2011 and 2013 floods, ADB has been \nsupporting the Government of Cambodia to reconstruct roads through ADB. 2012.

The output will also include \nsharing experiences through a regional workshop with other Southeast Asian DMCs. \n \n11.  Output  4:  Regional  knowledge  sharing  on  enhanced  use  of  disaster  risk \ninformation for decision making in Southeast Asia. This output will focus on disseminating \nthe TA outputs in other Southeast Asian DMCs through a regional knowledge-sharing event and \nwithin ADB. The output will include (i) a regional knowledge workshop; and (ii) country-specific \nDRM briefs for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Myanmar. The briefs will use the information \ncollected  in  outputs  1, 2,  and  3  as the  starting  point;  and  will  provide  a  snapshot  of  the \ninstitutional, legislative, and disaster-risk profile of the country, in a format that is useful to guide \nstrengthening  resilience  in  ADB\u2019s  operations.  This  output  is  also  in  accordance  with  the \nrecommendation of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for IDRM supporting the development of regional \npublic goods and services on DRM. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nIDRM Fund15 and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2015 to December 2016. \nADB  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  Climate  Change  Coordination  and  Disaster  Risk \nManagement Unit in ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) will be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  TA  activities,  including  the  implementation  of  output  4,  in \ncollaboration with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department (SERD), Urban Community of Practice \nand  Governance  and  Public  Management  Community  of  Practice.  RSDD  by  facilitating \npartnership with UNDP and UNISDR will leverage on the global DRM tools developed by these \norganizations and will support SERD in integrating such tools in operations.  RSDD will facilitate \nsharing of lessons learned under the TA with DMCs from other regions.  \n \n14.  For outputs 1 and 3, ADB will engage UNDP as the implementing agency through an \nadministrative arrangement.16 UNDP is supporting Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Myanmar in \nestablishing disaster loss databases. Output 1 will provide additional support to this ongoing \nprocess,  focusing  on  sectors  or  cities  where  ADB  has  pipeline  investments.  UNDP  has \ndeveloped a detailed methodology for reviewing climate change-related public expenditure and \napplied it in selected Southeast Asia DMCs.17 By engaging UNDP for the implementation of \n                                                \n13 The output will be implemented under UNDP\u2019s Integrated Disaster and Climate Risk Management Project in the \nLao PDR, and will explore linkages with the upcoming public expenditure review process in 2015 to be led by the \nWorld Bank.  \n14 The output will be implemented under UNDP\u2019s Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk \nReduction in Development Planning Project in Thailand. \n15 Financing partner: the Government of Canada. \n16 ADB  and  UNDP  have  a  memorandum  of  understanding  for  administrative  arrangements.  The  original \nmemorandum of understanding between ADB and UNDP was signed in 2007 and amended in June 2014. \n17 Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n ", "  5\noutput 3, the TA will benefit from the expertise available within UNDP and from its  proven \nmethodology. UNDP will involve UNISDR and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) Secretariat in all major activities under outputs 1 and 3, and will ensure that the \noutputs are aligned with the implementation of relevant flagship projects under phase 2 of the \nASEAN  Agreement  on  Disaster  Management  and  Emergency  Response  (AADMER)  Work \nProgram.18 \n \n15.  For output 2, ADB will engage UNISDR as the implementing agency, using single source \nselection through ADB\u2019s Consultant Management System.19 By partnering with UNISDR, the TA \nwill benefit from the expertise available within UNISDR, and the relationship it has with national \nDRM focal agencies. UNISDR is implementing a global program on Building Capacities for \nIncreased  Public  Investment  in  Integrated  Climate  Change  Adaptation  and  Disaster  Risk \nReduction, and output 2 will benefit from this program. UNISDR will involve UNDP and the \nASEAN Secretariat in all activities under output 2, and ensure the outputs are aligned with the \nimplementation of priorities under phase 2 of the AADMER work program. For outputs 1, 2, and \n3, lump-sum payments and/or output-based contract will be considered for UNDP and UNISDR. \n \n16.  A  TA  working  group  will  be  formed,  comprising  experts  from  UNDP,  UNISDR,  the \nASEAN Secretariat, and SERD and RSDD from ADB. The role of the working group will be to (i) \nprovide technical guidance on implementing the outputs and ensure its linkage with SERD\u2019s \noperations, (ii) ensure synergy with other similar projects in the participating DMC, and (iii) \nmonitor implementation of the activities in accordance with the TA schedule. The partnership \nbetween UNDP, UNISDR, and ADB will help bring stakeholders in the countries\u2014the national \nDRM focal agency, selected line agency, and national planning and finance agencies\u2014together, \nas  their  roles  are  crucial  for  the  success  of  the  TA  outputs.
