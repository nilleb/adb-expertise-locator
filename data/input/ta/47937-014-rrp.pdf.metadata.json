I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $50 million to be provided by the ADB Clean Technology Fund1 \nto Supreme Energy Rantau Dedap for the Rantau Dedap Geothermal Development Project \n(Phase 1) in Indonesia. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Identifying a clean energy path. A more secure and sustainable future for Indonesia is \ncontingent on increased access to clean energy. The country demonstrated strong economic \nperformance  throughout  the  global  recession,  with  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth \naveraging 6% during 2009\u20132012.2 If this growth continues, demand for electricity is projected to \nrise by more than 8% per annum until 2029. Since Indonesia currently uses coal and oil to \nproduce 65% of its electricity and fuel its economic growth, a failure to diversify into cleaner \nenergy sources for power generation will magnify the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, constrain \nits ability to meet rising electricity demand, increase its contribution to global greenhouse gases \n(GHGs), and heighten exposure to commodity risk. \n \n3.  The Government of Indonesia recognizes the economic imperative of sustainable growth \nand aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the country\u2019s primary energy supply from \n5% in 2010 to 25% by 2025 and achieve a reduction in GHG emissions of 41% by 2020.3 \nIndonesia is endowed with several renewable  energy options that can help achieve these \ntargets,  including  wind,  solar,  geothermal,  and  biomass.  However,  geothermal  energy  is \nparticularly suited to support Indonesia\u2019s more sustainable future: \n(i)  Geothermal power comes from thermal energy that is naturally generated in the earth \nand most accessible and abundant near tectonic plate boundaries.4 Due to its location at \nthe edge of the Pacific plate, Indonesia has over 29,000 megawatts (MW) of geothermal \nresources, which is equivalent to 40% of the global geothermal resource base.5  \n(ii)  Geothermal power plants are reliable and demonstrate high capacity factors. Therefore, \nthey can contribute a sizable portion of base-load power, unlike intermittent renewable \nenergy sources such as wind or solar, and contribute to a more secure energy mix. \n(iii)  Geothermal power plants typically emit less than 10% of the GHG emitted by fossil fuel \nthermal plants, and thereby provide an effective means for Indonesia to achieve both \ndomestic and international climate change mitigation objectives.  \n(iv)  Power generation costs of large geothermal power plants in Java and Sumatra are less \nthan the country\u2019s average power generation cost. Geothermal sector development can \ntherefore  help  improve  the  long-term  financial  health  of  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara \n(PLN), the national electricity utility, while reducing Indonesia\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels.6 \n                                                \n1 The ADB Clean Technology Fund is financed by the Clean Technology Fund and administered by ADB. \n2 Bank of Indonesia. 2013.

Indonesia has a geothermal project pipeline of 3,200 MW, which accounts for 24% of the \ncapacity  of  geothermal  projects  now  planned  globally.7 Despite  the  compelling  opportunity \npresented by untapped geothermal resources, less than 5.0% of the country\u2019s total geothermal \npotential has been developed. Indonesian geothermal regulation has substantially improved \nsince 2003, but translating the immense geothermal opportunity into reality is challenging due to \nthe risks of proving and managing the geothermal resource. The investment needed to develop \nthe country\u2019s full geothermal potential will only materialize when actual and perceived risks are \ndecoupled and reduced through the successful financing, implementation, and operation of \nprojects with the demonstrative capacity to initiate market transformation. \n \n5.  Recent sector development. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) involvement in the \n320 MW Sarulla Geothermal Power Development Project has placed ADB at the forefront of \naccelerating private sector investment in geothermal development in Indonesia.8 The Sarulla \nproject  is  the  first  large-scale,  private  geothermal  project  to  be  commercially  financed  in \nIndonesia in over 10 years. Nonetheless, for landmark projects like Sarulla to achieve their full \ndemonstration  impact,  more  projects  must  overcome  critical  bottlenecks  in  the  geothermal \nproject pipeline further upstream. The highest level of risk for a geothermal developer is during \nearly project development and exploration, when the renewable energy resource has not yet \nbeen proven. Experienced developers in Indonesia are challenged to justify their investments \nwhen faced with full exposure to the high upfront costs of a drilling program and the inequitable \nrisk\u2013reward  framework  in  the  geothermal  sector.9 The  lack  of  an  early-stage  risk  sharing \nmechanism remains a fundamental obstacle to geothermal power expansion in Indonesia and \naround the world. For ADB to effectively kick-start the Indonesian geothermal sector, it must not \nonly facilitate the availability of long-term commercial financing, but also clear the way for new \nproject development by initially sharing and mitigating some development risk.  \n \n6.  Clean Technology Fund. As one of the four windows under the $8 billion global Climate \nInvestment Funds, the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) is a major partner in ADB\u2019s efforts to \nmitigate GHG  emissions  and  accelerate geothermal  development  in Indonesia.10 CTF  was \nestablished in 2008 and promotes financing for the deployment of low-carbon technologies with \nsignificant potential for long-term reduction of GHG emissions through projects implemented by \nthe multilateral development banks. ADB is one of five multilateral development banks endorsed \nby the bilateral financing partners that contribute funds to the CTF.  \n \n7.   The proposed project will be ADB\u2019s second loan from the $150 million ADB Private \nSector Geothermal Energy Program, which was approved and endorsed by the CTF trust fund \ncommittee in 2013.11 The program specifically seeks to share a portion of the upfront risks of \n                                                \n7  Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 2013.

Manila. \n9  Due to drilling programs, capital costs for geothermal plants can be more than three times those for conventional \nfossil fuel plants. In addition, future development of the geothermal market is unlikely to benefit from the dramatic, \ntechnology-driven cost reductions that have recently occurred in the solar, wind, and natural gas sectors.

Establishment of the ADB Clean Technology Fund and the ADB Strategic Climate Fund. Manila. \n11 The trust fund committee approved the program pursuant to the Financial Procedures Agreement entered into by \nADB and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (as trustee of the trust fund for CTF) on 18 \n ", "  3 \ngeothermal drilling and exploration faced by private developers. Under the program framework, \nADB selects a set of private sector subprojects according to CTF investment principles, program \ncriteria, and minimum loan terms and conditions approved by the trust fund committee.  \n \n8.  The relatively high risks of the early-stage loan product were explained to the committee \nwhen  ADB  sought  program  approval,  and  the minimum terms  and  conditions  of this  loan \nproduct have been endorsed. While concessional CTF funds have traditionally been deployed \nas parallel project finance loans, the CTF mandates the implementing agencies to identify the \nmost effective structures to mitigate key sector risks, pilot-test alternative financing modalities, \nand  disseminate  project  lessons,  all  while  maximizing  the  leverage  of  other  investors  and \nlenders. By filling the financing gap and galvanizing activity further upstream, the proposed \nassistance will demonstrate the viability of geothermal resources in Indonesia and increase the \nlikelihood of attracting the commercial investment required for the geothermal sector expansion. \n2.  Project Design  \n9.  The proposed 240 MW Rantau Dedap Geothermal Development Project (Phase 1) is an \nideal  opportunity  for  ADB  and  CTF  to  play  an  instrumental  role  in  developing  the  next \ngeneration of greenfield geothermal projects in Indonesia through pilot-testing of an innovative, \nearly-stage  financing  product.  The  project  is  located  about  225  kilometers  southwest  of \nPalembang in South Sumatera, Indonesia. Phase 1 constitutes the initial geothermal resource \nexploration, involving the drilling of five wells to better ascertain steam reservoir characteristics \nand capacity. A separate Phase 2 project will follow to complete drilling of production and \ninjection wells, and power plant construction. Phase 2 will be financed through a traditional \nlimited-recourse, long-term financing structure. \n \n10.  The project has been prioritized under PLN\u2019s long-term power development plan and the \nsecond  10,000  MW  accelerated  development  program  launched  by  the  Government  of \nIndonesia in 2010 (Fast Track Program 2). Phase 1 development has commenced under the \nframework of a 35-year geothermal mining license, a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) \nwith PLN, and an approximately 20-year guarantee from the Ministry of Finance, as stipulated \nunder a business viability guarantee letter (BVGL) signed in 2012. Overall, the project benefits \nfrom strong contractual arrangements with creditworthy parties such as the Government of \nIndonesia, rated BB+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s, and PLN, rated BB by \nStandard and Poor\u2019s and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s. \n3.

Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n12.  Impact.  The  project  impact  will  be  commercial  financing  for  Phase  2  (steamfield \ndevelopment  and  power  plant  construction),  which  will  support  the  government\u2019s  progress \ntoward its renewable energy and climate change mitigation targets. Phase 2 will directly support \nclimate change mitigation  through  an  estimated  net reduction  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions \nequivalent to 1.1 million tons per year. Successful deployment of concessional financing during \nthe high-risk phase of this project will be instrumental in overcoming financing and development \nhurdles  in  the  sector,  catalyzing  more  private  investment  in  geothermal  energy  by \ndemonstrating the resource viability in Indonesia and by increasing investor interest. \n \n13.  Outcome and output. The outcome of the project will be the confirmation of Phase 2 \nbankability after the Phase 1 exploration activities. The project output will be the successful \ncompletion of Phase 1, the early site development and drilling program. \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n14.  Consistency with Strategy 2020. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, \nwhich  emphasizes  support for  environmentally sustainable growth  and  development  of the \nprivate sector.13 The strategy supports expanding environment-friendly technologies for clean \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2008.

Furthermore, the ADB Clean Technology Fund loan \nadministration increases direct, value-adding investment in nonsovereign projects supporting \nmultiple strategies and objectives under ADB\u2019s finance ++ approach.14 \n \n15.  Consistency with the country strategy. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014 for Indonesia.15 It  supports  the  strategy\u2019s  second  pillar  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  through  climate  change  mitigation,  which  prioritizes  projects \ndesigned to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. The project also promotes the \ngovernment\u2019s long-term objective to deploy CTF resources to leverage commercial financing of \ngeothermal  projects. 16 The  assistance  complements  recent  ADB  public  sector  technical \nassistance to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and to PLN for renewable energy \ndevelopment, including the review and revision of geothermal tariff schemes and government \ngeothermal risk mitigation mechanisms.17 \n \n16.  Consistency with the sector strategy. The project is consistent with the ADB Energy \nPolicy support for renewable energy.18 Although ADB reached its internal goal of $2 billion per \nannum in clean energy in 2011, the project helps sustain that level of investment in 2014 and \nfurther bolsters the private sector role in catalyzing additional resources for renewable energy. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), the project is classified category B for environmental impact, category A for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and category B for indigenous peoples. 20 The potential environmental \nand  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been  identified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid, \nminimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts have been incorporated in the \nsafeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity and commitment of the borrower to \nmanage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. Information \ndisclosure and consultations with stakeholders and affected communities have been conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements. \n \n19.  While the project is located in a forest area, it is unlikely that short-term exploration will \ncause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  that  are  irreversible,  diverse,  or \nunprecedented. No environmentally sensitive areas have been identified. Nonetheless, ADB is \nworking with the borrower to ensure that habitat values are protected during Phase 1 and better-\ntargeted  baseline  biodiversity  surveys  are  initiated  for  a  robust  environmental  impact \nassessment for Phase 2. Project impacts mainly arise from access roads, facilities, and well pad \nconstruction. To that end, road crossings have been constructed to ensure that river flows are \nmaintained  and  erosion  and  sediment  impacts  are  minimized.  Plans  to  rehabilitate  and \nrevegetate disturbed areas at the completion of the exploration phase are in place. Impacts from \ndrilling operations and vehicles are insignificant. Due diligence confirmed that the borrower has \na comprehensive health, safety, and environmental management system and plans in place \n(including identification of company and contractor roles and responsibilities). Furthermore, the \nborrower demonstrated active incident reporting and corrective action.  \n \n20.  The land acquisition for the 108.5 hectares of land required for Phase 1 has been \ncompleted  through  negotiated  settlements.  An  audit  of  the  land  acquisition  process  and \ncompliance  with  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nimpacts on indigenous peoples was carried out. The audit confirmed that all 153 project-affected \n                                                \n20 The Initial Environmental Examination was disclosed on the ADB website in May 2014 and the Social Safeguards \nCompliance Audit Report and Corrective Action Plan was disclosed on the ADB website in April 2014. ", "  7 \nhouseholds have been compensated based on the negotiated compensation rates for land, \ncrops, assets, and structures. About 80% of the population in the project area belongs to the \nSemendo ethnic group, and the borrower has taken up the implementation of an integrated \nsocial development program to manage the adverse impacts on Semendo community and to \ncarry out developmental activities in the area. The audit confirms that the land identified for the \nproject is neither traditional land nor land with customary rights. The Semendo community fully \nsupports the project and is anticipating benefits from the project through social programs and \nemployment. Corrective actions have been determined and agreed upon with the borrower.  \n \n21.  Other  social  dimensions.  An  assessment  of  existing  operations,  human  resource \npolicies, and current procedures for labor procurement and management has confirmed that \npolicies conform to national labor laws and regulations on the protection of rights and interest of \nwomen. The borrower requires its contractors to engage local labor, including women. ADB will \nensure  that  loan  documentation  includes  provisions  requiring  the  borrower  to  comply  with \nnational  labor  laws  and,  in  addition,  to  take  specific  measures  (including  in  relation  to \ncontractors) in line with internationally recognized core labor standards and in compliance with \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.21 \nB.  Anticorruption Policy   \n22.  The sponsors and the borrower were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date), and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \nof Terrorism (2003).22 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency,  ADB  requires  the  borrower  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption and money-laundering activities and the financing of terrorism; and to \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities.   \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n23.  The proposed loan will not count toward the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-project  exposure  limits  for  nonsovereign  investments,  as  it  will  be  funded  by  CTF \nresources, not ADB ordinary capital resources.  \nD.  Assurances \n24.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Indonesia\u2018s no objection to the proposed assistance to Supreme Energy Rantau \nDedap  will  be  obtained.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of \nDirectors. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n25.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the administration by \nADB of a loan up to $50,000,000 to be provided by the ADB Clean Technology Fund to \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2003.
