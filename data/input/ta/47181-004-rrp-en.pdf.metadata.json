THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  second  additional  financing  of  the  Water  Resources \nManagement in the Pyanj River Basin Project.1 \n \n  The grant will contribute to financing the cost overrun of the original project for the \nconstruction of a sediment excluding basin (SEB). This is a key infrastructure component for \nachieving the project\u2019s outcome and for optimizing project costs. The SEB will ensure that the \nwater quality in the Chubek Irrigation System (CIS) is suitable for agricultural production. It will \noptimize operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the CIS in the long-term by reducing \nsediment inflow. The cost overrun was identified during detailed technical surveys and structural \ndesign under the original project. Actual site conditions were inconsistent with the assumptions \napplied for the feasibility-level design of the SEB prepared during project preparation. The \ntechnical design of the SEB requires substantial revision to achieve its anticipated sediment-\nremoving function. This will result in a cost overrun.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original project on 28 September 2016. \nIt aims to support agricultural development in the Pyanj River Basin (PRB) by improving the \ngovernment\u2019s  water  resources  management  (WRM)  capacity  and  increasing  agricultural \nproductivity and water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture.2 The project became effective on 8 \nAugust 2017. The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MEWR) and the Agency for Land \nReclamation and Irrigation (ALRI) are the executing agencies.3  \n \n  Under the MEWR-led component, the project has established a river basin organization \nand provided support to strengthen its capacity for river basin management. This includes \nimproved monitoring of water use for irrigation. The project supports Tajikistan\u2019s contribution to \nthe joint management of the PRB through the Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan PRB commission.4 Under \nthe ALRI-led component, the CIS, including its irrigation and drainage (I&D) infrastructure and \npumping stations, are to be modernized and climate-proofed. The project also supports capacity \nbuilding of farmers and water user associations (WUAs) to boost water use efficiency and \nagricultural productivity. \n \n  The  first  additional  financing  of  the  project  was  approved  on  21  June  2018.5 This \n \n1  ADB. Republic of Tajikistan: Water Resources Management in Pyanj River Basin Project; and ADB. Republic of \nTajikistan: Water Resources Management in the Pyanj River Basin Project (Additional Finance). The original project \nwas approved in 2016; the first additional financing was approved in 2018. In this report, \u201congoing project\u201d pertains \nto both the original project and the first additional financing, while \u201coverall project\u201d refers to the original project, first \nadditional financing, and proposed second additional financing. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant and \nAdministration of Grant for Additional Financing to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Water Resources Management \nin the Pyanj River Basin Project. Manila. \n ", "2 \nexpanded  the  scope  of  the  original  project  to  include  capacity  building  and  institutional \ndevelopment of the State Agency for Hydrometeorology of Tajikistan (Hydromet). It also provided \nquality climate services to ALRI, MEWR, and other key stakeholders for WRM, agricultural \nproduction, and disaster risk reduction in the PRB. It became effective on 7 March 2019. Hydromet \nis  the  executing  agency  for  the  first  additional  financing.  Improved  information  delivery, \nforecasting, and early warning by Hydromet will (i) support efficient WRM and agricultural \nproductivity among river basin organizations,6 WUAs, and farmers; and (ii) reduce disaster \nimpacts on settlements, water resources, and irrigation infrastructure.  \n \n  The original project included an SEB at the intake of the CIS to limit sediment entry to the \nirrigation system, prevent damage to pumps for lifting irrigation water to the command area, and \nreduce future O&M costs for sediment removal. During project implementation, modifications in \nthe design parameters for the SEB resulted in a revised design. The newly designed SEB is a \nlarger structure with an updated configuration and higher investment cost.7 The revised design \nwill ensure that the originally anticipated purpose of the SEB is achieved.  \n  \n  The second additional financing will bridge the financing gap to complete the construction \nof the SEB and achieve the project\u2019s outcome. The SEB is essential to achieving the output 2 \ntargets by (i) reducing sediment load entering the CIS canal from the Pyanj River, (ii) increasing \nthe irrigation conveyance efficiency of on-farm canals in the CIS,8  (iii) increasing the efficiency of \npump stations in the CIS, and (iv) providing access to water for selected households. \n \n  The ongoing project is performing well based on the following assessment:9  \n(i)  Project performance. Progress for the ongoing project is on track. It is expected that \nall activities will be completed within the project period. The original project was rated \nas a potential problem from the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2018 until Q1 2019. This was \nlargely due to the delay in procurement of the two major civil works packages, \nincluding that for the SEB. The executing agency could not commence procurement \nbefore initiating the processing of the additional financing. The rating is on track since \nthese major civil works packages have been awarded.10 All project implementation \nconsultants\u2019 teams have also been recruited and are providing services. No major \npackages are pending procurement. The original project has been rated on track \nsince Q2 2019. To accommodate the construction period of the SEB, the loan and \ngrants closing date of the original project was extended by 2 years, from 30 June \n2022 to 30 June 2024. As of 31 July 2020, of the total loan and grant amount of $28.0 \nmillion for the original project, cumulative contract awards totaled $22.3 million (or \n80.0% of the total loan and grant amount) and cumulative disbursements totaled $6.1 \nmillion (22.0%). The first additional financing has been on track since becoming \neffective in March 2019. As of 31 July 2020, of the total grant amount of $11.5 million, \ncumulative contract awards for the first additional financing is $2.3 million (20.0%), \nwhile cumulative disbursement amount is $1.0 million (8.6%). \n(ii)  Compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements.  The  ongoing  project  is \n \n6  Multiple river basin organizations are being created by different donors in line with the Water Sector Reform \nProgramme 2016\u20132025 adopted by the Government of Tajikistan in 2015. \n7  The SEB in the original project was about 100 meters wide by 500 m long. The revised SEB is about 240 m wide by \n764 m long.  \n8  Irrigation conveyance efficiency is defined as \u201cthe amount of water reaching the irrigated field, divided by the amount \nof water conveyed from the source.\u201d \n9  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 One civil works package was awarded in July 2019, and the other package that includes the SEB which was awarded \nin July 2020.  \n ", "3 \ncategorized B for environment and C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. No significant adverse social or environmental impacts are expected, as \nphysical activities are primarily conducted on existing irrigation systems. The project \ncomplies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Safeguards due diligence \nreports and the initial environmental examination have been updated based on the \nlatest design of the SEB. To date, safeguard policy requirements have been complied \nwith and no outstanding corrective actions are required. \n(iii)  Delivery of expected outputs. The ongoing project is successful in meeting its \nintended outputs: (a) water resources in the PRB better managed, (b) modernized \nand  climate-proofed  CIS  WRM  infrastructure  fully  operational,  and  (c)  farm \nmanagement capacity and water use skill improved. \n(iv)  Management of risks. Management of identified risks is successful. The 2018 audit \nmanagement  letter  identified  internal  control  risks  related  to  budget  execution, \nmanagement of fees and penalties, and tender documents. ALRI has taken measures \nto address these. The project has adequate arrangements to manage risks. The \nproject implementation groups (PIGs) of ALRI, MEWR, and Hydromet implement the \nproject  activities.  The  project  implementation  consultants  support  the  PIGs  in \nmanaging  technical,  financial,  and  procurement  risks  and  other  aspects  of \nproject implementation. \n \n  Overall, the eligibility criteria for additional financing have been met. The ongoing project \nremains technically feasible and is expected to sustain its economic viability in the long term. The \nfinancial sustainability of the project is a challenge. This is in the context of financing of O&M \ncosts,  irrigation  system  fee  (ISF)  adequacy,  ability  of  users  to  pay,  and  rigorous  asset \nmanagement. The Government of Tajikistan will need to substantially increase annual O&M \nallocations through the increase of ISF. It will also need to introduce a continuous annual ISF and \ntariff  adjustment  mechanism.  ADB  will  continue  to  work  with  the  government  to  financial \nsustainability  by  accessing  grant  allocations  from  the  12th  replenishment  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF 13) to improve debt management. This will enhance project efforts to \nsupport a more structured approach to O&M cost rationalization and allocation of suitable budget \nfor O&M, within a public financial management context. \n \n  The second additional financing is a high priority for the government,  and remains \nconsistent with the project\u2019s development objectives. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Tajikistan, 2016\u20132020.11 The second additional financing is aligned with \nthe ADB Strategy 2030 operational priority on promoting rural development and food security, \nand with the strategy\u2019s guiding principles of promoting innovative technology and delivering \nintegrated solutions.12 \n \n  Tajikistan is experiencing significant adverse economic and social impacts from the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Food security in Tajikistan is at risk from the impact \nof COVID-19 and prices of essential food items increased during Q1 2020, affecting the poor.13 \nThe second additional financing will contribute to increased agricultural productivity and food \nsecurity  by  improving  irrigation  system  performance.  The  impact  of  COVID-19  on  project \nimplementation will not be significant. This is since the country does not have restrictions on \ninternal movement of people. Although Tajikistan\u2019s borders have been closed for passenger \n \n11 ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Tajikistan, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n12 ADB. 2018.

The government has not imposed in-country movement restrictions and this will \nenable civil works planned under the project to be implemented.  \n \n  The International Monetary Fund assessed Tajikistan to be in high debt distress, further \njeopardized by the COVID-19 situation.14 This will impact the project\u2019s financial sustainability in \nterms of availability of the O&M budget and ALRI\u2019s ability to continue to collect and adjust the ISF. \nThrough a separate technical assistance,15 ADB will support a broader sector-wide initiative to \naddress systemic issues of debt management and improved allocation of O&M budget for \nirrigation and water resource infrastructure in Tajikistan. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n  The impact and outcome for the overall project will remain unchanged with the inclusion \nof the second additional financing. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) irrigated \nland  in  good  condition and  food  security  increased,16 (ii)  efficiency  of water resource  use \nincreased,17 and (iii) climate resilience of agriculture and WRM improved.18 The project will have \nthe  following  outcomes:  (i)  agricultural  production  increased  in  CIS  area  of  PRB,  and  (ii) \nagricultural productivity and relevance of forecasting services increased in the PRB.19 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n  The second additional financing will cover the cost overrun of one civil works package \nunder output 2 of the original project and will not directly contribute to outputs 1 and 3. \n \n  Output  2:  Modernized  and  climate-proofed  Chubek  Irrigation  System  water \nresources  management  infrastructure  fully  operational  (unchanged).  This  includes  (i) \nrehabilitation, modernization, and climate-proofing of I&D infrastructure; (ii) construction of an \nSEB; (iii) modernization and rehabilitation of pumping units; and (iv) capacity development of ALRI \nstaff. The first component will cover the Chubek main canal, including the head regulator, escape \nstructure, cross regulators, offtake structures, inter-farm and on-farm I&D canals and associated \nstructures. ALRI will remove the sediment along the main and inter-farm canals using machines \nto be procured under the original project, while WUAs and farmers will remove the sediment along \non-farm I&D canals. The flow capacities of canals have been checked against the climate change \nrisks anticipated during the next 50 years and augmented where required. With modernization \nand rehabilitation, irrigation conveyance efficiency will increase from the present 60.0% to 66.0% \nfor gravity-fed systems, and to 82.0% for pump-fed systems. \n \n  The second component will reduce the CIS O&M requirements, as the larger SEB will \nremove about 85.0% of sediment entering the main canal. The second additional financing will \ncover the cost overrun to construct the larger SEB (para. 6).

The energy efficiency of the two pump systems will \nincrease from less than 50.0% at present to more than 75.0%.20 In addition, a feasibility study will \nexplore alternative cost-efficient water supply methods for the irrigated area under the two \nremaining pump systems. Under the fourth component, the capacities of local ALRI offices, \nincluding the WUA support unit, will be enhanced to perform tasks such as water and sediment \nflow monitoring and recording; monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of irrigation performance; and \nO&M of the CIS main infrastructure. This will be with the provision of equipment, training, and an \nM&E system.  \n \nD.

Technical \n \n  The project will reduce O&M requirements and improve the sustainability of the CIS. \nSediment deposits in the CIS resulting from high sediment loads in the Pyanj River have increased \nO&M costs. The larger SEB to be constructed under the project will trap sediment flowing into the \nCIS. This will mitigate sediment deposits in the main and secondary irrigation canals and limit \ndamage to pumps for lifting irrigation water. The SEB will ensure that the project outcome and \noutputs are achieved. \n \n  The structural design of the SEB is technically feasible. Its detailed structural design was \nreviewed by applying the latest sediment particle size data, taking into account topographic and \nhydraulic survey results.26  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n  The  project  is  expected  to  be  economically  viable  in  the  long-term.  The  project\u2019s \nrecalculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 22.7% and the economic net present value \n(NPV) is $25.4 million (TJS239.4 million) at a discount rate of 12.0%.27 This compares with an \nEIRR of 16.3% and an economic NPV of $15.7 million (TJS105.7 million) estimated at appraisal.28 \n \n26 Technical Report on Design Changes of the Sediment Excluding Basin (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n27 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n28 In 2015 prices and using a 12.0% discount rate. A 12.0% discount rate has been also used in the updated economic \nanalysis, consistent with the discount rate used at appraisal. However, in sensitivity testing, the effect of the lower \n9.0% rate was examined given a lower rate now suggested in the latest guideline: ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. Manila. At a discount rate of 9.0%, the NPV is $45.7 million (TJS431.8 million) and \nthe EIRR is 22.7%. \n ", "8 \nThe higher updated EIRR and NPV, despite the increased cost for the SEB construction, is largely \nthe result of adjusting the calculation of agricultural production without the project. This was \noverestimated at project appraisal.29 Based on the sensitivity analysis, the project viability is \nobserved to be most sensitive to benefits being delayed by 2 years, which causes the EIRR to \nreduce to 17.4%.  \n \n  By year 13 (2028), the project will result in an increase in net farm incomes from increased \nagricultural production of $207/ha (TJS1,952/ha) per annum, excluding returns to labor. Including \nreturns to labor (both farmers' own and hired labor) gives increased incomes in the project area \nof $291/ha (TJS2,743/ha) per annum. With an average farm size of 0.5 ha in the command area,  \na farm household is expected to receive an increase in income of $146/ha (TJS1,372/ha) per \nannum. This includes returns to labor and assuming only household family labor is used. Farmers \nwill also benefit from reduced costs and reduced time involved in sediment removal from on-farm \ncanals (although ALRI incurs most of these costs off-farm).30  \n \n  The project\u2019s financial sustainability remains a challenge since the project appraisal and \nthe government requires additional support to improve its capacity for the O&M cost recovery. \nFinancial analysis demonstrated that the government increased the collection rate from 62.6% in \n2015 to 88.7% in 2019. It also increased water tariffs, but these remain insufficient to financially \nsustain the project.  \n \n  The overall approach of ALRI\u2019s annual budget allocation for O&M and its computations \nrequire comprehensive review. The O&M balance sheet for the CIS is projected to be negative \nfrom 2020 to 2026 based on the results of the financial sustainability analysis. To achieve financial \nsustainability with the project, an annual allocation of $450,596 for O&M costs and a 15.7% \nincrease in the ISF will be required. ADB will continue to support the government to address \nsector-specific financial sustainability issues. This will include capacity-building support in asset \nmanagement and calculating O&M budgets through a separate technical assistance (para. 12). \nADB will support the government to address systemic issues of debt management and improved \nallocation of O&M budget for irrigation and water resource infrastructure. The project covenants \nwill be strengthened to address the financial sustainability of the project by advancing the time \nframe for ALRI\u2019s delivery of the asset management and O&M plan to within 12 months from the \neffectiveness of the additional financing.31 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n  The financial management assessment  noted that ALRI and the PIG have suitable \ncapacity in project financial management, partially because of their prior experience and familiarity \nwith ADB\u2019s financial management requirements.32 The overall risk is considered moderate at the \n \n29 The EIRR at appraisal would have been 28% if agricultural production without the project had been correctly \ncalculated. There were also other adjustments that needed to be made to the appraisal economic analysis model. \nThe most significant of these was to include returns for some new crops (potatoes, carrots, onions, fodder maize, \nsoya beans, and alfalfa) in the with-project scenario that were omitted from the appraisal analysis. \n30 Footnote 2, Preliminary Asset Management and Operation Plan of Chubek Irrigation System (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). The project implementation consultants for output 3 estimated that only 5% of \nsediment removal costs were incurred directly by the farmers for the removal of sediment from on-farm canals. About \n10% of sediment settles in fields and 90% in the canal system. \n31 This will require amending the terms of the original loan agreement. The amendment of the original loan agreement \nfor the purpose of reflecting the time frame for delivering the asset management and O&M plan will be processed in \nparallel with the proposed grant agreement. \n32 ALRI and the PIG obtained experience on financial management through recent ADB projects such as Grant 0352-\nTAJ: Building Climate Resilience in the Pyanj River Basin Project and the ongoing project.  \n ", "9 \nproject level. Because of its small budget allocation, ALRI does not have an internal audit \nrequirement under the government\u2019s regulations. It is subject to internal audit by the Ministry of \nFinance. The country\u2019s internal audit risk is considered substantial under the government\u2019s Public \nExpenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  report.33 The  2018  external  audit  for  the  project \nproposed recommendations to further strengthen internal risk mitigation measures, and ALRI \nmanagement agreed to these recommendations. Combining country public financial management \nrisks and project risks, it is concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nsubstantial. ALRI and the PIG have agreed to implement an action plan, which is detailed in the \nPAM (footnote 24). \n \n  According to the procurement capacity assessment, ALRI and the PIG to have sufficient \ncapacity in project procurement management. Considering that ALRI and the PIG staff have \ndemonstrated strong capacity in procurement under the original project, their capacity does not \nappear to pose a substantial risk to efficient and effective project implementation. \n \n  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  ALRI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n  Poverty. The second additional financing will contribute to addressing low agricultural \nyields, low income, and food insecurity in the target areas. This will be by reducing sediment inflow \nto the canal system, which will improve O&M of the CIS. It will ensure a sufficient supply of \nirrigation water in the command area and improve agricultural productivity, thereby contributing \nto household incomes.  \n \n  Social and gender. The second additional financing is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming  as  it  will  continue  to  ensure  that  women  directly  benefit  from  the  project. \nComponents  include  (i)  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  PRB  Organization  and  PRB  Council \nmanagement structures; (ii) increased women membership in WUAs; (iii) improved women\u2019s \naccess to water for household use; and (iv) improved women\u2019s access to training on weather \nforecasting, flood warnings, and preparedness. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n  The second additional financing is classified category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples since it will be used exclusively to bridge cost overruns \nwithin the existing project scale and scope. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.34 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n \n \n33 Government of Tajikistan. 2017.

The consultant will support the establishment of a strong \nfocuses on compliance with  internal audit system and build the capacity of the PIG, finance staff, and accounting \nfinancial obligations  staff in financial project management and address audit recommendations. \nInsufficient available funds  Required O&M costs will be optimized by constructing the SEB under the additional \nfor system O&M may  financing. Degraded pumps and motor units will be replaced with energy-efficient \nthreaten CIS sustainability  models under the original project financing. The government agreed that ALRI will \nprepare and the government will approve a CIS asset management and O&M plan \nwith the support of the original project. Since 2015, the government has improved \nthe ISF collection rate from 62.6% to 88.7% and increased the water tariff. Although \nthis  remains  insufficient  for  financial  sustainability,  ALRI  will  prepare  a \ncomprehensive asset management and O&M plan for O&M computations and \nbudget allocations within 12 months from the effectiveness of the second additional \nfinancing. The asset management and O&M plan will include components to \nincrease ISFs and the budget allocation for O&M. This will substantially increase the \navailability  of  O&M  funds  and  support  full  cost-recovery  in  the  CIS  after \nmodernization and rehabilitation works have been completed. The main system \noperators and WUAs will be trained in efficient CIS O&M under the original project. \nADB  will  also  support  the  government  to  address  systemic  issues  of  debt \nmanagement and budget allocations for O&M.
