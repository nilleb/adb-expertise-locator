INTRODUCTION \n1.  The capacity development technical assistance (TA) for Support to Primary Education \nDevelopment is included in the country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Bangladesh.1 \nThe Government of Bangladesh, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and nine development \npartners2 have been jointly implementing the Third Primary Education Development Program \n(PEDP3) since FY2012.3 The program provides financing depending on the achievement of \nselected  results\u2014called  disbursement-linked  indicators  (DLIs)\u2014and  the  government  and \ndevelopment  partners  have  agreed  on  a  joint  mechanism  to  review,  verify,  and  improve \nreporting on DLIs and other results. Because ADB and the development partners use the \ngovernment\u2019s  treasury  system  for  project  disbursement  and  financial  management,  close \nfiduciary oversight and support for system improvement in public financial management (PFM) \nwas agreed at the start of PEDP3. TA support for fiduciary oversight, implementation, and \nresults reporting has been provided since the start of the program.4 Given that a new primary \neducation program is planned to start in the first quarter of 2018 and PEDP3 is planned to close \nin the second quarter of 2018, it was agreed to lend support for fiduciary oversight and PFM \nimprovement, and for implementation of the final stages of PEDP3 and the transition to the new \nprogram.5 Subsequently, the government requested ADB\u2019s support to strengthen the capacity \nfor program implementation and to assist the transition to the new program.6 The TA was \ndiscussed and agreed on during a TA fact-finding mission in October 2016. The government \nconcurred with the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, output, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference.7 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bangladesh has made significant progress in improving the participation and retention \nrates of boys and girls in primary education. The primary education completion rate increased \nfrom 70.3% in 2011 to 79.6% in 2015, and net enrollment increased from 94.9% to 97.9% in the \nsame period. The percentage of grade 1 students in primary schools who have attended pre-\nprimary education has steadily increased since 2013 and reached 96% in 2015. However, \nchallenges remain in reducing dropout and repetition rates and in improving the quality of \neducation,  particularly  in  disadvantaged  areas.  The  sample-based  National  Student \nAssessment demonstrated that only 25% of students master grade 5 Bangla competencies.8 \nPEDP3 always had a strong focus on improving the quality of education, while at the same time \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

Annual Sector Performance Report 2016. Dhaka. \n ", "2   \naiming to sustain and improve where possible the efforts to widen access to education. PEDP3 \nsupports four key reforms of the national education policy:9 (i) establishing an integrated school \nsystem under a framework that unifies the public, nongovernment organizations, and private \nproviders; (ii) improving quality through smaller class sizes, better teaching practices, and a \nfocus  on  literacy  in  information  and  communication  technology;  (iii) decentralizing  primary \neducation  administration  and  management;  and  (iv)  engaging  in  partnerships  with \nnongovernment organizations and the private sector.  \n \n3.  Focus  on  results.  Success  in  managing  reforms  in  large  systems  such  as  the \nBangladesh  primary  education  system  depends  largely  on  the  government\u2019s  capacity  for \neffective targeting, planning, and management of resources to achieve the intended results. \nPEDP3 has since its start supported the development of institutional capacity in planning and \nfinancing based on results, has established a robust monitoring and evaluation system, and has \npromoted accountability for results through improved results reporting. The joint midterm review \nof PEDP3 confirmed in August 2014 that the results-based approach using the treasury system \nwas yielding good progress\u2014for one, the use of DLIs had shifted the nature of policy dialogue \ntoward attention to outputs, outcomes, and policy implementation and brought a sharper focus \non  results.  Second,  the  use  of  the  treasury  system  and  electronic  procurement  had \nstrengthened  the  governance  and  accountability  of  these  systems.  Third,  harmonization \nbetween development partners had been exemplary, with well-coordinated communication and \nreview mechanisms, and joint decision-making by all partners, which showed the strength of the \nsector-wide approach. Based on these findings, ADB and several other development partners \nagreed to provide additional financing in FY2015 to maintain the momentum of the ongoing \nprogram and to fund the extension of it.10  \n \n4.  To ensure that the implementation of the program remains on track, achievement of \nagreed results,  especially  DLIs, must  be  properly  monitored  and  assessed;  and  additional \nimplementation support must be given in core result areas such as infrastructure, gender, and \nquality, especially during the closing of the ongoing program and the transition to the new \nprogram. Technical assistance will support the implementation and monitoring of the large \nconstruction program, to ensure that capacity is built up, safeguards are complied with, and the \ninfrastructure  DLI  is  achieved.  This  assistance  will  also  support  the  transition  to  the  new \nprogram by helping draw lessons and identify new options in the field of infrastructure, with a \nfocus on increasing inclusiveness and disaster resilience. The support for gender aspects will \nfocus on supporting and strengthening gender reporting and mainstreaming in the remaining \npart of the program. The support for improving the quality of education will focus on monitoring \nachievement of the DLIs in the areas of quality, including teacher education, curriculum, and the \nprimary education completion exam, and on assisting implementation to achieve these results. \nThe support will also help ensure that DLI reporting meets the requirements. \n \n5.  The new program will build on the lessons from the ongoing programs in primary and \nsecondary education. The results-based approach, using government systems where possible, \nand harmonized development partners\u2019 support in a sector-wide approach under government \nleadership, will be continued and further strengthened. As part of the preparation for the new \n                                                \n9  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Education. 2010. National Education Policy. Dhaka. \n10  ADB, the European Union, the Global Partnership for Education, the International Development Association, and \nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund provided additional financing. The additional financing covers the increased \ncost of construction, the cost of an overall salary increase, and additional costs for the 1-year extension; and allows \nto scale up successful project interventions, such as appointing additional teachers and improving teacher \neducation to increase impact and development effectiveness.  \n ", "  3 \nprogram, assessments of PEDP3 were agreed.11 In line with the direction set out in the national \neducation policy and in the Sustainable Development Goal 4, a first draft action plan to expand \nprimary  education  to  grade  8  was  developed;  it  is  built  upon  an  implementation  strategy \nprepared for secondary education with ADB TA support in 2012.12 A committee consisting of \nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education and from the Ministry of \nEducation is responsible for finalizing the action plan. To achieve this, targeted support was \nrequested. Specific actions to be determined concern improvements in the quality of education \nby adjusting the curriculum and teacher education, and effecting examination reforms in the \nmedium term. Actions to ensure inclusive and equitable access for all children up to grade 8 will \nbe based on an analysis of the expected number of students, available schools, and demand-\nside interventions. Since the primary and secondary education systems are currently under \ndifferent  governance  and  financing  structures,  options  for  medium-term  institutional  and \norganizational changes will be developed. An action plan to expand primary education to grade \n8, accepted by all stakeholders, would support the primary and secondary education programs \nnow being prepared. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the proposed TA will be an efficient, inclusive, and equitable primary \neducation system in Bangladesh, which is aligned with the outcome of PEDP3 and the tentative \noutcome for the next primary education program. The outcome of the TA will be that planning \nand results management capacity in primary education is improved. This will be measured \nthrough  (i) the  action  plan  to  expand  primary  education  from  grade  5  to  grade  8,  to  be \nincorporated by 2017 as part of the new program; and (ii) the annual core program results to be \nachieved in 2017 and 2018, as recorded in the DLI progress reports. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will provide assistance to the executing and implementing agencies in planning, \nmonitoring, and reporting in key result areas. The first output is the reform to expand primary \neducation developed. The TA will support to further develop the action plan to expand primary \neducation to grade 8, with a focus on analyzing requirements for ensuring access, quality, and \norganizational  changes  in  the  medium  term.  The  second  output  is  the  results  reporting \nimplemented.  The  TA  will  focus  on  the  implementation  of  improved  annual  core  program \nactivities and results reporting on infrastructure, gender, quality of education, and administration \nand monitoring, as well as assist in the transition to the new program in the core result areas \nespecially relevant to the DLIs. The proposed TA period will be from January 2017 to June \n2018. \n \n8.  Institutional capacity development may be affected by slow decision-making at the policy \nlevel. High turnover of the government\u2019s focal points can also lead to delays in issuance of \nessential  reports.  The  close  oversight  by  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development \n                                                \n11  The assessments that are planned, ongoing, and/or completed cover institutional capacity, quality of education, \nresults of information and communication technology interventions, PFM, monitoring and evaluation capacity, \nreduction in the numbers of out-of-school children, expansion of primary education to grade 8, and a rapid program \nassessment. \n12  ADB.  2011.

Manila (TA \n7719-BAN). \n ", "4   \npartners,  and  the  extensive  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  conducted  through  the \ndevelopment partners\u2019 consortium and joint working groups will aim at managing these risks to \nproduce the planned outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $315,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, coordination support, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education will be the executing agency and the \nDirectorate of Primary Education the implementing agency. ADB will administer the TA. The TA \nwill be implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n11.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) for a total of 31 estimated person-months, \ncomprising 9 person-months of international and 22 person-months of national consultants.   \n \n12.  Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  support  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nreporting activities in the core components of PEDP3 (infrastructure, quality, and gender), and \nfor targeted support in further developing the access, quality, and organizational parts of the \naction plan for expansion of primary education to grade 8. Each consultant will deliver an \nindividual,  distinct  output.  The  following  experts  will  be  needed:  (i)  education  specialist \n(international, 3 person-months), (ii) implementation specialist (international, 6 person-months), \n(iii) senior infrastructure specialist (national, 14 person-months), (iv) education quality specialist \n(national,  3  person-months),  (v)  education  economist  (national,  3  person-months),  and \n(vi) gender specialist (national, 2 person-months). \n \n13.  The TA team will work closely with the PEDP3 development partners\u2019 consortium and \nthe working group structure set up to support and monitor PEDP3 implementation and prepare \nthe  design  of  the  new  program.  The  TA  will  be  monitored  periodically  through  review  of \nconsultants\u2019  reports  and  in  meetings  of  the  joint  working  groups  of  the  Government  of \nBangladesh and the PEDP3 consortium.13 Lessons drawn and best practices adopted will be \ndisseminated through the aide-m\u00e9moires of the PEDP3 joint review missions and post-PEDP3 \npreparation and joint review missions; the reports will be shared by the working groups and \nwider stakeholders. Lessons from the action plan for expansion of primary education will be \n                                                \n13  The government and the development partners have structured policy dialogue, implementation support and \nmonitoring for PEDP3, and the design of the next program. Six joint working groups are each focusing on specific \nareas: (i) access to education-related issues, including gender and inclusive education, in the Disparity Working \nGroup; (ii) curriculum reform, examination reform, teacher education, and other quality of education components in \nthe  Quality  Working  Group;  (iii)  procurement,  financial  management,  audit  and  fiduciary  oversight  in  the \nProcurement and Finance Working Group; (iv) organizational development, teacher recruitment, and monitoring \nand evaluation in the Administration and Monitoring Working Group; (v) infrastructure in the Infrastructure Working \nGroup; and (vi) expansion to grade 8 and decentralization in the Cross Cutting Working Group. Coordination of \nworking groups for joint, overarching issues is managed through a joint technical committee, in which the Ministry \nof Education also participates, during review missions, and in the PEDP3 consortium for development partner-\nrelated issues. Each working group is chaired by the government with a co-chair from among the development \npartners.  \n ", "  5 \nshared with all relevant stakeholders in dedicated sessions. Other development partners will \nprovide complementary TA for the assessments of PEDP3, the transition to the next primary \neducation program, and in the area of result monitoring and reporting (footnote 6).  \n \nIV.
