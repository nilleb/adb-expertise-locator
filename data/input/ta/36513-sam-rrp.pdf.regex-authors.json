The  Project  will  complement  and \nexpand Education Sector Project II 2006\u20132012 (ESP II) activities to \ninclude ICT competencies and best practices for developing and using \ne-learning resources in classroom teaching and learning processes. \nThis will enhance the quality of education and cost-effectively improve \nstudent learning outcomes in six academic subjects aligned to the \nESP II priorities of mathematics and science. It will also support the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to improve the overall efficiency of the education \nsector  and  help  to  develop  management  models  and  partnership \narrangements to ensure the sustainability of the project outcomes. The \nProject  will  foster  the  use  of  the  Internet,  where  possible,  and \ncommunication among schools domestically and internationally. The \nGovernment,  through  its  Samoa  Development  Strategy  2005\u20132007 \n(SDS) and Strategic Policies and Plan July 2006\u2013June 2015 (SPP), is \nfully committed to achieving efficiency and quality goals in education \nand aligning the education sector with the national ICT strategy.  \n \nThe Project will have four main components: (i) improving the quality \nof teaching and learning in secondary schools; (ii) improving access to \neducation  through  ICT;  (iii) establishing  the  Community  Access \nProgram  and  developing  its  partnerships;  and  (iv) strengthening \neducation  management  and  coordination,  including  improving \nanalyses of economic efficiency, equity, and sustainability. \n \nThe Project will be implemented in two stages. This will allow the \nGovernment to assess the impact of SchoolNet and ICT on learning \noutcomes  and  postsecondary  employment,  and  will  contribute  to \nstrengthening the research and evaluation capacity of MESC.  \n   ", "ii   \nRationale  Education  remains  a  priority  of  the  SDS.  The  sector  has  shown \nsignificant achievements, including an adult literacy rate of 98.7%, the \nhighest in the Pacific region. About 90% of grade 8 completers have \naccess  to  secondary  education.  Gender  disparities  have  been \neliminated at the primary level and are declining at the secondary \nlevel.  \nDespite many achievements in education, however, the quality and \nefficiency of education remain disappointing. Variations in student\u2019s \nlearning  achievements  and  opportunities  for  learning  remain \nsignificant, particularly between urban and rural areas. In 2006, the net \nenrollment  rate  at  the  primary  level  was  69%,  while  the  gross \nenrollment  rate  was  97%.  More  than  25%  of  students  enrolled  in \nprimary education did not complete the 8-year program. The same \nyear, the dropout rate was 7% for grades 1\u20132, 5% for grade 8, 18% for \ngrades 10\u201311, 3% for grade 12, and as high as 41% for grade 13. \nRepetition rates at grades 1, 8, 11, 12, and 13 are high and largely \nchanged since 1997. In 2006, 88% of primary students progressed to \nlower secondary level and 91% to upper secondary level, but only \nabout 53% of 12th graders advanced to grade 13.  \n \nMany of the issues in the education sector will be addressed under the \n \nongoing ESP II. However, ESP II has limited emphasis on using ICT \nas a tool to enhance student learning outcomes or to manage the \neducation  system.  The  Project  will  link  with  ESP II  to  complement \nactivities under it and will be implemented within the ESP II structure to \naddress  these  issues.  MESC\u2019s  capacity  will  be  strengthened  to \nimplement additional activities under the Project.  \nInternational evidence indicates the importance of ICT capacity and \nskills as a key factor for national and global economic development. \nThe Government is committed to introducing ICT in education. The \nProject provides an opportunity for MESC to meet its ICT objectives, \nbuilding on lessons learned in the SchoolNet pilot funded by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Samoa will be the first Pacific developing \nmember country to provide universal access to ICT-based instruction \nand Internet access to secondary schools. The design of the Project \nwill provide important information on the costs and effectiveness of ICT \nfor student achievement and future employment.  \n \nThe Samoa experience will be of great value to other countries in the \nPacific and to the development community toward further developing \nICT strategies. The issue of ICT literacy is of particular importance in \nSamoa, as 35% of the population works overseas and remittances \nconstitute 17% of the gross national income.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  proposed  Project  will  help  the  Government  achieve  a  more \nequitable and effective ICT-enhanced education system and promote \nlife-long  learning.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  enhanced \nlearning outcomes for secondary students and improved knowledge \nsharing through ICT. \n ", "  iii\nProject Investment  The total project cost is estimated at $6.90 million equivalent, including \nPlan  contingencies, local taxes, and duties. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Source  Total    Percent \n  Asian Development Bank  5.9    85 \n \nGovernment  1.0    15 \n  Total    6.9    100 \n       Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nGrant Amount and  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $5.9 million  from  its  Special  Funds \nTerms  resources  to  finance  85%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  remaining \n$1.0 million (15%) will be provided by the Government. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  MESC will be the implementing agency. The existing ESP II Education \nArrangements  Steering Committee will be responsible for the Project and may co-opt \nmembers to include other main project stakeholders and so provide \nstrategic  direction  and  oversight  to  the  Project.  The  Steering \nCommittee will meet as necessary but not less than once every 6 \nmonths. A Technical Advisory Committee will be established to advise \nthe  Steering  Committee  on  technical  matters.  It  will  consist  of \nrepresentatives with ICT expertise from local information technology \ncompanies,  the  Ministry  of  Communications  and  Information \nTechnology,  Samoan  Information  Technology  Society,  National \nUniversity of Samoa, and MESC. MESC will have overall responsibility \nfor managing project implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and \nreporting  progress,  in  coordination  with  ESP II.  At  the  operational \nlevel, the Project will be managed by the MESC Core Executive and \nsupported  by  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  SchoolNet \nproject manager, and ESP II Secretariat.  \n \nAll components of the Project will be implemented through the existing \nMESC  organizational  structure  and  coordinated  with  the  ESP II \nimplementation  schedule.  The  Project  has  a  2-stage  design,  with \nstage 2 contingent upon successful completion of stage 1. Consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Core \nExecutive to deliver the Project. MESC will appoint a full-time project \nmanager, who will work in coordination with the MESC Core Executive \nand ESP II coordinator and assist in procurement, planning, reporting, \nmonitoring, and record keeping. The project manager will report to the \nMESC Core Executive. The ESP II Secretariat and SchoolNet project \nmanager will coordinate activities, supported by a consultant project \nmanagement adviser, for the smooth operation of the Project. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance   \n   \n ", "iv   \nProcurement  All goods and services financed under the Project will be procured in \n  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). All procurement packages valued to be \nabove $1 million will be procured following the international competitive \nbidding procedures. Procurement of equipment up to $1 million will be \nprocured using national competitive bidding and procurement of goods \nand services below $100,000 will follow shopping procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide about 72 person-months of international and \n108 person-months of national consulting services. All international \nand associated national consultants will be selected and recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Most international consulting services \nwill be provided by one firm. Provision is made to recruit individual \nconsultants for the project management adviser position and for the \nunallocated person-months as needed during the life of the Project. \nThe Project will use the quality-based selection method to recruit a \nfirm.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit students, teachers, and communities in Samoa \nBeneficiaries  by  (i) improving  learning  tools,  education  curricula,  and  student \nlearning outcomes; (ii) establishing communication access points for \nschools and communities; (iii) establishing school management tools; \n(iv) building  capacity  in  the  use  of  ICT  and  in  financial  planning, \nresearch,  and  evaluation;  and  (v) enhancing  partnership  across \ngovernment agencies with donors and other stakeholders. In addition, \nother Pacific developing member countries and donor organizations, \nincluding  ADB,  will  benefit  from  lessons  learned  through  the \nimplementation  and  evaluation  of  the  first  comprehensive  national \nSchoolNet program in the region. The provision of national coverage \nthrough  investments  in  data  communications  equipment  will \nsignificantly  lower  the  cost  of  eventually  extending  ICT  to  primary \nschools and other institutions.  \n   \nRisks and  Risks associated with the Project are (i) uncertain long-term financial \nAssumptions  support  for  the  system,  (ii) weak  managerial  capacity  to  support \nschools  and  teachers,  and  (iii) potential  lack  of  interest  in  the \ncommunity. \n \nIt is assumed that the Government will maintain its commitments to \nthis  Project  and  develop  and  enforce  appropriate  policy.  It  is  also \nassumed that MESC will recruit and retain managerial and technical \nstaff to support the initiative.  ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Independent State of Samoa for the SchoolNet and Community Access Project (the \nProject). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Samoa is an independent Pacific island country with a small but open economy. Lack of \nopportunity  and  income  vulnerability,  often  exacerbated  by  external  economic  shocks  and \nnatural disasters, contribute to hardship in rural areas, particularly on the island of Savai\u2019i. \nDespite its vulnerability, Samoa has experienced stability and moderate economic growth. Its \nreal gross domestic product (GDP) grew between 1993 and 2007 by an annual average of 4%, \nthe highest rate among Pacific island economies. Poverty is not a problem; private remittances \nfrom the 35% of the population living abroad are substantial (17% of gross national income), \nand  the  extended  family  system  redistributes  income  effectively.  External  aid  represented \n11.5% of gross national income in 2005. The 1999 Pacific Human Development Report ranked \nSamoa seventh among 15 developing island economies in the Pacific region, and Samoa \nranked 75th globally in the 2006 Human Development Report.1  \n \n3.  Education remains a priority for the Government. The sector has shown significant \nachievements, including an adult literacy rate of 98.7%,2 the highest in the region. About 90% of \ngrade  8  completers  have  access  to  secondary  education.  Gender  disparities  have  been \neliminated at the primary level and are declining at the secondary level.3 Samoa has made \nconsiderable progress toward achieving Education for All targets and Millennium Development \nGoals, and management capacity in the Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture (MESC) has \nbeen substantially strengthened. All this provides a foundation for further developing the sector. \n \n4.  In April 2007, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MESC confirmed their commitment to \nexpanding SchoolNet and the Community Access Project (CAP), and requested grant funding \nfrom ADB to (i) consolidate the work undertaken in the SchoolNet pilot, (ii) provide technical \nsupport to integrate the e-learning approach in the Education Sector Project II (ESP II), and \n(iii) expand SchoolNet to include additional schools and their respective communities to bridge \nthe digital divide and increase employability and knowledge sharing.4  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis    \n5.  Despite  good  progress  in  education,  significant  challenges  persist.  Variations  in \nstudent\u2019s opportunities for learning and learning achievement remain significant, particularly \nbetween urban and rural areas. High expenditures on education (equivalent to 8.7% of GDP \nand  29.9%  of  total  government  expenditures  for  (FY)  2006\u20132007  have  not  provided  the \n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Pacific Human Development Report 1999; Human Development \nReport 2006. Colombo. \n2  Based on the 2001 census. Data from the new census conducted in October 2006 are not yet available.  \n3  An emerging characteristic of education in Samoa is that, as a group, girls perform better than boys, and there is a \nneed to address this situation (Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture. 2006. Strategic Policies and Plan July \n2006\u2013June 2015. Apia [p.12]. \n4  During the Fact-Finding Mission, the Government requested that the Project cover all government and mission \nsecondary schools as they have better infrastructure than primary schools. ADB agreed in line with evidence in \nBritish Education Communication Technology Agency studies that information and communications technology \ninterventions had better applicability at the secondary level. Coverage in all 22 districts will lay the groundwork for \neventual expansion to the primary level. ", "2   \neducational outcomes envisaged.5 In 2006, the net enrollment rate at the primary level was \n69%, while the gross enrollment rate was 97%. More than 25% of the students enrolled in \nprimary education did not complete the 8-year program. The same year, the dropout rate was \n18% for grades 10\u201311, 3% for grade 12, and as high as 41% for grade 13. Repetition rates at \ngrades 11, 12, and 13 are high, and have not  changed since 1997. Also in 2006, 88% of \nprimary students progressed to lower secondary level and 91% progressed to upper secondary \nlevel, but only 53% of 12th graders advanced to grade 13. A major effort is required to address \nthe  problems  of  equity,  relevance,  and  quality  of  learning  achievements,  as  well  as  the \neffectiveness of resource utilization. MESC\u2019s Strategic Policies and Plan July 2006\u2013June 2015 \n(SPP) identifies deficiencies in the education sector that need to be addressed. Appendix 2 \nprovides an analysis of the sector.  \n \n6.  Many of the issues in the sector will be addressed under the ongoing ESP II 2006\u20132012 \nto achieve better learning outcomes for both primary and secondary students. ESP II was \napproved in 2005 and is supported by ADB, Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID), New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID), and the Government \nusing a sectorwide approach (SWAp).6 ESP II focuses on (i) curriculum reform and assessment \nsystems;  (ii) developing  effective  teachers;  (iii) improving  access  to  high-quality  education; \n(iv) strengthening  capacity  to  undertake  research,  evaluation,  and  policy  analysis;  and \n(v) planning\u2014as  well  as  strengthening  capacity  to  implement  and  manage  development \nprojects.  Since  ESP II  effectiveness  in  mid-2006,  MESC  has  completed  various  activities \nincluding  overall  coordination  and  reporting  arrangements.  However,  ESP II  uses  mainly \ntraditional methods to achieve high quality and efficiency in the sector. Its scope does not \ninclude  well-conceptualized,  integrated,  and  sustainable  capacity-development  activity  to \nsupport information and communications technology (ICT) as a tool to enhance student learning \noutcomes and manage the education system.  \n \n7.  ICT plays an important role in good education.7 ICT capacities\u2014such as simulation, \nmind maps, illustration of complex and abstract concepts and results, collaboratively working on \nprojects, and accessing extensive global databases for new ideas\u2014both enhance the quality of \nthe learning experience and significantly motivate students. The imperative for education is to \nincrease access to ICT and inculcate among students the capacity to adopt life-long learning, to \nconstantly seek and critically analyze new information, and to develop capacity to use ICT as a \ntool to cope with the challenges of a fast-changing world. Innovations in ICT, together with the \nassociated productivity tools, are increasingly changing the socioeconomic landscape of many \ncountries.  Yet  in  Samoa,  access  to  ICT  facilities  is  still  limited.  The  ICT  policy  of  the \nGovernment is to ensure access for all Samoans with a focus on introducing ICT in education. \nThe capacity of ICT and associated tools that can be provided through SchoolNet needs to be \nembedded  within  an  e-learning  vision  to  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  policy  objective.  To \ncomplement the activities of ESP II and address the problem, the Project will be implemented in \ncoordination with ESP II and incorporate an e-learning and e-training approach to support all 42 \ngovernment and mission secondary schools (out of a total of 44 secondary schools). It will also \n                                                 \n5   These figures include both government allocations and external support to the sector.  \n6  AusAID and NZAID participated in the Fact-Finding Mission for the proposed Project and provided extensive \ncomments on the draft project design. AusAID and NZAID may provide support to learning center administration by \nproviding youth ambassadors and volunteers, as well as study tours to New Zealand and Australia for staff of the \nCurriculum Materials and Assessment Division and MESC IT Unit for capacity development. \n7  In recent years, ADB has implemented projects in the area of ICT in education (Supplementary Appendix A). A \nmajor international conference on ICT in education was held on 16\u201318 October 2007. Government officials from \ndeveloping member countries and private sector ICT providers attended, indicating the changing focus at ADB.  ", "    3 \nprovide community access to the learning centers that will be established in all 42 secondary \nschools to support life-long learning and business operations.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n8.  Recent reviews of the education sector8 identified several issues related to access to \nhigh-quality education, as discussed below. The Government, through its Samoa Development \nStrategy 2005\u20132007 (SDS) and SPP, is fully committed to achieving efficiency and quality goals \nin education. Though primary education efficiency and quality issues will be addressed under \nESP II, access and quality issues at the secondary level will need attention to improve student \nlearning outcomes and systemwide efficiency.  \n \n9.  Lack  of  Access  to  High  Quality  Secondary  Education.  High-quality  learning \nopportunities are not available to all students. Schoolchildren and teachers outside Apia are \nphysically isolated from those in the capital and have limited access to good teaching resources, \nlibrary  facilities,  and  alternative  knowledge  sources.  Similarly,  well-trained  teachers  with \nadequate skills to effectively facilitate learning and manage classroom activities are in short \nsupply, especially in rural areas. Rural teachers cannot travel often to Apia for in-service training \nand refresher courses. They tend to be isolated, with poor interaction with their peers and little \nopportunity to exchange professional experiences.  \n \n10.  The key concepts of quality and efficiency require urgent attention, as noted in MESC\u2019s \nSPP. This concern is consistent with new initiatives directed at understanding how efficiency \nand quality are linked. A consensus is emerging that an economic definition of efficiency (which \nincludes the quality dimension) is essential in assessing a system\u2019s efficiency. Research shows \nthat differences in individual earnings and rates of economic growth are more closely linked to \naverage performance on international standardized tests than on average years of schooling.9 \nDevelopment agencies now focus on quality and unit cost data as the bases for assessing \nefficiency. ADB and the World Bank stress learning outcomes, rather than enrollment, as key \nefficiency targets.10  \n \n11.  Use of ICT to Improve Access, Quality, and Efficiency in Education. The provision \nof ICT-enhanced learning centers in all 22 districts, adaptation of a curriculum, and provision of \nlearning materials that support the use of ICT skills across a range of curriculum subjects are \nnecessary to ensure an active ICT role in the education system. An ICT-based curriculum also \nrequires  a  new  set  of  assessment  strategies  that  measure  not  just  traditional  knowledge \nacquisition but specific skills and ICT competencies, problem-solving and research capacity, \nand the development of higher cognitive skills. In terms of curriculum development, the inclusion \nof ICT-related skills and opportunities presents new and unfamiliar challenges, and MESC will \nneed to examine a range of model ICT-based curricula from different countries. Curriculum \nMaterials and Assessment Division (CMAD) staff will need training to adopt and manage the e-\nlearning curriculum.  \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005.

ICT is a tool that can significantly improve teachers\u2019 access to training, allow them to \nactively communicate with peers, and address issues of isolation. But, even when teachers \nhave access to ICT tools, they rarely use them effectively for lack of confidence. To develop \nconfidence, they need both generalized ICT skills training and training in the use of ICT in a \nrange of individual subjects. Significant additional training is therefore required. The national \nteacher development framework11 has identified minimum ICT competencies for teachers. The \nGovernment should make these mandatory for teachers and ensure that they attend training \ncourses. MESC needs assistance in addressing these issues, as they are critical to sector \nsustainability. This effort will need to build on plans supported by ESP II to consolidate MESC \ndatabases to support sharing and analysis. \n \n13.  The country is divided into 22 districts, with eight on the island of Savai\u2019i and 14 on \nUpolu, including three districts in the Apia urban area (districts outside this area are considered \nrural). Samoa has three types of schools\u2014government, mission, and private\u2014for a total of 204 \nprimary and secondary schools. Of the total, government and mission schools account for 42 \nsecondary and 154 primary schools, of which 19.5% (24 primary and 14 secondary) are in the \nApia urban area, 47.9% (79 primary and 15 secondary) are elsewhere on Upolu, and 32.6% (51 \nprimary and 13 secondary) are on Savai\u2019i. The total number of students in the government and \nmission schools is 52,851, of whom 37,980 are primary and 14,871 secondary. \n \n14.  There is at least one primary school in each village and one secondary school in each \ndistrict. Electricity and telephone services are available in all districts and schools, and some \nschools  have  ICT  equipment  and  Internet  connections.  The  Government  should  therefore \nimprove access to high-quality secondary education by providing all secondary schools with e-\nlearning equipment and materials and, where possible, Internet connection and access to a \nbroad range of curricula, learning materials, and other quality-enhancing resources available \nthrough  SchoolNet  and  ICT.  This  will  be  particularly  important  for  remote  schools  serving \ndisadvantaged communities. The Government needs to ensure that including ICT in secondary \nschools will not impose an additional financial burden in the form of higher fees.  \n \n15.  ICT Infrastructure. While Samoa\u2019s two islands are served well by fixed and mobile \ntelephone infrastructure, Internet access is limited to Apia and a few other centers. Dial-up \nInternet connections are common, though slow, unreliable, and expensive. Wireless and digital \nsubscriber  line  connections  are  available  around  the  Apia  area,  where  most  users  live. \nInternational commercial Internet access is a monopoly of the state-owned operator. Retail \nprices of Internet access are high because of the low density of users in the country and the \nprofit margins of the operators and do not differ much across existing Internet service providers. \nTelecommunications regulations permit noncommercial international access, and the National \nUniversity of Samoa, diplomatic offices, and some church groups have their own links. While \ninternational access for both voice and data is mainly by satellite (with the exception of a \nmicrowave link to American Samoa), it is envisaged that Samoa will connect to one of the two \navailable Pacific undersea fiber cables in the near future. This is not, however, expected to \nmake a significant difference to retail costs unless the Government negotiates an special rate \nfor education. Wireless and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access technologies are \nexpected to be deployed broadly in the country in the next few years. The SchoolNet pilot data \ncenter and portal are currently hosted by a local Internet service provider and may remain there \nuntil  the  server  room  in  the  new  MESC  headquarters  is  established,  at  which  time  the \nSchoolNet portal and the consolidated database may be relocated. The Government should \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for the National Teacher Development \nFramework. Manila (TA 4738-SAM, approved on 16 December 2005, for $350,000).  ", "    5 \nconsider developing and implementing plans and policies for a universal services fund (or \nequivalent) 12 and  international  gateway,  to  ensure  that  surplus  capacity  and  budgetary \nresources can be made available to schools to (i) provide an affordable education network, \n(ii) fund capital replacement costs, and (iii) ensure the long-term financial sustainability of ICT in \neducation.  \n \n16.  Lack of Community Access to ICT. Communication and access to information are \nlimited in rural communities, contributing to isolation and missed opportunities and hindering \naccess to knowledge and skills that could help people generate income, maintain and improve \ntheir surroundings, and lead healthier and more productive lives. Lack of ICT capacity prevents \npeople  from  accessing  national  and  global  information  and  limits  their  prospects  for  self-\nemployment  or  job  enhancement  at  home  and  abroad.  Weak  school  and  community \npartnerships undermine their potential to act as catalysts for national rural communications or as \nrural  service  delivery  points,  or  to  provide  a  basis  for  income  generation  to  support  the \nSchoolNet  initiative.  A  need  therefore  exists  to  make  the  learning  centers  accessible  to \ncommunities after school hours and, in so doing, support the Government objective of universal \naccess to ICT and allow communities to improve communication and knowledge sharing. \n \n17.  Limited Management Capacity. Management capacity is limited in Samoa in general. \nRecent interventions considerably strengthened MESC\u2019s capacity to manage the education \nsystem. For example, school management committees have been established; nearly all school \nprincipals  have  been  trained  in  school  management  and  planning  school  improvement \nprograms; and a minimum standard baseline checklist has been developed. However, further \ncapacity building is required both for schools and ICT learning centers. Currently, MESC has a \nstaff of only two: one information technology (IT) systems specialist and one technician to \nmanage MESC IT services. As the 42 additional schools, as well as CMAD and the School \nOperations Division (SOD), join the ICT system, capacity will be seriously strained. One staff \nmember will need to be located at the education resource center on Savai\u2019i to provide technical \nsupport to all secondary schools on that island.13 Another staff member will be needed to \nprovide general support services (a help line) and maintain the data center. The Government \ntherefore should ensure that (i) sufficient resources including staff are provided to the MESC IT \nunit, (ii) SchoolNet management committees are formally established in local communities, and \n(iii) MESC staff participate in capacity building. Strongly supportive school management is \ncritical for developing a school confident of its IT capabilities.  \n \n18.  External  Support.  External  funding  concentrates  heavily  on  the  education  sector \n(Appendix  3).  AusAID,  European  Union,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA), \nNZAID, United Nations agencies, and others have been involved in various education projects. \nTheir funding has included important support for curriculum development, teacher training, \ninstructional materials, and capacity building. The European Union and JICA have provided \nsupport  for  primary  school  construction.  ADB,  along  with  the  Government  and  school \ncommittees, has allocated $7 million for civil works, furniture, equipment, library materials, and \n                                                 \n12 Many countries both industrialized (e.g., United States and Canada) and developing (e.g., Belarus and Namibia) \nhave adopted the universal services fund concept. The government legislates and establishes a fund financed \nthrough  telecommunications  companies.  Legislation  requires  the  fund  to  have  a  reserve  for  providing \ntelecommunications services to lower-income residents and underserved villages. The regulator in Samoa has \ndrafted legislation for a universal services fund that is currently tabled for the Cabinet\u2019s consideration. \n13 MESC currently uses a Peace Corps volunteer to do the work, but if no counterpart is assigned by MESC there will \nbe no capacity when that person leaves. If MESC intends to use Peace Corps volunteers in the short to medium \nterm, there should be an agreement with the Peace Corps to ensure that these IT-skilled volunteers will be \navailable. That should be included in the MESC Strategic Plan for ICT. \n ", "6   \nteacher training under the recently completed ESP I. ESP II is providing limited IT equipment to \nMESC. Currently, the International Telecommunication Union and United Nations Development \nProgramme are supporting the Telecenters Project, through which computer equipment and \nlimited Internet connection are provided. JICA has provided technical assistance for designing \nand strengthening the National University of Samoa\u2019s ICT capacity.  \n \n19.  Lessons  Learned. Lessons from earlier interventions in Samoa and elsewhere are \nsignificant  (Appendix  4).14 The  key  one  is  that  well-targeted,  long-term,  and  coordinated \ninvestments  can  improve  the  quality  and  equity  of  education  provision,  including  ICT  in \neducation, but effective implementation of these initiatives at the school level is of central \nimportance. Hence, a well-supported, integrated approach is necessary to encourage MESC \nstaff to engage with the Project and to fully understand it. ESP I demonstrated that providing \nonly computers to schools has little impact on teachers\u2019 competencies or student learning \noutcomes. A well-planned short- and medium-term staff development plan should be prepared \nalong with e-teaching and e-learning resources. The SchoolNet pilot and RETA-6278 indicated \nthat  capacity  development  should  include  school  administrators,  MESC  head  office  staff, \nteachers, and principals. Schools provide a focal point in most communities and are the best \nlocation for ICT interventions. Experience suggests that a need exists to provide more support \nfor community awareness and management capacity to empower schools and communities and \nencourage their ownership of learning centers and their use of them without concerns for \nsustainability.  Experience  with  telecenters  in  education  indicates  the  need  to  adopt  open \npolicies to allow communities, government, and the private sector access to telecenters, and to \nshare the cost among them. Government policies have been found to be critical to sustainability. \nThere is a need to encourage multipurpose school and community access centers to be used by \ngovernment  departments  and  public  utilities  with  support  from  the  budgets  of  those \ndepartments. In some countries, school-based ICT centers also offer community services and \ntraining.  \n \n20.  General lessons are also available in the ADB Evaluation Information System.15 Several \nof them are reflected in the project design, as follows:  \n(i)  Flexibility in project design is essential to permit midcourse adjustments.  \n(ii)  A sector strategy and action plan should be developed for any education sector \nproject to provide future directions for overall sector development. \n(iii)  When formulating policy reforms, a comprehensive review and analysis of the \nsector,  followed  by  continuing  policy  dialogue  over  an  extended  period,  are \nimportant. \n(iv)  For vocational training graduates, more tracer studies of graduates must be \nconducted for future planning.  \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2000.

Samoa\u2019s first long-term education development plan, Education \nPolicies 1995\u20132005 and Education Strategies 1995\u20132005, had equity, quality, relevance, and \nefficiency  as  central  objectives.  The  second  plan  (the  SPP)  has  an  additional  focus  on \nsustainability. For its part, the SDS considers education a contributing factor to both economic \ngrowth and social development. SDS identifies improving the learning outcomes of primary and \nsecondary students as a national priority.  \n \n22.  The  Government  recognizes  that  improving  quality  in  education  service  provision \nthrough a SWAp is essential and that it may need to review resource allocations to different \neducation  subsectors  to  ensure  that  basic  education  is  funded  at  the  level  necessary  for \nachieving Education for All targets and Millennium Development Goals. The ICT policy of the \nGovernment  is  to  ensure  access  to  ICT  for  all  Samoans.  Through  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications and Information Technology master plan, National ICT Secretariat, and MESC, \nthe Government has introduced national ICT policies16 with a focus on introducing ICT in the \neducation sector.  \n \n23.  The ICT Communication Act establishes a monopoly for international access provision \nuntil mid-2009. Noncommercial traffic for the Internet, including voice-over-Internet protocol, is \nallowed.  The  National  ICT  Strategic  Plan,  which  was  recently  drafted  by  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications and Information Technology for developing the ICT industry, includes the \ndevelopment of e-government and e-commerce components. MESC also has an IT master plan \nthat outlines a policy framework for introducing ICT in the sector. This master plan is due for \nrevision, providing an opportune time to align MESC\u2019s strategic plan with an integrated vision for \nthe sector. \n \n24.  ADB  Strategy. Government policy guidelines are in congruence with ADB\u2019s Pacific \nStrategy (2005\u20132009)17 and the ICT Blueprint for the Future18 for the Pacific. ADB\u2019s ICT strategy \nfocus  is  on  (i) developing  capacity  to  use  ICT  to  overcome  constraints  associated  with \nsmallness and isolation, and to realize potential gains offered by links to a global market, and \n(ii) developing ICT as a tool in education and health, and as communication infrastructure for \nthe improved sharing of information and provisioning of basic services in working toward the \nMillennium Development Goals. ADB\u2019s draft Country Partnership Strategy (2008\u20132012) with \nSamoa  highlights  the  Government\u2019s  interest  in  expanding  the  SchoolNet  initiatives  to  the \nnational level to (i) improve the quality of education for all, especially for the disadvantaged; (ii) \nmeet the employment aspirations of the young; and (iii) contribute to an improved quality of life. \nFurthermore, ADB\u2019s Education and Training Sector Strategy for the Pacific (2005)19 emphasizes \nADB\u2019s commitment to increasing the use of new technologies, particularly ICT, in education. \nADB will continue its policy dialogue with the Government and support the development of a \npolicy environment that prioritizes equitable opportunities to learn. It will also continue dialogue \non reforms in the education sector that will provide resources for the operation and expansion of \nICT  in  education  and  encourage  public-private  partnerships  between  businesses  and \ncommunities to support social development.  \n                                                 \n16 See Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. 2006. Policy Guidelines for ICT Expansion in the \nCountry. Apia. In recent years, the Government has implemented these policies through, for example, the Country \nGateway Project, Women\u2019s ICT Project, National University of Samoa\u2019s expansion of ICT in education, and \nderegulation of the ICT sector.  \n17 ADB. 2005.

A study20 commissioned by ADB notes the importance of ICT as a critical tool providing \na competitive edge in an information- and knowledge-rich global economy. Moreover, ADB has \nplaced special emphasis on the dynamics of overseas employment and remittances, especially \nas they apply to Pacific island countries. Given the importance of remittances in Samoa, the \nProject  will  provide  an  excellent  opportunity  to  investigate  linkages  between  ICT  skills, \nemployment, and income.21  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n26.  The  proposed  Project  will  help  the  Government  to  achieve  a  more  equitable  and \neffective ICT-enhanced education system and promote life-long learning. The outcome of the \nProject will be enhanced learning outcomes for secondary students and improved knowledge \nsharing through ICT. \nB.  Outputs \n27.  The Project will focus on the secondary level, adopt an integrated ICT-in-education \napproach, and set up learning centers in all 42 government and mission secondary schools in \nall 22 districts. The Project will develop the capacity of about 800 teachers and provide ICT \naccess to about 1,500 secondary students and 22 communities. The Project will have four \ncomponents:  (i)  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  and  learning  in  secondary  schools;  (ii) \nimproving education access through ICT; (iii) establishing the CAP and developing partnerships; \nand (iv) strengthening education management and coordination, including improving analyses of \neconomic efficiency, equity, and sustainability. Outputs of component 1 are (i) e-curriculum \ncapacity  development  and  distribution,  (ii)  e-teaching  capacity  development,  and \n(iii) management  capacity  development.  Outputs  of  component  2  are  (i) the  provision  of  \nSchoolNet equipment and connectivity, (ii) the integration of the SchoolNet pilot with the Project, \n(iii) an extended network to connect MESC internally and with schools, (iv) a strengthened data \ncenter  and  portal,  and  (v) strengthened  MESC  ICT  capacity.  Outputs  of  component  3  are \n(i) community  access  and  use  of  SchoolNet,  (ii) strengthened  SchoolNet  and  CAP \nmanagement, and (iii)  partnership development. Outputs of component 4 are (i) strengthened \neducation management and coordination and (ii) improved analyses of economic efficiency, \nequity, and sustainability. \n \n1.  Component 1: Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning \n28.  This component will develop the capacity of MESC, teachers, and students from all \ngovernment and mission secondary schools in ICT competencies. The support provided for this \ncomponent will complement and expand ESP II activities to include ICT competencies and \ndeveloping and using e-learning resources in classroom teaching and learning processes. The \nProject will (i) provide consulting services to train 15,000 students; 800 secondary teachers; 21 \nschool review officers; and CMAD, SOD, and IT unit staff, locally as well as with overseas field \nstudies and workshops; (ii) adapt and/or purchase e-learning materials and courseware for at \nleast  six  secondary  subjects  (with  priority  on  mathematics  and  science)  and  two  ICT \n                                                 \n20  Eminent Persons Group. 2007.

", "    9 \napplications for community learning; and (iii) develop a SchoolNet management handbook. This \ncomponent will be led by CMAD but closely supported by SOD and ICT Unit. \n \n29.  E-curriculum  Capacity  Development  and  Distribution.  Complementing  ESP II \nactivities develop the capacity of CMAD staff, the Project will (i) expand capacity to adapt an e-\ncurriculum and to embed ICT as a learning and teaching tool in identified subjects and grades; \n(ii) upgrade CMAD\u2019s capacity to search for, identify, and evaluate suitable e-learning materials; \n(iii)  acquire  a  stock  of  appropriate  e-learning  and  teaching  materials  through  purchase, \nlicensing, adaptation, and localization; (iv) source and/or adapt local e-materials; (v) make e-\nlearning  materials  widely  available  through  SchoolNet;  and  (vi)  organize  and  distribute  e-\nlearning materials developed and/or sourced as required by CMAD. In addition, teachers and \nstudents will be trained in the use of productivity applications as part of teaching and learning. \nAssistance will be provided to CMAD to expand the inventory of e-learning materials, including \naccredited courseware available for ICT training.  \n \n30.  E-teaching Capacity Development. Under this subcomponent, the capacity of SOD \nand the National University of Samoa will be strengthened to jointly develop and deliver online \nprofessional  development  programs  for  teachers.  This  will  include  developing  the  ICT \ncompetencies of teachers in using e-learning materials and preparing lesson plans. As they \nbecome available, other tools will be integrated in their teaching practices. The new national \nteacher development framework lists ICT competencies as mandatory for all teachers, so there \nshould be in 3 years a sufficient supply of pre-service teachers with ICT competencies to offset \nany attrition to the private sector.22  \n \n31.  Management Capacity. The Project will build the management capacity of teachers, \nprincipals, school review officers, and learning center administrators in participating schools \nusing a training-of-trainers model. This will include the management of the school administration \nsystem, of SchoolNet administration, and of the learning centers. A SchoolNet management \nhandbook  will  be  developed.  CMAD  and  SOD  will  develop  monitoring  indicators  for  their \nactivities and implement a process to progressively evaluate the impact of their interventions. \n \n2.  Component 2: Improving Education Access through ICT \n \n32.  This  component  will  provide  learning  center  equipment  packages  to  42  secondary \nschools. While all government and mission secondary schools will participate, constraints of \ncapacity and logistics require that this component be implemented in three phases over a 3-year \nperiod. Schools will be selected for each phase to assure that there is a representative mix of \ncharacteristics to support the evaluation of impacts23 by means of a quasi-experimental design. \nA participating school receiving the learning center package will not impose fees or increase \nschool fees for the use of ICT without MESC approval. Supplementary Appendix B provides a \nconceptual design for measuring learning outcomes. This component will be led by the MESC \nIT Unit and the MESC Assets Management Unit (AMU) and supported by SOD. \n  \n33.  The  learning  centers  and  MESC  will  be  connected  through  a  wide  area  network \n(WAN).24 Initial  networking  will  be  provided  through  wireless  and  dial-up  technology.  An \n                                                 \n22 In the immediate term, the risk is low as the private sector is just beginning to embrace ICT as a productivity tool. \nIncentive schemes\u2014such as subsidized housing currently being developed for retaining rural teachers\u2014should \nalso be considered for retaining good ICT teachers. \n23  The evaluation of impacts is included in Component 4, as part of improving the analysis of sector efficiency. \n24  The connectivity design will use wireless broadband technology and a WAN for domestic networking, which is \ncosted as an annual fixed fee and not on traffic volume. This will significantly reduce the connectivity cost and \n ", "10  \ninternational connection will be established by an Internet link through a provider within or \noutside Samoa. Licensing will be obtained, as necessary, on a noncommercial basis. The \nProject will provide equipment, software, and consulting services for the LAN, WAN, and data \ncenter and portal, as well as for training and consultative workshops to strengthen MESC ICT \ncapacity and training (intensive face-to-face, field study, and mentoring). \n \n34.  Provision of SchoolNet Equipment and Connectivity. The Project will provide all \ngovernment and mission secondary schools with an e-learning center. Each center will be \nsupplied  with  computer  workstations;  servers;  peripherals  such  as  printer,  scanner,  video \ncamera, data projector, and networking equipment; related software; and consulting services. \nAn indicative learning center package (which may change during detailed project design) is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix C. Where current IT infrastructure permits, the center will \nbe connected to the SchoolNet network. The Project will help the Government to develop \npolicies and guidelines for disposing of obsolete equipment. Each school and its community will \nbe responsible for operating and maintaining its center. The maintenance of equipment and \nconnectivity will be part of contracts with the equipment suppliers.  \n \n35.  Integration of SchoolNet Pilot. The Project will review the performance of the LAN and \nWAN  provided  under  the  SchoolNet  Pilot  to  ensure  that  they  remain  fully  operational.  As \ntechnological and infrastructure changes occur in ICT, appropriate and up-to-date design is \nneeded to integrate the SchoolNet pilot sites with the Project.  \n \n36.  Extended Network to Connect MESC. The capacity of current equipment at CMAD; \nSOD; the Policy, Planning, and Research Division (PPRD); and the IT Unit will be reviewed for \ncompatibility with the SchoolNet network. With ESP II implementation units, compatible network \nequipment will be procured and installed, and wireless broadband connection commissioned, to \nlink to CMAD, SOD, PPRD, and the IT Unit. All other existing equipment and MESC intranet \nconnections will be standardized and connected to the SchoolNet network.  \n \n37.  Strengthened Data Center and Portal. The equipment of the MESC data center will be \nassessed for its capacity to provide high-quality and fast services, and it will be replaced if \nnecessary. Access and authentication will be provided for all participating schools and MESC \ndivisions. This will ensure that all schools have standardized access to e-teaching and e-\nlearning materials.  \n \n38.  Strengthened MESC ICT Capacity. Assistance will be provided to MESC to strengthen \nits ICT capacity to effectively manage and support the expanded SchoolNet network and its own \noperation.  Capacity  will  be  developed  through  on-the-job  and  specific  technical  training  in \nnetwork,  data  center,  and  portal  management.  Capacity  will  be  developed  to  manage  the \neducation management information system (EMIS) of MESC. Additional staff will be recruited \nand trained to manage the expanded SchoolNet network and focal points in schools. The \nGovernment will recruit or redeploy at least two staffers to the MESC IT Unit, who will be trained \nto manage the expanded network of schools and provide IT support services to all clients of the \nexpanded network. Furthermore, MESC will appoint two teachers in each school that it can \nensure will be available for training as SchoolNet administrators. School administrators will act \nas focal points and be responsible for their learning center.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nprovide unlimited use. Internet access will be provided through a single gateway from the WAN, allowing close \nmonitoring to manage cost. Also, visited websites will be cached at the data center and not require subsequent \nvisits to the Internet.  ", "    11 \n3.  Component  3:  Establishing  the  Community  Access  Program  and \nPartnership Development \n \n39.  This  component  will  support  MESC  and  the  participating  schools  to  make  learning \ncenters available to the surrounding communities. It will develop management models and \npartnership arrangements with existing school committees and private sector IT suppliers, which \nshould maximize project sustainability. The Project will provide consulting services and training; \ndevelop and distribute advocacy materials and a learning center administrative manual; and \nconduct consultative workshops. This component will be led by SOD and closely supported by \nthe MESC IT Unit and AMU.    \n \n40.  Community Access and Use of SchoolNet. School managers and/or principals will \nmake the SchoolNet learning centers accessible to the communities surrounding their school \nafter school hours. Support will include assistance in developing a plan and an administrative \nmanual for this, and in training community members in basic ICT skills. An advocacy program \nwill be developed and implemented to engage the community. This component is expected to \ncontribute  to  financial  sustainability,  as  small  fees  may  be  charged  to  recover  equipment \noperating and depreciation costs and for access and training.  \n \n41.  SchoolNet and Community Access Program Management. The Project will provide \nsupport to school managers to (i) develop locally appropriate policies to manage ICT equipment, \n(ii) plan types of services to be provided, (iii) develop and adopt a cost-recovery or cost-sharing \napproach, and (iv) develop procedures for staff to handle the daily administration of community \naccess. While improving the capacity of the community to take advantage of ICT, the CAP will \nalso  help  improve  the  sustainability  of  the  Project  by  charging  user  fees  for  day-to-day \noperation. The Government will ensure that SchoolNet management committees are formally \nestablished as subcommittees of the larger school committees.25  \n \n42.  Partnership Development. In support of sustainability, the Project will assist MESC in \ndeveloping and implementing a series of partnerships with other government agencies, donors, \nthe private sector, and other stakeholders. Key partnerships envisaged include those with (i) \nschool communities; (ii) government agencies; (iii) the donor community; (iv) religious groups; \n(v) civil society; and (vi) private sector ICT companies, both local and international, to provide \nservices at a subsidized connection rate or to accelerate and adopt the universal services \nfund.26  \n \n4.  Component  4:  Strengthening  Management  and  Coordination,  and \nImproving Analyses of Economic Efficiency, Equity, and Sustainability \n  \n43.  This  component  will  support  ESP II  activities  associated  with  enhancing  EMIS  and \nMESC capacity in ICT to increase management efficiency. It will undertake an impact study and \nprepare a medium-term expenditure framework and a financing framework for progress toward \nfinancial  sustainability.  The  Project  will  provide  consulting  services,  equipment  to  MESC \ndivisions and units, and training (including workshops). The component will be led by PPRD and \nsupported by the MESC IT Unit.  \n \n                                                 \n25 Under the SchoolNet pilot, subcommittees of the larger school committees were established. They had six \nmembers: three office-bearers who were from the school committees and three ordinary members. In some cases, \nthe ordinary committee members were chosen for their IT and business skills. \n26 See Supplementary Appendix D for discussions on detailed partnership agreements. These agreements are \nintended to address the efficient use of the learning centers and ensure sustainability.  \n ", "12  \n44.  Strengthened Education Management and Coordination. In close coordination with \nESP II, the Project will provide support to ensure that (i)  MESC has robust EMIS and evaluation \nsystems and (ii) capacity will be created to improve the management processes, including ICT \nsystems, for (a) school management, including student and teacher attendance records, asset \nmanagement, and facilities scheduling, and (b) learning, including grading, lesson plans, and \ncourseware management. Support will be provided for producing integrated project reports, \nreviews, and auditing. Data collection and analysis procedures will be developed further, using \nICT  tools  and  criteria.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  establish  processes  and  procedures  to \nintegrate SchoolNet with ESP II.  \n \n45.  Improved  Analyses  of  Economic  Efficiency,  Equity,  and  Sustainability.  Quasi-\nexperiments will be undertaken to evaluate SchoolNet\u2019s impact on student learning outcomes. \nThrough this subcomponent, the Project will finance the development of baseline measures of \nequity  and  efficiency  and  the  preparation  of  medium-term  expenditure  and  financing \nframeworks,  as  well  as  projection  models  for  assessing  and  monitoring  progress  toward \nfinancial sustainability.  \n \nC.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant Component \n46.  The Project is included in the Samoa Country Operations Business Plan 2007\u20132009, as \nrecently  approved  by  ADB,  with  an  allocation  of  $5.9 million  in  the  form  of  an  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) grant. Public sector debt has been declining since the early 1990s, \nfrom over 100% of GDP to about 38% of GDP in late 2006. Samoa will likely graduate soon \nfrom least-developed country status. However, the economy remains dependent on imports and \nvulnerable to climate and global price shocks. Although the debt situation is sound, there are \nconcerns that recent improvements in the debt-to-GDP ratios reflect large official investment \nflows for infrastructure for the 2007 South Pacific Games. The proposed ADF grant will ease the \nmacroeconomic impact of the Project\u2019s large financing requirements. \n \nD.  Special Features \n47.  Flexible Design. Based on lessons learned from the SchoolNet pilot and other general \nlessons, the project design incorporates a flexible approach. The fundamental design has been \nagreed with the Government. This includes the scope of the Project (all secondary schools), \nspecification  of  hardware  and  connectivity  standard  (SchoolNet  pilot),  management  and \nprocurement (ESP II congruent), monitoring and evaluation, and reporting and auditing. The first \nstage (about 12 months) will provide an opportunity for fine tuning based on the outcome of \nissues and priorities identified in the baseline study and an analysis of the efficiency of the \neducation system. This will be a key factor in risk mitigation. Also, as the technology changes \nconstantly, there will be a need to change and adopt the most suitable technology. While inputs, \noutputs, and outcomes can be predicted in other projects, ICT and SchoolNet projects need to \nconsider these rapid changes and adjust implementation accordingly.27 The proposal takes into \nconsideration the Project\u2019s complexity and the limited capacity in MESC, and has allocated \nadequate time and contingency for appropriate adjustments. \n \n                                                 \n27  This flexibility will allow the Project to respond to evolving opportunities such as (i) relocating the network operating \ncenter and the data center to MESC\u2019s new headquarters when it is ready and thereby reducing hosting costs paid \nto an Internet service provider, (ii) changing the Internet service provider to AusAID\u2019s Pacific Sky Project if it is \nready and cost effective, and (iii) joining the National University of Samoa if it expands its IT services to become \nthe national education network. Opportunities such as these will be monitored. ", "    13 \n48.  Consolidation with ESP II. To avoid a fragmentary and isolated approach, the project \ndesign is built on the extensive sector review undertaken for the ESP II development and \nadministrative framework and the recent SchoolNet pilot project reports. The Project will be \nimplemented using the same ESP II implementation structure and in coordination with the \nESP II implementation schedule as part of a SWAp. The Project will therefore complement \nESP II activities and contribute to achieving ESP II outcomes. To avoid any overloading of \nMESC capacity in implementing ESP II, the Project will provide consulting support to enable \nMESC to carry out project activities. However, to ensure that there is a clear separation in the \nuse of project funds, a sound accounting system will be established.  \n \n49.  Participatory  Approach.  The  Project  adopts  a  participatory  approach  and  close \ncoordination  with  all  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  as  well  as  with  nongovernment \norganizations, civil society, public and private school teachers, and church groups. The potential \ncapacity of ICT to enhance learning, and the Government\u2019s enthusiasm for expanding ICT-\ndriven learning opportunities, have been well supported by outcomes of consultative workshops \nand surveys during implementation of the SchoolNet pilot. Consultations were held with schools \nand communities through site visits and workshops during the implementation of the SchoolNet \npilot. In general, the schools and communities were very committed; communities considered \nthe education of their children a high priority and were keen to provide them with access to ICT \nopportunities.  \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n50.  The Project investment cost is estimated at $6.90 million equivalent, including taxes, \nduties, and contingencies. Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and are detailed in \nAppendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix E.  \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n52.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the Project, and MESC the Implementing Agency. \nThe existing ESP II Education Steering Committee will be responsible for the Project and may \nco-opt members to include other main project stakeholders and so provide strategic direction \nand oversight. The Steering Committee will meet as necessary but not less than once every 6 \nmonths. The Technical Advisory Committee, comprising representatives from the Ministry of \nCommunications and Information Technology, Samoan Information Technology Society, MESC, \nNational University of Samoa, and local IT companies, will be established to advise the Steering \nCommittee on technical matters. A SchoolNet project manager with appropriate qualifications \nwill be selected from within MESC or appointed by MESC to (i) assist MESC division heads in \nannual planning to ensure SchoolNet activities are not jeopardized at the expense of ESP II or \nvice versa; (ii) assist the MESC AMU in liaising with local ICT companies, Internet service \nproviders, and the schools and communities, as well as with procurement activities; (iii) assist \nthe  Secretariat  with  all  record  keeping,  report  developments,  and  follow  up  on  reporting \nrequirements; (iv) visit all project sites to test installation and to officially hand over to schools; \nand (v) assist the manager of AMU with the assets register.  \n \n53.  MESC will have overall responsibility for managing project implementation, monitoring \nand evaluation, and reporting of progress. At the operational level, the Project will be managed \nby the MESC Core Executive, comprising the chief executive officer (CEO), assistant CEOs, \nand AMU manager, and supported by the Office of the CEO, the SchoolNet project manager, \nand the ESP II program coordinator. All components of the Project will be implemented through \nthe existing MESC organizational structure and in coordination with the ESP II implementation \nstructure. Consulting services, including a project management adviser, will be provided to \nstrengthen the capacity of the Core Executive to deliver the Project. The ESP II Secretariat and \nSchoolNet project manager will coordinate with the project management adviser. Consulting \nservices, including a project management adviser, will be provided to strengthen the capacity of \nthe  Core  Executive  to  deliver  the  Project.  The  ESP II  coordinator  and  SchoolNet  project \nmanager will be supported by the project management adviser. The proposed management \nstructure is attached as Appendix 6.   \n  ", "    15 \n2.  Implementation Period and Process \n54.  The Project will be implemented in two stages over 5 years and completed by December \n2012.  In  Stage  1,  the  Government  will  prepare  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework \n(MTEF). It will also develop monitoring and evaluation indicators and collect comprehensive \nbaseline data, including quantified measures of unit costs, equity, and efficiency, and measures \nof secondary student competence in at least six academic subjects (e.g., mathematics and \nscience subjects) in line with ESP II, for ICT support. In addition, a system will be implemented \nto conduct tracer studies of secondary school graduates, to be conducted annually for the life of \nthe  Project.  The  Government  will  assign  schools  to  one  of  the  three  groups  for  phased \nimplementation, matching schools so that the three groups are  comparable.28 During this stage, \nwhich will last about 1 year from project effectiveness, MESC and MOF will also conduct an \nupdated sustainability analysis to ensure that assumptions are sound and that the Government \nis committed to efficiency reforms and to maintaining support at levels that will bring long-term \nfinancial sustainability. In particular, the analysis will review the recurrent cost implications of \nEPS II and SchoolNet.  \n \n55.  Stage 2 will be contingent upon the successful completion of all activities, including a \nsustainability analysis. Based on the results, the scope of Stage 2 implementation may be \nadjusted to ensure that the recurrent cost implications of the Project are consistent with the \nGovernment\u2019s sustainability projections. All activities in Stage 1 will be successfully completed \nprior to implementation of Stage 2, which will include (i) the procurement, installation, and \ncommissioning  of  ICT  equipment  for  the  learning  centers  and  MESC  data  center;  (ii)  the \nprocurement, installation, and commissioning of Internet connection for the learning centers and \nMESC  data  center;  (iii)  training  for  CMAD  and  SOD  to  develop  and  acquire  electronic \ncourseware; (iv) training teachers and technical staff; (v) monitoring and fine tuning the learning \ncenters\u2019 technical, educational, and financial performance; and (vi) establishing and monitoring \ncommunity  access  to  the  learning  centers.  Stage  2  will  include  ongoing  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the impact of the Project, including annual assessment of its impact on at least six \nacademic subjects as included in Stage 1. Detailed annual work programs for 2009, 2010, 2011, \nand 2012 will be developed in conjunction with ESP II based on progress to date and other \ndevelopments\u2014for example, connection availability. The rollout of equipment and connectivity \nwill be done in 3 phases for reasons of logistics and capacity. An implementation schedule is \ngiven in Appendix 7.   \n \n3.  Procurement \n56.  All goods and services financed under the Project will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from time to time). Any contract costing \nmore  than  $1  million  will  be  awarded  following  ADB\u2019s  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. All other contracts under the Project will be awarded following national competitive \nbidding (NCB) and shopping (for packages under $100,000),29 in accordance with government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Before the start of NCB procurement, ADB and the Government \n                                                 \n28  Constructing comparable groups will involve, among other things, getting approximately equal representation of \nrural and urban, Upolu and Savai\u2019i, and advantaged and disadvantaged schools, as reflected in access to public \nresources in the equity analysis. Schools will also be matched on student baseline characteristics such as gender, \nscores on the grade 8 exam, performance on new baseline assessment instruments, and experience of graduates \nin the Stage 1 tracer study. The four secondary schools that participated in the SchoolNet pilot will be excluded \nfrom evaluation. \n29  There are enough capable suppliers in Samoa to provide full competition, as was demonstrated during the \nSchoolNet pilot phase. \n ", "16  \nwill  review  the  Government\u2019s  procurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB \nrequirements. Any necessary modification or clarifications to the Government\u2019s procedures will \nbe  documented  in  a  revised  procurement  plan.  The  World  Bank  assessed  Samoa\u2019s \nprocurement procedures and legislation in 2003.30 NCB procedures are justified by the need for \nlocal after-sale support and to build local IT capacity in general. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and \ncontracts.  The  procurement  packages  are  indicated  in  the  procurement  plan  attached  as \nAppendix 8.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n57.  The Project will provide about 72 person-months of international and 108 person-months \nof national consulting services. All international and associated national consultants will be \nselected and recruited by MOF in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Most international consulting services will be provided \nthrough  one  firm.  The  main  areas  of  expertise  will  be  e-education,  ICT  in  education, \ncommunication  engineering,  education  and  management,  social  development,  education \nevaluation and assessment, educational economics, and project management. The Project will \nuse the quality-based selection method for recruiting the firm. Consultants will be requested to \nsubmit a full technical proposal. There is provision for individual consultants to be recruited for \nthe project management adviser position and for unallocated person-months as needed during \nthe  life  of  the  Project.  The  project  management  adviser  will  report  directly  to  the  ESP II \nSecretariat through the ESP II coordinator. Given the highly complex technical requirements \nand extensive capacity-building nature of the Project, much international expertise is needed in \nkey areas. Sufficient qualified expertise required for national consulting services is available in \nSamoa, as demonstrated by the SchoolNet pilot and ESP II. The outline terms of reference are \nin Appendix 9, with detailed terms of reference in Supplementary Appendix F.   \n \n5.  Advance Contracting \n58.  The Government requested ADB to approve advance contracting for consulting services. \nMESC may proceed with the selection, but not contracting, of consultants before the grant is \ndeclared effective. The advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants.  ADB  advised  the  Government  that  approval  of  the  advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to financing the ensuing Project. \n \n6.  Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n59.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  and  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n                                                 \n30  The World Bank report, Operational Procurement Review, concluded that in general Samoa's procurement \nprocedures  were aligned  with World Bank procurement guidelines and that the procurement risk could be \nconsidered average. ", "    17 \n60.  ADB and World Bank assessments of the Government\u2019s financial management systems \nand procedures undertaken in 2004 and 2005 concluded that they met ADB requirements. The \nsystems and procedures proposed for the Project were reviewed earlier in 2007, and these also \nmeet ADB requirements.31 A summary is presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n61.  A sector governance and anticorruption assessment was conducted in parallel with the \nProject\u2019s preparation, during which risks and associated mitigating actions were identified and \ndiscussed with the Government as indicated in Appendix 10. The assessment focuses on three \nthematic areas: financial management, procurement, and anticorruption. As a consequence of \nthe performance improvements that Samoa has achieved, many of the risks commonly faced in \nthe education sector in developing countries had little or no applicability. Samoa has embraced \nthe Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific of ADB and the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development, and it has subjected its procurement and financial management \nsystems to rigorous assessments that have helped the Government achieve internationally \nacceptable standards. In short, it was found that the overall likelihood of risks in each of the \ntargeted thematic areas was medium to low, and actions are being taken by the Government to \nmitigate these risks.  \n \n62.  Still, to deter corruption and increase transparency further, the Project will establish (i) a \nproject website to disclose information about project implementation and (ii) a grievance redress \nmechanism to ensure greater accountability. The former will provide updated and detailed \ninformation  on  project  implementation.  The  latter  will  be  set  up  to  receive  and  resolve \ncomplaints and to act upon stakeholders\u2019 reports of irregularities on project-related matters. \nMOF will widely publicize the existence of this mechanism. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n63.  The grant proceeds for the proposed Project will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate project \nimplementation and fund flow, an imprest account will be set up in a bank acceptable to ADB. \nThe imprest account will be managed by MOF. The initial advance to be deposited in the \naccount will not exceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures to be financed from it or 10% \nof the grant, whichever is lower. For the large contracts under the Project, direct payment \nprocedures  will  apply.  If  the  Government  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own \nresources,  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  fund  flow  and  simplify \ndocumentation processing, the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used for the \nliquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures not exceeding $50,000 per individual payment. Payments in excess of the SOE \nceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished upon full documentation.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n64.  MESC will maintain separate records and accounts for all expenditures to be financed by \nthe Project in accordance with sound accounting principles. They will specify the expenditures \nfor all activities and identify all expenditures to be financed by the Project. Project accounts, \nincluding financial statements, SOEs, and imprest account records, will be audited at the same \ntime as those of ESP II, and by the same auditor, who will be acceptable to ADB and ESP II \n                                                 \n31  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "18  \ncofinanciers AusAID and NZAID.32 The auditor\u2019s report, and copies of the certified accounts and \nrelated financial statements, including compliance with project covenants and the use of the \nimprest accounts, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after the end of \nthe fiscal year to which they relate. A separate auditor's opinion on the use of the imprest \naccount and SOE procedure will be included in the audit report.  \n \n65.  The MESC Secretariat, in collaboration with and assisted by the SchoolNet project \nmanager, will be responsible for producing regular SOE and quarterly project progress reports \non all implementation activities in conjunction with ESP II SOE and Project Performance Report. \nCopies of the reports will be forwarded by MOF to ADB and will be shared with AusAID and \nNZAID. Within 3 months after physical completion of the Project, MESC will submit to ADB a \nproject completion report in conjunction with the ESP II completion report, which will be shared \nwith AusAID and NZAID. ADB's policy on the submission of audited accounts, which covers \nfailure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by due dates, has been explained to \nthe Government. If submission of a financial statement is delayed by more than 6 months, ADB \nmay  not  approve  new  contract  awards.  If  the  delay  is  by  more  than  12  months,  grant \ndisbursements may be suspended or the grant may be canceled. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n66.   A set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating impact, outcomes, and outputs will be \ndeveloped by MESC PPRD in coordination with CMAD and SOD during Stage 1 of the Project. \nMESC will implement, monitor, and evaluate the activities and outputs of the project regularly \nand the outcomes of the Project after completion, in accordance with the schedule and terms of \nreference to be agreed upon by the Government. Performance evaluations will use qualitative \nand quantitative measures to examine and analyze the impact of project ICT interventions on \nlearning outcomes, as can be measured by standardized ICT assessment where available \n(Supplementary Appendix H).  \n \n10.  Project Review \n67.  The Government and ADB, in collaboration with AusAID and NZAID, will conduct two \nreview missions during each calendar year for the Project, with ESP II. To take advantage of \nquarterly reporting, they will be fielded shortly after the second and fourth quarters. Each review \nwill include an examination of budgetary allocations, operation and maintenance costs, staffing \nand other incremental recurrent costs, implementation arrangements, and achievements under \nthe Project. The review includes assessing progress in each component, identifying difficulties \nand constraints, and determining ways to overcome them. MESC management, specifically the \nassistant CEOs, will be a primary source of information for these reviews. In addition, the \nGovernment and ADB will jointly conduct a midterm review of the Project with ESP II. This will \n(i) review the scope, design, and project implementation arrangements; (ii) assess performance \nagainst targets and benchmarks; (iii) review lessons and experiences with implementation of \neach component; (iv) review compliance with the grant agreement; and (v) recommend any \nchanges required in project implementation. \n \n                                                 \n32  The Project should be carefully implemented to strengthen the harmonization process and avoid overburdening the \nGovernment with various reporting requirements. Therefore, procurement, disbursement, and reporting for this \nProject are aligned with the ESP II Consolidated Funding Arrangement signed by ADB, AusAID, NZAID, and the \nGovernment. ADB will assess Government procurement for further aligning with the Government\u2019s system.  ", "    19 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n68.  CMAD, SOD (21 school review officers), and the IT Unit will benefit from capacity \nbuilding and be able to develop and use e-training materials and to embed ICT in education as \na learning and teaching tool. The Project will benefit about 15,000 secondary school students \nand 800 teachers. It will also benefit secondary school teachers through the use of basic \nproductivity applications (word processing, spreadsheets, databases, graphics, presentation, \netc.) and of e-learning materials. The ability of all secondary teachers with ICT competencies \nand  skills  to  transfer  them  to  and  inspire  students  will  likely  benefit  future  generations  of \nstudents. \n \n69.  All 42 government and mission schools will have learning centers, and the surrounding \ncommunities will have access to them after school hours. Access to learning through ICT may \nwell provide the learning environment and systems necessary to encourage children to remain \nin school and stimulate rural students to acquire skills required by the curriculum and so enjoy \nmore opportunities for further education and training and become better able to perform in the \nformal labor market and/or informal income generation.  \n \n70.  Impact on Poverty and Gender. Improved access to better education and training \nthrough ICT will increase both the education and ICT skills of secondary school students. By \ntargeting all secondary schools, gains should flow into the economy of every district. Male \nparticipation and completion rates in secondary schools, a current problem, will likely improve. \nThe community access aspect of the project will provide opportunities for rural communities, \nincluding females, to learn and share experiences in overcoming poverty and improving the \nquality of life. The Project is likely to enhance the employment prospects and earnings of \nSamoans  who  emigrate  and,  as  a  consequence,  increase  remittances\u2014thereby  furthering \npoverty reduction. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n71.  The  Project  will  benefit  Samoa,  regional  neighbors,  and  development  partners  by \nproviding  the  first  comprehensive  experience  of  the  impact  of  nationwide  ICT  access  on \nsecondary  student  achievement  and  community  development.  In  addition,  the  Project  will \nprovide Internet access in all of Samoa\u2019s 22 districts, thereby lowering the costs of extending \nservices to primary schools and other institutions in the future. \n \n72.  Economic Benefits and Financial Sustainability. In Samoa, participation in secondary \neducation is a prerequisite for entry into the formal labor market. In 2000, a study found that \n93% of the private sector workforce had a secondary education. Given the size of remittances \nby Samoans working abroad, educational qualifications with computer skills will assist with \nsuccessful emigration and employment. ICT education will help geographically and financially \ndisadvantaged groups. Analysis of data developed in the quasi-experimental design will provide \na basis for assessing the impact of ICT-enhanced learning relative to its costs. Further analysis \nof returns to education may be possible through secondary analysis of household income and \nexpenditure  data  to  estimate  the  rate  of  return  to  schooling  (i.e.,  the  Mincerian  earnings \nfunction) and to assess the impact of remittances on educational attainment. \n \n73.  Appendix 12 presents a preliminary analysis of financial sustainability using the total-\ncost-of-ownership approach. The analysis concludes that incremental expenditure requirements \nfrom 2013 will be about $550,000 per annum. These estimates assume that (i) user charges will \nbe collected from after-hour usage of learning centers, (ii) a universal services fund will be \n ", "20  \nestablished, and (iii) there will be SchoolNet-related efficiency gains. The analysis does not \nmake a conclusion as to the funding for these incremental expenditures. In that connection, \nComponent 4 includes support for the preparation of a sectoral MTEF. The MTEF exercise will, \namong  other  things,  quantify  potential  ESP  II  efficiency  gains  and  revisit  the  SchoolNet \nsustainability estimates presented in Appendix 12. Preparation of the MTEF will involve the \nidentification, prioritization, and agreement of sectoral priorities and associated expenditures. \nThe satisfactory completion of a robust and agreed MTEF will be a prerequisite for moving to \nStage 2 of the project.  See Supplementary Appendix I for a detailed sustainability analysis. \n \nB.  Risks \n74.  Environment  and  Social  Safeguards.  ICT  equipment  will  be  installed  in  existing \nsecondary schools, and no additional construction will be required by the Project. The Project \nwill not finance any construction for communication towers. As such, the Project will not have \nany resettlement issues. In the event of unforeseen land acquisition and resettlement, the \nGovernment will inform ADB and prepare resettlement plans in accordance with ADB's Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The awarding of civil works contracts will be subject to ADB \nreview of resettlement plan(s). The disposal of obsolete equipment and disposables will follow \nGovernment  policies  and  guidelines  as  applicable.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government \ndevelop these policies further, as needed.  \n \n75.  Uncertain Financial Sustainability. New initiatives such as ESP II, SchoolNet, and \nother  projects  have  downstream  expenditure  implications.  These  incremental  recurrent \nexpenditures must be considered in the broader context of medium-term sectoral expenditure \npriorities. A two-stage project design will mitigate the risk that the Project may not be financially \nsustainable.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government  to  prioritize  education  expenditures, \nincluding SchoolNet-related expenditures, in an MTEF context. The Project will not move to \nStage 2 until a satisfactory sectoral sustainability analysis is prepared during Stage 1. \n \n76.  An important caveat is that, to date, MESC has made only limited progress in collecting \nand analyzing unit cost data and information on efficiency or in constructing baseline indicators \nof equity and efficiency. Nor has MESC continued work on a sustainability projection model with \nMOF. The key to sustainability for the Project, ESP II, and the sector will lie in MESC and MOF \ntaking ownership of efficiency and sustainability issues. The Project can provide resources to \nMESC to move this work forward.  \n \n77.  Lack of Managerial Capacity to Support Schools and Teachers. This may be a risk, \nbut the pilot schools are all still operating well under the leadership of school principals. The \nProject has included significant training and technical assistance to build management capacity \nin MESC staff at all levels. The project design has adopted a long-term mentoring approach to \nensure this capacity is sufficiently developed by the end of the Project. \n \n78.  Lack of Interest from the Community. Community reluctance is twofold. First, limited \nunderstanding of ICT systems can cause anxiety because of fear of ready access to unsuitable \nwebsites, of breaking the equipment, or of not have the necessary skills to use the learning \ncenters. These fears can be addressed through well-focused advocacy and training activities. \nSecond, the uncertainty of recurrent costs and the lack of technical capacity to maintain the \nsystem inhibit community interest. These can be mitigated by providing sufficient training to \nmonitor  and  manage  costs,  securing  government  and  private  sector  support  to  develop \nbusiness opportunities to recover costs, and securing a long-term maintenance agreement with \nsuppliers and/or nongovernment organizations such as the Samoan Information Technology \nSociety.  ", "    21 \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n79.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, MOF, and MESC have given \nthe following specific assurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents. \n(i)  The Government will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on \ntime.  MOF  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation \nrequests to Cabinet and MOF will ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated \nfunds during each year of project implementation to MESC. \n(ii)  Within 9 months of the effective date, MESC will create a project website to \ndisclose information about various matters on the Project, including procurement. \nWith regard to procurement, the website will include information on the list of \nparticipating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services \nprocured. \n(iii)  Within 9 months of the effective date, MESC will establish a grievance redress \nmechanism  to  resolve  complaints/grievances  or  act  upon  reports  from \nstakeholders on misuse of funds and other irregularities. A task force will (a) \nreview and address grievances of stakeholders of the Project, in relation to either \nthe Project, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying \nout any aspect of the Project; and (b) set the threshold criteria and procedures \nfor handling such grievances, for proactively and constructively responding to \nthem, and for providing the stakeholders with notice of such a mechanism. \n(iv)  Although no significant environmental impacts were identified, the operation of \nschool facilities and the disposal of obsolete equipment undertaken under the \nProject will be implemented in line with the Government\u2019s environmental laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).  \n(v)  The Government and MESC will ensure that construction of new school facilities, \nincluding construction of communication towers, will be carried out at existing \nschools or MECS land. In the event no sufficient existing land is available and \nnew land acquisition might be needed, the Government will inform ADB and \nprepare  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement (1995). The Government will ensure that (a) resettlement plans will \nbe prepared in consultation with affected people and disclosed to affected people \nprior to forwarding to ADB for approval, and (b) ADB review and approval of the \nresettlement plans will be a condition for award of civil work contracts. \n(vi)  The Project will be implemented in two stages. The Government and MESC will \nensure all activities prescribed under Stage 1, including the requirement for an \nagreed financial sustainability analysis for the Project as part of the MTEF, will be \nsuccessfully completed before implementation of Stage 2.  \n(vii)  The Government and MESC will ensure that each of the participating schools \nthat will receive the learning center package will not increase its school fees or \nimpose additional fees for the use of ICT. In the event an increase is required, \nthe participating schools shall obtain approval from MESC, in consultation with \nADB. \n(viii)  Within 12 months of the effective date, the Government will prepare and submit a \nreport satisfactory to ADB that includes: (a) six academic subjects identified for \nsupport under the Project and schools assigned to the three implementation \ngroups that correspond to phases in Stage 2 based on the agreed criteria, (b) \nbaseline data for ICT competencies of students, teachers and MESC staff, and \n ", "22  \n(c) projections of the financial sustainability of the education sector, including the \nrecurrent cost implications of EPS II and the Project. \n(ix)  Within 18 months of the effective date the Government will have SchoolNet \nmanagement sub-committees officially established and operational in all mission \nand secondary schools\u2019 management committee.  \n(x)  The  Government  and  MESC  will  ensure  that  the  ICT  training,  including  the \nminimum ICT competency training, is made mandatory for the teachers to ensure \nthat the teachers have the minimum ICT competencies.  \n(xi)  The Government and MESC will ensure that at least two staff shall be recruited \nor appointed to the MESC IT Unit. The staff will receive training to manage the \nexpanded  network  of  schools  and  provide  IT  support  services  to  all  Project \nschools. Furthermore, MESC will appoint at least two teachers in each school \nand ensure that they undergo the training for SchoolNet administrators. \n(xii)  Within 12 months of the Effective Date, the Government and MESC will develop \na plan and policies for the universal service fund, acceptable to ADB, to ensure \nthat  surplus  capacity  and  budgetary  resources  are  made  available  to  the \neducation sector in order to provide an affordable education network and MESC \nshall promptly implement the plan. \n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that the Project accounts, financial statements, SOE \nand Imprest Account will be audited at the same time as the audit for ESP II and \nby the same auditor engaged for ESP II. The appointed auditor will be acceptable \nto ADB, AusAID and NZAID. \n(xiv)  The Government and MESC will ensure that all necessary reports, including the \nquarterly reports and the annual reports are prepared in conjunction with ESP II. \nThe Government will submit the reports to ADB and the reports will be shared \nAusAID and NZAID. \nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness \n80.  Prior to grant effectiveness, the Government will have issued a decree or an order that \nstipulates that the existing Steering Committee for ESP II will also be the Steering Committee \nfor the Project.  \n \nC.  Conditions for Withdrawals  \n81.  No withdrawals shall be made from the Grant Account until, \n(i)  The  Government  has  appointed  the  Project  Manager  in  accordance  with \nparagraph 52 of this document; and \n  (ii)  The  Government  has  established  the  Technical  Advisory  Committee  in \naccordance with paragraph 52 of this document. \n \n ", "    23 \nVI.

Overview.  Samoa  is  an  independent  Pacific  island  country  with  a  small  but  open \neconomy. While the economy continues to rely heavily on external assistance in the form of \ngrants  and  soft  loans,  the  cost  of  servicing  external  debt  has  been  declining  steadily, \ndecreasing by 11% between fiscal year (FY) 2004 and FY2005. Lack of opportunity and income \nvulnerability, often exacerbated by external economic shocks and natural disasters, contribute \nto hardship in rural areas, particularly on the island of Savai\u2019i. Despite vulnerability to external \nshocks, Samoa has experienced stability and sustained economic growth over the past decade. \nThe gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 4%, on average, annually between 1993 and \n2007. Poverty is not regarded as a problem; private remittances from the 35% of the population \nliving abroad are substantial (17% of gross national income). External aid represented 11.5% of \ngross national income in 2005. The 1999 Pacific Human Development Report ranked Samoa \n7th among 15 developing island economies in the region, while it was ranked 75th globally in \nthe latest 2006 Human Development Report.1 The Strategy for the Development of Samoa for \n2005\u20132007 was completed in January 2005 and includes a commitment to restrain the annual \noverall budget deficit to no more than 3.5% of GDP and to hold annual inflation rates to less \nthan 3.0%. \n \n2.  Education is a priority area of the Government. The second long-term Strategic Policies \nand Plan July 2006\u2013June 2015 of the Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture\u2019s (MESC) \nstresses  equity,  quality,  relevance,  efficiency,  and  sustainability  as  central  objectives.  The \nsector has shown significant achievements including an adult literacy rate of 98.7%, the highest \nin the region. Despite many positive achievements, the quality and efficiency of education \nremain disappointing. Variations in student\u2019s learning achievement and opportunities to learn \nremain significant, particularly between urban and rural areas. More than 25% of the students \nenrolling in primary education do not complete the 8-year program. In 2006, the dropout rate \nwas 7% for grades 1\u20132, 5% for grade 8, 18% for grades 10\u201311, 3% for grade 12, and as high \nas 41% for grade 13. Repetition rates at grades 1, 8, 11, 12, and 13 are high and largely  \nunchanged since 1997. In 2006, 88% of primary students progressed to the lower secondary \nlevel and 91% progressed to the upper secondary level, but only 53% of 12th graders advance \nto grade 13. \n \n3.  The education system in Samoa consists of 8 years of compulsory primary education, 5 \nyears of secondary education, and 4 years of higher education. National examinations are held \nat three levels in primary (years 4, 6, and 8) and year 12 in secondary. For year 13, a regional \nexamination determines access to the first year of university. MESC is responsible for policy \nformulation, guidance, and supervision of all government schools and institutions. The chief \nexecutive  officer,  with  assistance  from  heads  of  the  eight  divisions  and  the  Information \nTechnology (IT) Unit, manages the daily operation of MESC. Significant efforts have been made \nto strengthen institutional and management capacity. Despite major undertakings, weaknesses \nremain, hampering efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of education service \ndelivery. Village committees run most primary and secondary schools and are responsible for \nsetting,  collecting,  and  spending  school  fees;  constructing  and  maintaining  buildings;  and \nproviding consumables. The Government funds teachers\u2019 salaries, some consumables, and \ninitial sets of textbooks every 5 years for primary schools.  \n \n                                                 \n1  United Nation Development Programme (UNDP). 1999.

Secondary education should provide 5 years of education (years 9\u201313). However, not all \nsecondary schools are able to offer the full year 13 curriculum for lack of teachers and other \nresources (e.g., tools for applied subjects). In 2006, about 40% of year 12 students did not enter \nyear 13. In 2006, There are 44 secondary schools in Samoa, with a total enrollment of 15,165, \nand enrollment in the 42 government and mission schools was 14, 871. In 2005, the gross \nenrollment rate at the secondary level was 80%.2 In 2006, the overall participation rate for \nsecondary students (age 15\u201319) was only 45%. Student distribution in the country shows that \n46% of secondary students are in the Apia urban area, 29% on the rest of Upolu, and 25% in \nSavai\u2019i. There are 799 teachers in government and mission secondary schools. The Apia urban \narea has 45% of secondary teachers, the rest of Upolu has 28.5% secondary teachers, and \nSavai\u2019i has 26.5% of secondary teachers. There is at least one government secondary school in \neach of Samoa\u2019s 22 districts. Males are underrepresented at the secondary level, constituting \nless  than  40%  of  year  13  enrollments.  Secondary  students  receive  the  Samoa  School \nCertificate after completing the national examination for year 12. A regional examination, the \nPacific Senior Secondary Certificate administered by the South Pacific Board of Educational \nAssessment is taken upon completion of year 13 and is required for enrollment in tertiary \neducation.  \n \n5.  The status of the school curriculum in Samoa is problematic; revisions made through \npiecemeal interventions by donor agencies have resulted in poor articulation between grade \nlevels and across subjects. Also absent are clear guidelines of expected learning outcomes that \nset out the literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills, as well as social and cultural skills, \nthat children should master as they progress through school system. Improvements required \ninclude (i) an updated comprehensive (K\u201312) curriculum policy framework; (ii) subject and year-\nlevel syllabi statements; (iii) classroom activities that emphasize more active, student-centered \nlearning activities; and (iv) strengthened pedagogical and discipline knowledge teaching skills \nand the range of classroom assessment techniques that are essential for high-quality teaching \nand learning. These issues have implications for quality and efficiency at both the primary and \nsecondary level. The Government intends to develop an integrated curriculum for primary years \n1\u20133  and  subject-specific  curricula  in  seven  subject  areas  for  years  4\u20138,  providing  easy \narticulation with the secondary curriculum. A secondary education curriculum framework for \nyears 9\u201313 is being translated into subject syllabi and implemented. There is a need to provide \nteachers\u2019 manuals, textbooks, and learning materials,  and to design and deliver in-service \ntraining programs, for the secondary level. More effective instructional practice will also have to \ninclude more effective use of formative and summative assessments. Modern assessment \nstrategies  have  been  introduced  in  recent  curriculum  projects  supported  by  development \npartners. These are, however, not yet widely applied.  \n \n6.  Access  and  Equity.  Generally,  children  throughout  Samoa  have  good  access  to \nprimary  education  and  limited  access  to  secondary.  Over  25%  of  primary  entrants  fail  to \ncomplete grade 8; of those who do complete, 90% have access to secondary. Therefore, about \none in three primary entrants does not have access to secondary education. There is an urgent \nneed to support the development of realistic equity indicators and the collection of baseline data \nthat will guide policy reforms to increase equitable access to secondary education. Every village \nhas a primary school; clusters of villages make up districts, and each district has a secondary \nschool, with the bigger districts having more than one. The country is divided into 22 districts, \nwith 8 on Savai\u2019i and 14 on Upolu, including three districts in the Apia urban area. Districts \noutside of the Apia urban area are considered rural. Recent community consultations identified \n                                                 \n2  World Bank, EdStat, www1.worldbank.org/education/edstats. MESC Statistical Digest for 2006 does not provide \ngross and net enrollment rates for either primary or secondary schools. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nthe  condition  of  school  facilities  as  an  important  source  of  dissatisfaction.  Although  many \nprimary schools and some secondary schools have been upgraded in recent years, several \nschools in the poorer areas still operate in facilities that do not meet national standards, often \nwithout proper classrooms and necessary equipment. Substandard schools, particularly in the \nrural areas, convey an image of poor-quality service, create an apathetic teaching and learning \nenvironment, can inhibit student learning, and result in a high dropout rate. A World Bank study \nsuggests  that  the  likelihood  of  children  from  the  lowest  quintile  of  households  reaching \nsecondary education and finding a job is low. Poor parents have difficulty paying school fees, \nespecially at the secondary level. Thus, children of poor families perform less well in school and \noften dropout early. The provision of ICT equipment will have beneficial impact on equity by \nequalizing access to in-service teacher training and access to learning resources in remote \nsecondary schools. However, ensuring systemwide efficiency will require the development of \nsystemwide equity measures, including benefit incidence analysis, which will lead to more \nequitable resource allocation geared to inclusive growth and poverty alleviation. Such analysis \nis incorporated in the Project design.  \n \n7.  Quality and Efficiency. The quality of education, as measured by test results and \nfunctional literacy, is disappointing. The Samoa primary education literacy level one (year 4) \nand two (year 6) tests, which assess students\u2019 risk of not reaching literacy and numeracy \nstandards, as well as year 8 examinations, indicate unsatisfactory results. For example, in year \n4, students at risk in English increased from 29% in 1997 to 51% in 2003; in year 6, students at \nrisk in numeracy increased from 63% in 1997 to 71% in 2003. In year 8, raw scores in all five \nsubject areas tested declined. At the secondary level, scores on the year 12 examination in the \n15 subject areas declined over the 5 years between 1997 and 2002. Though they increased in \nmost subjects in 2004, they remain low. In the 2005 Samoa School Certificate examination, the \naverage grade in core subjects was 31% in mathematics, 37% in English, 22% in geography, \nand 53% in agricultural science and general science. Although questions may be asked about \nthe reliability, validity, and suitability of these tests to accurately measure changes in student \nperformance over time, fundamental problems are affecting school education in Samoa. These \ninclude low capacity to provide high-quality learning opportunities, resources, and learning \nenvironments  in  government  schools,  or  to  ensure  they  are  available  to  all  students\u2014\nparticularly in rural areas\u2014and are delivered efficiently. In addition, many primary students do \nnot complete the 8-year program. Dropout and repetition rates are high, indicating inefficiency in \nthe school system. Graduates have low levels of functional literacy and numeracy and almost \nno computer literacy. Past efforts to address these issues of quality and efficiency, such as the \nEducation Sector Project I, have not been particularly effective in addressing inefficiency in the \nsystem. MESC will need additional support in improving efficiency and equity, and this need is \nreflected in the Project design. \n \n8.  Relevance. The education system serves two labor markets\u2014one internal and one \nexternal.  The  internal  labor  market  focuses  on  agriculture,  fisheries,  construction  and \ntransportation, and small businesses (wholesale and retail). The manufacturing and services \nsectors (especially tourism) have been growing recently. Yet, few formal wage-paying positions \nare available in the country for highly trained technicians or skilled workers. As a result, 35.4% \nof Samoans live and work overseas. No comprehensive data exist on the occupations of \noverseas Samoans or information on the adequacy of the education system in preparing them \nfor work abroad. Remittances from overseas Samoans are substantial, representing 17.4% of \nnational income.  \n \n9.  Management. An important management challenge is to increase the effectiveness of \nexternal aid to the education sector. The short-term focus of projects, overlap and duplication of \n ", "  Appendix 2           31     \nobjectives  and  investments,  fragmentation  of  effort,  and  multiple  planning  and  reporting \nrequirements weaken the overall impact of aid. Through the Education Sector Project II (ESP II) \nthe Government has taken the lead in addressing this issue, and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), and New Zealand Agency \nfor  International  Development  (NZAID)  have  formally  agreed  on  arrangements  for  aligning \nagency objectives and Government priorities and harmonizing procedures and processes for a \nsectorwide  approach  (SWAp),  including  joint  reviews  and  cofinancing.  However,  some \ndevelopment assistance to education remains outside the ESP II framework. \n \n10.  Efforts  in  Addressing  Access,  Equity,  Quality,  Efficiency,  and  Relevance.  To \naddress these issues in the sector, the Government has undertaken ESP II, a broad, $30 million \nproject, with support from ADB, AusAID, and NZAID using a SWAp. ESP II is scheduled to run \nthrough 31 December 2012. The project has five components: (i) introducing curriculum reform \nand  assessment  systems;  (ii) developing  effective  teachers;  (iii) improving  access  to  high-\nquality education; (iv) strengthening capacity to undertake research, evaluation, policy analysis, \nand planning; and (v) strengthening capacity to implement and manage development projects. \nThe Project is designed to establish a learning environment that provides all children with an \nequal opportunity to learn at a higher level, while improving the cost-effectiveness of service \nprovision. ESP II will contribute to eliminating inequity by minimizing regional disparities in \naccess  to  high-quality  education,  promoting  equitable  learning  outcomes,  and  improving \nefficiency.  Improving  access  to  high-quality  primary  and  secondary  education  in  poor \ncommunities is expected to reduce poverty and hardship.  \n \n11.  The SchoolNet and Community Access Project (the Project) complement ESP II in three \nhigh-priority areas. First, ESP II gives limited emphasis to the use of ICT as a tool to enhance \nstudent learning outcomes and managing the education system; the Project fills that ICT void. \nSecond,  the  major  focus  of  ESP  II  is  on  improving  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  primary \neducation and rehabilitating government secondary schools; the Project will complement that \nintervention  by  targeting  the  secondary  level  to  provide  e-learning  and  e-management \nopportunities and thereby contribute to sectorwide efficiency. Third, while ESP II does include a \ncomponent to strengthen capacity in research, evaluation, policy analysis, and planning, there \nhave been deficiencies in the area of financial planning and sustainability projections that \nwarrant additional support. Moreover, the quasi-experimental design of the SchoolNet Project \nwill require specialized assistance in strengthening evaluation capacity. The Project will be \nlinked with ESP II to complement activities under it, and will be implemented within the ESP II \nstructure  to  address  these  issues.  MESC\u2019s  capacity  will  be  strengthened  to  implement \nadditional activities under the Project.  \n \n12.  ICT can significantly help to develop public awareness of the long-term benefits of a \nsound basic education and recognition that other people in different countries have used ICT to \nimprove their quality of life.3 The capacity to effectively embed ICT in the teaching and learning \nprocess  has  seen  significant  improvement  in  the  quality  of  teachers,  and  subsequently  in \nstudent learning outcomes, in many countries. Such skills are not only useful in basic education \nbut also essential for life-long learning and employability.4  \n \n                                                 \n3  See the quality-of-life changes initiated and supported by the Uganda Schoolnet project for local communities and \nschool children, Uganda SchoolNet, World Links/MOE,  http://www.geocities.com/schoolnetuganda. \n4  See  ICT  Test  Bed:  2006  Annual  Report  at  www.evaluation.icttestbed.org.uk/reports  and  \nwww.unescobkk.org/education/ict. \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \n13.  International evidence indicates the importance of ICT capacity and skills as key factors \nfor national and global economic development. The Government is committed to introducing \nICT in the education system. The project provides an opportunity for MESC to meet its ICT \nobjectives, building on lessons learned in the ADB-funded SchoolNet pilot. Samoa will be the \nfirst Pacific developing member country to provide universal access to ICT-based instruction \nand Internet access to secondary schools. The design of the project will provide important \ninformation on the costs of ICT and its effectiveness in enhancing student achievement and \nemployment prospects. It is anticipated that the Samoa experience will be of great value to \nother countries in the region and to the development community for further developing ICT \nstrategies. The issue of ICT literacy is of particular importance in Samoa, with its large overseas \npopulation dependence on remittances as indicated above. \n \n14.  Economic  Rationale.  Internationally,  the  economic  rationale  for  public  sector \ninvolvement  in  the  finance  and  provision  of  education,  especially  basic  and  secondary \neducation, is well-established and applies to Samoa. International research has demonstrated \nthe high social rate of return to basic education. As of 2001, approximately 50,000 people were \nin the formal workforce in Samoa, accounting for 25% of the total workforce. Those employed in \nthe private sector and receiving higher average incomes also report higher levels of secondary \neducation (93%), with 21% of them reporting postsecondary qualifications. Workers in the \ninformal sector have lower educational attainment, as only 61% have a secondary education \nand 15% tertiary. The Government sees investment in human capital as imperative for growth. \nThe Samoan education system is a combination of public, religious, and private providers. Most \nGovernment schools have a high degree of community participation in school management. \nMost primary schools and all but four secondary schools are viewed as the property of the \ncommunity, with the Government providing teachers. The Project will build upon the principles \nof public-private partnership, strengthen delivery, and improve the quality and efficiency of \nsecondary schools. Through support for policy analysis and policy dialogue, the Project will \nassist the Government in evaluating cost-recovery alternatives for postsecondary education \nand, in this way, improve the economic efficiency and viability of the system. \n \n15.  Finance and Sustainability. Education is consistently the largest single item in the \nnational budget, accounting in the past 5 years for between 16% and 19% of expenditures. \nExternal assistance through grants targeting specific programs is provided by a number of \ndonors.  Currently,  ADB  is  the  only  lending  agency.  Parental  contributions  to  primary  and \nsecondary  education  through  fees  is  minimal.  Fees  are  determined  by  individual  school \ncommittees. Generally the income is sufficient to pay only for basic utilities.  \n \n16.  Indicators point to financial stress in the education system despite the high level of \ngovernment support and substantial international development assistance. This is particularly \nthe case in the recurrent budget and in support to basic education. Analysis of expenditure data \ncombined with estimates of inflation suggest that per-student expenditure at the primary level \ndecreased by over 15% in the past 4 years. There is an identified need to assess the efficiency \nof  the  system  and  to  implement  policies  and  strategies  to  lower  unit  costs  in  high-cost \ninstitutions and subsectors. \n \n17.  The ongoing ESP II addresses nonsalary recurrent inputs in the short to medium term \nthat will help MESC and the Ministry of Finance offset the increased recurrent and operating \ncosts of schools. The Government needs to develop a detailed financial framework to indicate \nthe  overall  budgetary  requirement  to  implement  the  SSP,  including  clearly  defined \nresponsibilities  and  accountability  procedures  for  school  maintenance.  Many  communities, \nespecially rural and low-income areas, are not able to provide sufficient funds or manage \n ", "  Appendix 2           33     \npreventative maintenance plans. MESC recently established its Assets Management Division to \nhelp  communities  plan  and  manage  school  maintenance.  The  Government  is  considering \nadopting a policy to include school maintenance cost as a budgetary line item. An important \nissue concerns the very high level of salary expenditure in the recurrent budget. At about 90%, \nit is well above that of most countries (with the exception of other Pacific island countries). Very \nfew resources are left for other operational expenditures. This is a concern in view of the need \nto  raise  the  morale  of  teachers  and  the  need  for  new  teachers.  The  inability  of  many \ncommunities, especially in rural areas, to provide sufficient funds for school maintenance is \nanother concern.  \n \n18.  As the education sector is already a primary recipient of government budgetary support, \nthere may be limited opportunity for increasing overall government expenditure on education. \nThe  only  likely  opportunities  for  generating  additional  resources  may  be  improvements  in \nefficiency and private-public partnerships. Donor coordination can also contribute to increased \nefficiency in the sector, and coordination has improved in recent years.  \n ", "34  Appendix 3   \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR IN ICTa \n \nFunding Source       \nSubsector  Duration  Amount and Description \nADB   Primary and  2000\u20132006  Grant of $820,000 for facilities, training, \nSecondary     and materials.

Introduction \n1.  The  local  project  management  team  under  the  Education  Sector  Project  II \n(ESP II)  secretariat  will  provide  day-to-day  project  management  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment to the SchoolNet and Community Access Project (the Project). This team \nwill  principally  comprise  the  ESP  II  coordinator;  Ministry  of  Education,  Sports,  and \nCulture (MESC) division and unit heads; and SchoolNet project manager, with support \nstaff. The ESP II secretariat will provide similar project management for the ESP II \nproject. \nB.  Scope of Work \n2.  The consulting team will support the local project management team across all \naspects of the Project\u2014in planning, reporting, and other management and consultative \nprocesses; school selection; equipment procurement and commissioning; training and \norientation at the school, ministry, and community level; ministry management systems \nand procedures; e-learning material access and/or development and dissemination; and \npolicy and partnership development. The consulting team will need to be able to adapt to \nthe developing technical situation and needs and be able to support the integrated \nsectorwide approach. \n3.  The Project provides for one contract with a firm to provide all the consulting \nservices except the \n(i)  position of project management adviser and \n(ii)  unallocated  person-months,  2  international  and  8  national,  for  which \nindividual consultants will be recruited. \n \n4.  The  project  management  adviser  will  be  recruited  to  support  the  ESP  II \nsecretariat and the SchoolNet project manager in the overall management of the Project. \nThis position needs to be taken up as early as possible, and the consultant will work \ndirectly with the management team for the Project. In this way, the position needs to be \nindependent  from  the  main  consulting  team.  The  unallocated  person-months  are \nprovided to cover additional or unforeseen requirements that may arise from time to \ntime, based on the progress of the Project and the changing requirements, related for \nexample to information and communications technology (ICT) needs. In this case, the \nGovernment will need to direct recruitment on a case-by-case basis. \n5.  The  integrated  nature  of  the  Project  and  the  consulting  services  makes  it \nimportant that consulting services (except for the two items noted above) be provided by \none firm rather than split among a number of firms and contracts, so that consulting \nservices do not become fragmented and end up creating management issues. The team \nleader of the consulting team will have overall responsibility for coordinating the various \ninputs in coordination with, and reporting to, the ESP II Secretariat, through the ESP II \ncoordinator.  \n6.  Given the complexities of the Project and the demands of the ongoing ESP II, it \nwill be important for the project management adviser and the consulting team (principally \nthe team leader, or the deputy team leader in the absence of the team leader) to fully \nsupport the local project management team in all aspects of the Project. \n ", "                Appendix 9  51 \n     \n7.

POVERTY ANALixYSIS AND STRATEGY \n 9\nA. Linkages to the Country Partnership Strategy    \n \nThe Government\u2019s education policies and strategies for 1995\u20132005 focus on major education reforms, and a number of \nactivities have successfully been completed. Enrollment rates in Samoa are very impressive compared with those of other \nPacific countries. Still, the gains have not been equally shared. Poor students drop out without acquiring useful skills. The \nProject will address the gaps in the education sector by providing e-learning facilities and materials, strengthening pre- and in-\nservice teacher training programs, and improving the examination and assessment system in all 22 districts in the country. The \nProject will address the efficiency of learning systems and the capacity of teachers to provide modern teaching methods using \ninformation and communication technologies (ICT) in a manner that will increase the relevance of education to children and \ncontribute to reduced dropout rates and increased achievements both at school and in future employment. \n \nB. Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  Targeted intervention \n1. Key Issues  \nUnemployment and the lack of appropriate schooling are cited as two major causes of hardship among youths. An emerging \ntrend of increased dropout rates among youths in both rural and urban areas is perceived, leaving an increasing number of \nyouths unemployed and with little prospect of securing good jobs. In rural areas, the migration of the young to urban areas has \nleft large tracts of plantation lands idle. Rural children generally have relatively limited access to secondary education. Only 22% \nof the population is concentrated in urban Apia, and almost half (48%) of the population lives in predominantly rural areas \n(northwest Upolu and Savai\u2019i).1 Eighteen of the 42 secondary schools are in Apia and eight in northwest Upolu. Schools in Apia \nare considered to be much better than in other areas. Demand for schooling in Apia is therefore high, and as a result schools \nthere are relatively large. Schools in rural areas often operate in low-quality facilities and with few learning inputs. Considerable \ninequity therefore exists in access to secondary education. The emerging pattern is dissatisfaction in communities with poor \nhealth facilities and services, which describes the state of most school facilities on Upolu. The lack of market opportunities for \nagricultural produce and communication infrastructure were the primary sources of dissatisfaction for communities consulted in \nSavai\u2019i. Overall, the perceived lack of infrastructure and services and/or their poor quality have significantly contributed to \nhardship. Lack of commitment to customer service by government departments was perceived to be a primary reason for the \nnondelivery and/or deterioration in the quality of needed services and existing facilities. Consultations identified the following \ncommunity priorities to address causes of hardship in society: (i) reducing the cost of living, (ii) making loan assistance \naccessible, (iii) supporting agricultural development, (iv) providing services and infrastructure especially for education, and \n(v) making housing assistance accessible. In addition, the following capacity-building needs were identified to strengthen \ncommunity efforts in addressing hardship in the community: (i) business skills, (ii) cattle-farming skills, (iii) fund raising, (iv) safe \ndrinking water, (v) school improvement activities, (vi) nutrition education, (vii) road maintenance, (viii) computer literacy, and (ix) \nmanagement skills for village councils.  \n \n2. Design Features \nThe Project will improve the quality of secondary education by improving access to technology and e-learning materials with \nbetter classrooms, facilities, equipment, and trained teachers. The Project will also provide communities with access to \nSchoolNet learning centers for use as life-long learning tools and for other business. The Project will benefit children from rural \nand economically disadvantaged households in all 22 districts in the country. Students and communities will benefit from \nadvanced learning and knowledge-sharing opportunities, as well as from improved potential for employment. Teachers will \nbenefit  from  improved  teaching  resources  and  capabilities,  which  will  benefit  children  from  rural  and  economically \ndisadvantaged households. The monitoring and evaluation built into the project design will ensure that project funding and \nresources are in fact transferred to secondary schools in all the districts to ensure equitable learning outcomes for all.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Abbott, D. 2002.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nVariations in student\u2019s learning achievement and opportunities for learning remain significant, particularly between urban and \nrural areas. Dropout rates are high, as are repetition rates, and have not changed markedly since 1997. Poor families are \nadversely impacted by the low performance. Samoan school children and teachers outside of Apia are physically isolated \nfrom those in the capital and have limited access to good teaching resources, library facilities, and alternative knowledge \nsources. This lack of high-quality teaching and learning materials has implications for equitable learning outcomes and will be \naddressed by the Project. \n \nCommunication and access to information is limited for rural communities, contributing to isolation and lost opportunities. The \nisolation of communities, limited availability of ICT facilities, and lack of sufficient skills in using ICT hinder access to \nknowledge and skills that can help communities improve their ability to seek national and global information on employment, \nopen up new opportunities, and maintain and improve their environment to lead healthier and more productive lives. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nThe project is designed for broad stakeholder participation, including key national, district, and village policymakers, as well as \non extensive pilot activities under the SchoolNet pilot project. Focus group meetings and workshops were conducted with \ndifferent education and training agencies, local leaders, civil society, communities, and nongovernment organizations. \nBesides  workshops  to  discuss  the  issues,  timely  consultations  with  government  staff  were  held  during  the  technical \nassistance. School teachers, principals, parents, and students were consulted during technical assistance implementation. \nThe timing, venue, and method of organizing public consultations were arranged so that disadvantaged groups could attend \nand have a chance to speak out. Special attention was paid to consultations with local people about the selection of school \nsites and of beneficiaries.  \n \nThe full participation of project beneficiaries and stakeholders started with the feasibility stage and will continue throughout \nproject implementation, monitoring, and evaluation with planning in the Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture; school level \nbusiness planning; and highly participative training programs. The Project takes a participatory approach, with community \nawareness programs and consultative workshops. The rapid evolution of new technology will be taken into account and \nimplementation adjusted accordingly. Partnership arrangements with communities and the information technology private \nsector  will  ensure  long-term  community  participation.  The  Project  will  complement  Education  Sector  Project  II  (ESP \nII) activities and will contribute to the achievement of ESP II outcomes. \n \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nGender inequity is not a major issue in Samoa, especially with regard to education opportunities. Recent studies on gender \nand ICT have proven that ICT can provide rural people with information related to their business, reduce the costs of \nremittances, and put microfinance within the reach of poor men and women. The design includes activities to empower \nwomen at the community level to avail themselves of the benefits of ICT. The project design ensures the full participation of \nwomen and vulnerable groups at all stages of the Project, including in community awareness and consultative workshop \nprograms. The inclusion of e-centers and capacity development at the community level will help women to access and benefit \nfrom increased awareness, knowledge, and use of ICT in daily life and in operating their businesses.  \n \n2.

Introduction \n \n1.  The ADB grant and committed counterpart funds will finance investment costs and \nrecurrent expenditures of the SchoolNet and Community Access Project (the Project) until 2012. \nAdditional  expenditures  will  be  incurred  beyond  2012  for  hardware  replacement,  software \nupgrades, maintenance, and other recurrent costs, including licenses, connectivity fees, utilities, \nand consumables. This appendix identifies incremental expenditures and presents a preliminary \nanalysis of project financial sustainability. The Project will help the Ministry of Education, Sports, \nand Culture (MESC) to develop a medium-term expenditure framework for the entire sector \nduring Stage 1 of the Project as a precondition for proceeding to Stage 2. Supplementary \nAppendix I presents further details. \n \nB.   Incremental Funding Implications \n \n2.  Table A11 presents the total cost-of-ownership analysis, which estimates annualized \nincremental expenditures. Quantifiable savings and revenues are also estimated for (i) user fees \nfor after-school activities in the Community Action Program (CAP), (ii) contributions from a \nuniversal  services  fund,  and/or  (iii)  efficiency  gains  through  the  use  of  information  and \ncommunication technologies (ICT) in instruction in small and remote schools. The analysis \nconcludes that incremental expenditure requirements from 2013 will be about $550,000 per \nannum. \n \nTable A11: Annualized Incremental SchoolNet Funding Requirements (2013\u2013)  \n($ \u2018000) \nItem  Amounta\nA.

Options for Financing Incremental Expenditures \n \n3.  The analysis has considered three options for meeting incremental SchoolNet funding \nrequirements for 2013 and beyond. Option 1 would be continued reliance on external donor \nassistance  for  an  indefinite  period  into  the  future.  Development  partners  have  indicated  a \nwillingness, in principle, to commit to long-term support, but this option has been rejected as \ninconsistent with the principle of sustainability. \n \n4.  Option 2 would be to fund the incremental expenditures through an overall increase to \nthe  education  budget.  Samoa  has  experienced  an  average  annual  growth  of  real  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) of about 4% over the period 1993\u20132007, which translates into an \nincrease of about 20% over this period. Samoa already has a relatively high level of education \nspending, so further increases are not encouraged. For this reason, this option has also been \nrejected.  \n \n5.  Option 3 would be to provide additional funding from the fiscal space created by ESP II \nresource  reallocations  (within  existing  baselines)  and  service-delivery  improvements.  In \nexamining  sustainability  risks,  ESP  II  states  that  \u201cthe  development  of  a  sector  policy  and \nfinancing framework with sustainable operation and maintenance costs\u2014supported by ADB and \nother  development  partners  under  the  Education,  Policy  and  Strategic  Plan  (EPSP)\u2014will \naddress this risk.\u201d1  \n \n6.  ESP II emphasizes strengthening capacity for policy analysis and planning in MESC to \nimprove efficiency. As noted in the ESP II report and recommendation of the President (para. \n41) MESC operates \u201cin an environment of increasingly constrained resources, which makes \nimprovements in the efficiency in service delivery imperative.\u201d It is anticipated that a range of \nefficiency  gains  will  be  possible  through  rationalizing  small  schools,  multi-grade  teaching, \nimproving teacher preparation, better teaching and learning materials, and improving internal \nefficiency of schooling.  \n \n7.  It is anticipated that the Government\u2019s strategy for improving efficiency will be included in \nthe MECS Strategic Plan as a specific assurance in the ADB loan agreement: \u201cWithin 12 \nmonths of loan effectiveness, the Government will (i) develop an evidence based Education, \nSports and Culture Policy and Strategic Plan (2006-2014) for the education sector \u2026 (ii) provide \na copy of such strategic plan to ADB, AusAID, NZAID,  and other relevant development partners \nfor review and comments prior to tabling such plan for cabinet approval; (iii) consider comments \nfrom ADB, AusAID, and NZAID prior to tabling such policy and plan for approval; and (iv) table it \nfor cabinet approval.\u201d   \n \nC.   Conclusion \n \n8.  SchoolNet-related incremental expenditures for years 2013 and beyond will be financed \nby resource reallocations and savings realized through efficiency gains. The SchoolNet Project \nincludes  additional  resources  to  help  the  Government  develop  a  comprehensive  financing \nframework,  medium-term  expenditure  framework  for  the  sector,  and  multi-year  projection \nmodels of financial sustainability. Successful completion of these activities during Stage 1 will \ndemonstrate  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project  and  constitute  a  pre-condition  for \nproceeding to Stage 2. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.
