INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) formally announced the Asian Bond \nMarkets Initiative (ABMI) in 2003 to boost the development of local currency bond markets. \nABMI was intended to address the \u201cdouble mismatch problem\u201d\u2014heavy dependence on external \nshort-term foreign currency funding to finance long-term domestic investments\u2014which led to the \nAsian currency crisis in 1997\u20131998. ABMI also aims to channel savings within the region toward \nlong-term investment. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has served as ABMI\u2019s secretariat \nsince inception as a part of its strategy to support greater financial, fiscal, and macroeconomic \nstability in the region. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \n2.   The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  supports  ABMI\u2019s  Cross-border \nSettlement Infrastructure  Forum  (CSIF),  which  aims  to  create  system  linkages  among key \nmarket settlement infrastructures in the region. The linkages will facilitate intra-regional portfolio \ninvestment and also contribute to financial stability as a new regional safety net. The linkages \nwill  support  the  efficient  utilization  of  local  currency  bonds  as  collateral  regionally,  and \nconsequently increase local currency liquidity when the region faces market stress. The TA is \nbased on the endorsement of ASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   The region\u2019s local currency bond markets have expanded since the Asian currency \ncrisis. They are still modest in size, but aggregated outstanding local currency bonds in ASEAN \nplus the PRC and the Republic of Korea had risen from $1.349 trillion at the end of 2003 to \n$10.033 trillion at the end of June 2016, making it now comparable to the size of Japan\u2019s bond \nmarket. The region was able to weather the global financial crisis in 2007\u20132008 thanks to the \nbond markets functioning as a spare tire2 for the stressed banking sector. However, the taper \ntantrum3 in May 2013 exacerbated concerns over a capital flow reversal if United States (US) \ninterest rates rose. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), investor behavior varies \nby region and could lead to herd behavior4. Another IMF report showed that foreign banks\u2019 local \ncurrency lending is less sensitive to global shocks than cross-border lending, which is normally \nUS dollar-denominated5. These reports suggest that herd behavior in international markets has \nlittle effect on local currency bond markets. ASEAN+3 would be less vulnerable to global shocks \nif its financial markets were more integrated and more funds were recycled within the region. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 April 2016. \n2  Various evidence after the global financial crisis shows that local currency bond market can play an important role \nin diversifying the financial system and mitigating the impact of financial crises on the real economy. \u201cIn Asia, local \nbond markets served as a \u201cspare tire\u201d when other financing channels (e.g., bank and equity) were impaired at the \nonset of the global financial crisis, thus mitigating its impact.\u201d IMF, the World Bank, the EBRD, and the OECD. \n2013. Local Currency Bond Markets- a Diagnostic Framework. Washington. DC.  \n3  Taper tantrum is the term used to for the market turbulence in 2013 when the reduction of the Federal Reserve's \nquantitative easing was considered.  \n4  \u201c[I]nvestor behavior can vary according to the region in which they are domiciled, due to differences in the specific \nfactors that are relevant for them. Therefore, attracting a geographically diverse investor base can help smooth \nflows.\u201d IMF. World economic and financial surveys: Global Financial Stability Report\u2013Moving from Liquidity- to \nGrowth-Driven Markets April 2014. Washington, DC. p.P92. \n5  \u201c[T]he shift to more local as opposed to crossborder operations results in a decline in the sensitivity of capital flows \nto global shocks and yields a reduction in contagion. Foreign banks operating locally rather than through cross-\nborder transactions tend to contract credit much less following domestic shocks in host countries.\u201d IMF. 2015. \nWorld Economic and Financial Surveys: Global Financial Stability Report\u2013 Navigating Monetary Policy Challenges \nApril 2015. Washington, DC. P.75. \n ", "2  \n4.   The private sector advisory Group of Experts (GOE) on Cross-Border Bond Transactions \nand Settlement Issues6 was established in 2008 under ABMI and with support from ADB TA.7 \nThe group aimed to promote intra-regional investment in local currency bonds and to identify \nissues and requirements to facilitate cross-border bond transaction, as well as to determine the \nfeasibility of establishing a regional settlement intermediary (RSI).  In 2010, GOE published a \nreport that identified major regional market impediments and examined the feasibility of possible \nRSI options from a private-sector perspective.8 \n \n5.   As a follow-on to the GOE, CSIF was created in May 2013 under ABMI Task Force 4 by \nASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors to enhance dialogue among policy \nmakers and bond operators, and to discuss RSI options9. In May 2014, CSIF discussed most \nsuitable arrangements for cross-border delivery versus payment (DVP) under central banks\u2019 \nreal-time  gross  settlements  (RTGS),  10  and  chose  linkages  between  central  securities \ndepositories (CSDs) and RTGS as a model for RSI. 11 A progress report in May 2015 included a \nroad map to implement CSD\u2013RTGS linkages by 2020.12 \n \n6.  CSD\u2013RTGS linkages are expected to facilitate intra-regional portfolio investments and \nuse of local currency bonds as collateral, which is in higher demand because of regulatory shifts \nafter the global financial crisis. The linkages will expand the use of local currency bonds as \ncross-border  collateral  because  currently  they  are  locked  in  onshore  markets.  Particularly, \nCSD\u2013RTGS  linkages  will  support  banks  actively  engaging  in  cross-border  transactions  in \nASEAN+3.13 The  linkages  are  also  expected  to  support  DVP  of  cross-border  securities \ntransactions as well as payment versus payment (PVP) of the local currencies in the region.14 \nThe linkages will shorten the settlement period to less than 1 day from the current level of 2 \ndays after trading. Innovative linkages will not only reduce financial risks but also create new \ncross-border transactions.    \n   \n7.  In May 2016, ASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors endorsed a new \nABMI Medium-Term Road Map, which outlines ABMI\u2019s activities over the next 3 years15 and \nendorsed CSD\u2013RTGS linkages under CSIF by 2020. CSD\u2013RTGS linkages will serve as a \nregional safety net at the micro level for financial institutions under normal circumstances, while \n                                                \n6  The GOE members consist of national members from the PRC, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. International experts \nfrom globally active financial institutions are also members. \n7  ADB. 2008.

Asian Bond Markets Initiative Group of Experts Report for Task Force 4. Manila. \n9  ABMI currently has four task forces: Task Force 1 on promoting the issuance of local currency denominated bonds \n(co-chaired by Thailand and the PRC), Task Force 2 on facilitating demand for local currency bonds (co-chaired by \nSingapore and Japan), Task Force 3 on improving regulatory frameworks (co-chaired by Malaysia and Japan), and \nTask Force 4 on improving the infrastructure for bond markets (co-chaired by the Republic of Korea and the \nPhilippines). \n10 DVP is an arrangement that settles cash and securities simultaneously. Entitlement of securities will be transferred \nin exchange for the payment amount. This would avoid settlement risk arising from delays in delivery.  \n11 ADB. 2014.

Progress Report on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and Next Steps: Implementing \nCentral Securities Depository\u2013Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages in ASEAN+3. Manila \n13 ASEAN will recognize Qualified ASEAN Banks under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework. The linkages will \ntherefore support ASEAN efforts toward financial integration. Cross-border activities by financial institutions in \nASEAN+3 will get additional risk mitigation measures via the linkages.  \n14 PVP is a mechanism in a foreign exchange settlement system to ensure that a final transfer of one currency occurs \nonly if a final transfer of the other currency or currencies also takes place. \n15 Under the road map, at least one link is created by 2018.  \n ", "3 \n \nthe  Chiang  Mai  Initiative  Multilateralization  will  serve  as  a  regional  safety  net  to  support \nASEAN+3 member states during crises and at the macro level. \n \n8.  The Republic of Korea and the Philippines, which co-chair for ABMI TF4, requested ADB \nTA to support CSIF. They particularly requested support on technical and operational issues not \ncovered by the preceding TA: (i) further planning for and development of new linkage interfaces, \n(ii) agreement on normal and contingency operational arrangements, and (iii) mitigations for \nlegal  barriers  and  market  practices  that  may  be  impeding  cross-border  transactions.  A \nsuccessful pilot case among a few initial members from advanced markets will encourage other \nCSIF members to participate in the linkages. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be greater financial stability in ASEAN+3. The CSD\u2013RTGS linkages will \nserve as a new regional safety net to support regional financial stability at the micro level. The \nTA will support a pilot for the linkages; more central banks and CSDs in ASEAN+3 are expected \nto join in the long term. \n10.  The TA outcome will be reduced risk related to cross-border transactions. The CSD\u2013\nRTGS linkages will enable DVP and PVP, which substantially reduce cross-border settlement \nrisk. The linkages will address a shortage of collateral and facilitate foreign banks\u2019 access to \nlocal currency liquidity.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will support CSIF to implement the CSD\u2013RTGS linkages. The CSIF will propose \nnonbinding recommendations to ABMI TF4 together with a road map to address legal and \nmarket-related barriers. A successful pilot will encourage other CSIF members to participate. \nThe TA outputs are as follows: \n \n12.   Output 1: Linkages among central banks and central securities depositories in \nASEAN+3 agreed. Previous CSIF discussions suggest that if members would consider bilateral \nlinkages from advanced markets as a pilot, then other CSIF members will participate later based \non their readiness.  \n \n13.   Output 2: Report to Asian Bond Markets Initiative Task Force 4 produced. CSIF will \nmeet at least three times a year to discuss technical, legal, market-related, and operational \nissues (such as contingency and business continuity plans). The TA will report progress at \nABMI TF4 meetings, which take place twice per year. TF4 may provide guidance, if necessary.  \n \n14.   Output 3: Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum report produced. A CSIF \nreport will document key outcomes, such as operational and technical arrangements (such as \ncontingency  and  business  continuity  plans),  agreed  key  cross-border  message  items,  and \nessential user requirements of gateway to create linkages. Legal and market-related barriers will \nalso be discussed. The CSIF progress may be published as a report, with the endorsement of \nASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors. \n \n15.   Risks.  Project  risks  are  (i)  unexpected  political  development  that  disrupt  regional \ncooperation, and (ii) unexpected resource constraints at central banks and CSDs. \n ", "4  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed through a grant basis by \nthe Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, and administrated by ADB. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.   ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The Office of the Director General at the \nSustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department  will  implement  the  TA  in \nconsultation with CSIF members and ABMI TF4 co-chairs, and will supervise the consultants\u2019 \nwork.  The  office  will  closely  coordinate  with  the  Southeast  Asia  Department,  East  Asia \nDepartment, Private Sector Operations Department, and Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department in implementation. The project will be implemented over 27 months \nfrom October 2016 to December 2018. \n \n18.   The TA will require 14 person-months of individual international consulting services and \n27 person-months of individual national consulting services. International consulting services \nwill comprise (i) 5 person-months for a lead payment settlement and market systems specialist \nwho has more than 15 years of experience in designing and developing market data systems \nand extensive research experience in payment and settlement systems; (ii) 4 person-months for \na payment and settlement expert who has more than 15 years of experience in designing \nclearing and settlement systems\u2014particularly for central bank and securities depositories\u2014and \nextensive knowledge of clearing and settlement practices in ASEAN+3 markets; (iii) 4 person-\nmonths for a network and data standards specialist who has more than 10 years of experience \nin designing and managing a cross-border standardized data exchange network, specifically \none that aligns with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 20022; and (iv) 1 \nperson-month for a finance and economic editor to support publications. The 27 person-months \nfor a national consultant will involve project coordination; the successful candidate preferably \nhas 5 years\u2019 experience in project coordination and excellent oral and written English.  \n \n19.  A team from the Office of the Director General (two international staff with one acting as \nthe project manager, one national officer, and one operations assistant) will work as the CSIF \nsecretariat to facilitate communication and coordination among the member central banks and \nCSDs. The team will organize CSIF meetings in close coordination with the CSIF chairs.16  \n \n20.  Individual consultants will be recruited according to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the TA project will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). An ADB staff team from the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department \nwill regularly monitor and administer the individual contracts, and manage the combined outputs. \nIf ADB staff act as resource persons, the TA will cover only their travel costs.17  \n \n                                                \n16 Currently, CSIF chair is the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the vice chair is the Korea Securities Depository. \n17 A  memo  from  ADB\u2019s  Budget,  Personnel,  and  Management  Systems  Department  and  Strategy  and  Policy \nDepartment (26 June 2013) provides guidance on charging costs to TA and internal administrative expense \nbudgets. It states that, for preparatory works, implementation, and administrative support, ADB staff are not eligible \nto charge corresponding salaries and benefits to the TA. If the TA paper clearly specifies in its cost estimates that it \nwill provide support such as travel and administrative expenses, then such costs should be charged to the TA. \n ", "5 \n \n21.  ABMI TF4 will monitor and evaluate TA implementation at least twice per year. The TF4 \nwill evaluate the TA continuously and provide guidance as necessary. Progress will be reported \nto ASEAN+3 deputy finance ministers and central bank deputy governors at least twice per year. \nIf appropriate, progress will then be reported at the ASEAN+3 finance ministers\u2019 and central \nbank governors\u2019 annual meeting, which is held at the same time as ADB\u2019s annual meeting. \nOverall evaluation will be reflected in a TA completion report.  \n \n22.   ADB  will  purchase  equipment  (i.e.,  computer  hardware  and  software)  following  its \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and in coordination with its \nOffice of Information Systems and Technology and Office of Administrative Services, where \napplicable. After TA completion, any procured equipment will be disposed of according to the \ninstructions  on  administering  grant-financed  TA  projects. 18  Disbursements  will  be  made \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for Creating a \nRegional Settlement Intermediary in ASEAN+3: Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2013.
