INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Ministry of Economy of Uzbekistan has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to support preparation of a new welfare improvement \nstrategy (WIS) for 2011\u20132014 (WIS II). WIS II, which follows an initial WIS for 2008\u20132010 (WIS \nI), will be the main articulation of Uzbekistan\u2019s development strategy and program for the next 4 \nyears. It is, therefore, an important and strategic national policy document. ADB, in parallel, is in \nthe process of preparing a new country partnership strategy (CPS) for Uzbekistan for 2012\u2013\n2016. This overlapping preparation presents an excellent opportunity to fully align the CPS with \nWIS II. Analytical work under the proposed TA will directly assist in achieving this alignment. \n(The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.)1  \n \n2.  The TA\u2019s scope and coverage have been discussed and agreed with the Government of \nUzbekistan. In September 2010, a TA consultation and preparatory mission developed the \ncontent of the TA in consultation with the government. Subsequent consultations took place in \nOctober.  ADB  and  the  government  agreed  on  the  expected  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements. The scope of the TA was also \ndiscussed and shared with other development partners in Uzbekistan, including the World Bank, \nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Islamic Development Bank, and \nGerman  development  cooperation  through  GTZ,  who  expressed  strong  interest  in  working \ntogether with the government and ADB to support WIS II.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  WIS I supports sustainable growth and employment generation by creating favorable \nconditions for attracting private investment and deepening structural and institutional reforms to \nincrease the economy\u2019s competitiveness. This was the government\u2019s first national development \nstrategy  and  clearly  demonstrated  its  medium-term  development  objectives.  WIS  I  was \nprepared using analytical and policy inputs developed with support from TA funds of ADB and of \nother development partners, including the World Bank and UNDP.  \n \n4.  The  WIS  I  implementation  period  has  coincided  with  the  global  economic  crisis. \nUzbekistan has withstood that crisis by pursuing a robust policy response to maintain economic \nstability and growth. It consequently achieved strong growth averaging 8.6% annually during \n2008\u20132009.  High  growth  is  expected  to  continue  in  2010,  the  final  year  of  WIS  I. \nNotwithstanding domestic inflationary pressures, the country has continued to run a strong \ncurrent account surplus and has accumulated significant foreign exchange reserves during the \nWIS I period. Over the medium term, a challenge is to maintain macroeconomic stability and \nsustain high growth while making this more inclusive and broad-based. A related challenge to \nimprove  the  welfare  of  citizens  is  to  accelerate  the  pace  of  human  development  and \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \n \n5.  Preparation is now underway for WIS II. WIS II is expected to focus on deepening \nprogress toward sustainable growth, employment creation, human development, and welfare \nimprovement. The government has formally requested ADB to support WIS II through TA to \nensure preparation of a highly strategic and quality document. In this regard, assessments and \nanalysis on topics relevant to the priority areas of WIS II will help in its timely preparation and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2010. \n ", "2  \nsuccessful implementation. ADB is providing support for the preparation of an outline of WIS II \nthrough an ongoing TA for support to policy and institutional reform.2  \n \n6.  WIS II will establish medium- and long-term development goals for Uzbekistan. It will \nprovide an overview of economic and social policies in the country; assess the population\u2019s \nliving standards; and elaborate sector-level strategies for the agriculture, industry, and service \nsectors. WIS II will be fully costed and have a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan. Support \nis needed to assist the government to institutionalize WIS II as a national strategy on a country-\nwide level. \n \n7.  WIS II will include a full assessment of progress achieved under WIS I as measured by \nits anticipated outcomes and key indicators. This assessment will help identify new strategic \ndirections  and  priorities  for  WIS  II.  In  addition,  the  government  plans  to  include  broad \nstakeholder and civil society consultations on WIS II at the draft stage to ensure ownership. \nImportantly,  WIS  II  will  guide  Uzbekistan\u2019s  development  partners  in  formulating  their  own \nassistance strategies and operations in the country. \n \n8.  The new CPS will be closely aligned with WIS II and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.3 Background \nassessments  for  the  CPS  on  welfare  improvement,  governance,  and  environment  will  be \nundertaken  under  the  proposed  TA.  Thematic  aspects  such  as  gender  and  private  sector \ndevelopment will be addressed through revisions and updates to previous assessments with \nsupport from ongoing TA. Sector road maps will be developed with a results focus through \nregional TA currently being processed. All these outputs will contribute to WIS II\u2019s preparation \nand implementation. Thus, WIS II and CPS will have a common analytical base. The TA will \nutilize a consultative approach and involve extensive stakeholder participation by government \nagencies, development partners, civil society, and the private sector to ensure ownership of TA \noutputs.  \n  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The expected impact of the TA is that Government and ADB investments are aligned \nwith WIS II and CPS to sustain growth and improve welfare in Uzbekistan. This will be achieved \nby ensuring consistency of planned investment projects and programs with the priorities set in \nWIS II and the CPS. As mentioned already, the CPS itself will be fully aligned to WIS II to \nsupport the government in achieving the national goals of sustaining high growth and improving \nwelfare.  \n \n10.  The TA\u2019s outcome will be that WIS II provides a comprehensive vision for national \ndevelopment  and  has  the  full  ownership  of  the  government  and  stakeholders.  A  key \nperformance benchmark for the outcome is the government\u2019s formal adoption of WIS II by June \n2012.  To  build  wider  ownership,  WIS  II  will  be  discussed  with  and  disseminated  to  all \nstakeholders by December 2012. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2007.

Key outputs of the TA include (i) WIS II for Uzbekistan for 2011\u20132014; (ii) background \nthematic  assessments  for  CPS  in  relation  to  welfare  improvement,  governance,  and \nenvironment; as well as other analytical work linked to WIS II preparation commissioned by the \ngovernment; and (iii) participatory consultations on preparing strategies and programs. \n  \n12.  TA  outputs  will  help  the  government  and  ADB  prepare  informed  strategies  and \ndevelopment programs based on detailed background assessments and lessons learned from \nprevious  implementation  and  operational  experience.  Key  activities  associated  with \nimplementing the TA include (i) identifying and engaging key institutions and international and \nnational consultants to prepare WIS II and undertake thematic assessments and other analytical \nwork and studies, (ii) consulting in detail on strategy and program formulation with stakeholders, \nand (iii) organizing learning events and workshops to discuss and disseminate findings of \nassessments and analytical work. \n \n13.  The TA will demand full government commitment and partnership with ADB and other \ndevelopment partners to develop WIS II. Sufficient resources will need to be dedicated, and \naccess to statistical data ensured, in order to prepare high quality strategies and assessments. \nRelevant agencies under the government, private sector, and development partners will need to \nbe well coordinated in conducting analytical work. \n. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $900,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $750,000. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013\nOther Sources). The government will provide $150,000 equivalent as counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, and transport to support implementation of the TA. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The executing agency for the TA is the Ministry of Economy, which will coordinate all TA \nactivities. To organize and prepare WIS II, ADB will recruit the Institute for Macroeconomic \nForecasting and Research (IFMR) through a single-source selection method. The IFMR works \nunder the direction of the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan. It is the only institution in the \ncountry having the authority and expertise to obtain and analyze macroeconomic data from \nvarious government agencies such as the State Committee on Statistics and coordinate overall \nmacroeconomic forecasting and research initiatives at the government level. Moreover, IFMR \nplayed a lead role in preparing WIS I and institutional continuity in preparing WIS II is essential. \nThe IFMR has been authorized to convene technical working groups in relevant areas and \nsectors to discuss and debate priorities for WIS II. Some of these working groups are now \noperational and generating vigorous discussion and debate on the various aspects of WIS II. \nMembership  of  these  working  groups  is  diverse  and  includes,  in  addition  to  government \nagencies, development partners and the academia. Therefore, WIS II will be informed and \ninfluenced by balanced views and perspectives of these stakeholders. Given its unique position, \nrole, and resources, ADB considers IFMR\u2019s technical leadership and coordination essential for \npreparing WIS II and, therefore, its selection on a single-source basis for this task is appropriate. \n \n16.  In addition, 1 international consultant (3 person-months) will be recruited by ADB to help \nIFMR complete and finalize the document. \n ", "4  \n \n17.  The  preparation  of  background  thematic  assessments  in  the  areas  of  welfare \nimprovement, governance, and environment is critical for CPS and will, at the same time, assist \nin deepening the analytical foundations of WIS II. For the welfare improvement assessment, \nADB will recruit the Institute for Social Researches (ISR) through a single-source selection \nmethod.  The  government  has  vested  the  ISR,  working  under  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  of \nUzbekistan, with the exclusive mandate to undertake systematic monitoring and assessment of \nthe population\u2019s living standards. It conducts regular welfare assessments and other analyses \nrelated to living standards based on household budget and other surveys. In addition, the ISR, \njointly with UNDP, regularly conducts multiple indicator cluster surveys for monitoring welfare \nstatus of children and women. These surveys and assessments are critical for developing an \nunderstanding  of  welfare  trends  in  the  country.  Single-source  selection  is  considered \nappropriate because there is no other entity in Uzbekistan with the authority and capacity to \nconduct such surveys. Neither individual consultants nor private sector firms have access to the \ndata and information needed to conduct these welfare assessments. \n \n18.  With the welfare improvement assessment, ISR will help improve understanding of living \nstandards in the country, provide relevant data and information, and strengthen the analytical \nbase of the CPS and WIS II. ISR\u2019s analysis will be triangulated with information and analysis on \nliving standards originating from such other development agencies as UNDP and the World \nBank to ensure a rounded and balanced welfare assessment. \n \n19.  Both IFMR and ISR have been set up as independent research institutions under their \nrespective presidential decrees and charters. The institutes are legal entities with independent \nbalance sheets, bank settlement accounts, and other business attributes and details necessary \nfor their operations. The institutes are legally entitled to enter into contracts with national and \ninternational  bodies,  sign  contracts  for  joint  research,  and  access  funds  from  international \nfinance institutions and donor agencies. They have the right to develop their own resource \nbases, are not subject to taxation, and are fully accountable for the reliability of their accounting \ndata and balance sheet calculations. \n \n20.  To lead governance risk assessments and prepare risk management plans at country \nand sector levels for the CPS, ADB will recruit 1 international (3 person-months) and 3 national \n(9 person-months) consultants. The international consultant will lead the team and prepare the \noverall  assessments.  Each  national  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  one  sector-level \ngovernance risk assessment for a priority sector in the CPS. Finally, one international consultant \n(3 person-months) and one national consultant (3 person-months) will prepare an environment \nassessment for Uzbekistan as an input to the CPS. \n \n21.  The TA will need 1 international facilitator (1 person-month), two national facilitators (2 \nperson-months),  1  international  editor  (2  person-months),  and  1  national  editor  (2  person-\nmonths).  \n \n22.  The consultants referred to in paras. 16, 20, and 21 (constituting a total of 28 person-\nmonths of individual consulting services: 12 person-months for international consultants and 16 \nperson-months for national consultants) will be recruited on an individual basis. The outline \nterms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  engage  all  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on The Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and \nIts  Borrowers  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Each  assignment  earmarked  for  an \nindividual consultant under the TA is independent, has its own terms of reference indicating the \nrequired tasks and outputs, and does not require a team effort. Each individual consultant will \n ", "  5\nwork independently under a direct contract with ADB. A joint Central and West Asia Operations \nCoordination Division and Uzbekistan Resident Mission team will administer the TA and ensure \nsmooth implementation of consultants\u2019 contracts. TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All \nequipment  purchased  for  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  The TA emphasizes building country ownership of TA outputs and outcomes. This will \nbe  managed  by  organizing  in-depth  consultations  with  stakeholders  from  the  government, \nprivate sector, and civil society on strategy and program formation as well as policy and analysis \nwork.  WIS  II  drafts  and  background  assessments  for  the  CPS  will  be  discussed  and \ndisseminated in specific workshops and seminars before these are finalized.  \n \n24.  Progress on the TA will be regularly monitored by the mission leader and responsible \nUzbekistan Resident Mission staff through TA progress monitoring reports. These reports will \nassess outputs from IFMR, ISR, and the individual consultants; feedback from the government; \nand progress being made toward achieving the outcome and outputs set forth in the design and \nmonitoring framework.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Uzbekistan  for  Sustaining  Growth  and  Improving  Welfare,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and   \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nGovernment and ADB  CPS fully aligned with  WIS II monitoring and  Full government commitment to \ninvestments are aligned  WIS II  review reports  implement stated strategies and \nwith WIS II and CPS to      programs \nsustain growth and  Beginning 2013,  Government investment \nimprove welfare in  government and ADB  reports \nUzbekistan  investment projects and \nprograms consistent with \nWIS II and CPS priority \nsectors \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nWIS II provides a  WIS II formally adopted  Government reports and  Sufficient resources are \ncomprehensive vision for  by the government by  notifications  dedicated and access to \nnational development  June 2012    statistical data is provided to \nand has full ownership of      preparing high quality strategy \ngovernment and  WIS II discussed with  WIS II dissemination  documents and analytical \nstakeholders  and disseminated to all  workshop reports  assessments. \nstakeholders by     \nDecember 2012    Background assessments and \n    analysis influence the direction \nWIS II includes a  WIS II paper  of new strategies and \ncomprehensive results  programs. \nframework with clear \nperformance targets and \nindicators \nOutputs       Assumptions \n       \n1.
