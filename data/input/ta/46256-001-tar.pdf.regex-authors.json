The  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \n(GMS)1 promotes connectivity and competitiveness. While connectivity has improved, weak \ninstitutional and operational capacities\u2014including management of sanitary and phytosanitary \n(SPS) measures\u2014have hindered the optimal use of infrastructure in the GMS, limited potential \ntrade integration and expansion opportunities, and reduced protection from trade-related health \nhazards.2 In 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a regional SPS project to \naddress capacity constraints in the handling of SPS measures in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam and an attached technical assistance (TA) \nmainly  to  support  implementation,  monitoring,  and  coordination  of  the  regional  project  in \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.3 \n \n2.  The  proposed  TA,  included  in  the  regional  cooperation  operations  business  plan,  \n2012\u20132014, is in line with the GMS 10-year strategic framework, 2012\u20132022 and supports the \nexpansion of trade and improved trade-related health.4 The TA supports the  Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020  and  the  strategic  priority  on  regional  cooperation  and  integration.5  The  TA \nconcept paper was approved on 2 July 2013. To confirm that demand for the TA remained high \nand to finalize the scope, content, and implementation arrangements, ADB conducted fact-\nfinding missions in August\u2013September 2013. The mission found strong support and ownership \nfor the TA, and concluded that the activities need to be prioritized, taking into account advice \nfrom the GMS countries. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Reducing transaction costs in cross-border trade requires close cooperation among all \nthe agencies that have regulatory responsibilities for processing and clearing goods. While \ncustoms agencies take key responsibility for the clearance of goods, SPS, commerce, police, \ntransport, and other agencies also play major roles. In cross-border trade, customs and SPS \nagencies are particularly important as they are most responsible for revenue collection and the \nprotection of society from harmful imports. Data show that customs agencies are often only \nresponsible for a third of border delays; the administration of other requirements, including SPS \nrequirements, accounts for the rest.7 This suggests that border modernization needs to extend \nbeyond customs reforms. In the GMS, SPS agencies are way behind their customs counterparts, \nparticularly in the application of automation and the use of modern risk-based approaches to \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2004.

Washington, DC. \n \n ", "2   \nregulatory compliance. Such constraints make establishing effective collaboration between SPS \nagencies and customs agencies very challenging.  \n \n4.  Countries must establish and maintain rigorous surveillance and inspection programs \nand procedures to meet SPS requirements. In the GMS, information, rules, and processes \ngoverning  SPS  procedures  are  not  systematic,  and  the  capacity  to  undertake  risk-based \nsurveillance programs, testing, diagnosis, and inspection is limited. This is particularly evident in \nthe  smaller  GMS  members  and  is  the  main  rationale  behind  ADB\u2019s  SPS  regional  project \n(footnote  3).  In  addition  to  these  country-level  initiatives,  a  GMS  action  plan  for  SPS \narrangements,  2010\u20132015  identified  several  SPS  issues  that  have  important  regional \nimplications and require regional solutions.  \n \n5.  Harmonized SPS procedures and information sharing. First, the regional analysis of \nquarantine pest lists and their harmonization is a major contributor to building effective regional \ncooperation and mutual confidence. Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam have started to \nimprove their quarantine pest lists. Since most pests in the GMS are similar and easily cross \nborders, countries could benefit from information sharing and agreement on the quarantine pest \nlists with their neighbors. The TA will prioritize pests affecting the main products traded in the \nregion. Second, the GMS has a considerable amount of forest and timber imports and exports, \nbut little attention has been given to this area. As a result, scant research and information is \navailable  about  forest  and  timber  pests.  To  ensure  sustainable  development,  a  common \nunderstanding of timber and forest pests is necessary. Third, some GMS countries have no \nclear policies and limited capacity to manage market access pre-approvals for new processed \nproducts. Kick-starting the analysis of issues and supporting regional discussions will lay the \nfoundation for the GMS countries to move towards regional cooperation. \n \n6.  Harmonized commodity description and coding system. Customs agencies maintain \nthe master reference files for the harmonized commodity description and coding system for \nimports and exports. Ideally, SPS agencies should use the same coding system to define \nproducts that are subject to SPS requirements as that would allow the agencies to communicate \nand identify goods. However, this is not the case in many GMS countries. In Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, and Viet Nam, information sharing between SPS and customs agencies is still paper-\nbased,  and  basic  issues  such  as  sharing  product  information,  coding  systems,  risk \ncategorization, and risk profiles are lacking. These gaps will ultimately create difficulties in \ndeveloping and operating electronic national single windows for trade facilitation, which the \ncountries have committed to establishing as part of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) integration agenda. Intraregional trade of agriculture, food, and forestry products is \nrising in the GMS, reaching more than $20.3 billion in 2011. As all of these imports and exports \nare subject to SPS requirements, seamless collaboration among GMS countries nationally and \nregionally has become increasingly important.  \n \n7.  Challenges  in  risk  management,  and  cooperation  between  customs  and  SPS \nagencies. While the case for interagency cooperation is clear, some practical challenges need \nto be overcome. Solving them requires detailed analysis of issues such as (i) the rules and \nprocedures governing the risk categorization of products subject to SPS requirements; (ii) the \ncurrent status of risk categorization, and how that relates to the commodity description and \ncoding  system  and  is  managed  by  customs;  (iii)  the  capacity  to  apply  risk  management \ntechniques; and (iv) actions for improvement and regional harmonization. Some progress has \nbeen made but many difficulties remain. For example, the Government of Cambodia issued a \nsub-decree  to  apply  risk  management  across  all  border  management  agencies  in  2006; \nsubsequently, some service-level agreements were signed between customs and other border ", "3 \n \nmanagement agencies. While this was a positive first step, this initiative could not be fully \nimplemented because of the absence of risk management skills in non-customs agencies. \nThere is strong demand from the countries\u2014Cambodia and the Lao PDR in particular\u2014to help \nnon-customs agencies develop the risk management skills and tools necessary to facilitate \ntrade, while protecting their communities from potentially harmful imports.  \n \n8.  The TA will build on ADB\u2019s regional SPS project for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and  \nViet Nam, and extend more analysis and consultations to the wider GMS by focusing on issues \nwith regional implications. It will facilitate regional cooperation and build consensus on priorities. \nThe TA will examine cooperation between customs and SPS agencies in the GMS to strengthen \nthe links between them, particularly in the areas of risk profiling and information sharing through \na  coherent  approach  to  risk  management.  The  analysis  will  lay  the  essential  steps  that \ncontribute towards the automation of SPS agencies and the establishment of national single \nwindows to facilitate trade. It supports the Asian Cargo Highway to create a seamless flow of \ngoods  in  Asia.  The  TA  will  help  participating  SPS  and  customs  agencies  improve  their \nknowledge  management.  The  TA  supports  the  GMS  and  the  ASEAN  agenda,  and  will \ncoordinate closely with the main development partners.8 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be larger quantities of agriculture, food, and forestry products traded in \nthe GMS. The outcome will be more rigorous SPS management systems established in the \nGMS to cooperate with customs administrations in facilitating trade. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The outcome will be achieved through the delivery of three outputs: (i) an analysis of SPS \nissues and cooperation between customs and SPS agencies (output 1), (ii) capacity development \nand regional cooperation mechanisms (output 2), and (iii) the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nframework (output 3). Producing TA outputs will be resource-intensive, as regional proposals \nrequire country-based consultations. \n \n11.  To achieve output 1, the TA will analyze (i) information sharing and risk management for \ncustoms and SPS agencies; and (ii) three SPS regional issues: pest quarantine lists, forest and \ntimber pests, and first-time market access for imports of new food products. These analyses will \ncenter  on  the  operational  aspects  of  the  SPS  and  customs  agencies  in  undertaking  their \nregulatory tasks, and will identify solutions. \n \n12.  In line with the review of the status of SPS risk-based border management regimes and \nplans for  information  sharing  between  customs  and  SPS  agencies,  the  TA  will  (i)  identify \ncapacity gaps in border release processes in the GMS, focusing on Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nand Viet Nam; and (ii) propose ways to enhance and/or harmonize adoption. The TA will \nconduct surveys on the SPS release processes in the three GMS countries to produce baseline \ndata and information about SPS procedures and costs in trade.9 Practical solutions are needed \n                                                \n8  Such as the United Nations technical agencies, the World Bank, and bilateral agencies, which have supported \nvarious aspects of SPS capacity development and trade facilitation in the GMS. \n9  The  Standards  and  Trade  Development  Facility,  under  the  World  Trade  Organization,  has  developed  a \nmethodology and started a pilot on selected elements of transaction cost surveys attributed by SPS measures for \n \n ", "4   \nfor  a  number  of  issues,  especially  (i)  information  sharing  about  SPS  risk  categorization,  \n(ii) information sharing about products subject to SPS risks under the harmonized commodity \ndescription and coding system, (iii) advance information sharing to enable timely SPS risk \nmanagement decisions, (iv) principles for automation of SPS agencies with links to customs \nautomation, and (v) the identification of good practices and the development of solutions. The \nTA will involve the private sector through consultations and surveys. \n \n13.  Pest lists in the GMS countries will be compared and analyzed. The TA experts\u2019 team, \ntogether with specialists in the GMS countries, will review pest list development and identify \ncommonalities in pest lists and incidence. Possible harmonization of pest list will be presented \nat the technical meetings. For forest pests and pest lists in the GMS, the TA will (i) collect data \nthrough passive surveillance from traders and public sector specialists; (ii) gather information on \nthe trade of forest products and timber, and the impact of SPS measures; and (iii) discuss \nissues concerning forest and timber pest control. The TA will review good practices in handling \nmarket access requests for pre-approvals of processed food products. Input from the GMS \ncountries  with  established  capacities  in  risk  analysis  will  be  invited  in  order  to  identify \ninformation-sharing possibilities in risk assessments and management decisions. \n \n14.  Relevant  international  standards  or  recommendations  (World  Trade  Organization, \nWorld Customs Organization, International Plant Protection Convention, World Animal Health \nOrganization, Codex Alimentarius, and ASEAN) will be followed to guide capacity development \nin SPS and customs agencies, and to promote regional cooperation and harmonization. \n \n15.  To achieve output 2, the TA will (i) conduct regional experts\u2019 meetings to discuss \ninformation-sharing mechanisms between customs and SPS agencies; identify gaps that require \ninvestment, including information and communication technology; and share experiences and \nlessons  learned;  (ii)  conduct  regional  meetings  to  discuss  harmonization  and  cooperation \nmechanisms  among  SPS  agencies;  (iii)  conduct  technical  meetings  and  make  training \nproposals  on the  exchange  of  staff  among technical  agencies;  and (iv)  provide  in-country \ntechnical advice and training by the TA experts\u2019 team. The TA will draw inputs from the country-\nbased SPS projects for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, and strengthen them by \nbringing in analysis, expertise, and knowledge from the other GMS countries. The TA will also \nbring in additional expertise on customs modernization and SPS management from outside the \nGMS, including from Japan. Coordination of national and regional cooperation is important. \n \n16.  To achieve output 3, the TA will design an M&E framework that monitors and evaluates \nTA activities, outputs, outcome, and impact, and prepares periodical M&E reports. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,150,000 of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  GMS \ngovernments will provide counterpart support in the form of staff to work with the TA experts\u2019 \nteam, participate and make contributions in technical meetings and regional meetings, and \nprovide office space during the field visits by the TA consultant team. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Thailand. Countries consider it useful to scale up this work under the \nTA. \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA  will  be  implemented from  October  2014 to  August  2017.  ADB, through  its \nSoutheast Asia Department, will be the executing agency for the TA and will work closely with \nthe core agencies in the GMS countries, coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and \nFisheries in Cambodia and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the Lao PDR, and the \nVietnam  Food  Administration  in  Viet  Nam,  with  participation  of  other  SPS  agencies  and \nexpanded to the customs agencies. These agencies are the respective executing agencies for \nthe SPS regional project for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. Since little work has been \ndone in Myanmar and its participation would require a disproportionally large part of the limited \nTA resources to capture basic pictures and background analysis, the TA activities will focus on \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. The TA will be coordinated by the National Bureau of \nAgriculture Commodity and Food Standards in Thailand and by the Ministry of Commerce in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China at the country level. Implementation will be carried out by the SPS \nagencies10 and the customs agencies. TA implementation will be closely coordinated with the \nGMS national coordinators\u2019 offices. Close coordination will also be maintained with the GMS \nworking group on agriculture and the work related to GMS trade facilitation. All disbursements \nunder the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The TA requires 46 person-months of international and 40 person-months of national \nconsulting services with expertise in SPS and customs risk-based border management and \nclearance,  information  and  communication  technology,  SPS  plant  pests,  forest  pests,  and \nmarket access. A consulting firm, recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method \n(80:20), will be engaged. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). TA implementation will be \nlogistically demanding, requiring the consultants\u2019 team to plan and consult the GMS countries \nand ADB. \n \n20.  The consultants will submit to ADB and the GMS countries (i) an inception report, \n(ii) interim  progress  reports  at  appropriate  stages,  (iii)  a  draft  summary  final  report,  and  \n(iv) a revised final report. The consultants will also submit consolidated and individual technical \nreports required by the outline terms of reference. \n \n21.  ADB  review  missions  will  regularly  monitor  and  report  on  major  TA  activities. \nConsultants\u2019 reports will be presented in regional meetings and/or workshops. Reports will be \nmade  available  on  ADB  website  and  published  whenever  warranted  for  the  meetings  of \nstakeholders. The TA will also include selective dissemination activities to share lessons and \nexperience among GMS countries, as well as other developing member countries, such as \nthose in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n22.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for  Enhancing  Capacity  of  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary \nArrangements to Facilitate Trade in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n                                                \n10 Including the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and the Ministry of \nAgriculture in PRC. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets     \n  and Indicators with  Data Sources and   \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2020:    Assumption \nLarger quantities of  Intraregional trade in  International and national  Participating countries \nagriculture, food, and  AFF products in GMS  trade statistics, World  and agencies continue to \nforestry (AFF) products  increases annually by  Integrated Trade Solution,  be committed to trade \ntraded in the Greater  15% (2011 baseline:  United Nations  facilitation for AFF \nMekong Subregion  $20.3 billion)  Commodities Trade  products \n(GMS)   Statistics Database   \nRisk \nExogenous shocks and \nmajor health hazards  \ne.g., Severe acute \nrespiratory syndrome \n(SARS), avian or swine \nflu) emerge, resulting in \nreallocation of resources \nfrom trade facilitation\n \nOutcome  By 2017:    Assumption \nMore rigorous sanitary  Modalities on systematic  Consultations with  Trading partners\u2019 \nand phytosanitary (SPS)  information sharing  stakeholders and  continuing demand for \nmanagement systems  between customs and  development partners  GMS AFF products \nestablished to cooperate  SPS agencies agreed  active in trade facilitation   \nwith customs agencies  upon (no regional    Risk \nin facilitating trade  systematic information  National databases:  Coordination between \nsharing in 2013)  customs and SPS  customs agencies and \n  agencies (ministries of  SPS agencies remains \nRegional pest lists  agriculture, health, or  weak \ninitiated for priority- other SPS lead agencies) \ntraded products (no   \nharmonization in 2013)  Results of SPS \n  transaction costs survey \nRegional first-time  and studies \nmarket access   \nmechanisms for food  Technical assistance (TA) \nproducts initiated (no  completion report \nharmonized market \naccess mechanisms in \nplace in 2013) \n \nCommon understanding \nof forest and timber \npests in the GMS \nreached (lack of \ninformation and \ncommon understanding \nin 2013)\n \nOutputs  By 2017:    Assumptions \n1.
