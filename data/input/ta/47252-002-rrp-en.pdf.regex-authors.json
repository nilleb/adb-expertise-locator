THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the Regional Urban Development Project. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Strengthening Capacity for Urban Planning, Urban Design, and Investment \nPlanning. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will improve the resilience and delivery of urban services and facilities in eight \nmunicipalities1 in the southern Terai region of Nepal bordering India, including four municipalities \nfrom the less-developed Province 7 in far western Nepal.2 The project will support municipal \ninfrastructure investments, urban planning, and institutional strengthening. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Nepal\u2019s urbanization and economic growth. Although Nepal has been urbanizing at a \nrapid rate of 6% since the 1970s, its economic growth is lower than that of other South Asian \ncountries.3 Inadequate urban planning, weak urban institutions and municipal finances, neglect \nof  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  limited  capabilities  for  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment have partly contributed to the lower rate of growth.4 The government would need to \ndouble its share of gross domestic product spent on urban infrastructure to meet the backlog and \nfuture demand up to 2030 with an estimated $24.5 billion for its 217 municipalities.5 Planned \nurbanization through a regional approach can stimulate economic growth in Nepal, especially in \nthe southern Terai region, where opportunities for economic growth have increased due to \nregional cooperation and trade.6 \n \n4.  Importance of investing in the Terai region. The Terai region has the country\u2019s largest \nurban population outside the Kathmandu and Pokhara valleys, and its urban areas are growing. \nMost  trade  in  landlocked  Nepal  flows  through  the  three  Terai  municipalities  of  Biratnagar \n(population: 235,000), Birgunj (population: 240,000) and Siddharthanagar (population: 73,000).7 \nA fourth municipality, Nepalgunj (population: 175,000), is a major industrial and business hub of \nits province. Along the border with India, regional clusters of nonfarm economic activities are \nemerging, which could be fostered to boost economic growth. Several initiatives have been \ncompleted or are ongoing in the Terai, many supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nto facilitate trade and improve regional connectivity, rural\u2013urban links, power supply, agricultural \n                                                \n1  The eight project municipalities are Biratnagar in Province 1; Birgunj in Province 2; Nepalgunj and Siddharthanagar \nin Province 5; and Bheemdatt, Dhangadhi, Godawari, and Shuklaphanta in Province 7. \n2  The project preparation was supported by technical assistance. ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for the Far Western \nRegion Urban Development Project. Manila (TA 8817-NEP, approved in 2014); and ADB. 2015.

Technical Assistance to Nepal for Setting Infrastructure Investment on a Growth Trajectory (Urban \nDevelopment Chapter). Manila. \n6  The regional approach is an integrated and planned approach of spatial development of urban centers surrounded \nby adjacent or smaller municipalities and rural areas to enhance competitiveness and stimulate economic growth by \nfacilitating  common  infrastructure,  strategic  infrastructure,  proximity  to  supply  chains  and  networks,  and \nconcentration of human resources and skills. The project is expected to lay the foundation for greater regional \ndevelopment. \n7  World Bank. 2014. Nepal Trade Facilitation and Improvement Study. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \nproductivity, and the quality of technical education.8 ADB-financed urban projects are also near \ncompletion  in  the  four  regional  economic  centers  of  Biratnagar,  Birgunj,  Nepalgunj,  and \nSiddharthanagar.9 The urban projects have reduced the duration of flooding during heavy rains \nin the core areas of the four municipalities from an average of 3.5 days to 3 hours. Additional \nsupport is required to scale up previous efforts to minimize flooding, strengthen municipal \noperations, and make the Terai region more livable and competitive. \n \n5.  Investing in the Terai of Province 7. Province 7 in the far west of Nepal is one of the \npoorest provinces in Nepal, with 40% of the population living below the poverty line.10 Urban \ninfrastructure and basic services in this province need significant improvement. None of the \nProvince 7 municipalities has solid waste and wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and \nstorm water drainage is inadequate. One-third of households experience chronic waterlogging \nand/or do not have modern toilet facilities. Key roads are in poor condition and peri-urban areas \nare expanding haphazardly. Growth opportunities in the province are likely to increase with the \nanticipated construction of the Mahakali River Bridge connecting India and far western Nepal. \nInvestments in urban infrastructure and planned urbanization in Province 7 will have a multiplier \neffect on economic growth and job creation while reducing regional disparities. \n \n6.  Regional Urban Development Project. The project will scale up investments in the four \nmunicipalities of Biratnagar, Birgunj, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar, where ADB\u2019s ongoing \nurban projects are near completion. The project aims to reduce flooding duration to less than \n1 hour in these municipalities. In the four municipalities of Province 7 (Bheemdatt, Dhangadhi, \nGodawari, and Shuklaphanta), ADB for the first time will invest in urban infrastructure that will \nimprove flood management, mobility, and solid waste management. The project will support the \ndevelopment of urban plans and bylaws that reflect greater disaster risk resilience, improved land \nmanagement, and regional development. The subprojects were selected based on households\u2019 \npriorities, the municipalities\u2019 priorities, feasibility studies, and institutional mandate. To create \nincentives for the Province 7 municipalities to improve governance and financial and operational \nperformance,  the  project  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  performance-based \nsocioeconomic  development  program  (PBSEDP).11 The  project  will  also  support  a  project \ndevelopment facility12 for the preparation of a pipeline of urban infrastructure projects with high \nreadiness to reduce future startup delays.  \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2006.

Alignment with policies and strategies. The project is aligned with Nepal\u2019s Fourteenth \nPlan and with the National Urban Policy 2007, which aim for a balanced national urban system \nby developing centers of growth that provide an alternative to the Kathmandu Valley.13 The project \nis also aligned with Nepal\u2019s National Urban Development Strategy (2017), which also aims for \nregionally balanced development, as well as more planned and sustainable urbanization (footnote \n4). The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for Nepal,14 which \nsupports the government\u2019s development objective of sustainable, broad-based, and inclusive \neconomic growth through the development of urban infrastructure and better access to basic \nservices. \n \n8.  Lessons. The project incorporates the following lessons from ADB\u2019s previous urban \ndevelopment operations in Nepal and other countries: (i) provide an integrated set of investments \nthat will have a tangible impact;15 (ii) secure early commitment of municipalities, including on \nsafeguards compliance and land acquisition; (iii) provide significant support and monitoring for \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  an  increase  in own-source  revenue;16 (iv)  provide  adequate \nresources in civil works contracts for shifting of utilities and utility mapping; (v) include a regional \ndimension for planning and development to tackle challenges more holistically; and (vi) ensure \nprojects with high readiness. \n \n9.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project will improve capacity and competitiveness \nof border municipalities and complement the efforts of the ADB-supported South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation Program, which has enabled greater connectivity and trade facilitation \nbetween Nepal and other countries in the region. The project builds on ADB\u2019s long-standing \npartnership and experience supporting urban development in Nepal and will reduce regional \ninequalities by supporting Province 7. ADB assistance emphasizes resilience in spatial and \ninfrastructure  planning  and  sustainability  of  infrastructure  through  (i)  high-quality  designs, \nincluding  for  climate  resilience;  (ii)  support  and  monitoring  of  action  plans  to  increase \nmunicipalities\u2019 own-source revenue; and (iii) O&M capacity building. The project will introduce a \nPBSEDP and a project development facility, both of which address development challenges in a \nnovel manner. The PBSEDP is a grant provided to Province 7 project municipalities upon \nachieving governance and institutional performance parameters. The project complements the \nwork of other development partners in various municipalities on disaster risk management and \npublic financial management. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban \nareas developed; and a balanced and prosperous subnational urban system achieved (footnote \n4). The project will have the following outcome: quality, sustainability, and disaster resilience of \nurban services, and competitiveness in eight municipalities of the Terai region improved.17 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: Urban infrastructure in eight municipalities with climate-resilient and \nsustainable designs constructed or rehabilitated.

Under the second output, the TRTA will (i) refine and improve the methodology and \napproach  to  existing  urban  infrastructure  investment  programs;  (ii)  restructure  and  update \nDUDBC\u2019s business plan, taking into consideration the National Urban Development Strategy \napproved  in  2017  (footnote  4);  (iii)  strengthen  capacity  of  and  support  the  DUDBC  and \nmunicipalities in reviewing the engineering designs and related safeguard documents; and (iv) \ndevelop phased investment plans for two large municipalities (or cluster of municipalities). The \nTRTA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6).25 The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. MOUD will be the \nexecuting agency for the TA, which will be implemented over a period of 2.5 years. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The appraisal of the subprojects confirmed technical viability and compatibility with local \nimplementation  and  O&M  capacity.  The  pending  detailed  design  will  adhere  to  subproject \nselection and agreed design criteria, address the flood risks and increases in rainfall due to \nclimate  change,  and  analyze  least  life-cycle  costs.  Municipal  buildings  will  be  earthquake \nresistant. Stormwater management planning will take a catchment-wide approach. Utility mapping \nwill be done in project areas to provide municipalities with the required geospatial data to improve \nmanagement of underground assets. Technical audits will be undertaken through a government \nagency to help ensure the quality of works. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic analysis. The economic internal rate of return was estimated at 11.9%, \nindicating sufficient economic return compared with the economic opportunity cost of capital of \n9.0%. The results of the sensitivity analysis are also satisfactory against all downside risks, i.e., \n(i) a capital cost overrun of 20%, (ii) an overrun in O&M costs of 20%, (iii) a decline in estimated \nbenefits of 20%, and (iv) a 1-year delay in operations. \n \n22.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis assessed whether the municipalities can cover \nthe incremental costs of the project since not all subprojects will generate revenues. The overall \nmunicipal financial position is projected reflecting incremental revenues and expenditures as well \nas debt service requirements based on past performance, growth trend of revenue streams, and \nexpected population growth. The analysis confirms that the municipalities will have adequate \nfinancial capacity to cover counterpart costs, incremental O&M costs of the subprojects, and debt \nservice requirements of existing loans. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  Financial management. The overall risk assessment for the project is substantial. The \nPCO and non-Province 7 municipalities have experience in implementing ADB projects. For \nProvince 7 municipalities, extensive support to the regional PIU and municipalities is needed for \n                                                \n25  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nefficient financial management and implementation. DUDBC and all project municipalities can \nmanage  funds  with  the  following  mitigation  measures:  (i)  training  on  project  financial \nmanagement; (ii) development of a computerized accounting system for PCO and PIUs; (iii) \nestablishment of an internal audit section in Godawari and Shuklaphanta and appointment of \nqualified internal auditors in Biratnagar and Birgunj; (iv) enhancement of the accounting, billing \nand collection, and audit systems for Province 7 municipalities; and (v) preparation of municipal \nfinancial operating plans prior to formulation of budget, and implementation and close monitoring \nof plans to improve own-source revenue collection. The financial management arrangements are \nexpected to be satisfactory. \n \n24.  Procurement.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) or, for national competitive bidding, the public \nprocurement monitoring office\u2019s standard bidding document as approved by ADB. All procurement \nof consultants, including for the project development facility, will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nuse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). An assessment concluded that the \noverall procurement risk for the project is substantial. Procurement specialists from the Province \n7  design  and  supervision  consulting  firm  will  support  the  regional  PIU,  and  the  project \nmanagement consultant will support the PCO to prepare and evaluate bids. \n \n25.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, MOUD, DUDBC, and project municipalities. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM.  The \nconstitutional anticorruption agency is the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, \nwhich is empowered to investigate any project irregularities. The PCO and PIUs will follow \ngovernment rules and procedures for expenses and revenues. They will establish a project \nwebsite for transparency and a system for handling complaints. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy and a GESI action plan have been prepared. The project will include \nsafety features such as streetlights, road markings, ramps, and footpaths. The project will \nstrengthen the capacity of social development sections in project municipalities. The project will \nalso support Province 7 municipalities in implementing the PBSEDP, which focuses on improving \ngovernance and service delivery, as well as implementing small infrastructure in low-income \ncommunities  through  the  community  procurement  method.  The  project  will  promote  the \nparticipation of women and other disadvantaged groups through community-based committees. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  The PAM outlines the detailed implementation arrangements for safeguards. DUDBC has \nthe capacity to implement safeguards based on its experience in the ongoing ADB-financed \nprojects.  Any  subproject  that  causes  significant  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, or indigenous peoples will be excluded from project financing. The PCO and PIUs \nhave adequate capacity to manage environmental and social impacts. A consultant will support \nand build the capacity of the PCO and PIUs in social safeguard planning and implementation. \nSupervision consultants will supervise day-to-day safeguard implementation. The entitlement \nmatrix includes measures to ensure compensation at replacement cost, rehabilitation assistance \nand special measures for vulnerable households, and criteria for accepting voluntary demolition \nof minor structures.  \n \n ", "9 \n28.  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment review framework and four \ninitial environmental examinations (IEEs)26 with environmental management plans were prepared \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws. IEEs will be \nupdated based on the detailed design. The documents were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website and \nrelevant information disclosed to project communities. The IEEs concluded that no significant \nadverse impacts are anticipated. Any impacts will be mitigated through measures outlined in the \nenvironmental management plans. The drainage, road, and SWM works will reduce water and air \npollution. The PCO will submit environment reports to ADB semiannually. Consultation and public \nparticipation will continue throughout implementation, and any environmental grievances will be \nhandled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement impact assessment confirms that impacts are not significant. The land acquisition \nprocess for a total of 30 hectares required for landfill sites has begun, and 65% is government \nland. A total of 27 households (172 people) are expected to be affected, of which 15 households \n(92 persons) will be significantly affected because they lose 10% or more of their productive \nassets. The land acquisition will affect three indigenous households. A combined resettlement \nand  indigenous  peoples  plan (CRIPP)  and  three  due  diligence  reports27 were  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) to mitigate negative impacts. The \nresettlement impacts, mitigation measures, policy provisions, and SWM subproject details and \nrelated impacts were discussed with potentially affected persons. Meaningful consultations shall \ncontinue throughout implementation. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Indigenous peoples live in the project area. No \nconfirmed negative impacts were identified, except for the acquisition of land belonging to three \nindigenous households for the landfill site in Dhangadhi. Indigenous peoples living in the project \narea are likely to experience positive impacts thanks to better roads, drainage, SWM, and \nsanitation. The PBSEDP will include an awareness program for indigenous peoples and their \nparticipation  will  be  ensured  during  subproject  design  and  implementation.  A  combined \nresettlement and indigenous peoples planning framework was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and applicable laws. If required, the framework will guide the \npreparation of resettlement and indigenous peoples plans during the detailed design. The PIUs \nwere trained on the framework. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n31.  Major risks and suggested mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. All major risks  \nare described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 The overall benefits \nare expected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nWeak institutional  Support for increasing municipalities\u2019 own-source revenue, development of \ncapacity of project  computerized accounting system, establishment of an internal audit section and \nmunicipalities on  recruitment of additional financial administration staff in Godawari and \nfinancial management  Shuklaphanta, and support to strengthen internal audit in Biratnagar and Birgunj. \n                                                \n26 IEEs were prepared for Dhangadhi, Godawari, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar. \n27 CRIPP for landfill site in Dhangadhi; and due diligence reports for subprojects in Biratnagar, Godawari, and \nShuklaphanta municipalities. \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInsufficient municipal  Provide support through the project for the municipalities to achieve the targets \ncounterpart funding   agreed in the comprehensive financial management improvement plans. \nPoor oversight of  PMC and PCO shall undertake regular site visits.

ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The government and MOUD have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and MOUD have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR108,008,000 ($150,000,000 equivalent) (footnote 22)  to Nepal for \nthe Regional Urban Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional \nterms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n29 August 2017\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with  \nSustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban areas developed; and balanced and prosperous subnational \nurban system achieved (National Urban Development Strategy)a \n  Data Sources \nPerformance Indicators with Targets and  and Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2023:     \nQuality,  a.
