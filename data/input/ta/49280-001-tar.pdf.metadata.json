The proposed $1.3 million capacity development technical assistance (TA) is designed \nto  complement  the  $3.0  million  equity  investment  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nsupporting the $14.8 million expansion plan of Mountain Hazelnut Venture Private Limited \n(MHV)\u2014a  company  engaged  in  promoting  hazelnut  production  by  smallholder  farmers  in \nBhutan since 2010.1 ADB\u2019s equity investment was approved on 11 June 2015.2 \n \n2.  The TA will target farmers as the primary beneficiaries of assistance. While ADB\u2019s equity \ninvestment is mainly focused on ensuring commercial success of the company, the TA will \nensure that smallholder farmers (particularly women) are better prepared to cope with the \nnegative consequences of climate change and fully benefit from their inclusion in the hazelnut \nvalue chain. Bhutanese farmers are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate \nchange  (e.g., drought,  floods,  and  landslides).  The  TA  will  provide  training  and  pilot  test \naffordable technologies to increase the climate resilience of the 15,000 smallholder farmers to \nbe engaged in the hazelnut value chain being developed by MHV. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Climate change in Bhutan. By 2100, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nestimates that South Asian countries, including Bhutan, will experience an increase in average \ntemperatures\u2014with rises in daily minimum and maximum temperatures\u2014mostly taking place at \nhigher altitudes. A 5% decrease in precipitation is expected during the dry season, and an 11% \nincrease is projected during the wet season in the long term.3 \n \n4.  Water stress. Decreased precipitation during the dry season, caused by climate change \nand lack of water management resources, will continue to result in water shortages in rural \nfarms.4 This will affect both agricultural yields and the quality of crops. As such, water shortage \nis a major cause of food insecurity. Climate adaptation strategies to address the risk of water \nshortage include the development of drought-resistant crops, rainwater harvesting, and efficient \nirrigation methods (such as drip and sprinkler irrigation footnote 3). \n \n5.  Landslides. Higher temperatures will increase the risk of glacial lake outburst floods and \nincreased precipitation during the wet season will cause more floods. Floods typically lead to \nlandslides, given Bhutan\u2019s steep geographic terrain. With the exception of a few wide valleys, \nagricultural lands in most parts are located on slopes. Assessment indicates that 31% of the \nagriculture land is located on slopes of more than 50 degrees, which are particularly prone to \nlandslides (footnote 4). Landslides have a devastating effect on farmers\u2019 livelihoods, as they \ncommonly result in the loss of standing crops, but can also prevent access to land for years. \nSloping agriculture land crops and technology can address the increased risk of landslides \ncaused by climate change (footnote 3).  \n \n6.  Changes in agroclimatic conditions. Climate change also poses the risks of change in \ncrop diversity, delayed sowing with shifting seasons, loss of soil fertility because of erosion and \nloss of nutrients owing to seepage, and increased risk from existing and new diseases and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 August 2015. \n2  ADB. 2015.

Rice-growing areas will also be heavily affected and, with the possibility of increasing \ntemperature, agro-ecological zones are expected to shift northward and to higher altitudes \n(footnote 3). \n \n7.  Impacts on hazelnut farmers. Hazelnut is a climate-resilient crop, as it needs less \nwater than annual crops. MHV will help farmers plant trees on degraded or fallow land, thus \ncontributing to soil retention (reduced risk of landslides) and watershed stability (reduced risk of \nflooding).  Hazelnut,  however,  is  also  exposed  to  climate  change.  Milder  winters  lower  the \nnumber of chill hours accumulated, and are predicted to have a negative effect on hazelnut \nyields, in addition to the negative impact of water stress.5 The TA will increase farmers\u2019 climate \nresilience at each step of the value chain through (i) improved irrigation and water storage, \n(ii) integrated  pest  management,  (iii)  improved  harvest  and  post-harvest  management, \n(iv) improved  access  to  information  through  smartphone  applications,  (v)  sharing  of  best \npractices  among  farmers,  (vi)  introduction  of  microclimate  adaptation  strategies,  and \n(vii) research and development into new crop varieties (Table). \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n8.  The TA shares the same impacts as the equity investment project: (i) agriculture gross \ndomestic  product  and  exports  boosted,  (ii)  private  sector  agribusiness  developed,  and \n(iii) poverty reduced in dzongkhags (districts) with poverty levels above the national average. \nThe outcome will be production of hazelnuts by smallholder farmers based on climate-resilient \nfarming practices ramped up.6  \n \n9.  The TA and the equity investment project are consistent with several of the performance \nindicators  for  climate  adaptation  projects  included  in  the  Contribution  Arrangement  for  the \nCanadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia (which will be funding the TA):7 \n(i)  Private sector investment addressing an identified vulnerability to climate \nchange. MHV will invest $14.8 million in climate-resilient hazelnut trees that will \nbe handed over to 15,000 smallholder farmers for free, and farmers will invest in \nequipment to grow and harvest the trees. \n(ii)  Number  of  hectares  of  land  under  climate-resilient  conservation, \nrehabilitation, or sustainable management. Hazelnut trees will be planted on \nat least 6,500 hectares of previously fallow or degraded land.  \n(iii)  Number of communities and farmers with access to improved information \nto make climate-resilient choices in agriculture. Training in climate-resilient \nfarming practices will be provided to at least 11,000 farmers and information \nsharing through farmer-instructors will be supported in at least 400 communities.   \nPlease refer to the different TA output indicators in the Table and in the design \nand monitoring framework of the TA (Appendix 1). \n(iv)  Number of employees (gender-disaggregated) employed. MHV\u2019s workforce \nwill increase from 500 in 2014 to 1,000 in 2020, including at least 50% women. \n                                                \n5  B. Ustaoglu and M. Karaca. 2014.

Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,300,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by the \nCanadian  Climate  Fund  for  the  Private  Sector  in  Asia  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB. MHV will provide in-kind contributions in the form \nof staff time, domestic transportation, office and housing accommodation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  MHV will be the recipient of the TA. MHV is best positioned to coordinate the work of the \nconsulting firm and share learning with farmers, the government, and other stakeholders in \nBhutan. Because of MHV\u2019s contract farming model, the company has a direct relationship with \nfarmers and will ensure that they fully benefit from the TA. The interests of MHV and the farmers \nare completely aligned in relation to the TA outcome, since MHV needs a sustainable supply of \nquality hazelnuts. In addition, MHV has the financial capacity to provide the required in-kind \ncontributions and ensure successful implementation of the TA. By the end of 2014, MHV\u2019s \nshareholders had invested $10.7 million in the company. With this investment, MHV had helped \nabout 5,000 smallholder farmers plant 2.5 million hazelnut trees. ADB\u2019s $3.0 million equity \ninvestment is part of the company\u2019s $14.8 million expansion plan that will enable it to reach \n15,000 farmers and 10 million trees.8  \n \n13.  MHV and ADB have agreed to the terms of a draft TA implementation agreement. The \ndraft agreement sets out the outcome and outputs of the TA, the amount of financing to be \nprovided by ADB, the terms of reference of the consulting firm to be appointed, the proposed \nbudget, and a realistic implementation timetable. \n \n14.  The TA will be carried out by a consulting firm to be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). For efficiency, the \nconsulting firm  is  expected to  bid for  the  entire  package  of  consulting services  required.9 \nQuality-  and  cost-based  selection  will  be  used,  with  80:20  weighting,  and  a  full  technical \nproposal. Advance action for the recruitment of the consulting firm will be taken. \n \n15.  The consulting firm will be in charge of procuring the equipment required for the TA. The \ntype of equipment for each output is in Appendix 2. Given the small size of each equipment \npackage (less than $100,000), the method of procurement will be shopping (as opposed to \ninternational or national competitive bidding). The consulting firm will be required to receive \nquotes from at least three different suppliers preapproved by ADB and MHV for each type of \nequipment. Upon TA completion, the equipment will be turned over to its users (either MHV or \nthe farmers). \n \n16.  ADB and MHV will form a TA task force comprising representatives from ADB and MHV, \nas well as staff from the consulting firm to be hired. The task force will meet regularly to assess \nthe progress of the assistance. All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA is expected to start in July 2016 and be completed by June 2019.   \n \n                                                \n8  Please refer to the FAST Report (footnote 2) for more background on MHV, its capabilities, and its business plan. \n9  Subcontracting will be permitted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time) (para. 1.14), as it would allow different consulting firms to leverage and combine their \nareas of expertise. \n ", "6 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.

Output 1: Affordable water storage and irrigation solutions designed and pilot \ntested. Farmers in Bhutan on south-facing slopes and in areas affected by rain shadows are \nprone to periods of moisture stress and drought-like conditions. Villages in such areas already \nface challenges securing sufficient drinking water during certain months of the year. Climate \nchange is predicted to increase mean average temperatures; it will lead to higher temperature \npeaks as well as milder winters. Precipitation patterns are also predicted to become more erratic, \nwith later arrival of rains, geographical shifts in rainfall distribution, and drier winters.1 Drier \nwarmer winters will increase water stress in hazelnut orchards, leading to slower establishment \nand reduced crop yields, mainly as a result of ineffective flowering and pollination.2 The design \nand pilot testing of affordable water storage and capture and irrigation solutions will increase the \nresilience of farming communities to drought, and increase the productivity of hazelnut orchards \nand farming lands more generally. \n \n2.  Output 1 will be delivered by the following consultants:  \n(i)  Design engineer (international, 6 person-months). The design engineer will be \nresponsible for the technical development of mechanisms and devices for water \ncapture, water storage, and field irrigation. \n(ii)  Business consultant (international, 6 person-months). The business consultant \nwill work on optimizing the economic efficacy of the water collection, storage, and \nirrigation mechanisms\u2014helping to create replicable, efficient systems. \n(iii)  Professional  outreach  trainer (regional, 6 person-months, intermittent). The \nprofessional outreach trainer will be in charge of transferring all best practices \nand knowledge to hazelnut growers to optimize their harvest. \n(iv)  Irrigation  technician  (regional,  4  person-months,  intermittent).  The  irrigation \ntechnician will be in charge of transferring knowledge on best practices for the \noperation and maintenance of small-scale irrigation schemes to hazelnut growers. \n \n3.  Output 1 key activities in the terms of reference (TOR) will include assessing needs, \nselecting and/or designing solutions for water storage and collection and irrigation, developing \ntraining  materials  and  implementing  training  for  farmers  and  extension  staff  of  Mountain \nHazelnut Venture Private Limited (MHV) in the construction and operation of selected systems, \nand performing follow-up monitoring and evaluation. \n \n4.  Output  2:  Training  in  integrated  pest  management  delivered.  Integrated  pest \nmanagement (IPM) techniques are generally poorly understood by farmers in Bhutan. Besides, \nhazelnut is a new crop and some pests have yet to emerge. Farmers need to adapt their IPM \nstrategies to the evolving pest threat caused by climate change. Outbreak of pests and diseases \nin the fields and storage facilities where they were previously unknown has been identified as \none of the climate change vulnerabilities of Bhutan\u2019s agriculture sector (footnote 1). Farmer \ntraining programs in hazelnut IPM techniques will enable new techniques to be adopted more \nrapidly, allow more sustainable pest management, and increase yields and nut quality while \nminimizing unnecessary environmental impacts. \n \n5.  Output 2 will be delivered by the following consultants: \n(i)  Plant pathologist (international, 3 person-months). The plant pathologist will be \nresponsible for developing IPM strategies suitable for hazelnut growers in Bhutan. \n                                                \n1  Government of Bhutan. 2009.

Output 3: Technical assistance and training in harvest and post-harvest solutions \nprovided.  Hazelnuts  are  a  new  crop  for  Bhutanese  farmers,  and  no  farmers  have  any \nharvesting experience with this crop. Technical assistance (TA) and training for farmers and \ncommunities will reduce post-harvest losses, improve quality, and develop labor-saving tools \nand methods from harvest through to delivery at a collection center. Such outputs will increase \nthe  quantity  of  saleable  nuts,  increase  farmer  incomes,  and  improve  overall  value  chain \nefficiency. More unpredictable and off-season rains caused by climate change require faster \nharvesting, and technologies need to be put in place to protect harvested nuts from the rain \n(humidity increases the risk of bacterial contamination). The TA will provide training and pilot \ntechnologies to help farmers save time, meet MHV quality standards, and prepare to cope with \nweather risks. \n \n8.  Output 3 will be delivered by the following consultants: \n(i)  Design engineer (international, 6 person-months). The design engineer will be \nresponsible for the technical development of drying and de-husking mechanisms \nas well as village and farm storage mechanisms. \n(ii)  Business consultant (international, 6 person-months). The business consultant \nwill  work  on  optimizing  the  economic  efficacy  of  drying  and  de-husking \nmechanisms as well as village and farm storage mechanisms\u2014helping to create \nreplicable, efficient machines. \n(iii)  Professional  outreach  trainer (regional, 5 person-months, intermittent). The \nprofessional outreach trainer will be in charge of transferring all best practices \nand knowledge to hazelnut growers to optimize their harvest. \n \n9.  Output 3 key activities in the TOR will include designing affordable harvest and post-\nharvest solutions for hazelnut growers, including village and farm storage solutions, prototyping, \npilot demonstrations, and training for solutions with farmers. \n \n10.  Output  4:  Smartphone  applications  to  improve  farmers\u2019  access  to  extension \nadvice  developed. With the help of external consultants, MHV has developed a scalable \nremote management and traceability (RMT) system for its extension service, using a collection \nof  open  source  tools.  Building  on  this  to  develop  a  dedicated,  functional,  user-friendly \napplication to be accessed by extension agents and farmers would improve farmers\u2019 ability to \nreceive  real-time  extension  advice,  weather  reports,  and  other  information.  Such  a  tool, \ncombined with support from extension agents, would give farmers access to technical advice \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n \n \nand  information  to  improve  orchard  management,  yields,  and  incomes;  and  provide  more \ninformed  climate  change  adaption  strategies.  The  applications  would  also  be  generally \napplicable as a modular, portable system for other agriculture projects, in the public and private \nsectors, both in Bhutan and worldwide. Bhutan has 3G3 coverage in 26 towns spread across the \nentire project area. For rural areas, MHV estimates that 80% of households in the project area \nhave mobile phone coverage, which includes reasonable EDGE4 data connections at up to 128 \nkilobits per second. The current smartphone-based tools used by extension agents (which the \nTA is proposed to upgrade) are designed to work with slower rural data connections. The \nsoftware tools remain fully functional offline and are designed to optimize data transfers through \nperiodic syncing, incremental updates, and data compression. From 2015 to 2018, the 3G \nnetwork will be expanded in Bhutan to cover all population centers. The EDGE connections will \nalso be expanded to cover more than 95% of rural households. \n \n11.  Output 4 will be delivered by the following consultants:  \n(i)  Software  design  engineer  (international,  2  person-months).  The  software \ndesign engineer will be responsible for the development of a set of detailed \nsoftware design specifications for smartphone applications and backend services \nappropriate for use by local extension agents and hazelnut growers. \n(ii)  Software development engineer (international, 2 person-months). The software \ndevelopment  engineer  will  work  on  optimizing  the  efficacy  of  the  software \ndesigns, backend software services, and information technology infrastructure \nrequirements\u2014helping to create replicable, portable, and reusable solutions to \nthe design challenges. \n(iii)  Professional  software  trainer (regional, 7 person-months). The professional \nsoftware trainer will be in charge of transferring knowledge to hazelnut growers, \nextension agents, and field monitors to maximize the utility of the information and \nservices provided through the developed software services. \n \n12.  Output 4 key activities in the TOR will include assessing MHV\u2019s current RMT system and \nperforming gap analysis for end-users\u2019 needs; and creating, implementing, and disseminating \ninformation on and pilot testing a software product with design specifications for (i) expanded \nfunctionality  to  make  the  RMT  system  generally  applicable  to  agriculture  projects  and \nresponsive to farmers\u2019 diverse needs, (ii) easily adding extra functionality, and (iii) upgrading \nmobile application support for a wider range of devices. \n \n13.  Output 5: Farmer-to-farmer best practice exchanges facilitated. Farmers living in \nscattered remote locations, with limited connectivity, have few opportunities to learn from their \npeers or learn best practices in the field. Hazelnuts are a new crop in Bhutan, so they cannot \ndraw upon a local knowledge base. Facilitating farmer-to-farmer best practice exchanges is \ncritical to speeding up the adaptation of the company\u2019s innovation and guidance, which will \nimprove orchard management, yields, and, by extension, farmers\u2019 incomes. Such practices will \nalso aid in transferring climate change adaptation strategies. MHV has a professional extension \nnetwork but, with additional investment and training, its impact could be magnified, and best \npractices more rapidly adopted, shared, and made more inclusive. \n \n14.  Output 5 will be delivered by the following consultants: \n                                                \n3  3G is the third generation mobile communications standard that allows cell phones, computers, and other portable \nelectronic devices to access the Internet wirelessly. \n4  Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) is a mobile communications technology that allows improved data \ntransmission rates as an extension of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology. \n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \n(i)  Agriculture  consultant  (international,  4  person-months).  The  agriculture \nconsultant will work on identifying the regions and areas where farmers, who \nneed additional skills and experience in effectively managing their crops, can \nlearn from the best practices of growers who are more effective. \n(ii)  Professional outreach trainer (regional, 11 person-months, intermittent). The \nprofessional outreach trainer will be in charge of organizing and facilitating the \ntransfer  of  best  practices  and  experience  between  hazelnut growers  so  that \ninexperienced growers learn new concepts rapidly. \n \n15.  Output  5 key  activities  in  the TOR  will  include  identifying  target groups  of farming \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  and  young,  inexperienced  farmers  who  would  benefit from \nengagement with more experienced farmers or from exchanging ideas; taking farmer groups on \nstudy tours to different hazelnut-growing regions to meet more experienced farmers and see \nmore mature orchards; showcasing best practices of outstanding hazelnut farmers, through \ngroup meetings and farmer videos in their own fields and languages; establishing regional \noffices  where  farmers  can  access  information  and  resources  about  hazelnuts,  pest \nmanagement, support technologies, and new initiatives shared by other farmers; organizing \nregional hazelnut workshops where farmers can share their experiences and learning with other \nfarmers from outside their normal social group; collecting and disseminating farmers\u2019 innovative \nideas and solutions to common problems so they can be replicated by other farmers; training \nfarmer leaders on organizing farmer group activities, workshops, and farmer collaborations; \nsetting up trials and evaluations of farmer best practices in other regions; and sharing learning \nand best practices with extension services of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests.  \n \n16.  Output 6: Climate station network to improve adaptation strategies expanded. In \naddition to the negative impacts on water availability and pollination affecting crop yield, climate \nchange could lead to increased harvesting and post-harvest costs as a result of higher and \nmore intense rainfall in the harvesting season. Harvest timings could also shift because of \nearlier flowering, faster accumulation of heat units, and increased precipitation. Such changes \ncould have significant consequences for harvest and logistical planning. Additionally, because of \nits topography, Bhutan has a multitude of microclimates which are poorly understood. Even less \nwell  understood  are  the  possible  effects  of  climate  change  on  these  microclimates.  More \ndetailed climate data on these microclimates from an expanded climate monitoring network \nwould enable improved variety selection and climate change adaptation. More granular climate \ndata would also enable analytical techniques, such as predictive yield models, to be developed \nfor hazelnuts. This will aid harvest planning and logistics, and improve the efficiency and climate \nresilience of the hazelnut value chain. Improvement to the weather forecasting network and \nfarmer advisory system was identified as an area that could assist farmer production decisions \nin Bhutan and which is a current constraint to climate change adaptation (footnote 1). \n \n17.  Output 6 will be delivered by the following consultants: \n(i)  Climate change and agriculture consultant (international, 4 person-months, \nintermittent). The consultant will perform gap analysis on the climate station \nnetwork with the aim of creating comprehensive and cost-effective coverage of \nthe hazelnut-growing areas and microclimatic zones in Bhutan. In coordination \nwith  a  software  engineer, the  consultant  will  collate  available  data  sets  and \ndesign a user-friendly set of climate adaption tools for use by farmers. The \nconsultant will guide a national consultant to collect phenotypic data and connect \nclimate data sets to create a harvest and yield prediction model. The model will \nassist farmers in harvest planning and financial management of their farms, and \nwill augment the tools used by MHV planning and logistics teams. \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \n \n \n(ii)  Agriculture consultant (regional, 9 person-months, intermittent). The agriculture \nconsultant will work on the collection of phenotypic data for hazelnut trees across \nBhutan, and will work with the international consultant to connect the phenotype \ndata with climate data sets to create a harvest and yield prediction model. \n(iii)  Software  design  and  development  engineer  (regional,  3  person-months, \nintermittent). The software design and development engineer will be responsible \nfor designing and developing of a set of software tools and user interfaces to \nprovide access to the climate data and harvest-forecasting tools developed by \nthe agriculture consultants. These tools need to be designed such that they are \nappropriate for use by local extension agents and hazelnut growers. \n \n18.  Output  6  key  activities  in  the  TOR  will  include  expanding  MHV\u2019s  current  climate \nmonitoring network, integrating the government\u2019s climate data set, developing modeling tools \nuseable by all stakeholders that can improve variety selection and climate change adaption \nstrategies, building a hazelnut yield model to improve MHV\u2019s aggregation and marketing and \nsales planning, designing monitoring systems to use hazelnuts and other crops as long-term \nindicators of the effects of climate change on the Himalayas, and developing tools to ensure that \nthe results of climate monitoring are shared widely with all stakeholders.  \n \n19.  Output 7: Capacity for selective breeding programs for climate resilience built. \nMHV has selected hazelnut varieties that thrive in most environmental conditions and have \nbeen used before as low-risk choices to plant in new areas. Climate change, however, could \nnecessitate developing new varieties. Hazelnut requires about 1,000 chill hours in the winter \nmonths to trigger effective flowering and pollination. Climate change-induced milder winters will \naccumulate fewer chill hours, which is predicted to have a negative effect on hazelnut yields, in \naddition to the negative impact of water stress.5 Capacity building in MHV\u2019s nascent selective \nbreeding and in-country multiplication programs from hazelnut selective breeding experts will \nenable climate-resilient varieties (i.e., drought-tolerant, with a lower chill hour requirement) to be \ndeveloped. Improved varieties would also enable Bhutan\u2019s wide range of microclimate niches to \nbe filled more effectively. These would be distributed to farmers to optimize the yields and \nfarmer incomes, and expand the planting area range (higher and lower altitudes). This will \nextend the positive outcomes to a greater number of farmers and increase climate change \nadaptive capacity for the hazelnut value chain. \n \n20.  Hazelnut selective breeding consultant (international, 3 person-months, intermittent). \nOutput 7 will be delivered by a hazelnut selective breeding consultant, who will prepare a gap \nanalysis of the current selective breeding and multiplication orchards with the goal of preparing \nan action plan and training program that will develop high-yielding climate change-resilient \nvarieties of hazelnuts with extended range that can be multiplied in country for distribution to \nfarmers. \n \n21.  Output 7 key activities in the TOR will include delivering international selective breeding \nexpertise capacity building and training; preparing an action plan to expand and intensify the \nselective  breeding  program  and  in-country  multiplication  capacity;  in  particular  (i)  suitable \nimports of genetic material to widen genetic diversity, (ii) crossbreeding with native hazelnut \nspecies,  and  (iii)  selection  and  distribution  of  optimized  varieties  for  microclimate  niches, \nresilience to climate change, and extension of range. \n \n                                                \n5  B.
