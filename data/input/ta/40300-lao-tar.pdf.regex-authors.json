The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) aims to achieve \neconomic  growth,  reduce  poverty,  and  advance  from  its  least-developed-country  status  by \n2020. The National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) was approved by the \nNational Assembly of the Lao PDR in October 2003. The NGPES provides a broad strategic \nframework from which future growth and poverty reduction programs will be developed and \nimplemented. The NGPES emphasizes the need for capacity building relating to public financial \nmanagement (PFM) at all levels of public administration.1  \n \n2.  The  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  (the  Government)  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide the proposed technical assistance (TA)2  to support the \nLao PDR in improving its PFM. The proposed TA is included in ADB\u2019s Lao PDR: Country \nStrategy  and  Program  2007\u20132011,  which  emphasizes  good  governance  as  one  of  three \nstrategic pillars of development assistance to the country. A fact-finding mission was fielded to \nVientiane from 30 April to 2 May 2007. The mission and representatives from the Government \nheld  discussions  and  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objective,  scope,  cost,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  of  the  TA.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The  2007  Public  Expenditure  Review  and  Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment3  (PER), \njointly undertaken by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, ADB, and the European \nCommission, noted that improving PFM and public expenditure policy will be critical to the key \nchallenge of achieving the country\u2019s socially inclusive development goals laid out in the sixth \nNational Socio\u2212Economic Development Plan and the NGPES. The Government has made \nprogress in advancing the PFM  development agenda since 2002. In November 2005, the \nGovernment  approved  a  five-year  Public  Expenditure  Management  Strengthening  Program \n(PEMSP), which constitutes a cohesive framework addressing weaknesses in (i) fiscal planning \nand budget preparation; (ii) budget execution, accounting, and financial reporting; (iii) local \ngovernment financial management; (iv) financial legislation and regulatory frameworks; and (v) \ntechnical  capacity.  Recognizing  that  building  sound  PFM  systems  requires  sustained \ndevelopment  over  the  medium-to-long  term,  external  partner  agencies  have  provided \ncoordinated assistance to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in the implementation of PEMSP.4 \n \n4.  The  2007  PER  noted  that  PEMSP  pays  insufficient  attention  to  public  financial \naccountability and the critical role that an independent supreme audit institution could play in \nensuring good governance. This conclusion is underscored by the Nam Theun 2 Revenue \nManagement Arrangements (NT2 RMA), which require the State Audit Organization (SAO) to \npublish each year, starting from FY 2009, (i) an audit opinion of the statement of receipts and \ntransfers of the NT2 revenue account, and (ii) an audit opinion covering the financial statements \n                                                 \n1  See also National Round Table Process Steering Committee. 2004.

Priority Areas for Governance \nReform: A Policy Paper of the Government of Lao PDR on Governance Issues. Vientiane.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 April 2007. \n3   World Bank. 2007. Lao PDR Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment. Washington, DC. \n4  For example, ADB provides advisory TA for the development and implementation (on a pilot basis) of medium-term \nfiscal and expenditure frameworks to improve fiscal planning. The World Bank is assisting the Government in \ndeveloping and moving towards a chart of accounts that is consistent with government financial statistics standards \nand provides advisory assistance in addressing the challenges in central-provincial fiscal relations. The European \nCommission lends technical support for addressing treasury cash management issues and strengthening internal \ncontrols. \n ", "2 \nof  eligible  programs,  and  addressing  compliance  with  (a)  the  Government\u2019s  financial \nmanagement and procurement procedures, and that (b) NT2 funds have been used for the \npurposes of eligible programs.5   \n \n5.  Accounting and Financial Reporting. ADB has provided technical assistance to the \nMOF for the development of (i) enhanced accounting regulations and procedures that are \naligned with international good practice standards of reporting; and (ii) a government financial \ninformation system (GFIS) that is (a) capable of capturing revenue and recurrent expenditure \ndata, (b) providing on-line access to budget targets/allocations and status of funds availability, \n(c) tracking accounts payable, and (d) producing related reports.6 ADB\u2019s assistance led to \nimplementation of the new accounting procedures and GFIS in 2005 across all 40 line ministries \nand government agencies and 17 provinces. This was the first time automation had been used \non such a wide scale in Lao PDR\u2019s PFM reform agenda. Line ministries and provincial offices \nhave transitioned to the GFIS from manual books of accounts, but there is a need to deepen \ntechnical knowledge and extend the use of the GFIS. Given the demonstrated success in \nshifting to an automated system, MOF is now keen to start implementing the GFIS on a pilot \nbasis in more progressive districts.  \n \n6.  The Government does not as yet publish consolidated financial statements. A Financial \nStatement Committee was formed by the minister of finance in early 2007, comprising the \nvarious MOF departments, led by the Department of Accounting. The PEMSP aims to prepare, \non a pilot basis, the consolidated annual statements for FY 2009. Although some advisory \nassistance was provided by ADB to MOF in 2006 with respect to preparing financial statements, \ncontinued assistance is required in light of the recently approved government financial statistics \n(GFS) compatible chart of accounts and the new Budget Law, passed by the National Assembly \nin December 2006. \n \n7.  Internal Audit. To enable sustained progress towards sound PFM, the currently limited \ninspection function within MOF\u2019s Department of Inspection needs to be expanded into a broader \ninternal audit and control function. Most inspection staff lack the needed technical background \non accounting and auditing, and the very low English language proficiency of government staff \nmakes it difficult for them to assimilate concepts of international good practice standards shared \nby external partner agencies. PEMSP plans to initiate publication of a summary report on the \nresults  of  internal  audits  by  FY  2009.  Through  TA  4180  which  focused  on  enhancing \ngovernment  accounting  regulations  and  procedures,  ADB  began  a  policy  dialogue  and \nincreased awareness of the importance of undertaking reviews of internal control systems in \ngovernment  agencies.  A  set  of  draft  internal  audit  regulations,  an  internal  audit  mandate, \ninternal control policy statement, 5-year strategic action plan, code of ethics, internal auditing \nstandards, and proposed organization structure and job descriptions were produced in 2006 for \nconsideration by MOF. The Government\u2019s commitment to PEMSP outcomes and the ambitious \ntimelines will require further ADB support for implementing the internal audit function. \n \n8.  Independent  State  Audit  Function.  The  State  Audit  Organization  (SAO)  was \nestablished in 1998 through a decree by the prime minister, making it a unit of the Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Office.  There  has  been  encouraging  progress  in  strengthening  the  organization \nfollowing the appointment of new leadership in SAO in June 2006. The Audit Law was passed \nby  the  National  Assembly  in  July  2006  which  will  strengthen  the  effectiveness  and \n                                                 \n5  Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project: Implementation Policy Framework, issued by the Deputy Prime Minister of the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to ADB, 7 March 2005.  \n6  ADB. 2003.

Continued technical support to SAO will be required to provide advice \nin drafting implementing decrees for the Audit Law. Government support to SAO is reflected by \na staff increase of 12 (from 35 to 47) since June 2006. This will further increase to a staffing \nstrength of 57 by end 2007. However, most SAO staff lack a basic accounting and auditing \ntechnical background, and English language proficiency remains poor.  \n \n9.  The  NT2  RMA  requires  that  SAO  undergo  audit  peer  review  by  an  International \nAssociation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) member starting in 2006, in FY 2009 (or \nthe first year of NT2 revenue flows), and every three years thereafter.7 The SAO has committed \nto implementing the first audit peer review in 2007. In light of the passing of the first Audit Law \nand the 2006 Budget Law, areas for ADB assistance will include revising the SAO\u2019s 5-year \nstrategic plan and audit manuals, continued training and capacity building, and assistance in \nstrengthening areas of weaknesses that will be identified in the audit peer review.8     \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  contribute  to  improved  public  financial  accountability  and \ntransparency  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  development  and  poverty  reduction  policy \nobjectives. The TA outcome will be (i) improved quality of reporting and internal control, and (ii) \nimproved effective state audit oversight of public finances and expenditures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Improving the Quality of Reporting and Internal Control. The first component of the \nTA will support the strengthening of the accounting and internal audit functions of MOF. The \ngovernment accounting regulations and procedures will be revised to include the new features \nof the Budget Law and the new GFS-compatible chart of accounts. The GFIS and accounting \nregulations  and  procedures  will  be  introduced  and  implemented  in  the  38  districts  of  the \nprovinces  of  Luang  Prabang,  Savannakhet,  and  Champassak,  and  Vientiane  Municipality. \nCapacity development workshops are to be held in all 40 line ministries/government agencies \nand 17 provincial offices, to deepen their technical capacity and provide continuous feedback for \nenhancing the system and regulations. The TA will also assist in developing a strategy for \nproducing annual consolidated government financial statements, including a methodology and \noperating guidelines. Once approved by MOF, the TA will assist MOF in pilot testing preparation \nof the first set of consolidated financial statements. Computer equipment will be provided to the \nfinance offices of the pilot districts, the provincial governor\u2019s offices, the cabinet offices of the \nline ministries, government agencies and prime minister\u2019s office, and the MOF Department of \nAccounting to support continued expansion of GFIS information technology (IT) infrastructure. \n \n12.  The TA will conduct training workshops for internal auditors on internal audit techniques, \nfundamentals of accounting and auditing, and the English language, and to create awareness of \n                                                 \n7  The SAO has selected the New Zealand Audit Office to do the first audit peer review.

Manila. The TA was implemented from 2003\u22122006 and provided assistance in drafting the \nAudit Law. Outputs included a 5-year strategic plan and five audit manuals (for audits of state-owned enterprises, \ndonor-funded projects, government financial statements, Bank of the Lao PDR, and state-owned commercial \nbanks). \n ", "4 \nthe  internal  audit  functions.  It  will  provide  support  to  MOF  in  expanding  the  inspection \ndepartment\u2019s functions to include internal audits. The set of draft internal audit strategic plans, \nmanuals,  policy  statements,  code  of  ethics,  and  proposed  organizational  structure  will  be \nrevised in consideration of the 2006 Budget Law and GFS-compatible chart of accounts. Some \ncomputer and office equipment will be provided to augment inspection department capabilities \nand enable online access to PEMSP databases and the GFIS. \n \n13.  Improving Effective Independent State Audit. The second component of the TA is \naimed at strengthening SAO capacity. SAO\u2019s law committee will lead the preparation of the draft \nimplementing decrees of the July 2007 Audit Law. The TA will assist SAO by providing advice \non the drafting of implementing decrees, based on international good practice standards. It will \nalso carry out nationwide workshops on the Audit Law and implementing decrees to better \nexplain  their  application.  The  2007  INTOSAI  audit  peer  review  will  provide  the  baseline \ninformation on the capacity of SAO and will recommend areas for improvement. The TA will \nprovide the necessary support to SAO while it undergoes its first-ever peer review and will \ndevelop training programs to assist SAO in (i) increasing its capacity, (ii) meeting international \nauditing standards, and (iii) ensuring its readiness for the succeeding INTOSAI reviews. The 5-\nyear strategic plan and set of five audit manuals will be revised to take into account the 2006 \nBudget Law and the 2007 Audit Law. In consultation with stakeholders, new audit manuals for \nperformance, procurement, and budget audits will be produced for implementation by SAO. \nCapacity building activities will include training on computer-aided audit procedures, practical \napplication of the audit manuals, the English language, and fundamentals of public accounting \nand auditing. Training will be in the form of classroom and on-the-job training. The TA will \nsupport publication and distribution of the Audit Law and its implementing decrees, and provide \nneeded equipment (e.g., computers, printers, and photocopy machines) as SAO expands its \norganization, work programs and linkages to the national databases. The TA will also support \nthe participation of SAO in at least one international conference of state audit institutions to \nfacilitate exchange of knowledge on international best practices. \n \n14.  All activities will be predicated on the requisite review and revision of existing systems, \nregulations,  and  processes in  light  of  the 2006  Budget Law,  the  GFS-compatible  chart  of \naccounts,  and  the  2007  Audit  Law  and  its  implementing  decrees.  Close  consultation  with \nstakeholders  such  as  the  different  ministries,  provincial  governments,  and  relevant  MOF \ndepartments will be held through participatory workshops, to build consensus and government \nownership of the TA outputs. There will also be close coordination during TA implementation \nwith external partner agencies involved in the broader PFM development agenda in Lao PDR. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,000,000. The Government has requested \nADB finance $850,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding  program.  The  Government  will  provide  in-kind  contribution  equivalent  to  $150,000 \nthrough the provision of counterpart staff, office space and utilities, administrative services, and \nphysical facilities. Appendix 2 gives the details of cost estimates and the financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Department of Accounting of MOF will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the first \ncomponent of the TA. The Department of Inspection will be an implementing agency. The TA \nwill use the existing PEMSP coordination mechanisms to facilitate review of implementation \n ", "    5\nprogress of component 1 within the context of the PEMSP.9 SAO will be the EA for the second \ncomponent. Progress reports to the auditor general will help ensure the timely implementation of \ncomponent 2 of the TA. Each EA will assign a project director of senior stature, with two part-\ntime counterpart staff to assist in coordination.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months from October 2007 to June 2009, and will \nrequire four international consultants over 26.5 person-months and three national consultants \nover  35  person\u2013months,  working  intermittently.  There  will  be  two  teams  of  consultants  to \nimplement the two components, with a team leader for each component reporting to ADB and \ntheir  respective  EAs.  Component  1  consultants  comprise  an  international  accounting  and \ninternal  audit  specialist  (team  leader,  4  person-months),  international  accounting  training \nspecialist (10 person-months), and an international audit training specialist (3 person months). \nComponent 2 consultants comprise an international state audit specialist (team leader, 2.5 \nperson-months) and an international audit training specialist (7 person months). It is envisaged \nto  use  the  same  international  audit  training  specialist  for  components  1  and  2  to  ensure \nconsistency of training programs, as internal and state audit functions are complementary in \nimproving transparency and accountability. National consultants for component 1 comprise a \nnational audit specialist and two national software development/training specialists, who will \nrender 35 person\u2013months of service. The consultant teams will produce various reports in both \nEnglish and Lao, as outlined in their terms of reference, each of which will be discussed in \ntripartite meetings.  \n \n18.  The consultants will be engaged through a firm following the quality- and cost-based \nselection process, and the simplified technical proposal will be used. The firm will provide the \noverall project management oversight over the two components of the TA. Both team leaders, \nthrough the firm, will report to ADB and the Government. There will be no reallocation of TA \nfunds between TA components 1 and 2 without prior discussion and consent of the Government \nand ADB. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). All procurement under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from time to time) and \nthe  international  training  specialists  will  assist  to  ensure  that  procurement  guidelines  are \nfollowed.  The  consultant  terms  of  reference are  in  Appendix  3.  Various  workshops  at  the \ncentral, provincial, and district offices will be held to encourage participatory discussions and to \nincrease capacity of government staff. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao PDR for Improved Public Financial Management Systems, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n9  A PEMSP Program Steering Committee is chaired by the Vice Minister of Finance with representatives of the \nrelevant MOF departments. It reviews progress and approves MOF departments\u2019 work programs. A PEMSP \nProgram Coordination Committee (chaired by the Minister of Finance) meets twice a year to update the PEMSP in \nline with progress in implementation, the Government\u2019s policy directives and external funding support. Monitoring \nreports are produced on a semiannual basis. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK a \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved public financial  \u2022  Institutional systems  \u2022  Review successive years\u2019  \u2022  Continued high-level \naccountability and  of public financial  published budgets,  commitment by the \ntransparency in support of  management  published consolidated  Government to \nthe Government\u2019s  strengthened over the  government financial  effective Public \ndevelopment and poverty  period of 2008\u22122010  statements, and National  Financial \nreduction policy objectives   \u2022  Progress toward  Growth and Poverty  Management \n  international public  Eradication Strategy  Systems \nfinancial management  documents   \ngood practice    Risk \nstandards over the  \u2022  Changes in \nperiod of 2008\u22122010  leadership and shifts \n  in prioritization and \nvision of Government  \n \nOutcome       Assumption \nImproved quality of  \u2022  At least 90% of  \u2022  Public Expenditure  \u2022  Continued \nreporting and internal  transactions captured  Review of FY2009  commitment by MOF \ncontrol  by GFIS, with 20%  \u2022  MOF periodic reporting  to strengthening \n  decrease in margin of  and monitoring of  reporting and internal \nImproved effective state  error at end of TA  PEMSP progress (refer  audit functions. \naudit oversight of public  \u2022  Timely provision of  to footnote 9 of TA paper)  \u2022  Continued \nfinances and expenditures  reliable consolidated    commitment by the \n  reports (from the pilot    National Assembly to \npreparation) of FY    the independent \n2009    character of SAO \n\u2022  Coverage of SAO  \u2022  INTOSAI audit peer   \naudits increased by  reviews of 2007 and   Risk \n10% at end of TA  2009  \u2022  Changes in \n\u2022  At least 25% of the  leadership and staff of \nweaknesses identified  MOF and SAO \nby the INTOSAI peer   \nreview sufficiently \naddressed and \ncorrected by INTOSAI \naudit peer review by \n2009 \n \nOutputs      Assumption \nComponent 1  \u2022  New accounting  \u2022  Joint public expenditure  \u2022  Districts and \n1.
