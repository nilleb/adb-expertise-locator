An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nAssessment  and the summary  is a core appendix. \nProject  Description  The Project\u2019s goal is to sustain the productivity of PNG\u2019s valuable \ncoastal  fisheries  resources  while  reducing  the  poverty  level  of \n  coastal communities whose livelihoods depend on fisheries.  The \nProject will target major fish-landing areas and their surrounding \n  coastal communities in 4 of PNG\u2019s 14 maritime provinces. Fishing \nand employment related to fishing is a major source of income and \n  sustenance  for  most  households  in  the  target  communities.  The \nProject has two purposes: (i) sustain the fishing industry in each \n  target area with investments to improve the harbor facilities serving \nfishing  vessels,  passenger  boats,  and  local  fish  traders;  and  (ii)  \n \nimplement  sustainable  management  of  the  coastal  fisheries \nresources through approaches linking fishers and fish traders with \n \nthe commercial fish marketing chains. The Project will (i) construct a \nlongline wharf in Lae; (ii) develop capacity of provincial and local \n \ngovernments and other service providers through community-based \nfisheries  management  programs  in  the  target  areas;  (iii)  provide \n \nbasic social infrastructures such as jetties and associated landing \nfacilities, and transit houses and sanitation aimed at the personal \n \nsafety of women fish vendors and workers using the harbor facilities; \nand (iv) undertake an HIV/AIDS prevention campaign. \nRationale \nPNG has large fishery resources that are, not only underpinning  \nrecent growth in the commercial fishery sector, but also provide the \nlivelihood  for  the  coastal  communities  through  subsistence  and \nsmall-scale  fisheries.  The  investment  and  policy  regimes  in  the \nsector have improved in recent years and the National Fisheries \nAuthority (NFA), which is responsible for national fisheries, has been \nstrengthened  with  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB), leaving it in a much stronger position to both manage and \nmonitor the fisheries of the country. \nWhile  the  domestic  tuna  longline  fisheries  have  increased,  and  \nexpanded the export of fresh fish and other marine products, the \ndevelopment  of  small-scale  fisheries  is  constrained  by  high \noperational  costs,  notably  fuel.  Increasing  cash  needs  by  rural \npeople for basic needs like school fees have forced small-scale and \nsubsistence fishers to primarily target high-value species such as \nsea  cucumber  (beche-de-mer)  and  trochus  shells.  Consequently, \nmany of these stocks are now overfished and few alternative income \nopportunities are left.  ", "iv   \nAs  commercial  fisheries  have  developed  most  of  the  basic \ninfrastructure  and  related  services  needed  to  access  the  more \nlucrative  domestic  and  overseas  markets,  linking  small-scale \nfisheries to these centers can provide the basis for an economically \nviable small-scale fishery. This can be achieved by providing small-\nscale infrastructure such as jetties at or near commercial centers, \nthus creating the opportunities to obtain higher prices by exporting \nquality marine products to larger domestic cities and overseas. At \nthe same time, there is a need to stabilize exploitation at sustainable \nlevels and reverse the decline in some fisheries. Provincial and local \nadministrations, which are largely responsible for coastal resource \nmanagement, require appropriate skills, systems, and resources to \ncarry out this task in partnership with local communities. \nLack  of  basic  social  amenities,  a  general  lack  of  safety,  and \ndeclining  law  and  order  in  many  coastal  cities  are  issues  that \nnegatively affect women, who dominate small-scale fish trading and \nprocessing. Improved social infrastructure, including places to sleep, \nsanitation, and safety, must also be addressed if sustainability of \ncoastal fisheries is to be achieved.   \nObjectives and Scope  The Project will contribute to poverty reduction in rural areas by \nincreasing,  or  preventing  further  decline  of,  income  of  coastal \ncommunities. This will be done by promoting improved management \nof  resources  (including  in  those  area  currently  overfished,  or \nthreatened with overfishing) and by creating sustainable earning and \nemployment opportunities for coastal fishers by providing links to \nestablished commercial fishing centers.  \nThe Project will be undertaken in four selected provinces (Milne Bay, \nMorobe, New Ireland, and Western), each of which possesses a \nfavorable  blend  of  conditions,  namely:  availability  of  supporting \ninfrastructure,  relative  abundance  of  fish  resources,  potential  for \nincreased  value  from  small-scale  fishery,  and  proximity  to \ncommercial fishery centers. The Project has four main components: \n(i)  Fisheries  Management  Support.  Strengthen  the \ncapacity of fishery stakeholders and/or service providers \nat  provincial  levels  to  plan  and  implement,  provide \nappropriate information flows, improve the organization of \nfishery  stakeholders,  increase  necessary  research \ninitiatives, promote comanagement of marine resources, \nand undertake awareness training programs in HIV/AIDS \nprevention.  The  Project  will  also  provide  support  to \ninitiatives in other provinces, if required. \n(ii)  Longline  wharf.  Extend  the  longline  wharf  in  Lae  to \ncomplement the ongoing investment by the private sector, \nand to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of small-\nscale fishing operations. \n \n ", "  v\n(iii)  Social  infrastructure.  Establish  facilities  (jetties  and \naccess roads) to enable safe approach and landings at \nmarkets    and  to  provide  safe  shelters  and  sanitation, \nparticularly for women. \n(iv)  Project  management.  Supervise  all  project  activities, \nprovide  monitoring  and  evaluation,  prepare  tender \ndocuments, and undertake accounting and reporting. \nCost Estimates  The total project base cost is estimated at $7.9 million equivalent. \n  The  total  estimated  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies and interest, is $9.5 million equivalent. \n \n \nFinancing Plan    $ million equivalent \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total \n  Exchange  Currency \nAsian Development Bank  5.70  0.00  5.70 \nGovernment  0.93  2.87  3.80 \nTotal  6.6 3  2.87  9.50 \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The loan will be in an amount equivalent to SDR 4.284 million, from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, to finance approximately 60% of \nthe cost of the Project, covering approximately 86% of the foreign \nexchange costs. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nborrower will be the Independent State of Papua New Guinea. \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2008 \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date  31 December 2007 \nExecuting Agency  National Fisheries Authority  \n   \nImplementation  A  project  implementation  unit  will  be  established  within  NFA  to \nArrangements  manage and coordinate the Project. A project steering committee \n(PSC) will be established and meet quarterly to discuss and guide \nproject implementation and review the annual planning process. The \nsteering  committee  will  comprise  members  from  NFA,  the \ncommercial fisheries sector, Department of National Planning and \nMonitoring,  Department  of  Provincial  Affairs,  the  Treasury,  PNG \nHarbours Board, and other fishery stakeholders as appropriate. \nProcurement  All procurement financed by the loan will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts estimated \nat $1 million equivalent or more will be awarded on the basis of \n ", "vi   \ninternational competitive bidding. For civil works contracts below this \namount, local competitive bidding procedures will be applied. \nConsulting Services  The Project will require a total of 224 person-months of consulting \nservices, comprising 115 person-months of international and 109 \nperson-months of domestic services. All consultants will be recruited \nby  NFA,  under  the  quality  and  cost  based  selection  method  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB. ADB approved advance \naction for the selection of consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Direct, quantifiable benefits include (i) increased catch value of fish \nBeneficiaries  and other marine products; (ii) time and cost savings from improved \n  fish-landing access; and (iii) increased marketing opportunities for \n  small boat operators, and fish and marine product vendors using the \n  harbor  facilities.  Fishers  will  benefit  directly  from  the  improved \n  access to the markets, additional fishing time from time savings due \n  to improved jetty and road facilities, and increased sales value from \n  avoidance of contamination of fish. Nonquantifiable benefits include \n  sustaining the productivity of local fisheries, and improved health \n  and personal safety due to the HIV/AIDS prevention measures and \n  provision of toilets and overnight shelters in the harbor areas.   \n \n  The beneficiaries include commercial tuna-fishing vessel owners and \n  workers, small-scale operators, subsistence fishers, and artisanal \n  fishers  engaged  in  production  and  marketing  of  fish  and  marine \n  products. Women who constitute the majority of fish processors, \n  vendors,  and  market  stallholders  will  benefit  directly  from  the \n  Project\u2019s  economic  impact  as  well  as  from  improved  health  and \n  personal safety measures due to the HIV/AIDS prevention measures \n  and  the  improved  sanitation  and  shelters  provided.  The  project \n  beneficiaries will total about 150,000 people (30,000 households) \n  from  the  target  coastal  communities  where  poverty  incidence  is \n  generally equal to, or above, the incidence of poverty in rural areas, \n  41%, which is higher than the national poverty incidence of 37%. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Projects in PNG face many risks, especially poor transparency and \n  accountability in public administration, which is well documented. \nPolitical instability and shifting policies also tend to dampen investor \nconfidence. However, with respect to NFA, its new structure has \nmade  it  much  more  resilient  to  outside  political  pressure  and \ninterference. Another risk is the issue of the marine tenure system, \nwhich is ill defined. Certain Project activities require collaboration by \ncommunities across traditional marine tenure boundaries, and any \nimplementation will need prior consultations and written agreement. \nA  major  assumption  is  that  provincial  authorities  and  staff  are \nprepared and willing to see more influence in decision making being \nvested with communities and other stakeholders.    \n \n ", "   \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a \nproposed loan to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Coastal \nFisheries Management and Development Project. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND \nOPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Commercial fisheries in PNG have performed well in recent years. Exports have \ngrown significantly both in volume and value (from 1,500 metric tons (t) worth K13.1 \nmillion in 1995, to 48,000 t worth K159.7 million in 2000).1 In the past 3 years license \nand access fee revenues have increased by a factor of more than five, from about K5 \nmillion in 1999 to an estimated K28.3 million in 2001.2  \n \n3.  The steadily improving performance of the sector can be attributed to several \nfactors. Fishery management policy changes have removed bureaucratic obstacles that \npreviously  hampered  the  activities  of  domestic  operators  and  discouraged  foreign \ninvestors.  Institutional  and  management  improvements  within  the  National  Fisheries \nAuthority (NFA), which is responsible for management of the nation\u2019s fisheries, have \nmade negotiation and collection of fishery access and license fees more efficient. At the \nsame time the progressive decline of the kina, relative to other currencies, has increased \nthe international competitiveness of PNG\u2019s export fisheries. As a result, the size of the \ndomestic and locally based fishing fleets has grown (the domestic longline fleet has \ngrown from 9 to 47 vessels, and about 14 purse seiners are now locally based), onshore \nprocessing plants have been established (a tuna cannery in Madang and a mackerel \ncannery in Lae, and plans are well-advanced for tuna-loining plants in Lae and Wewak). \nAlso a wider range of seafoods, including value-added products such as canned tuna \nand mackerel, are being exported by domestic operators.  \n \n4.  Supply by local commercial fishing operations to PNG\u2019s domestic markets is also \nincreasing. By-catch from the fresh tuna longline industry is progressively supplanting \nimported canned and frozen fish products, which are becoming increasingly expensive in \nkina terms. Seafood imports were estimated to be 56,000 t in 1990, 35,539 t in 1995, \nand 13,473 t in 1998.3 \n \n5.  Most analysts predict that the kina is unlikely to return to its former high value. \nThe effect of a weak kina increases the relative cost of imported inputs to the fishing \nindustry, especially fuel, but also generates greater revenues from export product sales \ngiven price-elastic export demand, as well as improving product competitiveness on the \ndomestic market. Economic conditions thus appear favorable for the continued growth of \n                                                 \n1  1995 data is from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations PNG Fishery Country \nProfile. 2000 data is from the PNG National Fisheries Authority export database, and is known to be an \nunderestimate because of undeclared exports. \n2  National Fisheries Authority financial data. \n3  1990 data is from NFA (1996), 1995 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s PNG Fishery \nCountry Profile, 1998 data is unpublished information provided by the PNG Customs Department. ", "2   \nPNG\u2019s  commercial  fisheries,  supported  by  an  improved  policy  and  management \nenvironment. \n \n6.  Much of the sector\u2019s growth to date has been assisted or mediated by ADB\u2019s \nFisheries Development Project (FDP).4 The FDP commenced in mid-1999 and has led to \nmany  of  the  policy  changes  referred  to.  The  FDP  has  also  led  to  institutional \nimprovements in NFA, which has become a smaller, more productive, and more focused \nagency with a clear role and mandate, and much better delivery capabilities.5  The \nprivate  fishing  industry,  small-scale  fishers,  resource  owners,  provinces,  and  the \nGovernment now have greater confidence in NFA. The success and positive impacts of \nthe FDP are part of the reason why the present Project, which is a natural follow-on from \nthe FDP, is strongly desired and supported by the Government and by the fishery \nstakeholders. \n \n7.  In mid-2000 the Government of PNG approached ADB for a loan to finance \ninitiatives aimed at enhancing small-scale fisheries development in rural areas of the \ncountry. Loan fact-finding took place during 26 October\u20134 November 2001 and the \nobjectives,  scope,  and  cost  estimates  were  agreed  with  the  Government  in  a \nmemorandum of understanding signed on 1 November 2001.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problems and Opportunities \n8.  Despite the encouraging recent growth of commercial fishing activities, barriers \nto continuing growth remain. One of the most important is the lack of infrastructure to \nenable the efficient transfer of products from areas of resource abundance\u2014which may \nbe remote\u2014to local and overseas market outlets. Infrastructure encompasses a range of \nfacilities:  wharves,  jetties,  roads,  fuel  depots  and  utilities,  ice-making  machinery, \nrefrigeration plants, processing shops and factories, and transportation, especially air \nfreight for highly perishable fresh and chilled seafood products. At present, only Port \nMoresby  and  Lae  have  sufficient  wharf  space,  engineering  services,  and  transport \ninfrastructure to make them attractive as bases for the commercial fishing fleet. Facilities \nat both these locations are now becoming overcrowded and overstretched to the point \nthat future fleet growth is seriously constrained. Expansion of the infrastructure available \nin these locations, and/or development of new facilities in other locations is urgently \nneeded. \n \n9.  Some of the infrastructure needed by the commercial fishing industry can and \nshould be provided by the industry itself, or by other parts of the private sector. This \nincludes  ice  and  refrigeration,  processing  facilities,6  engineering  services,  fuel,  and \ntransportation. In the case of wharves, jetties, roads, and utilities, however, the scale \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan \nto Papua New Guinea for the Fisheries Development Project. Manila. \n5  See Supplementary Appendix A for details on organization, responsibilities, staffing, and mandate of NFA. \n6  In the past, the Government was, mistakenly, involved in the establishment and operation of this kind of \ninfrastructure, with disastrous results. The Government has demonstrated very comprehensively that it is \nnot able to run commercial operations effectively because social objectives get mingled with commercial \nobligations. The result of Government intervention in commercial fishing has been the loss of significant \namounts of public funds through subsidy of unprofitable ventures, stifling of private sector development, \nand now, large numbers of government fisheries centers rusting away in various coastal locations around \nPNG. \n ", "  3\nand scope of the required interventions are beyond the capacity of the private sector. In \nparticular, the issue of obtaining land rights or titles is extremely difficult in PNG, as \nalmost all land is owned by clans or clusters of clans based on user rights; title deeds \noften do not exist. In addition, private sector entities that manage to get a land lease for \na specific purpose run the risk of \u201crenegotiation\u201d if the landowners find the business \nmore  profitable  than  expected  during  the  first  negotiations.  Given  such  constraints, \npublic sector intervention is warranted to correct these nonmarket failures.  Standardized \nharbor  charges  are  already  in  place  throughout  PNG  to  cover  operation  and \nmaintenance costs (O&M). Wharf or jetty infrastructure owned by NFA is being leased to \nprivate sector operators with clear stipulations of obligations, rights, and appropriate \nfees. \n \n10.  Unlike the commercial sector, PNG\u2019s artisanal or small-scale fisheries are not \nflourishing. In fact, many are struggling for economic survival. Most artisanal vessels are \nsmall and not fuel efficient (usually outboard-powered skiffs known as banana boats), \nand the increasing cost of fuel (which in kina terms has tripled in the last 3 years) is a \nmajor burden. In general, small-scale fishers live in poor rural areas where resources are \nrelatively  abundant,  but  where  the  local  market  value  of  seafood,  such  as  fruit, \nvegetables, and other garden produce, has not increased by anything like the price of \nfuel. Rural small-scale producers of these products now find it difficult or impossible to \ncover the cost of transporting their produce to market. The problem is particularly acute \nfor fishing, which requires a much greater input of fuel than does marketing garden \nproduce. However, as most rural dwellers are multioccupational, being involved in both \nfishing and gardening, few are unaffected by the increasing cost of fuel. \n \n11.  Some small-scale fishers catch products such as lobsters and sea cucumbers, \nthe latter being processed to beche-de-mer (dried sea-cucumber), to sell to traders or \nand/or exporters. Because of the declining value of the kina, these products are retaining \nor increasing their value, and are thus increasingly being targeted. This has led to \noverexploitation in some areas, particularly for sea cucumbers, which are valuable, \nrelatively easy to catch, and do not require refrigeration when processed. (The same \nmay apply to trochus and other mother-of-pearl shells, although currently information on \nlandings and exports of these products is insufficient). The net result is that these \nvaluable export commodities are now overfished, while the supply of fresh fish and other \nseafood by artisanal fishers to local markets is in decline. \n \n12.  The  solution  to  this  problem  lies  partly  in  providing  small-scale  fishers  with \nimproved access to more profitable, export-oriented markets for fresh fish and other \nmarine resources. If artisanal fishers could catch high-value products such as sashimi-\ngrade tuna, deep-water snappers, live lobsters, etc., for the export markets, the value of \nsuch products would be many times what it is on local markets, and it would again \nbecome  profitable  for  small-scale  fishers  to  target  such  resources,  which  are  still \nabundant and not overfished. Even urban markets within PNG, such as those in Port \nMoresby and Lae, pay far higher prices for fish and seafood than can be obtained in \nlocal markets in rural areas.  \n \n13.  Today, the Government\u2019s policy is to recognize the private sector as the engine \nof commercial growth and to provide it with basic infrastructure, coupled with a policy \nand regulatory environment in which it can flourish and provide market opportunities to \nrural producers. In line with this approach, NFA has adopted a policy for the fishery \nsector of encouraging commercial seafood exporters to purchase products from artisanal \n ", "4   \nproducers. This approach already works well in the beche-de-mer, shell, barramundi, \nand Torres Strait lobster fisheries, and will be extended to other fishery products. By \npromoting the development of a wharf and social infrastructure for the fishery sector in \nspecific  areas  where  the  conditions  are  most  favorable,  NFA  aims  to  help  the \ncommercial trade grow in those areas, thereby creating new market opportunities for \nartisanal fishers. Lessons learned clearly tell us that the development of small-scale \nfisheries  requires  marketing  links  to  the  growing  commercial  sector,  as  the  highly \nfluctuating artisanal product volumes involved can never justify the cost of building and \noperating infrastructure exclusively for small-scale fishers. This policy is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program update (2002\u20132004) for PNG. \n \n14.  Grant funding from the European Union and Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment is now being channeled to programs for information and training that will \nhelp small-scale fishers understand market and food safety requirements, learn basic \nbusiness skills, and catch/process the type and quality of products that will best satisfy \nmarket demand. As of 2002, aid funds7 will also be used to provide loans or finance hire-\npurchase schemes that will assist artisanal fishers to acquire larger, more fuel-efficient, \nand commercially viable vessels, leading to a progressive improvement of small-scale \nfishing operations. However, the introduction of more appropriate vessels into the small-\nscale  fishing  fleet  will  be  impeded  unless  there  are  parallel  developments  in  rural \ninfrastructure, especially wharves and jetties, which will permit their use. \n \n15.  On the other hand, to prevent overfishing and ensure that all potential target \nspecies can be sustainably harvested, appropriate fisheries management plans need to \nbe developed. These need to be based on an improved understanding of the capacity of \nspecific resources to support new or existing fisheries, and a clearer understanding of \nhow these resources respond to changes in level of exploitation. Better information on \nthe degree to which fishery resources are being exploited is also needed, based on  \nimproved  monitoring  of  fishery  activities  and  harvests.  Resource  management  and \navoidance of overexploitation are clearly areas where public intervention can be made to \nremedy market failure (A review of the sector is in Supplementary Appendix A.). \n \n16.  Management of all PNG\u2019s fisheries is the responsibility of NFA. However, NFA \nrecognizes  that  it  has  neither  the  statutory  role  nor  the  comparative  advantage  to \nundertake extensive provincial and local interventions. Larger-scale commercial fishery \nmanagement is achieved through liaison between NFA and industry, and by monitoring \nand policing a relatively small number of vessels and businesses. However for small-\nscale  fisheries,  involving  thousands  of  participants  dispersed  over  huge  and  often \nremote areas, management is impossible without the active participation of provincial \ngovernments, communities, resource users, resource owners, and a wide range of other \nstakeholders  in  the  sector.  Therefore,  NFA  is  keen  to  promote  partnerships  with \nprovincial and local governments, and/or other service providers that will allow these \nstakeholders to participate more fully in the management process. Recent improvements \nin NFA\u2019s organizational and financial arrangements now allow NFA to mobilize its own \nfinancial and human resources in support of such initiatives. \n \n17.  At  present,  management  capacity  for  fisheries  or  understanding  of  fisheries \nissues  is  extremely  limited  outside  of  NFA  and  the  commercial  industry.  For \nmanagement of small-scale fisheries to be possible, an effective consultative process \n                                                 \n7  Rural Coastal Fisheries Development Project funded by the European Union. \n ", "  5\nbetween NFA and provincial service providers, covering (i) information dissemination, (ii) \nawareness building, and (iii) training and capacity building, is needed. Such a program \nwould need to be run by NFA and anticipates the active participation of all levels of \nprovincial  administration,  nongovernment  organizations,  fisher  associations,  church \ngroups, industry, and other development partners. \n  \n18.  Attempting  to  immediately  implement  such  activities  nationwide  would  be \nunrealistic. A better option would be to gradually begin in a selected number of sites \nwhere management issues are, or are expected to become, a constraint, and at the \nsame time where sufficient will exists in the industry, the provincial governments, and/or \namong  the  fishery  stakeholders.  With  a  small  number  of  successful  site-based \ninterventions  to  serve  as  demonstrations,  a  program  could  then  be  progressively \nextended to other areas depending on the need, interest, and resources available. \n \n19.  Weak  institutions  in  the  fishery  sector  impose  a  disproportionate  burden  on \nwomen. The low social status of women in general, coupled with unsafe conditions in \nmany coastal markets, where law and order are difficult to enforce, make this group \nparticularly  vulnerable.  It  is  generally  the  responsibility  of  women  to  bring  seafood \nproduce to the markets to sell. With profit margins low due to high fuel prices, the added \ntime spent in congested and overcrowded landing places make sale of the produce and \nreturn home within one day very difficult. Whenever overnight stays are necessary, \nlodging expenses cut even further into the already low profit, and many women thus \nchoose to sleep wherever they can. In areas with no facilities like public toilets or \nmeeting places, women face a real risk of being sexually abused when using the beach \nas a toilet after dark, or of being sexually exploited as payment for \u201cprotection\u201d of \nthemselves and their unsold produce while they sleep. Human immunodefficiency virus \n(HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are relatively new  in PNG but \nare spreading with alarming speed. So far nearly 5,000 people in PNG have been \nreported as having HIV/AIDS infection, but the actual number is estimated to be three \ntimes higher. Because of high mobility and frequent overnight stays away from home, \nfisher groups are among those identified as \u201chigh-risk.\u201d  \n \n20.  To assist in mitigating these conditions, this Project will construct necessary \nfacilities:  (i)  small  jetties  for  better  access  and  reduced  turnaround  time,  (ii)  public \nshelters for women traders, (iii) public toilets, and (iv) improved landing areas; and  \nconduct targeted HIV/AIDS campaigns. Through these interventions, society as a whole \nbenefits and the risk of potentially catastrophic social consequences is reduced. \n \n21.  The Project provides an integrated response to these issues. It capitalizes on the \nopportunities and addresses the constraints in a manner that is consistent with the \ndevelopment strategies of the Government, takes full account of the lessons learned in \nprevious fishery sector interventions, and complements the activities and plans of other \ndevelopment partners (especially AusAID and the EU) working in PNG\u2019s fisheries sector. \n \n2.  Lessons Learned \n22.  The  history  of  past  interventions  for  small-scale  fishers  is  not  particularly \nencouraging. The main lessons learned from past projects in PNG can be summarized \nas follows: (i) avoid overestimating implementation capacity, (ii) involve beneficiaries in \nproject design, (iii) be more flexible regarding project scope, (iv) keep project objectives \n ", "6   \nsimple, (v) clearly separate government and private sector responsibilities, and (vi) avoid \nnew or unproven technology.  \n \n23.  All  six  recommendations  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  The \nlimited number of selected provinces and the different development packages offered in \neach  will  enable  NFA  to  gradually  implement  the  Project  with  maximum  efficiency. \nFurthermore, extensive stakeholder consultations were carried out during the project \npreparation phase and the interventions proposed had the broadest consensus. The \nproject  scope  takes  into  consideration  a  range  of  options  to  achieve  sustainable \nmanagement  of  the  marine  resources\u2014there  is  no  \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d  approach.  A \nfundamental principle, when proposing various infrastructure, has been that  the private \nsector, and not NFA, should be responsible for their management. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n24.  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  poverty  in  rural  areas  of  PNG  by \nincreasing, or preventing further declines of, the income of coastal communities. The \nproject objective will be achieved by improving the capacity of fishery stakeholders to \nmanage coastal fisheries in a way that maximizes long-term sustainable benefits, and by \ncreating earning and employment opportunities for coastal fishers through infrastructure \ndevelopment and market access. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n25.  The Project has four main components: \n \n(i)  Fisheries management support. Undertake basic resource surveys and \ninvestigations,  and  enhance  NFA  research  facilities,  to  permit  the \ndevelopment  of  fishery  management  plans;  strengthen  the  fishery \nmanagement  capabilities  of  the  most  efficient  service  providers  in  the \nselected provinces; improve the organization of fishery stakeholders; and \npromote comanagement of resources. \n(ii)  Longline wharf.  Establish the coastal infrastructure needed to promote \ndevelopment  and  investment  by  the  commercial  fishery  sector,  thus \nstrengthening the access to domestic and overseas markets. \n(iii)  Social infrastructure. Establish jetty facilities to provide appropriate and \nimproved access to market outlets; provide safe shelter and sanitation, \nparticularly for women; and improve the business opportunities for small-\nscale fishers. \n(v)  Project  management.  Provide  project  supervision,  accounting  and \nreporting,  preparation  of  tender  documents,  and  general  project \nadministration and backstopping.  \n \n26.  Small-scale  fishery  development  cannot  take  place  in  isolation  from  the \ncommercial  fishing  industry,  which  in  general  has  the  necessary  infrastructure  for \nprocessing and marketing. Thus, during project design, the most appropriate locations \nwere selected based on a range of factors, i.e., availability of supporting infrastructure, \n ", "  7\nrelative abundance of fish resources, potential for increased value from the small-scale \nfishery, and proximity to commercial fishery centers. \n  \n27.  Interventions under the Project therefore focus on four selected provinces that \nsatisfy  the  above  criteria:  Milne  Bay  (fisheries  management  support  and  social \ninfrastructure),  Morobe  (fisheries  management  support,  longline  wharf,  and  social \ninfrastructure),  New  Ireland  (fisheries  management  support),  and  Western  (social \ninfrastructure).  The  selected  provinces  have  different  degrees  of  established \ninfrastructure  and  different  absorptive  development  capacities,  hence  a  different \ndevelopment  package  will  be  provided  to  each.  Broader  benefits  will  result,  both \nnationally  and  to  other  provinces,  particularly  from  activities  under  the  fisheries \nmanagement support component. (A detailed description of the fisheries management \nsupport  component  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  A  detailed  description  of  the \nlongline wharf and the social infrastructure is in Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Fisheries Management Support \n28.  The  Project  has  a  relatively  high  input  of  consulting  services;  many  of  the \nproposed activities are process-oriented, aimed at capacity-building, awareness-raising, \nand consensus-building at provincial and local levels, with the desired outcome being \nthe effective implementation of action plans, rules and management systems in the four \nprovinces. \n   \na.  Institutional Strengthening for Coastal Fisheries Management \n29.  The Project will strengthen and improve fishery management and development \ncapacity  and  procedures  at  provincial  and  local  levels  through  (i)  establishment  of \nconsultative  processes  between  NFA  and  provincial  service  providers  to  plan  and \nimplement business development, identify and address training needs, and establish \nnecessary information flows; (ii) human resource development, mainly through short-\nterm training of fishery stakeholders in biological and economic principles of fishery \nmanagement; (iii) drafting of fisheries legislation to establish the legal basis for working \nand financial relationships between NFA and provincial and local bodies, and to give \neffect to local fisheries management rules; (iv) promotion of the formation of stakeholder \nassociations and other formal groupings to empower stakeholders and enable them to \ndemand  greater  government    accountability;  (v)  establishment  of  provincial  fishery \nadvisory committees to provide a mechanism whereby stakeholders can participate in \nthe fishery management decision-making process; and (vi) establishment of pragmatic \nand  achievable  provincial  fishery  action  plans  based  on  assessments  of  resource \npotential, economic characteristics, and public and private sector capabilities. \n \n30.  The overall output from this subcomponent will thus be a marked improvement in \nthe capacity of provincial service providers to participate effectively in the management \nof fishery and coastal marine resource use. During project implementation, NFA will \nprogressively develop arrangements to ensure that funding of provincial management \narrangements is sustained after project completion. Options will vary from one location \nto another and include funding of management arrangements from license fees collected \nby NFA, development of local licensing systems to be implemented by provinces or \nother  management  partners,  use  of  existing  provincial  or  other  government  budget \n ", "8   \nallocations, industry cost-recovery arrangements, or other methods. The result will be \nthat specific fishery development and management initiatives will be more appropriate, \nbetter targeted, better resourced, and have vastly higher prospects of success. \n \nb.  Coastal Fisheries Assessment and Monitoring \n31.  The Project will improve the assessment of fishery resource potential in PNG \nthrough  (i)  resource  inventories\u2014collating  the  existing  body  of  widely  scattered \ninformation on fishery resources in a form that is usable at the provincial level; (ii) habitat \nmapping  using  remote-sensing  information  and  establishment  of  provincial  marine \nresource geographic information systems; (iii) field surveys of marine resources and \nhabitats to gather fishery-independent information on the extent and condition of key \nresources; (iv) longer-term research projects and studies aimed at elucidating basic \nbiological characteristics and population parameters of key inshore resources, to be \ncarried out mainly from NFA\u2019s Nago Island research station (whose facilities will be \nenhanced for this purpose); and (v) household surveys to obtain information on levels of \nseafood catch and consumption, and on fishing patterns, practices, and knowledge. \n \n32.  These various activities will provide objective information on the resource base in \nthe target provinces that can be used for planning purposes, and will serve as a baseline \nagainst which future surveys can be carried out to measure changes or assess the \nimpact of development and management initiatives. \n \nc.  Strengthening Information Flows  \n33.  Information dissemination will be strengthened by the Project through (i) collation \nof key reports and information on PNG fisheries to be catalogued and converted to \nelectronic format for easy storage and distribution; (ii) production of concise, usable \nfishery  resource  profiles  designed  for  government  decision  makers,  trade  and \ninvestment promotion agencies, entrepreneurs, resource owners, and others who need \nto have a realistic understanding of fishery development opportunities and limitations; \n(iii) production of information and awareness materials needed by fishery stakeholders \nor  that  need  to  be  promulgated  by  agencies  concerned  with  fishery  management \n(including public information and educational products for schools); (iv) establishment of \nprovincial  fishery  statistics  and  data  collection  programs  to  assist  in  fisheries \nmanagement  and  general  development  planning;  and  (v)  establishment  of  a  PNG \nfisheries web site through which documents, statistics, and other information on PNG \nfisheries can be made available to stakeholders. \n \n34.  These activities will complement and enhance those already beginning to be \ncarried  out  by  NFA  nationally,  and  together  will  make  factual  information  on  PNG \nfisheries and marine resources readily available to fishery managers, planners, NGOs, \ndevelopment agencies, and the private sector. \n \nd.  Community-Based Fisheries Development and Management \n35.  The Project will implement effective community-based management of local or \nsmall-scale fisheries at provincial levels through (i) awareness-raising, primarily with \nlocal  NGOs,  among  coastal  communities  on  the  short-term  costs  and  longer-term \nbenefits  of  marine  resource  management;  (ii)  deployment  of  fish-attracting-devices, \nwhich will be used in selected cases as incentives to encourage adoption of community \n ", "  9\nmanagement arrangements or the formation of stakeholder associations; (iii) juvenile \ntrochus-shell  releases  to  improve  awareness  and  secure  participation  in  local \nmanagement initiatives by coastal communities; (iv) small business promotion including \ntraining; (v) women\u2019s skills training on fish quality, marketing, value-added processing, \nand business management; and (vi) development of training and peer-to-peer education \nprograms on HIV/AIDS specifically for the fisheries sector to increase awareness and \nreduce  risk-taking  behavior  in  regard  to  sexual  hygiene  and  sexually  transmitted \ninfections. \n \n36.  The Project will carry out a targeted HIV/AIDS training and awareness campaign, \ndirected at the fishing industry and associated processing industries. The campaign will \nbe conducted through vocational training programs at the National Fisheries College, \nsensitization programs for fishing business managers and the private sector, and peer \neducation programs to be carried out in the workplace and in coastal communities. The \ncampaign will aim to raise understanding and awareness of HIV/AIDS, and minimize \nrisk-taking  behavior  within  the  industry  in  regard  to  sexual  hygiene  and  sexually \ntransmitted  infections.  This  approach  is  in  line  with  national  policies  on  HIV/AIDS \nawareness.8 It is limited in scope because the policy states that national programs \nshould cover general awareness of HIV/AIDS. However, the Government acknowledges \nthat it does not have the resources to initiate widespread workplace programs targeted \nat specific groups. \n \n37.  Once training programs and materials are developed for the National Fisheries \nCollege, their delivery can continue on a routine basis without the need for further inputs \nby the Project. As regards the private sector, long-term implementation of HIV/AIDS \nawareness and behavior change programs in the fishing industry will ultimately need to \nbecome the responsibility of the companies themselves. Fishing businesses will be \nencouraged to integrate the awareness and behavioral change program into their own \ntraining  and  staff  development  programs.  Business  operators  have  indicated  a \nwillingness to cooperate in this regard, as they perceive it as a means of protecting the \ninvestment they have made in their workforce. \n \ne.  Mariculture Development \n38.  The Project will finance improvements to the facilities at NFA\u2019s Nago Island \nresearch  station  to  allow  NFA  to  develop  an  experimental  aquaculture  capability. \nImprovements to be financed under the Project are the conversion of an existing building \nand the provision of equipment necessary to permit aquaculture activities, as well as the \nstrengthening of an existing small jetty to improve boat access. These enhancements \nwill permit the station to produce the trochus shells needed for juvenile release activities \n(para. 35). They will also enable NFA to proceed with a number of other experimental \naquaculture activities (pearl oyster hatchery, experimental capture and ongrowing of \njuvenile ornamental fish, and beche-de-mer culture for restocking experiments), which \nover the longer term are expected to lead to improved marine resource management \nand the creation of small-scale, income-generating opportunities. \n \n39.  Collectively, these activities will create increased income opportunities for small-\nscale fishers and fish processors by promoting sustainable commercial development \nactivities, and by introducing management concepts and arrangements that, over the \n                                                 \n8   PNG National Aids Council. 1998. HIV/AIDS Medium Term Plan. Port Moresby.  \n ", "10   \nlong  term  will  allow  the  maximization  of  sustainable  benefits  from  inshore  marine \nresources. \n \n2.  Longline Wharf \n40.  The proposed intervention, which is described in more detail in Supplementary \nAppendix C, is relatively small in scale and cost, but promises to provide significant \nreturns and benefits for the small-scale fishers in their respective catchment areas as \nwell as for larger commercial operators. NFA has introduced the practice of leasing the \nmanagement  of  the  facilities  it  owns  to  the  private  sector.  Such  lease  agreements \ninclude obligations for public access, collection of  wharfage fees to cover O&M costs, \nand general provision of basic services.  \n \n41.  Inputs required for the capital investment are primarily engineering services and \nmaterials. No special features are included in the proposed wharf component and it will \nbe constructed within an already developed harbor area. The proposed wharf will be \nconstructed on piles to ensure maximum water exchange and in conformity with already \nproven technology in PNG.  \n \n42.  The  new  tuna  longline  wharf  will  remove  a  constraint  that  is  impeding  the \ndevelopment of the commercial tuna longline fleet in Lae. Currently about eight vessels \nare operating from Lae, and lack of facilities is preventing the basing of additional \nvessels. Expansion of Voco Point wharf facilities will allow up to three longliners to tie up \nalongside and unload their catch at any one time, compared with the present situation \nwhen only one vessel can tie up to the fishing wharf. Space requirements for turning \nvessels at the adjacent wharf, which is owned by the Lutheran Shipping Service, will \nnecessitate construction of the new wharf as far to the west as possible. This will mean \nthat only one side of the wharf can be used for longliners, as the water-depth on the \nother  side  is  too  shallow.  The  benefits  of  improved  wharf  facilities  are  decreased \nturnaround times for vessels unloading fish and reprovisioning with fuel, water, and \nstores, resulting in better vessel economy by increasing fishing days. In addition, the \ncurrent practice of rafting vessels together and having to handle cargo and passengers \nover several vessels will be eliminated. Current practices cause disruption to the efficient \nunloading  and  servicing  of  vessels,  pose  security  risks,  have  safety  and  hygiene \nimplications, and compromise the stringent food safety requirements for export-quality \nfish. \n \n43.  Further growth of the tuna longline export industry in Lae is a key requirement for \nthe provision of commercial market opportunities for small-scale fishers. The growth to \npresent levels of fishing activity has permitted the establishment of weekly air-freight \nservices from Lae to Port Moresby by PNG\u2019s domestic carrier, Air Niugini. Further \ngrowth in the fleet will allow the development of additional air-freight capacity, which in \nturn  will  allow  small-scale  fishers  to  access  markets  in  Port  Moresby  or  overseas. \nSeveral of the existing tuna longline operators in Lae have already expressed interest in \npurchasing  high-value  seafood  products  from  small-scale  fishers  for  resale  in  Port \nMoresby or overseas. \n \n3.  Social Infrastructure  \n44.  Small-scale fishers in PNG generally only catch fish for commercial sale when \ncash is needed for school fees, building materials, and general basic needs. The high \n ", "  11\nfuel  prices  today  have  caused  most  small-scale  fishery  operations  to  be  only \nmarginally\u2014if  at  all\u2014profitable.  The  opportunistic  nature,  and  subsequent  erratic \ncatches, of the fishery has little attraction for export traders, who rely on predictable \nregularity, volumes, and quality. The proposed jetties and adjacent facilities will, for the \nfirst time, provide an opportunity for small-scale fishers to collectively comply with such \nrequirements. Experiences from other small-scale fisheries projects point to a long time \nframe before consistent fish quality and regularity are reached. Within such settings, \nquantifiable  benefits  cannot  be  applied  with  any  degree  of  certainty.  However,  the \ncombination of a growing private fishery sector and the increasing cash needs to pay for \nbasic necessities are likely to assure successful development. The proposed structures \nwill (i) improve the market opportunities for small-scale fishers; (ii) enable fish products \nto be landed in good quality; (iii) provide the critical mass of marine products through \ngrowth in the total number of fishers, thus making it worthwhile for traders to export; and \n(iii) greatly reduce damage to boats and the risk of personal injury. \n \n45.  In Daru, the jetty will eliminate the need to walk across the mud flats at low tide \ncarrying goods and fish, and will create access to moored boats. This will significantly \nreduce the effort in carrying goods and fish to the shore, reduce the health risk of \nexposure to the polluted mud, and reduce the contamination of fish and other products. \nThe present situation, where fish have to be carried across the mud, is inconsistent with \nNFA\u2019s efforts to upgrade hygiene and food safety standards for fish export. The new \nfacilities  would  eliminate  this  problem  and  result  in  significant  time-savings  and \nincreased convenience, in that boats tied to the jetty will be accessible rather than \nstranded on the mudflats or moored far offshore depending on the state of the tide. \nOther advantages include better security for boats and belongings compared with the \npresent situation. \n \n46.  Sanderson Bay is the main harbor in Alotau, the provincial capital of Milne Bay. \nBecause of the large number of small vessels in the province, the harbor is congested \nand overcrowded. Fishing vessels tend to receive lower priority than coastal trading or \npassenger vessels and are often forced to moor in the middle of the bay and to load and \nunload in the muddy shore areas at the base of the bay, or to transfer products across \nother vessels. The main town market is about 1.5 kilometer from the wharf and no \nconsistent  means  of  transport  exists  between  the  two,  thus  fishers  have  difficulty \ntransporting their catch for sale. The suggested structures at Sanderson Bay will provide \ndirect jetty access for the fishers, and the improved road access will facilitate better \ntransport to main markets.  \n \n47.  At Voco Point, more than 50 small boats at any time are moored directly onto the \npebble  beach.  Wave  action  often  damages  hull  and  outboard  engines,  and  makes \nmoving produce from the boat to the shore very difficult. The whole area is littered with \ngarbage,  and  the  hygienic  situation  in  general  does  not  allow  any  seafood  to  be \nmarketed for export. This situation will be alleviated with the construction of a jetty and \nsupplementary facilities. \n \n48.  In Sanderson Bay and at Voco Point, the safety and sanitation situation must \nalso be addressed. Very often women traders cannot sell all their produce the same day \nand, therefore, have to stay overnight. No shelters are available for rest areas or to \nprotect the products for sale. The beach is the only area available for use as a public \ntoilet. For many women traders, this poses a real risk of being accosted at the beach at \nnight or of being forced to provide sex for \u201cprotection\u201d of their belongings during the \n ", "12   \nnight. Thus, the Project will also construct sanitation facilities and traditional transit \nhouses or shelters to improve the safety situation during the night, especially for women. \nGiven the particular circumstances faced by the small-scale fishers, their income level, \nand the appalling safety and security conditions in general, provision of these facilities is \nmerited. \n \n49.  Other benefits will also arise from these interventions. These include savings in \ntime and convenience gained by direct access from the jetty, reduced risk of personal \ninjury in getting on and off vessels, and decreased damage or loss of goods being \ntransferred. The removal of the need for banana boats to pull up on the beach will also \nresult in reduced damage and repair costs from grounding on rocks, etc.  \n \n4.  Project Management \n50.  A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established and headed by the NFA \nprojects manager. It will have members from NFA\u2019s accounts division and the provincial \nand industrial liaison office, and include the project coordinator. The PIU will be assisted \nby the team leader of the international consultants and by the consultants who will be \ntasked  with  the  tendering  procedures  and  with  supervising  civil  works.  Specific \nresponsibilities include (i) arranging regular steering committee meetings; (ii) providing \nbudgeting  and  accounting,  including  regular  accounts  auditing;  (iii)  preparing  loan \nwithdrawal  applications;  (iv)  arranging  for  the  tendering  and  contracting  of  the \ninfrastructure components; (v) handling procurement of equipment and materials where \nnecessary; and (vi) reporting. \n  \nC.  Special Features \n51.  The project design takes into account ADB\u2019s commitment to poverty reduction in \nits member countries. While the longline wharf is justified on quantified benefits (para. \n70), the other infrastructure components of the Project are justified on the basis of their \nlarger societal impacts (such as the reduced incidence of rape and HIV/AIDS) for which \nbenefit valuation is not readily possible. During the design phase of the Project, all of the \nwomen interviewed identified sexual abuse as the highest risk. As social infrastructure \nonly constitutes 12% of the total project costs, the overall economic viability of the \nProject is not threatened. Surveys carried out during the project design phase indicated \nthat the potential users have a strong willingness to pay for improvements in these \nfacilities.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n52.  The total project base cost is estimated at about $7.9 million equivalent. The total \nestimated project cost, including physical and price contingencies and interest, is about \n$9.5 million equivalent. The allowance for price contingencies over the implementation \nperiod is 5% for the first year and 7% per year thereafter for local costs, and 2.4% per \nyear for foreign costs. A physical contingency of 10% is applied to the base cost. A \nsummary is shown in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  13\nTable 1.

Financing Plan \n53.  ADB will fund 60% of the total project costs and the Government will finance the \nremaining 40%. The Government has requested that the foreign exchange and local \ncurrency components of the Project be financed as shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange   Currency  Cost  Percent \n         \nAsian Development Bank  5.70  0.00  5.70  60 \nGovernment  0.93  2.87  3.80  40 \n     Total  6.63  2.87  9.50       100 \n     Percent   70    30    100   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n54.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan in an amount equivalent to SDR 4.284 \nmillion from its Special Funds resources to finance 60% of the project cost, covering \napproximately 86% of the foreign exchange costs. The loan will have a maturity of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Borrower will be the \nIndependent State of Papua New Guinea. The proceeds of the loan will be relent to NFA \n ", "14   \non the same terms and conditions through a subsidiary loan agreement in form and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n55.  The Executing Agency will be NFA, the Government\u2019s noncommercial statutory \nauthority  legally  mandated  with  responsibility  for  managing  the  nation\u2019s  fishery \nresources. NFA has demonstrated its capability as Executing Agency in the ongoing \nFisheries  Development  Project  and  is,  after  its  recent  restructuring,  well  suited  to \nundertake this function. NFA receives all the monies from access and license fees from \nthe distant-water-fishing fleet and the domestic commercial fleet, and therefore has the \nmeans to not only pay for its own operational costs but also to pay for various fisheries \nmanagement developments at the provincial level. \n \n56.  NFA will have overall responsibility for implementing the Project, and has set up \na PIU within NFA. The PIU will be assisted by the consultants provided under the \nProject.  In  addition,  each  civil  works  component  includes  provisions  for  tender \npreparation and supervision, and the persons selected for these will also assist the PIU.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n57.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years. Most activities will be carried out \nduring the first 4 years. Experience shows that procedural delays almost always occur \nwithin PNG, resulting in slippage of both inputs and outputs. The additional year is \nprovided to absorb this slippage. The Project is expected to commence in December \n2002 and be completed by December 2007. The implementation schedule is shown in \nAppendix 4. \n \n3.  Procurement \n58.  All procurement financed by the loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. International competitive bidding will be applied for civil works valued at \n$1 million or more; local competitive bidding will be applied for civil works below this \namount, where it is not expected to attract foreign contractors, and where capable local \ncontractors  are  in  country.  International  shopping  procedures  will  be  applied  for \nprocurement of goods with contract values estimated at less than $500,000 equivalent, \nand direct purchase for equipment valued at below $100,000 equivalent. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n59.  The Project will require a total of 224 person-months of consulting services, \nincluding 115 person-months of international consulting: resource management advisor \nand team leader (35), environmental monitoring adviser (5), data management adviser \n(11), fisheries information adviser (12), legal adviser (6), community fisheries adviser \n(18), fisheries development adviser (18), and unallocated (10); and 109 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services:  engineering  specialist  (4),  resource  management \nspecialist (30), fisheries data specialist (21), documentation and information specialist \n(30), HIV/AIDS training specialist (3), social assessment specialist (7), and unallocated \n(14). All consultants will be recruited by NFA under the quality and cost based selection \n ", "  15\n(QCBS) method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The shortlisted firms will be required to submit a \nfull technical proposal. NFA requested, and ADB approved, advance action for the \nselection of consultants. Detailed terms of reference for consulting services are shown in \nAppendix 5. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n60.  NFA will establish an imprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB.9 \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest \naccount will not exceed the equivalent of $250,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures \nprocedures may be used for reimbursement of expenditures costing less than $50,000 \nequivalent and for liquidation of advances made from the imprest account. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n61.  NFA will maintain consistent records and accounts adequate to identify goods \nand services financed from the proceeds of the loan. NFA will (i) maintain separate \naccounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and related financial statements are \naudited annually in accordance with sound auditing principles by independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of \neach fiscal year, certified copies of the audited accounts and the report of the auditor. \nProvisions have been made for engaging external auditing through the Auditor General's \nOffice, with costs financed under the loan. A project completion report will be submitted \nto ADB within 3 months after physical completion of the Project. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n62.  A project steering committee, headed by the Managing Director of NFA, will be \nestablished and meet quarterly to discuss and guide project implementation and review \nthe annual planning process. The committee will comprise members from NFA, the \ncommercial fishery sector, Department of National Planning and Monitoring, Department \nof Provincial Affairs, the Treasury, PNG Harbours Board, and other fishery stakeholders \nas appropriate. \n \n63.  Quarterly reports detailing implementation progress, achievements in accordance \nwith the indicators in the project framework, disbursement, consulting inputs, as well as \nissues pertaining to disbursement projections for the following quarter and any delay in \nimplementation schedule, will be prepared by the PIU and submitted to NFA with copies \nmade available to ADB. \n \n8.  Project Review \n64.  An inception mission will be fielded one month after the consultants are fielded \nand an initial review of the Project will be undertaken at the end of the first year of \nimplementation. A midterm review will be undertaken approximately 30 months after the \n                                                 \n9  NFA is currently the executing agency for Loan 1656-PNG, which maintains an imprest account. NFA is \ntherefore familiar with the procedures for establishing and operating  an imprest account and  would be \nable to manage the new imprest account efficiently. \n ", "16   \nstart  of  implementation  and  focus,  in  particular,  on  the  impact  and  results  of  the \ncommunity-based  activities.  On  completion  of  the  Project,  a  final  review  will  be \nundertaken. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n1.  General  \n65.  The benefits from the proposed Project are wide ranging, but primarily aimed at \npoorer coastal communities. They include specific benefits that can be directly attributed \nto narrowly defined interventions that can be quantified accurately, such as the improved \nwharf facility for tuna longliners. Benefits associated with the fisheries management \nsupport can be roughly quantified in terms of saved present value of the otherwise \noverexploited fish stock, and the diversion of effort into underutilized fish stock. Other \nhard-to-quantify  benefits  associated  with  the  basic  social  structures  can  only  be \ndescribed in more general and qualitative ways. \n \n66.  The  Project  will  benefit  rural  coastal  communities.  Approximately  131,000 \nhouseholds, which comprise 23% of all rural households, are engaged in fishing on a \nregular basis, with about 60% fishing for purely subsistence consumption and 40% for \nconsumption as well as sale. This group will be the primary beneficiaries of the fisheries \nmanagement  support  component.  Beneficiaries  of  the  infrastructure  development \ncomponents  will  be  existing  and  new  small-scale  commercial  and  semicommercial \nfishers, boat passengers, women fish traders, and commercial longliners within the \nvicinity of Daru, Sanderson Bay, and Voco Point. Appendix 6 provides an assessment of \nthe poverty impact. \n \n2.  Fisheries Management Support \n67.  The proposed assistance for fisheries management support will ultimately result \nin a more productive and sustainable use of coastal fishery resources. Large benefits \nresults from investment in the sustainable use of a renewable resource like fisheries, \ncompared  with  the  alternative  of  overexploitation  and  eventual  exhaustion  of  the \nresource. These benefits include the attainment of a sustainable level of exploitation, \nand the creation of a more certain and favorable environment for the private sector to \ninvest in fishing and value-adding enterprises. More certainty about the size of resources \nand the level of sustainable catch for specific fisheries reduces the level of risk for \ncommercial activities, which otherwise has to be factored into profit expectations.  \n \n68.  The impact of this component can be best assessed by roughly estimating the \nlikely effects on the total value of the coastal fishery. In 2000, the total value of the \noutputs of coastal fisheries was calculated to be around K120 million per year ($36 \nmillion) (Supplementary Appendix A). With the effort to halt the overfishing of the stocks \nof beche-de-mer and trochus, which combined account for K20 million, coupled with \nassistance to direct the coastal fisheries toward underutilized fish stocks, a conservative \nincrease in the value of production of 5%, equivalent to an increase of K6 million per \nyear ($1.8 million), can be assumed. This will equate to an incremental economic output \nper family of K46 per year (130,000 families live in the coastal communities). The \nimproved management practices resulting from the Project are expected to encourage \n ", "  17\nsustainable exploitation and so prevent (or in some cases reverse) the decline of these \nresources.  \n \n69.  Approximately K1.7 million will be required to maintain the momentum of the \nfisheries management support program after the conclusion of the 5\u2013year development \nperiod.  With  an  assumed  economic  impact  of  K6  million  per  year,  this  is  a  good \ninvestment for NFA to fund through its recurrent revenues. \n \n3.  Longline Wharf \n70.  Specific benefits arising from the capital investment include (i) incremental net \ncatch  value  from  commercial  and  artisanal  fisheries  sold  for  export  and/or  in  local \nmarkets; (ii) increased savings in O&M costs and time savings for fisheries and transport \nboat operators from improved mooring facilities and lower turnaround times. Only the \nVoco Point longline wharf component was subjected to an economic analysis. Based on \nthe benefits noted, the longline wharf has an economic internal rate of return of 24% and \nan economic net present value of K3.192 million at 12% economic opportunity cost of \ncapital.  The  economic  return  was  tested  for  sensitivity  to  changes  in  the  main \nparameters of costs and benefits, and indicates that the longline wharf is relatively \ninsensitive to changes in these factors (Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n4.  Social Infrastructure \n71.  The  benefits  derived  from  the  development  of  social  infrastructure  at  Daru, \nSanderson Bay, and Voco Point will be improved safety and security for the many \nwomen traders, better movement of fish from sea to shore, better quality produce, and \nmore efficient transfer of goods to the marketing chains. In Sanderson Bay, local public \nservice vehicles will be able to park in a dedicated area to load fish for transport to the \nmarket and to consumers on the oil palm plantations nearby, thereby improving the \ntransportation link and increasing market opportunities for fishers and fish traders. As a \nresult of this development, coastal fish production marketed through Sanderson Bay \nharbor could increase significantly, perhaps doubling the present low production levels of \naround 500 kilograms per week. \n \n72.  Additional benefits relate to improving the efficiency of the harbor by reducing \nvessel turnaround time. Greater numbers of small boats will be accommodated in a \nmore  compact  area,  reducing  the  general  congestion  and    obstruction  caused  by \nanchored vessels and their mooring lines. Time spent waiting for a mooring and having \nto move off moorings to make way for bigger vessels when the harbor is congested will \nalso be saved. Dredging of the harbor and removal of the dead coral head in the middle \nwill increase the capacity of the harbor and improve traffic flow. \n \n73.  These benefits can be quantified, though not valued due to data constraints, in \nterms of the opportunity cost of the time saved for the passengers going about their \nbusiness bringing their fish and goods to market. Around 170 boats with a total of almost \n2,500  passengers  are  currently  using  the  three  harbors  on  an  average  day.  This \ncorresponds to a total time saved of 1,445 hours per day (based on each person saving \nhalf an hour of his or her daily time in Sanderson Bay and Voco Pint, and 1 hour per day \nin Daru where the wider mudflats pose a greater inconvenience). On an annual basis, \nthe total time saved is estimated at 527,425 hours per year, which on the basis of a 10- \nhour working day is equivalent to 52,743 person-days of time saved per year. \n ", "18   \n \nB.  Nonquantifiable Benefits \n74.  The Project is expected to give rise to a range of widespread, indirect, and \nnonquantifiable  benefits  that  cannot  be  captured  in  the  economic  analysis  of  the \ninvestment  component.  These  include,  initially,  prevention  of  further  decline  and, \nsubsequently,  sustained  or  even  improved  fishery  catch  for  food  and  commercial \npurposes  through  the  introduction  of  appropriate  management  regimes  for  inshore \nfishery resources. This will be achieved by building the capacity of provincial and local \ngovernments  and  coastal  communities  for  planning,  improving  management  of  the \ninshore  fishery,  and  developing  of  information  services  and  flows  related  to  stock \nmanagement and marketing. This benefit will be enhanced through the promotion of \ncommunity-based management arrangements for coastal fishery resources, including \nempowerment of coastal communities by reinforcing custodial and traditional rights to \nresources  and  institutionalizing  greater  responsibility  for  their  management  and \nconservation.  \n \n75.  The net outcome of the Project as a whole is expected to be a more productive \nand sustainable coastal fishery, and increased income and employment creation leading \nto  improved  livelihoods  and  reduced  poverty  in  coastal  communities.  In  addition, \nnonquantifiable  benefits  are  expected  from  improved  stock  and  market  information, \nimproved  shore  facilities  and  public  amenities  for  passengers  and  marketers, \ntransshipment  to  market,  reduction  in  commercial  losses  due  to  delays  and  poor \nfacilities, and related lowered commercial risks. \n \n76.  The  Project  will  contribute  directly  to  poverty  reduction,  and  the  livelihood \nimprovements it generates will be pro-poor, having a proportionally greater impact on the \nquality of life of the rural poor in coastal areas than on other segments of the population. \nThe Project is targeted to coastal communities and districts that have a high portion of \ntheir members living below the poverty line. Consequently, the distribution of benefits \nand social impact will be skewed to poorer communities (Appendix 6).  \n \nC.  Financial Sustainability  \n77.  The Voco Point wharf capital investment component and the social infrastructure \ncomponents  were  subjected  to  financial  sustainability  analysis  as  these  have \nimplications for recurrent O&M. In principle, the users should be required to contribute \nthrough user fees at a sufficient level to cover at least the O&M expenses, and ideally \nmake a contribution to debt servicing and a reasonable return to equity. NFA already \nholds several land titles or leases for fisheries infrastructure around the country and, in \nthe past, NFA or the provincial fisheries authorities managed these facilities. Since its \nrestructuring, NFA is now tendering management contracts for all its wharf facilities to \nthe private sector, which include O&M that will be covered through standard harbor fees \nand other applicable charges. This arrangement will also be implemented for the longline \nwharf at Voco Point. For the small boat jetties and related infrastructures at Daru, \nSanderson Bay, and Voco Point, an annual registration fee is envisaged. It will be based \non size and capacity, and charged to cover the O&M expenses. An annual fee is easier \nto administer than other methods, because of the large number of boats (Supplementary \nAppendix F). \n \n ", "  19\nD.  Social and Environmental Impacts \n1.  Poverty Impact \n78.  Poverty in PNG is concentrated in the remote rural areas in the interior highland \nprovinces  and  in  coastal  communities  of  the  14  maritime  provinces.  The  coastal \ncommunities are typical of poor rural communities where poverty incidence is about \n41%, which is above the national poverty incidence of 37%. Whether their economic \nstatus puts them above or below the poverty line, most households rely on subsistence-\nbased livelihoods\u2014each is dependent on farming and/or fishing for sustenance and \ncash income. The typical household is an extended family comprising on average 5\u20137 \nmembers. Those that sell fish or marine products have a division of labor generally along \ngender lines: male members do the fishing, and female members sell what they do not \nconsume to traders or in the local market. The cash income thus derived is spent on \nfood staples and other basic necessities.  \n \n79.  In each target area, the harbor serves as the hub of the local fishing industry so \nthat  fishing  and  fish  trading  by  the  local  population  are  linked  to  the  facilities  and \nmarketing opportunities emanating from the services provided to fishing vessels that \ndock for fish and supplies. The Project\u2019s investments to improve the harbor facilities in \neach target area will therefore generate a range of direct and spin-off effects related to \nthe increased value and volume of fish and marine products handled at each harbor. \nThese are quantified in the economic analyses based on expected income earnings and \nemployment benefits for the many poor and vulnerable groups whose livelihoods are \npartially or wholly linked to the fishing industry.  \n \n2.   Gender and Social Issues \n80.  Women are expected to benefit most from improved facilities for retail fish trading \nand processing as they dominate this aspect of the fishing industry. Specifically, the \nsmall boat jetties and the improved access to the commercial fish centers will open a \nmarket for the fish and other commercially valuable marine products generally caught or \nsold by women traders and vendors. \n \n81.  Apart from the economic benefits, other nonmonetary benefits will accrue to \nwomen through the activities supported under the community fisheries management \nprogram.  Women  will  be  targeted  for  the  small  business  training  and  technical \nassistance activities, encouraged to form stakeholder associations, and motivated to \nparticipate in  other community-level activities to be sponsored by the Project. \n \n82.  An important issue is the growing HIV/AIDS infection rate in PNG, especially \namong women. The fishing industry is suspected to be one of the main sectors where \nHIV/AIDS is transmitted. The Project\u2019s support for a training and public awareness \nprogram on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases will be targeted at women and \ncommercial sex workers in the harbor areas.  \n \n83.  A second issue concerns the vulnerability of women fish vendors to rape and \ncrime common in the harbor and beach areas. The improved jetties, and construction of \ntoilets and overnight shelters will greatly increase the personal safety of women who \notherwise would have to use unsecured public areas. \n \n ", "20   \n3.  Environment \n84.  The Project as designed will have significant positive environmental impacts. The \nfisheries  management  support  component  will  result  in  improved  coastal  marine \nresources, and will lead to increased awareness and positive attitudes regarding marine \nresource  conservation  and  management.  The  project  management  component  is \nenvironmentally neutral.  \n \n85.  The  environmental  implications  of  the  proposed  coastal  infrastructure \nsubcomponents were considered as part of the site selection and design process. The \nfacilities  in  each  location  were  examined  thoroughly  in  an  environmental  screening \nprocess, which involved site visits, stakeholder consultations, and review of available \ndocumentation. The initial environmental examination (Supplementary Appendix D) and \nits summary (Appendix 8) conclude that the proposed infrastructure activities will have \nno significant residual environmental impacts. \n \n4.  Impact Management Measures \n86.  Proposed  impact  management  measures  were  identified  in  the  initial \nenvironmental examination and include specific design features, recommendations for \nbest  practices  for  construction,  and  development  of  operational  procedures  and \ncontingency plans to reduce the risk of accidental events (such as fuel spills). All these \nenvironmental management measures are conditions in the tenders, and the selected \ncontractor will be responsible for their implementation. \n \n87.  Environmental and social benefits monitoring was included in the costing of each \ninfrastructure component to ensure that the environmental management measures are \ncomplied  with  and  to  confirm  the  predictions  of  environmental  effects  that  may  be \nassociated  with  the  subprojects.  Monitoring  is  also  to  be  supported  by  technical \nassistance, to ensure suitable design of monitoring activities and the quality of results \nand interpretations. \n \nE.  Risks \n1.  Country Risk \n88.  Projects in PNG face many risks. The poor transparency and accountability in \npublic  administration  are  well  documented  by  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  in  various \nreports10  and  present  a  number  of  problems  and  risks  to  project  design  and \nimplementation. Political instability and shifting policies also tend to dampen investor \nconfidence. \n \n89.  The PNG economy has had shocks outside of the control of the Government. \nThe  El  Ni\u00f1o  drought  of  1997;  the  Asian  financial  crisis;  the  continuing  decline  in \ncommodity prices for copra, coffee, and cocoa; and the increases in world oil prices in \n2000 and 2001 have resulted in considerable macroeconomic volatility.  \n \n90.  In community development, determining the appropriate implementation period is \ndifficult. Most people living in coastal communities in PNG have short-term needs and \n                                                 \n10 For example ADB. 1999. Country Operational Strategy Study: Papua New Guinea. Manila. \n ", "  21\nobligations, that are in direct contrast to the long-term objectives of the Project. To \nsuccessfully organize communities under such circumstances may turn out to be more \ntime consuming than envisaged. \n \n91.  The country also has a serious law and order problem, more apparent in the \ncities than in the provinces, which discourages investment and reduces the profitability \nof business. This is exacerbated by extreme poverty in many areas, particularly in some \ninland areas, such as the highlands and Morobe Province, and in settlements around the \nlarger towns. The looming HIV/AIDS epidemic is also a threat, and promises to hit the \neducated, productive, and economically active age groups hardest.  \n \n2.  Land and Marine Tenure \n92.  Land disputes continue to bedevil many investment projects in PNG. Traditional \nlandowners  continually  interfere  with,  or  sabotage,  the  operations  of  commercial \nenterprises, public utilities, and even hospitals and schools in their attempts to forcibly \nincrease royalties, obtain compensation, or otherwise enhance the benefits they receive \nfrom leases or agreements relating to their land. In some cases, especially in regard to \nmineral exploitation or large-scale industrial projects, provincial or national governments \nmay try to accelerate projects by unilaterally speaking on behalf of landowners, which \ninvariably leads to disputes later on. In some cases, agreed projects have been blocked \nfor months or years because landowning groups cannot agree among themselves about \nhow benefits should be distributed. \n \n93.  The Government is trying to introduce land registration to identify who or which \ngroups lay claim to land in different parts of the country. This reform has met with strong \nopposition, and is seen by many as an attempt to alienate traditional owners from their \nland. While this is not the objective of the reforms, the issue has recently been used to \nstir up public opinion against the government of the day. \n \n94.  For the infrastructure parts of the Project, ensuring the absence of land tenure \nproblems as a prerequisite to site selection has minimized the problems relating to land \ntenure.  All  the  infrastructure  interventions  will  take  place  on  land  to  which  the \nGovernment holds title. While this approach does not entirely guarantee the absence of \nproblems, it minimizes their likelihood. \n \n95.  Marine tenure presents its own somewhat different set of problems, but these \ncan be transformed into opportunities by proper handling. The tenure systems in place \nare not defined adequately in the law of the country, although they are acknowledged. \nThe prerequisites for community-based management include the definition of boundaries \nand the acknowledgement of rights. While the latter is, in theory at least, acknowledged, \nboundaries have not been formally established in the marine zone and are subject to \ndispute. The issue of deploying fish attracting devices, straddling different community \nmarine tenure claims, will necessitate written agreements from all involved communities \nbefore deployment. \n \n3.  Financial Risks \n96.  The PNG Government, as borrower, will onlend the funds to NFA. Under this \narrangement, NFA will be responsible for the provision of counterpart funds and for \nfinancing the debt service on the loan. At the present time, NFA is generating more than \n ", "22   \nsufficient revenue in access fees, license fees, and fines to meet such an obligation, and \ncurrent projections indicate that this situation will continue. However, several factors may \nact to reduce NFA\u2019s income. These include (i) relocation of foreign fishing efforts further \neast away from the PNG zone; this is expected over the next 1\u20132 years as a result of the \nstrong El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon currently developing; (ii) increasing domestication of PNG\u2019s \nfisheries, which will tend to displace foreign vessels paying access fees; (iii) changes in \nGovernment policy on fishery access (for instance, granting of access as an adjunct to \npolitical  or  economic  agreements);  and  (iv)  changes  in  Government  policy  towards \nNFA\u2019s financial autonomy. \n \n97.  The  major  generalized  financial  risk  is  the  continued  instability  of  the  PNG \neconomy, against a background of lowering export revenues, a declining currency, and \npolitical uncertainty. The continued fall in the value of the kina is of major concern, and is \nhaving negative effects on the buying power of the bulk of the population. It does, \nhowever, contribute to the continuing profitability of PNG\u2019s export-oriented domestic \nfisheries,  whose  operation  is  central  to  the  Project.  In  addition,  the  declining  kina \nencourages the purchase of domestic fish products and a corresponding decline in \nimports. \n \n4.  Technical Risks  \n98.  PNG sits on the edge of the \u201cring of fire\u201d around the Pacific and is subject to \nseismic and volcanic activity. The main technical risks to the Project are geological and \nmarine processes, including tsunamis (tidal waves), earthquakes, surges and seiches, \nland slips caused by seismic activity, volcanic eruptions, and sedimentation from river \ndeposition. The southeast of the country is also subject to cyclones. Designing a project \nfor all these possible natural disasters is impossible. While the infrastructure plans are \ncompliant with design and construction guidelines and local rules currently in force for \nthe Project, a serious natural disaster will present a risk to the Project. \n \n99.  The project design takes into account the existence of these risks to the greatest \ndegree possible. Given the likelihood of the risks occurring, the benefits and positive \nimpacts of the Project are expected to outweigh the costs and will bring significant \nimprovement to the quality of life of the rural poor at a time when other options may be \nlimited or unavailable. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n100.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  HIV/AIDS. The Government will carry out an HIV/AIDS training and awareness \ncampaign  through  vocational  training  programs  at  the  National  Fisheries \nCollege,  sensitization  programs  for  fishing  business  managers,  and  peer \neducation  programs  to  be  carried  out  in  the  workplace  and  coastal \ncommunities. \n \n ", "  23\n(ii)  Gender development. The Government will ensure that gender awareness \ntraining  for  government  officials,  private  sector  managers,  and  other \nparticipants in the community-based fisheries development and management \ncomponent of the Project is carried out. \n \n(iii)  Marine tenure. The Government will ensure that prior to deployment of any \nfish attracting devices, all concerned communities will have agreed in writing to \nshared use of these devices.     \n \n(iv)  Counterpart funds. The Government will ensure that the Project is accorded \nhigh priority and that adequate funds are allocated for disbursement for project \nactivities beginning in 2002 and for subsequent years, and that procedures are \nin place for timely release of funds for project activities throughout project \nimplementation. \n \n(v)  Benefit monitoring and evaluation. The Government will ensure that  project \nimplementation, and the overall benefits derived therefrom, are monitored and \nevaluated on an annual basis in accordance with a program satisfactory to \nADB. \n \n(vi)  Environment. With respect to the infrastructure components of the Project, the \nGovernment  will  comply  with  all  applicable  national,  provincial,  and  local \nenvironmental laws; comply with all applicable ADB environmental guidelines; \nand ensure that any adverse environmental impacts related to the construction \nand  operation  of  the  facilities  under  the  Project  are  minimized  through \nimplementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  programs \nrecommended in the initial environmental examination report concerned and \nagreed upon with ADB. \n \n(vii)  User  fees.  The  Government  will  ensure,  or  cause  to  ensure,  that  fees \napplicable for use of the project wharves and jetties will be set at levels that \nallow for cost recovery of at least the ongoing O&M costs of each such facility. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n101.  The Government has agreed that prior to loan effectiveness, the PSC will be set \nup and a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and NFA for relending the \nloan proceeds to NFA, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, will be executed and \neffective. \n \nC.

Introduction \n \n1.  Detailed cost estimates for each subcomponent are included in this appendix. Costs for \nthe 5-year project were prepared using COSTAB and are based on prices prevailing in Papua \nNew Guinea in the third quarter of 2001 expressed on a calendar year basis. The costs include \nan allowance for taxes and duties that currently prevail (mostly 10% value added tax). No \nallowance has been made for exemptions from taxes and duties that may apply to the Project. \nCosts are expressed in kina and dollars using an exchange rate of K3.846 = $1.0 that prevailed \nin March 2002. \n \nB.  Physical and Price Contingencies \n \n2.  An allowance of 10% of base costs is allowed for the physical contingency for civil \nworks, while for most other items (training, materials, etc) a rate of 5% is used, except for \nspecialist services where the rate is set at zero. The price escalation factor for the local cost \ncomponent is 5% for the first year (remainder of 2001), then 7% per year thereafter, while for \nforeign costs a rate of 2.4% is used for each year. These rates are based on recent Asian \nDevelopment Bank projections for PNG. \n \nC.  Total Project Costs and Financing \n \n3.  Total project costs amount to $9.5 million (K36.500 million equivalent) including physical \ncontingencies of $0.78 million and price contingencies of $0.56 million. Taxes and duties are \nestimated at $0.667 million. Foreign exchange costs amount to $6.6 million or 65% of total \ncosts. It is assumed that ADB will provide loan financing of $5.7 million equivalent, or up to 60% \nof total project costs, covering approximately 86% of the foreign exchange requirements. The \nPNG Government will fund the balance of $3.8 million equivalent, or 40% of the total, including \nall recurrent operational costs.  \n4.  The Project is composed of three components: \n(i)  Capital Investment: $2.230 million (28% of base costs); \n(ii)  Fisheries Management Support: $4.179 million (51%); \n(iii)  Project Management: $1.745 million (21%). \n \nD.

", "Appendix 6  41\n SUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT \n \n \n1.  The objective of the proposed Project is to reduce the poverty of the coastal \ncommunities in Papua New Guinea through infrastructure and capacity development \nparticularly in the management of coastal resources. Social surveys of coastal fishers \nwere undertaken in five coastal locations. Consultations were held with various fishers, \ncommunity members, government official business people, nongovernment organization \nrepresentatives, and others who might have a direct interest in the infrastructure facilities \nand harbor improvements being proposed, or in the community-based management \nactivities undertaken. The social surveys were conducted at sites where the provision of \nnew or improved infrastructure would generate significant social benefits.  \n \nA.  Survey Methodology \n \n2.  Participatory  rural  appraisal,  using  questionnaires  and  structured  interview \ntechniques, were used to standardize the information collected. A rapid focused group \nassessment  was  done  to  examine  HIV/AIDS  issues1  affecting  employees  of  the \ncommercial fishing industries, artisanal fishers, and processing workers.  \n \nB.  Socioeconomic Information \n \n1.  Poverty Indicators \n \n3.  The United Nations Development Programme calculates the human development \nindex as a composite of 3 factors: (i) longevity, as measured by life expectancy at birth; \n(ii) educational attainment as measured by a combination of adult literacy (2/3 weight) \nand the combined gross enrolment ratio (1/3 weight); and (iii) standard of living as \nmeasured by gross domestic product. PNG, as classified by these indicators, measures \n0.314, in the low human development category (under 0.5), along with countries such as \nBurundi and Mali. \n \n4.  The gender related developmental index is similar to human development index \nexcept that it shows the level of development of women. In PNG this is 0.318. Once \nagain anything under 0.5 is low and this figure of 0.318 puts PNG 159th out of 175 \ncountries where it has been measured. The gender related developmental index also \nreflects quality of life using indicators such as leading a long life, being knowledgeable, \nand enjoying a decent standard of living. \n \n2.  Poverty \n5.  A comprehensive analysis of poverty and access to public services in PNG was \nprepared by the World Bank in 19992 based on information from the 1996 Household \nSurvey. This estimated that 37% of the population could be considered as poor, or living \nbelow the national poverty line. Poverty is more prevalent in rural areas, with 41% of the \nrural population is considered as living below the poverty line.  \n \n                                                 \n1 HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n2  World Bank. 1999. Papua New Guinea: Poverty and Access to Public Services, Report No. 19584-PNG. \nWashington. ", "42  Appendix 6 \n6.  The survey took into account access to social services such as education, health \ncare, rural infrastructure, transport, and utilities. Access to these services is substantially \nworse for the lower income groups and for those living in more isolation. In this regard \nthe coastal communities are comparatively worse off and have a greater proportion of \nhouseholds falling under the poverty line. The Momase/North Coast region has the \nhighest incidence and extent of poverty in PNG, contributing 36% to the national total.  \n \n3.  Coastal Fishing Communities \n7.  In all the sites visited, women were the ones responsible for the sale of family \nproducts (although their husbands take the cash and manage the money). Most of the \ntime, because of the duration of the trip to the town market,3 and the lack of ice, the \nwomen also process the fish they are selling (reef and pelagic fish, shells, and  crabs, \nwhich are cooked or smoked). This adds labor time to the product but reduces its value \nby half at least. Most of the women interviewed during the present study came from rural \nareas (coastal villages) and belong to the 39% of the nonremunerated part of the total \neconomically active population who rely on subsistence farming and fishing activities.  \n8.  A survey carried out from July to August 1996 under the Coastal Fisheries \nDevelopment Project4 in Lae shows that, in the three villages monitored, even if the \nsurvey  fell  outside  the  main  fishing  season,  fishing  activities  represented  the  most \nimportant single source of cash income. Revenues from fishing accounted for between \n38\u201474% of cash income in the households.  \n9.  At market, the women have to face competition from the other villages, most of \nthem selling the same kind of products. To sell their merchandise\u2014which they might not \nmanage\u2014they also have to spend a long time in the market town. This may sometimes \nbe several days, very often in the most dreadful hygienic and comfort conditions (no \nwater, toilets, shelter; nowhere to sleep; lack of security, etc). They also have to pay a \n(small) fee to the town market, even if they are sitting on the floor. Having sold their \nproducts, the marketers go to the shops and buy the goods they need: food products \n(rice and sugar, sometimes vegetables) and/or nonfood products (kerosene and soap \nbeing the most usual ones). \n \n10.  The infrastructure recommended in this project at Alotau, Daru, and Lae should \ncover some of these women's basic needs on-site such as shelter, drinkable water, and \ntoilets  facilities.  Furthermore,  by  creating  a  hub  for  longliners  and  a  space  where \ninvestors can build fish processing facilities, they potentially open a market for the fish or \nother  more  valued  species  caught  by  the  women  from  coastal  villages  and  create \nopportunities for earning cash income.  \n \n11.  The other problems linked with poverty\u2014low literacy level, excessive workload \nlinked  with  PNG  cultural  aspects,  malnutrition,  linkage  with  finance  providers \n(microfinance),  awareness  and  training  in  fisheries  (fishing  techniques,  market \nopportunities, conservation measures, bookkeeping and small business management)\u2014 \ncan only be addressed at the village level. Whatever benefits the new infrastructure is \ndirectly  and  indirectly  providing,  they  will  not  arise  if  those  very  problems  are  not \n                                                 \n3  In Morobe Province, the furthest villages can be located 150 or even 200 kilometers (km) away and the \nmaximum distances between fishing grounds and Lae market can reach up to 200 km.  \n4  Moma Coastal Fisheries Development Project, Technical Cooperation Papua New Guinea and the \nFederal Republic of Germany. ", "Appendix 6  43\naddressed at the community level. Consequently, these aspects will be addressed under \nthe fisheries management support component of the Project. \n \nC.  Gender Issues \n \n12.  Women are major participants in the PNG fishing industry even if they are not \noften credited for it. They are responsible for a large proportion of subsistence fishing, \nare becoming increasingly involved in artisanal fishing for commercial purposes, carry \nout most of the marketing of the artisanal catch (including smoking and other types of \nartisanal processing), and undertake all the processing of PNG\u2019s industrial fish catch. \nDevelopment of PNG fisheries will rely heavily on the participation of women. However, \ndespite their importance to both small-scale and large-scale fishing in PNG, women \nhave little or no say in resource management, small-scale development, or industry \nplanning. As in other sectors of the PNG economy, they remain second-class citizens \nwith no economic power or political influence.  \n \n13.  The project design provides for the conduct of gender awareness training at all \nlevels  and  throughout  the  project  life.  In  addition,  activities  promoting  small-scale \nfisheries development will be targeted to women wherever possible, in order to provide \nbusiness opportunities in which women can participate. This will be done using gender \nand development methodology in which gender becomes integrated into all project and \nmanagement activities.5  \n \nD.  HIV/AIDS in the PNG Fishing Industry \n \n14.  HIV/AIDS cases in PNG have risen exponentially in recent years, although it is \nstill considered to have low prevalence compared with some other countries. In June \n2001,  the  statistics  provided  by  the  National  AIDS  Council  Secretariat  revealed \ncumulative HIV/AIDS cases at 3,901 HIV, 1,366 AIDS, and 249 deaths. In 2001, 48% \nmore cases were reported than during the same period in 2000. Due to lack of testing, \ngeneralized figures are acknowledged to be unreliable, but in 2001, more than 20,000 \nindividuals HIV positive.  \n \n15.  In PNG, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a major public health problem \nespecially  for  women  in  the  reproductive  age  group.  Recently  this  has  become  of \nincreased importance because of the increasing prevalence of HIV infection; infection \nrates of STDs are being indicative of likely HIV/AIDS infection rates. A recent study on \nthe prevalence of HIV and STD found 3% of Lae-based sex workers and 16% of sex \nworkers in Port Moresby tested HIV positive. STD rates among sex workers were on \naverage 33% with syphilis; 32% with chlamydia, and 36% with gonorrhea. \n \n1.  Artisanal and Rural Fishers \n \n16.  Women who sell fish often do not earn enough after the sale of their catch at \nmarkets to pay for the trip home or for nonfood item purchases, and get forced by \ncircumstance into selling sex to make up for the shopping and transport fees. Places \n                                                 \n5  This contrasts with the women-specific approach, generally referred to as women in development, which \nsuffers from two drawbacks. First, it tends to contribute to the isolation of women from development \nactivities, and second, there is always a danger that such projects may be used as token indicators of \nefforts on behalf of women, without any strong policy commitment to incorporating women\u2019s role into the \noverall development process. ", "44  Appendix 6 \nwhere no water, toilet facilities and rest areas are available are difficult for female fish \ntraders wishing to stay overnight in the market town. Men provide security in exchange \nfor sex, while those who provide water, accommodation, and toilets sometimes insist on \ntrading these services for sex. Some women wait until dark to use the beach as a toilet, \nbut youths hang around to wait for opportunities to sexually assault women heading for \nthe beach. \n \na.  Proposed Activities \n17.  At present HIV/AIDS is taught at the National Fisheries College (NFC) in the first \naid course only. A Red Cross volunteer is teaching this subject. This is obviously not \nadequate and the Project will assist NFC to introduce a module on HIV/AIDS in every \ncourse and provide materials for the module. \n \n18.  The Project is expected to subcontract NFC to undertake the training. A domestic \nconsultant specialized in HIV/AIDS material preparation and awareness will provide \nshort-term assistance to NFC and tuna canneries, and possibly also to nongovernment \norganizations. The material will be targeted to cover most areas in the fishing industry \nand will be prepared in close collaboration with the National AIDS Council. ", "Appendix 7  45\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND BENEFITS \n \nA.  Approach and Basic Assumptions \n1.  The two components of the Project: fisheries management support and basic social \nstructures are not considered amenable to full economic analysis, although their benefits can be \nsignificant as discussed in paras 65 and 66 of the main text. This appendix presents economic \nanalysis of the capital investment component of the longline wharf at Voco Point in Lae. \n2.  The basic assumptions applied to the economic analysis here are the following.  \n(i)  Life of the subprojects is assumed to be 25 years.  \n(ii)  Prices used in the analysis were identified through a variety of secondary sources in \naddition to field trips to the proposed project sites. All benefits and costs are measured in \nconstant 2001 prices to exclude inflation by applying the World Bank\u2019s manufacturers unit \nvalue for traded components and gross domestic product deflator for local costs.  \n(iii)  Economic pricing was done using the world price numeraire with the national currency kina \nas the unit of account, based on an exchange rate of $1 = K3.846 prevailing in March \n2002.  \n(iv)  All  taxes  and  other  transfer  payments  are  removed  from  financial  costs  and  benefit \nstreams to convert financial prices into economic prices. A standard conversion factor of \n0.9 is applied to revalue nontraded goods and services at the world price level in the \nnational currency. \n(v)  Major tradable commodities (export grade sashimi and reef fish), are valued at border \nprices. \n(vi)  Project investment costs comprise actual financial costs for all civil works, design and \nsupervision, equipment, and vehicles.  \n(vii)  Marine  product  border  prices  are  adjusted  for  quality  differences,  transport,  handling, \nmarketing,  and  other  costs  to  determine  export  parity  price  at  local  wharves  where \nnecessary. \n \nB.  Subproject Analysis \n \n3.  The redeveloped and reconfigured wharf at Voco Point would provide sufficient space \nfor three longline vessels of 15\u201320 meters to berth at the same time, compared with space for \none at present and in the without project situation. The facilities could realistically be expected \nto be able to accommodate a fleet of 20 longliners based in Lae, provided that port visits to \nunload fish are staggered throughout the week to coincide with airfreight schedules. This can be \ncompared with the 5 vessels that currently use the harbor and the stated intention of the existing \nfishing companies to increase the number of vessels to around 10 in the near future.  \n4.  Conservatively, the benefit from the harbor development can be taken to be a net \nincrease of 7 longline vessels using the improved facilities, assuming that some increase in the \nnumber of boats will occur in the future regardless without the Project. The increased production \nfrom these vessels can be counted as a direct economic benefit based on the assumption that ", "46  Appendix 7 \nthe increase in production is a real increase in national fishing activity, not just a reallocation of \nfishing activities from other fishing ports. It can be further assumed that there will be an increase \nin efficiency and time savings for the number of longliners using the harbor now, and the \nplanned increase in numbers in the near future. More berth space and better facilities will allow \nvessels to be unloaded and resupplied more quickly, resulting in faster turnaround and a small \nincrease in fishing days per year. Demand for fresh fish is good and the Fisheries Department in \nMorobe Province considers that the market is undersupplied. In addition, Lae is the gateway to \nthe Highlands where many of the country\u2019s growing population live. \n \nC.  Economic impact \n5.  The quantifiable economic benefit is the production from 7 longliners made up of chilled \ntuna exported for the sashimi market and the value of by-catch sold on the local market. If the \ntotal incremental production is assumed to be 700 tons (t) per year (100 t per vessel) valued at \na net economic benefit of K1,933 per ton ($580) after allowing for the capital and operating \ncosts of a typical longliner, then the incremental benefit would amount to K1.353 million per year \n($406,000). In economic prices the capital costs of developing the wharf are estimated at K3.36 \nm  ($0.874  m)  and  the  annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  at  K168,000  ($44,000) \nrepresenting 5% of the capital costs.

Under these assumptions, the economic internal rate of return is 24%, which is indicative \nof the high returns expected from the export of chilled tuna for the sashimi market. \n \nC.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n9.  The economic returns from Voco Point harbor development have been tested for their \nsensitivity to changes in the main parameters of benefits and costs. The results have been \ntested through an increase in benefits of 10% from the base case, and conversely a 10% \ndecrease. A 10% decrease and 10% increase in project costs have also been applied.

The results show the Project is relatively insensitive to changes in benefits and costs \nand large changes in benefits and costs (switching values) are needed to reduce the ENPV to \nzero.  \n \nD.  Impact on Poverty \n \n11.  The Project will primarily affect rural coastal communities. An analysis of the 1994 \npopulation census1 indicated that a total of 130,000 households, or around 500,000 people were \nliving in coastal communities in the country. This group can be regarded as the people who \nwould be most affected by the Project. Of these, about 23% were engaged in fishing on a \nregular  basis,  with  about  60%  fishing  for  their  own  consumption  and  40%  for  their  own \nconsumption and for sale. Based on these figures, an estimated 30,000 households are actively \ninvolved in fishing, which at an average of five members per household represents 150,000 \npeople. The most recent population census of 2000 indicates that the country\u2019s population is \ngrowing at around 3% per year. Applying this percentage increase to the 1994 figures to allow \nfor the increase in population during the intervening 6 years increases the number of people \ninvolved directly in fishing to 179,000. This group would be the primary beneficiaries of the \nProject who would benefit directly from the outcome. In addition, a larger pool of secondary \nbeneficiaries would also benefit from the increased supply of fish, improved wharf facilities, and \nthe multiplier effects of an increase in disposable income in the community. This group would \ninvolve the larger coastal communities of around 500,000 people. \n \n                                                 \n1  National Statistics Office. 1994. PNG Populations Census. ", "Appendix 8  49\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n \n1.  This  appendix  presents  brief  findings  of  the  summary  initial  environmental \nexaminations for the development of a wharf in Lae near Voco Point, and jetties in \nSanderson Bay, at Voco Point, and in Daru. This appendix highlights only relevant and \nimportant issues. The complete report is provided in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nA.  Description of the Project \n2.  The objective of the proposed Project in Lae Harbor is (i) to meet the immediate \nneeds of fishery operators who are based in Lae and expected entrants to the tuna \nlongline fishery in the next 5\u201310 years, and (ii) to improve the conditions for, and \nefficiency of, the small boat operators who are presently forced to use the beach at Voco \nPoint. These improvements are expected to create spin-off economic opportunities and \nsocial benefits for coastal communities in Morobe Province. While, the objective of the \nProject in Sanderson Bay is to improve facilities and harbor conditions for small boat \noperators and the passengers they carry. These improvements are expected to increase \nthe efficiencies of the harbor users and provide social benefits in optimizing the links \nbetween sellers from the islands and transportation services in Alotau. The objective of \nthe Project in Daru is to provide small boat access to the onshore market and exporters. \nThese will improve services for the many small boat operators and marketers who need \nto access Daru.  \n \nB.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n1.  Environmental and Social Problems Due to Project Location \n \n3.  No  significant  negative  environmental  or  social  impacts  are  expected  with \nconstruction of facilities at Voco Point in Lae Harbor. The main reason for this conclusion \nis that the site is located within the port boundary. It is already influenced by port \nactivities, and the location does not support any sensitive coastal and marine habitats, \nsuch  as  coral  reefs,  seagrass  beds,  and  mangrove  forests.  The  simple  facilities \nproposed for the beach at Voco Point are intended solely for the benefit of the beach \nusers, and will involve only limited construction activity. \n \n4.  No  significant  negative  environmental  or  social  impacts  are  expected  with \nconstruction of a timber jetty, shore-based facilities, shore protection works, and harbor \nimprovements which are a function of their location in Sanderson Bay. The main reason \nfor this conclusion is that the project site is already influenced by harbor activities and \nthe bay only supports one limited but robust seagrass bed. A patch coral reef in the bay \nis almost completely dead and there are no mangrove forests. \n \n5.  No significant negative environmental impacts are expected with construction of \na timber wharf on piles, because no sensitive coastal or marine habitats are to be \naffected by the Project. ", "50  Appendix 8 \n2.  Environmental Impacts Associated with the Construction Stage \n \n6.  All environmental impacts associated with the construction phase of facilities at \nVoco Point are deemed to be insignificant, because of the absence of any sensitive \ncoastal and marine habitats in the vicinity. Impacts would be short-lived in any case. The \nmain effects of construction activities will be disturbance of marine sediments during \ndriving of piles. This temporary disturbance of sediments will not have a significant \nimpact on the area. However, during this construction stage more congestion than usual \nwill result at the remaining wharves for at least several months. The construction of the \nbeach ramp will also cause a disruption of normal use of the beach by dinghies. This \nproblem can be minimized by completing installation of the pontoon wharf first, which will \nprovide shore access for dinghies while the beach ramp is constructed. Construction of \nthe beach ramp should not take long, in any case. \n \n7.  All  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  phase  of  the \nSanderson subproject are deemed to be insignificant, mostly because of the small scale \nof the subproject and the location in an area with completely dead patches of reef. The \nmain physical effects of construction activities will be limited to disturbance of marine \nsediment during driving of piles and during dredging near the creek. This temporary \ndisturbance  of  sediment  is  not  expected  to  have  much  effect  on  the  project  area. \nHowever, the explosion could cause mortality of fish that may be in Sanderson Bay at \nthe time of the activity. The project design recommends a pile driver to break up the \ndead coral rubble and that the rubble be dredged up and used for fill at the shore \nprotection site. Construction of three small sediment traps in the creek will be required, \nand should be undertaken when flow in the creek is minimal. No significant creek habitat \nwill be affected by construction of the traps (most of the creek is vegetated with grass \nand cluttered with debris). Boat access to the beach at the head of Sanderson Bay will \nbe restricted somewhat during construction of the jetty. Construction of the transit house \nand the terminal will also force people to walk around the site. \n \n8.  All environmental impacts associated with the construction phase of the Daru \nWharf subproject are deemed to be insignificant, mostly because of its small scale and \nthe  absence  of  any  sensitive  coastal  and  terrestrial  habitats  at  the  site.  The  main \nphysical effects of construction activities will be limited disturbance of marine sediment \nduring driving of piles. This temporary disturbance of sediment is not expected to have \nany measurable effect in the area because of strong tidal currents. The small workforce \nrequired during construction will not have any measurable impact on waste inputs to the \narea. \n \n3.  Environmental/ Social Problems Resulting from Project Operations \n \n9.  Few environmental and social problems are anticipated with the operation of the \nVoco  Point  facilities  in  Lae  Harbor,  operation  of  the  jetty  in  Sanderson  Bay,  and \noperation  of  timber  jetty  in  Daru.  The  increased  vessel  and  shore-based  activity \nassociated with the Project will lead to an increase in vessel waste, which will require \ntreatment  and  storage  facilities.  Waste  management  strategies  for  the  Voco  Point, \nSanderson Bay and Daru area will include collection, storage, and disposal of all solid \nwaste from vessels that tie up at the new facilities, and enforcement of regulations that \nspecify no bilge pumping and no tank flushing in the harbor. The risk of fuel spills will \nalso  increase  with  increased  vessel  activity,  so  fuel  spill  contingency  plans  and \nassociated training will be specified in the operation of the new facilities. Strategies to ", "Appendix 8  51\nreduce the risk of fuel spills will include transfer of fuel only during daylight hours and \nonly involve vessels tied directly to the wharf. Fuelspill, clean-up equipment, including a \nboom and sorbents, should be provided in a container on the wharf, and dockside staff \ntrained in the deployment and use of the equipment. The fuelspill contingency plan, \nincluding use of the equipment, should be practiced on an annual basis. \n \nC.  Institutional  Requirements,  Required  Studies,  and  Environmental \nMonitoring Program \n10.  The responsibility for future environmental management of the proposed wharf \nand facilities at these three subproject areas will lie with the National Fisheries Authority, \nin association with the Harbors Board. These entities represent government interest in \nthe facilities, and must ensure that the contractor who builds the facilities addresses and \nincorporates  all  the  required  mitigation  measures  that  have  been  specified  in  this \ndocument. The proponent should work with the Office of Environment and Conservation \nto implement the monitoring program. \n \n11.  The monitoring will be done at regular intervals. Specific environmental variables, \nwhich may be directly affected by construction and operation of the wharf and beach \nfacilities will include in situ analysis undertaken on a quarterly basis for measurement of \nhydrocarbons, nutrients (ammonia, nitrates, phosphate), dissolved oxygen, salinity and \ntemperature, and suspended particulate matter. \n \nD.  Conclusions \n12.  This initial environmental examination has determined that the proposed wharf \nextension and beach facilities at Voco Point in Lae Harbor and Sanderson Bay, as well \nas  the  construction  of  facilities  in  Daru  can  be  constructed  and  operated  with  no \nsignificant negative environmental impacts. Therefore, no further environmental study or \nenvironmental impact assessment is required. Subject to the implementation of specified \nmitigation  measures  and  environmental  and  social  benefits  monitoring,  the  Project \nshould be able to proceed without any significant negative effects. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20021003161036Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20021109103108+08'00'"}}
