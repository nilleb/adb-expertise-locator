INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the December 2009 country programming mission, consultations between the \ngovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhighlighted the need to provide support for capacity development to enhance the development \nimpact of ADB operations in the country. The government asked ADB to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to help build capacity of client agencies in the country. Subsequent discussions \nwere held with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost,  and  financing  arrangements  of  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB started its PRC operations in 1986. ADB has been a trusted partner and extended \nassistance of over $23.0 billion for lending and nonlending operations. Currently, 68 loans and \n98 TA projects are under implementation, and 39 loans are proposed for approval in the next  \n3 years (2010\u20132012). ADB support has been well focused and closely aligned with the country\u2019s \ndevelopment priorities. As the PRC has progressed, the development needs have changed and \nADB  operations  are  being  realigned  both  in  sectoral  and  geographic  contexts.  ADB  is \ndiversifying its operations into the areas of climate change, agriculture and rural development, \nsustainable urban development, sustainable transport, and microfinance. Geographically, ADB \noperations are moving from eastern and central parts of the country to the poorer and more \nremote western regions. Also, most executing and implementing agencies for ADB projects are \nnow provincial and local government entities as compared with central ministries and agencies \nin  the  past.  This  shift  in  ADB  operations  has  its  challenges  relating  to  institutional, \norganizational, and individual capacity.  \n3.  In addition, ADB has taken a number of steps to make its operations more responsive \nand flexible to client needs. Beginning in January 2010, ADB implemented streamlined business \nprocesses to make its loan delivery processes more efficient (reduced response time and better \nquality) and reduce transaction costs. However, to achieve the full benefits of these processes, \ndomestic approval procedures must be streamlined\u2014capacity is a key issue. ADB\u2019s Safeguards \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  for  streamlined  safeguard  due  diligence  became  effective  on  \n20 January 2010. However, with ADB diversifying its operations geographically with multiple \ncomponents  in  many  new  and  complex  areas  and  less-experienced  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, safeguard due diligence is challenging and needs proper capacity-\nbuilding  support.  To  meet  these  diverse  development  needs,  ADB  is  introducing  different \nfinancing  modalities  such  as  the  multitranche  financing  facility,  nonsovereign  lending, \ncomplementary financing, and guarantees in its PRC operations, all requiring increased client \nawareness.  \n4.  In 2009, ADB signed a memorandum of agreement with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nfor the pilot delegation of TA administration to executing agencies (EAs)1. Nine TA projects were \nagreed for delegation in 2010 and assessments were conducted to determine the capacity of \nthe EAs to administer them. The assessment determined that capacity building support in ADB \npolicies and procedures is required for these  EAs for the successful implementation of the \ndelegated projects. \n                                              \n  1 In the long term, the strategy of ADB is to shift from direct TA administration by ADB to ADB oversight of TA \nadministered by executing agencies and other entities. (ADB.2009.Policy on Increasing the Impact of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Technical Assistance Program. Manila [Section 51]). \n ", "2     \n5.  ADB  has  one  of  its  largest  portfolio\u2019s  in  the  PRC.  The  size  of  the  portfolio  is  not \nexpected to change, but the number of projects is likely to increase. Overall, the PRC portfolio \nhas been performing well, but shortcomings include delays in loan start-up activities, project \nimplementation,  and  disbursement  processing.  Discussions  with  the  government  and \nstakeholders  during  the  country  portfolio  review  missions  revealed  that  delays  in  project \nimplementation are largely caused by lack of familiarity with ADB requirements and guidelines. \nImproving the knowledge, skills, and experience of executing and implementing agency staff \nthrough regular training, and streamlining project implementation procedures are identified as \ncritical for better portfolio performance.  \n6.  ADB is also formulating a new country partnership strategy for the PRC, in line with the \ncountry\u2019s 12th Five Year Plan. The strategy is expected to focus on less-developed central and \nwestern regions and provide assistance in the areas of climate change, agriculture and rural \ndevelopment, sustainable urban development, sustainable transport, and microfinance. Such a \ngeographic and sectoral change in ADB strategy and programs will create challenges for project \ndesign and implementation for complex projects spanning multiple sectors and/or subsectors, \nlocation of project sites in remote parts of the western regions of the country, and multiagency \ncoordination. These challenges, coupled with inadequate staff capacity in many of the new \nexecuting agencies and local implementing agencies in small cities or counties, could impede \nthe smooth implementation of projects.  \n7.  Capacity development is one of ADB's thematic priorities of Strategy 2020 aimed at \nenhancing the effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of ADB interventions.2 Strengthened \ncountry capacity will contribute to the achievement of better public sector performance. Capacity \ndevelopment  is  particularly  important  as  ADB-financed  projects  are  increasingly  moving  to \npoorer western provinces where problems of weak financial management, institutional capacity, \nand corporate governance are more acute.  \n8.  Therefore, to address the capacity development needs of the PRC, the TA will support \nhuman  resource  development,  institutional  development,  and  organizational  development \nthrough a wide range of institutional, organizational, and individual capacity-building activities. \nThe TA will seek to (i) equip individuals with understanding, skills, knowledge, and training to  \nenable them to perform effectively; (ii) help enable organizations, institutions, and agencies at \nall levels and in all sectors to enhance their capacities; and (iii) assist in establishing better \nmanagement structures and processes within the agencies and between different agencies and \nsectors (public, private, and community). The TA will provide cost-effective unified capacity \ndevelopment support, which will reduce the need for ad-hoc actions and reduce transaction \ncosts. The TA will supplement current efforts3 to strengthen institutional capacities of executing \nand implementing agencies for better project management by delivering training programs to \nthese agencies, facilitating knowledge transfer, and showcasing good practices. \n9.  The  TA  will  strengthen  institutional  capacity  by  properly  defining  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  government  entities,  particularly  provincial  governments,  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, and other project stakeholders throughout the project cycle (comprising \nproject identification, formulation and design, approval, implementation, and monitoring and \nevaluation), including those concerned with safeguard policies, thematic priorities, and sector \npolicies. The TA will also help in identifying issues and making recommendations for aligning \n                                              \n2  ADB. 2008.

The TA will systematically train executing and implementing agencies to strengthen their \ncapacity to design, manage, implement, monitor, and operate ADB-financed projects. The TA \nwill promote knowledge sharing by identifying project success stories  and showcasing best \nexamples of value additions, which will help promote transfer and dissemination of knowledge, \ntechnology, best practices, and reform initiatives for possible replication and spillover influences \nin other projects, provinces, and entities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.   The impact of the TA will be increased development impact of ADB assistance to the \nPRC. The achievement of this impact will be demonstrated through improved country portfolio \nperformance and higher client satisfaction. The TA outcome will be enhanced human resource \ndevelopment,  and  institutional  and  organizational  capacity  of  client  agencies.  Success  in \nachieving the outcome will be measured by reduced loan processing time, improved project \nimplementation, increased use of new ADB lending modalities, and successful implementation \nof nine delegated TA projects. The TA assumes that ADB will enhance its involvement to \nsupport development activities in the PRC under the government\u2019s 12th Five Year Plan. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  will  carry  out  capacity  building  programs  and  activities  to  enhance  client \nagencies\u2019  awareness  of  and  skills  in  (i)  all  aspects  of  project  design,  appraisal,  and \nimplementation;  (ii)  operating  procedures  under  ADB\u2019s  streamlined  business  processes;  \n(iii) implementation and monitoring of safeguard action plans under ongoing projects financed \nby ADB including those being processed; (iv) administration and implementation of delegated \nTA  activities;  and  (v)  new  ADB  initiatives  (online  system  under  eOperations,  knowledge \npartnerships, and new areas of operations, e.g., technical and vocational education). The TA \nwill promote horizontal learning and knowledge exchange, identify capacity development needs, \nselect  target  beneficiaries  and  participants,  and  promote  enhanced  partnerships  through \ncapacity building activities.  \n13.  Key activities include assessing training needs; developing suitable training programs; \nconducting training workshops, training visits, and knowledge exchange programs; distributing \ntraining materials; and conducting client surveys. Training under the TA will include project \nplanning  and  design,  procurement,  consulting  services,  disbursements,  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguards,  performance  monitoring,  financial  management,  project \nmanagement, and anticorruption. Targeted participants may include directors, managers, and \nkey project management staff of executing and implementing agencies; as well as officials from \nline  ministries,  provincial  finance  departments,  and  provincial  development  and  reform \ncommissions. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1.8  million  equivalent;  ADB  will  provide  \n$1.5 million equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF\u2013Others).  The  government  will  provide  an  in-kind  contribution  of  \n ", "4     \n$0.3 million equivalent, through the provision of counterpart staff, office space and utilities, \ntransport,  and  other  support  activities,  including  access  to  data.  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOF, as the executing agency, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring TA \nactivities. A steering committee\u2014comprising representatives of relevant departments of MOF \nand ADB\u2014will be set up to oversee implementation, and provide guidance and direction to the \nconsultants. The composition of the steering committee will be finalized at TA inception.  In \naddition, MOF will appoint a project coordinator who will supervise and coordinate day-to-day \nTA activities, including monitoring of progress, resolving problems, arranging meetings, and \nliaising with concerned government agencies. To facilitate the work  of the consultants  and \nensure that MOF benefits from their experience, MOF will provide adequate counterpart staff \nwith relevant work experience during TA implementation. The steering committee will provide \nguidance for the organization of programs, workshops, seminars, selection of participants, and \nother  TA  activities.  A  TA  coordinator  may  be  recruited  to  support  TA  implementation,  be \nresponsible for daily coordination of various TA activities, preparation of quarterly TA progress \nreports, and liaison with MOF and ADB.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented from January 2011 to  December 2013. It will require \nabout 8 person-months of international  and  about 55 person-months of national consulting \nservices  to  carry  out  the  terms  of  reference  (Appendix  3).  The  international  and  national \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  training  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  institutional \ndevelopment,  (iii)  project  management,  (iv)  procurement  and  consulting  services,  \n(v) disbursement, (vi) social development, (vii) resettlement, (viii) environment, and (ix) audit \nand  financial  management.  TA  and  workshop  coordinators  may  be  appointed  after \ndiscussions with the steering committee. The steering committee will discuss and finalize \nthe required expertise and detailed terms of reference for specific assignments, including \nduration and expected results. Additional international and national resource persons and \nshort-term task-specific experts will be recruited to carry out well-defined tasks (e.g., case \nstudy  papers,  workshop  presentations,  participation  in  workshops,  and  review  of  draft \nreports).  \n \n17.  All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The consultants will be recruited on an \nindividual basis since varied expertise will be required for the short-term engagement, the \nmain requirements of the assignments are for individual qualifications and experience, and \nthe  assignments  are  more  on  individual  basis.  A  firm  could  have  difficulty  providing \nmultidisciplinary expertise over the 3-year implementation period as required by the TA. The \nTA  and workshop coordinators will  be  responsible  for team coordination  and leadership \nwork. Given the nature of the TA and to facilitate preparation and implementation of the \ntraining and workshops, ADB may establish an advance payment facility as needed and/or \nutilize direct payment to workshop sponsors and workshop venues. \n \n18.  Procurement of equipment, supplies, and materials by consultants under the TA will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended time to time).The equipment will be turned over to MOF after TA \ncompletion.  \n \n ", "  5 \n \nIV.
