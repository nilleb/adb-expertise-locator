INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2010 country programming mission, the Government of the People's Republic \nof China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance \n(TA) to support reforms in fiscal policy, taxation, and budget management. The PRC country \npartnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010  under  the  pillar  \"inclusive  growth  and  development,\" \nemphasizes  support  for  fiscal  reforms  to  strengthen  central  and  provincial  government \nresources and to promote the development of poor interior provinces.1 A TA fact-finding mission \nheld detailed discussions on 6\u20139 April 2010 with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State \nAdministration of Taxation on the TA objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, \nand terms of reference. This report reflects ADB's findings and understandings reached with the \ngovernment on the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2    \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Taxation Reform \n2.  Tax structure. The PRC tax structure differs in some important aspects from that of \nmember countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \nThe share of indirect taxes in government revenue is 43%, significantly above the OECD \naverage. Company taxation produces a yield similar to that in OECD countries, but personal \nincome tax and social security contributions are of much less importance. Tax bases for value-\nadded and excise taxes are small compared with international good practice. Despite progress \non curbing extrabudgetary funds,3 all levels of government continue to raise large amounts of \nfunds  in  nontransparent  ways  outside  the  regular  budget  process.  Off-budget  government \nrevenue remains large and unreported.  \n \n3.  Formal  revenue  system.  Since  economic  reforms  began  in  1978,  the  budgetary \nrevenue proportion of gross domestic product declined from 31.2% in 1978 to 10.7% in 1995, \nand then increased to 20.0% in 2008. The formal government tax revenue system remains \nrelatively weak compared with international standards, and boundaries between the government \nand nongovernment sector are neither well defined nor stable. \n \n4.  Tax  system  and  macroeconomic  development.  Tax  reform  is  critical  to  support \nsustainable macroeconomic, social, and environmental development. The comparatively low \nlevel of core public services in the PRC, particularly for education, health, and social security, \nare  often  considered  to  be  a  major  reason  for  the  high  household  saving  rate.  As  a \nconsequence, growth of the PRC economy has largely been driven by exports and investment, \nrather than consumption. Implementing policies to lower precautionary savings (i.e., reforming \nhealth,  education,  and  pension  systems,  which  may  require  additional  tax  revenue)  could \nincrease private consumption and support growth in a sustainable manner. \n \n5.  Intergovernmental tax-sharing. The PRC is a decentralized country, consisting of five \nlevels of government: national, provincial, city, county, and township. The 1994 tax reform \nintroduced  tax-sharing  to  shift  revenue  collection  from  a  negotiated  basis  to  a  formal  tax \nassignment and sharing system between the central and provincial governments. Revenue \nassignments for local governments through the tax-sharing system are not properly linked to \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People's Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 April 2010. \n3  Extrabudgetary funds are legally sanctioned fees, surcharges, user charges, and other levies, which are raised \noutside the regular budget process, while off-budgetary funds are illegal. \n ", "2   \nspending  mandates.  Tax  authority  remains  vested  with  the  central  government;  local \ngovernments have limited powers to set rates for a few local taxes. Transfers from the central to \nthe  local  governments  are  sizable,  but  do  not  provide  sufficient  financial  support  for  the \nprovision of essential public services. Marked differences in revenue-generating capacity across \nprovinces and lower levels of government have increased regional inequality. In combination \nwith lack of tax autonomy, they have created incentives for local authorities to rely on extra- and \noff-budget  sources  for  revenue,  accumulate  arrears,  and  circumvent  official  borrowing \nrestrictions by indirectly borrowing through investment vehicles. \n \n6.  Reform of the tax system in line with international best practice, including modernizing \nthe tax structure, tax administration, and in particular intergovernment tax sharing, is critical to \nadapt the economy to the changing role of government and evolving external environment, \nensure effective resource mobilization, achieve high sustainable growth, and equalize regional \nincome disparities. \n \nB.  Financial Policy to support the Sustainable Development of Resource-Based \nCities and Enterprises \n7.  The PRC faces serious environmental challenges, including pollution and depletion of \nnatural resources. Resource-based cities4 are particularly exposed to environmental pollution, \nlow diversification, vulnerability to shocks, resource depletion, and occupational accidents and \ndiseases. While extractive industries can create significant opportunities for economic growth \nand  public  sector  revenue,  they  often  impede  sustainable  development  through  adverse \nenvironmental  and  socioeconomic  impacts,  and  encouragement  of  dependence  on  the \ngenerated revenues. Local governments often lack resources to provide basic public goods \nsuch as environmental protection and social services; additional resource revenue collection \nand management mechanisms need to be established. \n \n8.  The Sustainable Development Reserve and Fund (SDRF) policy, recently approved by \nthe State Council, will collect revenue through a levy on enterprises in extractive industries. Part \nof the revenue will be retained in the enterprises as reserve to address the negative effects of \nmining,  the  remainder  will  be  allocated  as  earmarked  transfers  to  the  budget  of  local \ngovernments of resource-based cities. MOF is responsible for implementation of the SDRF \npolicy. Based on clearly defined policy objectives, the funds will be used for environmentally and \neconomically sustainable investments.  \n \nC.  Treasury Management and Budget Execution Monitoring \n9.  Treasury reform is the primary focus of activities to improve the government's ability to \ncontrol  and  monitor  budget  implementation.  In  2001,  MOF  initiated  this  reform  with  the \nintroduction of the treasury single account (TSA).5 TSA implementation, in combination with an \nautomated  treasury  accounting  system,  provides  information  needed  by  MOF  to  increase \neffective real-time monitoring and control of expenditure, and better enforce compliance with \nbudget execution. The provinces are starting to set up TSAs, but substantial weaknesses \nremain for subnational and, in particular, subprovincial governments. \n                                                \n4  The term \"resource-based\" is used here to cover cities and enterprises that derive a substantial part of production \nand income from natural resource extraction. The principal focus is on production of hydrocarbon (oil and gas) and \nmining. According to MOF statistics, the PRC has 118 resource-based cities, i.e., 18% of cities in the country. With \ntwo-thirds of mines entering middle and old age, one-fourth of resource-based cities are facing resource depletion. \n5  A standard TSA is a bank account or a set of linked bank accounts under the supervision and control of the \nTreasury Department through which the government (including its entities and spending units) transacts all receipts \nand payments, and consolidates its cash balances. \n ", "  3 \n \n10.  The greatest challenge for budget management in the PRC is the high degree of fiscal \ndecentralization;  the  four  subnational  governments  account  for  80%  of  government \nexpenditures, with the third and fourth tiers accounting for the greatest share. The five levels of \nadministration comprise more than 44,000 government units. The central government finances \nabout half of local expenditures through intergovernment transfers. Special purpose grants6 \nrepresent the majority of transfers, excluding tax rebates, and reflect the central government\u2019s \nproactive regional policy. They also challenge transparency of the system. \n \n11.  Real-time monitoring of budget execution by the Treasury Department is currently limited \nto  expenditure  by  the  central  government,  which  has  adopted  the  TSA  system,  while  the \nTreasury Department lacks the instruments to track in real-time the flow of funds through the \nmultiple accounts of various tiers of local governments to the final beneficiaries. Allocated \nresources do not necessarily reach the intended recipients.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be strengthened fiscal policy, taxation, and budget management in the \nPRC. The outcome will be the design of an improved fiscal, taxation, and budget management \nframework. Related interventions by other development partners include a study by the United \nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on monitoring earmarked fiscal transfers from the central to \nlocal governments for education and rural health care. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA comprises three components: (i) a study on further deepening tax system reform, \n(ii) a framework for financial policy to support sustainable development of resource-based cities \nand enterprises, and (iii) support for implementation of the TSA and a real-time monitoring \nsystem  for  budget  execution.  Studies  of  the  components  will  be  published  as  knowledge \nproducts\u2014policy and technical notes for researchers and senior policy and decision makers. \n \n14.  Study  on  further  deepening  tax  system  reform.  The  TA  will  build  on  previous \nresearch and prepare an in-depth study of the tax system and general principles for mid- and \nlong-term tax reform, including reports on: \n(i)  rationalizing  the  tax  structure  in  line  with  good  international  practice  by \nbroadening the tax base, simplifying tax structure, extending budget coverage to \nextrabudgetary  revenue,  simplifying  and  keeping  down  the  costs  of  tax \nadministration and compliance, and increasing transparency; \n(ii)  determining the optimal formal tax revenue proportion of gross domestic product; \n(iii)  the  interaction  between  tax  system  reform  and  sustainable  macroeconomic \ndevelopment; and  \n(iv)  reform  of  the  intergovernment  tax-sharing  system  by  (a)  establishing  a \ntransparent framework for effective, efficient, and equitable tax revenue sharing \nbetween the central and local governments; (b) providing local authorities with \nsufficient  resources  to  fund  required  public  services;  (c) developing  a  new, \nrevenue-rich  local  government  tax;  and  (d)  exploring  options  to  extend  the \npowers of local government to levy taxes. \n  \n                                                \n6  Specific-purpose grants are designated transfers allocated on an ad hoc negotiated basis.  \n ", "4   \n15.  Particular emphasis will be placed on reform of the intergovernment tax-sharing system. \nThe study will guide tax reform under the 12th Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n \n16.  Framework for financial policy to support sustainable development of resource-\nbased  cities. The  scope for  using taxes,  levies,  and fees  to  increase  the  contribution of \nenterprises  in  extractive  industries  to  poverty  reduction  and  sustainable  development  is \nsignificant.  Structural  weaknesses  in  the  current  tax  system,  intergovernmental  tax-sharing \nsystem,  and  tax  administration  require  the  creation  of  special  resource  revenue  and \nmanagement  mechanisms  to  provide  timely  and  adequate  support  for  the  sustainable \ndevelopment of resource-based cities, in addition to relying on the regular budget process.  \n \n17.  Based on extensive previous research by MOF\u2019s Enterprise Department, the TA will \ndevelop the foundation for a framework for the SDRF policy based on international experience, \ndraft implementing regulations, and explore opportunities to coordinate the SDRF policy with \nstrengthened environmental taxation within the framework of general tax reform through close \ncooperation  with  component  1.  The  main  building  blocks  of  the  SDRF  policy  include  the \ninstitutional  and  governance  structure  of  the  resource  revenue  and  management  systems; \ndesign of an appropriate system of levies (including levy base and rates); allocation of revenue \nbetween eligible beneficiaries and projects; and establishment of an effective operations and \nfinancial monitoring, evaluation, and audit system. \n \n18.  Support for implementation of a real-time monitoring system for budget execution. \nThe  TA  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  TSA,  including  optimal  intergovernmental \nintegration,  and  a  nationwide  real-time  budget  monitoring  system,  in  particular  for  special \npurpose grants from the central to subnational governments, and provide training to central and \nlocal government officials.  \n \n19.  The TA will prepare an in-depth study on implementing a real-time monitoring system for \nbudget execution, consisting of three reports:  \n(i)  The first report will analyze the current status of (a) implementation of the TSA \nand central treasury accounting system for subnational governments, including \nintegration  with  the  central  government,  (b)  real-time  monitoring  of  budget \nexecution for all levels of government, (c) legal basis for the central government \ntreasury  function  and  budget  monitoring  of  subnational  governments,  and  \n(d) subnational government reporting and disclosure of budget execution. The \nreport will provide an overview of relevant concepts in line with international good \npractice.  \n(ii)  The  second  report  will  (a)  develop  the  required  design  and  capacity  of  a \ncountrywide  information  technology  management  information  system  for \npayments  and  possibly  transactions  at  all  stages  of  the  expenditure  cycle, \nsupporting  implementation  of  the  TSA  and  real-time  monitoring  of  budget \nexecution; (b) assess appropriate electronic connections between the People's \nBank of China, MOF, line ministries, local treasury offices, and spending units, \nconsidering weak communication links to some parts of country; and (c) identify \ntraining needs in implementing management information systems.  \n(iii)  The third report will develop the framework for the complete implementation and \noptimal integration of the TSA and for a real-time budget monitoring system at all \nlevels of government. The report will develop (a) a strategy for implementing real-\ntime  monitoring  of  budget  execution  at  all  government  levels;  \n(b)  an  implementation  plan  including  computerization;  (c) requirements  for \nintegrated payment and accounting systems; (d) a comprehensive, reliable, and \n ", "  5 \ntimely fiscal reporting system for improved transparency; and (e) an assessment \nof capacity building needs of local governments.  \n \n20.  The TA will closely cooperate with the ADB TA for Supporting Fiscal Reforms in High \nPriority  Sectors,  which  is  providing  support for  designing  local treasury  cash management \nsystems.7 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,400,000 equivalent, of which $1,200,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014others). The \ngovernment  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $200,000  through  the  provision  of  office \naccommodation, transport, remuneration, and per diem of counterpart staff (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  MOF\u2019s  International  Department  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  implementing \nagencies  will  be  (i)  for  the  first  component:  the  Policy  and  Law  Department  of  the  State \nAdministration of Taxation and MOF\u2019s Tax Policy Department; (ii) for the second component: \nMOF\u2019s Enterprise Department; and (iii) for the third component: MOF\u2019s Treasury Department. \nSenior advisory committees comprising ministerial and department representatives will provide \nsupervision. The TA will engage a team of three international consultants to provide 7 person-\nmonths of services and 14 national experts to provide 66 person-months of services. Activities \nare expected to commence in August 2010; the project will be closed in December 2012. \n \n23.  MOF\u2019s International Department, in consultation with the implementing agencies and \nwith ADB support, will be responsible for administering national training programs, seminars, \ninternational  workshops,  in-country  study  visits,  and  international  study  tours.  Due  to  the \ndiversity of the three components, a single firm cannot provide well-qualified consultants for the \nentire project. Component 1 will recruit a firm to provide national consultants. The smaller \ncomponents 2 and 3 will recruit individual consultants. If no appropriate firm(s) can be identified \nfor component 1 the consultants will be recruited on an individual basis. For recruitment of a firm, \nthe  preferred  selection  method  for  consultants  is  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  with  a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The international consultants will be recruited on an individual basis. \nThe TA  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China for Supporting Reforms in Taxation and \nBudget Management, and hereby reports such action to the Board. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2008.
