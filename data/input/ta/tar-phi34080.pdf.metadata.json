INTRODUCTION \n1.  Cleaner  production  (CP)  is  the  continuous  use  of  preventive  and  integrated \nenvironmental management strategies related to production processes, services, and products \nto improve an organization\u2019s profitability as well as to reduce risks to human health and the \nenvironment.  CP  principles  are  now  widely  recognized  as  one  of  the  major  strategies  for \npursuing  sustainable  developments.  The  Government  of  the  Philippines  asked  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for advisory technical assistance (TA) to promote CP to industries to \nstrengthen their competitiveness in international and domestic markets and reduce negative \nenvironmental impact. In December 2001 and April 2002, ADB missions were fielded to meet \nwith the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) to develop the objectives, scope, \ncosts, implementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference for the TA.1 The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. The TA is included in the 2002 TA program for the Philippines. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  While the Government has placed high priority on economic growth in its development \nplans, rapid industrialization and population growth have resulted in continued environmental \ndegradation. More notably, industries have engaged in inefficient processes that often discharge \nuntreated waste materials into the environment. Although this is one of the major causes of \nenvironmental  pollution,  industries  are  still  reluctant  to  establish  waste  treatment  systems \nbecause they see them as having additional overhead costs without any return. Such production \ninefficiencies,  and  the  globalization  of  markets,  may  render  the  Philippines\u2019  industries \nuncompetitive,  because  their  clients  and  potential  clients  require  and  will  require  them  to \nproduce goods in an environment-friendly manner. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) need \nmore good operating practices to remain competitive in domestic and international markets. \nThey need to upgrade their processes and equipment to minimize wastes to meet national and \ninternational standards. \n \n3.  In  finding  a  win-win  solution  to  deal  with  pollution  from  industrial  activities,  CP  is \nregarded as one of the promising approaches and consists of a wide range of market-based \nconcepts and practices, such as pollution prevention, opportunity assessment, environmental \nmanagement system (EMS), waste minimization and clean technology. Employing CP strategy \nand practice can increase the efficiency of natural resource use, minimize wastes, and reduce \npollution and risks to human health and safety at the source. In practice, CP modifies the \nmanufacturing process to reduce manufacturing inefficiencies, resulting in less waste discharge \nto  the  environment,  better  product  quality,  and  cheaper  products.  By  improving  overall \nproduction efficiency, CP also generates tangible economic savings for a business enterprise. \nUnlike common waste treatment or \u201cend-of-pipe\u201d technologies that impose a financial burden on \nindustries, CP often pays for itself within a year or so, however this has not been widely \ndisseminated to and acknowledged by industry. The Government has thus developed strategies \nand policy options2 to help establish a framework for a more sustainable industrial development \nscheme.  For  instance,  the  Bureau  of  Product  Standards  of  the  Department  of  Trade  and \nIndustry has adopted ISO14001: 19963 and associated guidelines for the auditing of EMS as \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 February 2002. \n2  ADB provided assistance through a regional TA (ADB. 1999. Promotion of Cleaner Production Policies and \nPractices in Selected Developing Member Countries. Manila) and Philippines, one of the five selected countries \nparticipating, prepared a national CP action plan.   \n3   ISO14001 is a standard developed by the International Organization of Standards, which specifies requirements \nfor an environmental management system, to enable an organization to formulate a policy and objectives taking \ninto account legislative requirements and information about significant environmental impacts. ", "2 \nPhilippine national standards. DOST has been trying to modify the ISO14001 EMS to make its \nadoption by SMEs easier. \n \n4.  As industries are beginning to implement good housekeeping practices to improve their \nefficiency and reduce waste generation, previous projects have made the industry sector more \naware of its role in preserving the environment while increasing its productivity. Nevertheless, \nthe results of these activities have not been fully disseminated, and industries, particularly \nSMEs, have yet to realize the full benefits of CP. CP has begun to take shape in the country but \nthe spread of its acceptance has been rather slow. Industries could push the limits of CP \nthrough  technology  change,  i.e.,  utilization  of  more  efficient  equipment  and  processes, \nautomation,  process  optimization,  and/or  layout  changes.  Further  more,  the  environmental \nperformance of industries would be improved significantly through adoption of CP, which will \nimprove environmental quality and benefit the poor\u2019s living environment. \n \n5.  In this regard, TA is needed, as well as more information on available CP strategies and \nclean technologies appropriate to the country\u2019s conditions. Aside from upgrading the technical \ncapabilities of Filipino providers of industrial extension services on CP, the industry sector \nneeds assistance to adopt sector-specific management practices and technologies to upgrade \nits  manufacturing  operations.  Training  manuals  and  sector-specific  best  environmental \nmanagement handbooks may be produced and updated by government agencies to guide \nindustries in adopting CP.  \n \n6.  The Government needs to support CP integration in industrial activities through industrial \ndevelopment policies that would promote CP. DOST has included the Integrated Program on \nCleaner Production Technologies as one of its flagship programs to assist SMEs in adopting \nappropriate clean technologies. Appendix 2 provides information on assistance provided by \ninternational institutions to the Government for industrial pollution reduction. However, these \nprojects focused mainly on industrial surveying, data collection, or preparatory study. Little has \nbeen done to demonstrate and evaluate the practicability and effectiveness of CP practices in \nthe country, and to strengthen a government agency\u2019s capacity to promote and transfer CP. The \nTA will focus on these activities to supplement other environmental management initiatives.4 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The  TA\u2019s  primary  purpose  is  to  enhance  DOST\u2019s  capacity  to  promote  sustainable \ndevelopment in the Philippines, and to strengthen the competitiveness of its industry sector \nthrough the understanding and adoption of CP practices. The TA will (i) build the capacity of \nDOST staff, concerned government agencies, and industry to identify, evaluate, develop, and \npromote CP; and (ii) assist industries, especially SMEs, to adopt an environment management \nsystem and practices through training and demonstration programs. \n \n8.  The  TA\u2019s  outputs  include  (i)  developing  guidelines  and  tools  for  local  industries  to \nfacilitate their adoption of CP practices; (ii) establishing support mechanisms primarily for the \nindustry sector to identify, evaluate, select, and acquire cost-effective technologies for CP; (iii) \nproviding TA to SMEs including CP assessment, training, and demonstration programs; (iv) \n                                                 \n4   The TA will also support the Metro Manila Air Quality Management Program loan (ADB. 1998. Metro Manila Air \nQuality Improvement Sector Development Program. Manila), by improving industrial efficiency and thus reducing \nwaste production, including air emissions. The TA includes a CP study for the transport sector to examine \npossible approaches to reducing air pollution of transportation. ", "    3 \npreparing  a  business  plan  for  DOST  to  promote  CP  in  the  country;  (v)  designing  and \nimplementing training programs to improve the technical capacity of CP promotion for staff from \nthe government, industry, and banking sectors; (vi) developing technical manuals on cleaner \nproduction for specific industry sectors; and (vii) providing a study tour in one or two similar \ninstitute(s) in the region to learn the operation and management of a CP institute.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will develop CP strategies and technical guidelines appropriate to the country to \naccelerate the adoption of CP by industries, and conduct pilot tests and capacity building \ntraining for both government and industries to supplement the Government\u2019s current efforts to \npromote CP. Six key outputs are envisaged under the TA. Their methodology and key activities \nare described below: \n  \n10.  Environmental Performance Indicators (EPIs). EPIs provide information about an \norganization\u2019s environmental performance. EPIs are classified as management performance \nindicators and operational performance indicators. EPIs developed in other countries will be \nreviewed. EPIs appropriate for local SMEs will then be formulated and introduced to selected \ncompanies to track their productivity and waste management improvements. The EPIs must be \nin a form that SME operators can easily understand and relate to their in-plant practices. Twenty \nSMEs will be selected to pilot test the use of the EPIs. The pilot test results will be used to \nrevise and finalize the EPIs. \n \n11.  CP and Environmental Management Systems for SMEs. A number of environmental \nmanagement systems have been developed by different countries and organizations. These \nexisting models will be reviewed and modified to meet the needs of industries in the Philippines. \nCP-EMS guidelines will be developed to help SMEs choose a generic model that they can \nidentify with, and implement within their resources and available assistance from projects and \nprograms. Ten to twenty industries, including SMEs and the Industrial Technology Development \nInstitute (ITDI) of DOST, if feasible, will be selected to demonstrate the development of the EMS \nin their management system.  \n \n12.  Business Plan for Promotion of Cleaner Production. A 5-year business plan for ITDI \nwill be developed to ensure the sustainability of CP promotion and adoption in the country. The \nbusiness  plan  will  address  ITDI\u2019s  key  functions  and  operational  goals  in  terms  of  CP \ndevelopment and promotion, short- and midterm agenda, information dissemination, training \nneeds, and human resources and budget requirements. The operations of similar institutes in \nthe region will be reviewed and analyzed. A study tour to one or two similar institute(s) in the \nregion will be arranged as part of the capacity building activities. \n \n13.  Environmental Technology Verification Protocols. Although ITDI has initiated the \nprocess  of  establishing  environmental  technology  verification  protocols  to  identify \nenvironmentally sound technologies, the protocols have yet to be tested. The TA will review \nclean technologies for at least eight industry subsectors (such as metals and allied industrial \nentities,  coconut-based  manufacturing,  food  processing,  textiles,  livestock,  forest-based \nproducts), test the evaluation criteria and verification process of the protocol, make appropriate \nmodifications, and present it to industry and concerned government agencies for finalization. \n \n14.  Cleaner Production Technical Manuals. At least four CP technical manuals will be \nproduced for industry (e.g., furniture making, ceramic production) and services (e.g., transport, ", "4 \nmaterials handling, utilities) sectors. The manuals, including best environmental management \nhandbooks for sector-specific activities, will supplement the training programs of the TA.  \n \n15.  Capacity Building Training Programs. The TA will review the existing performance \nmanagement system of DOST, and identify its shortcomings for organization improvement. The \nTA  will  identify  training  needs  of  stakeholders  and  design  training  programs  to  train \napproximately 500 staff from DOST, government, industry, banking, and other sectors on CP \npolicies and strategies, environmental management systems and practices, clean technology \nverification, and conduct of a feasibility study on CP technology. The EMS and environmental \ntechnology  verification  protocols,  and  their  demonstration  results  will  be  used  as  training \nmaterials. The participants in the training programs will be requested to evaluate and discuss \nthe appropriateness of the system and the protocols. Identification of potential trainers in the \ncountry and a training-for-trainers program will also be included to ensure the sustainability of \nthe TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.12 million equivalent. ADB will provide \n$400,000 on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Special Fund. The governments of Spain \nand  Norway  will  also  provide  grants  for  $300,000  equivalent  and  $75,000  equivalent, \nrespectively, from the Channel Financing Agreement Facility, to be administered by ADB for \nactivities  within  the  TA  scope.  The  Government  of  the  Philippines  will  finance  $345,000 \nequivalent in kind for counterpart staff, office space and provisions, administrative support, \nservices, and logistics. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  DOST,  as  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA,  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  TA \nmanagement and implementation. A steering committee will be set up to review and advise on \nthe implementation and the results of the TA. The committee will be chaired by the secretary of \nDOST,  and  consist  of  representatives  from  the  departments  of  Environment  and  Natural \nResources,  Energy,  Trade  and  Industry,  and  Interior  and  Local  Government;  industry \nassociations; academe; and professional organizations. The director of ITDI of DOST will be the \nTA director, responsible for TA implementation. \n \n 18.  The TA will be carried out in 12 months from November 2002 to October 2003. An \ninternational consulting firm associated with domestic consultants will be engaged to undertake \nthe TA. Two to three individual consultants or resource persons will be engaged to prepare \ntechnical manuals and special studies for specific industry subsectors. The total consulting \nservices will include 20 person-months of international consulting, and 40 person-months of \ndomestic  consulting.  Expertise  required  includes  environmental  management,  industrial \necology, strategic environmental assessment, environmental policy and institutional analysis, \nenvironmental  economics,  environmental  engineering,  chemical  engineering,  information \ntechnology and public awareness, and business management. The international and domestic \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nSimplified technical proposals will be evaluated using the quality and cost based selection \nmethod for the consulting firm. The consultants will work closely with the TA director. The \noutline terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 4. Equipment required for the TA \nimplementation will be procured in accordance with the ADB Guidelines for Procurement, and \nretained by DOST upon TA completion. \n ", "    5 \n19.

Industrial Efficiency and Pollution Control (United Nations Development Programme \n[UNDP], World Bank, Department of Environment and Natural Resources [DENR], 1991). The \nstudy proposed institutional, management, economic, regulatory, and financial, and technical \nmeasures to establish the conditions to achieve a significant reduction in industrial wastes. \n \n2.  Industrial Environmental Management Project (United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID), DENR, 1991\u20131996). The project aimed to encourage sustainable growth \nin the industry sector, while reducing industrial pollution and improving human health and the \nenvironment.  It  conducted  pollution  management  appraisals  at  150  facilities  nationwide  to \nidentify pollution prevention opportunities. \n \n3.  Industrial Waste Exchange Program (USAID, Philippine Business and Environment, \n1994 to present). The project promotes resource recovery and recycling in industries. It uses the \nBusiness and Environment magazine as a tool to disseminate information and maintain a \ndatabase of industrial wastes. \n \n4.  US-ASEAN Environmental Project (Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 1995). \nThe project conducted waste reduction assessments of the industry sector (e.g., food, cement, \npulp  and  paper,  and  iron  and  steel).  In  1999,  a  United  Nations  Industrial  Development \nOrganization (UNIDO) study evaluated the results of US-Asia Environmental Partnership in pulp \nand  paper,  and  cement  plants  in  the  Philippines.  Among  the  study\u2019s  preliminary  general \nconclusions were (i) many firms are aware of cleaner production (CP) as a practical means to \nreduce costs, measuring how much they benefited from it, is difficult; (ii) most firms would not \nmake  substantial  capital  investments  in  CP,  except  with  new  plants;  (iii)  supportive  policy \nelements are needed in finance, environment, education, and science and technology; and (iv) \nintegrated national CP policy and planning is needed to accelerate adoption of CP.  \n \n5.  Green Productivity Program (Asian Productivity Organization, 1997 to present). The \nprogram aims to minimize all pollution sources to achieve continuous improvement and higher \nproductivity in the industry sector. It also tapped the Private Enterprise Accelerated Resource \nLinkages  of  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  to  develop  the  program\u2019s \ninstitutional capabilities. \n \n6.  Industrial Initiatives for Sustainable Environment (USAID, DENR, 1998\u20132002). The \nproject aims to (i) promote the widespread use of environmental management systems and \npollution prevention practices in industries in the Visayas and Mindanao; and (ii) establish policy \nincentives  to  adopt  them  to  enhance  stakeholder  awareness  of  CP,  and  strengthen  local \nconsulting capacity to support the adoption of pollution prevention. \n \n7.  Private Sector Participation in Managing the Environment (UNDP, Department of \nTrade and Industry-Board of Investments, 1998\u20132002). The project aims to enhance the (i) \nbusiness competitiveness in the global marketplace through environmental management, and \n(ii) private sector\u2019s voluntary participation in protecting the environment and reducing pollution of \nindustries.
