THE ENSUING PROJECT \n1.  The government of Georgia (the government) is investing substantial amounts in the \ninfrastructure needed to take advantage of its location, with emphasis on the country\u2019s backbone \nfor transit trade comprised of the East\u2013West and North\u2013South transport corridors. At the end of \nApril 2019, more than 45% of the East\u2013West Highway was completed: about 190 kilometers (km) \nupgraded and 140 km under construction or with a contractor about to be mobilized. Assistance \nis being provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Investment Bank, Japanese \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank.  \n \n2.  The proposed project will (i) construct approximately 12 km of two-lane highway between \nthe terminus of Batumi bypass and the border crossing point at Sarpi (the project road), plus \nreorganize the arrival area at the international border at Sarpi to improve traffic flow and road \nsafety, and (ii) prepare the scope and specifications for a public\u2013private partnership or concession \nagreement for a combined highway rest area and logistics facility at the northern terminus of the \nproject road. The project road will provide opportunities for tourism development in the Adjara \nBlack Sea region by reducing travel time along the Black Sea coast and reducing congestion/road \nsafety problems at the busiest border crossing point (Sarpi). \n \n3.  The project is aligned with the following impact:  improvement of regional connectivity in \nGeorgia so that it can play the role of regional transport and logistics hub.1 The project will have \nthe following outcome: efficiency of road transport along the East\u2013West Highway in Georgia \nimproved. It is consistent with the strategic objectives of ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy \n(2019-2023),2  and is included in the Country Operations Business Plan for Georgia, 2019\u20132021. \n \n4.  The project is expected to cost about $300 million. The government has approached the  \nADB and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to help finance the project. The government \nwill provide counterpart funding of about $50 million equivalent to cover taxes and duties, land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  financing  charges,  and  other  miscellaneous  costs.  The \nMinistry of Regional Development and Infrastructure will be the executing agency and its Roads \nDepartment will be the implementing agency. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n5.  The  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance  (TRTA)  will  help  the  government  of \nGeorgia (the government) prepare the proposed ensuing project.3 The TRTA will ensure that the \nproject  will  be  prepared  to  acceptable  technical,  safeguards,  and  procurement  standards. \nThe ensuing project is expected to meet the \u201chigh readiness\u201d criteria before Board consideration. \nThe government has prepared, with ADB assistance, a full feasibility study and design for the \nproject.4 \n \n                                                \n1  Government of Georgia, Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure.

The  proposed  project  is  very  challenging  from  an  engineering  and \nconstruction perspective. It will include a long tunnel (about 5 km long) and several bridges or \nviaducts. Preparation of the rest area/logistics facility is also additional since the feasibility and \ndesign consultants commenced. Several technical areas will require finalization once the design \nconsultants have concluded their assignment. Given the project\u2019s complexity and safeguards \nimpacts, resources will be required to (i) improve and finalize the safeguard documents that are \nbeing prepared by the feasibility and design consultants, (ii) assist with strategic procurement \nplanning/ensuring procurement of the project\u2019s civil works and consulting services are carried out \nefficiently and effectively, (iii) prepare a climate risk assessment and management report, and (iv) \nassess possible private sector options for the highway rest area/logistics facility. In addition, the \nproposed TRTA will help enhance communication and engagement with project beneficiaries and \naffected people through tailored communication activities and media. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n7.  Output 1: Due diligence on the proposed project carried out. This output will include \nfinalizing safeguards documentation for the environmental and social aspects of the project \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement 2009 and preparing a gender action plan, if \ngender entry points can be identified, following ADB\u2019s guidelines for such plans. It will also include \nthe preparation and implementation of a project communication strategy and action plan, social \nand poverty reduction strategy, climate change assessment and technical/financial due diligence. \n \n8.  Output 2: Procurement support provided. This output will include strategic procurement \nplanning, assisting the government with advertising the contracts, preparing and managing pre-\nbid meetings and site visits, receiving bids, evaluating bids, preparing bid evaluation reports for \ngovernment and ADB approval, and finalizing contract documentation for award. \n \n9.  Output  3:  Assessment  of  options  and  preparation  of  scope  for  highway  rest \narea/logistics facility. This output will include (i) the preparation of a  document including \nspecifications for a potential facility, including minimums for provision of various services including \nparking, storage, restaurants and sanitation facilities; and (ii) scoping study for modalities for a \npublic\u2013private partnership to build and operate such a facility.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $425,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other resources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \nfurnished  office  accommodation  in  the  Roads  Department\u2019s  premises  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The government was informed that approval of the TRTA does not commit ADB to \nfinance the ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  ADB will administer the TRTA. The Transport and Communications Division of Central \nand West Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate the consultants. \n \n12.
