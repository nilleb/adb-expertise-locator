INTRODUCTION \n1.  Achieving development goals is particularly challenging when a state is functionally and \ninstitutionally  weak,  is  unable  to  effectively  extend  its  authority,  and  political  legitimacy  is \nchallenged by conflicting interests and values\u2014that is a fragile and conflict-affected situation \n(FCAS).1 Based on a harmonized approach by multilateral development banks to classifying \ncountries with FCAS, ADB identified for its 2014 operations nine countries with annual country \nperformance  assessment  results  below  the  FCAS  cutoff  namely,  Afghanistan,  Kiribati,  the \nMarshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Nepal, Solomon Islands, Timor-\nLeste, and Tuvalu. It is also recognized that other DMCs experience some characteristics of \nFCAS or subnational situations of fragility and conflict.  \n \n2.  The ADB has a long-standing commitment to supporting development effectiveness in \nfragile and conflict-affected situations. ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 20202 highlights the \nimportance of understanding the local context, making long-term commitments, and ensuring \ncountry ownership in FCAS, in addition to being flexible in responding effectively to the unique \nchallenges  in  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  with  FCAS.  In  addition,  the  Pacific \nApproach, 2010\u201320143 further supports the implementation of ADB\u2019s approach to engaging with \nFCAS (footnote 1), in line with the implementation of the 2010 recommendations of the special \nevaluation study on FCAS4 and ADB\u2019s operational plan in FCAS.5 \n \n3.  This technical assistance (TA) builds on previous assistance to ADB\u2019s engagement in \nFCAS,6 to support fragility and conflict-sensitive approaches to development in fragile states in \nAsia  and  the  Pacific.7 Resilience  mapping  provides  the  means  to  capture  collective  local \nknowledge to allow all stakeholders in development to better understand the operating context \nand provide for context-relevant, hence resilient, interventions. This TA will support and expand \nthe  application  of  specific  assessment  tools  (e.g.,  peacebuilding  tool,  guide  to  fragility \nassessment,  fragility  index,  institutional  strengthening  framework,  and  customized  risk \nmanagement framework)8 piloted in DMCs with FCAS.9 This will enable governments to lead \nand build more effective policies and programs designed specifically to manage the complex \ndevelopment issues in each FCAS. A key lesson from earlier TA projects is that to avoid \nnegative  effects  and  maximize  positive  impacts  for  peacebuilding  and/or  statebuilding  and \ndevelopment, further strengthening of government and development partners\u2019 practical tools for \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2007.

Thus, this TA will also \nsupport the g7+10 efforts to implement the New Deal.11 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Need to translate international commitments into actions for fragile states. Since \n2005, many high-level meetings have been held and declarations of intent have been issued on \naid effectiveness in FCAS, but those commitments need to be translated into more effective \naction on the ground.12 In June 2013, ADB and the Government of Australia held a high-level \nforum  in  Manila  on  Building  Resilience  to  Fragility  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  to  translate \ninternational intent into country-led actions that would allow more resilient and more inclusive \nsocieties to emerge. The Manila forum was designed to exchange ideas on new ways of \nengagement and what constitutes \u201cworking differently\u201d13 and working better in FCAS to help \nbuild  resilience  to  fragility  and  conflict.  The  Manila  forum  made  five  recommendations: \n(i) increase the participation of all FCAS stakeholders, (ii) give greater voice to countries with \nFCAS,  (iii)  improve  FCAS  funding,  (iv)  map  fragility  to  better  understand  and  work  more \nefficiently in the local context (resilience mapping), and (v) measure fragility.14 This TA will focus \non resilience mapping through participatory approaches in selected countries with FCAS.   \n \n5.  Lack of understanding of the local context in which development partners operate. \nWithout proper understanding and appreciation of the local conditions, the policies, principles, \nand approaches that governments and development partners normally apply can be ineffective. \nEngagement without understanding the local context may even result in risks that could add to \nthe  difficulties  that  states  already  face  in  establishing  effective  and  legitimate  institutions, \npolicies, and the leadership needed to transit to stability and sustained development over the \nlong term. \u201cInternational action should focus on facilitating local processes, leveraging local \ncapacities  and  complementing  local  actions,  so  that  local  citizens  can  create  governance \nsystems appropriate to their surroundings.\u201d15 Furthermore, \u201cforeign blueprints for establishing \nstate institutions may not be suitable to local conditions.\u201d16 Mapping fragility by using tools (such \n                                                \n10 g7+ is the world\u2019s first collective voice of 20 countries that are or have been affected by conflict and are now in \ntransition to the next stage of development. The main objective of the g7+ is to share experiences and learn from \none another, and to advocate for reforms to the way the international community engages in conflict-affected \nstates.  Afghanistan,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Solomon  Islands,  and  Timor-Leste  are  members  of  the  g7+. \nhttp://www.g7plus.org/ \n11 The New Deal is a key agreement between fragile states and partners to change the policy and practice of \nengagement to work together promoting peacebuilding and statebuilding in countries affected by conflict and \nfragility. This includes providing more timely, transparent, and predictable assistance; promoting the use of country \nsystems; adopting joint donor risk-mitigation strategies; and aiming at more effective capacity development. \n  International  Dialogue  on  Peacebuilding  and  Statebuilding.  A  New  Deal  for  Engagement  in  Fragile  States. \nwww.newdeal4peace.org/ \n12 The international agenda on fragility and conflict has progressed from the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in \n2005  to  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  Principles  for  Good  International \nEngagement in Fragile States and Situations (2007), the Accra Agenda for Action (2008), the Dili Declaration \n(2010), further g7+ Statements (2011), the Busan New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States (2011), the Dili \nConsensus  (2013),  and  the Washington  Communiqu\u00e9  (2013).  However,  this  agenda  is  not  complete.  The \nWashington Communiqu\u00e9 stresses \u201cthe value of a post-2015 development agenda that recognizes the universal \nimportance of peacebuilding and statebuilding and that reflects the results and lessons of the New Deal.\u201d The 2011 \nWorld Development Report also addresses the needs of conflict, security, and development. \n13 ADB.  2012.

The mapping may also help identify \npeacebuilding indicators to measure fragility, in quantitative or qualitative terms. \n \n6.  Supplementing Asia-Pacific specialist capacity to support development in fragile \nand conflict-affected situations. To more effectively meet the very specific needs of FCAS \ncountries, a dedicated team of FCAS experts (a resource group) will be engaged under this TA \n(FCAS resource group) to provide country and project specific support in ADB's geographically \ndiverse FCAS and in subnational situations of fragility and conflict.17 The learning from this TA \nwill  provide  a  secondary  benefit  through  better  informing  the  content  of  government  and \ndevelopment practitioner training on FCAS.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be greater resilience to fragility and conflict in FCAS in Asia and the \nPacific. The outcome will be that resilience mapping better informs strategies, programs, and \nprojects in selected countries with FCAS. The resilience mapping will identify drivers of fragility \nand conflict in selected DMCs with FCAS, peacebuilding and statebuilding opportunities, and \npolicies and programs designed specifically to manage the complex development issues in \nFCAS. The one-solution-fits-all method does not apply in FCAS, and the resilience mapping will \ninform  customized,  and  fragility-  and  conflict-sensitive,  approaches  to  development,  to  be \nintegrated  within  complex  institutional  cultures,  structures,  and  systems,  and  to  be \noperationalized in difficult and volatile political contexts (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The proposed TA will (i) conduct fragility- and conflict-sensitive assessments in selected \nFCAS; (ii) strengthen institutional capacity for fragility- and conflict-sensitive approaches to \ndevelopment; and (iii) implement a communication strategy to promote and advocate wider use \nof  resilience  mapping  and  fragility-  and  conflict-sensitive  approaches  in  selected  FCAS. \nActivities in support of the outputs will be further defined in an annual TA work plan to be \ndeveloped during TA implementation (Appendix 1, Activities with Milestones). \n \n9.  The TA will deliver the following interlinked outputs: \n \n10.  Output  1:  Fragility  and  conflict-sensitive  assessments  conducted  in  selected \nFCAS using existing tools and frameworks. The fragility- and conflict-sensitive assessments \nwill use, further refine, and customize, as deemed appropriate, the existing specific assessment \ntools, some of which have been previously piloted in selected FCAS, such as the peacebuilding \ntool developed in Nepal, or the practical guide to fragility assessment, which was conceived to \ninform country strategic formulation and used to prepare the forthcoming country partnership \nstrategy for Papua New Guinea. Assessments will also link the wealth of information available in \n                                                \n17  The Operational Plan for Enhancing ADB\u2019s Effectiveness in FCAS commits ADB to 13 activities during 2013\u20132020. \nOne of these activities is the establishment of a resource group, composed of consultants with FCAS experience \n(footnote 5). \n ", "4   \nthe country performance assessments (or post-conflict country performance assessments) and \nthe  Asian  Development  Outlook  to  better  comprehend  local  fragility  dynamics  and  the \ninteractions with societies, institutional cultures, structures, and systems in such risky operating \ncontexts. The resilience mapping will (i) capture the drivers of fragility and conflict in a particular \ncountry with FCAS; (ii) identify ways to cultivate the country\u2019s strategies, programs, and projects \nto  nurture  peacebuilding  and  statebuilding  efforts  to  build  resilience;  and  (iii)  integrate  all \nexisting assessments that can be used by FCAS governments and development partners in \ncountry programming and project financing into a customized (country-specific) framework for \npeacebuilding and statebuilding. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  on  fragility-  and \nconflict-sensitive  approaches  to  development  conducted  for  partner  government \nagencies and development practitioners in selected FCAS. The output will foster the use of \nfragility- and conflict-sensitive approaches to development. It will be designed for government \nofficials and development practitioners to gain a deeper understanding of (i) fragility and conflict \nfrom a broader perspective, (ii) issues and challenges likely encountered when engaging in \nFCAS, (iii) reasons for working differently in FCAS, and (iv) practical approaches to providing \neffective  development  support  given  the  issues  and  challenges  encountered.18 It  will  help \npartner  government  agencies  and  development  practitioners  maximize  the  findings  of  the \nresilience-mapping exercise and to explore ways to integrate and operationalize fragility and \nconflict sensitivity continuously, from strategic formulation and project preparation to completion. \n \n12.  Output  3:  National  communication  strategies  implemented  to  promote  and \nadvocate the use of resilience mapping and fragility- and conflict-sensitive approaches \namong key international and local players in selected FCAS. The communication strategy \nwill be customized for country use, where relevant, and implemented to promote a wider use of \nresilience mapping for designing and implementing a fragility- and conflict-sensitivity approach \nto development. It will also advocate regular and balanced oversight to inform risk management \nand project adaptation. The communication strategy will be designed to inform and engage \nstakeholders, as well as enlist and sustain public support to nurture \u201cownership.\u201d \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  Participating  DMC  governments  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  This TA will be executed and implemented by ADB. The FCAS focal point\u2014hosted by \nADB\u2019s Pacific Department and working under the guidance of the FCAS steering committee, \nchaired by the director general of ADB\u2019s Strategy and Policy Department\u2014will exercise overall \ncoordination and supervision. All DMCs with FCAS identified by ADB, including DMCs exhibiting \ntransitional and subnational situations of fragility, will be eligible to participate in the TA. TA \nactivities will commence only after no-objection confirmation is obtained from each participating \ncountry. \n \n                                                \n18  Many such approaches are collected in ADB\u2019s FCAS handbook (footnote 13).  \n ", "  5 \n15.  Due to the complexities and risks inherent in the operating environments found in FCAS, \nthe TA will be implemented over a 40-month period, from 1 January 2015 to 30 April 2018. \n \n16.  The TA will require an estimated 95 person-months of consulting services (24 person-\nmonths  of  international,  31  person-months  of  national,  and  40  person-months  of  national \ncountry specialists). ADB will recruit all consultants as individuals through individual consulting \nservices in line with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). 19 Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). A TA coordinator and team \nleader\u2014an economist with FCAS expertise (international consultant, intermittent, 24 person-\nmonths)  and  based  at  ADB  headquarters\u2014will  assist  the  FCAS  focal  point,  and  regional \ndepartments and resident missions in ADB DMCs with FCAS, in formulating and applying all \nmapping exercises, as well as help conduct training on fragility and conflict sensitivity, and \nimplement communication strategies. The consultant will oversee the knowledge management \nand capacity-building aspects of the TA and will provide overall coordination of inputs into the \nTA.  A  FCAS  knowledge  management  and  communication  specialist  (national  consultant, \nintermittent, 31 person-months), based at ADB headquarters, will assist the focal point and \nsupport the TA coordinator. Up to six country specialists (local consultants, intermittent, up to a \ncombined total of 40 person-months) will assist and support the implementation of the TA \nactivities,  including  the  mapping  and  capacity  building  initiatives,  and  the  communication \nstrategy in each participating country. The resource group will assist the focal point in submitting \nTA progress reports and other reports to the steering committee. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis for \nMapping Resilience to Fragility and Conflict in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n                                                \n19 To reduce the administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money, all consulting services \nunder the TA will be engaged on output-based (lump-sum) contracts. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nGreater resilience to  Countries with FCAS  Annual CPA exercise  Governments of DMCs \nfragility and conflict in  annual CPAs improved on    with FCAS adopt and \nFCAS in Asia and the  average by 1 point or 1.5  Country strategic  support policies, \nPacific  points by end 2020  formulation and project  programs, and projects \ndocuments  that enhance resilience. \n \nDevelopment partners \napply the findings of \nFCAS resilience \nmapping, and use a \nfragility- and conflict-\nsensitive approach to \ndevelopment. \n \nRisk \nExternal economic \nshocks and/or natural \ndisasters exacerbate \nthe fragile situations. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nResilience mapping  Percentage of CPSs,  DMCs with FCAS  CPSs  DMCs with FCAS \nbetter informs  sector strategies, and  and sector strategies  political risks arising \nstrategies, programs,  financing of programs and    from strategies and \nand projects in  projects in FCAS with  Knowledge products  programs overcome by \nselected countries  fragility- and conflict- effective participatory \nwith FCAS  sensitive approaches  processes \nincreases to 80% by end   \nof 2018.
