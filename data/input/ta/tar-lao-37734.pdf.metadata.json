In November 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided phase I of a technical \nassistance (TA)1 to the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) to \nundertake preparatory work for the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Development Project (NT2 \nProject).  The  TA  was  to  assist  the  Government  of  Lao  PDR\u2019s  efforts  to  (i)  prepare  the \ncumulative impact assessment (CIA) study; (ii) assess its capacity to implement the hydropower \ndevelopment projects effectively, particularly the social and environmental mitigation measures, \nand develop an appropriate capacity-building program; (iii) communicate effectively with the \nproject-affected  people;  (iv) identify  compensatory  forestry  component  for  NT2  Project \nsubmergence  area;  and  (v) facilitate  coordination  with  the  civil  society,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders. \n \n2.  The activities under the proposed NT2 Project were delayed due to the possible change \nin the composition of the developer, the Nam Theun 2 Power Company (NTPC)2 resulting from \nthe withdrawal of Electricit\u00e9 de France International (EdFI) from the Project on 17 July 2003. \nWith the return of the EdFI as the lead project sponsor on the same terms and conditions as \npreviously agreed, and signing of the power purchase agreements between NTPC and the \nElectricity Generating Authority of Thailand, and between NTPC and Electricit\u00e9 du Lao in \nNovember 2003, the processing of the proposed NT2 Project is back on track. The Government \nof Lao PDR and NTPC have requested ADB and the World Bank to complete the due diligence \nprocess as soon as possible. \n \n3.  In response to the request of the Government of Lao PDR, an ADB Mission visited the \nLao PDR in January 2004 to reconfirm the understanding with the Government of Lao PDR on \nthe objectives, scope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangement for the second phase \n(Phase II) TA,3 which was agreed during the Fact-Finding Mission conducted in July 2003 prior \nto splitting of the TA. The Mission also held an aid coordination meeting with key aid agencies \nactive in the Lao PDR to exchange information and views on each other\u2019s initiatives. While \nsome aspects of the Phase I TA, namely the capacity-building program and the CIA study, need \nto be incorporated into the phase II TA, most activities proposed under phase II such as the \neconomic and financial analysis and  social assessment are independent of the phase I TA. \nTherefore, the Government of Lao PDR requested ADB to proceed with the phase II TA as soon \nas possible to facilitate the completion of the due diligence. The Government of Lao PDR was \nadvised that, notwithstanding the timeframe for the completion of the phases I and II TAs, \nprocessing of the proposed NT2 Project will be initiated only after the satisfactory completion of \nthe due diligence process.4 The NT2 Project is included in the country strategy and program for \nthe Lao PDR in 2004.5 The initial poverty and social assessment is shown in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The  Government  of  Lao  PDR  plans  to  accelerate  hydropower  development  and \nsubstantially increase power exports to achieve three main goals: (i) promotion of economic \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n2  The consortium comprises the Electricit\u00e9 de France International (EdFI), Electricity Generating Public Company of \nThailand (EGAT), Electricit\u00e9 du Lao (EDL), and Ital-Thai Development Company (ITD). \n3  The Phase II TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 2003. \n4  The Government of Lao PDR has requested the ADB public sector loan for the payment of a portion of its equity \ncontribution in NTPC, where as the NTPC has requested a private sector loan and a political risk guarantee. \n5  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004-2006): Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Manila. ", "2 \ndevelopment, (ii) increased foreign exchange earnings, and (iii) an increased fiscal revenue \nbase for meeting development objectives and poverty reduction. The Lao PDR has a technically \nexploitable  hydropower  potential  of  about  18,000  megawatts  (MW),  of  which  623  MW  of \ngeneration capacity has been developed through seven hydropower plants.  \n \n5.  There are about 33 potential sites for hydropower development in the Lao PDR, of which \n11 major hydropower projects, with a total design capacity of 4,000 MW, are in the planning or \nadvanced planning stage for implementation during the next 10 years. Eight of the 11 projects \nare expected to be built on an IPP/build-operate-transfer basis. The total capital cost of the \ncurrently proposed IPP projects for the period to 2010 is about $5 billion in current prices. \nHowever, it is unlikely that all projects will be implemented in the period originally planned. A \nmajor  challenge  in  realizing  the  hydropower  development  goals  is  the  domestic  resource \nconstraints to finance the development expenditure. The Government of Lao PDR recognizes \nthat it will need to attract increased private investment to help bridge the domestic investment-\nsavings gap in financing its ambitious hydropower development agenda. Socially appropriate \nand environmentally sustainable investments in hydropower generation capacity to facilitate the \nhydropower exports are required to increase market opportunities and boost fiscal revenue.  \n \n6.  A private sector consortium, NTPC, is in the process of completing the studies on the \nNT2 Project to generate about 1,100 MW of electric power, mainly for export to Thailand. Power \nexport to Thailand will lower energy cost in that country and enhance energy security through \nfuel diversity. The revenue generated from NT2 Project will help the Government of Lao PDR \nimplement measures for poverty reduction and design programs to improve the quality of life of \nthe people. However, insufficient capacity to effectively implement socially and environmentally \nsustainable hydropower development projects in the Lao PDR is a major concern, particularly \nfor large-scale and complex projects, such as the NT2 Project. Effective implementation is \nessential to realizing the potential benefits of the NT2 Project. To help the country address \nthese issues, there is a need for longer-term capacity building efforts, which have been initiated \nunder the phase I TA. \n \n7.  A  set  of  policy  and  institutional  reforms  covering  the  macroeconomic  stabilization \nprogram, governance, and human capital development have been outlined and discussed by \nADB,  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  and  the  World  Bank.  The  IMF-backed Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility, the World Bank\u2019s Financial Management Adjustment Credit and \nADB\u2019s Banking Sector Reform Program seek to strengthen the Government of Lao PDR\u2019s \ncapabilities though economic, financial, and public sector reforms. The policy reforms under \nthese interventions have strong links and impacts on all sectors of the Lao economy and are \nderiving the current reform agenda, particularly the development of macroeconomic framework \nand sector development strategies and plans for the country. Also, the government-driven \nPoverty Reduction Policy and Strategy lays out the strategy for sustainable and environmentally \nresponsible use of revenues derived from natural resources such as hydropower, forestry, and \nmining. Demonstrated progress on the implementation of these reforms will be guided and \nmeasured by a set of performance benchmarks and will be prerequisite for ADB and World \nBank support for the NT2 Project.  \n \n8.  The World Bank6 has been involved in assessing the financial and economic impact of \nthe NT2 Project. The World Bank\u2019s work related to the NT2 Project that has been completed or \nis in progress include (i) analysis of financial revenue flow, (ii) review and update of the power \n                                                 \n6  Other external funding agencies such as the Agence Francaise de Developpement and European Investment Bank \nmay also provide some financial support for the project.

The World Bank will also undertake the demand \nforecast analysis for the areas feasible for electrification in  the Lao PDR in the short and \nmedium term run as a result of the NT2 Project. ADB will review the key aspects of the \neconomic and financial analysis undertaken by the World Bank and assess the information gaps \nin their work, such as the distribution analysis, to ensure that ADB\u2019s requirements are met. \nFurther data collection and analysis will be required for the Lao PDR, particularly with respect to \ndemand and investment requirements in distribution and transmission, for assessing domestic \nabsorptive capacity for supply of electricity from the NT2 Project. Additional data and analysis \nwill also be required to assess the distribution of benefits between Thailand, the Government of \nLao PDR, Electricit\u00e9 du Lao, private investors, and Lao consumers. ADB and the World Bank \nwill also jointly provide funds to the Government of Lao PDR, with appropriate financial and \nrevenue management controls to ensure the availability of funds for implementation of its \nNational Poverty Eradication Program. The phase II TA will review appropriate financial and \nrevenue management controls for the agency nominated to hold the Government of Lao PDR\u2019s \nshare in the NT2 Project and receive project dividends. The updated list of work undertaken or \nbeing undertaken by ADB, the developer, and World Bank is presented in Appendix 2.  \n \n9.  The main social impacts are relocation of 5,600 people on the Nakai Plateau and the \nreservoir area, potential for trafficking of women and children and spread of diseases during \nconstruction, uncertain impacts of increased flows and water levels downstream from the dam, \nand restrictions on access to resources by 5,000 ethnic minority people in the watershed and \nnational biodiversity conservation area. These issues are being addressed by the Project \ndeveloper to meet ADB and the World Bank\u2019s social safeguard requirements. Other potential \nadverse  environmental  and  social  impacts  requiring  mitigation  or  compensation  measures \ninclude (i) ecological losses in the Nam Theun, downstream areas of the dam, and the Xe Bang \nFai; and (ii) fisheries impact affecting the livelihood of the people in the downstream areas of the \ndam and the Xe Bang Fai. These issues are also being addressed by the project developers in \ndetail and the recommended mitigation measures will be incorporated in the final project design. \nIn addition, the CIA study will look into a range of issues along the Nam Kading, Nam Theun, \nand Xe Bang Fai river basins with respect to the vulnerability due to flooding, hydrology, \nfisheries, water quality. Water assessment for the Project will be undertaken with respect to \nsupply and irrigation, urban development, institutions, and biodiversity. The TA will also examine \nthe potential impacts beyond the project boundary in the Mekong River basin. \n \n10.  The  assessment  of  the  mitigation  measures  for  potential  environmental  and  social \nimpacts of the NT2 Project has been extensively studied by the World Bank since early 1990s. \nADB has been involved in the NT2 Project since November 2002 to complement the due \ndiligence work being undertaken by the World Bank. The joint ADB-World Bank due diligence \nwork is to ensure that the safeguard policies of the two institutions are complied with and the \nsector  issues  are  addressed  appropriately.  It  has  been  agreed  that  funding  agencies  will \ncoordinate, and not duplicate work, unless there are compelling institutional requirements for \nseparate analysis and/or documentation. \n \n11.  The  work  under  the  phase  I  TA  is  in  progress  and  the  relevant  results  will  be \nincorporated in the phase II TA. The outcome of the phase II TA will help ensure for the \nGovernment of Lao PDR the technical, economic, and financial viability of the NT2 Project, and \nthat the design and implementation of safeguard policies covering the hydropower development ", "4 \nare of a standard acceptable to the multilateral financial institutions and other lenders. It will also \nhelp the Government of Lao PDR obtain broad support from international funding agencies and \ncivil society for the Lao PDR\u2019s development strategy, and more specifically, the development of \nthe NT2 Project. The findings of the TA will be used in discussion with stakeholders, especially \nthe affected people in the project area and the downstream river basin, and with the national, \nregional, and international civil society. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Proposed Output \n \n12.  The objectives of the phase II TA are to (i) confirm specific aspects of the technical, \neconomic, and financial viability of the proposed Project not covered under  the World Bank \nwork; (ii) ensure that social and environmental impacts have been properly identified; (iii) ensure \nthat the mitigation measures are developed in a consultative manner in accordance with the \ngood practices and relevant ADB policies and guidelines; and (iv) enable the Government of \nLao PDR to manage complex hydropower development projects in an environmentally and \nsocially sustainable manner in the future. The scope of the TA will include (i) incorporation of \nrelevant  results  of  the  phase  I  TA  findings  into  the  project  safeguard  documents, \n(ii) implementation  of  the  short-  and  medium-term  capacity  building  program  for  effective \nmitigation of social and environmental impacts developed under the phase I TA, (iii) additional \neconomic and financial analysis of the Project to include risks and distributional effects and \nintegrating the results of the social and environmental cost-benefit analysis, (iv) poverty analysis \nfocusing  on  the  macroeconomic  impacts  of  the  NT2  Project,  (v) facilitation  of  effective \nconsultation with various stakeholders, (vi) continued coordination with local and international \nnongovernment organizations, and other civil society stakeholders, and (vii) preparation of the \nsafeguards documents in accordance with ADB requirements. The outline terms of reference of \nthe consultants is given in Appendix 3. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The phase II TA will assess the macroeconomic impact of the NT2 Project and examine \npossible  effects  on  sectoral  allocations  and  other  funds  particularly  essential  for  poverty \nreduction in the Lao PDR. To ensure that the ADB requirements are met, the phase II TA will \nalso undertake the project economic and financial analysis to supplement the work being done \nby the World Bank. This work will include (i) reconfirmation of work conducted by the World \nBank consultant, and (ii) distribution analysis focusing on net benefits between Lao PDR and \nThailand and on the benefit stream for the Lao PDR. The phase II TA will facilitate the local, \nnational, regional, and international consultation process, including participation of ADB staff as \nresource speakers and facilitators. It will also facilitate effective dissemination of information \nabout the NT2 Project to various stakeholders using various modes of communication. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the phase II TA is estimated at $1.18 million equivalent, comprising a \nforeign exchange cost of $940,000 and a local currency cost of $240,000 equivalent. ADB will \nprovide $1.00 million to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $60,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The Government of Lao PDR will finance $180,000 equivalent in kind by providing \noffice accommodation, counterpart staff, and related facilities. The details of the cost estimates ", "    5 \nare outlined in Appendix 4. The Government of Lao PDR has been informed that provision of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The  TA  will  finance  international  and  domestic  consulting  services,  which  will  be \nprovided by a consulting firm and a team of individual consultants. The firm will implement the \ncapacity-building program for mitigation of the social and environmental impacts. The consulting \nfirm for the capacity-building program will be selected through simplified technical proposals. \nIndividual consultants will be engaged for specific tasks, including economic analysis, financial \nanalysis,  macroeconomic  analysis  and  poverty  assessment,  communication,  environment, \nethnic minorities development, social development, and project management and coordination. \nFinancial and economic analysis work will also involve confirmation and enhancement of the \nwork  undertaken  by  the  project  sponsor  and  the  other  development  partners.  The  total \ninternational consultants input is estimated at 35 person-months and the domestic consultants \nat  about  20  person-months.  ADB  will  recruit  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Materials and supplies will be procured by the consultants. \n \n16.  The Ministry of Industry and Handicraft (MIH) of the Government of Lao PDR will \ncontinue to be the Executing Agency of the phase II TA. MIH will also act as the national \ncoordinator and interact with the consultants and the ADB team. MIH has established a task \nforce  that  includes  representatives  from  key  economic,  energy,  social,  and  environmental \npolicy-making government agencies. The task force is chaired by a senior MIH official whose \nresponsibility is to facilitate TA activities, provide inputs, and review the outputs. The consultants \nfor the phase II TA will review the relevant documents prepared by the phase I TA consultants, \nthe  World  Bank,  project  developer,  and  other  financial  institutions,  and  coordinate  their \nactivities. In view of the diverse field of activities to be undertaken simultaneously by a large \nnumber of consultants who will be required to interact with numerous government agencies, \nADB staff, phase I TA consultants, and experts from other agencies undertaking numerous \nstudies, a consultants project manager must be engaged to coordinate all activities during the \ncritical stage of project preparation.  \n \n17.  The phase II TA will be implemented over an 18-month period commencing in April 2004 \nand  ending  in  September  2005.  An  inception  report  to  be  submitted  after  1  month  of \ncommencement will include an overall phase II TA work plan that will be discussed at ADB in \nManila and in the Lao PDR. An interim report summarizing the phase  II TA activities up to \nDecember 2004 will be submitted at the end of January 2005. The draft final report will be \nsubmitted in May 2005 and the final report incorporating comments on the draft report will be \nsubmitted in September 2005.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for preparing the Greater Mekong \nSubregion: Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Development Project Phase II, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT \n \nA.

Hydropower is a major industry in terms  develop potential. The Lao PDR has technically exploitable \nof contribution to total economic output, fiscal  hydropower potential estimated at 18,000 megawatts (MW), \nrevenue, and export earnings.   but only 623 MW have been harnessed. The project will help \n  significantly fulfill this potential.  \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao PDR: \n \nSustainable economic growth is critical to reduce poverty in the Lao PDR. Over the last 10 years, poverty has \ndeclined from 45% in 1993 to about 30% in 2003. This remarkable achievement is due mainly to stable economic \ngrowth of about 5.5% per annum. The Government of Lao PDR has an ambitious target of graduating from a least \ndeveloped country by 2020.  \n \nTo achieve this, the Government of Lao PDR aims to accelerate hydropower development and substantially increase \npower exports to achieve two main goals: (i) promote economic and social development by providing an affordable, \nreliable, and sustainable electricity supply; and (ii) build an additional revenue base to meet development objectives \nand reduce poverty. The country\u2019s rich hydropower resources are an important source of foreign exchange earnings \nand budget revenue, amounting to about $45 million since 2000.  \n \nWhile the project\u2019s financial revenue stream has significant potential to enhance the fiscal revenue base, the effective \nimpact on economic growth and poverty reduction will depend on proper management and adequate allocation of \nfunds for poverty reduction-related initiatives.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Poverty Classification:  \nThematic Classification: Economic growth    Beneficiary nonspecific intervention \n \nThe poverty analysis will need to examine the key channels (direct, indirect, and macroeconomic) through which the \nproject will reduce poverty. \n \nDirect Effects on Poverty \nThe project is expected to generate significant revenues over a considerable period to the Government of Lao PDR in \nthe form of dividends, taxes, and royalties. The poverty analysis must consider how these revenues should be \nexpended to maximize their impact on reducing poverty.  The analysis should consider what mechanisms are needed \nto ensure that expected revenues are channeled into poverty reduction initiatives.  The World Bank and ADB have \nproposed a two track approach: Track one is to build on ongoing reform programs to strengthen the Government of \nLao PDR\u2019s financial management systems.  Track two is to put in place the essential safeguards to ensure that NT2 \nrevenues specifically are used transparently in financing the Government of Lao PDR\u2019s priority poverty reduction \nprograms. \n \nIndirect Effects on Poverty \nOf the hydropower generated from this project, 5% will be consumed in the Lao PDR, and could provide electricity to \nsome of the more remote and poor regions, where it will significantly improve living conditions of the poor. The \nanalysis should examine which regions will benefit from access to the power generated, and distributional aspects \nassociated with it. \n \nMacroeconomic Effects on Poverty \nGiven the large size of the project in relation to the Lao PDR\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), economic growth is \nexpected to be boosted significantly. Improved and sustainable economic growth will help reduce poverty. The \nanalysis should assess the project\u2019s potential economic growth effects, as well as how economic growth has recently \naffected poverty. The analysis should also examine the impacts on the fiscal situation and service delivery. If \nmanaged appropriately, project revenues could help improve budgetary stability and curtail inflation, enhancing ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nmanaged appropriately, project revenues could help improve budgetary stability and curtail inflation, enhancing \nmacroeconomic performance and economic growth. Project revenues will also help improve service delivery and thus \nreduce poverty.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis:  \n \nStakeholder analysis has been an integral part of project preparation. Four target groups have been identified for \nconsultation: (i) project-affected people; (ii) district, provincial, and national government officials; (iii) civil society and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs); and (iv) international NGOs, international organizations, and other interest \ngroups. These target groups have been subdivided into the following operating areas:  \n \n(i)  local: households and villagers in the Nam Theun Watershed; Nakai Plateau; and downstream \ncommunities in the project area (downstream channel, Xe Bang Fai River, Nam Kathang, Nam Phit, \nNam Kading, Nam Theun, the transmission line corridor, etc.); \n(ii)  regional: community leaders, district agencies, provincial agencies, and business/contractors; \n(iii)  national: government ministries, citizens, and media; and \n(iv)  international: international NGOs, international media, aid community, financial institutions, international \npower utilities, and other hydropower dam developers. \n  \nParticipation strategy required: Yes\u2014for all aspects of the project preparation, including the social development plan \nfor the plateau and downstream communities, and the social and environmental management framework and \noperational plan for the watershed. \n \nD.
