I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nguarantee facility for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to issue partial credit guarantees (PCGs) \nin  favor  of  eligible  Indian  financial  institutions  providing  credit  enhancement for  infrastructure \nproject bonds in India.1 \nII.  THE FACILITY \nA.  Identification and Description \n1.  Identification \n2.  The facility will support credit enhancements of project bonds to address one of India\u2019s key \ndevelopment challenges, namely to meet the infrastructure investment target of about $1 trillion \nduring the Twelfth Five-Year Plan for FY2012\u2013FY2016.2  The longstanding method of financing \nIndian infrastructure projects almost exclusively through loans from banks is no longer sustainable. \nThe banks do not have resources large enough to meet all the country\u2019s projected infrastructure \nfinancing needs and are also fast approaching their allowed sector exposure limits to infrastructure \nand their allowed group exposure limits to major infrastructure developers. Planning Commission \n(footnote  2)  is  projecting  a  potential  debt  financing  shortfall  of  $350  billion  in  infrastructure \ninvestment over the plan. This deficit could be addressed by tapping into India\u2019s large resource \npool of insurance and pension funds through bond markets. However, these funds have not been \nutilized for financing infrastructure; a chief constraint being that the statutory requirements require \nthat these funds invest only in assets rated AA or above. However, infrastructure assets are \ntypically rated BBB\u2013 to A, at best. The proposed facility by providing credit enhancement will raise \nthe credit rating of infrastructure project bonds to the required AA rating, thereby providing the \ncritical missing step required to mobilize infrastructure financing from pension and insurance funds \nand promote development of the domestic corporate debt market.  \n3.  The facility has been developed in partnership with India Infrastructure Finance Company \nLimited (IIFCL) and it dovetails other public\u2013private partnership (PPP) infrastructure development \ninitiatives by the government and ADB to support PPP enablers3 and provide long-term project \nfinance.4 Under the facility, IIFCL, which is a domestic AAA entity, will issue PCGs in support of \ninfrastructure project bonds and ADB will assume a portion of the credit risk on the underlying \nproject from IIFCL by issuing it a counter guarantee.5 The PCGs will raise the rating of the project \nbonds to the AA level, which will enable domestic institutional investors to invest in the credit \nenhanced bonds.6 In addition to IIFCL, ADB will seek to partner with other eligible domestic \nfinancial institutions, namely participating financial institution (PFIs). Through the facility, ADB will \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2011.

New Delhi.   \n3  ADB has provided seven PPP-related technical assistance (TA) grants to support initiatives that have included \ncapacity development, project identification, and project development and structuring at both the state and central \nlevels. Additional TA has also been provided for project preparation and preparing project feasibility studies.  \n4  ADB. 2007.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on India \nInfrastructure Project Financing Facility. Manila (Loan 0037-IND, approved on 20 December 2009, for $700 million). \n5  IIFCL is a well established player in the Indian infrastructure financing space and is fully owned by the government. It \nis also specifically mandated to provide long-term financing for PPP infrastructure projects and also develop innovative \nfinancing instruments and in particular, promote and develop a credit enhancement product for infrastructure financing.     \n6  TA has demonstrated the commercial viability of PCGs in India. ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to India for Capacity \nDevelopment for India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited. Manila (TA 7030-IND, approved on 14 December, for \n$500,000). ", "2           \n \nact as a catalyst by seeding and participating in the first few pilot credit enhancement transactions \nso as to provide proof to the concept and give the market necessary confidence for a new and \ninnovative product. After the first successful pilot demonstration transactions, and as IIFCL and \nother PFIs develop the necessary capacity  to provide credit enhancement  on their own, the \ncomfort of ADB\u2019s risk participation and involvement will be less relevant and ADB can gradually \ndisengage from participating in the transactions.  \n    a.  Infrastructure Financing Issues \n4.  Commercial banks. PPP infrastructure projects in India depend on bank loans for over \n80% of their debt.7 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has indicated with concern that the  annual \ngrowth rate of bank exposure to infrastructure  was around 40% in FY2010.8 While the growth in \nexposure has moderated more recently to around 10%, with the current exposure standing around \n$100 billion to the infrastructure sector, banks are fast approaching sector exposure limits. With \ncountry\u2019s private sector debt requirements at around $350 billion for infrastructure, meeting this \nfinancing  need  will  require  banks  to  significantly  expand  their  infrastructure  portfolios  in  an \nenvironment where they face severe constraints. First, the banks have already reached close to \nmaximum sector exposure limit of 15%.9 Second, financing long-term infrastructure loans increase \nthe asset-liability management (ALM) mismatches in banks, due to their funding coming largely \nfrom short-term deposit base, which is a potential source of macroeconomic vulnerability.10 Third, \nthe structural mismatch in tenor is passed on to the borrower in the form of loan rates being reset \nevery 1\u20133 years, carrying a potential increased financing cost which the borrower cannot always \npass on, which increases project risk and in turn can result in credit risk for banks. Taken as a \nwhole, these factors strongly suggest that infrastructure projects cannot rely exclusively on bank \nloans and need alternate sources of capital.  \n5.  Insurance funds. Insurance companies and pension and provident funds with investment \nfunds of around $190 billion and around $80 billion respectively in FY2011 are ideal sources of \nlong-term funds for the infrastructure sector.11 Under the norms prescribed by the Insurance \nRegulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) of India, insurance funds should invest 15% of their \ncontrolled funds in infrastructure and social sectors. However, the flow of credit from insurance \nfunds to infrastructure has been only around 7%\u20139% in the case of life insurance companies, and \nwhile larger in the case of non-life insurers, there is almost no flow of funds into actual projects.12 \nHowever, the insurance industry penetration in India was only around 5% in FY2010, and with \npremiums growing rapidly (at around 11% in FY2011 and 23% in FY2010), there is an immense \nopportunity for the industry to expand outreach and generate resources which can be invested in \ninfrastructure. A critical factor for the shortfall in investment lies in IRDA guidelines that require a \nminimum domestic AA rating, from domestic rating agencies, for investment assets before they \ncan qualify for such investment.13 Infrastructure projects are characterized by nonrecourse or \n                                                \n7  Banks refer to scheduled commercial banks, which are those banks which have been included in the Second Schedule \nof RBI Act, 1934. These banks satisfy the criteria laid down in section 42 (6) (a) of the RBI Act. Non-scheduled banks \nare mostly cooperative banks that are not active in infrastructure.  \n8  RBI. 2010. Financial Stability Report. Mumbai. \n9  RBI. 2011. Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2010\u20132011. Mumbai. \n10 RBI data indicates that, the ALM positive gap (positive differential in the tenors of assets over liabilities) in >5-year \nbucket constituted 42% of the total ALM positive gap, followed by 3\u20135 years (31%) and 1\u20133 years (27%). \n11 Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. 2011. Annual Report. Hyderabad. \n12 Even though these funds were invested in the broad infrastructure sector, they were largely absorbed by dedicated \ninfrastructure finance companies through bonds issued at the corporate level, with little if any going into direct project \nfinance. \n13 This is a requirement of the IRDA (Investment) Regulations (Amendment), 2001. As per IRDA, the investment assets \nshall be of a grade not less than AA based on their current rating. When investments with AA ratings are not available, \nan investment committee may, for reasons recorded in investment committee minutes, approve investments with \nratings of not less than A+, with A+ investments kept to the minimum. \n ", "        3 \nlimited recourse financing and present multiple financing risks. During construction, risks relate to \nconstruction, land acquisition, financing and cost escalations, and enforcement of property rights. \nDue to these risks, projects at inception typically get a low credit rating in the BBB- category. Even \nafter commercial operations begin, (defined as commercial operation date [COD]), ratings may \ntypically go up to BBB+ or A, at best, as demand, off taker and regulatory risk remain. Thus, \ninsurance funds are unable to meet investment goals in infrastructure due to non-availability of \nsufficiently rated assets.14   \n6.  The above circumstances strongly suggest the importance of developing the project bond \nmarket by establishing a credit enhancement product to improve infrastructure project bond credit \nratings, and create an investable asset class for insurance and pension funds. The funds raised \nthrough this mechanism will be used to prepay bank debt before its scheduled maturity and thus \nfree up bank resources to lend to new greenfield projects. India\u2019s banks have enough project \nfinance experience and risk appetite to take on greenfield project risk. Prepayment of bank debt \nthrough bond issuances by projects that have completed 2 years of operations post COD, implies \nthat banks will only have around 4 years of exposure to the projects (2 years of construction and 2 \nyears of operation) which is more in line with their liability profile in terms of short-term bank \ndeposits. This will mitigate their overall ALM imbalances.  For their part, long-term investors such \nas insurance companies and pension funds that invest in the credit-enhanced bonds will take on \nexposure to the projects through long-term bonds that match their long-term liabilities. Further, as \nthese bonds would be less risky, they could have greater liquidity and may be traded. Issuers will \nlook to refinance bank loans at lower rates when construction risks disappear. The projects will \nalso benefit from greater interest rate certainty. While banks lend at floating rates linked to the \ninterest rate cycle, bonds carry a fixed-rate making funding costs predictable. \n     b.  Policy Dialogue \n7.  The facility is based on almost 2 years of comprehensive policy dialogue with IIFCL,  the \nMinistry of Finance, the Planning Commission, the RBI, investment banks, institutional investors, \nand project developers.15 The results of this dialogue, which built stakeholder consensus, have \nbeen (i) periodic recapitalization of IIFCL by the government; (ii) Cabinet approval to declare IIFCL \na nonbank finance company and bring it under RBI supervision; (iii) approval of IIFCL\u2019s PCG \nscheme for pilot transactions by IIFCL\u2019s board; (iv) government approval for IIFCL to undertake \npilot  PCG  transactions  for  over  $700  million,  leading  to  the  formal  launch  of  IIFCL\u2019s  credit \nenhancement scheme by the finance minister on 5 January 2012; (v) capacity development on \nproject credit appraisal and due diligence within IIFCL to enable it to undertake PCG transactions; \nand (vi) drafting of a memorandum of understanding between IIFCL and insurance companies for \nthe  latter  to  absorb  credit-enhanced  bonds.  The  dialogue  was  sustained  by  ADB\u2019s  Capacity \nDevelopment TA for IIFCL16 which also provided guidance on guarantee structuring and indicated \nthat a first-loss PCG was particularly suitable.17 \n2.  Design \n8.  The figure illustrates the structure of the PCGs expected to be issued under the facility.  \n \n                                                \n14 Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15 IIFCL is a large client of ADB, having received loans for $1.2 billion under two multitranche financial facilities to \nsupport long-term debt financing for infrastructure projects (footnote 4). \n16 Attached  to  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed \nMultitranche Financing Facility to India for India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility. Manila (Loan 2404-IND, \napproved on 20 December, for $500 million). \n17 A first-loss PCG covers the entire bond service obligation on interest payment dates, covering interest and principal \npayments up to  a maximum cap amount, rather than partially covering a portion of debt service to bondholders. \n ", "4           \n \n \nStructure of Partial Credit Guarantees under the Facility \n \nProject bond issuance \n \nProject (special purpose    Bond \nvehic le)     investor s  \nRecourse in case \nof default    \nFirst-loss \ncredit \nguarantee \nCounter guarantee  Participating \n \n(up to 50% of  financial institution \nADB  participating financial  such   \ninstitution\u2019s gua rantee)  as IIFCL \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IIFCL = India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited.   ` \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n   \n  \n9.  Structure  of  partial  credit  guarantees.  The  PCGs  under  the  facility  will  involve  the \nfollowing main steps. First, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) operating an eligible infrastructure \nproject will issue a project bond. Second, an eligible PFI will enhance the credit of the project bond \nto AA level by providing a \u2015first loss\u2016 guarantee. Third, ADB will provide a counter guarantee to the \nPFI for up to 50% of the exposure assumed by it under the first loss guarantee.  In an enforcement \nsituation, the PFI will have access to the security of the underlying project assets, the proceeds of \nwhich will be shared with ADB on a pro rata basis. ADB will not have recourse to the sovereign or \nthe PFI in the event of default by the SPV on the bond obligations. ADB\u2019s guarantee fee will \ndepend on the underlying project risk and guarantee structure. The first loss structure has been \ndeveloped with guidance from rating agencies and is the most efficient way to lower the probability \nof default to bond holders and uplift credit of the underlying bonds. It essentially acts as a credit \nbuffer to bondholders and is attractive to ADB as it leverages scarce ADB resources. A small \namount of first loss guarantee for payments to bondholders (typically in the range of 20%\u201350% of \nthe outstanding principal)\u2014of which ADB will take only up to half\u2014can raise a bond\u2019s rating to the \nneeded AA level. This is a better use of resources than a full credit wrap covering 100% of the \namount of the bonds.18  \n10.  A critical aspect of ADB\u2019s development objective under the facility is the creation of a \ntemplate for replicating similar first-loss guarantees by IIFCL and other PFIs. ADB and the relevant \nPFIs will jointly (i) select projects to be supported under the facility, (ii) conduct due diligence of the \nprojects, and (iii) price and structure the credit enhancement of the project. The pilot transactions \nwill develop precedents for project documentation, bond documentation, guarantees, due diligence \nrequirements,  pricing  analysis,  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  objective  is  to  enable \nADB\u2019s counterparties to provide credit enhancement products on their own after ADB withdraws. \n \n                                                \n18 A technical note on the first-loss guarantee to provide meaningful credit enhancement is provided in Guarantee \nStructure and Sizing (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "        5 \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n11.  The impact will be the expansion of the debt market in India for infrastructure finance and \nproducts beyond bank loans. The facility will promote the diversification of infrastructure financing \nsources and support development of the bond market, complementing initiatives taken by RBI and \nthe  government.19    Specifically,  the  facility  will  bring  new  lenders  into  infrastructure  project \nfinancing, including insurance and pension funds, thereby diversifying funding options for these \nprojects. Fixed rate bonds will replace floating rate SCB loans20 that have periodic interest rate \nresets, thereby reducing project risk.     \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n12.  The outcome of the facility will be the demonstration of a commercially viable and replicable \nmodel for undertaking credit enhancement of infrastructure project bonds in India. Risk-based \npricing of the guarantee facility will set market benchmarks and result in efficient price discovery \nand sustainability. It will also lead to the matching of long-dated infrastructure assets with long-\ndated  insurance  and  pension  fund  liabilities.  While  the  bonds  under  the  first  demonstration \ntransaction will be privately placed, the possibility of public bond placement will be explored for \ntransactions that follow under the facility. The pilot transactions will demonstrate the viability of the \nPCG product in the infrastructure bond market and the precedents developed in the pilot phase will \nfacilitate the rolling out of the credit enhancement product in an effective manner. Successful pilot \ntransactions will in particular (i) enable IIFCL to mainstream credit enhancement as a new product \nand develop internal capacity by absorbing best practices through the partnership with ADB in the \npilot phase, (ii) encourage other interested PFIs to follow the IIFCL example once commercial \nviability has been established and offer the product, and (iii) demonstrate the applicability of the \nproduct across subsectors. \n3.  Output \n \n13.  The output will be 3\u25005 pilot infrastructure credit-enhanced AA rated infrastructure project \nbonds (termed as projects under the facility) launched by IIFCL and other PFIs. The facility will \nseek to support bonds issued from a cross section of infrastructure subsectors and by different \nproject developers. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n14.  Strategy 2020. The facility is designed to develop the local currency debt market to fund \ninfrastructure and is aligned with ADB's Strategy 2020.21 The facility supports two of ADB\u2019s five \ncore areas of operation under Strategy 2020\u2014infrastructure and financial sector development. The \n                                                \n19 Bond market development strategy rests on (i) regulatory and policy reforms, (ii) institution building, (iii) upgrading of \ntrading and settlement systems, (iv) strengthening of disclosure norms, and (v) expanding the set of investable \ninstruments and investors. The  facility targets the final aspect and is being undertaken in concert with  other \ngovernment and RBI interventions to address the remaining aspects. Specific initiatives include (i) allowing domestic \nfinancial intermediaries greater leeway to invest in corporate bonds, (ii) raising the limit on foreign investment in \ncorporate bonds, (iii) amending the bankruptcy code to protect rights of unsecured creditors, (iv) reducing transaction \ncosts in issuing and trading corporate bonds by reducing the need for repeated disclosures and lowering high stamp \nduties, and (v) reducing the preference of banks for loans over bonds by subjecting both assets to similar mark-to-\nmarket requirements. \n 20 The prepayment of bank loans with bond proceeds will free up capital that may be recycled by banks to lend to \ngreenfield projects and help reduce the mismatch between the banks\u2019 long-term assets and short-term deposits. \n21 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "6           \n \nfacility is consistent with a key Strategy 2020 goal of increasing cofinancing and optimizing use of \ncapital, by leveraging market resources.  \n \n15.  Country partnership strategy. ADB's India country partnership strategy for 2009\u20132012 \nemphasizes  infrastructure  development  and  is  based  on  four  pillars:  (i) inclusive  and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, (ii) catalyzing investment, (iii) increasing results orientation \nand knowledge solutions, and (iv) regional cooperation. The facility supports the first three pillars, \ngiven the linkage between growth and infrastructure development and the objective of catalyzing \ninfrastructure funds from a broad array of financial intermediaries. The country partnership strategy \nsupports the role of financial intermediaries in providing long-term financing for infrastructure, \nemphasizing the PPP modality. 22 \n \nD.  Lessons Learned \n16.  The facility design has recognized lessons learned from the 2008 global financial crisis. \nMonoline insurers in the United States and Europe experienced problems because they insured \ncomplex  securities  created  by  packaging  mortgages,  including  subprime  ones,  and  thereby \ndeparted from their traditional infrastructure business, which had steady and predictable cash \nflows. While these activities were lucrative in the short run, the insurers did not understand how \nrisky the underlying assets really were. The PFIs under the facility will focus on their core business \nof providing PCGs to bonds issued by infrastructure SPVs and not diversify into unrelated areas. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The facility will be available for 3 years after ADB Board of Directors approval and is \nexpected to support 3\u25005 projects. ADB\u2019s guarantee will not exceed 50% of the PFIs\u2019 exposure in \nthe underlying SPVs. The approval of eligible PFI and projects, as well as extent of partnership \nwith PFIs and exposure to projects under the facility, will be delegated to ADB\u2019s investment \ncommittee on a case by case basis and will take into account overall objectives of the facility and \nprevailing market conditions. The PFI will (i) have a domestic AAA rating from all major domestic \nrating agencies, (ii) obtain necessary clearances from the government and regulators, (iii) be in \ncompliance with applicable ADB and national safeguard and integrity policies, and (iv) have an \nestablished track record in financing infrastructure in India. The projects under the facility will be \nexpected to have (i) a minimum stand-alone bond rating without credit enhancement of BBB+, and \n(ii) completed at least 2 years of commercial operation. ADB and the PFI will jointly undertake \nproject selection, guarantee structuring, investor dialogue, and legal, financial, and credit due \ndiligence.23 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n18.  The facility will provide for ADB to issue PCGs in an aggregate amount of up to Rs7,168 \nmillion, including interest in favor of PFIs providing credit enhancement for infrastructure project \nbonds. When a PFI provides a PCG to the holder(s) of a project bond, ADB will in turn take up to \n50%  of  the  PFI\u2019s  credit  risk  by  issuing  it  a  counter  guarantee.  The  project  bonds  will  be \ndenominated in Indian rupees, as will be the underlying guarantees. \n \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n23 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "        7 \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n19.  ADB\u2019s value addition consists of knowledge transfer and the assumption of a portion of the \nrisks in the issuing of infrastructure project bonds: \n \n(i)  The pilot transactions will mark a first in India\u2019s bond market and demonstrate a \nproduct that can meet a key development priority by (a) diversifying infrastructure \nfinancing sources, (b) bridging the gap between the ratings of projects in need of \nfinance  and  the  rating  requirements  of  long-term  financing  sources  such  as \ninsurance and pension funds, (c) reducing dependence on banks for infrastructure \nfinancing and supporting development of the local debt market, and (d) replacing \nexisting floating rate bank financing with long-term fixed-rate financing through the \nbond market and thereby reducing project risk. \n(ii)  While IIFCL and other potential PFIs have the credit ratings needed to undertake \nPCG  transactions,  their  ability  to  launch  a  new  product  is  unproven.  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement through its assumption of part of the project risk through the joint \nexecution  of  the  pilot  transactions  will  be  critical  in  providing  credibility  to  the \ntransactions and building market confidence. \n(iii)  Partnering with ADB will enhance the capacity of IIFCL and other PFIs in credit and \nlegal due diligence and guarantee structuring. ADB inputs on due diligence and \npricing  will  be  needed  for  the  pilots  to  be  implemented  and  to  support  the \nmainstreaming of the PCG product in India. This approach is preferable to ADB \ndoing stand-alone, nonreplicable transactions. \n(iv)  Lessons from the PCG pilots may be considered by the government during policy \nreviews and may inform parallel initiatives to mainstream the credit enhancement \nproduct. These lessons may provide guidance on (a) whether the IRDA\u2019s AA rating \nthreshold can be lowered to facilitate bond issues, (b) potential initiatives to reduce \ntransactions costs in issuing bonds, and (c) possible impediments to bond financing \nin concession agreements that need to be addressed. \n \nC.  First Pilot Transaction \n20.  A  first  pilot  project  under  the  facility  is  in  advanced  stage  of  preparation.  Under  this \ntransaction,  IIFCL  will  enhance  the  credit  rating  of  a  bond  to  be  issued  by  GMR  Jadcherla \nExpressways Private Limited (GJEPL), which was incorporated in October 2005 as a SPV owned \nby GMR Group of Companies namely GMR Infrastructure, GMR Highways, and GMR Energy.24 \nThe  SPV  was  awarded  a  20-year  concession  through  competitive  bidding  by  the  National \nHighways Authority of India in February 2006 to design, engineer, construct, operate, maintain, \nand expand into four lanes the existing two-lane section of National Highway 7 from Farukhnagar \nto Jadcherla and to improve, operate, and maintain the four-lane stretch of the highway from \nThondapalli  to  Farukhnagar  on  a  build-operate-transfer  basis.25  The  toll  expressway  began \noperations in February 2009. The project cost of Rs5.2 billion ($92.2 million) was financed by a \nSCB loan of Rs3.5 billion ($62 million), equity of Rs1.2 billion ($21.2 million), and mezzanine \n                                                \n24 GMR Group was founded over 30 years ago with interests in energy, airports, roads, and urban infrastructure. GMR \nGroup is listed both on the Mumbai and National stock exchanges. As of 31 March 2011, the group had a portfolio of \n16 power, 4 airport, and 9 road projects (annuity projects totaling 1,198 lane km and toll projects totaling 2,150 lane \nkm). In FY2011, GMR Group had consolidated net revenues of Rs60.85 billion ($1.1 billion) and earnings before \ninterest, tax, depreciation, and amortization of Rs18.68 billion ($331.3 million). \n 25 Although  this  project  involves  a  toll  highway,  subsequent  projects may  also  include  annuity  projects.  Annuity \nconcessions are a variant of the build-operate-transfer model in which the private operator is remunerated via a fixed, \nperiodic payment (annuity) from the National Highways Authority of India rather than through tolls. Under these \ncontracts, the private operator is responsible for construction, operation, and maintenance for a fixed period. \n ", "8           \n \ncapital of Rs0.5 billion ($8.8 million). GJEPL will prepay the entire existing loan through a proposed \n12.5-year bond issue. \n \n21.  Guarantee structure. IIFCL will guarantee the payment of the outstanding principal and \ninterest of the bond in Indian rupees which translates up to 28% of the outstanding principal.26 \nIIFCL\u2019s partial guarantee will raise the proposed bond\u2019s stand-alone domestic credit rating of A \nwithout credit enhancement to AA. In its turn, ADB will issue a guarantee to IIFCL for 50% (ADB\u2019s \nportion) of IIFCL\u2019s exposure under its own guarantee, thereby sharing the risk with respect to the \nunderlying project.27 IIFCL\u2019s PCG (and therefore also ADB\u2019s) will be a first-loss guarantee (footnote \n17). After IIFCL has paid its obligations under the guarantee, it will have recourse to the project \nassets,  subject  to  applicable  waterfall  provisions,  and  must  share  any  recoveries  with  ADB \n(proportionate to the actual payments made by each under their respective PCGs). As PCGs are \nnew to IIFCL, its capacity will be augmented by ADB support. Concurrently, IIFCL will continue its \ncapacity  building  activities  in  credit  appraisal,  human  resources  and  skills,  organizational \nrestructuring, and system and software upgrades. Under the first transaction, ADB will share 50% \nof the underlying project risk for the first 5 years only and IIFCL will take full exposure for the \nresidual bond period. Any extension will require ADB approval. \n \n22.  Project  financials  and  risk  assessment.  The  project  tollway  links  Hyderabad  and \nBangalore, both state capitals and major cities, with several industries located along its route. The \nfinancing agreements for the project were signed on 18 August 2006 and commercial operation \nbegan on 12 February 2009. A conservative sensitizing of the financial model provided by the \nsponsor indicated that the project is expected to have robust cash flows and adequate debt service \ncoverage ratio. Under base case scenarios, GJEPL is financially viable and the expected financial \ninternal rate of return at 14%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 10.8%.28 \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigations \n23.  Credit enhancement is new to India and its success and viability depends on several \nfactors,  including  supply  and  demand  of  the  product  which  cannot  be  currently  determined. \nHowever, ADB\u2019s credit risk depends on its exposure to individual projects under the facility. The \nkey general risks are as follows: \n \n(i)  Product  sustainability.  A  risk  of  poor  product  sustainability  will  arise  if  the \neconomics of the transaction are not viable for the issuer, bondholders, or the credit \nenhancers. The sustainability of the program will be at risk if PFIs and ADB cannot \nachieve adequate pricing for the credit enhancements provided. Other risk factors \ninclude high long-term bond interest rates, availability of low cost bank financing \nand inability of the PFI to carry out transactions on their own once pilot transactions \nare completed and ADB withdraws. This risk will be mitigated to some extent by the \npricing of the transaction, which will take market benchmarks and risk-based pricing \ninto account, by selecting PFIs that have experience in infrastructure financing, and \nby improving the technical capacity of these PFIs when necessary. Nonetheless, \nthis is a new product and its long-term viability has not been tested in India. \n(ii)  Counterparty risk to participating financial institution. ADB does not take any \ncredit risk on the PFI and is ultimately exposed to underlying project risk. There \ncould be some settlement risk with the PFI, but this is expected to be minimal given \n                                                \n26 ICRA Ratings Limited provided a guidance of 24% as the extent of coverage required to enhance the rating of the \nstand-alone A rating to AA. A number of 28% has been indicated as the outside range of the extent of coverage \nneeded. An overview of the structure and mechanics of guarantee cover is provided in Guarantee Structure and Sizing \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 ADB\u2019s maximum aggregate liability under its guarantee for the first pilot transaction will be up to Rs448 million. \n28 Financial Analysis, and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "        9 \nthe AAA domestic credit rating of the PFI. Notwithstanding, it is crucial for PFIs to \nhave a minimum level of technical skills to identify projects in line with the selection \ncriteria. In addition, the PFI could select weak projects and incorrectly price risk but \nthis will be mitigated because ADB will select projects, price risk, and undertake \nproject level due diligence along with the PFI. With respect to the first PFI, there are \nsome issues on the choice of IIFCL due to concerns in its ability to undertake \nindependent project assessment. However, this risk is mitigated by the ongoing \ncapacity building technical assistance provided by the World Bank and government \nsupport to IIFCL to promote credit enhancement products for infrastructure. \n(iii)  Project risk. The following are expected to be key risks of the underlying eligible \nprojects: demand risk, off-take risk, operation and maintenance risk, sponsor risk, \ntariff risk, and concessionaire risk. These risks will be partially mitigated by choosing \ntransactions with a minimum BBB+ credit rating from local rating agencies, good \nsponsors, and projects that have been completed 2 years of operations. However, \nrisks may vary by individual project and will need to be examined in detail and \naddressed on a case-to-case basis. For the first SPV GJEPL, the project is primarily \nexposed  to  risks  related  to  traffic  volatility  in  its  concession  area  and  tariff \nescalation,  which  is  compensated  by  the  lack  of  completion  risk  and  minimal \noperation and maintenance risk due to the straightforward operations of the toll road. \n(iv)  Regulatory  risk.  ADB  has  carried  out  due  diligence  to  assess  the  legal  and \nregulatory risks to the first pilot transaction. The enabling legislative and regulatory \nbasis for ADB and PFIs to enter transactions has been examined, as have the \napprovals needed from the government and RBI. This project, like all others, is \nexposed to regulatory risks but is strongly supported by the government given its \nalignment with initiatives to develop India\u2019s bond market. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n24.  The facility is classified as category FI with respect to ADB\u2019s environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 policies, and will comply with the applicable requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). A compliance audit of the environmental and social \nsafeguards  performance  of  the  national  highway  operated  and  maintained  by  GJEPL  was \nconducted by IIFCL and provided to ADB for clearance. The audit revealed that the project is in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s and national safeguard policies as provided in IIFCL\u2019s environmental and \nsocial safeguards framework (ESSF) requirements.29 With respect to the GJEPL transaction, the \naudit requirement and monitoring and due diligence by IIFCL is integrated into IIFCL\u2019s ESSF. The \naudit revealed that GJEPL needed to adopt an emergency preparedness and response plan, \nwhich was then developed. The audit report, the operational phase environment management \nplan,  including  the  emergency  preparedness  and  response  plan  and  other  measures  to  be \nimplemented by GJEPL and monitored by ADB and IIFCL, are available on ADB\u2019s website.30  \n \n25.  Finally, GJEPL or any other client will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and \nreport on the compliance (including contractors) with national labor laws and/or adherence to \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with \n                                                \n29 IIFCL\u2019s ESSF can be accessed from http://www.iifcl.org/Content/ESMU.aspx and the Environmental and Social \nSafeguards Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 IIFCL has sufficient capacity to ensure project compliance with the requirements of the ESSF. It established an \nenvironmental and social management unit in February 2010 and has five staff positions for a head of unit, two \nenvironment specialists, and two social safeguard specialists. A review of IIFCL\u2019s ESSF, including a 2010 audit of \nADB-supported IIFCL projects, revealed overall compliance with the ESSF requirements.  \n \n ", "10           \n \naffected people are conducted in accordance with ADB requirements and the ESSF of the PFI will \nmonitor compliance with core labor standards and applicable national labor laws and regulations.  \n \n26.  ADB will require other PFIs it considers partnering with under the facility to establish an \nESSF consistent with IIFCL\u2019s ESSF and ADB safeguard requirements before finalizing a risk \nparticipation arrangement. Given that projects eligible under this facility should have  been in \ncommercial operation for at least 2 years, an environmental and social compliance audit, including \nan on-site assessment, will be conducted by the project sponsor31 to determine whether relevant \nactions were in accordance with the requirements prescribed by ADB\u2019s and national safeguard \npolicies.32 In case of outstanding compliance issues, a corrective action plan agreed to by ADB \nand the PFI and the project sponsor will be prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n27.  IIFCL, the issuer, and GMR Group were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date)  and its policy of implementing best international practice relating to combating \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment \ndocumentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the \nfinancing  of terrorism, and  remedies for  ADB  in  the  event  of  noncompliance.  Future  eligible \nfinancial institutions, issuers, and their sponsors will be advised of the same.  \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n28.  The proposed PCG is within the country, industry, group, and single-project exposure limits \nfor nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n29.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),33 \nthe Government of India has confirmed that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nIIFCL, and will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to other \nPFIs when this becomes relevant. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n30.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  guarantee  facility  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nguarantee facility for ADB to issue partial credit guarantees without government counter guarantee, \nin amounts, in aggregate, of up to Rs7,168,000,000 Indian Rupees from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  in  favor  of  eligible  Indian  financial  institutions  providing  credit  enhancement  for \ninfrastructure  project  bonds  in  India,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board.  \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n30 August 2012 \n                                                \n31 In most cases, it is expected that the project proponent will conduct the audit. Alternatively, if the issues expected are \nrelatively minor and the scope of the audit relatively small, the PFI and ADB will conduct the audit. \n32 In the case of the first project, the GJEPL, the audit was conducted in accordance with IIFCL\u2019s ESSF. \n33 ADB. 1966.
