In 2005, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan requested technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for preparing the Second Education Sector \nReform  Project  (the  Project).  The  TA  is  included  in  the  2006\u20132008  country  strategy  and \nprogram update.1 ADB is currently financing the Education Sector Reform Project (ESRP),2 the \nimplementation progress of which is fully satisfactory. The Fact-Finding Mission was undertaken \nin March 2006, and reached agreement with the Government on the impact, outcome, scope, \ncost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the \nproposed TA.3\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since its independence in 1991, the Republic of Tajikistan has had increasing difficulties \nmaintaining the universal primary education and high literacy  achieved during the Soviet period. \nDeclining  budget  resources  and  rising  poverty  have  caused  deterioration  in  the  quality  of \neducation and a decline in access to primary and secondary education by school-age children. \nThe consequences of the civil war that ended in 1997 further worsened access to and quality of \neducation, particularly for the poor. The gross enrollment rate in basic education was 84.5% in \n2004, compared with 97% in 1991.  \n \n3.  The  Government\u2019s  goal  is  to  establish  a  relevant  education  system  that  provides \nuniversal  access  to  quality  education  for  the  country\u2019s  children  and  young  people,  and  is \nappropriate to the country\u2019s needs. Tajikistan has taken significant steps to reform the education \nsector and to ensure equity and equality with respect to quality education. However, major \nchallenges remain.  \n \n4.  Insufficient funding is an obstacle to the delivery of quality education. State expenditure \non education was 3.2% of GDP or 17.1% of the public budget in 2004, compared with 2% of \nGDP or 16% of the public budget in 2000. More efficient use of resources and improvements in \neducation financing are needed to improve the quality of education and ensure equitable access. \nOn  the  demand  side,  poor  families,  especially  those  with  many  school-age  children,  are \nparticularly burdened by the direct costs of education (e.g., books, clothing, stationery, and \ninformal payments). The country\u2019s annual population growth rate (about 2%) is the highest \namong the Central Asian republics. More than 74% of the population resides in rural and remote \nmountainous areas. The education system is under growing pressure to improve the school \ninfrastructure and ensure that students reaching school age over the next 10 years will have \naccess  to  education.  Educational  quality  is  deteriorating  because  of  funding  constraints, \nparticularly in rural areas. Gender disparity is emerging: in 2004 just 38% of girls were enrolled \nin  grades  9\u201311.  School  attendance  and  completion  rates  in  lower  and  upper  secondary \neducation are lower for girls than for boys.4\n \n5.  The curriculum is currently overloaded with subjects and content requirements that do \nnot reflect modern learning methodologies. The national curriculum development policy and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Tajikistan. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Tajikistan for the Education Sector Reform Project. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 February 2006. \n4  Updated statistics on gender disparities in school attendance are not available. However, a report by the United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (1998) indicates that there were 89 girls per 100 boys enrolled in lower secondary \neducation. \n ", "2   \nframework needs to take into account standards, student competencies, textbook content, and \nthe national student assessment system. Several education sector funding agencies have been \nrevising the curriculum and developing textbooks, including the ADB-supported ESRP, which is \nsupporting  curriculum  revision  for  two  subjects  in  two  grades.  Despite  external  support, \ntextbooks,  learning  materials,  and  learning  aids  are  still  lacking,  particularly  in  secondary \neducation, and in the languages of ethnic groups.   \n \n6.  The learning assessment systems lack modern approaches for improving (i) the quality \nof education of school children transiting from primary to secondary education, (ii) assessment \nof what students learn during the school year, and (iii) assessment of school graduates entering \nhigher education institutions. The Government established two national testing centers in 2006 \nto assess the knowledge of high school graduates entering universities. However, the learning \nassessment systems need to be strengthened and modernized.  \n \n7.  Teacher remuneration and incentives are low, making it difficult to attract and retain \nteachers for science and language subjects, particularly in rural areas. There is a lack of \nscience, language, and information communication technology teachers in secondary education, \nparticularly  in  remote  mountainous  areas.  Stronger  support  for  strengthening  teachers\u2019 \nprofessional  development,  including  in-service  teacher  training,  is  required  to  support  and \nsuccessfully implement reforms in the curriculum and the learning assessment system. \n \n8.  The  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  paper,  which  was  endorsed  by  the \nParliament in June 2002, notes that the efficient and equitable provision of basic social services \nto vulnerable groups is an effective approach to poverty reduction. In 2005, about 63% of the \npopulation lived below the poverty line. The Government is updating the Poverty Reduction \nStrategy paper for 2006\u20132010, and is developing the National Development Strategy for 2006\u2013\n2015. The National Strategy for Educational Development (NSED) for 2006\u20132015 sets out key \npriorities in the education sector, serves as an overall strategy for education reforms, and \nincludes plans for achieving the education-related Millennium Development Goals, and the \nEducation For All objectives. The NSED requires detailed plans in order to implement the \noverall strategy for education reforms. \n \n9.  The TA design builds on the initial achievements of and experience gained under ADB-\nsupported projects, in particular the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project5 and the ongoing ESRP, \nsupported by the ongoing the School Improvement Project6 and attached TA.7 These projects \nhave provided assistance in accordance with the country\u2019s sector priorities in the areas of \neducation, poverty reduction and economic growth. The TA outcomes will build on results \nachieved by these projects, and include improving access to education in rural mountainous \nareas, developing an education management information system at the MOE, based on data \ncollected through school mapping, and strengthening MOE capacity in education planning and \nmanagement.  \n \n10.  A major lesson learned is the importance of aid coordination in addressing sector-wide \npolicy  and  strategy  priorities.  The  TA  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  grant  from  the \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1999.

Other lessons learned \ninclude the importance of stakeholder participation and community involvement in project design. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA will prepare a project that will contribute to an improved education system \nresponsive to the needs of a modern economy and supportive of poor, disadvantaged children, \nparticularly girls and children with special needs. The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n12.  The project proposal will address key issues facing the education sector, and will include \ntechnical reports outlining recommendations regarding (i) a school development plan, (ii) a plan \nfor developing and providing textbooks and learning materials, and (iii) a plan for modernizing \nlearning assessment and teacher development. The project proposal will be in a format suitable \nfor funding by ADB and consistent with the NSED.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will assist the Government review and update sector policies, analyze sector \nneeds, and outline recommendations for action plans. It will assess achievements, progress, \nand remaining priorities, taking into consideration progress under the ESRP and projects funded \nby other funding agencies. Specific TA activities will include (i) identifying key medium- and \nlong-term  reform  measures  and  assessing  policy  alternatives;  (ii)  reviewing  sector  policy \ndocuments, strategies and action plans to address priorities and investment needs; and (iii) \nproviding interim and final reports containing detailed proposals for the project design, detailed \ncost estimates, institutional arrangements, and fiscal implications. The TA will (i) analyze current \neducation sector expenditures and make recommendations on improving system efficiency and \nresource allocation and utilization; and (ii) review the medium-term expenditure framework for \nthe education sector, focusing on fiscal sustainability, and prioritize functions by capital and \nrecurrent  expenditures.  These  activities  will  lay  the  groundwork  for  initiating  a  sector-wide \napproach initiative. The TA will include a study tour for MOE and Ministry of Finance education \nplanning and financing specialists to an ADB member country, to facilitate the exchange of \nexperience regarding alternative approaches for delivering and financing education services. \nThe TA will ensure direct participation of key education stakeholders through close consultation. \nThe TA will focus on the three principal areas outlined below. \n \n14.  Sustainability of School Facilities. The TA will examine school rehabilitation needs \nnationwide, based on the results of the MOE\u2019s recent school mapping surveys and aid agencies\u2019 \nstudies and reports; it will focus on the investment needs of schools in remote mountainous \nareas with the lowest enrollment and attendance rates. Based on these surveys and school \nmapping  results,  the  TA  team  will  determine  school  capacity  utilization,  and  needs  for \nrehabilitation and upgrading of the school network. The TA will recommend necessary changes \nin building standards and requirements, and prepare a school development plan, with costs, \n                                                 \n8  Ministry of Education. 2006.

The plan will serve as the basis for school \ndevelopment reform measures and investment activities under the project. The TA will also \nexamine issues related to school accessibility for disadvantaged children and children with \nspecial needs. \n \n15.  Curriculum, Textbooks, and Learning Materials. The TA will review (i) the national \ncurriculum, including curriculum content, plans, standards, requirements, and competencies; (ii) \nthe national policy on curriculum development; and (iii) initiatives undertaken by the ongoing \nESRP and other funding agencies. The TA will identify current and medium-term needs for \ntextbooks, learning materials, teachers\u2019 guidebooks, and learning aids, particularly for subjects \nin which the most severe shortages are being experienced. Based on these assessments, the \nTA will outline recommendations for a plan for providing textbooks and learning materials. The \nplan will be used as the basis for developing textbooks and learning materials under the project. \nParticular attention will be given to the needs of ethnic groups and children with special needs. \nThe TA will also prepare recommendations for a teacher training action plan, based on the \ncurriculum, textbooks, learning materials, and learning assessment. \n \n16.  Learning Assessment and Teacher Development. The TA will review and analyze the \ncapacity of existing learning assessment systems for using objective and performance-based \nmethods for assessment of children\u2019s attainment at primary and secondary schools. The TA will \nidentify key reform measures and outline recommendations for a modernization plan for learning \nassessment systems, drawing on relevant international experience. The plan will incorporate \ncurrent Government initiatives in learning assessment, including the establishment of a national \ntesting center. The action plan will be used as the basis for project activities in developing \nlearning assessment systems. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  review  reform  priorities  in  the  area  of  teacher  development,  including \ntraining, professional development programs, incentives, and remuneration. In addition, the TA \nwill  assess  education  financing,  decentralization  of  education  management,  private  sector \nparticipation in the delivery of educational services, the fostering of community participation, and \ngender equality in education. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $471,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested that ADB finance $400,000.

Access to education and the \nquality of education are the main priorities outlined in the nation\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy and the national \nStrategy for Education Development (2006\u20132015). Education is the key to better human development, a better \nworkforce and an educated society, and leads to better income opportunities, but also to higher value of education \nbenefits by parents for their children, and thus an escape from the poverty trap. The predominant focus of the TA on \nthe poor will contribute to preparation of the proposed project, which will aim to reduce poverty, contribute to \nsustainable economic growth, and in particular will address the gap emerging between urban and rural schools in the \nquality of and access to education.  \n \n \nB.
