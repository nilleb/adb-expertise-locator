A developed \nfinancial system will improve savings mobilization and financial intermediation, more efficiently \nallocate  resources  for  productive  investments,  and  allow  risk  spreading and risk pooling. \nHowever, the transition economies in Central Asia and the Caucasus (CACs) have yet to \nestablish a financial system that fulfills these functions. \n \n2.  While financial sector development in CACs is constrained by various factors, the small \nsize of the economies is probably the single most important one.1 Financial institutions have \nmore-than-usual problems to reduce transaction cost through economies of scale, and financial \nmarket activity cannot easily reach a critical volume to increase liquidity and realize economies \nof scale. To overcome this constraint, CACS will have to integrate their financial markets with \neach other or with larger ones. While this is not achievable in the near future, the countries \ncould gradually move towards integration by harmonizing standards and regulations according \nto international best practices. \n  \n3.  Although all CACs have been confronted with similar development challenges over the \nlast decade, the pace and progress of reforms, particularly in the financial sector, has been \nuneven across the region. CACs must address a long list of weaknesses to pave the way to \nharmonization  and  financial  integration.  However,  at  least  three  key  constraints  warrant \nimmediate attention in all countries in the region: (i) risk management in the banking sector, \n(ii) more reliable financial disclosure, and (iii) improved corporate governance in companies \nseeking access to finance. Improvement is not only critical to expand national financial markets \nbut also to facilitate cooperation and integration with each other and/or with larger financial \nmarkets. A regional approach to strengthening financial sector regulations will offer CACs \nopportunities to address common weaknesses, share experiences, and maintain the momentum \nto adopt regulations in line with international standards and practices. \n \n4.  The proposed regional technical assistance (RETA)2 will cover Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, and aims to harmonize and strengthen (i) banking \nsector regulation with regard to risk management, (ii) financial disclosure standards, and (iii) the \nregulatory framework for corporate governance. The RETA also aims to foster knowledge \nsharing among participating countries. The RETA framework is presented in Appendix 1. The \nRETA is part of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program initiated by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in 1996, and complements other program initiatives by facilitating \nfinancial sector development and cooperation within the region. \n                                                 \n1  Despite progress made, the financial sectors remain small and dominated by banks. At the end of 2002, banking \nsector assets ranged from 10.0% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the Kyrgyz Republic to 25.0% in Kazakhstan, \nequity market capitalization from 0.3% to 9.0%, and corporate bond market capitalization from 0.2% to 3.0%. The \ninsurance sector\u2019s share in GDP ranged from 0.6% in Kazakhstan to negligible in other CACs. In 2002, CAC GDP \nranged from $1.5 billion in the Kyrgyz Republic to $24 billion in Kazakhstan. \n2 The RETA was listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 March 2003. Two fact-finding missions were fielded on \n4\u201310 July in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic, and on 18\u201320 August in Uzbekistan.  ", "2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The specifics of the three identified areas are the following: \n  \n6.  Risk Management. Banking sector regulations have been strengthened in all CACs, \nand authorities now impose minimum requirements for capital and liquidity, and limits on asset \nconcentration. Supervisory frameworks have also been strengthened by improving on-site and \noff-site inspection to monitor compliance with regulations. However, remaining regulatory gaps \nincrease the sector\u2019s vulnerability and undermine depositor and investor confidence. One of \nthese gaps, identified in all five countries, is weak capacity of the banking sector regulator \n(Appendix  2)  to  assess  systemic  risk  in  the  banking  system  in  line  with  the  Basel  Core \nPrinciples  for  Banking  Supervision,  and  to  take  proactive  measures  to  establish  risk \nmanagement in line with the Basel Capital Accord.  \n \n7.  With no guidelines on methods and institutional arrangements to ensure effective risk \nmanagement  in  commercial  banks,  most  banks  avoid  rather  than  manage  risk.  This  is \nevidenced by weak lending levels in most countries, unusually high collateral requirements, high \nreal  interest  rates,  and  short-term  credit  maturities.  Improving  regulatory  authorities\u2019 \nunderstanding  of,  and  establishing  proper  guidelines  on,  basic  principles  of  managing \ncredit/counterpart, market, operational, and other risks are, therefore, crucial to develop efficient \nfinancial sectors and improve financial intermediation and resource mobilization. To ensure \nfinancial stability, CAC banking sector regulators also need capacity building to anticipate and \nmanage systemic risk. The focus of supervision must be changed from merely monitoring \ncompliance to a more proactive and risk-based approach. \n \n8.  Financial  Disclosure  and  Corporate  Governance.  All  five  countries  have  made \nprogress in adopting legislation and regulations in line with international best practices. Basic \ncorporate governance requirements are outlined in corporate laws, and corporate governance \nethic codes have been or are being developed. CACs have also formally adopted or are in the \nprocess of formally adopting international accounting standards (IAS). Accountants have been \ntrained in IAS. However, compliance is still low. Regulators (Appendix 2) lack capacities to \nmonitor  and  support  compliance  with  these  standards  in  enterprises.  Enforcement  of \nregulations, particularly those related to financial disclosure and corporate governance, remains \nweak. Market pressure on noncompliant companies is mostly absent as the market is small.3 \n \n9.  While commercial banks generally comply with regulations, only a small number of \nnonfinancial joint stock companies (JSCs) can meet requirements for financial disclosure and \ncorporate governance. These JSCs, which are typically export oriented, have better access to \nfinance through bank credit, foreign direct investment, and, in some cases, domestic and foreign \ncapital markets. However, most medium-sized and large JSCs do not follow regulations on \nfinancial disclosure and corporate governance. With questionable reported balance sheets, \ncombined with poor corporate governance that does not, among other things, hold management \naccountable for the misuse of companies\u2019 resources, these firms have considerable difficulty \ngaining access to credit. For the same reasons, these enterprises have almost no access to \ndirect or portfolio investors, particularly as poor corporate governance in these enterprises fails to \nprotect  shareholder\u2019s  rights.  Unless  corporate  governance  in  JSCs  and  financial  disclosure \nrequirements are strengthened, investors\u2019 confidence will remain weak, preventing JSCs from \ngaining access to capital markets and undermining development of CACs\u2019 financial sector.  \n                                                 \n3  Only a fraction of shares of JSCs, if any, are traded, and the market lacks depth. ", "    3 \n \n10.  The  RETA  incorporates  lessons  learned  from  three  loans,4  with  regard  to  risk \nmanagement as a remaining key weakness in banking sector regulation, and difficulties of \nintroducing and enforcing regulations on financial disclosure and corporate governance. A \ntechnical assistance (TA) has provided effective measures to facilitate conversion of major \nJSCs to IAS, which can be replicated.5 In risk management, the RETA will complement another \nTA.6 In the area of corporate governance, the RETA will build on and complement three TA.7 \nThe RETA also incorporates findings of ADB\u2019s Diagnostic Studies of Accounting and Auditing \nPractices. Preliminary findings of ADB\u2019s work on banking sectors and capital markets in CACs \nhave been taken into account. \n \n11.  The RETA will benefit from IAS training provided to local accountants under projects \nfunded by  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), European Union (EU-TACIS), \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  and  other  external  funding \nagencies in the region, and from TA provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to \nstrengthen banking sector supervision and regulation in the region.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  (i)  strengthen  banking  sector  regulation  in  line  with \ninternational  risk  management  standards,  (ii)  strengthen  financial  disclosure  by  facilitating \ntransition  to  IAS,  (iii)  improve  the  regulatory  framework  for  corporate  governance,  and \n(iv) facilitate knowledge sharing between participating countries.  \n \n13.  The outputs will include the following: \n \n(i)  reviews  of  banking  sector  risk  management  regulations,  surveys  on  risk \nmanagement practices, country-specific strategies to introduce risk management \nin line with  Basel Core Principles for Banking Supervision and Basel Capital \nAccord,  training, and knowledge sharing;  \n(ii)  IAS implementation guidelines, regional knowledge sharing, and training; and \n(iii)  a strategy to strengthen regulation of corporate governance in nonfinancial JSCs, \nand sharing of knowledge on enforcement of corporate governance regulations. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999.
