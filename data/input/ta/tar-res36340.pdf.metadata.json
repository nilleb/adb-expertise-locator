INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In January 1997, the Public Sector Committee (PSC) of the International Federation of \nAccountants (IFAC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) \nto support a program for development and production of a series of accounting guidelines and \nstandards to enhance financial reporting, accounting, and auditing in the public sector.1 The \naccounting  guidelines  and  standards  would  be  applicable  to  most  governments  of  ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). To help IFAC undertake the program, ADB approved a \nregional technical assistance (RETA)2 in August 1997. The World Bank and United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) cofinanced the RETA by providing $600,000 and $205,000, \nrespectively.  \n2.  The RETA was successfully completed in August 2001. Under it, 17 international public \nsector accounting standards (IPSASs), among others, were released. The IPSASs became the \nfoundation for achieving the long-term objectives of (i) moving to full accrual accounting in the \nnext 10 years for developed countries; (ii) improving quality and reliability of accounting and \nfinancial  reporting  for  developing  countries;  and  (iii)  harmonizing  DMCs\u2019  accounting  and \nfinancial  reporting  with  those  of  multilateral  financial  institutions,  including  ADB.  Following \nsuccessful completion of the RETA, IFAC requested ADB to provide a second phase to finance \nthe remaining and ongoing accounting standard development program for 2002\u22122005. \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  While PSC have developed and produced a series of accounting guidelines, standards, \nand studies under the first phase of the TA, many important tasks remain to be completed. The \nfirst phase program of PSC could not fully cover all the public sector accounting issues and \nconcerns,  including  accounting  practices  of  DMCs  and  their  limited  financial  and  human \nresources. For instance, the PSC program focused mainly on establishing accounting standards \nfor accrual basis accounting while most governments, even in developed countries, use cash \nbasis accounting.  Adopting accrual basis accounting requires a tremendous level of financial \nand  human  resources,  and  information  technology,  and  is  a  long-term  process  that  DMC \ngovernments need to pursue gradually.  \n4.  Accrual basis accounting is widely accepted as more comprehensive and transparent \nthan cash basis accounting.  However, PSC should have paid equal attention to setting up \ntransitional guidelines and procedures from cash to accrual basis accounting, considering that \nmost  DMC  governments  are  still  using  cash  basis  accounting.  During  consultation  with \nrepresentatives  of  IFAC  member  countries,  DMC  governments,  accounting  bodies,  the \naccounting profession, and multilateral financial institutions, PSC recognized the complexity of \nestablishing accounting standards for the public sector and enhanced the work program for the \nnext phase to address concerns and issues raised.  \n5.  The ongoing and remaining work program of PSC will have significant impact on DMCs\u2019 \nfinancial  and  accounting  reporting  requirements  and  auditing  procedures  as  IFAC  was \nestablished  to  provide  accounting  standards  for  the  accountancy  bodies  and  profession \nworldwide. IFAC\u2019s broad objective is to develop and harmonize accounting standards in a \ncoordinated manner for the worldwide accountancy profession. IFAC has representation from \n                                                 \n1 \u201cPublic sector\u201d refers to national governments; regional (state, provincial, territorial) governments; local   (city, town) \ngovernments; and related government entities (agencies, boards, commissions, enterprises). \n2  ADB. 1997.   Technical Assistance for Government Accounting Standards ($245,000). Manila. ", "2   \n156 professional accountancy bodies in 114 member countries, of which 35 are ADB member \ncountries. The IFAC member bodies represent approximately 2 million accountants in public \nand private practice, academia, and government service.3  Standing committees have been set \nup  to  draft  accounting  standards,  guidelines,  and  study  reports  to  achieve  IFAC\u2019s  broad \nobjective. PSC was established in 1987 for those in public sector financial management and \nreporting, accounting, and auditing. \n6.   Following successful completion of the first phase of the work program,  PSC developed \nthe second phase for 2002\u22122005, considering DMCs\u2019 needs, and  comments expressed during \nconsultation. The second phase covers, among others, issuance of (i) guidelines on transition to \naccrual basis accounting, (ii) IPSASs for cash basis accounting and financial reporting, (iii) an \ninvitation to comment on the exposure draft on taxes and non-reciprocal revenues, and (iv) an \ninvitation to comment on the international framework on public sector financial reporting. The \nsecond phase of the work program of PSC is thus in line with ADB\u2019s development agenda on \ngood governance, anticorruption, and enhanced internal control system.  \n7.  Throughout implementation of the proposed second phase TA, ADB, as an observer in \nPSC,  will  be  able  to  direct  and  guide  PSC  in  drawing  up  exposure  drafts  and  IPSASs, \nparticularly to implement accrual basis accounting, standardize cash basis accounting, and \nenhance DMCs\u2019 institutional capacities to prepare financial statements in line with generally \naccepted accounting principles. The TA will also contribute directly to ADB\u2019s long-term objective \nof harmonizing DMCs\u2019 accounting and financial reporting. \n8.  The second phase TA is included in the 2002 Interregional Knowledge Products and \nServices Work Plan and was endorsed by ADB\u2019s Knowledge Management Committee on 27 \nFebruary 2002.4   The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The overall objective of the TA is to enhance financial reporting, accounting, auditing, \nand  good  governance  of  public  sector  entities.  The  output  will  directly  benefit  developing \ncountries and international aid agencies, including ADB DMCs. \n10.  The  second  phase  of  the  work  program  consists  of  two  main  components:  (i) \nstandardization of cash basis accounting, and (ii) further development of accrual basis IPSASs \nrelated  to  specific  topics.  The  outputs  and  specific  deliverables  include  a  set  of  coherent \nguidelines for governments on cash basis accounting and the application of IPSASs. The PSC \nwork program is in Appendix 2.     \nB.  Methodology  and Key Activities \n11.  The main outputs of the second phase work program for 2002\u22122005 are (i) complete \ndevelopment of IPSASs for cash basis accounting; (ii) finalize IPSASs for the three exposure \ndrafts under review; (iii) draft IPSASs on a number of key public sector issues dealing with such \n                                                 \n3  Many professional accountancy bodies from ADB DMCs \u2212 Bangladesh, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Fiji \nIslands, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam are \nmembers of IFAC.  Other newly established accountancy bodies from transitional economies are also in the \nprocess of joining IFAC. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 17 June 2002. ", "  3\nmatters as accounting for nonreciprocal revenues, including taxes and social policy obligations, \nand budget reporting; (iv) implement activities to promote IPSASs; and (v) with support from the \nInternational Accounting Standards Board (IASB), translate IPSASs into five key languages \nother than English, such as Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish. \n12.  All IPSASs developed during the second phase work program will be published and \ndistributed to all IFAC member countries, and can be downloaded from the IFAC website. \nIPSAS exposure drafts and the studies will be made available free of charge. Hard copies will \nbe mailed directly to some 1,500 registrants on IFAC and PSC mailing lists, including all ADB \nDMCs. Copies can be downloaded free of charge at http://www.ifac.org.   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The  total  cost  for  the  second  phase  work  program  is  estimated  at  $3.622  million \nequivalent, in foreign exchange. ADB will provide $245,000, on a grant basis, from the ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. Other multilateral aid agencies also committed to provide parallel financing \nof $3.377 million are (i) the World Bank $1.400 million, including $1.000 million for the second \nphase TA, and $400,000 as an extension of existing TA; (ii) International Monetary Fund (IMF) \n$200,000; (iii) Inter\u2212American Development Bank (IDB) $327,000; (iv) Public Expenditure and \nFinancial Accountability Program (PEFA)5  $50,000; and (v) financing by a consortium including \nthe United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), Task Force on Donor \nPractices of the Organization for Economic Co\u2212operation and Development (OECD\u2212DAC), \nUnited  States  Treasury,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID), \nCanadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and others $1.400 million.  Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  PSC, the executing agency of the earlier RETA, will also be the Executing Agency for \nthe TA.  PSC will administer TA funds and make all related organizational and administrative \narrangements in accordance with standard procedures. As an observer of the subcommittees of \nPSC, ADB will monitor and directly supervise TA activities.  PSC will benefit from ADB\u2019s \nexperience and technical expertise. ADB will also provide direct input to the work of PSC by \nreviewing its exposure drafts and reflecting on comments from IFAC\u2019s ADB member countries \nbefore IFAC issues any guidelines and directives. \n \n15.  TA implementation will commence in October 2002 and be completed in December \n2005.  TA funds will be released to IFAC annually in three installments based on submission of \nannual progress reports to ADB and the outputs indicated in the annual work program. The first \ninstallment would be disbursed to IFAC in late 2002 upon its signing of the TA letter agreement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $245,000 on a grant basis for \nGovernment  Accounting  Standards  (Second  Phase),  and  hereby  reports  this  action  to  the \nBoard. \n                                                 \n5  The PEFA Program is financed jointly by the World Bank, European Commission, and United Kingdom    \n   Department for International Development.
