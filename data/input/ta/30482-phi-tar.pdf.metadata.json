Following a request from the Government of the Repubhc of the Philippines, a Fact-\nfinding Mission was fielded in May 1997 to formulate technical assistance (TA) 1 for the\npreparation of a Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Plan Study (the Study). The Mission held\ndiscussions with Government officials, including the National Economic and Development\nAuthority (NEDA), the Department of Finance; the Department of Public Works and Highways;\nthe Department of the Interior and Local Government; the Department of Health; the\nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources, the Metropolitan Waterworks and\nSewerage System (MWSS), the Local Water Utilities Administration; the National Water\nResources Board; water districts (WDs); nongovernmerit organizations (NGOs); and local\ngovernment units (LGUs). An understanding was reached on the objective, scope, Cost\nestimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA.\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Water supply and sanitation services in the Philippines are still inadequate. Currently\nabout 70 percent of the population have access to a safe water supply and sanitary latrines.\nSo far, sector development has been hindered by inadequate water resources planning,\ninstitutional constraints, and the lack of financial resources. A national water summit was held\nin October 1996 and led to the enactment of the National Water Crisis Act to improve the\ndelivery of basic water supply services. The Government is planning to increase the popUlation\ncoverage of water supply service to 90 percent by 2000. The NEDA Board Resolution No. 6 of\n1996 shifted sector development responsibilities to the LGUs, most of which have inadequate\ncapabilities in water resources planning, and preparation and implementation of sector\nprojects. In June 1997, a Presidential Water Task Force was formed to address the sector\nissues, including the establishment of a Water Resources Authority for which draft legislation is\nnow being considered by the Congress. In August 1997, the Government successfully\nimplemented the privatization of the MWSS, which has been restructured to assume\nresponsibility as the regulatory body supervising the two private concessionaires.\n3. The need to further strengthen national policy, strategy, and operational frameworks\nfor the development of the water supply and sanitation sector is recognized. Other major\nconstraints are (i) inadequate institutional capabilities of WDs and LGUs in the areas of\nmanagement and operations; and (ii) limited availability of financial resources, caused partly by\npoor cost recovery and inadequate operation and maintenance practices.\n4. Past efforts to develop the water supply and sanitation sector focused mainly on the\nconstruction of physical facilities. The Government is now giving more attention to\nstrengthening sector policy, strategy, operational frameworks, and institutional capabilities.\nSpecific measures will be identified through an in-depth assessment of the implementation\nexperience so far, including private sector participation in the provision of water supply\nfacilities, and an analysis of emerging sector issues and trends. As part of this process, the\ncurrent medium-term plan will also be updated. The Study will provide an important input in the\nformulation of a sector investment plan and help the Government in further strengthening\ncooperation in the development of the sector. A Project Framework is attached as Appendix 1.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB ausiness Opportunities in September 1 96.", "Ill.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n5. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government in preparing a water supply and\nsanitation sector investment plan study, including a program for institutional capacity building\nand a program for possible external assistance. The plan will aim at the improvement of living\nconditions through better access to a safe water supply and sanitation services. The Study will\nprovide Government with a base for planning sector investments, assist the Bank to determine\nits future development role for the sector, and identify the need for institutional strengthening.\nB.\t Scope\n6. The Study focus will be on the preparation of a sector investment plan for the\nmedium term (1 999-2004), while also synthesizing the findings of previous studies. The Study\nwill be nationwide and give particular attention to decentralization initiatives, enhancing private\nsector participation, integrating water supply with sanitation, and enhancing participatory\nprocesses in the design and implementation of both urban and rural water supply and\nsanitation1 projects and programs. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are\nincluded in Appendix 2.\n7. The scope of work under the Study will include the preparation of recommendations\non:\n(i) strengthening sector policy and strategy frameworks, including identifying\nopportunities for enhancing private sector participation and improving the\npublic-private interface and the regulatory framework;\n(ii) strengthening the institutional framework of the sector, including supporting\ndecentralization initiatives involving the LGUs and strengthening coordination\nbetween the WDs and LGUs;\n(iii) sector development programs with an emphasis on the needs of medium and\nsmall towns and countrywide development, and on identifying innovative\napproaches;\n(iv) measures for financial strengthening, including recommendations on financial\nmanagement, cost recovery/cost sharing, and reducing unaccounted for water;\n(v) enhancing the participatory process including community consultations,\nwomen's involvement, and involved Central Government and local and\nprovincial government agencies; and a more focused approach targeting the\npoor and indigenous people, and involving a regional focus including\nMindanao;\nExcluding solid waste management which is being covered by an ongoing study assisted by the Japan\nInternationaF cooperation Agency (JICA).", "3\n(vi) environmental sanitation including institutional issues, and low-cost and\ninnovative sanitation options; and integrating the provision of water supply and\nsanitation;\n(vii) strengthening essential local support for development of the sector including a\nreview of human resource development needs; and\n(viii) a medium-term (1999-2004) sector plan and appropriate framework and\npriority program for possible external assistance, and a broad review of the\nlonger-term (1999-2015) water resources needs.'\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n8. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $720,000 equivalent, comprising $400,000 in\nforeign exchange cost and $320,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Bank will finance\n$600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a part of the local currency\ncost equivalent to $200,000. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis from the\nBank-funded TA program. The Government will provide the balance of the local currency cost,\nequivalent to $120,000, for office space and transport, remuneration and per diem of\ncounterpart staff, and communication facilities and administrative support. The details of the\ncost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 3.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n9. The Executing Agency for the TA will be NEDA, which is in charge of national\nresource allocation. The Study will be directed in cooperation with the Bank by a senior official\nappointed as the Study director. The Government will form an interagency steering committee\nfor the Study, to be chaired by NEDA and to include representatives of agencies concerned\nincluding the Department of Finance, Department of Public Works and Highways, Department\nof the Interior and Local Government, National Water Resources Board, Department of Health,\nDepartment of Natural Resources, MWSS, Local Water Utilities Administration, and NGOs.\nThe steering committee will coordinate the Study and be assisted by the formation of working\ngroups to address specific aspects of the Study. The Study will be carried out in close\nconsultation with the Presidential Task Force on Water, to avoid duplication and to ensure\nmore efficient use of inputs. The Study will also be closely coordinated with the work of other\nfunding agencies including the World Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency.\n10. The Study will incorporate the active involvement of the Government and key\nstakeholders from the beginning to ensure that the outcomes will be approved and owned by\nthe Government. The TA is expected to commence in early 1998 and carried out over a period\nof nine months. The participatory approach of the Study will be enhanced by community and\ninterdepartmental consultations through several workshops during its course. The objective will\nbe that the policies, strategy, and the investment priorities outlined in the Study are fully owned\nby the Government are formally adopted in a timely manner. A period of nine months is\nIncluding integrated water resources management and allocation, and the effects of the El Nino\nphenomenon.", "4\nprovided for the implementation of the Study to allow for sufficient time for a comprehensive\nconsultation process, involving the preparation of various issues papers, workshops, and\nagreements on the investment plan. For the duration of the Study, the Government will provide\nsix full-time professional counterpart staff with skills in water resources management and\nsector development planning, including policy formulation and evaluation. Other experts, such\nas hydrologists, water resources engineers, and environmental and social impact assessment\nand economic development specialists, will be made available on an as-needed basis to be\ndecided at the time of TA inception.\n11. To undertake the assignment, a firm of international consultants, in association with\ndomestic consultants, will be engaged by the Bank using the simplified technical proposaL The\nTA will require about 38 person-months (pm) of consulting services, including 14 pm of\ninternational consultants and 24 pm of domestic consultants. The international consultants will\nhave expertise in institutional development (9 pm); water supply engineering (5 pm); sanitary\nengineering (4 pm); and economic/financial analysis (1 pm). The domestic consultants will\nprovide services in institutional development (7 pm), water supply engineering (5 pm), sanitary\nengineering (4 pm), economic analysis (2 pm), financial analysis (3 pm), environmental\nanalysis (2 pm, and community participation development (1 pm).

Following a request from the Government of the Repubhc of the Philippines, a Fact-\nfinding Mission was fielded in May 1997 to formulate technical assistance (TA) 1 for the\npreparation of a Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Plan Study (the Study). The Mission held\ndiscussions with Government officials, including the National Economic and Development\nAuthority (NEDA), the Department of Finance; the Department of Public Works and Highways;\nthe Department of the Interior and Local Government; the Department of Health; the\nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources, the Metropolitan Waterworks and\nSewerage System (MWSS), the Local Water Utilities Administration; the National Water\nResources Board; water districts (WDs); nongovernmerit organizations (NGOs); and local\ngovernment units (LGUs). An understanding was reached on the objective, scope, Cost\nestimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA.\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Water supply and sanitation services in the Philippines are still inadequate. Currently\nabout 70 percent of the population have access to a safe water supply and sanitary latrines.\nSo far, sector development has been hindered by inadequate water resources planning,\ninstitutional constraints, and the lack of financial resources. A national water summit was held\nin October 1996 and led to the enactment of the National Water Crisis Act to improve the\ndelivery of basic water supply services. The Government is planning to increase the popUlation\ncoverage of water supply service to 90 percent by 2000. The NEDA Board Resolution No. 6 of\n1996 shifted sector development responsibilities to the LGUs, most of which have inadequate\ncapabilities in water resources planning, and preparation and implementation of sector\nprojects. In June 1997, a Presidential Water Task Force was formed to address the sector\nissues, including the establishment of a Water Resources Authority for which draft legislation is\nnow being considered by the Congress. In August 1997, the Government successfully\nimplemented the privatization of the MWSS, which has been restructured to assume\nresponsibility as the regulatory body supervising the two private concessionaires.\n3. The need to further strengthen national policy, strategy, and operational frameworks\nfor the development of the water supply and sanitation sector is recognized. Other major\nconstraints are (i) inadequate institutional capabilities of WDs and LGUs in the areas of\nmanagement and operations; and (ii) limited availability of financial resources, caused partly by\npoor cost recovery and inadequate operation and maintenance practices.\n4. Past efforts to develop the water supply and sanitation sector focused mainly on the\nconstruction of physical facilities. The Government is now giving more attention to\nstrengthening sector policy, strategy, operational frameworks, and institutional capabilities.\nSpecific measures will be identified through an in-depth assessment of the implementation\nexperience so far, including private sector participation in the provision of water supply\nfacilities, and an analysis of emerging sector issues and trends. As part of this process, the\ncurrent medium-term plan will also be updated. The Study will provide an important input in the\nformulation of a sector investment plan and help the Government in further strengthening\ncooperation in the development of the sector. A Project Framework is attached as Appendix 1.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB ausiness Opportunities in September 1 96.", "Ill.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n5. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government in preparing a water supply and\nsanitation sector investment plan study, including a program for institutional capacity building\nand a program for possible external assistance. The plan will aim at the improvement of living\nconditions through better access to a safe water supply and sanitation services. The Study will\nprovide Government with a base for planning sector investments, assist the Bank to determine\nits future development role for the sector, and identify the need for institutional strengthening.\nB.\t Scope\n6. The Study focus will be on the preparation of a sector investment plan for the\nmedium term (1 999-2004), while also synthesizing the findings of previous studies. The Study\nwill be nationwide and give particular attention to decentralization initiatives, enhancing private\nsector participation, integrating water supply with sanitation, and enhancing participatory\nprocesses in the design and implementation of both urban and rural water supply and\nsanitation1 projects and programs. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are\nincluded in Appendix 2.\n7. The scope of work under the Study will include the preparation of recommendations\non:\n(i) strengthening sector policy and strategy frameworks, including identifying\nopportunities for enhancing private sector participation and improving the\npublic-private interface and the regulatory framework;\n(ii) strengthening the institutional framework of the sector, including supporting\ndecentralization initiatives involving the LGUs and strengthening coordination\nbetween the WDs and LGUs;\n(iii) sector development programs with an emphasis on the needs of medium and\nsmall towns and countrywide development, and on identifying innovative\napproaches;\n(iv) measures for financial strengthening, including recommendations on financial\nmanagement, cost recovery/cost sharing, and reducing unaccounted for water;\n(v) enhancing the participatory process including community consultations,\nwomen's involvement, and involved Central Government and local and\nprovincial government agencies; and a more focused approach targeting the\npoor and indigenous people, and involving a regional focus including\nMindanao;\nExcluding solid waste management which is being covered by an ongoing study assisted by the Japan\nInternationaF cooperation Agency (JICA).", "3\n(vi) environmental sanitation including institutional issues, and low-cost and\ninnovative sanitation options; and integrating the provision of water supply and\nsanitation;\n(vii) strengthening essential local support for development of the sector including a\nreview of human resource development needs; and\n(viii) a medium-term (1999-2004) sector plan and appropriate framework and\npriority program for possible external assistance, and a broad review of the\nlonger-term (1999-2015) water resources needs.'\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n8. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $720,000 equivalent, comprising $400,000 in\nforeign exchange cost and $320,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Bank will finance\n$600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a part of the local currency\ncost equivalent to $200,000. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis from the\nBank-funded TA program. The Government will provide the balance of the local currency cost,\nequivalent to $120,000, for office space and transport, remuneration and per diem of\ncounterpart staff, and communication facilities and administrative support. The details of the\ncost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 3.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n9. The Executing Agency for the TA will be NEDA, which is in charge of national\nresource allocation. The Study will be directed in cooperation with the Bank by a senior official\nappointed as the Study director. The Government will form an interagency steering committee\nfor the Study, to be chaired by NEDA and to include representatives of agencies concerned\nincluding the Department of Finance, Department of Public Works and Highways, Department\nof the Interior and Local Government, National Water Resources Board, Department of Health,\nDepartment of Natural Resources, MWSS, Local Water Utilities Administration, and NGOs.\nThe steering committee will coordinate the Study and be assisted by the formation of working\ngroups to address specific aspects of the Study. The Study will be carried out in close\nconsultation with the Presidential Task Force on Water, to avoid duplication and to ensure\nmore efficient use of inputs. The Study will also be closely coordinated with the work of other\nfunding agencies including the World Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency.\n10. The Study will incorporate the active involvement of the Government and key\nstakeholders from the beginning to ensure that the outcomes will be approved and owned by\nthe Government. The TA is expected to commence in early 1998 and carried out over a period\nof nine months. The participatory approach of the Study will be enhanced by community and\ninterdepartmental consultations through several workshops during its course. The objective will\nbe that the policies, strategy, and the investment priorities outlined in the Study are fully owned\nby the Government are formally adopted in a timely manner. A period of nine months is\nIncluding integrated water resources management and allocation, and the effects of the El Nino\nphenomenon.", "4\nprovided for the implementation of the Study to allow for sufficient time for a comprehensive\nconsultation process, involving the preparation of various issues papers, workshops, and\nagreements on the investment plan. For the duration of the Study, the Government will provide\nsix full-time professional counterpart staff with skills in water resources management and\nsector development planning, including policy formulation and evaluation. Other experts, such\nas hydrologists, water resources engineers, and environmental and social impact assessment\nand economic development specialists, will be made available on an as-needed basis to be\ndecided at the time of TA inception.\n11. To undertake the assignment, a firm of international consultants, in association with\ndomestic consultants, will be engaged by the Bank using the simplified technical proposaL The\nTA will require about 38 person-months (pm) of consulting services, including 14 pm of\ninternational consultants and 24 pm of domestic consultants.
