The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is finalizing a regional cooperation strategy (RCS)1 \nfor  archipelagic  Southeast  Asia  (aSEA). 2  This  RCS  includes  several  key  subregional \ncooperation  initiatives  that  ADB  has  been  supporting,  including  the  Brunei  Darussalam-\nIndonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area3 (BIMP-EAGA) and the Indonesia-\nMalaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT).4 Both programs focus on connecting outlying \nregions of neighboring countries, providing the opportunity to develop growth centers away from \ntheir respective capitals. These outlying regions are characterized by high levels of poverty \nrelative  to  national  averages  and  are  scattered  over  many  islands,  making  transport  and \ncommunications relatively expensive.  \n \n2.  In 2005, the leaders of BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT requested ADB to increase its support \nfor both programs, which had shown uneven progress. In response, ADB approved regional \ntechnical assistance (RETA)5 to support the development and implementation of road maps to \nenhance the capacity and effectiveness of both subregional programs. The proposed RETA will \npermit ADB to maintain its support for implementing these road maps, focusing on (i) effective \ninstitutional and coordinating mechanisms, (ii) capacity to respond to emerging issues on a \nsubregional level, (iii) leveraging of public resources by private investment, and (iv) promoting \ninformation sharing and dissemination, all within a results-focused framework. The proposed \nRETA will also support new subregional activities identified in the aSEA RCS, and is consistent \nwith  ADB's  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Strategy  (2006\u20132010)  and  the  current \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN) \nSecretariat. The design and monitoring framework for this RETA is in Appendix 1.6 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The aSEA region contains both middle- and high-income countries, with large income \ndisparities between and within them. It generally enjoyed high growth rates until the 1997 Asian \nfinancial crisis; since then, its countries\u2019 economies have showed more moderate growth, with \nGDP growth averaging 5.3% from 2003 to 2006.7 Poverty indicators have improved, although \nthe  record  in  non-income  Millennium  Development  Goals  is  more  mixed,  as  regional  and  \nintra-country disparities are pronounced. aSEA countries all face issues of how to reinvigorate \nand ensure sustainable and inclusive growth, and encouraging higher investment\u2014especially \nby the private sector\u2014is a challenge. The countries have long stressed the importance of \n                                                 \n1  Finalization of the draft aSEA RCS is awaiting discussions with Management, after recent consultations through a \nSenior Officials\u2019 Meeting. \n2  Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore. \n3  The area includes Brunei Darussalam; the provinces of West, Central, South, and East Kalimantan; North, Central, \nSoutheast, and South Sulawesi; Gorontalo; Maluku; North Maluku; West Papua; and Papua in Indonesia; the \nstates of Sabah and Sarawak, and the Federal Territory of Labuan in Malaysia; and the islands of Mindanao and \nPalawan in the Philippines.  \n4  The Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) currently consists of 14 provinces in southern Thailand \n(Chumphon, Krabi, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Narathiwat, Pattani, Phangnga, Phatthalung, Phuket, Ranong, Satun, \nSongkhla, Surat Thani, Trang, and Yala), 8 states of Peninsular Malaysia (Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negeri \nSembilan, Penang, Perak, Perlis, and Selangor), and the island of Sumatera in Indonesia (consisting of 10 \nprovinces: Aceh, Bangka\u2013Belitung, Bengkulu, Jambi, Lampung, Riau, Riau Islands, and South, West, and North \nSumatera). \n5  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Enhancement of Subregional Cooperation in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT. \nManila (TA 6352-REG, for $1 million, approved on 7 November). The RETA is expected to be completed in early \n2008, ahead of the planned implementation schedule. \n6  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 December 2007.  \n7  Source: ADB estimates. \n ", "2   \nregional cooperation, as they helped to establish ASEAN.8 In addition, with the exception of \nSingapore, aSEA countries have been cooperating in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT. \n \n4.  A defining characteristic of the region is its unique geography, which stretches 5,200 \nkilometers from east to west and 3,400 kilometers from north to south. Its archipelagic nature \nemphasizes particular challenges to reducing poverty. The thousands of scattered islands are \nthinly populated, with local businesses facing high\u2014and often uncertain\u2014real transport and \ncommunication costs as well as susceptibility to natural disasters. Urgent social problems, \nincluding  trafficking  in  persons  and  HIV/AIDS,  as  well  as  the  region\u2019s  deteriorating \nenvironmental, marine, and terrestrial resource base, have had disproportionate impacts on its \npoor.  \n \n5.  The aSEA region is a true \u201cneighborhood\u201d9 with many shared problems, and steps \ntoward working together to address them have occurred under the subregional programs. IMT-\nGT, formed in 1993, has a total population of over 65 million, while BIMP-EAGA, which was \nformally launched in 1994 as a key strategy of participating governments to promote the social \nand economic development of their less-developed and more remote territories, has around 58 \nmillion people. Both initiatives are focused on promoting trade, investment, and tourism with an \nemphasis on private sector-led growth, and have contributed to improved air and sea links, \nlowered trade barriers, and promotion of cross-border investment. BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT \nwere  created  when  the  region\u2019s  economies  were  surging  and  leaders  sought  to  extend \neconomic growth to more isolated regions through greater cooperation. However, the 1997 \nAsian financial crisis disrupted early plans and slowed progress in both initiatives. \n \n6.  Regional  cooperation  in  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT  is  not  only  subregional  but  also \nsubnational, linking parts of relatively large, middle-income countries often separated by vast \nbodies of water. The islands comprising BIMP-EAGA are closer to one another than to their \nrespective capitals, implying a potential for trade among themselves or directly with the rest of \nthe world.  \n \n7.  At separate leaders' summits, held alongside the 11th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur \nin  December  2005,  regional  leaders  reaffirmed  their  commitment  to  the  revitalization  of  \nBIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT. ADB was requested to continue its critical role in further developing \nthe institutional capacity for both initiatives, including by giving priority to developing a road map \nfor IMT-GT10 and an approach for quantifying achievements and activities. It is also clear that \nlocal government units (LGUs) must be more involved in subregional cooperation activities,  and \ntheir capacity must be strengthened. In addition, finding new ways to measure the impact of \n(sub-) regional programs as a whole is crucial. \n \n8.  At the 4th BIMP-EAGA Summit and the 3rd IMT-GT Summit, both held in Singapore on \n19  November  2007,11 regional  leaders  unanimously  commended  ADB  for  supporting  both \ninitiatives and requested that ADB continue and increase such support. Specifically for BIMP-\nEAGA,  the  leaders  requested  increased  support  for  private  sector  development,  capacity \n                                                 \n8  Based in Jakarta, the ASEAN Secretariat focuses on the three strategic thrusts: the ASEAN Security Community, \nthe ASEAN Economic Community, and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. ADB support for the Greater \nMekong Subregion, aSEA, BIMP-EAGA, and IMT-GT is closely coordinated with and endorsed by the ASEAN \nSecretariat, with whom ADB has a memorandum of understanding.   \n9  The aSEA region forms a \u201cneighborhood\u201d of countries that share cultural and historical experiences. Different sets \nof issues involve different neighborhoods of countries and regions within the broader neighborhood.  \n10  A road map for BIMP-EAGA was developed in 2005. See: http://www.aseansec.org/18500-b.pdf. The IMT-GT road \nmap,  which  was  approved  in  2007,  is  at:  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/IMT-Roadmap-\nDevelopment/default.asp  \n11  Both summits were attended by a high-level delegation from ADB, led by President Haruhiko Kuroda. \n ", "  3\nbuilding of subregional institutions, and resource mobilization for the implementation of the \nBIMP-EAGA road map.12 For IMT-GT, the leaders requested ADB support for the development \nof economic corridors and noted that in-depth studies were needed, including analysis of the \ntrade and investment climate as well as more detailed transport sector assessments. IMT-GT \nleaders also requested ADB assistance to help mobilize financial and technical resources for \nimplementing prioritized projects identified in the IMT-GT road map. \n \n9.  The draft RCS provides a strategic focus for ADB\u2019s support for regional cooperation \nwithin aSEA, and concentrates on two principal development constraints in which regional \ncooperation  and  integration  can  have  a  positive  impact:  lagging  competitiveness 13 and \nenvironmental degradation. The initial challenge is to facilitate a process for aSEA countries to \ncollaborate in addressing these constraints, without creating undue institutional structures and \nusing existing ones as much as possible. Issues also include the availability of relevant baseline \ninformation, the establishment of an effective results-based monitoring and evaluation (RBME) \nframework,  and  continued  capacity  building  on  a  subregional  basis.  An  RBME  is  being \ndeveloped for BIMP-EAGA, but this must be expanded to cover all of aSEA and to address the \nregion\u2019s  development  constraints.  The  BIMP-EAGA  Facilitation  Center  in  Kota  Kinabalu, \nMalaysia and the new Center for IMT-GT Subregional Cooperation14 in Selangor, Malaysia also \nrequire capacity-building support. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the RETA will be to strengthen regional cooperation in development \nactivities within aSEA. The outcome of the RETA will be to accelerate the implementation of \nroad maps for BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT through region-wide development and to provide for \nRBME.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Management  for  Development  Results.  The  RETA  will  establish  an  appropriate \nbaseline of monitorable indicators for regional cooperation in aSEA, including indicators specific \nto BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT, as well as for the whole region. This will supplement work begun \nunder RETA 6352, which provided for the development of an RBME system for BIMP-EAGA. \nThe need for a project development process (PDP) became apparent during implementation, \nand a draft PDP has been prepared. The proposed RETA will complete this process, and assist \nin developing a similar system for IMT-GT. This will also include an investment and trade survey.  \n \n12.  Capacity  Building  for  Enhanced  Effectiveness.  The  RETA  will  support  capacity-\nbuilding activities for cooperation among governments, working groups, planning groups, and \nsecretariats associated with aSEA. A rapid assessment of BIMP-EAGA\u2019s institutional structures \nand mechanisms has been completed and will be followed by a detailed assessment under the \nmidterm review of the road map.15 A capacity-building strategy and framework for BIMP-EAGA \nis under preparation and expected to be finalized by mid-2008. The RETA will support the \nimplementation  of  that  strategy  during  its  first  year.  The  coordination  and  implementation \n T  h  e    v i e  w  s    e  x p  r e  s  s e  d    h  e r  e i n    a  r e    those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n1m2  Jeominbt eSrtsa,t eBmoeanrtd,  4otfh D BiIrMecPt-oErAsG, MA aSnuamgmeimt, eSnintg, aopr osrtea, f1f,9 a Nnodv memabye br e2 0p0r7e.l iminary in nature.  \n13  The aSEA countries have performed below par compared to East Asian countries in terms of growth rates,  \nproductivity, and moving up the value chain. \n14  The Center for IMT-GT Subregional Cooperation was officially established in late 2007, with 5-year funding from \nthe Government of Malaysia. \n15  A midterm review of the BIMP-EAGA road map is scheduled for 2008 and will be the subject of a separate RETA.  \n ", "4   \ncapacity of the BIMP-EAGA Facilitation Center will be strengthened through a training needs \nassessment and subsequent training for staff. The Center for IMT-GT Subregional Cooperation \nis being established, and the RETA will provide support to ensure its professional management, \nreview  organizational  and  coordination  mechanisms  and  structures,  and  provide  relevant \ntraining programs. All capacity building training will be conducted through regional activities that \nwill benefit all participating countries. \n \n13.  aSEA\u2019s  geographic  structure  dictates  that  LGUs  are  vital  to  promoting  subregional \ncooperation, but their current capacity in this role is limited. Under IMT-GT, the RETA will \nundertake a capacity needs assessment of LGUs, and LGU capacity-building activities will be \nimplemented  in  both  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT  through  regional  workshops.  In  IMT-GT, \nassociated  working  groups  will  be  supported  through  prioritization  and  implementation  of \nprojects, studies, and working group strategies.  \n \n14.  Other  Subregional  Cooperation.  Earlier  reviews  have  identified  potential  for \nsubregional  cooperation  activities  between  Papua,  Indonesia  and  Papua  New  Guinea  and \nbetween West Timor, Indonesia and Timor Leste. ADB's Pacific Department and Southeast Asia \nDepartment will study potential areas for cross-border activities and develop relevant projects \nwith the guidance of the Pacific regional strategy and its operations business plan,16 as well as \nthe RCS. A third area for subregional cooperation is between Riau Islands, Indonesia and \nSingapore. In this case, it is expected that ADB's support will complement assistance provided \nby Singapore and focus on agri-business development, and possibly tourism and fisheries.  \n \n15.  Responsive  and  Informed  Policy  Dialogue.  Regional  cooperation  in  aSEA  is \ndeveloping in a dynamic context, characterized by changes in the global and regional economic, \nfinancial, and trading environments; increased prominence of climate change, energy efficiency, \nand environmental degradation; and evolving global and regional dimensions of security, crime, \ntrafficking, public health, and other social issues. The RETA provides for the engagement of \nexperts who will prepare prompt, policy-oriented advice on emergent issues requiring regional \nresponses. Such requests for assistance can come from any stakeholder under the usual  \nBIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT processes or from two or more governments in aSEA. \n \n16.  Coordination. It is widely recognized by the aSEA governments that the private sector \nmust play a key role in driving economic growth and investing in development throughout the \nregion.  Public-private  partnerships  in  infrastructure  provision  are  necessary  given  many \ncountries\u2019 fiscal constraints and also ensure that infrastructure is efficiently operated. Given the \nlarge income disparities between the countries, there are also opportunities for cross-border \ninvestments  by  governments.  The  RETA  will  facilitate  coordination  among  and  between \ngovernments and between governments and the private sector through seminars, workshops, \nand the engagement of experts in specific areas as required. The RETA will also continue to \nprovide coordination support with other donor agencies active in the region. \n \n17.  Consultation and Information. The aSEA neighborhood shares common issues that \nrequire  common  approaches.  For  such  regional  cooperation  to  be  effective,  various \nstakeholders in the region must work together to share information and draw lessons from these \nshared  problems  and  solutions,  and  the  RETA  will  continue  to  support  this  process.  \nBIMP-EAGA  developed  a  communications  strategy  with  ADB  support,  and  the  RETA  will \nprovide for its implementation. Communication needs for aSEA and IMT-GT will be evaluated, \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2004.

The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $3.8 million, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. The cost estimates and budget are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Coordination  and  Regional  Cooperation  Division,  Southeast  Asia \nRegional Department will be the Executing Agency (EA), responsible for implementing and \nmonitoring the RETA. The EA will (i) provide and/or mobilize financial resources for regional \nprojects,  programs,  and  technical  assistance;  (ii)  create,  consolidate,  and  disseminate \nknowledge and information on aSEA; (iii) help countries and (sub-) regional bodies build their \ninstitutional capacity to manage regional cooperation; and (iv) act as facilitator, catalyst, and \ncoordinator  of  regional  cooperation.  The  EA's  actual  role  will  vary  in  each  subregional \nneighborhood, depending on issues to be addressed. Implementation will be conducted in close \nconsultation  with  the  relevant  ADB  resident  missions,  the  BIMP-EAGA  Facilitation  Center, \nCenter for IMT-GT Subregional Cooperation, and the ASEAN Secretariat.  \n \n20.  The RETA will finance about 260 person-months of consultant services, 99 international \nand 161 national. Consultants will also be engaged for short-term studies. Consultants will be \nhired as individuals and engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time). Consultants\u2019 outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB \nwill be actively involved in the implementation of the RETA, including workshop organization \nand associated staffing. The RETA will be implemented over a period of about 24 months, from \nMarch 2008 to February 2010. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.
