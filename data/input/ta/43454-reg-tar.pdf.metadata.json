INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In 2008, following a comprehensive review of the Operations Evaluation Department of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB),1 the ADB Board of Directors approved increasing the \ndepartment\u2019s  independence  from  ADB  Management.  The  department  was  renamed  the \nIndependent Evaluation Department (IED) effective January 2009. IED streamlined its internal \norganization,  effective  February  2009,  to  (i)  align  with  the  regional  groupings  1  and  2;  \n(ii)  increase  its  focus  on  quality,  knowledge,  and  capacity  building;  and  (iii)  undertake \nadjustments in the staff skills mix.  \n \n2.  IED is continuing with its efforts to ensure that its evaluation program is strategic and \nintegrated.2 It develops its 3-year work program in consultation with the Board of Director\u2019s \nDevelopment Effectiveness Committee (DEC), Management, and operations departments. The \nwork program takes into account issues of relevance to developing member countries (DMCs) \nand ADB\u2019s current institutional priorities. IED's 2009-2011 work program, as endorsed by the \nDEC, was approved by the Board in December 2008.3 IED's 2010-2012 work program, as \nendorsed by the DEC, has been circulated to the Board for approval, on a no-objection basis.4   \n \n3.  ADB's  Strategy  20205  (strategic  agenda,  drivers  of  change,  and  core  areas  of \noperations) and Asian Development Fund (ADF) X, provide a foundation for the IED work \nprogram. The program has three main considerations: (i) aligning with ADB's strategic and \nthematic priorities, and providing input to the formulation of future policies, strategies, and \nprograms of ADB (derived program); (ii) providing real-time feedback during loan processing \nand implementation, and undertaking evaluation capacity building of regional departments and \nDMCs (real-time feedback program); and (iii) contributing to knowledge solutions (knowledge \nprogram). Items (i) and (ii) are directly derived from ADB\u2019s future programs and IED\u2019s regular \ntasks to support ADB operations, while (iii) is both demand (responding to suggestions) and \nsupply driven (IED initiating new ideas). IED will (i) continue to ensure that topics in the work \nprogram are strategically relevant to ADB and its DMCs; (ii) properly sequence evaluations so \nthat those done early in the 3-year period feed into those planned for later years; (iii) increase \nthe number of broad strategic evaluations of policies and themes, sectors, country operations, \nand institutional development issues; (iv) improve the evaluative content of IED annual reports \non portfolio management and evaluation results; (v) prepare and revise evaluation guidelines; \n(vi) strengthen self-evaluation and the validation process of all project or program completion \nreports and country partnership strategy (CPS) completion reports; and (vii) promote knowledge \nmanagement,  including  dissemination  of  findings  and  recommendations  in  accessible  and \nclearly understandable ways.  \n \n4.  The 2009 work program's actual and expected achievements are in Appendix 1. In \naddition to evaluating ADB assistance and operations, IED (i) conducted staff training on project \nand program completion report preparation to strengthen the self-evaluation capacity of regional \ndepartments; (ii) highlighted the need for post-project completion monitoring and sustainability; \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Review of the Independence and Effectiveness of the Operations Evaluation Department. Manila. \n2  IED\u2019s functions are to (i) assess the performance of completed projects and programs; (ii) review and validate the \nself-evaluation  activities  of  the  operations  departments;  (iii) provide  feedback  for  the  design  and  review  of \nstrategies, policies, and operations; (iv) monitor and report on responses of ADB departments and executing \nagencies to evaluation findings and recommendations; (v) build evaluation capacity in the developing member \ncountries;  and  (vi)  harmonize  evaluation  practices  and  share  evaluation  experience  with  other  multilateral \ndevelopment banks through the Evaluation Cooperation Group.  \n3  IED\u2019s work program is available at http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/work_prog.asp  \n4  Board consideration of IED\u2019s work program for 2010\u20132012 is expected on or around 1 December 2009.  \n5  ADB. 2008.

IED's 2010 proposed work program (Appendix 1, Table A1) comprises 40 evaluation \nreports  and  studies.  Some  areas  of  new  or  added  emphasis  in  the  2010  program  are  \n(i)  monitoring  of  outcomes  and  impact  measurement,  (ii)  self-evaluation  and  capacity \ndevelopment, (iii) development of a management action record system to monitor evaluation \nrecommendations, (iv) validation and evaluation of technical assistance (TA), (v) corporate \nevaluation, and (vi) development of the IED strategy 2020.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  Evaluation at ADB has evolved in response to the institution\u2019s changing focus to cover \nthe entire results chain of inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts, and their sustainability. The \nfocus of evaluation studies has shifted from the project to the sector, country, and region. The \nfull mix of lending and nonlending services that make up country assistance programs has \nbecome the dominant preoccupation of broader evaluations (i.e., corporate evaluations, country \nand sector assistance evaluations, thematic evaluations, and impact evaluations), with priority \nattention to relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability. In light of the general capital \nincrease V and ADF X, ADB is placing more emphasis on improving development effectiveness \nand impacts in the future, and on evidence-based independent evaluations. Accordingly, better \nimpact analysis is needed at the macro level in core sectors that represent the current and \nfuture priorities of ADB. Also, evaluation must focus on modalities of assistance that have not \nbeen  evaluated  such  as  the  multitranche  financing  facility,  countercyclical  support,  and \nnonsovereign  operations.  An  immediate  impact  for  IED  will  be  the  increase  in  real-time \nfeedback for loans or grants under process (a later impact will be the increase in project \n(program) completion reports to be validated). New and/or expanded themes, such as TA \nevaluations, impact evaluations, corporate evaluations, and monitoring and evaluation capacity \ndevelopment of regional departments and DMCs, will also result in diversification of the IED \nwork program.  \n \n7.  Since 1997, TA has financed broader evaluations, and promotion and dissemination of \nevaluation products. Broader evaluations, which are multi-activity, multicountry, and multisector \nin nature, are more complex and have benefited from this responsive approach to providing \nconsulting  and  other  services.  ADB\u2019s  internal  administrative  expense  budget  funds  other \ncomponents of IED\u2019s work program, in particular the preparation of traditional project or program \nperformance evaluation reports. This pattern of resource use will continue. An allocation of \nabout $1.7 million for a regional TA project is included in the indicative planning figures for 2009. \nThe selected evaluation studies for 2009 are being undertaken in two phases, through two \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2009.

The  phase  2  TA  for  selected \nevaluation studies for 2009 will provide funding for part of the 2010 IED work program.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the phase 2 TA will be to help ADB as a learning institution in continuously \nimproving the development effectiveness of its operations and policies. The outcome will be the \nformulation and implementation of new CPSs, sector strategies, policies, and operations based \non  timely  and  practical  IED  findings  and  recommendations.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  An evaluation approach paper outlining the scope, methodology, resource requirements, \nand  terms  of  reference  will  be  prepared  for  each  of  the  broad  evaluation  studies  before \nconsultants  are  engaged  and  the  studies  commence.  The  views  of  relevant  ADB  staff, \ngovernment entities, and other stakeholders will be sought and reflected, as appropriate, in the \nfinal version of the study. Each environment approach paper will have a dissemination plan to \nenhance understanding, provide knowledge support, and create learning opportunities.10 The \nrecommendations of the evaluation reports will be monitored through the management action \nrecord system. The following key activities are envisaged.  \n \n10.  Country  assistance  program  evaluation.  Country  assistance  program  evaluations \n(CAPEs) evaluate ADB's country strategy and assistance programs. Analyzing experience over \nthe past decade, these evaluations assess the development impact of ADB assistance on a \nparticular country and generate critical feedback for preparation of CPSs. The preparation of \nCAPEs  for  Bhutan,  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic,  and  Thailand,11  for  example,  will  \n(i) assess and rate ADB\u2019s strategic positioning, institutional performance, value addition and/or \ncontribution to long-term development results, and sector performance; (ii) identify forward-\nlooking lessons and good practices; and (iii) develop directional recommendations for the next \nCPS. The CAPEs will assess the operations of the past decade or more, and assistance not \ncovered by a previous CAPE. The second CAPE for Bhutan will also assess progress in \nimplementing recommendations of the first Bhutan CAPE. The CAPE for Thailand will be the \nfirst for the country. \n \n11.  Sector  assistance  program  evaluation.  Depending  on  country  and  sector \nrequirements, sector and/or thematic assessments will be undertaken early to feed into the main \nprogrammed  CAPE  reports.  Sector  assistance  program  evaluations  appraise  ADB's  sector \nstrategy, policy dialogue, and ongoing and completed projects and TA projects, and ADB's \nperformance within a given sector in one country. They focus on sectors that received the most \nassistance or are key sectors in ADB strategies in a country.  \n \n12.  Impact evaluation of rural electrification in Bhutan. The objective of the study is to \nassess performance of the three completed rural electrification projects, and identify lessons for \nmaximizing  development  effectiveness  of  rural  electrification  interventions.  The  impact \nevaluation aims to (i) quantify the impact of rural electrification assistance on household welfare \nwith  a  focus  on  health,  education,  and  income;  and  (ii)  evaluate  sustainability  of  rural \n                                                 \n9  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 October 2009.  \n10  ADB's existing knowledge products and services will be used for dissemination. \n11  Preparation of the Thailand CAPE, which is included in IED's 2011 work program, will start in 2010.  \n ", "4 \nelectrification  interventions.  The  study  will  include  a  portfolio  review  of  rural  electrification \nfinanced by ADB in its DMCs covering three projects implemented from 1995 to 2006.12 The \nimpact evaluation is expected to provide quantitative estimates of the impact of ADB assistance \non rural electrification using appropriate methods.13 The study will be conducted in two phases: \n(i)  a  comprehensive  review  of  rural  electrification  literature  and  ADB's  rural  electrification \nportfolio; and (ii) field research based on household surveys, focus group discussions, and key \ninformant interviews. The findings from the study will feed into the CAPE for Bhutan. \n \n13.  Special  evaluation  study:  Is  multisector  approach  the  way  to  go  for  urban \ndevelopment? Urban centers or cities in Asia are important centers of economic growth and \nindustrialization, as they attract human, financial, and material resources in one location. Cities \nprovide their residents with trade and business that link domestic producers and international \nmarkets.  At  the  same  time,  rapid  urbanization  poses  major  challenges  because  urban \ninfrastructure, land for housing, environmental quality, and urban management capacities are \npushed to the limit, and severely constrained. During the past decade, many ADB urban sector \nprojects have used the multisector approach. The objective of the special evaluation study \n(SES) is to evaluate and identify lessons from the design and implementation of urban projects \nunder the category of \"multisector,\" by assessing project components in the delivery of urban \nservices,  encompassing  various  subsectors  including  water  supply,  urban  road,  drainage, \nsanitation  and/or  sewerage,  solid  waste  management,  slum  upgrading,  and  livelihood \nimprovement (microcredit).  \n \n14.  Special  evaluation  study:  Independent  review  of  ADB's  financial  partnership \nfacilities. The objective of the SES is to evaluate and identify lessons from the implementation \nof ADB's financial partnership facilities (FPFs) in the areas of water, clean energy, and regional \ncooperation and integration as established under the Financing Partnership Strategy.14 The \nSES will include a desk review of existing documents for the operations of FPFs, interviews with \nthe project department staff and executing agency staff who are applying the funds from the \nFPFs, assessment of appropriateness and efficiency of the FPF governance structure and \nfunctions,  and  on-site  evaluations  for  the  FPFs  with  projects  in  advanced  stages  of \nimplementation.  \n \n15.  Special  evaluation  study:  Transport  sector  assistance  to  Pacific  developing \nmember countries. The objective of the SES is to evaluate and identify lessons from the \nimplementation of transport projects in the Pacific DMCs of the Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, \nKiribati, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, \nand Vanuatu. This involves highlighting factors that led to successful performance as well as \nkey constraining issues. The SES will identify recommendations to improve the program. It will \nconduct a desk review of project performance evaluation reports and project completion reports \nof transport projects in these countries, and a field evaluation of a sample of projects to assess \nsocioeconomic impacts.  \n \n16.  Special evaluation study: ADB support for weakly performing countries. Prior to \nStrategy 2020, the Medium-Term Strategy II15 noted the need for a more flexible approach to \nmeet  the  needs  of  weakly  performing  countries  (WPCs)  in  terms  of  (i)  special  fields  and \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1995.

In May 2007, ADB Management endorsed a framework for guiding, \nplanning, and implementing assistance to WPCs, including the methodology for identifying and \ndefining appropriate interventions.16 The objectives of the SES are to (i) assess the relevance \nand effectiveness of ADB's response to WPCs in the context of (a) the approaches of other \ndevelopment partners; (b) ADB's own core competencies; and (c) the special WPC challenges \nin 2007, and current and/or evolving issues; and (ii) identify lessons from the operationalization \nof ADB assistance to selected WPCs through 2\u20133 specific country-based case studies. \n \n17.  Regional centers for monitoring and evaluation activities. This activity is to provide \nsupport for research and development related to monitoring and evaluation of four regional \ncenters (one each in East Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean).17  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,269,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund (TASF\u2013IV)  for  $1.0  million,  and  TASF\u2013other \nsources for $269,000. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. IED will implement the TA and supervise \nthe preparation of reports for each evaluation study. Based on experience with similar studies, \nabout 31 person-months of international and about 60 person-months of national consulting \nservices will be required. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. Detailed terms of \nreference will be developed in the evaluation approach papers before action is taken to engage \nconsultants. ADB will engage consultants on an individual basis in accordance with Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA \nwill be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook,18 as \namended from time to time. The TA is estimated to start in January 2010 and be completed in \nDecember 2011. Implementation arrangements will be flexible enough to allow changes should \nIED\u2019s work program be altered, including, as needed, responding to priorities under the long-\nterm strategic framework, 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020, footnote 5) and ADF X. ADB will obtain a \nno-objection from the DMC government prior to commencing any activity financed under this TA \nin the territory of the DMC concerned. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,269,000 on a grant basis \nfor Selected Evaluation Studies for 2009, Phase 2, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n16 An ADF paper on a possible WPC approach was first circulated in February 2004 for the ADF IX Donors' Meeting \nfor soliciting donor guidance on WPC's development, financial, and organizational issues; discussions have been \nsustained through ADF X. \n17 Seven donors including ADB's IED, the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the \nInternational Food and Agriculture Development, the Department for International Development of the United \nKingdom, the Swedish International Development Agency, and the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group \nexpressed interest in joining this program. IED's contribution will be used only for monitoring and evaluation-related \nactivities for two of the four regional centers located in ADB's DMCs\u2014one in East Asia and the other in South Asia. \n18 ADB. 2008.

The Independent Evaluation Department's (IED) 2009 work program is designed to meet \nthe twin purposes of (i) accountability for results and (ii) learning for performance improvement. \nThe topics selected for evaluation are of strategic relevance to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and developing member countries (DMCs), and sequenced properly so that findings and \nrecommendations are provided in a timely manner. In addition to the evaluation reports and \nstudies,  IED  comments  on  operations  documents  and  participates  in  management  review \nmeetings. IED\u2019s other activities include (i) publishing and disseminating knowledge products and \nservices, and introducing new ones to increase IED\u2019s outreach and the utilization of its findings; \n(ii) undertaking evaluation capacity development initiatives; and (iii) participating in international \nnetworking.  \n \nB.  Report Completions \n \n2.  Annual evaluation reports are flagship publications of IED. Three annual evaluation \nreports have been circulated and discussed by the Development Effectiveness Committee of \nthe ADB Board of Directors: (i) 2009 Annual Evaluation Review: Role and Direction of Self-\nEvaluation Practices,1 (ii) Annual Report on 2008 Portfolio Performance,2 and (iii) Acting on \nRecommendations in 2008.3 \n \n3.  Higher-level evaluations. IED will have completed 19 evaluations that assess impacts \nand lessons from groups of sector, country, and regional operations; or address institutional \ndevelopment issues, themes, approaches, or policies.  \n \n(i)  Country  assistance  program  evaluations  (CAPEs)  evaluate  ADB's  country \nstrategy and assistance programs. Analyzing experience over a longer period, \nthese  evaluations  assess  the  development  impact  of  ADB  assistance  on  a \nparticular  country  and  generate  critical  feedback  for  preparation  of  country \npartnership  strategies  (CPSs).  IED  completed  four  CAPEs  in  2009:  for \nBangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, and Viet Nam.  \n(ii)  Sector assistance program evaluations are undertaken in countries and sectors \nwhere ADB has a large ongoing portfolio and expected future operations. They \nprovide information for the CAPEs, knowledge products (e.g., sector syntheses \nof findings), and cross-country comparisons in special evaluation studies. Six \nsector assistance program evaluations were completed: one for the Bangladesh \nCAPE; one for the Nepal CAPE; two for the Viet Nam CAPE, and two for the \nCambodia  CAPE:  (a)  Urban  Services  and  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  in \nBangladesh,4 (b) ADB's Agriculture and Natural Resources Sector Operations in \nNepal,5  (c)  ADB  Support  for  the  Transport  Sector  in  Viet  Nam,6  (d)  Urban \nServices and Water Supply and Sanitation Sector in Viet Nam,7 (e) Transport \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. 2009 Annual Evaluation Review: Role and Direction of Self-Evaluation Practices.

By the end of the \nyear, IED will have completed five special evaluation studies: (a) ADB Support \nfor Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Infrastructure; (b) ADB Support to Gender and \nDevelopment,  Phase  1;  (c)  ADB  Technical  Assistance  Support  for  Justice \nReform in DMCs; (d) ADB Support for Public Sector Reforms in the Pacific, and \n(e) ADB's Contribution to Inclusive Development through Assistance for Rural \nRoads. \n(iv)  Impact evaluation. As part of IED\u2019s proposed thrust on impact evaluations, an \nimpact evaluation on Rural Water Supply and Sanitation in Punjab, Pakistan,10 \nwas completed. It aims to (a) quantify the impact of water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) assistance on household welfare with a focus on health, education, and \nemployment; and (b) evaluate the sustainability of WSS interventions. IED plans \nto conduct one impact evaluation in 2010 and two impact evaluations per year \nthereafter. Additionally, IED is working closely with ADB Management to train \nstaff in impact evaluation and start a pilot program in the regional departments to \nmainstream impact evaluation.  \n \n4.  Evaluation information briefs and/or evaluation knowledge brief. IED undertook \nreal-time  evaluation  of  an  ongoing  ADB  project  in  Viet  Nam.11  The  resulting  evaluation \ninformation brief was circulated to the Board of Directors in early 2009. Another evaluation \ninformation brief was prepared and circulated on Lessons from the Asian Development Bank's \nResponses  to  Financial  Crises.12  An  evaluation  knowledge  brief  on  Greenhouse  Gas \nImplications of ADB's Energy Sector Operations was also completed in 2009.13  \n5.  Project  performance  evaluation  reports.  Performance  evaluation  reports  for  10 \nsovereign  and  one  nonsovereign  project  and/or  programs  will  have  been  completed  by \nDecember 2009. \n \n6.  Other  reports.  IED  embarked  on  a  pilot  program  to  validate  project  or  program \nevaluation  reports  from  2007  onward  to  improve  accountability  and  enhance  quality  of \ncompletion reports. About 35 validation reports are expected to be completed this year.  \n \nC.  Feedback and Dissemination of Evaluation Findings (Knowledge Products) \n \n7.
