During the 2002 Country Programming Mission the Government requested for technical \nassistance (TA) to harmonize national operational guidelines for development cooperation1 and to \nsupport its implementation. The TA Fact-Finding Mission (the Mission) reached an understanding \nwith the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and \nconsulting services for the TA. The Mission also held consultations with Government ministries and \nfunding  agencies  concerned  to  coordinate  each  other's  initiatives  in  Cambodia,  particularly \nharmonization of operational procedures.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over the past decade, the development partners of Cambodia have responded to the \nchallenges of capacity gaps in the administrative structures of the Government, especially in the \nimplementing line ministries where the programs and projects are being implemented by providing \nsupport for building capacity of these institutions.  However,  uncoordinated capacity building efforts \nare proliferating.  In recent years, the G-7 countries, the multilateral development banks, and the \nDevelopment  Assistance  Committee  of  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment have expressed increasing concern about high transaction costs, fragmentation of \nadministrative capacity, and reduction in aid effectiveness caused by the multiplicity of funding \nagencies' operational policies, procedures, and practices. As a result, these institutions and groups \nhave taken steps to foster harmonization both among  external agencies and between them and \nrecipient countries.2 \n \n3.  The growing cooperation between the Government and its development partners has also \nbrought into focus the need for harmonization of operational policies, practices, strategies and \nprocedures  of  external  funding    agencies  in  Cambodia.3  The  participatory preparation of the \nnational poverty reduction strategy  and  the  efforts  being  made  to  harmonize  the  process  for \npreparation of the country strategy for Cambodia by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), United \nKingdom's  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  and  World  Bank  (WB)  clearly \ndemonstrate  the  increasing  momentum  towards  further  collaboration  of  donor  programs  and \nsynergies of project designs.  \n \n4.  The need to harmonize the systems and procedures between the Government, ADB and  \nWB emerged during the 2001 joint Country Portfolio Review Mission . The Government strongly \nsupports  harmonization4  of  the  systems  and  procedures  currently  being  used  in  its  aid \nmanagement, as it is central to improving its portfolio management. In this context, the Government \nestablished the  Government-Donor Partnership Working Group5 in December 2002 under the \nconsultative group mechanism to address issues and make recommendations on appropriate \napproaches  for  building  meaningful  and  effective  development  partnerships  with  its  external \npartners. The ADB-Cambodia Resident Mission (CARM) represents  ADB in this working group. \nThe  Government  is  convinced  that  additional  benefits  (reduced  transaction  costs,  improved \n                                                 \n1  The project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 August 2003. \n2  The harmonization progress in the Philippines  and Viet Nam started in 2002. \n3  Disbursements of Official Development Assistance  to Cambodia increased from $250 million in 1992 to $500 million in \n2002. \n4  Cambodia was a signatory to Rome Declaration on Harmonization in Italy on 25 February 2003. \n5  The Government is the chair of the working group, with Japan and United Nations Development Programme as co-vice-\nchairs, followed by ADB, Australia, Canada, Denmark, DFID, European Commission, France, Germany, Sweden,  and \nWB as members.  \n ", "2    \n \n \nadministrative capacity, and increased aid effectiveness) will be generated over time as partners \nwork together in harmonizing the systems and procedures being applied.   \n \n5.  ADB's earlier TA for capacity building in project accounting6 and external aid management7 \nhas yielded positive results. The TAs developed the project accounting manual (PAM), clarifying the \ndisbursement and project accounting procedures of the Government and  ADB. The Government \nsubsequently  adopted  the  PAM  as  an  official  document  and  required  all  line  ministries  and \nexecuting agencies to follow the manual during project implementation, thus eliminating the need \nfor  developing    procedures  for  each  project.  To  assist  the  Government  in    improving  the \nmanagement of and implementation of externally assisted projects, ADB approved a TA8 in 1999. \nThe TA focused on loan projects assisted by ADB,  Japan Bank for International Cooperation  and \nWB. Under the TA, Government officials were familiarized with funding agencies' operating policies, \nand  exposed  to  more  advanced  and  efficient  external  aid  portfolio  management  systems.  In \naddition to training, the TA improved the organization structure within Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (MEF), updated the PAM, and drafted the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for \nproject implementation. \n \n6.  ADB and WB9 in recognizing the need to harmonize each other's procedures agreed during \nthe joint 2002 CPRM with the Government to harmonize the (i) SOPs, (ii) PAM for decentralized \nproject  financial  management,  (iii)  national  competitive  bidding  documents,  and  (iv) reporting \nrequirements. The draft SOP prepared under ADB-assisted TA CAM: 3287  (footnote 8)  is now \nbeing harmonized with WB assistance for use by WB-financed projects. WB is also assisting the \nsimplification  and harmonization of the PAM for use by WB assisted projects. The revised PAM, \ncalled the Financial Management Manual, includes reporting and auditing requirements in addition \nto financial management. The two draft documents will be discussed with the Government in \nFebruary 2004. Following the Government's review,  the documents will be updated to reflect the \nGovernment's  comments  and  the  Government  will  issue  a  decree  to  adopt  them  as  official \nprocedures to be adhered to by all line ministries for implementation of loan-financed projects. \n \n7.  The  TA is in line with   ADB's strategy to help achieve the Government's objectives of \nharmonizing implementation strategies among development partners, thus contributing to increased \neffectiveness  of  official  development  assistance  resources,  sharper  focus  of  development \ncooperation on human development, poverty reduction, and decentralization. The TA will maintain \nthe momentum gained and continue the healthy status of project implementation. The TA will also \ncomplement the harmonizing efforts of the Government-Donor Partnership Working Group and \nbuild capacity within MEF to better manage the implementation of both domestically and externally \nfinanced projects. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1996.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The main objective of the TA is to assist the Government in developing harmonized project \nimplementing  guidelines  and  implementing  them  for  externally  assisted  loan  projects.  The \nguidelines  developed  will  take  account  of  Government  policies  and  procedures,  and  embody \ninternational standards and best practices, adapted  to the realities of local conditions. This initiative \nwill contribute to the Government's efforts  to establish a harmonized approach to implementation of \nall development activities regardless of  source of loan funds. The logical framework for the TA is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The    TA  will  have  five  components:  (i)  developing  a  decentralized  project  financial \nmanagement manual based on the revised PAM;  (ii)  implementing the decentralized project \nfinancial management manual through training of provincial and communes staff in its use; (iii) \nimplementing the SOPs in line ministries; (iv) developing  harmonized national competitive bidding \n(NCB) documents for national and decentralized procurement; and (v) harmonizing MEF project \nmonitoring systems of ongoing civil works contracts and consultants,  and building MEF's capacity,  \nincluding  project  management  units (PMUs) and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  of  line \nministries in contract management. \n \n10.  Component  1:  Decentralized  Project  Financial  Management.  This  component  will \ninclude reviewing the current decentralized structure in project financial management and proposing \na harmonized structure for decentralized project financial management. The component will  (i) \nreview the current practices of different  funding agencies (including SEILA10); and (ii)  draft an \nappropriate  model  for  decentralized  project  financial  management  (including  implementing \nprocedures and guidelines), which will be prepared by consultants and finalized by the MEF \nworking group under the TA steering committee after holding stakeholder workshops. \n \n11.  Component 2: Strengthening Project Financial Management . This component will follow \nafter the Government adopts the draft decentralized project financial management model. Upon the \nadoption, the consultant will draft the handbook and prepare training materials to training about 600 \nparticipants from provincial departments of MEF, PMUs, PIUs and communes where externally \nfinanced projects are being delegated. The component will  include training of trainers , which will \nbe provided  especially for resource staff at the central and provincial levels who can later transfer \ntheir knowledge and skill to operating staff at commune levels.  \n \n12.  Component 3: Implementing the Standard Operating Procedures. This component will \n(i) support training of about 200 participants from PMUs and PIUs of externally financed projects, \nand (ii)  will  include developing training materials and training programs, and  training of PMU and \nPIU staff. Emphasis will be on training of trainers, which will be provided to resource staff at the \ncentral and provincial levels. \n \n13.  Component 4: Harmonized National Competitive Bidding Documents. This component \nwill compare existing Government's NCB documents with those of ADB, WB, and other loan funding \nagencies  and  prepare  a  harmonized  NCB  document  for  externally  financed  projects  for \n                                                 \n10  Means Stone or Foundation in the Khmer language. It is an aid mobilization and coordination framework for support to \nthe Government's decentralization and deconcentration reforms. \n ", "4    \n \n \nprocurement of goods and civil works. The component will also review  bid documents used for \nsmall civil works and procurements of goods at provincial levels where bids packages vary between \n$10,000 and$30,000, with a view to standardizing them for use by decentralized external financed \nprojects. Once finalized, Government will inform all line ministries to use the harmonized documents \nby external financed projects. The CARM will post the document on its web site and they will be \nposted on the related government agency web sites for easy access by   PMUs, line ministries,  \ncontractors, suppliers and the general public.  \n \n14.  Component  5:  Measures  To  Harmonize  Loan  Project  Monitoring  System.  This \ncomponent will review  the current practice of project monitoring in terms of ongoing civil works \ncontracts, procurement of goods, contract awards, and disbursements of external financed projects, \nincluding measures to improve current practices. The component will include training to address \ncurrent  weakness  of  PMUs  and  PIUs  in  contract  management.  A  review  of  the  contract \nmanagement  practices  will  be  made,  and  guidelines  for  contract  management  including  best \npractices will be prepared for circulation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $715,000 equivalent, of which $415,000 equivalent is \nthe foreign exchange cost and $300,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $415,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$185,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis, from the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the balance \nof the local currency equivalent  to  $115,000  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, and secretarial and office support services. The detailed cost estimates and \nproposed financing arrangements are given in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MEF will be the Executing Agency. All  the TA activities will be implemented through the \nMEF Department of International Cooperation (DIC), with the  director of DIC as TA   director to \nsupervise the day-to-day activities of the TA. A TA steering committee will be established for overall \nsupervision and coordination of the TA, with the secretary general of MEF as chairman and the \ndirector of DIC as secretary. Under the steering committee, there will be a working group that will \ncoordinate  with  consultants  in  implementing  the  TA  activities.  The  members  of  the  steering \ncommittee  and  the  working  group  will  comprise  officials  from  DIC,  Treasury,  Local  Finance \nDepartment (in charge of deconcentration and decentralized budget), Department of Procurement \nunder MEF and Council for Development of Cambodia (chair of the Government-Donor Working \nGroup on Harmonization). To facilitate smooth TA implementation and  coordination between the \nGovernment  and  ADB,  the  steering committee will meet on a quarterly basis to monitor the \nprogress of the TA and  ensure that its objectives are achieved. CARM, the WB resident mission \nand other loan funding agencies will be invited to participate in all such meetings. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  16  months,  to  commence  in  May  2004  and  to  be \ncompleted by September 2005. The TA will require three international (18 person-months total) and \nfour domestic (38 person-months total) consultants. For the international consultants,  6 person-\nmonths of consulting services will be  provided by a financial management specialist,  6 person-\nmonths by a project management specialist, and 6 person-months by a procurement specialist with \ncontract management skills. The domestic consultants will include 8 person months of consultant \nservices  of  a  project  management  specialist,  16  person-months  by  a  financial  management \nspecialist, 8 person-months by a procurement specialist and  6 person-months by a database ", "  5\nmanagement specialist. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are given in Appendix 3. \nThe consultants will be recruited on an individual basis, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants, and with the assistance of CARM. All procurement will be undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1 will take about 4 months; phase 2, 4 \nmonths; and phase 3, 8 months. During phase 1, the project management specialist will review the \nrevised SOP and draw up a training program. The procurement specialist will review the current \nnational procurement documents, including bid documents used for small contracts for procurement \nof goods and civil works by donors and draft harmonized procurement documents. At the same \ntime, this consultant will  assess the weaknesses of contract management within PMUs and PIUs, \nand draw up guidelines including best practices. The financial management specialist will review \nthe revised PAM; assess current systems of project financial management at the provincial and \ncommune  levels;  identify  weaknesses  of  the  current  systems;  and  draft  sample  models  for \ndecentralized project financial management by major sectors, implementing guidelines for the \nrevised systems, and a master plan for the training program. The drafts will be submitted to the \nGovernment and ADB for review and comments.  \n \n19.  The period between phases 1 and 2 is to enable the Government,  ADB, and WB to \nthoroughly review and discuss proposed decentralized financial management models, sample NCB \ndocuments, contract management practices, and training programs for SOPs. During phase 2, the \nconsultants will incorporate comments from the Government and ADB, and finalize all required \ndocuments for the  Government's official approval through decisions or decrees or orders for a \nnationwide  application.  Training  materials  reflecting  the  newly  approved  systems  will  also  be \nproduced in phase 2 of the TA. The international consultants will train trainers in phase 3 to enable \nthem  to conduct  short national training courses and complete all planned national training courses \nwithin this phase. The tentative implementation schedule is in Appendix 4.  \n \n20.  The consultants will prepare and submit the following reports in English to MEF and ADB: (i) \nan inception report after 1 month of fieldwork; (ii) draft and final handbook, implementing guidelines, \nmodels of decentralized project financial management, contract management  plan, and training \nplan and training materials; (iii) interim progress reports at the end of phases 1 and 2; and (iv) draft \nand final completion reports upon completion of the TA, covering the implementation and impact of \nthe  new  decentralized  project  financial  management  and  decentralized  procurement,  and \npostevaluation of training programs.  MEF will prepare and submit quarterly progress reports to \nADB. ADB will conduct inception and review missions in each phase of the TA to participate in  \nmeetings (Government, consultants, ADB, WB and other loan financing institutions), and  review \nthe progress of the TA.  \n \n \nIV.
