THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the additional financing of the Water Resources Management in \nthe Pyanj River Basin Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant \nto be provided by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for the additional financing of the Water \nResources Management in the Pyanj River Basin Project, and if the Board approves the proposed \ngrant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of \nthe grant. \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will expand the scope of the current project to include \ncapacity building and institutional development of the State Agency for Hydrometeorology of \nTajikistan  (Hydromet)  to  provide  quality  climate  services  for  water  resources  management \n(WRM), agricultural production, and disaster risk reduction in the Pyanj River Basin (PRB) in \nsouthern Tajikistan.1 The project will address Hydromet\u2019s key underlying institutional weaknesses \nand support its development to a sustainable and well-resourced national agency for meteorology \nand hydrology. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale  \n \n3.  Tajikistan is one of the most vulnerable countries in Central Asia to the adverse impacts \nof climate change, with the water resources and agriculture sectors most affected.2 Over 70% of \nthe population lives in rural areas, mostly relying on agriculture production for their livelihoods.3 \nAmong these, the poor are generally most exposed to prevailing climatic conditions and natural \nhazards. In the period 1990\u20132016, the country experienced approximately 45 significant climate-\nrelated natural disasters, of which 60% were floods. These disasters caused about 500 deaths \nand $1.5 billion in damages.4 Future climatic changes are expected to exacerbate such events \nand generate additional negative impacts. Annual and winter mean temperatures in Tajikistan are \nexpected to increase by up to 2 degrees Celsius by 2050 from the 1971\u20132000 baseline.5 \nIncreased  temperatures  and  evapotranspiration  may  increase  irrigation  water  demand  and \ndecrease agricultural yields (footnote 3). Accelerated glacier retreat may increase monthly river \nflow rates in the medium term, followed by declines in the longer term. Flood events may increase \nin magnitude and frequency.6 \n \n4.  The Government of Tajikistan has recognized climate change as a key risk to its future \ndevelopment  and  has prioritized  improving  resilience  and  adapting  to  its  adverse  impacts. \nTajikistan\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change prioritizes reducing the country\u2019s vulnerability to \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

", "2 \nclimate change in key areas\u2014agriculture, irrigation, and water resources\u2014through the adoption \nof new methods and planning and improved hydrometeorological monitoring, among others.7 \nThese  priorities  are  also  reflected  in  the  forthcoming  Tajikistan  National  Climate  Change \nAdaptation Strategy8 and the National Development Strategy to 2030.9  \n \n5.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  disaster  and  climate  change \nresilience in water resources and agriculture in Tajikistan since 2006, with a focus on the PRB. \nThe PRB is the Tajikistan\u2019s largest river basin. It is economically vital to the country as it includes \nthe  majority  of  Khatlon  province,  which  is  the  country\u2019s  most  populated  and  agriculturally \nproductive province. However, districts in the PRB are among the poorest in the country and most \nexposed and vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.10 The Khatlon Province Flood \nRisk Management Project, completed in 2014, and the ongoing Building Climate Resilience in the \nPyanj River Basin Project have supported disaster and climate resilience in water resources and \nagriculture through investments in infrastructure for the most vulnerable districts and capacity \nbuilding on community disaster preparedness.11 \n \n6.  The current project continues ADB\u2019s support in the PRB by improving the government\u2019s \nWRM capacity and increasing agricultural productivity and water use efficiency in irrigated \nagriculture (footnote 1). The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MEWR) and the Agency \nfor Land Reclamation and Irrigation (ALRI) are the project executing agencies.12 Under the \nMEWR-led component, the project will establish river basin organizations and strengthen their \ncapacity for river basin management, including improved monitoring of water use for irrigation. \nThe project will also support Tajikistan\u2019s contribution to joint management of the PRB through a \njoint Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan Pyanj River Basin commission.13 Under the ALRI-led component, the \nChubek Irrigation System will be modernized and climate-proofed, including the irrigation and \ndrainage infrastructure and pumping stations. The project will also support capacity building of \nfarmers and water user associations on water use efficiency and agricultural productivity. \n \n7.  Timely and accurate reporting, forecasting, and warning of weather, hydrometeorological, \nand climatic conditions are critical inputs to effective WRM, agricultural production, and disaster \nrisk reduction. ALRI and MEWR\u2019s operations rely on the provision of these inputs by the national \nforecasting entity, Hydromet. The importance of such services will grow under future climatic \nchanges. Market research has revealed interest and willingness to pay among key stakeholders \nfor a broad array of new specialized information services from Hydromet. However, Hydromet is \nhindered  by  many  of  the  weaknesses  of  post-Soviet  institutions,  including  limited  budget, \ndecaying infrastructure, and poor staff retention. Consequently, it has insufficient capacity to \nprovide quality services. Its monitoring network is sparse, it has limited forecasting and warning \ncapabilities, and limited resources to improve or develop new outputs to meet users\u2019 needs.  \n                                                \n7 Government of Tajikistan. 2015.

Manila. (G0506-AFG) \n ", "3 \n \n8.  Strengthening  the  institutional  and  technical  capacity  of  Hydromet  is  critical  to  the \ncountry\u2019s climate resilience and adaptation efforts. Several externally supported projects have \nsought to improve Hydromet\u2019s capacity in data collection, analysis, and forecasting through \ninvestments  in  training  and  equipment.  The  ongoing  World  Bank  Central  Asia  Hydromet \nModernization  Project  has  invested  in  the  monitoring  network  and  short-term  weather \nforecasting.14 ADB technical assistance for Building Capacity for Climate Resilience is investing \nin  long-term  climate  change  modeling.15 However,  Hydromet  still  has  limited  capacity  for \nhydrometeorological monitoring, hydrological modelling, and flood forecasting. In addition, no \nexternally financed projects to date have focused on Hydromet\u2019s key underlying institutional \nweaknesses, which are the source of its problems. Unless these weaknesses are addressed, the \nsustainability and effectiveness of any capacity-building interventions are likely to be low. \n \n9.  The additional financing is needed to expand the scope of the current project to include \ncapacity building and institutional development of Hydromet. The report and recommendation of \nthe  President  of  the  current  project  raised  the  prospect  of  additional  financing  for \nhydrometeorological  monitoring  and  forecasting  (footnote  1).  By  improving  the  quality  of \nHydromet\u2019s services to ALRI, MEWR, and other key stakeholders in the PRB, the additional \nfinancing will directly support and enhance the outputs of the current project. Improved information \ndelivery, forecasting, and warning by Hydromet will (i) support efficient WRM and agricultural \nproductivity  among  river  basin  organizations,  water  user  organizations,  and  farmers;  and \n(ii) reduce  disaster  impacts  to  settlements,  water  resources  infrastructure,  and  irrigation \ninfrastructure.16 Engagement between Hydromet and its key users will be strengthened, thereby \nimproving the relevance and utility of its services.  \n \n10.  Following approval by the ADB Board of Directors on 28 September 2016, the current \nproject was made effective on 8 August 2017 and is performing well based on the following \nassessment:17 \n(i)  Delivery of expected outputs. The current project is on track to meet its intended \noutputs: (a) water resources in the PRB better managed; (b) modernized and \nclimate-proofed Chubek Irrigation System WRM infrastructure fully operational; \nand (c) farm management capacity and water use skill improved. \n(ii)  Implementation progress. Following delayed project effectiveness caused by \nslower than expected internal government approvals, the project is now back on \nschedule. As of April 2018, cumulative contract awards were $3.2 million (12% of \ntotal) and disbursement was $1.1 million (4% of total) against 15% elapsed time. \nThree project implementation consultant (PIC) teams, one for each output, have \nbeen recruited and mobilized as of November 2017. Bidding for the major civil \nworks and supply contracts will commence in the second quarter of 2018, with \ncontract award targeted in the fourth quarter of 2018. The project closing date is \n30 June 2022.  \n(iii)  Safeguard compliance. The current project is category B for environment and C \nfor involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. No significant adverse social \nor  environmental  impacts  are  expected  as  physical  activities  are  primarily \nconducted  on  existing  irrigation  systems.  The  project  complies  with  ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n14 World Bank. 2011. Central Asia Hydromet Modernization Project. Project appraisal document.

To date, no physical works have started, \nand safeguard implementation is on track with no outstanding corrective actions. \n(iv)  Management of risks. The project has measures to manage risks. The project \nimplementation groups (PIGs) of ALRI and MEWR implement the project activities. \nThe  PICs,  led  by  international  specialists,  support  the  PIGs  in  project \nimplementation, including managing technical, financial, and procurement risks. \n(v)  Project performance rating. The current project performance rating has been on \ntrack since effectiveness to date.18 \n \n11.  Overall,  the  project  is  eligible  for  additional  financing.  The  current  project  remains \ntechnically feasible and is expected to be economically viable and financially sound. Investments \nin the climate resilience of WRM are a high government priority, in line with climate change \nadaptation and national development strategies. The current project and proposed additional \nfinancing are consistent with the current country partnership strategy.19 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impacts of the overall project will be (i) irrigated land in good condition and food \nsecurity  increased  (unchanged), 20  (ii)  the  efficiency  of  water  resource  use  increased \n(unchanged),21 and (iii) climate resilience of agriculture and WRM improved (added).22 The \noutcome of the overall project will be agricultural productivity and relevance of forecasting \nservices increased in the PRB (changed).23 \n  \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The additional financing will expand the scope of the current project output 1 and 3 as \nfollows. The additional financing will not directly contribute to output 2 (Appendix 1). \n \na.   Output  1:  Water  Resources  in  Pyanj  River  Basin  Better  Managed \n(unchanged) \n \n14.  Improve forecasting and warning of extreme weather events. The project will build \nHydromet\u2019s capacity for flood forecasting and warning in the PRB area. It will install monitoring \ndevices (e.g., river gauges and weather stations) and warning systems, and develop a flood \nforecasting model for selected pilot areas. Target communities will be consulted and trained in \nthe flood warnings and disaster preparedness. Hydromet staff will be trained in the operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the flood forecasting and warning systems. \n \n15.  Modernize Hydromet\u2019s operations center. The project will relocate Hydromet\u2019s central \noperations in Dushanbe from its current dilapidated campus to a new compound in the capital \npreviously allocated to Hydromet. The project will complete the half-finished office building in the \ncompound and install a core information technology system for processing, networking, and data \nstorage. The project will also construct adjacent ancillary buildings including a warehouse, \n                                                \n18 The project was erroneously rated potential problem in eOps in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of a system error. \n19 ADB. 2016.

Two \nmixed-use buildings will be constructed on the compound to provide affordable housing for core \nHydromet employees, to ensure staff can remain nearby during critical weather events, and to \nprovide an in-kind salary benefit. \n \n16.  Legal and organizational transformation of Hydromet. The legal status of Hydromet \nwill be updated to that of a state entity with increased management and financial autonomy. \nHydromet will remain a public service entity, primarily funded by the government budget, providing \nforecasts and public information (including critical alerts) free of charge. However, the legal \nchange will allow Hydromet to seek, retain, and use additional commercial revenue to supplement \nits government budgetary support. Additional revenue sources are expected to include (i) the sale \nof specialty fee-based information products such as data, and customized forecasts and alerts; \n(ii) rental  of  facilities  such  as  office  and  conference  space  on  commercial  terms;  and \n(iii) consulting and other technical advisory services. The project will provide capacity building to \nHydromet staff on strategy, management, administration, and control in line with its updated legal \nframework. The project will develop a strategic O&M plan, including annually updated budget \nforecasts. The project will support knowledge sharing events between Hydromet with other \nnational hydrometeorological (or related) agencies in the region. \n \nb.

The project will support the provision of additional \nspecialty fee-based information products to supplement Hydromet\u2019s free-of-charge core public \nservice outputs. Such products may include historical datasets, focused daily or weekly forecasts, \nand  location-  or  sector-specific  weather  alerts,  on  a  one-time  or  subscription  basis.  Such \ninformation services could offer significant value to clients\u2019 planning and O&M decisions, e.g., \nirrigation, planting, and harvesting scheduling by farmers. Pricing will be tailored to the target \nmarket, taking into account affordability. An information technology platform will be developed to \nallow the provision of such services through widely available communication media such as email, \nweb, short messaging service, and apps. The project will support the development of a marketing \nstrategy  and  implementation  plan,  including  pricing  schedule  and  product  development. \nInformation products will be developed through consultation with key stakeholders, farmers, and \ncommunities in the PRB, and made available through the platform. Hydromet staff will be trained \nin the O&M of the subscription platform and product development. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.

[ii]) of ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n ", "7 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  Hydromet will be added as a third executing agency under the project, responsible for \nimplementing the additional financing activities.25 A new PIG will be established within Hydromet \nto execute the additional financing. A PIC led by an international team leader will be recruited to \nsupport project implementation. To expedite project readiness, Hydromet will aim to issue the \nrequests  for  proposals  to  the  consulting  firms  before  Board  approval.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration \nmanual.26 For the additional financing project, universal procurement will apply, as ADB and \nGCF\u2019s resources will jointly finance individual procurement packages. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements for Additional Financing \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2018\u2013June 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2023 \nEstimated grant closing date  31 December 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee \nDeputy prime minister (chair) \nDirector of the ALRI; chairs of the Committee on Environmental \nProtection, Committee for State Investment and State Property \nManagement, and Committee for Women and Family Affairs; deputy \nministers of the ministries of agriculture, economic development and \ntrade, energy and water resources, foreign affairs, and finance \n(members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Hydromet \n(iii) Implementation unit  Dushanbe, expected 13 Hydromet PIG staff \nProcurement  International  3 contracts  $4.8 million \ncompetitive bidding  (estimate) \nNational competitive  5 contracts  $2.0 million \nbidding  (estimate) \nShopping  Multiple contracts  $0.25 million \n(estimate) \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- 44 person-months  $1.9 milliona \nbased selection  international  (estimate) \n(90:10)  158 person-months \nnational (estimate) \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advanced contracting will be used to recruit the project \nadvance contracting  implementation consultant. \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ALRI = Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation, Hydromet = State Agency for \nHydrometeorology of Tajikistan, PIG = project implementation group. \nNote: Cost estimates exclude government contributions in the form of exemptions to taxes and duties. \na Includes travel, workshops, studies, surveys and design, office administration and equipment, and contingencies. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                \n25 The executing agencies for the current project are MEWR (output 1) and ALRI (output 2 and 3). \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The project was designed with a view to establish a sustainable and viable national \ninstitution, based on detailed studies on Hydromet\u2019s organizational and technical capacity and \nlegal  structure.  The  planned  legal  and  organizational  transformations,  along  with  the \nmodernization of the operations center, will help overcome key institutional weaknesses and \nbarriers. This will provide a solid foundation upon which Hydromet may develop technical capacity \nfor monitoring, forecasting, and informing the public. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The economic assessment confirmed the economic viability of the additional financing \nproject. The calculated economic internal rate of return is 11% and the economic net present \nvalue is $6.5 million at the discount rate of 6% for disaster risk reduction investments.27 The \nproject- quantified benefits are incremental avoided future impacts of flooding in the PRB area, \narising from a strengthened Hydromet providing improved services. The economic results are \nrobust to alternative cost and benefit scenarios. Nonquantifiable benefits include increased \nagricultural productivity and avoidance of damage, displacement, and deaths from climate-related \ndisasters. \n \n23.  The project is also expected to provide significant financial benefits to Hydromet and \ncontribute to its long-term viability. As with other national meteorological agencies, it is envisaged \nthat Hydromet will remain funded primarily through the government budget during and after the \nproject because of its public service mandate. The project will help Hydromet secure additional \ncommercial revenues to support increased investment and O&M expenditures for improved \nsustainability. These revenues are expected to contribute about 10% of Hydromet\u2019s annual \nbudget by project completion and 15% by 2030. In addition, effective annual salary packages for \nkey Hydromet staff are expected to more than double by 2025 against the without-project case, \nas a result of improved funding from commercial revenues and housing benefits, and thereby help \nHydromet attract and retain highly skilled staff. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Hydromet.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 26). \n \n25.  The financial  management  assessment  of  Hydromet  concluded that  it  represents  a \nsubstantial risk because of less effective internal controls, accounting and financial reporting, and \nfunds  flow.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design,  including \n(i) recruiting experienced and qualified staff for the PIG; (ii) providing financial management \nsupport and training under the PIC; and (iii) providing training in ADB procedures related to audit, \ndisbursement, and project management. \n \n26.  The procurement capacity assessment concluded that Hydromet represents a substantial \nrisk because of (i) lack of qualified procurement staff; (ii) lack of experience and unfamiliarity with \ncompetitive procurement processes consistent with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \n                                                \n27 ADB. 2017. Business Processes for Economic Analysis of Projects. Compendium of Staff Instructions. Manila. \n ", "9 \namended from time to time); (iii) insufficiently centralized record keeping; and (iv) inadequate \nintegrity and anticorruption measures in place. Mitigation measures have been incorporated into \nthe project design, including (i) recruiting experienced and qualified staff for the PIG; (ii) providing \nprocurement support and training under the PIC; (iii) providing training in ADB procurement \nprocedures, including ADB standard bidding documents; and (iv) use of prior review procedures. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  Poverty. The poorest households in the PRB are generally the most vulnerable to the \nimpacts of climate change. The project will improve the provision of climate services and warnings \nto stakeholder agencies, community groups, and individuals, including on damaging flood events \nin  the  PRB.  Improved  provision  of  information  products  marketed  at  farmers  and  local \ncommunities  will  support  decision  making  in  agriculture, WRM,  and  other  climate-sensitive \nactivities, thereby improving the livelihoods and income of the poor. \n \n28.  Social and gender. The additional financing project is categorized effective gender \nmainstreaming. The project will ensure consultations, training, and awareness campaigns for \nflood forecasting and fee-based information services are gender-sensitive, with significant female \nrepresentation.  The  project  will  narrow  gender  gaps  in  Hydromet  by  increasing  female \nrepresentation in key positions and providing training in management, administration, and control. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s SPS, the project\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows. \n \n30.  Environment (category B). The project\u2019s residual adverse impacts are not expected to \nbe  significant,  after  the  implementation  of  feasible  environmental  management  measures. \nExpected  construction-phase  impacts  are  not  significant  or  complex.  The  draft  initial \nenvironmental examination was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website, following receipt of Hydromet\u2019s \nconcurrence, in January 2018.28 The Hydromet PIG will submit semiannual safeguard monitoring \nreports to ADB and establish and implement the grievance redress mechanism described in the \ninitial environmental examination. \n  \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No involuntary acquisition of land or involuntary \nrestrictions on land use are expected, according to the SPS definition. The Hydromet PIG and \nPIC will confirm this during implementation. If any additional land requirements or involuntary \nresettlement impacts are identified, a resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSPS and approved by ADB before any related civil works contract is awarded. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples are present in the project \narea, according to the SPS definition. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n                                                \n28 Government of Tajikistan, Agency for Hydrometeorology Committee of Environment Protection. 2017.
