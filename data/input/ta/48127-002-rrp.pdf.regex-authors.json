THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the \nSecond Strengthening Higher Education Project.1  \n2.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  links  between  higher  education  services  and \nsocioeconomic  needs  by  improving  higher  education  quality,  enhancing  access  to  modern \nhigher  education  programs,  and  strengthening  governance  and  management  of  higher \neducation institutions (HEIs).2  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sustaining growth and development. The Lao PDR is a lower-income country with a \npopulation of 6.9 million people. Its economy grew at an annual average of 7% from 2005 to \n2015. Poverty incidence fell from 46% in 1992 to 23% in 2012. The trajectory toward stronger \nand sustained growth underscores the critical importance of university education. The lack of a \nwell-educated workforce is a critical constraint to growth.3 A survey of graduates\u2019 skills and \nemployers\u2019  requirements 4  conducted  under  the  Strengthening  Higher  Education  Project \n(SHEP)5 identified the need to fill the gap between skills demand and supply. About 50% of \ncompanies face problems in recruiting staff, noting that graduates lack qualifications, knowledge, \nskills, and motivation (footnote 4). An inadequately educated workforce is a key challenge to \ndoing business in the Lao PDR.6 The higher education subsector needs to provide job-ready \ngraduates, generate research to support socioeconomic development, and partner with industry \nand government in productivity-enhancing endeavors.7 It must provide an enabling environment \nfor building knowledge and developing solutions for complex emerging issues. The government \nis  strengthening  its  higher  education  subsector  to  meet  the  demand  for  high-level  skills, \nparticularly in the growing manufacturing, and service sectors, which are increasingly needed as \nthe country moves away from an agriculture-based economy. \n4.  Strengthening higher education. The Lao PDR\u2019s higher education subsector is striving \nto meet international and regional standards. Universities fall short in equipping students with \nrequisite competencies for employment because of a combination of interrelated factors. Higher \neducation curricula are outdated and unresponsive to industry needs. Teaching methods rely \nheavily on lectures and provide marginal opportunities for practical learning or development of \njob skills. Faculty members are relatively inexperienced and lack relevant pedagogical and \nresearch training, and postgraduate degrees. Learning facilities and equipment are obsolete. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Second \nStrengthening Higher Education Project (TA 8837). \n3  ADB. 2011.

Mohrman, W. Ma, and D. Baker. 2008. The Research University in Transition: The Emerging Global Model.  \nHigher Education Policy. 21 (1).  \n ", "2 \nThe potential of universities to support national development through research and knowledge \ngeneration is largely untapped. Underinvestment in higher education makes sustaining reform \ninitiatives difficult. In 2014, the Lao PDR\u2019s gross enrollment ratio for tertiary education stood at \n17.1%, which is well below that of neighboring countries such as Viet Nam and Thailand, but \nhigher than Cambodia\u2019s.8 Total higher education enrollment in AY2014/15 was 130,807, of \nwhich 25% was at the four public universities under the supervision of the Ministry of Education \nand Sports (MOES).9 Enrollment rates are stifled by lack of access as a result of limited facilities, \nhigh costs of education relative to incomes, and limited scholarships. Another issue confronting \nthe subsector is the weak leadership and administration of HEIs.10 SHEP tackled key quality \nissues  by  enhancing  the  capacities  of  higher  education  staff,  strengthening  curriculum \ndevelopment,  and  improving  quality  assurance  processes.  These  initiatives  will  be  further \nenhanced under the project. SHEP improved access to higher education by upgrading the \nlearning environment, particularly at Champasack University, and a similar approach will be \nundertaken  under the project for  Savannakhet  University.  The  project  will  consolidate  and \nsustain the gains of SHEP in reforming the higher education subsector by providing further \nsupport to enhance the capacity of universities to deliver higher quality programs and services. \n5.  Improving relevance and quality. Most HEIs do not meet the same quality standards \nas those of other countries in Southeast Asia. The employer survey (footnote 4) reported that \n92% of the respondent graduates found jobs within 1 year of graduation; about 24% became \neventually unemployed. Only 6% of higher education graduates were employed in industrial and \ndeveloping sectors (energy 2.6%, mining 0.7%, and construction 2.7%). In 2015, the Lao PDR \nranked 112th out of 140 countries in the higher education and training component of the global \ncompetitiveness index.11 The government envisages building on the higher education quality \nassurance processes that were initiated under SHEP. \n6.  Enhancing qualifications of academic staff. The lack of qualified academic staff with \nadvanced degrees is a key reason for the low quality of higher education.12 In 2015, 45.2% of \nstaff in the National University of Laos (NUOL) had a postgraduate degree (6.7% had doctoral \ndegrees and 38.5% had master\u2019s degrees) and the remaining 54.8% had bachelor\u2019s degrees. In \n2015, the doctoral\u2013master\u2019s\u2013bachelors\u2019 degree ratio was 1:16:50 at Champasack University, \n1:34:48 at Souphanouvong University, and 1:5:35 at Savannakhet University.13 \n7.  Improving research capacity. The academic and applied research capacity of HEIs is \nlimited. While higher education research is supporting the advancement of higher education and \nteaching, its potential is not being fully harnessed, particularly in the development of science \nand technology disciplines. Of the four public universities under the MOES, only NUOL has \nsufficient teaching staff with the ability to conduct research. The other three universities do not \nhave enough qualified academic staff and research facilities. \n                                                \n8  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO).

Providing  adequate  financing. Public expenditure on education as a proportion of \ngross domestic product rose from 1.0% in 1999 to 2.8% in 2010.14 Despite this upward trend, \nthe Lao PDR ranks among the lowest in Southeast Asia in education spending relative to gross \ndomestic product.15 In 2012, public expenditure on education was 12% of total government \nexpenditure. Expenditure on tertiary education as a proportion of government expenditure on \neducation was 7.2% in 2012, ranking the Lao PDR 122nd out of 129 countries. Tuition fees at \npublic universities are low and quota students pay no tuition fees.16 Public universities have little \nincentive to raise revenues because the Ministry of Finance may reduce government grants to \nuniversities rather than allow them to retain the income. \n9.  Strengthening governance and management. The higher education subsector suffers \nfrom weak coordination of overall planning, management, and monitoring. The management \ncapacity of the Department of Higher Education (DHE) is limited. Collection and analysis of data \nto support higher education policy development, planning, and management is weak. All public \nuniversities have governance structures in line with government policy, but these structures are \nsupply-driven, and the degree of autonomy enjoyed by HEIs is low.17 NUOL, the largest HEI in \nthe Lao PDR, is one of the least autonomous among the universities in Asia (footnote 10). The \nproject will help tackle these challenges by supporting policy advisory work on devolution of \nauthority to the HEIs. To lay the groundwork for more institutional and fiscal autonomy of HEIs, \nit is essential to improve their governance mechanisms and to revise the regulatory and funding \nframeworks for higher education. A more enabling environment with a demand-side focus will \nhelp HEIs function more effectively and autonomously, particularly in areas of curriculum design, \nstudent admission, institutional structure, resource mobilization, and fund management. \n10.  Expanding access to higher education. While HEIs have expanded their facilities and \nservices to meet increasing demand, their capacity to absorb secondary school graduates \n(footnote  10)  and support  the country\u2019s  socioeconomic  development through research  and \nextension services remains limited.18 The proportion of women at the diploma level is the same \nas at the primary education level; it is even slightly higher than at lower and upper secondary \nlevels. This implies that HEIs do not amplify gender inequality at the undergraduate level, but at \nleast stabilize rates inherited from the school system. Only at the bachelor level does female \nparticipation start to wither. In AY 2014/15, the proportion of female bachelor\u2019s degree students \nwas 45%, and of master\u2019s degree students it was 37%.19 The project, which builds on the \nprogress made toward an expanded and more efficient higher education system under SHEP, is \ngender mainstreamed to make access to higher education more equitable and bring more \nwomen into fields with more job prospects, such as engineering and science. \n11.  Savannakhet University is the youngest of the four public universities under MOES\u2019 \nsupervision. Its first intake of 900 students was in AY2009/10 in 10 disciplines under four \nfaculties. It currently has 4,000 students in 29 disciplines across seven faculties.20 Savannakhet \nUniversity is strategically located to support business and industrial activities in the region, but \nits current campus and resources are inadequate to provide all the needed programs and \n                                                \n14 UNESCO.

However, human \ndevelopment  indicators  in  this  region  are  low.  In  2015,  only  60%  of  10,000  high  school \ngraduates were able to find placements at the tertiary level. Savannakhet University is gearing \nup for expansion both in the number of students and of programs offered. The project provides \nan opportunity to improve Savannakhet University\u2019s capacity to apply modern pedagogical and \nresearch principles, which can be a model for HEIs in the Lao PDR and regionally. \n12.  Strategic fit. The country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for the Lao PDR21 aligns with the country's Five Year National Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan VIII (2016\u20132020).22 Cognizant of the country's development priorities the \ncountry partnership strategy prioritizes education and assists the government in diversifying the \neconomy in a sustainable and inclusive manner. It will also facilitate regional integration, in \nparticular within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations community. The eighth National \nSocio-Economic Development Plan has guided the design of the project as the main policy \ndocument  behind  the  Education  Sector  Development  Plan  2016\u20132020;  both  emphasize  (i) \ndevelopment of science, technology, and innovation; (ii) cooperation with the industrial sector in \nconducting research and development; and (iii) provision of technical services for society by \nusing research findings to inform socioeconomic policies and programs. The Education Sector \nDevelopment Plan addresses the gaps in the higher education subsector, and aims to increase \nuniversity  enrollment  from  36,000  in  2016  to  45,000  in  2020.  The  proposed  Second \nStrengthening  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  Project23 aims  to  boost \ntechnical  skills  and  complement  the  strengthening  of  higher-level  skills  under  the  project. \nCollective efforts to enhance post-secondary education support the overall national human \nresource development strategy of sustaining growth and achieving a more competitive economy. \n13.  Lessons learned. ADB has supported seven education projects in the Lao PDR since \n1991. The country assistance program evaluation rates the performance of ADB assistance in \nthe education sector successful. 24 SHEP, which closes in December 2016, has performed well, \nand has generally met all its targets. Key lessons under SHEP are: (i) quality enhancement \nrequires a more focused approach to curriculum development, with greater emphasis on e-\nlearning and blended learning modalities; (ii) a multi-path approach is key to developing well-\nrounded job skills; (iii) an integrated and functional approach is needed to equip universities with \nmodern facilities; (iv) greater emphasis should be placed on developing research capacity to \nsupport economic diversification and industrialization; (v) the regulatory environment for HEIs \nshould be revised; and (vi) institutional governance must be strengthened.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be stronger links between higher education services and socioeconomic \nneeds. The outcome will be improved quality of higher education services.

Technical \n20.  The project will provide (i) information technology equipment for the new campus of \nSavannakhet University; and (ii) research equipment for the environment COE at NUOL and \nagriculture COE at Champasack University. HEI managers have the requisite competencies to \nensure  sustainable  use  of  the  new  resources  and  facilities.  Supply  contracts  will  include \noperational training and maintenance and service agreements. The campus design highlights \nthe use of natural ventilation and heat reduction, and modern building solutions that are less \nexpensive to operate and maintain. All facilities will be built in line with national regulations and \n ", "8 \nwill apply international standards where these do not exist locally. The participating agencies will \nallocate necessary resources for the operation and maintenance of the new facilities. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The project outputs will generate substantial socioeconomic benefits.30 Savannakhet \nUniversity infrastructure development, which accounts for about two-thirds of the project cost, \nhas a positive net present value at the 10% discount rate, supplying about 600 higher-skilled \ngraduates  annually.  The  professional  development  programs  will  improve  productivity  and \neffectiveness  of  teachers  and  administrators,  and  promote  more  efficient  use  of  higher \neducation  resources.  Academic  staff  and  students  in  selected  fields  will  benefit  from \ninternational-standard research laboratories that can support the utilization of locally conducted \nresearch. Stronger university\u2013industry partnerships will boost economic development. \n22.  The financial analysis estimates annual recurrent costs arising from the project as a \nwhole at $5.1 million in the early 2020s.31 Savannakhet University will need adequate operation \nand  maintenance  funding  from  the  government.  The  financial  analysis  also  highlights  that \ngrowth in government subsidies cannot cover fully the recurrent funding of HEIs in the long term. \nTo diversify the funding base, it will be necessary to increase student fees and boost HEI \ncapacity to raise income. The project will support the revision of the higher education regulatory \nand funding framework under output 3 to enhance the institutional and fiscal autonomy of HEIs. \nRevenue  streams  from  COE  components,  research  and  extension  services,  and  industry \npartnerships will strengthen HEIs\u2019 financial resources and ease the state\u2019s funding burden. \nC.  Governance \n23.  Assessments of financial and procurement management capacities were carried out and \nkey findings are incorporated in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 Despite \npublic sector management reforms, significant shortcomings remain in public accountability \nmechanisms,  overall  capacity  and  integrity  of  government  agencies,  public  financial \nmanagement, and procurement. Implementation risk at the project level is low. MOES has many \nyears of experience managing nationwide programs satisfactorily. MOES has sound public \nfinancial management and procurement systems, as shown by the successful implementation of \nADB-assisted education projects.33 To strengthen financial management, the project will support \ncapacity  building  within  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  other  project \nstakeholders in financial planning, accounting, reporting, auditing, and control. \n24.  DHE  has  considerable  experience  in  procuring  civil  works,  goods,  and  services. \nHowever, overall project risk associated with the general procurement environment is still rated \nhigh.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  implementation  delays,  DHE  will  recruit  qualified,  short-term \ninternational and national procurement consultants to provide training on (i) procurement and \ncontract management, and preparation of bid documents; (ii) procurement of goods, works, and \n                                                \n30 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. 2006.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MOES, and the implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 29). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  Poverty and social impacts. The project will provide graduates of participating HEIs \nwith better opportunities for employment and higher income, which will feed into the local and \nnational economies. Students will benefit from a better curriculum and learning environment. \nHigher education extension services will facilitate knowledge transfer and skills development \nwithin communities. Stronger critical-thinking skills will aid evidence-based public policy making. \nThe project will align labor supply with market demand by improving graduates\u2019 competencies. \nDuring campus construction, contracts will ensure that local labor is used to the extent possible. \nMeasures will be undertaken to inform construction workers and local communities about health \nrisks. An environmental monitoring plan with a grievance redress mechanism will be established. \n27.  Gender  and  development. The project\u2019s gender dimension builds on lessons from \nSHEP and will narrow gender gaps in university enrollment and increase academic credentials \nof female DHE and university staff. Proactive gender inputs, including scholarships, career \ncounseling, and training opportunities, will increase gender parity in the Lao PDR university \nsystem. The project has a gender equity theme, ensuring that project activities are free from \ngender bias and that opportunities will be accessible regardless of gender. A gender action plan \nwas prepared and includes targets and a rigorous monitoring and evaluation plan.34 \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment. The project is rated category B. With the exception of impacts during \ncampus construction, the project does not have significant adverse impacts on the environment, \nand any risks can be mitigated by implementing the environmental management plan. An initial \nenvironmental evaluation was carried out and an environment management plan developed.35 \nCompliance  with  the  environmental  management  plan  will  be  required  during  project \nimplementation by MOES, with assistance from consultants to be contracted by the project to \nprovide supervision and quality assurance of civil works. Contractors will control noise and dust \nand manage land-fill and solid waste disposal during campus construction. \n29.  Involuntary  settlement.  The  project  is  rated  category  C.  Civil  works  in  the  new \nSavannakhet  University  campus  will  be  carried  out  on  government  land.  Due  diligence \nconfirmed that no informal settlers reside on the project site. The project has no land acquisition \nor  resettlement  issues,  and  no  activities  will  result  in  involuntary  physical  or  economic \ndisplacement of people. \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The project is rated category C. Indigenous peoples will not be \nnegatively  impacted.  Students,  staff,  and  administrators  of  Savannakhet  University  are  not \nconsidered indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project \nwill not specifically target any ethnic minority group as beneficiaries, but will be designed to be \nsocially inclusive and accessible to all. \n                                                \n34 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 32).
