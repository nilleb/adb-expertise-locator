These  PAs  are\nsome of the most species-rich and endemic-rich ecosystems in\nAsia, and are important catchments for major hydropower and\nirrigation  systems.    Surrounded  by  some  of  the  country\u2019s\npoorest  communities,  however,  they  have  come  under\nincreasing risk of encroachment and exploitation. To protect\nthese  ecosystems,  the  Project  embraces  a  reform  of  the\nsector\u2019s legal and institutional framework in conjunction with\ncapacity  building,  ecotourism  development,  and  the\nestablishment  of  a  sustainable  financing  mechanism  for  PA\nmanagement.  By developing and pilot-testing decentralized\nand people-oriented approaches to PA management, including\ncommunity improvement and benefit sharing, the Project will be\ninstrumental  in  establishing  a  PA  system  in  Sri  Lanka  that\nprotects  wildlife  biodiversity  effectively  and  generates\nemployment and income.\nClassification Primary: Environment\nSecondary: Poverty reduction\nEnvironmental\nAssessment Category  B\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken.\nRationale Sri  Lanka\u2019s  high  population  density,  levels  of  poverty  and\nunemployment, and widespread dependence on subsistence\nagriculture  have  exerted  considerable  pressure  on  the\ncountry\u2019s PAs. The PA system is central to conserving wildlife\nbiodiversity.  It is also important in supporting rural economies\nthrough watershed protection, and adds to the economic and\ncultural  values  of  Sri  Lanka  through  the  provision  of\nrecreational,  ecotourism,  scientific,  and  educational\nopportunities.  The  PAs  and  the  services  and  benefits  they\nprovide  are  currently  not  effectively  protected  due  to  weak\ninstitutions, lack of resources, inadequate managerial skills and\ntechnical capacity throughout the sector institutions, and lack of\ncooperation between conservation agencies. To address these\nweaknesses  will  require  efforts  particularly  in  the  areas  of\nhuman  resource  development,  improvement  of  managerial\nsystems and technical skills, and the provision of infrastructure\nand  equipment.  Greater  interagency  cooperation  is\nfundamental to this strengthening and the development of a\nmore strategic approach to addressing conservation priorities in", "iii\nSri Lanka. Effective PA management cannot take place in the\nlong  term  without  the  involvement  and  support  of  the  local\ncommunities. Similarly, rural livelihoods are dependent on a\nflow of natural resource benefits, many of which cannot be\nsustained without active protective measures. To build these\npartnerships requires a greater capacity within the conservation\nagencies  to  understand  and  work  with  local  communities.\nFundamentally,  effective  community  empowerment  is\nnecessary to allow the communities to plan for their own future\nand interact with Government agencies and the private sector.\nPart of this vision will involve low-impact use of PAs and the\ncapturing of benefits by communities and the private sector\nthrough  ecotourism  development.  The  key  need  is  to\nstrengthen the sector institutions to manage PAs, in partnership\nwith and in the interests of local stakeholders.\nObjectives and Scope The Project aims at assisting the Government to conserve the\nnation\u2019s  valuable  natural  resources  and  preserve  its  wildlife\nbiodiversity for the well-being of current and future generations.\nMore  specifically,  by  addressing  institutional  and  legal\ndeficiencies in PA management and pilot-testing participatory\nadaptive management in priority PAs, the Project is expected to\nstimulate  nature-based  tourism  and  to  contribute  to  the\ndevelopment  of  a  sustainable  PA  management  and  wildlife\nconservation system for Sri Lanka.\nThe Project comprises four components. Component A aims at\n(i) strengthening DWLC to become a decentralized, credible,\nand  effective  department  fully  able  to  manage  its  policy\ndevelopment  and  operational  responsibilities  for  results;  (ii)\nenabling DWLC to be technically able to plan and implement\ncomplex conservation strategies; (iii) establishing ecotourism\ncapacity and services; and (iv) establishing informed decision\nmaking with effective monitoring and evaluation at all levels.\nComponent B aims to strengthen the management of seven\npilot  PAs  through  (i)  revision  of  management  plans  and\nsubsequent implementation of adaptive management systems,\n(ii)  providing  the  supportive  infrastructure  and  equipment  to\nenable  the  staff  to  complete  their  work  effectively,  and  (iii)\nexpansion of ecotourism services and products.  Component C\naims to develop collaborative intersectoral planning through the\npreparation  of  the  Biodiversity  Conservation  Action  Plan\n(BCAP),  a  conservation  system  review,  and  endangered\nspecies  management.    Component  D  will  establish  the\nProtected  Area  Conservation  Trust  (PACT),  a  sustainable\nfinancing  mechanism  for  community-conservation  inter-\nlinkages outside Government.\nCost Estimates The total project cost, including interest charges, and physical\nand  price  contingencies,  is  estimated  at  $34.7  million\nequivalent, of which $17.6 million (51 percent) is the foreign", "iv\nexchange cost and $17.1 million equivalent (49 percent) is the\nlocal currency cost.\nFinancing Plan\n      ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development Bank 6.6 5.4 12.0 35\nGlobal Environment Facility 7.0 3.2 10.2 28\nNetherlands Government 4.0 -     4.0 12\nGovernment of Sri Lanka - 7.7     7.7 22\nBeneficiaries - 0.9  0.9        3\nTotal     17.6     17.1 34.7    100\nLoan Amount\nand Terms The equivalent in various currencies of SDR8,997,000 ($12.0\nmillion) from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Special\nFunds resources.

The PMU will be\nresponsible for day-to-day administration and implementation\nof  project  activities  in  cooperation  with  other  key\nimplementation  agencies,  civil  society  organizations,  and\nbusiness interests. A branch PMU will be established at each of\nthe pilot sites. Social mobilization and buffer zone activities\nunder the Project will be executed by the PACT through local\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  or  community-based\norganizations  (CBOs)  with  relevant  experience.  Project\nactivities in the impact zone will be based on a village-level\nagreement  derived  through  a  participatory  microplanning\nprocess  linked  to  conservation  goals.  A  National  Advisory\nCommittee  on  Wildlife  Conservation,  representative  of  key\nstakeholder  interests,  will  be  established  to  serve  as  a\nsounding board and adviser to the Project.  The collaborative\nplanning  activities  will  be  implemented  by  the  Biodiversity\nConservation  Secretariat  under  the  Ministry  of  Forests  and\nEnvironment, using teams drawn from multiple agencies.\nExecuting Agencies The Department of Wildlife Conservation within the Ministry of\nPublic Administration and Home Affairs for components A and\nB, and the Ministry of Forests and Environment for component\nC. Consultants operating from the PMU will execute component\nD.", "v\nProcurement Civil  works,  materials,  and  equipment  will  be  procured  in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement.  Given that\nthe value of each civil works contract is estimated to be less\nthan $1 million and in view of the competitive nature of the\nconstruction sector in Sri Lanka, civil works contracts are not\nexpected to be of interest to international bidders.  Thus, all\ncivil  works  contracts  will  be  awarded  to  prequalified  private\nsector contractors under local competitive bidding procedures\nacceptable to ADB. Contracts for supply of materials, vehicles,\nand  equipment  costing  $100,000-$500,000  will  be  awarded\nthrough international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB,\nwhereas those that are below $100,000 will be procured on the\nbasis of direct purchase.\nConsulting Services It is anticipated that a total of 172 person-months of domestic\nand 128 person-months of international consulting services\nwill be required in addition to a consortium of international\nNGOs.    The  consultants  and  NGOs  will  be  recruited  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the\nengagement of domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date 31 December 2006\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries With  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  18\npercent,  the  project  components  that  were  subjected  to\neconomic assessment, are economically viable.  Most of the\ndirect project benefits relate to the generation of income and\nemployment opportunities in the impact zone of the seven pilot\nPAs.    It  is  anticipated  that,  initially,  40,000  households  or\n180,000 people living in 192 villages near the pilot PAs will\ndirectly benefit from the Project.  With poverty levels in excess\nof  50  percent,  these  communities  belong  to  the  country\u2019s\npoorest.  Through improved PA management, the Project will\naddress the human-elephant conflict and thereby reduce the\nconsiderable losses of crops and lives that the conflict causes\nevery year. With focus on natural beauty and wildlife diversity in\nthe PAs for the development of ecotourism, employment will be\ngenerated.  The development of ecotourism is also expected to\naid the conservation effort by providing an economic alternative\nto overexploitation of the natural resources of PAs. As a result\nof project activities such as the upgrading of park facilities,\nestablishment of visitor centers, and promotion of ecotourism,\nmore tourists will be attracted to the project areas. Therefore,\nthe demand for nature guides and locally produced handicrafts\nwill increase.  The Project will also generate significant benefits\nthat cannot be quantified.  For example, by strengthening the\ninstitutional capacity for PA management, mechanisms to be", "vi\nput in place will ensure that the country\u2019s large numbers of\nnative, endemic, and endangered species and ecosystems will\nbe preserved sustainably for the benefit of present and future\ngenerations.    Other  non-quantifiable  benefits  relate  to  the\ncarbon  sequestration  value  of  forests,  the  conservation  of\nbiodiversity, microclimate amelioration, nutrient recycling, and\nscientific  research  and  education.    Further,  both  male  and\nfemale community members will acquire the capacity to better\narticulate their development priorities through a participatory\naction planning process.", "vii", "I.      THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Protected Area Management and\nWildlife Conservation Project.\nII.      INTRODUCTION\n2. In 1997, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance\nto formulate a project to conserve wildlife biodiversity, to develop nature-based tourism, and to\nstrengthen community participation in protected area (PA) management. In response, ADB\napproved in December 1997 technical assistance (TA) to assist the Government in preparing an\ninvestment project.1 The final report was submitted in February 1999, and an ADB Fact-Finding\nMission visited Sri Lanka in April 1999. Subsequently, the Project was found to be eligible, in\nprinciple, for cofinancing by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The World Bank, as a GEF\nimplementing agency, agreed to jointly process the Project with ADB.  To modify the project\ndesign to be consistent with GEF eligibility criteria and to initiate a policy and institutional reform\nagenda that was identified during fact-finding, additional TA,2 to be financed by GEF, was\nmobilized. A 15-member multisectoral Project Task Force that was appointed by the Minister of\nPublic Administration and Home Affairs (MPAHA) guided TA implementation.  The task force\nalso took the lead in developing a new National Wildlife Policy. Consistent with GEF public\ninvolvement policy, the TA was implemented in a participatory process involving stakeholder\nconsultation through 15 facilitated workshops at the community, provincial, and national levels.\nSix additional workshops were held for policy makers and Government staff involved in PA\nmanagement. A joint ADB and World Bank Appraisal Mission3 visited Sri Lanka from 17 April to\n3 May 2000, and reached an understanding with the Government on the Project\u2019s design and\naccompanying policy dialogue. The project framework is attached as Appendix 1.\nIII.      BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n3. Sri Lanka is a tropical island of 65,610 square kilometers (km2), considered to be one of\nthe most biologically rich per unit area. Government policies and programs have resulted in high\nindices of human development; however, civil conflict has drained resources from the economy\nand inhibited growth in international tourism since the early 1980s.  In 1998, the average life\nexpectancy was 73 years, infant mortality rate was 15 per 1,000 live births, the adult literacy\nrate was 91 percent, and the primary school enrollment rate was close to 100 percent. The\npopulation growth rate at 1.2 percent annually is low by world standards; however, the 1998\npopulation, estimated to be 18.8 million, represents an average population density of 299\npersons per km2 that is forecast to reach 371 in 2025.\n4. The population is 78 percent rural, about a third of the land area is under permanent\ncultivation, and marginal lands are increasingly brought into production.  Natural forest cover is\nless than 22 percent of the land area, and deforestation continues at an annual rate of 1.1\n                                                \n1 TA 2942-SRI: Biodiversity Conservation Project, for $800,000, approved on 12 December 1997.\n2  TA 3273-SRI: Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project, for $330,000, approved on 13\nOctober 1999.\n3 The Mission comprised A.

Local authorities are predicting catchment\ndamage, which means that serious water shortages are emerging and the trend is expected to\nworsen.\n1. Significance of Protected Areas\n5. Sri Lanka is a global biodiversity hot spot.5 About half of its species are endemic,\nincluding  all  freshwater  crabs,  90  percent  of  amphibians,  25-75  percent  of  reptiles  and\ninvertebrates, around 50 percent of freshwater fishes, 26 percent of flowering plants, 14 percent\nof mammals and at least as many nonmigrant birds.  Species richness is extreme and, although\nlittle studied, there are known to be over 3,368 species of flowering plants, 314 ferns, 575\nmosses, 190 liverworts, 896 algae, 1,920 fungi, 400 arachnids, 242 butterflies, 117 dragonflies\nand damselflies, 139 mosquitoes, 525 carabid beetles, 266 land snails, 78 fresh-water fishes,\n250 amphibians, 92 snakes, 35 freshwater crabs, 21 geckos, 21 skinks, 322 nonmigrant birds,\nand 86 mammals. The island also provides critical habitat for internationally mobile species,\nincluding 5 species of endangered marine turtle, about 100 species of waterfowl, and many\nother migratory birds.\n6. The PA system represents the ecosystems that support these species.  It therefore\nprovides (i) global benefits by maintaining endemic lineages, species, and higher taxa that\nwould otherwise go extinct, ecosystems that are under threat elsewhere, and populations of\nmigratory species; and (ii) national and local benefits by maintaining biodiversity resources and\nall the use, option, bequest, and existence values associated with them.  By safeguarding\necosystems  that  protect  important  economic  infrastructure  against  floods,  landslides,  soil\nerosion, and siltation, the PA system also generates substantial indirect use values.  The PAs in\nthe Mahaweli Development Area, for example, sustain 25 percent of the country\u2019s rice harvest,\nwhile 17 percent of the national energy supply comes from hydropower facilities that depend on\nprotected catchments and are fed by rivers arising in the PA system.\n7. The  PA  system  contributes  to  enriching  the  lives  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Sri\nLankans  and  smaller  numbers  of  overseas  visitors  through  provision  of  recreational\nopportunities.6  The  system  also  provides  the  resource  base  for  developing  the  globally\ncompetitive ecotourism7 potential of Sri Lanka. Development of ecotourism can generate greater\nsupport for conservation and build partnerships between government agencies, the private\nsector, and communities that help reduce rural poverty by providing employment and increasing\ntourism revenues. PAs also provide the prime outdoor laboratories for scientists and students to\nlearn more about the functioning of natural ecosystems. They also have the capacity to sustain\nfar greater use as a resource for education and scientific research aimed at documenting the\nnation\u2019s biological wealth.  By these means, the wildlife resources of the PA system can be used\nsustainably in diversifying the Sri Lankan economy and further enriching its culture.  Managing\nPAs sustainably will generate locally captured values that help improve the quality of life of local\npeople who currently have on average the least secure livelihoods in the country.\n                                                \n4  Wood provides about 57 percent of all energy consumed in Sri Lanka.\n5  Myers, N., R.A.

Poverty Around Protected Areas\n8. Current estimates of poverty indicate 21 percent of all Sri Lankans have incomes below\nthe current Government poverty criteria.8 Although abject poverty is rare9, current figures from\nthe UNICEF show more than two million Sri Lankan children exhibit signs of growth stunting,\none third are underweight for their age, and one half of all pregnant women are malnourished\nand anemic. Government poverty programs have focused on improving rural livelihoods by\ndeveloping skills with extension and credit support, and providing infrastructure and marketing\nsupport. Despite these efforts, the incidence of poverty in rural areas remains high, and at about\n25 percent is higher than the 15 percent in urban areas. Previous poverty studies indicated only\nlimited regional variation in poverty, but preliminary analyses10 of more recent data indicate\nlarge disparities in the incidence and intensity of poverty between regions.  All social indicators,\nincluding access to electricity, safe water, and sanitation, vary widely between provinces, and\nare  considerably  worse  in  the  plantation  and/or  rain-fed  agriculture  provinces  of  Uva,\nSabaragamuwa, North Central, and North West.\n9. Among the estimated 1.5 million rural people who live close to a PA boundary, average\npoverty incidences are typically much higher than the national average.  The median among\nvillages studied during project preparation was 52 percent, more than double the national\naverage based on Samurdhi participation rates.  The de facto official poverty line, which is\nmeasured by the percentage of the population receiving the Government\u2019s Samurdhi welfare\npayments whose calculation is based on household income levels, is much higher in the villages\nclose to PAs.  Poverty is associated with not only low level of incomes but also lack of secure\nincomes  and  employment.  Such  insecurity  can  be  traced  to  an  unstable  resource  base,\nincluding landlessness. Landless households are dependent on insecure tenurial agreements\nwith landowners; lack recognized land titles, limiting them to informal moneylenders; and obtain\nlow prices for farm produce as a result of dependence on middlemen and lack of alternative\nmarket access. Thus, the overall pattern among communities near the PAs is one of significant\npoverty.\n10. Low and unpredictable incomes are key features of poverty. The resulting insecurity\nmeans  that  many  households  have  at  least  one  member  who  is  searching  for  work\nopportunities, formal or otherwise.  These individuals are used as casual labor by wealthier\nneighbors and outsiders, and are vulnerable to being co-opted in support of livestock grazing,\nlogging, poaching, and gemstone mining within the PAs. Demand for land, tenure insecurity,\nand lack of income all make the poorer and more marginalized members of communities close\nto PAs particularly likely to use protected ecosystems as subsistence resources, for farmland,\ncattle grazing, and fuelwood in particular. The institutions mandated with PA management has\nnot yet developed an effective capacity to respond to this situation, so there is steady erosion of\nthe PA system and the wildlife and floral resources it contains.  A scenario of continually\nincreasing demand outside the PAs implies that protected ecosystems will be increasingly under\npressure in the future.  This highlights the vicious circle that unites human poverty with resource\nimpoverishment.\n                                                \n8  Sri Lanka does not have an official poverty indicator.  For policy purposes, those eligible to receive SLRs500 or\nmore per month under the Government\u2019s Samurdhi program are classified as being in poverty.\n9  Defined as an income below one\u2018s \u201cpurchasing-power parity dollar\u201d per day, which applies to about four percent\nof Sri Lankans.\n10  World Bank . 2000. Sri Lanka - Poverty Update. (draft)", "4\n3. The Protected Area System\n11. Three Government agencies are directly involved in protecting ecosystem resources: the\nDepartment of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC) in MPAHA, the Forestry Department (FD) in the\nMinistry of Forests and Environment (MFE), and the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) in\nthe Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and Development.  Other concerned agencies\ninclude  the  Central  Environmental  Authority,  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  and  the  Land\nCommissioner. The primary responsibility for protecting wildlife resources, however, lies with\nDWLC.  Under the authority of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of 1937, DWLC\nmanages 73 national reserves and sanctuaries, covering 8,218 km2 or 12.4 percent of the total\nland area.11  Additional DWLC functions include (i) issuing permits and collecting fees related to\nPAs or pertaining to wildlife generally; (ii) reviewing environmental impact assessments for\nactivities that may affect a PA; (iii) operating elephant rehabilitation and reintroduction facilities;\nand  (iv)  managing  bungalows,  campsites,  and  other  visitor  facilities  in  the  PAs.    These\nmanagement activities, however, do not effectively respond to the main threat to the PA system,\nwhich is the encroachment pressure that results from a strong demand for land and subsistence\nresources -  especially fuelwood and other resources for consumption or sale - and such illegal\nand commercial resource exploitation as grazing, logging, poaching, and gemstone mining. The\nresult is frequent conflicts of interest between local people and PA managers, and a steady\nerosion of the PA system and its wildlife and floral resources.\n4. Key Sector Issues\na. Legislative Framework\n12. The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (FFPO) of 1937 governs the protection of\nwildlife  throughout  the  country.    Despite  various  amendments,  the  FFPO  is  outdated  and\nineffective as a tool with which to address pressures on the country\u2019s ecological resources.\nNew legislation is needed to support new standards for ecosystem and habitat management,\nthe role of communities living in the buffer zones, and the role of the private sector in supporting\nPA management and ecotourism development.  Multiple and overlapping responsibilities are\nalso assigned to government departments under current laws, with 12 separate laws to govern\nforest management implemented by 10 separate agencies, and another 12 laws to govern land\nmanagement, which are also implemented by 10 separate agencies.  Thus, there is a need to\nharmonize wildlife-related law, especially the National Forestry Policy and National Wildlife\nPolicy  and  the  law  in  line  with  both,  to  respond  effectively  and  comprehensively  to  the\nConvention on Biological Diversity, and to develop a comprehensive Biodiversity Conservation\nAction Plan (BCAP) to consolidate all other initiatives within a consistent framework.\nb. Institutional Framework\n13. Multiple and overlapping responsibilities in the wildlife and biodiversity sector requires\nclose interagency cooperation. However, such cooperation has proved hard to accomplish\nalthough  a  number  of  coordinating  bodies  have  been  established,  including  a  Biodiversity\nConservation Secretariat within MFE, a National Committee on Sustainable Development, and a\nCommittee on Integrating Environment and Development. FD, within MFE, has an important\nportfolio  of  biodiversity-related  responsibilities  at  various  levels  of  decision  making,  the\nintegration of which with those of DWLC is identified as critical priority by intersectoral studies\nincluding the National Environmental Action Plan (1991, revised in 1994 and 1997), National\n                                                \n11  FD manages an additional 70 PAs covering 1,486 km2 or 2.4 percent of the land area.", "5\nConservation Review (1997), and Biodiversity Conservation in Sri Lanka: a Framework for\nAction (1998).\nc. Institutional Capacity\n14. DWLC has been transferred repeatedly to different ministries, and has experienced a\nhigh turnover of directors.  Its operations and culture follow largely a reactive, centralized,\n\u201ccommand and control\u201d model that is no longer able to deal with the complexities it faces.  It is\ninward looking in its thinking and procedures, when most challenges are best met by looking\noutward in a strategic and proactive manner.  It needs to be able to work more effectively with\nother  stakeholders,  including  other  Government  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs), the private sector, and local communities.  The management systems of DWLC require\na stronger technical and managerial capacity at all levels, transparent and responsive budgetary\nsystems, clear lines of accountability and reporting, mechanisms for performance monitoring,\nand incentives to maximize staff motivation. The current system for managing conservation\nfinances  is  also  inadequate,  since  PA  revenues  are  variously  directed  in  many  small\ntransactions to the Wildlife Preservation Fund and the national consolidated fund, providing\nopportunities  for  leakage  along  the  way.  There  is  a  need  for  greater  transparency  and\naccountability in all aspects of financial management. In summary, DWLC needs to embrace a\nculture  of  quality  public-sector  management,  which  includes  a  commitment  to  promote  a\nforward-looking professional ability to use transparent and effective managerial systems and\nmodern  technology,  while  developing  public  confidence  in  its  operations  and  addressing\ncomplex multi-stakeholder issues using adaptive processes.\nd. Poverty, Encroachment, and Community Relations\n15. The  underlying  causes  of  unsustainable  use  of  protected  ecosystems  include  the\npoverty and deprivation common in many villages surrounding PAs although the majority of the\nhouseholds do not entirely depend on the PA resources for their main source of livelihood.\nPeople living near PAs, and others with their connivance, harvest timber, fuelwood, wild meat,\nand other forest products for subsistence use and sale. Gemstone mining and agricultural\nencroachment are widespread.  An estimated total of 150,000 cattle and buffaloes graze within\nthe PA system, competing with wild herbivores for food, trampling native ecosystems, and\nspreading alien and invasive weeds. Solutions are likely to include clear demarcation of PA\nboundaries, enhanced and coordinated enforcement, and the building of more cooperative\nrelationships with surrounding villagers. However, relations between the local communities and\nPA managers often are tense as a result of conflicts of interest over encroachment and the\nillegal use of PA resources.  Further conflicts arise because DWLC has a mandate to protect\nelephants, yet these animals often enter settled areas and cause serious damage to property\nand life,12 for which current compensation arrangements are inappropriate. This situation makes\nit hard to base conservation on the understanding and support of local people, and there is a\nneed  for  a  fundamental  change  in  how  DWLC  staff  see  their  role  and  interact  with  local\ncommunities.\ne. Private Sector Involvement\n16. Private sector involvement is a national priority reflected most recently in the National\nWildlife Policy of 2000, which commits the Government to encourage the private sector to join\nas  a  full  partner  in  wildlife  conservation.    Private  sector  involvement  in  wildlife  and  PA\nmanagement is largely inhibited, however, by public concern that it should not undermine the\nlegitimate and necessary role of DWLC as the chief regulator of wildlife and PA use.  This\n                                                \n12  An estimated average of 50 people and 120 elephants die each year as a result of human-elephant conflict.", "6\nreflects an appreciation of the fragility of natural ecosystems and a suspicion that the short-term\nperspective of private enterprise might cause irreversible damage to natural systems.  This\nresistance to change is based partly on a lack of public familiarity with the way in which\nnumerous public-private partnerships already exist in Sri Lanka and contribute significantly to\nsocial progress.  In the context of the wildlife sector, areas of current practice include the use of\nprivate  contractors,  contractual  labor,  and  the  charging  of  user  fees,  while  imminent\nexperimentation is foreseen in the development of private insurance for elephant damage and\nconcessions for ecotourism services.\nf. Ecotourism Development\n17. Tourism is an important industry in Sri Lanka, but it is narrowly focused on inexpensive\npackage tours of beach resorts and cultural attractions.  This product mix has low profit margins\nper tourist and limited potential for future growth.  In 1999, 15 percent of the 436,000 foreign\nvisitors included PAs in their itineraries, a very low figure by international standards.  The\nreasons for this low PA visitation rate include lack of publicity, security concerns, and a narrow\nrange of tourism products and services. Legal constraints within the 1937 FFPO on private-\nsector involvement in tourism development in and around the PAs further compound these\ndifficulties.  Little attention has been paid to the ecotourism potential of the PA system in\nmarketing  the  country\u2019s  tourism  products.  As  a  result,  opportunities  to  link  biodiversity\nconservation with poverty reduction in some of the poorest areas of the country, and to make\nuse of private-sector skills to enhance economic growth and diversification are being lost.\ng. The Challenge of Implementation\n18. A notable weakness in the sector is inadequate implementation of national policies or PA\nmanagement  plans,  including  the  difficulty  that  underresourced  agencies  experience  in\nenforcing related laws.  For this reason, for example, the 1990 National Policy on Wildlife\nConservation was never implemented, and neither were most of the numerous PA management\nplans prepared by various funding agencies in association with FD, Central Environmental\nAuthority, or DWLC. This implies that written policies and plans should never be seen as ends in\nthemselves, and that far more attention should be given to (i) embedding consensus-based\npolicies within a network of committed institutions; (ii) introducing adaptive managerial systems,\nbased  on  dialogue,  forums,  conflict-management  processes,  incentive  structures,  and\ntransparent and accountable monitoring and evaluation procedures; and (iii) providing adequate\nresources for agencies to identify, intercept, process, prosecute, and sanction violators of the\nlaws that are envisioned by policies and assumed by management plans.  Such a change of\nemphasis, however, will require a willingness by the Government and its development partners\nto  invest  more  design  effort  in  institutionalizing  new  arrangements  by  which  policies  and\nmanagement plans are created and used, and more resources in the agencies responsible for\ncontrolling and managing these resources.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n19. Sri Lanka is a signatory to the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International\nImportance, the 1973 Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species,\nthe 1991 Bonn Convention on Migratory Species, and the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Convention on\nBiological Diversity (CBD).  Anticipating the CBD in many ways, the 1990 National Policy on\nWildlife Conservation envisioned reassessing the objectives of PA management according to\nthe principles of protection, sustainable use, efficient management, and regulation based on\nscientific knowledge and the needs of multiple stakeholders.", "7\n20. The National Forestry Policy and Forestry Sector Master Plan of 1995-1996 recognized\nthe rapid dwindling and increasing fragmentation of natural forests, especially in the wet zone.\nThe 1997 National Conservation Review identified priority sites for inclusion in the PA system.\nThese initiatives by MFE, which are in line with the CBD, refocused the FD on forest protection\nand the sustainable use of forest resources, including biodiversity.  A national Coastal Zone\nManagement Plan was prepared in 1990 and revised in 1996, and together with the 1994 report\nCoastal 2000, gave strategic direction to the CCD, identifying needs, and ways and means to\nprotect  the  country\u2019s  coastal  resources.  Consolidating  these  processes,  the  National\nEnvironmental  Action  Plan  of  1991  was  revised  in  1994  and  1997,  and  policy  dialogue\ncontinued among the main concerned institutions.  This led to the 1998 analysis, Biodiversity\nConservation in Sri Lanka: a Framework for Action.\n21. These various analyses have made the Government aware of the extent to which its\npoverty-reduction efforts are linked to problems faced in the management of PAs, and have led\nto a recognition of the value of a more integrated and participatory approach to resource\nmanagement.  The  Government  is  conscious  that  to  operationalize  its  policies  will  require\nspecific programs for skills upgrading, extension, credit, and savings mobilization, combined\nwith targeted welfare schemes, and that environmental degradation should be addressed at the\nsame time, by educating and involving the communities in all aspects of development decision\nmaking.  These measures are consistent with the need to develop the capacity to formulate\nlocal plans, especially where resource availability are very limited and declining.\n22. Early 2000 saw the development of a new National Wildlife Policy, led by a multisectoral\nTask Force with support provided by ADB. The policy articulates the Government\u2019s conclusions\nin relation to the sustainable and participatory management of wildlife resources in the context\nof the national poverty-eradication agenda.  In so doing, it sets the scene for amending the\nFFPO to remove inconsistencies with policy, for the preparation of a BCAP, and ultimately for\ncomplete harmonization of biodiversity-related policy, law, and conservation action in Sri Lanka.\nThis would allow all aspects of biodiversity to be developed consistently, fairly, and equitably,\nand thereby to contribute more effectively to the overriding aim of poverty elimination.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n23. Historically, ADB assistance in the natural resources and environment sectors focused\non increasing production in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; improving water supply and\nsanitation; and urban development. More recently, ADB assistance has shifted to address the\nresource  conservation-poverty  nexus  more  strategically  by  emphasizing  the  protection  and\nsustainable use of natural resources and the environment as a means to reduce poverty and as\na vehicle for sustainable development. The first ADB project with a strong focus on natural\nresource management was the Upper Watershed Management Project13 approved in 1997.\nThree other ADB natural resource management projects have since been approved or are being\nprocessed:  (i)  Coastal  Resource  Management  Project,14  (ii)  Forest  Resource  Management\nSector Project,15 and (iii) Water Resources Management Project. ADB has also supported policy\nformulation  and  institution  building  by  providing  advisory  TA  for  Strengthening  the\nImplementation  of  Environmental  Impact  Assessment,16  and  Institutional  Strengthening  for\n                                                \n13  Loan 1545-SRI: Upper Watershed Management Project, for $16.6 million, approved on 24 September 1997.\n14  Loan 1716-SRI: Coastal Resource Management, for $40 million, approved on 3 December 1999.\n15  Loan 1744-SRI: Forest Resources Management Sector, for $27.0 million, approved on 28 June 2000.\n16  TA 2765-SRI: Institutional Strengthening for Environmental Impact Assessment, for $600,000, approved on 10\nMarch 1997.", "8\nComprehensive Water Resources Management.17 ADB is also providing TA18 for institutional\ncapacity building, and a review of the policy and legal framework regarding the management of\nnatural resources and the environment.\n24. The  Netherlands  Government  is  supporting  innovative  management  planning  and\nimplementation in wetlands through two projects at the Central Environmental Authority with\nclose linkages to DWLC and other organizations. Management  planning for 25 wetland areas,\nsome of which belong to DWLC\u2019s PA system, was undertaken. Valuable lessons drawn from\nthese activities have been incorporated in the project design. The Norwegian Government has\nsupported mangrove protection, integrated coastal zone planning in Hambantota District, and\nmanagement planning for two forest reserves.  Two projects were recently approved by the\nGEF Medium Grants Program: one to conserve globally threatened species in the rain forests of\nthe  southwest,  and  the  other,  to  be  implemented  by  CCD,  DWLC,  and  International\nConservation  Union  (IUCN),  with  focus  on  coastal  wetlands.    The  World  Bank,  Britain\u2019s\nDepartment for International Development, and the Finnish International Development Agency\nhave supported FD in developing the Forestry Sector Master Plan and the National Forestry\nPolicy. The Canadian International Development Agency has concentrated on working with\nNGOs at the community level in coastal and highland plantation environments. The ongoing\nConservation  and  Sustainable  Use  of  Medicinal  Plants  Project  financed  by  GEF  and\nimplemented  by  the  World  Bank  is  another  important  undertaking  in  the  sector,  as  close\ncoordination  of  activities  is  envisaged  at  Ritigala  Strict  Nature  Reserve,  which  has  been\nincluded as a pilot PA under the proposed Project.\n25. Efforts to strengthen DWLC in the last two decades involved two major externally-\nassisted projects: (i) through the Mahaweli Environment Project, the United States Agency for\nInternational  Development  provided  assistance  in  the  1980s  to  develop  basic  institutional\ncapacity  for  biodiversity  conservation  and  PA  management,  especially  in  the  Mahaweli\ndevelopment area; and (ii) through the Development of Wildlife Conservation and Protected\nArea Management Project, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and GEF\nprovided assistance during the 1990s, which, among others, built capacity through staff training;\nestablished a geographic information system (GIS) unit; and prepared management plans for 10\nPAs. Details on external assistance in the sector are in Appendix 2.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n1.  Strengthening Institutions and Communities\n26. Final evaluation of the UNDP/GEF Project19 concluded that future GEF support should\nbe conditional on DWLC being restructured and decentralized under new leadership, and the\nintroduction of process mechanisms to allow better planning and budgeting.  Other lessons from\nthis project are that (i) training sources should be diversified to ensure the transfer of a variety of\nappropriate skills; (ii) institutional capacities to perform routine management and planning tasks,\nsuch as PA management planning, should be developed internally; (iii) measures should be\ntaken to improve work effectiveness of all levels of the organization; (iv) intangible management\nconstraints, such as staff morale, are highly influential in improving operational effectiveness;\n                                                \n17  TA 2422-SRI: Institutional Strengthening for Comprehensive Water Resources Management, for $1.570 million,\napproved on 12 October 1995.\n18  TA 3271-SRI: Sustainable Natural Resource Management for Development, for $800,000, approved  on 10\nOctober 1999.\n19  UNDP and FAO.

(August 1999).", "9\nand  (v)  all  levels  of  staff  should  be  consulted  in  the  process  of  project  design  and\nimplementation.\n27. ADB\u2019s forestry projects20 and the ongoing Upper Watershed Management Project (para.\n23) hold lessons of more general relevance: (i) local authorities should be involved early in\nproject design; (ii) local communities should be involved in project planning, implementation,\nand monitoring; (iii) trained facilitators are needed to promote involvement by local communities;\nand (iv) Government institutions must actively support participation.  Lessons from the wetland\nconservation projects supported by the Netherlands include the following: (i) action plans must\nnot be considered as rigid sets of measures; (ii) preparation and implementation of community\naction plans are unlikely to be successful without the involvement of local leaders and clearly\nvisible  benefits  to  the  community;  and  (iii)  interagency  coordination  in  conservation\nmanagement requires high-level support.  From these experiences, the most important factors\nin achieving sustainability are (i) developing awareness in local communities of the need to\nprotect resources for sustainable use by themselves and others, (ii) empowering them to act\naccordingly, and (iii) treating them as equal partners throughout the process.  Such processes\nare inherently slow, but have yielded outcomes that are both equitable and sustainable.\n28. Government attempts to promote local participation in the development process have\nhad limited success due to (i) poorly defined methods and processes, (ii) inadequately trained\nstaff, (iii) an inability to mobilize adequate technical and financial support, (iv) an unrealistic\nexpectation of quick results, (v) suspicion by local people of Government efforts to influence\nevents on private lands, and (vi) a perception of inequality between the community and the\nGovernment.  This  suggests  that  Government  agencies  may  not  be  the  most  appropriate\ninstitutions to lead a process of community strengthening that necessarily involves trust and\npartnership building. Successes have been achieved, however, by strengthening communities\ndirectly. For example, at Rekawa, a local stakeholder committee was encouraged to prepare a\nplan for resource management and aided to accomplish its own institutionalization as a means\nto guide and finance the plan\u2019s implementation. An ADB evaluation21 noted the positive role of\nNGOs and community based organizations (CBOs) in five projects in Sri Lanka, but observed\nthat the organizations were most effective when they were involved early, were adequately\nfunded, and in the case of small and local ones, were provided with capacity strengthening.\n29. This experience suggests that NGOs are more effective in building local relationships\nand  partnerships,  and  are  far  more  likely  to  be  perceived  as  allies  and  equals  by  local\ncommunities.  The effectiveness of such a process comes from the way that participatory\nplanning  and  environmental  education  empower  the  community,  and  generate  capacity  to\nmobilize technical and other resources from government agencies and elsewhere.  The main\nconstraint on the widespread adoption of this approach in Sri Lanka is limited funding.  Funding\nis often available only through projects that are limited in duration and are therefore associated\nwith abrupt endings and attempts to speed up the process of community strengthening and\npartnership building, with limited effectiveness as a consequence.\n                                                \n20  Loan 568-SRI: Community Forestry Project, for $10 million, approved on 25 March 1982; Loan 1183-SRI:\nParticipatory Forestry Project, for $10.5 million, approved on 5 November 1992.\n21  SST  99027-REG:  Special  Evaluation  Study  of  the  Role  of  Nongovernmental  and  Community-Based\nOrganizations in Asian Development Bank Projects.", "10\n2.  Integrating Conservation and Community Development\n30. Lessons drawn from ADB\u2019s integrated conservation-development projects (ICDPs)22 are\nthe following: (i) there is a complex and indirect relationship between the provision of income-\nearning alternatives for local communities and the achievement of conservation objectives; (ii) it\nis important to develop a local institutional capacity to implement stakeholder participation; and\n(iii) the project should develop an understanding within local communities regarding their roles,\nrights,  and  responsibilities  with  respect  to  natural  resources  and  biodiversity  conservation.\nThese findings were supported by a recent review of 21 ICDPs in Indonesia,23 which concluded\nthat  only  a  minority  of  the  projects  could  claim  that  biodiversity  conservation  has  been\nsignificantly enhanced by project activities.  Those that had a significant impact shared high-\nlevel political and administrative support, strong but adaptive and flexible PA management, and\nclose communication with the local government.\n31. Many of the same lessons can be drawn from the GEF portfolio of stand-alone projects.\nA  feature  of  the  GEF,  however,  is  its  emphasis  on  establishing  sustainable  financing\nmechanisms of various kinds to conserve biodiversity of global significance and it has actively\nexplored the use of trust funds and trust-like mechanisms in many countries.  A review of 13\nsuch trusts24 concluded that there are four essential conditions: (i) the issue to be addressed\nrequires a commitment of at least 10-15 years; (ii) there is active government support for a\npublic-private sector mechanism outside direct government control; (iii) there is a critical mass\nof  people  from  diverse  sectors  of  society  who  can  work  together  to  achieve  biodiversity\nconservation and sustainable development; and (iv) there is a basic fabric of legal and financial\npractices and supporting institutions (including banking, auditing, and contracting) in which\npeople have confidence.  Where these circumstances exist, as they do in Sri Lanka, formation\nof a trust-like sustainable financing mechanism will be an efficient way to achieve long-term\naims  that  depend  on  slow  processes,  such  as  community  strengthening  and  partnership-\nbuilding with conservation agencies.\nE.  The ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n32. According to ADB\u2019s Country Operational Strategy for Sri Lanka (1999), sustainable\nnatural resources management is one of the key areas for ADB involvement to ensure long-term\nsustainability of economic growth and reduce poverty. A strong emphasis on forestry, natural\nresources, and environmental management as a key feature of ADB\u2019s country operations was\nderived from the recognition that some parts of the agriculture sector are experiencing a decline\nin productivity, while intersectoral competition for water and other natural resources is emerging\nas a serious issue. Indicators, such as the incidence of human encroachment on the PAs,\ndecline in forest cover, and soil degradation indicate the growing and unsustainable imbalance\nbetween the supply of and demand for the use of natural resources. The criteria that guide\nADB\u2019s  interventions  include  (i)  achieving  a  balance  between  the  economic  and  ecological\nfunctions  of  the  environment,  (ii)  addressing  poverty-related  causes  of  environmental\ndegradation,  and  (iii)  minimizing  environmental  damage.  These  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s\n                                                \n22  Loan 1187-INO: Biodiversity Conservation in Flores and Siberut, for $24.5 million, approved on 12 November\n1992; Loan 1605-INO: Central Sulawesi Integrated Area Development and Conservation, for $32 million,\napproved on 27 January 1998; and  Loan 1351-INO: Sulawesi Rainfed Agriculture Development, for $30.36\nmillion, approved on 31 January 1995\n23  Wells, M., S.

Policy Dialogue\n33. ADB  is  actively  engaged  in  addressing  policy  issues  that  constrain  sustainable\ndevelopment in the natural resources sector.  Key areas of ongoing policy dialogue related to\nPA  management  and  biodiversity  conservation  systematically  encourage  and  enable  the\nGovernment  to  resolve  issues  of  good  governance,  accountability,  transparency,\ndecentralization, cooperation, and coordination among government and nongovernment public\nand private institutions, so as to rationalize the management of the PA system and maximize its\ncontribution to the reduction of poverty in Sri Lanka.\n1.  Strengthening the Legislative Framework\n34. The  new  National  Wildlife  Policy,  prepared  with  support  from  ADB,  commits  the\nGovernment to amend legislation, as necessary, to support the implementation of this policy.\nThus, the FFPO of 1937 will be amended to make specific provision for several policy priorities,\nincluding  participatory  PA  management  and  benefit  sharing,  ecotourism  development,\ninvolvement of the private sector, and ex situ conservation activities.  The amended FFPO will\nbe superseded by entirely new legislation before the end of project year 5, which will be\ncollaboratively developed in the light of the Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan, which will be\nprepared according to best practices during the Project.\n2.  Strengthening the Institutional Framework\n35. Biodiversity  conservation  and  PA  management  are  currently  hampered  by  weak\ncooperation among the concerned institutions, and by unclear separation of responsibilities and\njurisdictions between them. A number of coordinating bodies have been established, but they\nare of limited effectiveness and lack formal mechanisms to coordinate Government operations.\nTherefore,  ADB  is  stressing  the  need  to  reform  current  arrangements,  and  the  2000  TA\nprogram, especially the ongoing TA on Sustainable Natural Resource Management, will support\nthe Government doing so.  The new National Wildlife Policy commits MFE, MPAHA, and the\nBiodiversity Conservation Secretariat to monitor events and take actions needed to maintain\nconsistency between the National Wildlife Policy and other sector and intersector policies.  It\nalso commits the Government to promote cooperation among all stakeholders through joint\ndecision making at all levels.  These policy statements reflect a strong consensus among key\ninstitutions of the Government, as well as national NGOs, universities, and representatives of\nthe private sector.  This provides a strong basis for ADB, in dialogue with Government, to take\nthe process of institutionalizing interagency cooperation to unprecedented levels, providing the\nbasis that all the country\u2019s PAs may one day be consolidated under the management of one,\neffective Government agency.\n3.  Strengthening Institutional Capacity\n36. The new National Wildlife Policy commits the Government to provide adequate support\nto wildlife resource management, and to reorient, strengthen, and decentralize their institutions.\nThis mandate complements the Project\u2019s aim to strengthen DWLC\u2019s ability to collaborate with\n                                                \n25  R232-94:  ADB\u2019s Policy on Forestry  (Revision 1), February 1995.", "12\nother institutional stakeholders.  The implementation of the Project will (i) effect organizational\nchanges within DWLC to address issues related to good governance such as greater integration\nand  transparency;  (ii)  remove  some  of  the  key  constraints  on  staff  effectiveness  and\naccountability, including disincentives that undermine morale; (iii) facilitate the decentralization\nof operational responsibilities to the regional and field unit level, including annual work planning,\nbudgetary  responsibility,  and  accountability  for  performance;  and  (iv)  ensure  DWLC\u2019s\nparticipation in partnership-building with local communities and the local government.  These\nmeasures are consistent with the decentralizing thrust of other Government policies, and will\nrelocate significant responsibilities away from the center to encourage PA managers to operate\nin a web of partnerships with surrounding society.\n4.  Improving Protected Area-Community Relations\n37. The National Wildlife Policy commits the Government and DWLC to (i) conserve wildlife\nresources through protection, study, education, sustainable use, and participatory management;\n(ii) value the traditional knowledge of sustainable ecosystem use possessed by the people of Sri\nLanka, and incorporate this within wildlife management systems; and (iii) ensure that local\npeople are consulted in the process of decision making, actively participate in implementation,\nand receive direct benefits from the management of PAs.  The clear intention is to relieve the\noften-adversarial relationship between PA managers and the communities around PAs. This\nintention has resulted in the acceptance of a revenue-sharing agreement in which DWLC will\nretain 50 percent of all revenue collected from PAs, to be used for specified purposes including\ncommunity outreach that will be channeled through the existing Wildlife Preservation Fund.  The\nGovernment and DWLC recognize that effective protection of wildlife will not be possible without\ncommunity  involvement  in  PA  management,  benefit  sharing,  and  poverty  reduction.  ADB\ntherefore aims to encourage and enable the Government to (i) improve the quality and integrity\nof public sector management in the wildlife sector; (ii) mobilize and empower user groups; (iii)\nencourage and enable communities to obtain new and incremental resources to meet their own\ndevelopment priorities; (iv) establish lines of communication and formal agreements to allow for\nthe use of local resources to combat poverty and deprivation, and to promote the protection of\nwildlife  habitats;  and  (v)  promote  community  and  local  government  cooperation  in  local\ndevelopment planning.\n5.  Strengthening Private Sector Involvement\n38. Policy dialogue in this area aims to build systematically upon existing public-private\nrelationships through active experimentation and learning, while removing obsolete legislative\nbarriers and installing effective safeguards against abuse.  The main areas of progress are\nexpected to be in developing guidelines and rational structures for a greater range of user fees\nand concessions, especially in the area of ecotourism, in the contracting of a greater range of\nservices, and in establishing more benefit-sharing arrangements with local communities.  It is\nexpected that steady, knowledge-based evolution of best practices, followed by their more\nwidespread adoption, will be a feature of this field in the coming years. Until experience and\ngood practices are sufficiently mature, the Government will continue to move cautiously in\ninvolving the private sector inside PAs.\n6.  Promoting Ecotourism Development\n39. In this area of policy dialogue, ADB is emphasizing the need for (i) strategic planning; (ii)\njoint activities between the public and private sectors, including the community-based private\nsector; (iii) diversification and improvement of products and services offered within PAs; (iv)", "13\nbroader distribution of the benefits obtained; and (v) development of a greater variety of niche\nofferings to satisfy a wider range of potential visitors. The Government meanwhile, with ADB\nencouragement, has agreed to end DWLC management of tourist bungalows. Their subsidized\nprices inhibit private investment, managing them distracts DWLC from its primary role as the\nregulator of PA use, and DWLC is subject to pressure to provide use of the bungalows at\ncommercially  nonviable  rates  to  those  with  influence.    Other  policy  alternatives  such  as\ncommunity  leasing  of  bungalows  are  being  explored.  ADB  and  the  Project  will  promote\necotourism development through such measures as planning, training, concession agreements,\nand infrastructure investments within the PAs and outside in conjunction with local communities.\nThe Project also allows for the sharing of PA revenues with cooperating communities through\noutreach grants from the Wildlife Preservation Fund.\nG.  The Global Environment Facility\n40. The GEF provides grants to activities that resist global climate change, loss of biological\ndiversity, pollution of international waters, and depletion of the ozone layer.  It aims to meet the\nincremental costs of achieving global benefits, meaning the difference between the costs of a\nproject achieving global environmental benefits over and above the costs of an alternative\nproject that a country would have undertaken in its own interests. The GEF contribution to the\nProject is based on current understanding of the distribution of likely benefits relative to the\npriorities of the Government and its partners in development (Appendix 3).  Hence, the GEF\nsupports only those areas where global benefits are obtainable. The grant will be deployed\nespecially to support the full participation of all stakeholders in the development of community\naction plans and agreements with DWLC relating to PA and wildlife management.  It will also be\ndirected to the building of international links as a contribution to the emergence of global best\npractice  and  the  spread  and  improvement  of  replicable  models  worldwide,  and  on  the\nindependent monitoring of project impacts on wildlife survival and ecosystem integrity.\nIV.      THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.    Rationale\n41. Sri Lanka has globally significant biodiversity values that are currently threatened by\ndeforestation, land degradation, and unregulated exploitation of natural resources. The PA\nsystem is central to conserving wildlife biodiversity. PAs also play a significant role in supporting\nrural economies through watershed protection, and add to the economic and cultural values of\nSri  Lanka  through  the  provision  of  recreational,  ecotourism,  scientific,  and  educational\nopportunities. The PAs are currently unable to provide effective protection for these values due\nto several reasons, including the need for legislative and institutional reform; lack of resources,\nmanagerial skills, and technical capacity in DWLC, the government agency primarily charged\nwith administering the PA system; and lack of cooperation among the conservation agencies.\nTo address these deficiencies will require significant efforts, particularly in human resource\ndevelopment, improvement of managerial systems and technical skills, and the provision of\ninfrastructure  and  equipment.  The  development  of  greater  interagency  cooperation  is\nfundamental to this strengthening and the growth of a more strategic approach to addressing\nconservation priorities in Sri Lanka. Key tasks such as the preparation of a BCAP, achieving\ngreater representation of native ecosystems within the PA system, preparing recovery plans for\nendangered species, and establishing national conservation priorities can only be achieved\nthrough collaborative and coordinated approaches.", "14\n42. To address the threats and opportunities the PA system faces demands a reorientation\nof conservation thinking that acknowledges the mutual dependence of conservation agencies\nand  local  communities  on  each  other  to  achieve  their  respective  goals.  Effective  PA\nmanagement cannot take place in the long term without the involvement and support of the local\ncommunities. Similarly, rural livelihoods depend on a flow of natural resource benefits, many of\nwhich cannot be sustained without active protective measures. To build these partnerships\nrequires  greater  capacity  within  conservation  agencies  to  understand  and  work  with  local\ncommunities in designing programs to realize joint benefits. It also requires effective community\nempowerment  to  allow  the  communities  to  plan  for  their  own  future  and  interact  with\ngovernment agencies and the private sector as equal partners. Part of this vision will involve\nlow-impact use of PAs and their buffer zones, and the capturing of benefits by communities and\nthe private sector through ecotourism development. The key need is to strengthen the ability of\nDWLC to manage the largest part of the national system of PAs, in partnership with and in the\ninterests of local stakeholders.  Experience in many countries has shown that this is likely to be\na long process, and the Project is therefore considered the first or pilot phase of a sequence of\ninterventions  that  will  provide  the  capacity  and  management  experience  to  be  extended\nthroughout the PA system and the sector as a whole.\nB.    Pilot Project Areas\n43. The Project\u2019s pilot PAs represent a comprehensive selection of threats to biodiversity\nand ecosystem integrity, and opportunities for more effective PA management. They were\nidentified  in  close  consultation  with  major  stakeholders  in  wildlife  conservation.  The  key\nselection criteria considered the areas\u2019 significance in terms of biodiversity, ecological values,\ndegree of unsustainable and illegal exploitation, and potential for ecotourism development. The\nroot cause of most threats the selected PAs face is poverty and associated deprivation among\npeople living close to PA boundaries. The poorer households specifically pose the greatest\ndirect threat to PA resources, either by acting on their own needs for subsistence and other\nlivelihood resources, or else by being co-opted into illegal activity by outsiders.  The pilot PAs\ncan be grouped for descriptive purposes into wet-zone highland, dry-zone lowland, and arid-\nzone coastal wetland ecological regions. A detailed description of the threats and root causes in\nthe pilot PAs is presented in Appendix 4.\n44. Wet-Zone Highlands. Peak Wilderness Sanctuary (224 km2) is located in the Central\nHighlands and rises steeply from about 50 meters (m) to about 600 m from which Adam\u2019s Peak\nrises to 2,238 m.  It is one of the most valuable conservation areas in Sri Lanka, with the highest\nnumber of endemics, notably birds, reptiles, and amphibians.  Adam\u2019s Peak itself is sacred to\nfour world religions and attracts about two million pilgrims each year. Encroachment, extraction\nof timber and nontimber forest products, and gemstone mining - promoted by the lack of clear\nboundaries in harsh terrain - are continuing problems, while pilgrim visitation has a strong local\nimpact along the main access trails.  Horton Plains National Park (32 km2) includes two of Sri\nLanka\u2019s three highest peaks, but is mostly a gently undulating highland plateau at about 2,100\nm.  Most of the park is covered by dense cloud forest, with 50 percent endemism among woody\nplants including wild relatives of cultivated pepper, guava, tobacco, and cardamom.  Among the\nmammals  are  two  monotypic  kinds  of  endemic  shrews,  while  the  birds  include  numerous\nmontane endemics and wintering migrants.  Exotic plant species including gorse and black\nwattle are colonizing rapidly.\n45. Dry-Zone Lowlands. Ritigala Strict Nature Reserve (15 km2) is an isolated mountain\n(766 m) that supports over 400 plant species, 20 percent of them endemic.  More than 100 plant\nspecies are used in Ayurvedic medicines, and there are elaborate ruins of an ancient hospital", "15\nand  monastery  complex.    Mammals  include  endemic  and  endangered  purple-faced  leaf\nmonkeys and three endemic species of birds.  Logging and poaching are common, along with\nencroachment, and human-elephant conflict is increasing around the boundaries.  Wasgamuwa\nNational Park (394 km2) contains one of the largest remaining native forests in Sri Lanka, with\n150 known tree species, at least 10 of them endemic.  About 70,000 cattle and buffalo graze the\npark,  even  encroaching  on  the  southern  boundary.  Invading  woody  species  have  become\nwidespread, and hunting, gemstone mining, and firewood collection are common.  Minneriya\nNational  Park  (89  km2)  comprises  low-forested  hills  that  feed  the  third-century  Minnerya\nreservoir and the modern Giritale reservoir.  The core of the park is one of the most biodiverse\nparts of the country outside the wet zone, with a unique concentration of intact ecosystem types.\nAbout  4,000  cattle  and  buffalo  graze  the  park,  and  firewood  collection  and  poaching  are\ncommon. Human-elephant conflicts occur around at least five nearby villages.  Uda Walawe\nNational Park (308 km2) contains diverse old growth forest in the northern part, within which\nriverine  stands  contain  the  endemic,  endangered  tree Hopea cordifolia.    Among  the  rich\nmammal fauna are the endemic golden palm civet, herds of resident and migratory elephants,\nand a full suite of low-country birds.  About 30,000 cattle graze the park, exotic plants have\ninvaded many areas, and fishing and poaching are widespread.\n46. Arid-Zone Coastal Wetlands. Bundala National Park (62 km2) is Sri Lanka\u2019s only\nWetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.  It contains key nesting sites\nfor five species of marine turtle.  Arid and semiarid terrestrial habitats shelter a wide range of\nspecies, including elephants and many other native mammals, star tortoise, and an endemic\nflying snake.  The marshes and channels contain populations of an endemic toad, and both\nmugger and estuarine crocodiles. The biological productivity of the lagoons is being undermined\nby the intrusion of fresh (and polluted) irrigation water, while the park is being invaded by alien\nweeds such as prickly pear cactus, and is grazed by some 6,000 cattle and buffalo.\n C. Objectives and Scope\n47. The Project will support the Government to conserve the country\u2019s natural resources and\nbiodiversity for the well-being of current and future generations and assist the Government in\nmeeting the country\u2019s international commitments and other policy goals for conservation of\nbiodiversity.  By strengthening the institutional capacity of DWLC through the development of\nstrategic management capacity and staff skills, provision of equipment and infrastructure, and\ndevelopment of adaptive field management, PA security will be enhanced. As part of securing\nthe  resource,  the  economic  potential  of  PA-based  ecotourism  will  be  stimulated  through\nincreased technical capacity, formation of public-community and public-private linkages, and a\nprogram of ongoing product and service development that will contribute to raising the quality of\nvisitor experiences.  Durable improvement to the security of PA resources requires social\nsupport for conservation objectives. Buffer zone community empowerment along with revenue\nsharing between PAs and stakeholders will support a process of ongoing change  (Appendix 5).\n48. Ultimately, the potential value of Sri Lanka\u2019s biological resources will be achieved only if\npolicies and operational strategies are coordinated across sectors.  The Project will support a\nrange of joint forums as well as the completion of a BCAP and a cross-sector review of the total\nconservation  system  including  potential  roles  for  the  private  sector  to  assist  in  filling\nconservation  system  gaps.  The  development  and  financial  support  of  joint  forums  at  the\noperational  and  national  levels  will  provide  a  platform  for  the  future  growth  of  sector\ncoordination.  Sector coordination will also be promoted through the provision of a sustainable\nfinancing mechanism that will develop social mobilization and empowerment for buffer zone\ncommunities irrespective of sector authority (Appendix 6). The establishment of a Protected", "16\nArea Conservation Trust (PACT) outside of Government to empower communities in local\ndevelopment initiatives will ensure ongoing support to conserving PAs after project completion.\n1. Project Components\na. Enhancing Institutional Capacity for Protected Area Management26\n(Component A)\n49. DWLC\u2019s capacity will be enhanced through the provision of international and domestic\nconsulting services, internal and external training courses and study tours, provision/upgrading\nof  facilities  such  as  the  Wildlife  Education  and  Training  Center  at  Giritale  and  DWLC\u2019s\nheadquarter in Colombo, as well as materials, vehicles, and equipment. DWLC will be provided\nresources  to  build  international  partnerships  with  institutions  in  other  countries  that  have\novercome similar challenges, including Costa Rica\u2019s National Biodiversity Institute, the South\nAfrican National Parks Authority, and the Smithsonian Institution. Thus, it will have direct access\nto global best practices in ecotourism, decentralized and participatory PA management, and\nbiodiversity and environmental inventories.  Component A comprises four subcomponents.\n50. Enhancing  Management  Systems.  The  Project  will  strengthen  human  resources,\nfinancial and administrative capacity and systems to permit transparent management of DWLC.\nWork plans will be developed and implemented at the park level, within a manager line control\nsystem reporting through regional managers directly to DWLC management. Procedures for\nmonitoring work plan performance, increasing incentives and removing disincentives for staff\nperformance,  resolving  conflicts  of  interest,  as  well  as  accounting  and  budgeting  will  be\ndeveloped and training provided. The systems under this subcomponent will allow DWLC to (i)\nmonitor planned inputs and outputs at all levels of the operation on a monthly basis; (ii) achieve\naccountability  for  expenditure  and  revenue  flows;  (iii)  decentralize  decisions  about  work\nobjectives, resource needs, and work programs with agreed-upon decentralized budgets; (iv)\nprovide  access  to  a  custom-built  management  and  knowledge  information  system  via  an\ninternet and radio-based communication system; (v) access quality information both in-house\nand from other sources including the Internet; and (vi) strengthen the skills of the management\nteam through a program of change management, team building, and leadership training.\n51. Strengthening Technical Capacity. The Project will (i) provide technical training within\nDWLC  in  areas  such  as  ecology  and  habitat  management,  communications,  enforcement,\nconflict resolution, GIS, remote sensing etc.; (ii) establish a strong monitoring and evaluation\nteam that will focus on field operations and adaptive management of field programs; (iii) develop\na  participatory  research  agenda  involving  outsourcing  of  contracts  with  natural  and  social\nscientists working in tandem on wildlife biodiversity; and (iv) provide technical strengthening to\nthe  Wildlife  Health  and  Management  Unit  through  the  use  of  an  international  partnership\nprogram.  The Project will also establish and support a community outreach and extension\ntechnical team to address community and public interactions with DWLC to (i) establish at each\nof  the  field  sites  trained  capacity  to  work  with  local  communities;  (ii)  develop  operational\nprotocols  for  social  assessment,  participation,  and  local  partnerships;  (iii)  develop  public\neducation and awareness programs; and (iv) supervise local plans as an integral component of\nadaptive field management.\n                                                \n26 Component A builds on the institutional strengthening measures that were undertaken with assistance provided\nby UNDP/GEF.", "17\n52. Establishing Ecotourism Capacity. The Project will support capacity building in DWLC\nto assist in the future development of ecotourism in Sri Lanka.  Additional capacity will be\nachieved through establishing incremental staff positions, training, intersectoral workshops, and\ntechnical assistance. The Project will support DWLC in (i) working with other Government\nagencies  and  the  private  sector  to  develop  a  coordinated  strategy  for  ecotourism;  (ii)\ncoordinating the development of an ecotourism system plan and policies in support of such\nplan; (iii) providing technical and supervisory inputs to the management plans of individual PAs\non  all  aspects  of  visitor  management;  (iv)  developing  nature  interpretation  facilities;  (v)\ndeveloping concession agreements with both the private sector and local communities for the\nprovision of selective products and services within PAs; (vi) developing policies, procedures,\nand monitoring standards for assessing the performance of private sector and community-based\nconcessions;  (vii)  arranging  for  visitor  satisfaction  surveys  to  be  undertaken  on  individual\nfacilities (e.g., visitor centers), PAs, and the PA system as a whole; and (viii) reviewing pricing\nstructures for entry fees and services provided in PAs.\n53. Strengthening Wildlife Biodiversity Monitoring and Evaluation. This subcomponent\nwill strengthen DWLC\u2019s capacity to systematically monitor biodiversity in the PAs under its\nmandate. A management-driven impact monitoring program, established under the Project, is\nultimately expected to track overall national trends in wildlife resources and their utilization\nthrough site-specific monitoring. Recognizing the complex interactions between human society,\nthe  economy,  and  the  wildlife  ecosystem,  the  monitoring  program  will  concentrate  on  the\ngeneration of information that is directly applicable to the planning and management of PAs.\nInitially, the monitoring program will concentrate on developing appropriate monitoring and\nevaluation protocols in the pilot PAs and harmonizing these with the Project\u2019s management\ninformation system (MIS). Institutional development and DWLC staff training in the management\nof the wildlife monitoring and evaluation system are integral activities of this subcomponent.\nAssistance in implementing this subcomponent will be provided by a consortium of reputable\ninternational NGOs with expertise in conservation and community mobilization, and substantial\nfield-based experience in Asia.\nb.  Participatory Adaptive Management of Pilot Protected Areas\n(Component  B)\n54. Component B will support participatory management programs that address strategic\nthreats and opportunities at each of the seven pilot sites (Appendix 4).  To achieve this, the\nProject  will  support  the  (i)  consolidation  and  revision  of  existing  management  plans  into\noperational work plans and implementation of an adaptive management program to mitigate\nstrategic threats and develop opportunities; (ii) provision of new skills, infrastructure, equipment,\nand vehicles to support program implementation; and (iii) development of quality ecotourism\nproducts and services. The activities of this component are split into three subcomponents.\n55. Consolidation and Revision of Existing Management Plans and Implementation of\nAdaptive Management.  The Project will develop multistakeholder processes for reviewing the\nexisting management plans to establish priorities and work programs.  The plans developed will\n(i) specify the control of the management of PA resources; (ii) specify acceptable use of PAs\nand their resources through the application of management zoning; and (iii) outline a program of\nnecessary  facilities  and  infrastructure  required  to  support  management  and  ecotourism\ninitiatives.  Further, the plans will be used to create a rolling three-year work plan with budget\napprovals.  The  activities  are  designed  to  institutionalize  the  implementation  of  adaptive\nmanagement approaches to strategic threats at each of the pilot sites. The Project will provide\nsupport to (i) prioritize threats to each PA with involvement of local staff and stakeholders; (ii)", "18\nundertake an option analysis to specify the need for change and the range of alternative options\nto achieve it; (iii) prepare an action plan that identifies the tasks, time lines, critical success\nfactors and indicators, and reporting requirements; (iv) design a formal evaluation program; (v)\nreformulate the plan as outcomes and effects that need refocusing are identified; and (vi)\ndevelop a second full cycle to apply the technique to either reinforce the existing issues or\nalternately redirect toward the next set of priorities. Plan implementation in the selected pilot\nareas will be financed under the Project.\n56. Facilitating Management of Pilot Protected Areas. Under this subcomponent, the\nProject will provide the necessary inputs for implementation of field programs. Unmarked PA\nboundaries  will  be  delineated  and  demarcated  using  a  participatory  process.  Enforcement\ncapacity will be enhanced through (i) provision of training, (ii) developing techniques to increase\nthe probability of violators being intercepted, (iii) increasing the success rate of prosecutions\nwith appropriate sanctions, and (iv) integrating enforcement with community participation and\nthe sharing of revenues to provide positive support for boundary integrity. Furthermore, the\nProject will (i) provide equipment, vehicles, and facilities; (ii) support necessary infrastructure\nincluding low-impact access roads, tracks, and park entry facilities such as gates and reception\nareas; and (iii) extend greater field staff support including warden offices, staff quarters and beat\nbuildings. Improved community relations are central to maintaining the integrity of PAs and will\nbe supported by (i) the development of social assessment and participatory community scoping\nskills among the field unit staff; (ii) the implementation of a field-based action research program\nbased on community mobilization; (iii) the development of plans and strategies that have a\ncommunity outreach and education component; and (iv) the provision of community outreach\ngrants through DWLC staff for environmental activities, such as small-scale tree planting, local\nenvironment monitoring, and local awareness programs.\n57. Ecotourism Development. Activities under this subcomponent are designed to (i) raise\nthe capabilities of DWLC staff in visitor planning and management, (ii) enhance the quality of\nthe visitor experience, (iii) increase the involvement and capabilities of other stakeholders in the\nprovision of ecotourism opportunities, and (iv) increase local opportunities for benefit sharing\nwithout consumption of park resources. For each park, a visitor services and ecotourism plan\nwill be developed specifying (i) infrastructure requirements including visitor centers, interpreted\ntrails, observation platforms, wildlife watching hides; (ii) new recreational activities; and (iii) the\npotential for public-private and public\u2013community operations. The plan will be developed in a\nparticipatory manner as part of the park management plan. Courses will be offered in each park\nfor  upgrading  tracker  and  volunteer  guide  skills,  and  in  local  communities  for  developing\nbusiness skills for ecotourism.\nc. Collaborative Conservation Planning (Component C)\n58. Component C will establish a platform on which to develop increased collaborative\nconservation planning among the involved institutions and other stakeholders.  The Project will\nstrengthen  the  Biodiversity  Conservation  Secretariat  (BCS)  to  prepare  a  BCAP  using  a\nfacilitated  participatory  process  that  develops  a  consensus  on  national  priorities  and  a\nmechanism  through  which  increasing  numbers  of  joint  operational  programs  and  program\noverviews can be implemented. Specifically, the Project will undertake the following range of\nactivities.\n59. National Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan. The Project will strengthen the BCS\nwithin MFE to provide the focal point for completing the BCAP through provision of (i) office\nequipment, computers, and a vehicle; and (ii) access to support staff contracted for the purpose", "19\nof completing the BCAP.  The Project will also support the BCS to develop a wide participation\nprocess  using  the  following  steps:  (i)  developing  an  implementation  plan;  (ii)  organizing  a\ncommitted professional team to lead and coordinate implementation; (iii) adapting international\nguidelines to Sri Lankan circumstances; (iv) selecting representative sites and stakeholder\nparticipants; (v) using innovative procedures to optimize public participation; (vi) fostering the\nsharing of scientific and other knowledge; (vii) promoting capacity building; (viii) developing\neffective communications to expand awareness; (ix) building linkages with other initiatives; (x)\nusing  local,  national,  and  regional  expertise;  (xi)  integrating  the  process  with  sustainable\ndevelopment initiatives; and (xii) facilitating the sharing of knowledge and experience with other\ninstitutions and countries.\n60. Conservation System Review. The Project will support a process to identify lands that\nhelp fill critical gaps in the current PA system and link existing sites together.  Planning teams at\nDWLC and FD will review existing materials and jointly identify important gaps in the PA system\nand potential links between PAs.  The joint planning team will (i) formulate an action plan to\nprovide  conservation  benefits  in  the  target  areas,  (ii)  identify  and  evaluate  institutional\nconstraints  to  private  sector  provision  of  conservation  goods  and  services,  (iii)  undertake\nstakeholder  workshops  in  the  target  areas  to  identify  opportunities  for  public  land  to  be\nintroduced in the estate if such habitat fills one of the gaps, (iv) rationalize land out of the\nconservation system wherever the land is considered to have inadequate value for conservation\npurposes, and (v) develop the necessary legal documentation for private sector initiatives with\npromotional materials and a media awareness campaign.  Further, the Project will investigate\nthe potential to use public and private land to link fragmented habitats.\n61. Joint Priority Setting and Endangered Species Recovery. Numerous agencies are\nundertaking development activities in the PA buffer zones without sufficient coordination. Thus,\nthe Project will support the BCS to lead a process of joint priority setting across the major\nstakeholders  involved  in  the  biodiversity  conservation  sector  with  respect  to  buffer  zone\ncommunity support. This will involve (i) operational staff from DWLC, FD, CCD, in conjunction\nwith local authorities and other stakeholders, reviewing the existing conservation programs; (ii) a\nsector workshop to establish appropriate criteria for identification of priority sites; and (iii) joint\nassessments of priorities. These priorities will be used for evaluating funding requests under\ncomponent  D.  Under  this  subcomponent,  the  Project  will  also  support  a  collaborative\nassessment of the current status of endangered species and the preparation of endangered\nspecies recovery plans. This will involve (i) a collaborative assessment by all interested parties\nof  the  relative  endangerment  of  species  based  on  the  IUCN  red  book  classification,  (ii)\nidentification of species at risk, (iii) preparation of species recovery plans for priority species,\nand (iv) dissemination of the plan for consultation and sponsorship by the private sector.\nd. Sustainable Financing for Community Partnership Building\n(Component D)\n62. The Project will establish a trust to finance community and participatory benefits from\nconservation and the PAs, with priority assigned to projects that support PA management by\nreinforcing the link between biodiversity conservation and the local communities. The trust aims\nto empower buffer zone communities to develop increased governance over local development\nprocesses  through  the  establishment  of  participatory  local  community  plans  followed  by\nintegrated area-wide plans that assist in their implementation and thereby establish the basis for\nincreased sustainability of natural resource management. These will lead to agreements with\nPA  managers  on  local  resource  use.  For  purposes  of  this  component,  a  Protected  Area\nConservation Trust (PACT) will be established outside of Government as a new entity with a", "20\ncapital protected endowment of initially $8 million equivalent, the revenue from which will be\nused to finance the trust\u2019s objectives relating to conservation of biodiversity. The size of the\nendowment was determined from an extensive participatory needs analysis in conjunction with\na financial sustainability analysis. The PACT will be endowed under the Project over a period of\nthree years. The PACT will fund activities that will enhance the well-being of the communities in\nthe buffer zone communities while respecting the conservation function of the PAs.  Consultants\ncontracted through the project management unit (PMU) will assist in establishing the PACT\n(Appendix 6).  Once established, the PACT will be self-executing as a stand-alone entity.\n 63. The PACT will support the empowerment process in PA periphery communities by (i)\nfunding  training  to  NGOs  and  community-level  institutions  to  enable  them  to  compete\nsuccessfully for funds from the PACT, (ii) managing a competitive grants process for contractors\nwith proven abilities to facilitate the community strengthening process, (iii) providing grants with\nwhich to initiate community action plan implementation where a proposed investment is likely to\ncontribute to resolving conflicts of interest with conservation priorities, and (iv) to undertake\ncapital investments to deliver the objectives of the trust.  Besides reinvestment of a portion of\nthe PACT\u2019s income, the income will be used to finance administrative expenses, consulting\nservices, training, workshops, civil works, equipment and materials.\n2. The Role of the Global Environment Facility\n64. The Project is consistent with the strategies and principles of the GEF with respect to (i)\nconservation of biodiversity and its sustainable use, (ii) conservation of tropical forests and their\nsustainable  use,  (iii)  maintenance  of  genetic  resources,  (iv)  empowerment  of  the  principal\ngroups and local participation in environmental management, (v) national capacity building\nrelated  to  the  mainstreaming  of  biodiversity  conservation,  and  (vi)  international  linkage  for\ndeveloping best practices and promoting their worldwide replication.  The project components\nare, however, interlinked and mutually dependent, and all must be advanced simultaneously to\nachieve significant global, national, and local benefits.  The GEF will contribute to the most\nsignificant global benefits, specifically, (i) certain consulting services provided to PMU and for\nthe establishment of the PACT; (ii) a portion (50 percent) of the PACT endowment; (iii) regular\nimpact  assessments  of  the  Project  as  a  whole  by  international  NGOs;  (iv)  partnering\narrangements between the PACT and international NGOs; (v) twinning between DWLC and\noverseas  institutions;  (vi)  biodiversity-related  research  contracts;  (vii)  collaborative  sector\nplanning including completion of a BCAP and plans for endangered species, pilot actions to\nexpand and/or link the PA system; and (viii) development of adaptive management processes\nthat address specific threats in pilot PAs. Details of the role of GEF and the incremental cost\nanalysis are in Appendix 3.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n65. The total cost of the Project, including taxes and duties, physical contingencies, price\nescalation, and interest charges, is estimated at $34.7 million equivalent, comprising about\n$17.6 million (51 percent) in foreign exchange and $17.1 million equivalent (49 percent) in local\ncurrency cost. Table 1 summarizes the cost estimates; details of the project costs are in\nAppendix 7.", "21\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n66. Details of the financing plan are in Table 2.  A loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources\nin the amount of $12.0 million equivalent is proposed to finance approximately $6.6 million in\nforeign exchange costs (38 percent of total foreign exchange costs), and $5.4 million equivalent\nof local currency costs (32 percent of total local currency costs), with a term of 32 years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1 percent per year during the\ngrace period and 1.5 percent per year thereafter. The GEF will cofinance the Project through a\ngrant that will be administered by ADB.27 A memorandum of agreement will be drawn up\nbetween ADB and the World Bank (acting as Implementing Agency for the GEF grant). The\nGEF grant will be for $10.2 million equivalent: $7.0 million in foreign exchange (40 percent of\ntotal foreign exchange costs) and $3.2 million equivalent in local currency (19 percent of total\nlocal currency costs). GEF financing amounting to $4 million will be allocated to the PACT and\nthe remaining $6.2 million will finance the protection of global benefits in each of the other\ncomponents.  The Government of the Netherlands has indicated interest in cofinancing the\nPACT  in  an  amount  of  $4.0  million  subject  to  successful  bilateral  negotiations  with  the\nGovernment. Board approval for administering the amount will be obtained as soon as the\ncofinancing arrangements are firmed up. The Government will finance 45 percent of the local\ncurrency costs by contributing the equivalent of $7.7 million (22 percent of total project costs).\nThe remaining local currency costs amounting to $0.9 million will be financed in kind by the\nparticipating NGOs/CBOs and beneficiaries as part of their equity contribution for the income-\ngenerating activities.\n                                                \n27  Cofinancing is subject to the final approval of the Project by the GEF.", "22\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development Bank 6.6 5.4 12.0 35.0\nGlobal Environment Facilitya 7.0 3.2 10.2 28.0\nGovernment of the Netherlandsb 4.0 -   4.0 12.0\nGovernment of Sri Lanka - 7.7   7.7 22.0\nBeneficiaries - 0.9   0.9   3.0\n      Total      17.6          17.1 34.7      100.0\nNote:  Figures may not add up to totals due to rounding.\na Financing is subject to the final endorsement by the GEF.\nb Subject to the final agreements reached between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of the\nNetherlands\n67. The proposed level of local currency financing by ADB takes into account the uncertain\nmedium-term economic prospects of the country and the Government\u2019s inability to self-finance a\nsubstantial proportion of the investment program required to enable Sri Lanka to undergo the\neconomic  and  social  transition  to  a  higher  level  of  development  and  reduce  poverty.  The\nGovernment has recognized that there are severe limits to the extent of public sector financing\nof  the  country\u2019s  investment  program  and  has  taken  a  number  of  important  actions:  (i)\nimplementing  an  ambitious  privatization  program;  (ii)  counter-guaranteed  private  sector\nborrowing on the international capital market under ADB\u2019s guarantee scheme; (iii) securing\nsubstantial private investment in capital-intensive industries such as power supply and ports; (iv)\ninitiating an ambitious private sector development program in 2000, aiming to further privatize\nand restructure state-owned enterprises and address labor market rigidities. The proceeds from\nthe privatization program are expected to amount to about 2 percent of the Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) in 2000.\n68. Despite these actions and achievements, the overall capacity of the Government to self-\nfinance the public investment program in the coming years is expected to remain limited. The\n1999 budget deficit was 8.0 percent of GDP, an improvement on the 9.2 percent in 1998. This\noutcome  was  largely  due  to  the  lower  than  anticipated  tax  receipts  in  the  initial  years  of\noperation of the goods and services tax that was introduced in 1998, and the larger than\nanticipated outlays on capital investment. While the Government intends to reduce the budget\ndeficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2002, in 2000, it has been projected at 7.6 percent of GDP, a\nslight improvement over 1999. Therefore, continued ADB support for local cost financing is\nconsidered justified in view of the prevailing difficult country circumstances and the need for a\nsubstantial program of rehabilitation and replacement and improvement of the country\u2019s capital\nstock for it to successfully undergo the transition to a higher growth path. The proposed level of\nlocal cost financing for the Project is considered justified especially in view of the positive\nenvironmental impact that the Project is expected to have and the associated sustainable\nreduction in the level of poverty in the areas adjacent to the PAs.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Coordination Arrangements\n69. The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC) will be the Executing Agency (EA) for\ncomponents  A  and  B.  DWLC  has  enhanced  its  financial  management  capacity  since  it", "23\nintroduced expenditure controls in end-1999. The Project will assist in the strengthening of\norganizational systems to enable work program and budget allocation decision making to be\ndecentralized to the new regional offices and field units with on-site management (Appendix 8).\nA  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  established  within  DWLC.  The  PMU  will  be\nresponsible for administering, implementing, monitoring, reporting, and coordinating all project\nactivities under components A and B.  It will be headed by the director of DWLC acting as\nproject  director;  supported  by  the  additional  director,  technical  of  DWLC  acting  as  project\ncoordinator; a full-time administration officer; and by clerical, financial, and other support staff on\na  full-time  basis.  A  Protected  Areas  Management  and  Wildlife  Conservation  Advisory\nCommittee will assist the minister responsible for DWLC on the development of policy and\nlegislation, with the PMU acting as its secretariat.  The Advisory Committee will comprise\nselected members of the existing Fauna and Flora Protection Advisory Committee, the existing\nTask Force on Wildlife Conservation, the PACT board of trustees, BCS, and others chosen to\ncomplete the representation of all key stakeholders. Within the national PA system, DWLC will\nestablish seven regions, each led by a deputy director who will have the delegated authority to\nnegotiate the work programs with the managers of each field unit along with the responsibility\nfor negotiating an agreed-upon budget with each field unit in the region.  In line with increased\nautonomy, the regional and field unit managers will be held responsible for both the work plan\noutputs and the budgetary performance. At the pilot PAs, a local coordinating committee will be\nestablished,  jointly  chaired  by  the  divisional  secretary  and  the  deputy  director  of  wildlife\n(regional) with representatives from the local government, other government agencies, local\nNGOs, tourist operators, women\u2019s groups, and other stakeholders.  This committee will be\nprogressively institutionalized into the PA stakeholders planning forum and will hold quarterly\nmeetings to discuss planned activities and explore the potential for synergy with other local\ndevelopment and conservation initiatives.\n70. MFE as the country\u2019s biodiversity focal point will be the EA for component C, the\nBiodiversity Conservation Secretariat (BCS) will be the Implementing Agency to undertake the\ncross- sector activities including development of the BCAP. The BCS will form a multisectoral\nBCAP Task Force comprising all major stakeholders including representatives from civil society,\nprivate sector, and academia.  This task force will lead and coordinate the preparation of the\nBCAP, with assistance from the BCS and technical support from the Project through what is\nenvisioned to be a 2-3 year process.  The conservation system review will be under the\nsupervision of the BCS and implemented by a task force led by DWLC, comprising the existing\nplanning teams at DWLC and FD.  The task force will (i) use all existing information to identify\nimportant gaps in the PA system and potential links between PAs, including those under the\nmanagement of separate agencies, (ii) formulate an action plan to address the provision of\nconservation benefits in the target areas, and (iii) play an active role in analyzing the strengths\nand weaknesses of the PA system.\n71. The PACT will be operated by an independent board of trustees and its assets will be\nmanaged by a commercial fund manager.  The board will comprise six independent eminent\npersons and three Government  members representing DWLC, FD, CCD, respectively. The\nboard will establish a secretariat, headed by a chief executive officer with qualifications in\nadvanced  financial  management,  who  will  be  responsible  for  administering,  implementing,\nmonitoring,  reporting,  and  coordinating  all  PACT  activities.    An  overseas  commercial  fund\nmanager or management company will be contracted by the board to invest and to manage\nPACT\u2019s endowment and investment portfolio according to standards agreed upon by the board\nand acceptable to ADB. The PACT secretariat will prepare detailed operational protocols to\ngovern  contracts  between  the  PACT  and  NGOs/CBOs.  The  NGOs/CBOs  will  facilitate\npreparation of community action plans that will be used to mobilize resources.  The PACT will", "24\nprovide  technical  support  to  the  NGO/CBO  community  along  with  funds  for  completing  a\ncomprehensive community- and area-wide planning process. The PACT will also provide grants\nfor implementing the local planning proposals selectively. The focus of the grants made under\nthe PACT will be on the achievement of biodiversity outcomes through the contracting process,\nand contractors will be assessed according to the achievement of key performance indicators\n(KPIs). The KPIs are (i) poverty analysis, including participation by and empowerment of the\npoorest members of each community; (ii) environmental education leading to a consensus\nwithin the target community that environmental integrity and biodiversity are vital resources for\nits own development; (iii) analysis of conflicts of interest, facilitated negotiation of a settlement,\nand formulation of an agreement between the community and PA managers concerning their\nroles,  rights,  and  responsibilities  in  wildlife  and  PA  management;  and  (iv)  identification  of\ninvestments that address the threats to the individual PA. A more detailed description of the\noperating and implementing procedures of component D is in Appendix 6.\n72. An interagency project coordinating committee will be established within six months of\nloan effectiveness, to be chaired by the secretary of MPAHA for cooperation and liaison with\nother agencies relevant to implementation.  The committee will have representatives from the\nMinistry of Finance, National Planning and Development, Ministry of Local Government and\nProvincial Councils, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, MFE, and Ministry of\nFisheries and Aquatic Resources Development.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n73. The Project will be implemented over six years. During the first year, project activities will\nconcentrate on (i) planning all measures to strengthen DWLC, including the preparation of a\ndetailed work plan; (ii) recruiting consultants to work with the PMU, including partner NGOs to\nundertake baseline surveys, and consultants to establish the PACT; (iii) beginning the training\nprograms; (iv) screening and identifying all potential suppliers of goods and services; and (v)\nscreening NGOs for training funded by the PACT. Most of the procurement of civil works and\nother goods and services will be undertaken in the second and third years of the Project. The\nPACT will train NGOs in the second and third years.  The first NGO contracts will be awarded at\nthe end of the second year. Upon successful pilot testing of the PACT activities in the selected\npilot  PAs,  its  operations  will  be  extended  to  cover  communities  adjacent  to  other  priority\nconservation areas as identified under the BCAP. A project implementation schedule is given in\nAppendix 9.\n3. Project Review\n74. The project design will be subject to a constant review throughout implementation, and\nmechanisms have been incorporated to ensure that the design is sufficiently flexible to adapt to\na changing environment and to incorporate lessons that are being learned.  The Project will be\nreviewed twice annually.  These reviews will be undertaken jointly by the Government and ADB\nto (i) determine whether expected implementation is on track; (ii) determine whether the design\nis still appropriate; (iii) see whether outputs, effects, impacts, and benefits are being or will be\nrealized; (iv) assess the outputs and results achieved and consolidate lessons to improve their\nrealization during the remaining project period; (v) provide analytic feedback to the EAs and the\nPACT, where necessary, to justify modifications in policies, immediate objectives, institutional\narrangements,  areas  of  special  emphasis  and  resource  flows  during  the  remaining\nimplementation  period;  and  (vi)  examine  whether  the  assumptions  made  in  the  project\nframework remain valid or whether adjustments are required to ensure achievement of the\noverall objectives.", "25\n4. Procurement of Goods and Services\na.  Civil Works, Materials, and Equipment\n75. All procurement of civil works, materials, and equipment will be in accordance with\nADB's Guidelines for Procurement.  Given that the value of each civil works contract will be less\nthan $1 million and in view of the competitive nature of the construction sector in Sri Lanka, civil\nworks contracts are not expected to be of interest to international bidders.  Thus, all civil works\ncontracts will be awarded to prequalified private sector contractors under local competitive\nbidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Contracts  for  supply  of  materials,  vehicles,  and\nequipment  costing  $100,000-$500,000  will  be  awarded  through  international  shopping\nprocedures acceptable to ADB, whereas those that cost below $100,000 will be procured on the\nbasis of direct purchase.\nb. Consulting Services, NGO Services, and Training\n76. The Project will require 172 person-months of domestic and 128 person-months of\ninternational consulting services.  The GEF grant will fund 54 person-months of domestic and\n85  person-months  of  international  consulting  services.    To  simplify  project  start-up,  all\nconsultants  will  be  recruited  by  the  Government  through  a  single  contracting  process  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the\nuse of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. Consultants will be used to strengthen the\ntechnical and managerial capacity of DWLC working mostly through the technical units in the\nhead office, especially the Protected Area Management Unit within which the monitoring and\nevaluation  team  and  the  visitor  services  and  ecotourism  team  receive  considerable\nstrengthening.    The  Community  Outreach  Unit  will  also  receive  significant  technical\nbackstopping, reflecting the paucity of current skills and lack of experience of the field staff in\nthis  area.  The  consortium  of  international  NGOs  for  the  monitoring  and  evaluation\nsubcomponent will be selected by the Government from a shortlist agreed upon between DWLC\nand  ADB,  on  the  basis  of  proposals  submitted  by  the  shortlisted  organizations.  A  similar\narrangement will be adopted in recruiting the international NGO with experience in conservation\ntrust funds for the twinning arrangement with the PACT. Training will be provided by the Giritale\nTraining  Center  with  specialist  training  procured  both  locally  and  internationally  (Details  in\nAppendix 10).\n5. Accounts, Audits, and Reports\na. Accounts and Audits\n77. All agencies involved in implementation will prepare and maintain separate accounts for\nproject-related disbursements.  The PMU will consolidate the accounts from all sources and\nthen submit them to DWLC, which will review and then submit them to the Ministry of Finance\nand ADB. All project accounts will be independently audited on an annual basis.  The audit\nreport will include, among others, a statement verifying that funds disbursed by ADB against the\nstatement of expenditures (SOE) have been used as claimed.  Project accounts, together with\ndisbursement documentation, will be audited annually with all reports forwarded to ADB and the\nGovernment within 12 months of the end of each financial year.  Imprest accounts will be\nestablished by both DWLC and MFE, which will take direct responsibility for all administrative\nand  accounting  requirements  relating  to  the  operation  and  use  of  such  funds.    The  SOE\nprocedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  with  a  total  contract  value  not\nexceeding the equivalent of $100,000 and to liquidate advances covered in the imprest account.", "26\nDWLC and MFE will establish an imprest account with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.  The initial\nadvance for each imprest account will be based on the estimated expenditures for six months.\nThe imprest account and SOE procedure will be established, operated, and maintained in\naccordance with ADB procedures. Both will be audited as part of the regular audit of the\nProject\u2019s account, with financial statements and audit opinion set out separately within 12\nmonths from the end of the fiscal year. The PACT, once formed, will maintain separate financial\naccounts that will be audited annually by independent auditors.  The audited PACT financial\nstatements and annual report will be submitted to ADB and the Government within six months of\nthe end of each financial year.\nb. Reports\n78. The PMU will furnish ADB and the Government with quarterly and annual progress\nreports, and a publicly available project completion report within three months of the end of the\nProject.  The PACT secretariat will furnish the board with quarterly progress reports on PACT\nactivities, and will prepare and publish for sale to the public, at cost, an annual report that\noutlines the achievements of the previous year and proposed future activities.  Complimentary\ncopies of the annual report will go to ADB, the Government, and all members of the board of\ntrustees.  The PACT and DWLC will furnish ADB with annual reports on the progress of the\npartnership with NGOs, the effectiveness of such partnerships, and problems faced including\nrecommendations  regarding  such  problems.  GEF  grant  reporting  will  comply  with  GEF\nrequirements and will be undertaken by ADB as agreed upon by ADB and the World Bank and\ndetailed in the memorandum of agreement signed by the respective parties.\n6. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n79. Monitoring  systems  are  integral  to  the  MIS,  reporting  arrangements,  lines  of\naccountability, and incentive mechanisms to be established by the Project within DWLC.  They\nwill generate a database of organized knowledge on the performance of all aspects of DWLC.\nMonitoring and reporting arrangements will be complemented by impact assessments every two\nyears of the Project as a whole, with assistance from a consortium of two NGOs, one oriented to\nconservation and one to community development. Impact assessment will assess the status\nand trends applicable to all major resources of the pilot PAs, the suitability and sustainability of\nPA  management  and  community  strengthening  and  partnership-building  arrangements,  the\nintegrity of PA managers and the degree of stakeholder participation in resource management\ndecisions.  A publicly available report will be prepared within two months of the end of each\nassessment.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n80. The  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.    An  initial  environmental\nassessment (IEE) undertaken during project preparation concluded that the Project would be\noverwhelmingly beneficial from both an environmental and a social perspective.  The benefits\nwould come primarily from DWLC\u2019s improved capacity to plan and manage activities in and\nadjacent to PAs, in response to international and national biodiversity protection imperatives as\nwell  as  to  local  development  needs.  Few  potentially  adverse  environmental  impacts  were\nidentified.  Most are localized and of minor significance, for which mitigation measures are\nreadily available.  No project components are expected to result in major adverse environmental\nimpacts.    Adverse  impacts  due  to  the  development  and  implementation  of  ecotourism", "27\nconcession agreements were considered of potentially moderate significance.  The concessions\nwill be of a modest scale, and with the envisaged broad-based participatory planning, strong\nenforcement, and regular monitoring, the actual impacts during implementation are expected to\nbe insignificant.  The Project actively supports regular site evaluations involving both DWLC and\nwider stakeholders, which will provide an audit of local impacts. The preparation of plans to\nexpand the PA system to incorporate important new sites will follow ADB and Government\npolicies on compensation.  Support for local development proposals in buffer zones will be\ncontingent  on  the  proposals  demonstrating  that  conservation  is  a  primary  or  secondary\nobjective,  and  that  they  meet  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  requirements.\nReliance on the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d and on adaptive management practices with close\nstakeholder participation is expected to help ensure that all project activities are environmentally\nsound.  A checklist of the environmental parameters and potential impacts is in Appendix 11.\n2. Social Assessment28\n81. An  estimated  1.5  million  people  live  adjacent  to  the  PAs.  Project  pilot  sites  are\nassociated with some 192 villages with 40,000 households and an estimated 180,000 people.\nMany of these communities developed from in-migration, resulting in heterogeneous social\nstructures in terms of ethnicity and religious affiliations, while many have limited historical\nintrafamilial links. Poverty based on the Samurdhi poverty line for the pilot sites falls within the\n40-70 percent range: 22-32 percent in eastern Ude Walawe, 48-100 percent in Western Ude\nWalawe, 75 percent in Wasgamuwa, 65 percent in Ritigala, 58-90 percent in Southern Peak\nWilderness, 70 percent in Bundala, and 36-52 percent at Minneriya.   These are much higher\nthan the national average of 21 percent.  Villagers identified poverty as the root cause of illegal\nand unsustainable exploitation of resources in the PAs.\n82. The underlying cause of PA-community interaction is poverty in both direct and indirect\nterms. Through participatory rapid appraisals, the following issues were identified: (i) limited\naccess  to  land  with  secure  use  rights;  (ii)  continued  fragmentation  of  land  resources;  (iii)\nreduced access to resources including nontimber forest products, irrigation water, and drinking\nwater; (iv) limited access to markets and formal credit; (v) limited access to social infrastructure\nand services; (vi) lack of employment opportunities, which remain highly seasonal with the result\nthat many join the armed forces; (vii) increased dependence on Government welfare, resulting\nin greater opportunity for political interference; and (viii) reduced choices, leading to increased\nillegal activities.  The Project addresses these issues through the development of microplans,\narea plans, and the financing of seed grants with a strong emphasis on developing lasting\nparticipatory processes that establish collaborative decisions both within and between the PA\ncommunities.  The provision of ongoing financing of this activity through the PACT and the\ndevelopment of local NGO capacity are inputs that previous projects were unable to establish.\n83. Poverty  is  also  strongly  linked  to  the  insecure  resource  basis  and  unstable/casual\nemployment, leading the poor to work as casual laborers. They are vulnerable to co-optation in\nsupport of illicit activities such as livestock grazing, logging, poaching, and gemstone mining\nwithin the PAs, acting for low wages on behalf of organized gangs and businessmen from\nelsewhere. Through PRA exercises, villagers, especially the youth, were convinced that unity\nand cohesion among the community members to be vigilant against such illicit jobs are crucial\nto their sustainable livelihoods.\n                                                \n28  A two-phased social analysis was completed during project preparation.  Phase one involved consultations with\n30 communities to identify socioeconomic characteristics and their development aspirations.  This was followed\nby a series of detailed participatory rapid appraisal processes involving nine villages from the pilot PAs.", "28\n84. The social assessment also found that, while there are no significant gender gaps in\nterms of either social indicators or child labor issues, women still bear the burden of poverty due\nto  their  multiple  roles  as  economic  producers  and  family  caretakers.  Depletion  of  natural\nresources, especially fuelwoods, significantly affects their workload.  In several villages, women\nobserved that the amount of time needed to collect one bundle of fuelwood has doubled over\nthe last 10 years.  Although the number of female-headed households in the studied villages\nwas, on average, marginal, it was high among Muslim communities as husbands abandon\nwives  due  to  polygamy.    Female-headed  households  were  identified  as  among  the  most\ndisadvantaged  groups,  as  they  are  sole  income  earners  and  have  very  limited  access  to\nresources and information.  Further, liquor addiction, mainly of men, leads to family conflict and,\nin some cases, domestic violence. While women represent more than 90 percent of the savings\ngroup  members,  their  participation  in  community  decision-making  bodies  is  still  limited.  A\ndetailed social analysis is presented in Appendix 5.\nV.      PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.    Financial Analysis and Sustainability\n85. Project sustainability is determined in part by the Government\u2019s ability to support the\nrecurrent costs of the project-related activities. The Project will increase the operating cost of\nDWLC by $235,000 per annum simply as a result of the increased provision for staff, and\noperation and maintenance for vehicles and other equipment.  This cost is offset by the increase\nin Government revenues from tourism visitation derived from entrance fees, service charges,\nand vehicle fees and the payment of the goods and services tax.  Of all income-generating\nopportunities offered by the Project, the most significant are those related to ecotourism, which\nis a strong theme in components A, B, and D.  Revenue from ecotourism is expected to have a\nsignificant impact on the Government treasury and potentially on incomes of local communities.\nThe financial analysis of the ecotourism-related components assumes that the Government\u2019s\nprojections of foreign visitor arrivals will be achieved and maintained throughout the project\nperiod.  However, this component is financially viable even with a more conservative projection\nof foreign visitor arrivals.  The incremental benefits of the Project are derived from an increase\nin the number of foreign visitors to PAs (beginning with a 1 percent increase in year 6 of the\nProject, to a maximum of 5 percent by year 10 and thereafter), and in entrance and service\ncharges  (10  percent  increase  beginning  in  year  6).    National  visitors  to  PAs  and  the\ncorresponding entrance and service charges are also expected to increase from year 6 of the\nProject.  In addition to the direct revenue from incremental visitors and charges of PAs, the\nGovernment will earn revenue from taxes and levies on the sale of incremental goods and\nservices  developed  by  communities  in  the  support  zones  that  benefit  from  the  Project\ninterventions.  Overall, it is anticipated that the direct incremental revenue just from ecotourism\nalone could be between $1.0 and $2.3 million each year as a result of the Project.\n86. The sustainability of project interventions financed by the PACT will depend on the\nextent  to  which  communities  adopt  alternative  income-generating  activities.  Examples  of\nactivities that will benefit local communities are fenced cattle grazing, community fuelwood\nproduction, production of buffalo curd, and operation of rice storehouses.  Individual financial\nmodels of several such typical activities illustrate their financial viability.  For example, the\ncommunity fuelwood model suggests a financial rate of return of 60 percent; the cattle grazing\nmodel has a 35 percent rate of return, and the community-operated rice storehouse model\nwould have a return of 16 percent.", "29\n87. The Government has agreed to a revenue-sharing policy that allows DWLC to retain 50\npercent revenue derived from PAs.  Based on the expected increase in tourism numbers and\nthe associated revenue, the recurrent costs will be covered by the end of year 6. As such, the\nadditional recurrent costs of the Project are significantly less than the DWLC share of the\nrevenues.  From the perspective of the Government\u2019s fiscal position, the Project will have a\npositive impact based on conservative tourism growth data.\nB.    Economic Analysis\n88. The Project will generate significant economic benefits (Appendix 12).  Above all, the\nprotection provided to Sri Lanka\u2019s rich and largely endemic biodiversity provides benefits to\nsociety at local, national, and global levels.  At the local level, communities will benefit from\nemployment and improvement in living standards generated by the demand for ecotourism and\nrelated services.  Benefits at the national level include (i) the ability to cater to the ecotourism\nniche market and generate significant forward linkages within the national economy; (ii) the\nability to attract foreign direct investment in ecotourism and biodiversity-related areas; (iii) the\nability to comply with international commitments on protection of biodiversity; (iv) the option\nvalue of preserving biological resources for future exploitation, particularly for bio-prospecting\nand research; and (v) the opportunity to demonstrate effective and decentralized governance\nthrough a strengthened and better trained DWLC.  Global society will benefit from (i) enhanced\ncarbon sequestration potential of the PAs; (ii) protection of endemic species; (iii) maintenance of\nhabitats used by internationally mobile species, especially turtles and waterfowl; and (iv) less\ntangibly, from the existence value of better managed PAs in Sri Lanka.\n89. The  community  partnerships  developed  with  assistance  provided  by  the  PACT  will\ngenerate substantial economic benefits to initially about 180,000 people living in the vicinity of\nthe PAs, more than 50 percent of whom are poor.  The project interventions will benefit them in\nseveral ways, giving them (i) the ability to undertake collective planning and decision making, (ii)\nthe  ability  to  exercise  empowerment  by  obtaining  financing  for  community  development\ninitiatives, and (iii) new employment opportunities through the income-generating activities.  The\noverall impact will be an improvement in the standard of living of these people and mutually\nreinforcing  and  sustainable  interactions  with  the  PAs  and  buffer  zones  adjacent  to  their\ncommunities.\n90. The preceding benefits are largely nonquantifiable. A partial economic analysis was\nconducted  focusing  on  the  project  interventions  associated  with  ecotourism  development  -\nmainly the activities covered in components A and B of the Project.  All costs were broken into\ntheir  traded,  nontraded,  labor,  and  tax  factors  and  converted  to  import  parity  prices.  For\nnontradables, a standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to derive economic prices. A\nshadow wage rate factor of 0.81 was used to derive the economic cost of labor. Only the direct\nrevenues from ecotourism and Government taxes accruing from the sale of goods and services\ndeveloped by support zone communities were considered in the analysis. The benefit stream\nfrom national tourists was calculated on the basis of the willingness to pay for wildlife-based\nrecreational opportunities, derived from a study conducted in Sri Lanka29 in 1997. The data gave\nan economic internal rate of return estimated at 18 percent.\n                                                \n29  Silva, K.A.D.I., and H. B. Kotagama. 1997.

The Project will positively affect the lives of, initially, 40,000 households or 180,000\npeople living in 192 villages near the seven selected pilot PAs.30 The people living in rural areas\naround PAs have, on average, the least secure livelihoods in Sri Lanka.  They also have the\nleast influence on public investment, and the fewest opportunities to participate fairly in rewards\nflowing from private investment. The Project will establish mechanisms that will systematically\nassist these people.  Its strategy for social progress is both participatory and flexible, based on\nan approach that is process oriented and will be developed adaptively during the Project.  The\nProject will strengthen the target communities, and by so doing encourage and enable them to\nbecome agents of their own development and equal partners in benefit-sharing arrangements.\n92. Benefits will flow from the capture of incremental resources by communities that are\nbetter able to articulate their development priorities to potential funding agencies and investors.\nAbout 200 communities in the pilot areas will undergo the PACT action-planning process during\nthe Project, with a steady increase in scope and impact thereafter due to the permanent nature\nof the PACT and the irreversible effects of environmental education, partnership building, and\ncommunity empowerment.  Other local benefits will arise from project activities that promote\necotourism, attract additional visitors, and increase the demand for accommodation, guides, and\nother goods and services.  The resulting, cumulative social benefits in the areas around PAs will\nbe  widespread,  and  targeted  to  the  most  needy.  While  the  Project  does  not  include  a\ncomponent specifically targeting women, the facilitating NGOs/CBOs will be trained in such a\nway  as  to  ensure  equal  benefits  and  participation  for  men  and  women.    Female-headed\nhouseholds will be targeted as part of the most needy groups.\n93. The interests of broader society will be served by the Project in several more general\nways.  First, the Project will promote the grassroots skills and relationships that are needed to\nmake decentralized systems of governance work for people, thus reinforcing and improving the\neffect of a wide range of Government policies.  Second, nature-based recreational opportunities\nwill multiply and directly benefit the hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans who currently crowd\nthe tiny number of available facilities each year.  Third, better-run and better-equipped PAs will\nprovide many new opportunities for educational visits by schoolchildren and university students.\nFinally, improved arrangements for ecological and biodiversity research will allow more of the\nnation\u2019s biological wealth to be documented and used sustainably to diversify the Sri Lankan\neconomy and further enrich its culture.\nD.    Impact on Poverty\n94. The Project is not intended directly, quickly, and on its own to lift large numbers of\npeople out of poverty. Instead, it will complement direct transfers to the poor by strengthening\nthe ability of their communities to mobilize and use new resources from a wide range of\ngovernment and nongovernment grant, credit and public investment programs, and those from\nother funding agencies.  By promoting the cohesion and articulacy of target communities,\nproviding them with a powerful governmental ally through partnership with DWLC, and forums\nfor making their case to divisional secretaries and other powerful decision makers, it is expected\nthat  both  their  overall  economic  efficiency  and  ability  to  capture  investments  will  increase\nmarkedly.   This will be added to the effect of some direct employment, but more significantly to\nthe  impact  of  extra  opportunities  for  employment  and  self-employment  associated  with\n                                                \n30  The surveys undertaken in the pilot PAs during project processing did not detect any communities living within\nthe PAs.  Therefore, no resettlement is envisaged under the Project.  Should, however, resettlement become\nnecessary during project implementation, ADB safeguard policies in this regard will apply.", "31\nincreased visitor flows, and investment by the Project and the private sector in ecotourism\ndevelopment.\n95. The Project\u2019s beneficial impacts on poverty and deprivation among local people are\nexpected to flow mainly from (i) 25,000 person-days of direct employment at DWLC as laborers;\n(ii)  increased  employment  from  private-sector  investment  in  ecotourism  operations  in  and\naround  PAs;  (iii)  increased  opportunities  for  self-employment  by  local  people  in  providing\necotourism services; (iv) increased income from the sale of handicrafts and other goods and\nservices to visitors; (v) implementation of environmentally sound community activities funded by\noutreach grants from PA managers and grants from the PACT; (vi) relief of the human-elephant\nconflict, including reduced incidence of damage to life and property and speedier settlement of\ncompensation claims; and especially (vii) increased social cohesion and communal ability to\nmobilize resources that are available from the Government and other sources to meet newly\narticulated community development needs.  The overall effect of the Project is expected to be\nprofoundly enriching for the poorest and least powerful members of local society.\nE.    Risks\n96. The Project risks are (i) prolonged implementation delay due to inadequate availability of\na counterpart budget and the limited capacity of the EAs, (ii) inadequately addressed beneficiary\ninvolvement,  (iii)  inadequate  law  enforcement  within  PAs,  and  (vi)  lack  of  political  and\nbureaucratic support.  To minimize these risks, the project design (i) takes into account the fact\nthat DWLC has already been strengthened by UNDP/GEF; (ii) promotes benefit-sharing, direct\nand  indirect  employment,  and  capacity  building  in  and  partnerships  with  local  society;  (iii)\ncontains a pilot investment process; (iv) promotes interagency cooperation to reduce planning\nfailure, and will address underlying ecological and social problems whatever their origin; (v)\npromotes strong, adaptive, and flexible PA management and stronger enforcement capabilities;\n(vi) promotes consistent national support by DWLC and other agencies, including policy and\nlegislative development; (vii) allows for exposure to international experience among selected\ngovernment  and  nongovernment  institutions;  and  (viii)  mandates  regular,  independent,\ncomprehensive, and public impact assessments.\nVI.      ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n97. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Within one year of loan effectiveness, the Government will have prepared and\nsubmitted to Parliament a bill for wildlife conservation, amending the Fauna and\nFlora Protection Ordinance in accordance with the National Wildlife Policy of\n2000.\n(ii)  The  BCS  within  MFE  will  form  a  multisectoral  task  force  comprising  expert\nmembers to develop a BCAP, consistent with the National Wildlife Policy of 2000\nand  reflecting  the  concerns  of  all  relevant  government  and  nongovernment\nstakeholders.    The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  BCAP  will  have  been\nprepared and published within three years of loan effectiveness.", "32\n(iii)  No  disbursements  for  component  D  of  the  Project  will  be  made  until  (a)\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  have  been  made  with  one  or  more\ncofinanciers, in addition to GEF, for the contribution of an amount equivalent to at\nleast $4.0 million to the Protected Area Conservation Trust (PACT), and (b) the\nPACT  will  have  been  established  in  a  form  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  the\nGovernment and a board of trustees and/or board of directors, as the case may\nbe, acceptable to ADB will have been appointed.\n(iv)  The  Government  will  refrain  from  any  action  that  may  interfere  with  the\nindependence of the PACT.\n(v)  The Government will ensure that, to the extent allowed under the laws of Sri\nLanka, relief from any taxes and levies will be granted in respect of the funds of\nthe PACT, including income earned on such funds, and any assets of the PACT.\nIn the event of a change in the law that would adversely affect the tax regime\napplicable to the PACT, the Government will make its best efforts to assist in\nrestructuring  the  PACT  in  such  a  way  that  its  holdings  and  income  earned\ntherefrom will not be subject to any taxes and levies.\n(vi)  The Government will cause at least 50 percent of the revenues generated by\nDWLC\u2019s PAs to be transferred to the Wildlife Preservation Fund for the purpose\nof  (a)  capital  expenditures  of  DWLC,  (b)  community  awards  and  outreach\nprograms of those communities that reside in the PAs impact zone; (c) DWLC\nstaff incentives and awards; (d) casual wages and field staff allowances; and (e)\nfinancing the elephant damage compensation program, until it has been replaced\nby an appropriate insurance scheme.\n(vii)  DWLC  will  maintain  one  separate,  interest-bearing  account  for  the  Wildlife\nPreservation Fund and will channel all revenues for and expenditures from the\nWildlife Preservation Fund exclusively through this account.  The Government\nwill have this account audited annually by independent auditors.\n(viii)  Within  one  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  DWLC  will  establish  and  commence\nimplementation of a system to delegate the authority and responsibility for the\npreparation and management of annual work plans and related budgets for the\nfield programs to the regional offices and protected area field units, under the\nsupervision  of  the  additional  director,  technical.  Within  three  years  of  loan\neffectiveness, the heads of regional offices will have the level of deputy director.\n (ix) The Government will appoint all new permanent wildlife guards and temporary\nlaborers to be stationed in a pilot PA from among people residing within five\nkilometers of the boundaries of the same area.\n (x) The Government will ensure that annually, DWLC prepares a report on national\nwildlife status and trends and that this report will be publicly available.\n(xi) Within six months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have engaged a\nconsortium  of  international  NGOs  acceptable  to  ADB  to  undertake  baseline\nsurveys in the first year and independent impact assessments in the third and\nsixth years of the Project.", "33\n(xii) Within  two  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  DWLC  will  have  commenced  the\nimplementation  of  contracts  with  local  communities/private  sector  for  their\nenvironmentally low-impact operation of all DWLC tourist bungalows retained for\ntourist purposes.  Such contracts will be on an arm\u2019s-length basis and on terms\nand conditions satisfactory to the Government and ADB.\n(xiii)  DWLC  will  prepare,  through  a  fully  participatory  process  involving  the  local\ncommunities - both men and women -  an operational plan to survey, delineate,\ndemarcate, and map the boundaries of the pilot PAs. The boundaries will be\nestablished  in  such  a  way  that  no  existing  villages  would  lie  within  the  PA\nboundaries. To the extent that there would be a need to relocate people living\nwithin  the  boundaries  of  a  pilot  PA,  DWLC  will  prepare  and  implement  a\nresettlement plan in accordance with the ADB Handbook on Resettlement and\nsatisfactory to ADB.\nB. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n98. Prior to loan effectiveness, the following will be completed:\n(i)  The Government will have established the PMU with the director of DWLC as\nproject director, and the additional director, technical as project coordinator; and\nappointed administrative, financial, clerical, and other support staff required to\noperate the PMU.\n(ii)  The Government will have established a separate, interest-bearing account for\nthe operation of the Wildlife Preservation Fund and will have transferred all\nmonies belonging to the Wildlife Preservation Fund into that account.\n(iii)  The GEF grant will have been approved by the GEF.\nVII.      RECOMMENDATION\n99. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve (i) the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 8,997,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the\nProtected  Area  Management  and  Wildlife  Conservation  Project,  with  a  term  of  32  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter and such other terms and\nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement\npresented to the Board; and (ii) if GEF approves the provision to the Government of the\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka of a grant in an amount not exceeding the equivalent\nof $10,200,000 for the Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project, the\nadministration by ADB of this grant.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n04 September 2000", "34\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Project Framework 35 1, 2\n2 External Assistance 38 8, 25\n3 The Role of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in the 39 13, 40\nProject\n4 Pilot  Protected  Areas,  Analysis  of  Threats  and  Root 44 14, 43\nCauses, and the Adaptive Threat Management Process\n5 Social Assessment and Strategy 49 15, 47\n6 Protected Area Conservation Trust 56 15, 48\n7 Detailed Cost Summary 59 20, 65\n8 Department  of  Wildlife  Conservation  Organizational 61 22, 69\nDiagram\n9 Implementation Schedule 62 24, 73\n10 Consulting  Services,  Partnerships,  Project  Impact 63 25, 76\nMonitoring, and Capacity Building\n11 Checklist of Environmental Parameters and Potential 69 26, 80\nImpacts\n12 Financial, Sustainability and Economic Analyses 71 28, 88\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA Detailed Terms of Reference for Consultants\nB Partnership Building Processes\nC Project Alternatives Considered and Rejected\nD Ecotourism\nE Summary Initial Environmental Examination\nF Initial Environmental Examination\nG Synthesis of Issues from Social Assessments\nH Detailed Cost Tables\nI Revenue Sharing\nJ STAP Review and Response\nK GEF Project Brief", "35\nAppendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\n1.

Broad Development Objective\n1. Sri Lanka is a small (65,610 square kilometers [km2]) but biologically rich tropical island,\nthe ecosystems of which sustain important irrigation and hydropower facilities against floods,\nlandslides, soil erosion, and siltation, and contain abundant biodiversity resources that provide\nnumerous use values (e.g., in tourism and traditional medicine) as well as option, bequest and\nexistence values.  The protected area (PA) system comprises 143 units totaling 9,700 km,2 or\n15 percent of land area, of which 73 units (85 percent by area) are managed by the Department\nof Wildlife Conservation (DWLC).  The Project\u2019s development objective is to conserve wildlife\nbiodiversity and to help protect the key elements of Sri Lanka\u2019s environmental infrastructure,\nand thus avert national economic losses and improve local livelihoods.  Key performance\nindicators (KPIs) include (i) reduced rates of ecosystem exploitation, depletion and loss of\nbiodiversity; and (ii) establishment of strong and adaptive systems to reduce poverty, strengthen\ncommunities  near  PA  boundaries,  manage  PAs,  and  build  and  maintain  interinstitutional\npartnerships.\nB.  Rationale for GEF Involvement\n2. Sri Lanka is considered to be the most biodiverse country in Asia per unit area, and is\npart of a global biodiversity hot spot.  About half of all its native species are endemic, including\nall freshwater crabs, 90 percent of amphibians, 25-75 percent of reptiles and invertebrates\ndepending on taxon, around 50 percent of freshwater fishes, 26 percent of flowering plants, 14\npercent of mammals, and at least as many nonmigrant birds.  Species richness is extreme, and\nthe island also provides critical habitat for many internationally mobile species, including 5\nspecies of endangered marine turtle, about 100 species of waterfowl, and many other migratory\nbirds. This wild biodiversity is complemented by genetic resources of cultivated and other useful\nplants, with hundreds of distinct varieties of rice, pepper, cardamom, betel, grain legumes, root\nand tuber crops, vegetables of the Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae, and fruit crops including\nbanana, mango, and citrus.\n3. The Project\u2019s global biodiversity objective is to protect ecosystems with high levels of\nspecies richness and endemicity by relieving the threats to them and associated root causes of\npoverty, planning failure, alien weed invasions, and institutional weakness, and hence to avert\nsignificant erosion of global biodiversity.  Relevant KPIs include (i) establishment of an effective\nprocess  to  encourage  and  enable  rural  communities  close  to  PA  boundaries  to  seek\nenvironmentally sustainable development; (ii) enhancement of DWLC\u2019s institutional capacity to\nmanage PAs; and (iii) institutionalization of new processes for dialogue, partnership-building,\nand benefit sharing among PA communities, PA managers, and natural resource management\ninstitutions.\n4. Global benefits from the Project will flow from (i) survival of endemic lineages, species,\nand higher taxa that would otherwise go extinct; (ii) survival of ecosystems that are under threat\nelsewhere; (iii) maintenance of populations of internationally mobile species, including migrant\nbirds  throughout  Eurasia  and  marine  turtles;  (iv)  development  and  testing  of  replicable\nconservation process models1 of direct relevance to other GEF-supported initiatives throughout\nthe world; and (v) enhanced international linkage and shared learning among conservation\nagencies and nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\n                                                \n1  Sri Lanka is the most densely populated country among the biodiversity hot spots.", "40\nAppendix 3, page 2\n5. These global benefits are mostly unquantifiable, but are highly significant owing to (i) the\nhigh prevailing levels of species richness and endemicity within Sri Lankan ecosystems; (ii) the\ndiversity of these ecosystems and the relatively soluble nature of threats to them; (iii) the large\nnumbers  of  migrating  birds  and  nesting  turtles  observed  routinely  in  Sri  Lanka;  (iv)  the\ninnovative and holistic nature of the project design, and its integration with emerging policy and\nlaw; and (v) the eagerness of Sri Lankan conservationists to interact with selected foreign\ninstitutions and the mutual relevance of their experience.\n6. The  Project  is  compliant  with  the  GEF  Operational  Strategy  in  the  focal  area  of\nbiodiversity, and will contribute positively to all relevant operational programs, specifically those\non arid and semiarid ecosystems (OP1), coastal, marine and freshwater ecosystems (OP2),\nforest ecosystems (OP3), and mountain ecosystems (OP4).  The Project fully agrees with the\nGEF aims of (i) conserving biodiversity and tropical forests, (ii) reducing net greenhouse gas\nemissions,  (iii)  maintaining  genetic  resources,  (iv)  empowering  the  principal  groups  and\npromoting local participation in environmental management, (v) building national capacity to\nmainstream  biodiversity  conservation,  and  (vi)  developing  international  best  practices  and\npromoting their worldwide replication.  The various components of the Project are, however,\ninterlinked  and  mutually  dependent,  and  need  to  be  advanced  simultaneously  to  achieve\nsignificant global, national, and local benefits.  The GEF will therefore contribute to all project\ncomponents, but GEF resources will be allocated to investments linked directly to the most\nsignificant global benefits and where intergenerational equity is expected to be derived.\n7. The GEF grant will finance (i) consulting services to the Project Management Unit and\nthe Protected Area Conservation Trust (PACT); (ii) 50 percent of the trust endowment; (iii)\npartnering arrangements for capacity building and performance monitoring between the PACT,\nDWLC,  international  NGOs,  and  overseas  institutions;  (iv)  biodiversity-related  research\ncontracts; (v) pilot actions to expand and de-fragment the PA system; and (vi) pilot actions to\nestablish adaptive management as the norm to address specific threats. The Project addresses\nserious  threats  to  globally  important  ecosystems  and  biodiversity  resources.    Although\ncommitted to conserving these resources, the main priority of the Government is economic\ndevelopment  to  fund  a  fiscal  deficit  and  generate  additional  employment  opportunities.  In\naddition, it is in the national interest to attain sustainable levels of natural resource use within\nPAs and benefit sharing with local populations to reduce the incidence of poverty. The GEF will\nsupport activities that are incremental to these objectives.  In particular, it will contribute to\nstrengthening DWLC to the point where protected ecosystems can be managed effectively and\nconsistently  with  global  biodiversity  objectives  in  mind,  thus  enabling  the  Government  to\nstrengthen its long-term capacity for biodiversity management.  Within the seven pilot PAs, GEF\nsupport will help ensure the consolidation and protection of ecosystems that include areas with\nthe highest possible priority from a global biodiversity perspective.  The pilot sites will also be\nused, with GEF support, to validate and field-test new management, partnership building, and\nbenefit-sharing arrangements for replication throughout the PA system, including a strategically\nvital,  long-term  process  of  environmental  education,  community  strengthening,  and  conflict\nresolution that is required to address the root causes of biodiversity loss in Sri Lanka.\n8. Outside  the  pilot  sites,  GEF  support  will  help  ensure  that  global  biodiversity\nconsiderations are incorporated within a range of strategic activities, including innovative efforts\nto expand and de-fragment the PA system in the highly biodiverse wet zone, to prepare and\nimplement plans for the recovery of endangered species and to undertake an inclusive process\nto prepare a Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan.  These will be the first processes, agreed to\nby both sides, to build operational partnerships between DWLC and the Forest Department.\nThus, GEF support will allow full participation of all stakeholders in finding the best ways to", "41\nAppendix 3, page 3\nconserve biodiversity while maximizing sustainable resource use.  Finally, GEF will support a\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  that  operates  at  the  two  independent  levels  of  project\nspecificity and PA specificity.  Most global benefits of the Project are consequences of the\nnational and local benefits being achieved, but by themselves the latter do not necessarily justify\na loan for a project of the scale, priority and duration that is needed.  This dilemma can be\nresolved through partnership, in which the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) involvement will\nunlock global environmental benefits that would not otherwise be available to the GEF project\nportfolio  of  national  and  local  benefits,  and  vice  versa.    Despite  the  commitment  of  the\nGovernment to biodiversity conservation, it is unlikely that complementarity of national and\nglobal concerns and investments can be mobilized against current threats without a direct GEF\ngrant.\nC.  Quantification of GEF Contribution\n9. Business as Usual (BAU) Baseline.  The BAU baseline assumes continued investment\nat approximately current levels by Government and aid agencies in DWLC and ecosystem\nprotection.  It assumes continued institutional weakness and isolation by DWLC, so there is no\nreason to expect that, without the Project, the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of 1937\nwill be amended or replaced, that the National Wildlife Policy of 2000 will be implemented, or\nthat DWLC will decentralize genuinely or begin to cooperate with other government agencies,\ncommunities, NGOs, or with private enterprise.  Under these circumstances, there would be\ncontinuing erosion of ecosystem resources within PAs, and continuing erosion of support for\nPAs among the people living around them. DWLC would continue in a demoralized, reactive\nmode.  Meanwhile,  irreversible  damage  would  be  done  to  the  ecosystem  and  biodiversity\nresources.  Implementation of the BAU baseline over the six years of the Project is expected to\ncost approximately $46 million.\n10. Sustainable Development (SD) Baseline.  The SD baseline adds to the BAU baseline\ncontinued  investment  by  Government  and  aid  agencies  in  environmental  education  and\ncommunity development around protected areas, and sustainable development initiatives in\nsupport of this.  The level of such additional investment is assumed to include the relevant ADB\nloan component of the Project, since this is justified by the national interest and would be\nexpected to attract Government financing.  Under the circumstances, there would be only weak\ncapture of global benefits owing to the failure to interlink local, national, and global concerns,\nand  priorities  and  interests,  with  a  consequent  loss  of  complementarity,  synergy,  and\ninternational relevance.  Implementation of the SD baseline over the six years of the Project is\nexpected to cost approximately $64 million\n11. GEF Alternative.  The GEF alternative scenario adds to the BAU and SD baselines\nthose activities that are designed to achieve the Project\u2019s global biodiversity objectives, and that\nare expected to generate global benefits.  Implementation of the GEF alternative scenario over\nthe six years of the Project is expected to cost approximately $80 million.\n12. Incremental Cost of GEF Alternative.  The estimated cost of the BAU baseline is\n$46.31 million, that of the SD baseline is $64.19 million, and that of the GEF alternative is\n$79.96 million, resulting in an incremental cost of $15.77 million (Table A3).  The GEF is asked\nto fund $10.2 million of the project cost.", "42\nAppendix 3, page 4\nTable A3:  Incremental Cost Matrix\nArea Relevant to the Cost Cost ($ Domestic Global\nProject Category million) Benefit Benefit\nComponent 1: Enhancing Institutional Capacity for Protected Area Management\nA.

Introduction\n1. The following paragraphs summarize the nature of the pilot protected areas (PAs), which\nare listed in descending order of global biodiversity value. The analysis of PA threats follows with\na description of root causes, and the project response to them. The flow chart describes the\nadaptive threat management process that will be applied by the Project.\nB.  Pilot Protected Areas\n2. Peak Wilderness Sanctuary (22,380 hectares [ha]).  Located in the Central Highlands,\nPeak Wilderness rises steeply from about 50 meters (m) in the southern lowlands, to 600 m from\nwhich Adam\u2019s Peak rises to 2,238 m.  It is one of the most valuable conservation areas in Sri\nLanka, with the high numbers of endemics, notably birds, reptiles, and amphibians.  Adam\u2019s Peak\nis sacred to four world religions and attracts about 2 million pilgrims each year. Management\npriorities include marking the remaining boundary and defending against encroachment, and\nestablishing infrastructure in response to the long shape and divided access of the PA.  Access\npaths and the summit of Adam\u2019s Peak need interpretation materials and supervision by DWLC\nstaff.  Biodiversity inventories are needed to support education, monitoring, and bioprospecting.\n3. Horton Plains National Park (3,160 ha).  The park has two of Sri Lanka\u2019s three highest\npeaks, but is mostly a gently undulating plateau at about 2,100 m.  Most of the park is covered by\ndense cloud forest, with 50 percent endemism among woody plants, and including wild relatives\nof cultivated pepper, guava, tobacco, and cardamom.  Among the mammals are two monotypic\ngenera  of  endemic  shrews.    The  birds  include  numerous  montane  endemics  and  wintering\nmigrants. The park is a popular destination for visitors, and represents a major opportunity for\npublic education. Exotic plant species including gorse and black wattle are colonizing the park.\nManagement priorities include managing visitors to reduce their impacts and increase the value\nof their presence to the park and themselves.  Equipping the park\u2019s visitor center is a high priority,\nand interpretation facilities will be provided along the paths to World\u2019s End and Baker\u2019s Fall, and\non new, signed nature trails.\n4. Ritigala Strict Natural Reserve (1,528 ha).  Ritigala is an isolated mountain that rises\nfrom the north-central lowlands to 766 m.  Varied growing conditions support over 400 plant\nspecies, 20 percent of them endemic, 3 known only from this site, and at least another 8 being\nextinct elsewhere.  More than 100 plant species are used in Ayurvedic medicines, and there are\nelaborate ruins of an ancient hospital and monastery complex.  Mammals include endemic and\nendangered purple-faced leaf monkeys, while the birds include three endemic species.  The\ncombination  of  ecosystem  diversity,  species  richness  and  endemism,  ethnobiological  and\narchaeological interests, and location within the Cultural Triangle all make Ritigala SNR a unique\nresource  for  education  and  ecotourism,  with  good  potential  for  developing  village-based\necotourism.  Logging and poaching are common, and there are areas of encroachment.  Human-\nelephant conflict is increasing near the boundaries, and the large numbers of visitors create\nlittering  and  other  problems  as  well  as  opportunities  for  more  productive  management.\nManagement priorities include providing better services for visitors, and facilities and equipment\nfor DWLC staff.\n5. Bundala National Park (6,216 ha).  The park is Sri Lanka\u2019s only site designated Wetland\nof International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.  It contains key nesting sites for five\nspecies of marine turtle.  Arid and semiarid terrestrial habitats shelter a wide range of species,\nincluding elephants, many other native mammals, star tortoise, and an endemic flying snake.\nThe marshes and channels host populations of an endemic toad, and both mugger and estuarine", "45\nAppendix 4, page 2\ncrocodiles.    Given  its  concentration  of  waterbirds  and  turtle  nesting  activities,  there  is\nconsiderable scope for ecotourism at the park.  Waterbirds depend on the biological productivity\nof the lagoons, but that, however, is being undermined by the intrusion of freshwater. The park is\nalso being invaded by exotic species, and is subject to grazing by 6,000 cattle and buffalo.\nManagement priorities include solving the underlying ecological problem of freshwater intrusion,\neradicating  invasive  weeds,  excluding  livestock,  and  protecting  turtle  nesting  beaches.\nEcotourism interventions include improving visitor infrastructure and further development of local\nnongovernment organization and villager interest in turtle conservation.\n6. Wasgamuwa National Park (39,385 ha).  The park lies in the central lowlands, and\ncontains one of the largest remaining native forests in Sri Lanka, with 150 known tree species, at\nleast 10 of them endemic and 3 of these being economically important.  The known fauna\ncomprises 23 species of large mammals, 163 birds (8 endemic), 35 reptiles (7 endemic), 15\namphibians, 17 freshwater fishes, and 52 butterflies (9 endemic).  The park probably contains\nmore wildlife, in terms of species richness, than any part of the Mahaweli region, and offers major\nopportunities for tourism use.  Gem fields left numerous deep pits.  An estimated 60,000 domestic\ncattle and 7,500 buffalo graze in the park. Encroachment of the southern boundary is heavy, and\nabout 2,400 ha of natural habitat has been lost as a result.  Invading woody species have\nbecome widespread.  Local incomes are supplemented by fishing, livestock, and sale of firewood,\nand all parts of the park are under pressure from about 30 villages that settled near the park in\n1980 .  Gemstone mining and encroachment create enforcement issues. Other priorities include\neliminating livestock grazing, eradicating invasive plants, and resolving human-elephant conflicts.\n7. Minneriya  National  Park  (8,889  ha).    The  park  lies  in  the  dry  northern  plain,  and\ncomprises low forested hills that feed the third-century Minnerya reservoir and the modern Giritale\nreservoir.  The core of the park is one of the most biodiverse parts of the country outside the wet\nzone. It contains a unique concentration of intact ecosystem types that support populations of\nmost dry-zone mammals, including elephants and leopards, while the lakes support a wide\nvariety of waterfowl and at least 31 species of native fish.  There is considerable potential for\ntourism as the park is located along a high visitor flow route in the cultural triangle. The park has\nan elephant population and scenic landscape around the reservoirs. It is grazed by an estimated\n4,000 cattle and buffalo (owned by 15-20 families). Some firewood collection and poaching take\nplace in the park, and human-elephant conflicts occur around at least five villages.  Management\npriorities include a process to eliminate livestock grazing that takes the park\u2019s history of legal\ngrazing into account, and development of tourism facilities.\n8. Uda Walawe National Park (30,821 ha).  Located in the southern lowlands, much of the\noriginal semideciduous monsoon forest was cleared by shifting cultivation. Diverse old growth\nforest is restricted to the northern part of the park, within which riverine stands contain the\nendemic, endangered tree Hopea cordifolia.  Among a rich mammal fauna are the endemic\ngolden palm civet, herds of resident and migratory elephants, and a full suite of low-country birds.\nSome 30,000 cattle graze in the park, thus complicating the resolution of the human-elephant\nconflict and impacting the park\u2019s ecosystems and tourism potential.  Exotic plants have invaded\nmany areas, and fishing and poaching are widespread.  A priority is to fence an elephant corridor\nto allow secure migration between Uda Walawe and Lunugamvehera National Park.  The Project\nwill also support the development of ecotourism facilities at the existing elephant rehabilitation\nand reintroduction facility at Uda Walawe.", "46\nAppendix 4, page 3\nC.

Methodology\n1. Social assessment of the Project comprised two phases: (i) an initial social assessment\nas part of the feasibility study covering 30 villages, and (ii) detailed community and stakeholder\nconsultations using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques in nine villages1 in seven\nproject pilot protected areas (PAs) and one PA outside the Project (40-100 participants per\nvillage).  The objectives were to (i) identify the socioeconomic characteristics of the villages near\nthe PAs; (ii) understand the nature of the relationship between the villages and the PAs; (iii)\nidentify the vulnerable groups within the villages who are either dependent or have an impact on\nthe PAs; (iv) identify the development priorities of the villagers in relation to wildlife management\nwithin  and  outside  the  PAs;  and  (v)  identify  stakes  and  perceptions  of  key  stakeholders\nregarding  PA  management  (e.g.,  Department  of  Wildlife  Conservation  (DWLC)  officers,\nadministrative  officers  at  Divisional  Secretariat, Pradeshiya Sabha  or  a  political  body  at\ndivisional level, and nongovernment organizations [NGOs]) including perceptions of the conflicts\nof  interest  between  the  villagers  and  the  PA  managers  (DWLC).  A  series  of  consultative\nworkshops were held with DWLC staff  at headquarters and the regional offices.\nB.  Socioeconomic Profiles of the Communities Near the Project PAs\n1.  Demographic Profiles\n2. The communities surrounding (i.e., within 5 kilometers of PA boundaries) the seven pilot\nPAs under the Project include 192 villages (Grama Nilahari Divisions) in 17 divisions, eight\ndistricts covering five provinces, inhabited by about 40,000 households or 180,000 people. This\ncovers more than 10 percent of a 1.5 million population living near the PAs nationwide.  For\neach PA, more than one division, district and sometimes province are involved; hence close\ncoordination is required across different administrative boundaries.\n3. The  average  households  in  the  villages  have  4.0-4.6  members.  Sociocultural\ncharacteristics  vary  across  villages.    District-level  data  shows  that  ethnic  and  religious\ncompositions  are  diverse.  The  eight  project  PA  districts  comprise  six  Buddhists  majority\ndistricts,  one  Hindu  majority  district,  and  one  Muslim  majority  district.  The  male/female\ncomposition of the population is near equal.  The female-headed households are few, except for\nthe Muslim village (Palupitiya) in Wasgamuwa where 15 percent of households are headed by\nwomen mainly because of polygamous relationships.  The educational levels of males and\nfemales are generally equal, with relatively high enrollment rates. Child labor does not appear to\nbe a crucial issue in the areas.\n2.  Poverty and Livelihood\n4. Socioeconomic  characteristics  vary  significantly  between  villages.    However,  the\nincidence of poverty in villages near PAs is higher than the national average.  The 1996/97\nConsumer Finance Survey shows poverty incidence as 19 percent at the national level and 20\npercent rural, 18 percent estate and 11 percent urban. Most villages near PAs are rural, with a\nfew in the estate sector. From the number of recipients of the Government\u2019s poverty alleviation\nassistance in the form of Samurdhi, often used as a de facto poverty line, poverty incidence is\n                                                          \n1  The nine villages are Mapalana (Peak Wilderness), Seethagangula (Peak Wilderness), Pattipola (Horton Plains),\nMinihrigama (Minneriya), Palupitiya (Wasgamuwa), Hinukkiriyawa (Ritigala), Panahaduwa (Uda Walawe), and\nPallemalala (Bundala)  included in the seven pilot PA sites and Gallella (Flood Plains) outside the pilot sites.", "50\nAppendix 5, page 2\nmuch higher: 22-32 percent in eastern Uda Walawe, 48-100 percent in western Uda Walawe,\n75 percent in Wasgamuwa, 65 percent in Ritigala, 58-90 percent in southern Peak Wilderness,\n70 percent in Bundala, and 36-52 percent in  Minneriya.\n5. The PRA exercises showed, however, that community perceptions of poor/very poor\nhouseholds differ from those of official Samurdhi recipients, which are purely based on income\nlevels. Communities assessed poverty on a wider set of criteria including ownership of assets,\nlivelihoods, and family dynamics and report figures that differ significantly from Samurdhi-based\ndata.  The respective figures for community assessment and Samurdhi are 51 and 44 percent in\nMapalana (Peak Wilderness), 94 and 58 percent in Seethagangula (Peak Wilderness), 25 and\n87 percent in Pattipola (Horton Plains), 26 and 50 percent in Minihirigama (Minneriya), 97and 75\npercent in Palupitiya (Wasgamuwa), 65 and 10 percent in Hinukkiriyawa (Ritigala), and 55 and\n13 percent in Pallemalala (Bundala).2 These discrepancies indicate a major targeting implication\nfor the village-level microplanning during project implementation.\n6. Resource endowments and livelihood sources are site specific. Most villagers living near\nthe PAs engage in subsistence rain-fed agriculture often involving shifting cultivation (chena) in\nthe dry zone. Other income sources are inland fishing (Bundala, Uda Walawe, Minneriya), cattle\ngrazing  (Uda  Walawe,  Bundala,  Wasgamuwa,  Minneriya),  and  smallholder  tea  near  Peak\nWilderness.    Cash  incomes  from  horticultural  crops  are  mostly  limited  to  farmers  around\nWasgamuwa, while elsewhere, crops are generally grown for subsistence purposes only. At\nsome sites, distilling and selling of illicit liquor is the most lucrative source of income on which\n43 percent of villagers in Hinukkiriyawa (Ritigala) depend.\n7. The  land  tenure  situation  is  complex.    There  are  three  types  of  land  according  to\nownership: temple land, private land (Nindagam) inherited by descendents of the old rulers, and\nGovernment land.  Most of the population around the PAs fall under the categories of those\nunder private lease, permit holders allowed to use Government land, sharecroppers, and those\nwithout permits. Many do not possess any legal title or claim to land they use - which had been\nencroached upon - and as such are not eligible for formal bank lending for lack of collateral. The\nnumber of illegal encroachers on Government land, without titles, varied between 18 percent\n(Hiinukkiriyawa-Ritigala) and 78 percent (Minihirigama-Minneriya).  Small landholdings and land\nfragmentation were identified as contributing to encroachment by paddy farmers whose average\npaddy size is about 0.2 ha compared with the national average of 0.5 ha.\n8. Causes  of  poverty  identified  by  the  communities  through  the  PRAs  include  (i)\nlandlessness, lack of legal land titles, and poor-quality marginal lands leading to encroachment;\n(ii) fragmentation of land, reducing the viability of production; (iii) inadequate irrigation facilities;\n(iv) dependence on seasonal agricultural production and labor, resulting in insecure incomes;\n(v) dependence of low-income fishers working inside PA boundaries on licensed boat owners\nfor their livelihood; (vi) declining availability of forest products for collection; (vii) human-elephant\nconflict leading to loss of life and damage to crops and properties; (viii) lack of employment\nopportunities,  especially  among  the  educated  youth,  hence  dependence  on  casual  and\nseasonal labor,  out-migration, or the armed forces; (ix) dependence on moneylenders for credit\nneeds at high interest rates and being trapped by continued indebtedness; (x) poor access to\nmarket for agricultural produce and exploitation by middlemen; (xi) abuse of illicit liquor (PAs are\nused for hiding it) and consequent domestic violence and expenditure drain on family income;\n                                                          \n2\n  A full-scale PRA was not conducted in Panahaduwa (Uda Walawe).", "51\nAppendix 5, page 3\n(xii)  poor  access  to  drinking  water;  and  (xiii)  limited  access  to  social  and  communication\ninfrastructure.\n9. Poverty and deprivation are exacerbated by dependence on those who have access to\nassets, such as landowners, moneylenders, middlemen, traders, boat and fishing gear owners,\nand owners of large herds of cattle.  Such asset owners come not only from the better-off\ngroups  in  local  communities  but  also  from  cities  such  as  Hambantota  (Uda  Walawe),\nPolonnaruwa, Kandy (Flood Plains), Anuradhapura (Ritigala), and even Colombo.  Lack of\nemployment opportunities leads the poor into casual labor offered by these asset owners and\noutsiders. The poor of the community members are, therefore, vulnerable to being co-opted in\nsupport of livestock grazing, logging, poaching and gemstone mining within the PAs, often\nacting for low wages on behalf of organized gangs and business people from elsewhere.\n3.  Community Dependence on PAs\n10. About 90 percent of the communities near the PAs depend to varying degrees on the\nPAs\u2019 natural resources and spaces.  The activities engaged in include (i) poaching; (ii) timber\nfelling; (iii) fuelwood collection; (iv) fishing; (v) brewing of illicit liquor and using the PAs as hiding\nplaces; (vi) cattle grazing; (vii) collection of nontimber products (honey, medicinal herbs, fruits,\nand berries); and (viii) land encroachments.  They are common to all pilot PAs, although the\ndegree of occurrence may vary.\n11. Despite extensive use of PA resources and the acute resource depletion in many buffer\nzones, the earlier surveys under the social assessment found that the majority of households\nnear the PAs have diversified sources of income and do not entirely depend on the PAs for their\nmain source of livelihood.  This can be attributed to, first, overexploitation in some PAs, leading\nto declining dependence on PAs. Second, middle- and upper-income households with more\nassets control the use of resources.  This points to the importance of raising awareness among\nthe community members, especially the poor, on the necessity for resisting the pressure to be\nco-opted for illegal exploitation of  PA resources.  The empowerment of the poor to gain access\nto resources and manage these is a critical step in overcoming some of the strategic threats.\n4.  Gender\n12. The social assessment found no significant gender gaps in social indicators nor gender\ndiscrimination.  Within Muslim communities, the situation was less equal, with the women\u2019s orbit\nrestricted to household activities and home-based industries.  A clear gender division of labor\nwas observed elsewhere. Fuelwood, water collection, and extraction of nontimber products\n(berries,  fruits,  yams)  are  usually  associated  with  females  while  in  the  Muslim  community\n(Gallella-Flood Plains, though outside the scope of the Project), those are man\u2019s jobs.  Fishing\nis considered a male occupation.  Agriculture activities are shared. Activities requiring heavy\nphysical labor are reserved for men, while women and children engage in activities such as\nweeding,  transplanting,  harvesting,  and  winnowing  and  dehusking  of  grain,  which  require\ncontinuous application.\n13. Women at large bear the burden of poverty due to their multiple roles as economic\nproducers and family caretakers. Many of them seek casual employment or emigrate to other\ncountries or districts for employment.  Depletion of natural resources, especially fuelwood,\nsignificantly affects their workload.  In several villages, women observed that the amount of time\nneeded to collect one bundle of fuelwood has doubled over the last 10 years. Female-headed\nhouseholds are among the most disadvantaged groups, as they are sole income earners with", "52\nAppendix 5, page 4\nvery poor access to resources and information.  Further, liquor addiction, mainly of men, leads\nto family conflict and, in some cases, domestic violence where women suffer.  While women\u2019s\nrepresentation in the Samurdhi program implementation and the group savings schemes is\nhigh, their participation in community decision-making bodies is still limited.  Under the Project,\nNGOs/community based organizations (CBOs) will receive training to make sure that gender\nissues are addressed through the process of village microplanning.\nC.  Needs, Perceptions, and Capacity of Stakeholders\n1.  Community Perceptions of PAs and the PA Management\n14. Through  the  PRAs,  the  communities\u2019  knowledge  of  resource  use  and  availability,\nperceptions of problems regarding PAs and PA management, and potential solutions to them\nwere  elicited.  The  social  mapping  and  wealth  ranking  exercises  identified  the  spatial\nrelationships between the communities and the nearby PAs (e.g., how elephants enter the field,\nwhere  cattle  grazing  inside  the  PA  occurs)  and  the  geographical  location  of  the  poor\nhouseholds.    A  Venn  diagram  was  prepared  to  identify  the  local  stakeholders  and  their\nimportance to village life.  Through the preparation of problem trees, the communities also\nidentified the causes and effects of resource depletion and the potential solutions to them. After\nthe PRAs, many villagers, especially the youth, became aware of the importance of organizing\nthemselves to take strong actions against the temptation to engage in illegal wildlife exploitation\nin the PAs.\n15. Communities near the PAs are aware of the negative ecological impact of deforestation,\nencroachment on PA land, shifting cultivation, uncontrolled grazing, and erosion caused by\ncultivation along slopes.  They are also aware of the importance of PAs, conservation of wildlife\nand its sustainable use.  Further, they agreed that resource depletion is to a large extent driven\nby poverty (para. 8).  In addition to poverty and lack of alternative livelihood, the following were\nhighlighted as major issues leading to wildlife-related conflicts and problems: (i) lack of clear PA\nboundaries;  (ii)  inadequate  law  enforcement  in  PA  management  and  poorly  equipped  and\nmanned beat stations; (iii) political influence on law enforcement activities, creating a sense of\nsocial injustice; (iv) inadequate compensation schemes for crop damages caused by elephants;\nand (v) lack of communication between the communities and PA managers.  At some sites,\ntense relations are observed between the communities and PA managers as a result of a\nhistory of conflict, including the past wrong handling of villagers by the PA managers which has\nled to loss of human lives.\n16. The suggested solutions include (i) development of alternative livelihood sources (e.g.,\necotourism) for the economically marginalized groups and for the educated youth who see no\nfuture in traditional livelihood patterns; (ii) clear delineation of PA boundaries, based on the\nagreement between the villagers and the PA administrators; (iii) electrified fence to prevent\nelephant encroachments; (iv) creation of buffer zones or zoning of the PAs to allow space for\nhuman-wildlife  interaction  and  minimize  the  negative  impact  of  human-wildlife  conflicts;  (v)\nstronger and fairer enforcement of park rules, particularly against resource extractors from the\nbetter-off  inside  and  outside  the  communities;  (vi)  more  community  participation  in  PA\nmanagement; and (vii) raising public awareness on wildlife conservation.\n2.  Perceptions of Field Staff and Local Administrative Officers\n17. DWLC field staff (including the park officers and beat officers) generally shared the\ncommunities\u2019  perceptions  of  the  problems  and  solutions.    They  also  identified  inadequate", "53\nAppendix 5, page 5\ninfrastructure  and  equipment  and  lack  of  personnel  as  major  constraints  to  functioning\neffectively.  Some showed frustration with not being able to take action against illegal poachers\nand loggers from outside the communities due to political and other pressures.  There were also\nsome cases of self-reflection on the policing approach of the DWLC that ignores the needs of\nthe people. Some also expressed fear of dealing with local communities that show hostility\nagainst PA managers.\n18. The  perceptions  of  the  local  administrative  officers  including  those  from  Divisional\nSecretariat,  Grama  Niladharis,  and  Pradeshiya  Sabha  were  in  general  patronizing  and\nhighlighted a lack of awareness and knowledge of the communities near PAs and the traditional\nlivelihood problems.  The interesting similarity, however, was the helplessness and incapacity to\ndeal with illegal wildlife exploitation by organized groups and politicians.  Difficulties and hence\nneeds  in  coordination  among  relevant  departments/authorities  in  conservation  and  law\nenforcement were also identified.\n3.  Absorptive Capacity of Stakeholders\n19. Evidence from the Project\u2019s PRAs clearly shows that communities are fully capable of\ncommitting themselves to sustainable wildlife management both within and outside the PAs if\nthey are empowered and have strong leadership. But with the low community acceptance of\nGovernment officers and the limited capacity of the local administrative officers and the wildlife\nofficers, it is crucial to engage capable NGOs/CBOs in facilitating (i) social assessment and\ncommunity  mobilization;  (ii)  village-level  microplanning;  and  (iii)  coordination  between  the\ncommunities, the field unit of DWLC, and local public administrations.\n20. Village-level institutional assessment documented an inventory of existing NGOs/CBOs\nand their capacity.  The types of CBOs are location specific, but the Funeral Aid Society\nappears to be the best functioning one in all villages. In general, CBOs have limited functions\nand are not usually capable of comprehensive planning or stakeholder coordination.  A small\nnumber of domestic NGOs with strength in community mobilization for specific activities operate\nin  the  communities  near  the  project  PAs,  but  they  have  limited  capacity  in  facilitating\ncomprehensive  planning  and  coordination.  There  is  potential,  however,  that  locally  based\nNGOs/CBOs could be strengthened by capable and reputable international NGOs or institutes\nwith experience in PRAs, community planning, and stakeholder coordination.\n21. In the longer term, the field unit staff from DWLC should also have better communication\nand management skills in working directly with the communities and understanding their needs\nthrough training provided by the international/domestic NGOs/institutes, so that such skills are\nsustained at the local level of DWLC.\nD.  Project Strategy and Mechanism for Beneficiary Participation\n1.  Project Strategy\n22. The findings of the social assessment have been translated into the following project\nsocial strategy:\n(i)  facilitate community access to technical know-how, new knowledge, skills training, credit\nfacilities, and alternative means of livelihood that will build its absorptive capacity to\nparticipate effectively in PA management;", "54\nAppendix 5, page 6\n(ii)  improve community-PA managers (i.e., DWLC staff) relationships, which would result in\ncommitment to a common objective of PA management and wildlife conservation;\n(iii)  facilitate, through the services of capable NGOs/CBOs, the creation of an enabling\nenvironment  for  the  community  members,  both  men  and  women,  to  engage  in\ninformation generation, problem analysis, and microplanning for which the community\ntakes ownership in implementing, monitoring, and evaluation;\n(iv)  allow the community and PA managers to jointly develop sustainable livelihood and\nwildlife management using an adaptive learning process on a case-by-case basis;\n(v)  sustain the capacity of the community to access productive resources and contribute to\nPA management and wildlife conservation beyond the project time frame.\n23. The above social strategy has been incorporated into the design of component D of the\nProject,  in  which  community  participation  is  promoted  under  the  sustainable  financing\nmechanism of the Protected Area Conservation Trust (PACT) (Appendix 6).  The following\nprocess for community empowerment will take place:\n(i)  social mobilization within a forum that represents the target community;\n(ii)  problem  analysis  where  community  members,  through  a  range  of  participatory\ntechniques, identify and prioritize the problems and opportunities that members of each\ncommunity face;\n(iii)  community-based resource assessments that identify and describe the demand for and\nsupply of resources, the holders of ownership or use rights, season of use, and the\ncommunity users of these resources;  the  assessment will also evaluate necessary\nchanges;\n(iv)  formulating  community  microplans,  where  all  community  members  agree  on  the\ndevelopment objectives and construct strategies with technical inputs from a range of\ngovernment sectors including irrigation, agricultural services, livestock, forestry, wildlife,\neducation, tourism, and health;\n(v)  developing community (or subcommunity) resource agreements with the DWLC based\non the community microplans, including the delineation of PA boundaries;\n(vi)  implementing microplans using local resources, local government resources, NGO input,\nGovernment programs, seed grants from the PACT, community outreach grants, and\ntechnical assistance from component B of the Project, as necessary;\n(vii)  developing areawide planning processes in which plans from contiguous communities\nare integrated;\n(viii)  establishing a joint decision-making mechanism for involving community representatives\nfrom the areawide planning process that would include local DWLC staff and other\nrelevant agencies; and\n(ix)  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  implementation  and  impact  of  microplans  by  the\ncommunities, local DWLC staff, and relevant local authorities, using key performance", "55\nAppendix 5, page 7\nindicators  (KPIs)  on  which  the  performance  of  the  contracted  NGOs/CBOs  will  be\nassessed.  The KPIs are (a) the level of poverty impact and the participation of the poor,\n(b) increased community knowledge of environmental issues, and (c) the level of conflict\nresolution achieved.\n2.  Risks and Safeguards\n24. Major social risks include the following.  First, political interference in the movement\nagainst illegal wildlife exploitation and the PACT is expected.  Minimizing this risk is difficult;\nhowever, community empowerment and DWLC field staff capacity building will foster vigilance\nagainst such interference, while the PACT will have transparent and accountable structures and\nprocedures  that  sit  outside  of  Government.    Second,  there  is    concern  about  the  overall\nNGO/CBO capacity on which the long-term success of community empowerment depends.\nExtensive training will be conducted by far more capable NGOs under the Project to minimize\nthe risks.  To ensure that women\u2019s needs (e.g., measures against domestic violence, better\naccess to drinking water) and participation are incorporated into the microplanning, gender\ntraining will be included as part of capacity building.\n25. The overall principle of the Project is to avoid relocation of households. Therefore, it\ndoes not envisage significant resettlement or land acquisition.  The Project will make every\neffort to avoid social relocation through boundary alignment and, if necessary, zoning inside the\nPA to allow inhabitation.  Decisions on the boundaries will be made in a fully participatory\nmanner involving all key stakeholders. If relocation is unavoidable, a resettlement plan will be\nprepared for each PA after a detailed census, social assessment, and PRA, according to ADB\u2019s\nHandbook on Resettlement and will be agreed upon by ADB and the Government before\nboundaries are set and any other actions are taken.", "56\nAppendix 6, page 1\nPROTECTED AREA CONSERVATION TRUST\nA.  Introduction\n1. Conservation of Sri Lanka\u2019s protected areas (PAs) will only succeed if support of the\ncommunities in the vicinity of the PAs can be mobilized for maintaining the integrity of the PA\nboundaries and the resources the PAs contain. Without such support, the outcome of protection\nefforts and management inputs into PAs are more than offset by the continued impact of\nexpanding  human  activity.  Several  approaches  have  been  initiated,  starting  from  public\nawareness and extension activities to direct income support. Most of these attempts have had\nonly mixed success and limited impact. From international experience and as a result of the\nconsultation,1 the consensus was that there is need for a process that allows buffer zone\ncommunities to become an integral part of PA conservation through a program of empowerment\nthat leads toward a set of agreed-upon goals, rights, and responsibilities in relation to PAs. The\nconsultations  confirmed  that  this  process  would  require  a  wider  landscape  planning  and\nmanagement  approach  supported  by  investments  and  benefit-sharing  arrangements  that\ndirectly address the root causes and threats to the PA system. It was universally felt that such\nempowerment requires a financing vehicle and support mechanism that can sustain it over the\nlong term. The proposed Protected Area Conservation Trust (PACT) is designed to be such a\nvehicle.  The  PACT\u2019s  design,  size,  and  operating  mechanisms  are  based  on  an  extensive\nconsultation  process,  and  are  consistent  with  best  practices  and  experiences  learned\ninternationally with conservation trust funds. Detailed financial analysis, based on a needs\nassessment, indicates that the PACT is ex ante financially sustainable. Furthermore, (i) the\nGovernment has expressed its support for a public-private sector mechanism outside direct\ngovernment control to support a buffer zone community empowerment process; (ii) the country\u2019s\nbasic fabric of legal and financial practices including supporting institutions such as banking,\nauditing, and contracting are sufficiently developed to provide the services needed for the PACT\nto operate effectively; and (iii) there is a critical mass of stakeholders from diverse sectors of\nsociety that can work in partnership to conserve biodiversity sustainably.\nB.  Deed\n2. The deed of the PACT will be prepared under a Sri Lankan ordinance for establishing a\ncharitable trust. The liability of the trustees will be limited. It is axiomatic that the trust does not\npay tax on its income or on any of its investments.  The deed will describe the principles under\nwhich the trust will operate and its bylaws. The trustees will ensure that they seek the best\npossible return on their endowment and any gifts through a professional asset manager.\nC.  Objectives\n3. The objectives of the PACT are as follows:\n(i)  Facilitate  professional  management  of  a  capital  endowment  to  finance\ncommunity and participatory benefits from conservation and protected areas in\nSri Lanka.  The settlor will assign the capital endowment or investment structure,\nand the trust will adopt an appropriate investment portfolio consonant with the\nobjectives of the trust.  An experienced trust manager of excellent track record\n                                                \n1  An extensive stakeholder consultation process that lasted over 2.5 years involved over 30 workshops at the\nlocal, provincial, and national levels. The consultation was complemented by detailed social assessments in\neach of the pilot PAs using rapid rural appraisal techniques.", "57\nAppendix 6, page 2\nwill professionally manage the trust portfolio. The trust manager will be appointed\nby board of trustees in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n(ii)  Finance any appropriate entity that will best meet the objectives of the trust to\nundertake any of the following: (a) social mobilization, (b) community resource\nassessments, (c) community natural resource management, (d) community/micro\nlevel  planning,  (e)  areawide  planning  frameworks,  (f)  community-based\nconservation agreements, and (g) capital investments to deliver the objectives of\nthe trust.\n(iii)  Provide investment capital for implementation of community initiatives with direct\nlinks  to  conservation  benefits  (e.g.  community  woodlots  establishment,\ncommunity  fodder  production,  etc.),  the  capital  to  be  provided  as  grants  to\ncommunities  (or  their  stated  contractor),  with  in-kind  contributions  from  the\nbeneficiaries.\n(iv)  Strengthen  the  capacity  of  community  groups  and  associations.  Once\nstrengthened, these groups will be able to prove their implementation capability\nand thereby compete successfully for proceeds of the PACT.\n(v)  Manage annual trust revenues according to the following: (a) adopting a growth\nstrategy for the endowment through reinvestment of 25 percent of the annual\nrevenue;  (b)  using  a  maximum  of  20  percent  of  annual  revenues  for\nadministrative costs; (c) applying the remaining funds to the objectives of the\ntrust, using a competitive grant-making process on an annual basis.\nD.  Endowment and Trust Management\n4.       A total initial endowment of $8 million is targeted.  This would provide approximately\n$0.5\u20130.6 million per annum to invest in local community initiatives.  It is expected that the\nendowment will be funded with a GEF grant of $4 million and another $4 million from bilateral\ngrant sources.  The endowment will not receive any Government funds and will be operated\nindependently from the Government. Trust programs will be developed to raise funds from other\nbilateral sources and the corporate sector.  This will be the responsibility of the chief executive\nand  the  trustees.  The  endowment  will  be  entrusted  to  a  commercial  trust  manager  for\ninvestment with a conservative risk profile determined by the board of trustees, and which is\nenvironmentally benign. The endowment fund will be invested offshore to capture the benefits of\nglobal markets and to protect against any possible devaluation of the domestic currency.\nE.  Trustees\n5. The trustees will be limited to nine: six eminent people acceptable to ADB and three ex\nofficio  representatives,  one  each  from  the  Department  of  Wildlife  Conservation,  Forest\nDepartment,  and  Coast  Conservation  Department.  A  search  committee  comprising  a  wide\nrepresentation  of  stakeholders  will  identify  the  trustees  in  a  transparent  and  participatory\nprocess.  No decision of the board of trustees can be executed unless the board meeting has a\nquorum of six.  Every three years, one trustee will step down and a new trustee will be\nappointed.  The board of trustees, excluding ex officio trustees, will decide the appointment of\nall new trustees.  A trustee is limited to serve no more than nine years.  The board chairman will\nbe elected by the board of trustees.  The chairmanship will be open for election every year and\nthe sitting chairperson can be reelected.", "58\nAppendix 6, page 3\nF.  Executive and Operational Procedures\n6.        The  trust  will  establish  an  appropriately  staffed  secretariat  under  the  trustees  for\nmanagement including the appointment of a chief executive officer. Trust establishment and the\noperational expenses of the PACT for the first two years will be borne by the Project. The\nsecretariat, under the guidance of the board and with assistance provided by an international\nnongovernment organization with experience in conservation trust funds as well as domestic\nand  international  consulting  services,  will  be  charged  with  the  preparation  of  a  detailed\noperations/procedures manual, and monitoring mechanisms in addition to the principles set out\nin the trust\u2019s bylaws and deed. The funding priority of the trust is to support projects that\nreinforce the linkage between PA management and biodiversity conservation and the project\nconcerned.  The project pilot PAs will receive priority during the project implementation phase.\nThe application procedures will be published on an annual basis in the form of guidelines as a\npublic document, and the trustees will determine these.  Project eligibility will be founded on the\nprinciple that the direct or indirect effect or objectives will enhance the connection between\nbiodiversity conservation and community benefit. Project eligibility is dependent on sustainability\nat the end of the project period. The trustees will be expected to apply at least 50 percent of\nannual  revenues  to  sustainable  projects  for  the  support  of  communities  in  biodiversity\nconservation.  The board of trustees is expected to meet monthly during the first two years of\nPACT establishment and thereafter as required. The board will review all proposals prepared by\nthe applicants and management officers, and decide on project acceptability and the level of\nfunding offered (or any other conditionalities applied).\nG.  Reporting and Auditing\n7. The  trust  has  a  number  of  reporting  responsibilities.  The  board  of  trustees  will  be\nresponsible for publishing annual and audited accounts for publication.  The board will appoint\ntrust accountants and auditors from a reputable accounting firm.", "59\nAppendix 7, page 1\nTable A7.1: Summary of Costs\n($\u2019000)\nSustainable\nEnhancing Participatory Financing\nInstitutional Adaptive for\nCapacity for Management Collaborative Community\nProtected Area of Protected Conservation Partnership\nItem Management Areas Planning Building Total\nInvestment Costs\nA.

Wildlife Insurance Feasibility Specialist.  The specialist will (i) evaluate the potential\nfor  establishing  a  wildlife  insurance  scheme,  (ii)  prepare  a  detailed  business  plan  and\ninvestment manifesto for such a scheme directed to the private sector, (iii) run a workshop on\nthe findings for private sector and DWLC personnel, and (iv) provide other training inputs as\nrequired.\n21. Participatory Rural Appraisal Action Research Team. These specialists (2) will (i)\nliaise with the social NGO partner described in para. 27, particularly in the design and delivery\nof field programs; and (ii) provide ongoing field support for PA outreach units as part of in-job\ntraining for departmental staff.\n3.  Terms of Reference for NGO Partnership\n22. The Project will contract for a six-year period a consortium of NGOs from a preselected\nlist to provide strategic direction, technical support, research advice, and ongoing capacity\nbuilding and field support within the wildlife and social domains of the Project.  The same\nconsortium will also develop and provide project impact assessments.\n23. The wildlife partner, an international NGO, will have skills in scientific research oriented\nto wildlife conservation and management, monitoring, field training, and translocation and have\nextensive field experience in these areas in Asia. Specifically, the NGO will (i) review ecological\ninventory,  research,  and  monitoring  procedures  of  DWLC;  (ii)  develop,  document,  and\nimplement improved procedures; (iii) help develop the wildlife and habitat research agenda with\nDWLC; and (iv) assist in setting  research priorities and the specification of terms of reference\nand monitoring of research studies.\n24. The social NGO partner will be an international or domestic NGO that has skills in\ncommunity development, gender and development, outreach, social analysis, and monitoring.\nThe NGO will (i) provide field support and technical training to the outreach units of DWLC (both\ncentralized and local); (ii) provide field support and technical training to the NGO contractors of\nthe PACT; (iii) provide detailed specifications of key performance indicators related to structural\npoverty analysis, community empowerment, environmental education, conflict management and\nresolution, partnership building and community action plan preparation; (iv) assist in the design\nof programs to monitor these indicators; and (v) provide training inputs as required.\n25. To meet the needs of global accountability, best-practice replicability, and international\nlearning, and as an input to adaptive management, the impacts of the Project will be assessed.\nBaseline studies and key performance indicators will be established in year 1, processes and\nperformance reviewed early in year 3 to inform the midterm review, and again in year 6 to\ninform the final evaluation.  The impact monitoring team will (i) define indicators and assess the\nstatus and trends applicable to major resources of the pilot PAs, (ii) assess the suitability and\nsustainability  of  PA  management  and  community  strengthening  and  partnership-building\narrangements,  and  (iii)  evaluate  the  degree  of  stakeholder  participation  in  resource\nmanagement decisions.  The team will have the right to inspect any aspect of the Project, and\nwill produce a publicly available report within two months of the end of each assessment.", "67\nAppendix 10, page 5\nC.  Trust Fund Technical Support\n26. The PACT will be partnered with an appropriate technical agency with similar objectives\nand experience in managing conservation trust funds. The partner will assist the board of\ntrustees and the chief executive officer of the PACT in  (i) legal issues, financial management,\ninformation  management,  tracking  systems  during  start-up;  (ii)  liaison  with  major  funding\nagencies and providing assistance in securing additional financial contributions; (iii) supporting\nthe establishment and building the capacity of the executive; (iv) identifying and resolving\nproblems; and (v) providing other appropriate forms of support to both the board of directors and\nthe executive in carrying out their responsibilities.\nD.  Research Studies\n27. Effective management requires good information. In many cases, data does not exist for\nmanagement problems confronting DWLC. Good research skills exist in several universities and\nallowance has been made to provide for seven research grants to address key research topics\nannually. The DWLC Research Advisory Committee in association with the wildlife NGO will\nprioritize and coordinate this research agenda. The research will be undertaken mainly by\ngraduate-level students, thereby adding to future domestic capacity building.\nE.  Study Tours and Exchanges\n28. A wealth of global experience relating to many of the challenges currently faced by\nDWLC exists and provides excellent opportunities for learning. Costa Rica, for example, has\nhad over 20 years of growth with ecotourism developments and offers a wide range of private\nand public models for examination. Similarly, the PA system in South Africa has a lot of\nexperience  in  wildlife  habitat  management,  control  of  alien  species,  and  environmental\ninventories. New Zealand pioneered the development of electric fences and has continued to be\nan innovator in this field. Allowance has been made for visits to such locations for small\nnumbers of DWLC staff and, in some cases, other personnel annually.\nF.  Information Technology Contracts\n29. A local company will be contracted to provide the technical inputs to the design and\ndevelopment of the DWLC information technology requirements.  This will include web page\ndevelopment, local area networks for Giritale and the head office, systems installation, training\nin the use of the operational systems, design and development of MIS modules and reporting\nsystems from these, and software assessment and purchase.\nG.  Capacity Building\n30. Human resource development - from administrative and managerial through to technical\nand field-based skills - is central to updating sector capacities. A range of activities has been\nproposed, including workshops, courses, study tours, local and international short courses, and\ngraduate fellowships at national, regional, and international institutions. Within DWLC, training\nat  headquarters  will  be  directed  at  the  technical  units  and  the  outreach  section,  and  at\nupgrading  financial  and  accounting  offices,  and  raising  general  managerial  and  computer\nliteracy skills. Substantial training inputs will also be devoted to training at the regional and site\nlevels of operation. Overall, DWLC accounts for 51 percent of the training beneficiaries. The\nremainder will include other conservation agencies and/or the private sector, communities, and\nNGOs.", "68\nAppendix 10, page 6\nTable A10.2: Summary of Capacity Building\nItem Unit 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Total\n1.

The Project will generate significant local, national, and global returns, many of which\nare indirect or nonuse benefits that in all likelihood exceed the direct benefits.  Methods to\nquantify and value such benefits do exist and could be adopted to illustrate the full impact of the\nProject. In the context of this analysis, however, where the objective is to assess the rationale\nfor  investment  in  interventions  ranging  from  institutional  strengthening  to  community\nempowerment, quantification and valuation of indirect or nonuse benefits are less meaningful.\nFurthermore,  given  the  resource  constraints  of  project  preparation,  the  verification  and\nmodification  of  existing  information  to  be  adapted  to  the  project  sites  were  considered\nimpractical.  Hence, the following economic and financial analyses are partial and relate only to\nspecific activities of the Project.  A qualitative description of the indirect and nonuse benefits is\nincluded to illustrate their significance.  Typically, global impacts generated by the Project would\nnot be included; however, they are mentioned here to highlight their significance, and hence the\njustification for cofinancing by the Global Environment Facility.\n2. The financial and economic analyses are limited to the Project activities that relate\nspecifically to direct revenue-generating outcomes.  From a national perspective, the activities\nrelated  to  ecotourism  development  are  the  primary  focus  of  the  analysis.    From  a  local\nperspective of support zone communities, the focus is on typical income-generating activities\nthat could be undertaken with the assistance of the Protected Area Conservation Trust (PACT)\nor other sources of funding.  The viability of several such activities is discussed to indicate the\nlikelihood of participation by beneficiaries.\nA.  Financial and Sustainability Analyses\n1. Fiscal Impact\n3. A financial analysis was undertaken to ascertain the impact of the project interventions\non the Government\u2019s fiscal position and to assess their financial sustainability.  The analysis\nincludes with- and without-Project scenarios, with the incremental effects being attributed to the\nProject.  The interventions related to ecotourism development are mainly in components A and\nB.  The cost of the interventions accounts for about 10 percent of the total investment cost, or\nabout $3.1 million.\n4. The  revenue  stream  is  derived  mainly  from  entrance  fees  and  service  charges  at\nprotected areas (PAs).  In addition, the Government will generate revenue from taxes on\nincremental goods and services (GST) developed by the support zone communities as a result\nof project interventions.  The stream of revenue is estimated on the basis of several key\nassumptions:\n(i)  Foreign  visitor  arrivals  to  the  country  are  projected  under  three  scenarios:  high-,\nmedium- and low-growth. From historical trends (1995-1999), it is assumed that 11\npercent of foreign tourists will visit PAs. With the Project, it is assumed that visitors to the\nPAs will increase by 1 percent in year 6, increasing up to 5 percent by year 10 and\nthereafter.  Accordingly, the number of foreign visitors to PAs by year 2010 will be about\n110,000, or about 15 percent of total visitors.  The Project is likely to have a bearing on\nthe overall foreign visitor arrivals in Sri Lanka as well (as the country earns a reputation\nfor ecotourism); however, this is not taken into account in the analysis.", "72\nAppendix 12, page 2\n(ii)  National visitors to PAs are expected to increase according to historic trends (1995-\n1999). With the Project, the rate of increase is assumed to be higher.  Three scenarios\nof growth (high, medium, and low) are considered.  Accordingly, in year 2010, about\n604,000 nationals will visit PAs.\n(iii)  Expenditure on park entrance and services applicable to foreign tourists will increase by\n10 percent with effect from year 6 of the Project.  The corresponding increase applicable\nto national tourists will be 15 percent.  These are incremental effects, not counting the\naverage increase in expenditure by both categories on the basis of historical trends.\n(iv)  Incremental  revenue  from  GST  is  calculated  on  the  assumption  that  average  daily\nexpenditure by foreign tourists (other than expenditure on park entrance and services)\nwill  increase  by  5  percent  beginning  in  year  6  of  the  Project.    Correspondingly,\nexpenditure  by  national  visitors  will  increase  by  15  percent.    Expenditure  by  both\ncategories will increase, according to historic trends, in the without-Project case as well.\n5. Based on the assumptions, the analysis suggests that direct revenue to the Government\nfrom the Project will be in the range of $400,000 to $1.1 million by year 2010.  By year 2020, the\nrevenue is expected to be $1-$2.3 million. From the point of view of the Government\u2019s fiscal\nbalance, therefore, revenues will more than cover the Project\u2019s operating and maintenance\ncosts, which are estimated to be approximately $233,000 per year.\n2. Financial Sustainability\n6. The Project extends the range of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC) field\nactivities, which will require additional resources if they are to be sustained.  Primary among\nthese are the community outreach and adaptive management programs.  Whereas community\npartnerships are financed through the PACT, which, due to the nature of endowment trusts,\nrepresents a self-sustaining input, the DWLC community outreach program is reliant on project\nfunding.  To address this, the Government has agreed to introduce a revenue-sharing policy\ninvolving the transfer of a minimum of 50 percent of PA revenues to DWLC for capital works and\noperating costs.  This program is forecast to add more than SLRs100 million per annum to the\nDWLC budget within a 6 year timeframe, which is earmarked for the DWLC capital budget\ncurrently costing SLRs40-50 million per annum and for the community outreach and adaptive\nmanagement operating programs. Therefore, resources will be available on an ongoing basis\nfor maintaining these programs beyond the life of the Project\n7. Financial analyses were conducted of typical income-generating projects that are likely\nto be financed either through seed grants from the PACT or by communities accessing other\ngovernment and nongovernment sources of funding. Typical projects include (i) woodlots owned\nor managed by local community members, (ii) fenced grazing of cattle, (iii) operating a rice\nstorehouse, and (iv) production of buffalo curd or honey. The models proved financially viable,\nconfirming the positive beneficiary participation in the activities to be undertaken by the PACT.\nHowever, the results are not extrapolated into a broader analysis of the Project due to the\nprocess  orientation  of  the  interventions  -  resulting  in  a  potentially  wide-ranging  set  of\ninvestments - and dispersed set of beneficiaries with benefits diffused over time and space.\nB.  Economic Analysis\n8. The economic analysis covers only the ecotourism-related activities of the Project and is\na  direct  extension  of  the  financial  analysis  described  above.  It  represents  a  conventional", "73\nAppendix 12, page 3\neconomic analysis, which does not include the significant positive environmental and social\neffects that will be generated by the Project.  Many of these externalities cannot be meaningfully\nincluded in quantitative terms in the economic analysis and are therefore illustrated in qualitative\nterms in the following section.\n9. Economic border prices (world price) are used in the economic analysis.   Costs are\nbroken  into  traded,  nontraded,  labor  and  tax  factors  and  converted  to  world  prices.  For\nnontradables, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 was applied to derive economic prices\nconsistent with recent SCFs applied in Asian Development Bank and World Bank projects.  A\nshadow wage rate factor of 0.81 and the SCF were used to adjust the labor component to\neconomic prices.  The costs of local materials (nontradables) were based on prevailing market\nprices, which were assumed to remain unchanged in real terms (in constant 2000 prices).\n10. Tourism  revenues  are  first  adjusted  down  to  represent  foreign  exchange  leakages\n(considered to be approximately 35 percent) and then adjusted up (by a factor of 1.35) to reflect\nthe economic effects of forward linkages from tourism within the national economy.  Revenue\nfrom national tourism is stated in terms of willingness to pay for wildlife recreational facilities.1\nProject interventions will be ongoing over six years beginning in year 2001, and the effects will\nbe realized over a period of 20 years.\nC.  Economic Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis\n11. Using the assumptions on costs and benefits, the base case economic internal rate of\nreturn was calculated.  The sensitivity analysis includes three variations to the base case:  (i) a\nreduction in benefit stream by 10 percent, which is indicative of lower mean annual incremental\ntourism revenue; (ii) a 10 percent increase in costs reflecting increased costs due to site factors\nand cost overruns; and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).  The cash flows and the rates of return\nfor the medium-growth scenarios are shown in Table A12.\nD.  Nonquantifiable and Indirect Benefits\n12. While the focus of the economic analysis is on the direct and quantifiable benefits\nresulting  from  ecotourism  and  related  services,  the  Project  has  other  significant  economic\nbenefits that are either indirect or nonquantifiable.\n13. Above all, the protection provided to Sri Lanka\u2019s rich and largely endemic biodiversity\nprovides benefits to local, national, and global levels of society.  At the local level, communities\nwill benefit from employment and improvement in living standards generated by the demand for\necotourism-related services.  Benefits at the national level include the ability to cater to the\necotourism niche market and generate significant forward linkages within the national economy;\nability to attract external assistance and foreign direct investment in ecotourism and biodiversity-\nrelated areas; ability to comply with international commitments on protection of biodiversity; the\noption  value  of  preserving  biological  resources  for  future  exploitation,  particularly  for  bio-\nprospecting  and  research;  and  the  opportunity  to  demonstrate  effective  and  decentralized\ngovernance through a strengthened and better trained DWLC.  Global society will benefit from\n(i) the enhanced carbon sequestration potential of the PAs; (ii) protection of endemic species;\n(iii)  maintenance  of  habitat  used  by  internationally  mobile  species,  especially  turtles  and\nwaterfowl; and (iv) less tangibly, from the existence value of better managed PAs in Sri Lanka.\n                                                    \n1  Silva, K.A.D.I. and H. B. Kotagama. 1997. An Optimal Fee for Entrance to Uda Walawe National Park: An\nAssessment. Tropical Agric. Res. 9:317-329.", "74\nAppendix 12, page 4\n14. The community partnerships developed under component D will generate substantial\neconomic benefits to civil society, particularly in the support zones of the PAs:  192 communities\nrepresenting 180,000 people, 50 percent of whom are recipients of Samurdhi welfare payments.\nThe  project  interventions  will  benefit  them  in  several  ways,  enabling  them  to  undertake\ncollective planning and decision making, and to exercise empowerment by obtaining financing\nfor community development initiatives and new employment opportunities through the income-\ngenerating activities.  The overall impact will be an improvement in the standard of living of\nthese people, and mutually reinforcing and sustainable interactions with the PAs and buffer\nzones adjacent to their communities.\n15. Several project interventions will serve to reduce the prevailing human-elephant conflict.\nReaching an exact figure on the cost of this conflict avoided by the Project is difficult.  However,\nan approximate figure can be calculated from the fact that from 1996 to 1999, DWLC paid out\nan average of SLRs2.5 million per year in compensation fund.  Assuming that the amount\ncovers only 5 percent of the true cost of the human-elephant conflict, given the low payment\nlevels and low claims, the cost can be estimated at about SLRs50 million per year. The Project\nis expected to reduce damages related to human-elephant conflict by 75 percent, leading to an\nannual estimated benefit of SLRs37.5 million or about $0.5 million.  This figure is conservative,\nsince it does not include the costs to farmers of constant night guarding and purchasing torch\nbatteries and thunder flashes during the crop season.  Nor does this figure include the impact\non the quality of life from constant stress, anxiety, and fear.  In the most affected villages,\nhuman-elephant conflict is listed as the most pressing problem facing the community.\n16. PAs cover a substantial portion of the upper catchments of several major rivers and\nreservoirs, particularly Peak Wilderness Sanctuary and Horton Plains National Park since four\nmajor rivers (Mahaweli, Kelani, Walawe and Kalu) originate in these wet-zone highlands.  It is\nestimated that encroachment on the PAs is currently at a rate of over 1 percent per year; this is\nassumed to reduce to zero with the project interventions.  Encroachment typically implies a\nconversion of land from its current state of degraded forest and scrub to degraded grassland, a\ntransformation that is estimated to increase soil losses by 5 tons per hectare per year.2 Apart\nfrom the cost of replacing topsoil, erosion has a significant bearing on the hydropower potential\nof downstream reservoirs, which provide over 80 percent of the nation\u2019s total electricity supply.\nThe cost of one cubic meter of siltation in terms of lost hydropower potential has been estimated\nat  $180.3    Accordingly,  the  cost  of  siltation  avoided  through  project  interventions  in  Peak\nWilderness and Horton Plains is estimated at SLRs6.2 million per year.4\n17. Finally, least tangible are the in situ ecosystem benefits such as the value of protecting\nspecies  for  future  generations  and  the  value  of  habitat  for  migratory  species.  One  study\nestimated that the total economic value of biodiversity conservation achieved by Sri Lanka is\nabout SLRs660 per ha/yr (1994 prices). 5   Similarly, the value of biodiversity conservation from\nan international perspective has been estimated in many studies.6 No attempt is made to assign\nan economic value to the incremental benefits of biodiversity conservation that will arise from\nthis Project; however, it is noted as significant.\n                                                    \n2  Forestry Sector Master Plan, July 1995.\n3  Loan 1545-SRI: Upper Watershed Management Project , for 16.6 million, approved on 24 September 1997.\n4   Horton Plains and Peak Wilderness cover a total area of 25,500 hectares, and 2.7 tons of silt is required to fill 1\nm3.\n5  Ekanayake, E.R.M. and P.
