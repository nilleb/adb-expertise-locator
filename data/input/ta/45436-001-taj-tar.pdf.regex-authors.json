INTRODUCTION \n1.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  the  result  of  2  years  of  consultation1 led  by  the \nGovernment of Tajikistan, Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development, and World Bank in the context of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience \n(PPCR).2 The  outcome  of  the  consultation  was  Tajikistan\u2019s  Strategic  Program  for  Climate \nResilience (SPCR), including four investment projects and the two capacity building activities \ndescribed in the proposed TA. The SPCR aligns with national priorities indicated in the country \npartnership strategy.3 The proposed TA is included in the country operations business plan.4 \nThe nature and scope of the TA were discussed with stakeholders and development partners \nduring  three  consultation  missions  fielded  from  August  to  October  2011.  The  government \nconcurred  with  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost,  implementation  and  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. The TA design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Tajikistan is one of the Central Asian countries most vulnerable to climate change.6 In \nrecognition of its high vulnerability, Tajikistan was chosen as one of the nine countries to \nparticipate in the PPCR. The expert group7 established under the PPCR to select developing \ncountries around the world ranked Tajikistan very high for its vulnerability to climate-induced \ndisasters based on indicators  of expected mortality and economic losses. The capacity of \ninstitutions, communities, and individuals to adapt to climate change was rated very low, based \non the Human Development Index8 and other indicators related to water and food security. A \nrecent study carried out by ADB and the Government of Tajikistan in the context of the PPCR 9 \nshows that since the 1980s higher temperatures, decreased snowfall, droughts, avalanches, \nlandslides, rock falls, and violent winds have routinely destroyed crops and infrastructure and, in \nthe worst cases, taken lives. The projected rise in average temperature of up to 2oC by 2050 will \ncause glacial melt and early snow melt, changing the seasonality of runoff and affecting the \nstability of water supplies for agriculture, hydropower, and human consumption. More frequent \ndrought, catastrophic flooding due to glacier lake outbursts, the destabilization of mountain \nslopes, and more frequent landslides will progressively incur economic losses, pose risks to the \npopulation, and hamper the ability of communities to rise out of poverty. These adverse effects \nwill be compounded by projected 67% population growth10 during the 21st century and will \nexacerbate  underlying  socioeconomic  and  environmental  constraints:  land  degradation, \ncrumbling infrastructure, the increasing feminization of poverty, unsustainable debt, and limited \ninstitutional capacity. \n \n                                                \n1 The  consultations  engaged  over  200  stakeholders  from  government  ministries  and  agencies,  international \norganizations, development partners, civil society, and communities in the Pyanj and the Vashkh river basins. \n2  In 2009, ADB established the ADB Strategic Climate Fund to enable it to administer funds from the SCF.

Recent assessments and consultations carried out under the PPCR show that gaps in \nthe understanding of climate risks, combined with the limited adaptive capacity of individuals \nand institutions, prevent Tajikistan from effectively anticipating and managing climate change.11 \nTwo main constraints were identified. First, data and information on current climate variability; \nfuture climate change; and its impacts on communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems are \ninadequate  to  inform  decision  making.  Inadequate  equipment  for  data  collection,  limited \nresources for acquiring and maintaining equipment, the inadequacy of technical staff capacity, \nand salaries too low to retain trained staff hinder the ability of responsible agencies to generate, \nstore, and analyze climate data to produce information for decision makers. While current \ninitiatives address the need to improve the infrastructure for data collection, the use of data for \nweather forecasting and climate modeling is extremely limited.12 Access to climate information is \ninadequate to support measures to reduce the adverse effects of climate change on priority \nsectors such as water resource management, energy, rural development, transport, and health. \nWomen\u2019s access to climate information is poor, and information is often provided in ways \ninappropriate for them. Education and training on how to use the available data are insufficient \nto provide a sustained skill pool for weather forecasting and modeling. \n \n4.  Second, climate change risks are not integrated into development plans. Development \nprojects in key sectors do not consider climate change risks, and nothing is being done to \nfacilitate  such  transformational  change  in  development  planning.  Most  public  officials  are \nunfamiliar  with  climate  proofing,  risk  screening  tools,  and  economic  analysis  of  climate \nadaptation options, which are required to prioritize and budget adaptation measures. Public \nawareness of climate change is increasing but remains low in local government agencies, \nparticularly among women.13 The government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) alike \nlack  adequate  skills  pools  to  support  the  implementation  of  such  structural  measures  as \nphysical construction to reduce the possible impacts of hazards such as drought and flooding, \nor of nonstructural measures such as instituting building codes, laws on land-use planning, and \npublic awareness programs. As a result, development projects cannot be formulated to consider \ndesign and engineering features that respond to climate change risks. Overlapping mandates \namong agencies, inadequate coordination, meager fund flows, and weak resource allocation \nmechanisms are major impediments to the effective management of climate change risks. No \nclear strategies or plans with targets and sources of funding exist to deal with climate change \nrisks. The monitoring and evaluation of current climate change policies and projects are absent. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n5.  This TA will enhance planning capacity for climate change adaptation nationally and \nlocally in vulnerable sectors and populations. In line with ADB\u2019s commitment under the PPCR, \nADB will administer the SPCR components on climate modeling and science and on building \ncapacity for climate resilience.14 The climate science and modeling component will (i) enhance \ncapacity to develop climate change models and interpret the outputs from those models to \ninform decision making, (ii) develop a management information system for climate data, (iii) train \nlocal experts, and (iv) introduce climate science and glaciology modules in institutions of higher \neducation. The component for building capacity for climate resilience will (i) strengthen climate \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2012.

Tajikistan:  Key  Priorities  for  Climate  Adaptation. \nhttps://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/3969 \n14 The PPCR subcommittee approved the SPCR in principle for funding in November 2010.  \n ", "  3 \nrisk management practices and awareness of climate change among a variety of stakeholders, \nincluding government, civil society, the media, and highly vulnerable groups such as women \nand the poor, and (ii) institutionalize the existing PPCR secretariat15 to ensure the effective \nimplementation of climate change projects beyond the duration of the PPCR.16 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be Tajikistan\u2019s increased resilience to climate variability and climate \nchange. By 2022, the number of households affected and the economic losses resulting from \ndrought, flooding, and landslides will be reduced by 20% from the 2011 baseline. The outcome \nwill be national policies and development programs incorporating safeguards to address the \neffects of climate change. By 2016, 25% of approved projects in irrigation, flood protection, \ntransport, energy, and water supply and sanitation will be climate-proofed, up from a 2011 \nbaseline of 0%. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Output 1 will make climate change information available to multiple users, producing \ntimely and reliable information on weather and climate that can be easily accessed by national \nand more local decision makers. In coordination with ongoing activities administered by the \nWorld Bank,17 a climate modeling facility will be established in the State Hydrometeorological \nServices (Hydromet) Forecast Department, procuring the hardware and software necessary to \napply high-resolution forecasting and dynamical modeling techniques18 and interpret the outputs \nfrom those models. The facility will be handed over to the government upon TA completion, in \nline  with  the  provisions  and  budgetary  allocation  indicated  in  the  State  Program  for  the \nMonitoring  of  Glaciers19 and  related  decrees.  A  management  information  system  will  be \nestablished to store and share existing and newly generated data, including disaster risks. \nTraining on how to generate and use climate data and information will be provided to local \nexperts who are already involved with hydro-meteorological data measurement and to the new \nexperts engaged by the Hydromet under the State Program for the Monitoring of Glaciers. \nAdditional  technical  skills  will  be  gained through  higher  education  curricula  enhanced  with \nclimate science and glaciology modules. The climate modeling facility will gradually be handed \nover  to  the  government  and  fully  supported  with  national  budget  after  TA  completion,  in \nalignment with the state program. Options will be explored for generating income by marketing \nweather forecast and climate information services.  \n \n8.  Output 2 will integrate climate change risks into Tajikistan\u2019s development planning and \nimplementation of development projects. It will develop tools and guidelines to climate-proof \ninvestment projects and incorporate climate change risk management in operational policies.20  \nGovernment departments will be supported in their reviewing and updating of planning and \n                                                \n15 The PPCR secretariat was established in March 2010 under the Technical Assistance for Enabling Climate Change \nInterventions in Central and West Asia (TA 7274-REG) to provide coordination and facilitate communications.  \n16 The PPCR subcommittee approved the proposed TA on 3 April 2011; the commitment letter in respect of SCF trust \nfunds for the components is expected to be issued by the SCF Trustee on 30 April 2012. \n17 World Bank. 2011.

Local adaptation \nplans  will  be  formulated  in  up  to  five  vulnerable  districts  selected  by  the  Committee  of \nEnvironmental Protection (COEP) and supported through a small grant facility to facilitate the \nparticipation of community organizations, NGOs, and vulnerable groups such as women. The \nsmall  grant  facility  will  be  able  to  support  activities  that  identify  key  climate  change \nvulnerabilities and prioritize adaptation measures through participatory approaches, the training \nof  community-based  organizations  and  local  NGOs,  and  dedicated  advisory  services  on \nadaptation. The COEP and the PPCR secretariat will facilitate the inclusion of lessons learned \nand knowledge into a risk management system supported by the national budget to ensure that \ndevelopment  projects  are  screened  for  climate  change  risks  and  that  climate  change  risk \nmanagement is systematically incorporated into technical guidelines and sector policy. \n \n9.  Output 3 will develop and apply knowledge management systems for climate change, \nestablishing systems for storing and sharing knowledge on the impacts of climate change in key \nsectors and on potential national and more local adaptation measures. By TA completion, \ngovernment  and  other  stakeholders  will  have  deeper  knowledge  of  and  more  access  to \ninformation on climate change risks and adaptation options in Tajikistan. The general public, \nincluding  remote  communities,  will  be  able  to  use  the  knowledge  to  choose  their  coping \nstrategies. Women and other disadvantaged groups will have better access to information about \nadaptation options and the support available to assist them in implementing those changes. The \nPPCR secretariat will be able to manage and disseminate knowledge to address the needs of \nstakeholders. \n \n10.  Output 4 will ensure that the other outputs of the PPCR are managed for results. It will \nmonitor the progress of the six PPCR (Phase 2) activities21 under a single reporting framework \nto optimize shared learning among lead agencies and harmonize the monitoring and reporting \nof all climate change resilience initiatives in the country. A climate change results framework will \nbe prepared and include baseline data, target indicators, and gender-sensitive indicators to \nmeasure  the  effectiveness  of  the  government\u2019s  programs  for  strengthening  Tajikistan\u2019s \nresilience to climate change. The framework will align with the PPCR results framework and \nbuild on the country\u2019s experience in results management. The development of the  climate \nchange results framework will involve all implementing agencies of the SPCR and other climate \nresilience programs, as well as civil society and development partners. The COEP will be \nresponsible for coordinating the framework, with the support of the PPCR secretariat. \n \n11.  Output 5 will develop the PPCR secretariat into a national implementing entity to ensure \nthat Tajikistan can use the knowledge and competences acquired in outputs 1\u20134 to leverage \nadditional financial support and implement climate change projects beyond the life of the PPCR. \nThe TA will formulate an exit strategy, endorsed by the government and including budgetary \nallocation,22 to ensure that the PPCR secretariat develops into an appropriate government unit \nwith trained permanent government experts. The TA will conduct assessments, consultations, \n                                                \n21 PPCR Phase 2 activities are: (i) Building Climate Resilience in the Pyanj River Basin, administered by ADB; (ii) \nEnhancing the Climate Resilience of the Energy Sector, administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand  Development;  and  (iii)  Improvement  of  Weather,  Climate,  and  Hydrological  Service  Delivery  and  (iv) \nAgriculture and Sustainable Land Management, administered by the World Bank.  \nClimate  Investment  Funds.  2010.

It will support the PPCR secretariat\u2019s process seeking accreditation by the \nAdaptation Fund Board and Accreditation Panel of the Kyoto Protocol, which will  give the \ngovernment direct access to the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund, and other financial \narrangements that may emerge from a post-2012 international agreement on climate change.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $6,000,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the ADB Strategic Climate Fund23 and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide in-kind contributions comprising personnel participation and office space with electricity, \ninternet, and telephone facilities. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The executing agencies will be the COEP and Hydromet. The COEP will oversee the TA \nas a whole and be responsible for outputs 2\u20135. Hydromet will be responsible for output 1. The \nchair of the COEP will act as the national project director and designate two national project \nmanagers at the director level, one from the COEP for outputs 2\u20135 and one from Hydromet for \noutput 1. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 4 years starting in August 2012 with the mobilization of \nconsultants. ADB will recruit consulting firm(s) to provide 70 person-months of international and \n397 person-months of national consulting services. In addition, ADB will recruit three individual \nconsultants to provide 144 person-months of national consulting services to support the PPCR \nsecretariat\u2019s core functions. As the TA requires relatively new areas of expertise and is highly \ncomplex,  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  will  be  weighted  90:10  quality\u2013cost,  and  a  full \ntechnical  proposal  will  be  used  in  engaging  the  consulting  firm(s).  ADB  will  engage  the \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). TA disbursements will be made in accordance with the Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Required expertise includes (i) \nclimate change modeling; (ii) climate risk management; (iii) climate change economics; (iv) \ncapacity  building;  (v)  information  technology  and  knowledge  management;  (vi)  public \nparticipation, gender, and social development; (vii) communications, workshop organization, \nand training; (viii) monitoring and evaluation; and (ix) financial management and procurement. \nThe consulting firm(s) will develop the operational modalities of the proposed small grant facility \nin accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook and in dialogue with the \nCOEP, PPCR secretariat, and local governments of the five districts selected for the preparation \nof local adaptation plans. The executing agencies will procure other inputs, including equipment, \nin accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.
