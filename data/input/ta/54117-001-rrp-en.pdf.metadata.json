THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed  \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Disaster Resilience Improvement Program. \n \n2.  The program is an integral part of Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) support to the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to enhance environmental sustainability; disaster and climate resilience; and \nhuman capital development, including health and gender equality. The program is aligned with \nIndonesia\u2019s  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN),  2020\u20132024.1 It  supports \nreforms in disaster risk management and health services and will help manage the fiscal risks \narising from future disasters triggered by natural hazards and pandemics. The program reflects \nthe prioritization of addressing climate change and disaster risk mitigation in the forthcoming \ncountry partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024.2 The program supports ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 operational priorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (operational \npriority 1); accelerating progress in gender equality (operational priority 2); tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability \n(operational priority 3); strengthening governance and institutional capacity (operational priority \n6); and fostering regional cooperation and integration (operational priority 7). \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Disaster risk. From 1999 to 2018, 264 disaster events were reported in Indonesia, with \n792,106 people affected per year on average and 186,758 lives lost.3 From 2000 to 2016, \naverage annual losses of $1.5 billion were recorded.4 Climate-related extreme events such as \nlandslides, floods, and droughts have increased in frequency and magnitude, and much of the \ninfrastructure is inadequate to cope with such events. In the past two years alone (since 2018), \nIndonesia has experienced a succession of deadly disasters: (i) in August 2018, a 7.0-magnitude \nearthquake  hit  Lombok  in  West  Nusa  Tenggara;  (ii)  in  September  2018,  a  7.4-magnitude \nearthquake triggered a near-field tsunami, landslides, and major liquefaction in Central Sulawesi; \n(iii) in December  2018, another tsunami caused by a volcanic eruption struck Sunda Strait; and \n(iv) in November 2019, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit near the Maluku Islands and North \nSulawesi. Previous disasters in Indonesia have shown women and girls to be at a greater \ndisadvantage due to the limited involvement of women in disaster monitoring and rapid response, \nand religious and cultural norms that do not encourage their readiness for natural hazards.5 \nClimate change is set to increase the frequency and severity of extreme climate events in the \nfuture. Rapid demographic and economic growth in hazard-prone areas, including coastal cities, \nare also expected to increase exposure to natural hazards, contributing to continuing high levels \nof disaster risk.  \n \n \n1  National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2019.

The government\u2019s disaster risk management reform agenda. Indonesia requires \nsubstantial financing to manage its disaster risks, and strengthening financial preparedness for \ndisasters will facilitate more timely early recovery and reconstruction efforts. This, in turn, will \nallow the government to develop recovery plans with greater certainty and reduce the indirect \nsocial and economic consequences of direct physical damage and losses, and loss of life. In \nOctober 2018, the government launched its Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) \nStrategy (see figure).6 This strategy comprises short- and medium-term implementation priorities \nto provide sustainable and efficient DRFI mechanisms for timely, well-targeted, and transparent \nassistance  following  disasters.  The  five  key  targets  of  the  DRFI  Strategy  are  as  follows:  \n(i) combining financing instruments; (ii) retaining or absorbing risk through the national and \nsubnational budgets for high-frequency and low-severity disaster events; (iii) using contingent \nfinancing  instruments  to  complement  the  national  budget  to  address  medium-risk  and  \nmedium-frequency disaster events; (iv) developing a pooling fund to facilitate the accrual of \nunspent fiscal budget allocations for disaster response in years of lower loss; and (v) using risk \ntransfer instruments such as insurance for low-frequency and high-severity disaster events. The \nnational and subnational governments make annual budget allocations for post-disaster response \nand disaster risk management more broadly.7 However, in practice, most disaster response \nfunding is provided by the national government and included in the annual national budget. \nNational  government  funding  for  disaster  response  is  channeled  through  on-call  funds  for \nemergency response, allocated by the National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB). \n \n   \nRisk Layering of Indonesia\u2019s Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Strategy \n \n \n \nLow High\n \n \n  Residual Risk (International Assistance)\n \n \nCatastrophe Insurance\n  r\n    uency Risk Transfe HInosuusreahnocled  PIunbsluicr aAnscseet  oss\n  eq L\nr\n  F Contingent Credit\n  n\n  sk ntio Pooling Fund\n  Riete\n  R\nBudget Allocation and Reallocation\n \n \nHigh Low\n     Source: Government of Indonesia, Ministry of Finance.   \n \n5.  Public health management and the COVID-19 pandemic. Indonesia has significantly \nimproved its public health indicators since the 1980s. Life expectancy at birth rose from 58.0 years \nin 1980 to 71.3 years in 2017 and is expected to reach 72.4 by 2035.8  The prevalence of \ntuberculosis declined from 263 per 100,000 people in 2015 to 202 per 100,000 people in 2018.9 \nIndonesia\u2019s polio-free status was maintained for 13 years before the disease returned in 2019 \n \n6  Government of Indonesia, Ministry of Finance (MOF). 2018.

Jakarta. \n ", "3 \nbecause of the low vaccination coverage in the Papua region.10 However, the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic presents a new health challenge for Indonesia. As of 20 August 2020, \nIndonesia had 147,211 positive cases and 6,418 deaths; the Special Capital Region of Jakarta \nwas the hardest hit region with 30,465 cases and 1,014 deaths, followed by East Java with  \n28,551 cases and 2,055 deaths.11 These figures may not reflect the complete picture because of \nthe low number of tests administered.  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that \nthe Ministry of Health (MOH) support sentinel surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections \nand influenza-like illnesses as part of the surveillance strategy to increase the likelihood of \ndetecting COVID-19.12 \n \n6.  COVID-19 has put a significant strain on the Indonesian economy. Prior to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, gross domestic product (GDP) growth was robust, averaging 5% during \n2013\u20132019. Fiscal deficits were low, below the legally stipulated ceiling of 3% of GDP, and \nIndonesia\u2019s external and public debt was moderate and sustainable.13 Inflation had been at the \nlower end of Bank Indonesia\u2019s target range, and international reserves remained ample to cover \nimports  and  debt  repayment.  However,  public  health  measures  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  \nCOVID-19  have  seriously  disrupted  economic  activity,  leading  to  a  projected  economic \ncontraction of 1% in 2020, the lowest GDP growth rate in 21 years, down from an original growth \nestimate of 5.2%.14 The ongoing crisis has also had a significant impact on livelihoods, especially \nwithin  the  most  vulnerable  communities.  The  government  estimates  that  up  to  5.2  million \nIndonesians could lose their jobs due to the COVID-19-induced economic slowdown. Close to  \n10 million people are at risk of falling below the national poverty line, with poverty incidence \nexpected to increase from 9.4% in March 2019 to 11.9%\u201312.8% in 2020.15 \n \n7.  The government\u2019s response to COVID-19. On 28 January 2020, the government \nthrough the head of the BNPB issued a disaster emergency decree until 28 February 2020 and \nallocated national funds to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This was further extended until 29 May \n2020. In March 2020, the government announced a $32.4 billion package for urgently needed \nhealth, social assistance, and economic support measures.16 On 31 March 2020, the President \nissued a decree to declare COVID-19 as a public health emergency and issued a separate \nregulation  on  large-scale  social  distancing  which  was  enforced  across  4  provinces  and  \n24 districts. On 13 April 2020, the President also declared COVID-19 a non-natural national \ndisaster.17 On 20 April 2020, the MOH approved the national response plan for COVID-19. \nSubsequently, the government has further increased the stimulus package. With the substantial \nCOVID-19  response  package,  the  government  has temporarily relaxed  the  3% fiscal  deficit \nceiling requirement (para. 15), and in June 2020 raised its 2020 budget deficit estimate to 6.34% \nof GDP, from the previous estimate of 5.07% of GDP in March 2020.18 On 20 July 2020, the \ngovernment issued Presidential Regulation No. 82/2020 to establish the Committee for the \n \n10 John Hopkins Center for Health Security, Outbreak Observatory. 2019.

Climate  risk  and  its  impact  on  health.  Climate  change  causes  hydrological  and \nmeteorological disasters that increase public health risks from climate-sensitive diseases. Such \ndiseases may cause certain segments of the population to be more vulnerable to epidemics and \npandemics. Responding to the impact of disasters and epidemics requires addressing underlying \nvulnerabilities such as poverty, limited social safety nets, weak health systems, and structural \ngender inequalities. Resilient healthcare systems adapt and respond effectively to pandemics and \ndiseases caused by climate change, such as respiratory ailments.19 \n \n9.  Development constraints. While the magnitude of natural hazards and pandemics is \noutside the control of any government, their impact is dependent on the exposure and vulnerability \nof a country\u2019s economy and people. In Indonesia, first of all, low prioritization of climate resilience, \ndisaster risk management, and health and social protection measures in national development \nplans restrict climate and disaster resilience and limit the provision of healthcare facilities, \ninformation technology, and financial, policy, and human resources to respond to pandemics and \ndisasters. Further, women and other marginalized groups are rarely in positions of power in \nhouseholds and communities to influence and contribute to disaster response and recovery \ndecisions. These constraints result in delays in early recovery and rehabilitation and exacerbate \nthe economic and social impacts of physical losses following disasters and pandemics. They also \ncause a strain on health services by limiting testing, case management, and reporting capacity, \nwhich cause onward transmission of disease. Second, inadequate climate- and disaster-resilient \nplanning, intra-agency and interagency coordination, construction of priority innovative public \ninfrastructure, and information systems delay the achievement of the Sustainable Development \nGoals. Third, limited financing capacity and sovereign debt management for disaster risk and \npandemic  preparedness  and  response,  as  evidenced  by  the  limited  use  of  risk  transfer \n(insurance) and capital market instruments, lead to reallocation of core development spending or \nthe requirement of supplementary budgets, which delay achievement of development targets.20 \n \n10.  Lessons learned. The program reflects several lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience \nin providing post-disaster support to Indonesia (para. 18) and contingent disaster financing (CDF) \nto ADB\u2019s developing member countries in the Pacific. First, contingent financing is most effective \nas part of a broader disaster risk financing framework, complementing other risk retention and \nrisk  transfer  instruments.21 Second,  policy  reforms  should  focus  on  enhancing  long-term \nresilience to natural hazards and pandemics to reduce their social, health, and economic impact. \nThird,  technical  assistance  (TA)  should  be  provided  in  a  timely  manner  and  with  strong \ncoordination among development partners to help the government achieve ambitious reform \n \n19 P. Bhandari and A. S. Roy. 2020. The response to COVID-19 should also be a response to the climate crisis. ADB \nAsian Development Blog. 16 April. \n20 National budget allocations for the Indonesia\u2019s disaster contingency fund averaged IDR3.1 trillion ($300 million) \nannually  during  2005\u20132017,  while  disaster  losses  averaged  IDR22.84  billion  ($1.5  billion)  annually  during  \n2000\u20132016. \n21 Other risk retention measures may include annual contingency budgeting and budget reallocations, and risk transfer \ninstruments may include insurance, reinsurance, and insurance-linked securities. \n ", "5 \ntargets. Fourth, coordination and capacity constraints that are likely to delay fiscal transfers during \nan emergency should be addressed. Fifth, policy-based lending should focus on sectors where \ninvestment loans are provided and ADB has experience, to ensure that policy constraints are \naddressed by relevant policy reforms.22 Sixth, a framework for monitoring program performance \nis important for effective program implementation and loan renewal. Seventh, policy-based \ndisaster risk management programs allow ADB and other development partners to engage in \nstrategic policy dialogue with the government, and to ensure that financial dimensions of disaster \nrisk are incorporated in the disaster risk management system and that the costs and benefits of \nthe proposed solutions are assessed appropriately. \n  \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n 11.  The program design and reform discussions reflect insights on disaster preparedness that \nADB has gained from its post-disaster reconstruction and disaster and climate risk reduction \nlending and TA operations (including on disaster insurance) in Indonesia. The proposed program \nwill complement the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program for \nIndonesia by strengthening the disaster resilience of Indonesian institutions and communities, \nand  the  government\u2019s  response  to  pandemics  through  three  reform  areas:  (i)  policy  and \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  disaster  risk  management  and  health-related  emergencies, \nincluding social protection; (ii) resilience of physical assets to disaster and climate risks; and  \n(iii)  disaster  risk  and  pandemic  response  financing.  The  CARES  Program  supported  the \ngovernment\u2019s COVID-19 fiscal response plan announced on 31 March 2020.23 The proposed \nprogram supports medium-term pandemic response reforms beyond the immediate COVID-19 \nresponse measures supported by the CARES Program.24 The proposed program responds \ndirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic with support for urgent response measures required by the \ngovernment to prepare for a worsened COVID-19 situation and control of the health-related \nimpacts of the pandemic (para. 13).25 All prior actions were accomplished. \n \n12.  Reform area 1: Policy and institutional arrangements for disaster risk management. \nIn 2019, the government strengthened institutional policies and action plans and adopted its \nRPJMN,  2020\u20132024,  which  incorporates climate  resilience,  disaster  risk  management,  and \ngender goals, indicators, and targets (footnote 1).26 Climate budget tagging will strengthen public \nfinancial  management,  allowing  the  government  to  (i)  plan,  identify,  prioritize,  and  report  \n \n22 Independent Evaluation Department. 2018. Policy-Based Lending 2008\u20132017: Performance, Results, and Issues of \nDesign. Manila: ADB. The proposed program includes reforms in flood risk management, an area where ADB is \ncurrently financing projects. It also supports the management of fiscal transfers and administration of public assets \nat the subnational government level, which will facilitate the establishment of a disaster risk insurance pool, a target \narea for future ADB investment lending.  \n23 ADB. 2020.

ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Policy Paper. Manila.   \n26 The RPJMN\u2019s 2024 targets at the national level include the following: (i) improved delivery time of disaster early \nwarning systems to the public from 5 minutes to 3 minutes; (ii) increased investment in disaster risk management in \nthe state budget, from 0.04% to 1.36% of the state budget; and (iii) a decrease of 1.25% of GDP in climate and \ndisaster damage and loss. The RPJMN\u2019s appendixes include gender and climate commitments, including (i) \ninstitutional strengthening to promote the protection of women's rights in emergency situations and special conditions; \n(ii) services to empower women in emergency situations and special conditions; (iii) guidelines to enhance the \nresilience of women to disasters; and (iv) communication, information, and education materials to enhance the \nresilience of women to disasters disseminated through various media. \n ", "6 \nclimate-related expenditures; and (ii) identify funding gaps and under-resourced priorities in the \nRPJMN. Climate budget tagging is also a key element in mobilizing financing through green \nbonds.  Following a government regulation mandating climate budget tagging at the subnational \nlevel, a group of four provinces and districts started climate budget tagging projects. The \ngovernment, led by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), has embarked on a plan, with the help of ADB \nand other development partners, to ensure that more subnational budgets are climate-tagged in \nthe medium term.  \n \n13.  Policy and institutional arrangements for health-related emergencies, including \nsocial protection. The government institutionalized action plans that provide financial and human \nresources to respond to COVID-19 and future pandemics. First, to promote effective coordination \nof the government\u2019s response and its efforts to prevent and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic at \nthe  national  and  subnational  levels,  the  government  established  the  Task  Force  for  the \nAcceleration of the Handling of COVID-19. The task force is led by the head of the BNPB. It \nincludes  key  stakeholder  agencies  such  as  the  MOH,  the  Indonesian  National  Police,  the \nIndonesian National Army, the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, the Ministry of Human \nDevelopment  and  Culture,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Housing  (MPWH),  regional \ngovernments, and the Ministry of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection (MOWECP).27 \nSecond, led by the MOH, the government strengthened pandemic and epidemic reporting \ncapacity across government agencies by issuing guidelines for a single reporting system, which \nintegrates disaggregated data from hospitals, provinces, and the MOH Center for Data and \nInformation. Better reporting will improve case management and data transparency and elicit \nappropriate  levels  of  government  intervention  and  public  response.  To  standardize  testing \nprotocols and processes, the government issued guidelines for testing and treatment of COVID-\n19, future pandemics, and disease outbreaks. To strengthen social protection measures that \nsupport  women  in  the  workplace  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  MOWECP  issued \nRegulation No. 1 of 2020, which outlines procedures for the protection of female workers. The \nMOWECP also allocated $19.5 million for referral services to women victims of violence and to \nchildren in need of special protection, and strengthened its provision of essential services to \nwomen, children, the elderly, and migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the \nMOH adopted decree nos. 214 and 216, and circular no. 234 of 2020 to establish a national \nlaboratory network and increase the number of laboratories to improve the country\u2019s testing \ncapacity for COVID-19 and future pandemics as a prerequisite to normalizing the economy. \n \n14.  Reform area 2: Resilience of physical assets to disaster and climate risks. Ensuring \nthe resilience of infrastructure and coordinating disaster response across key ministries (while \nconsidering the gendered impacts of disaster and climate change) are imperative to reduce the \ncost of replacing or restoring public infrastructure. To promote protection of vulnerable groups \nfollowing disasters and effective coordination within the MPWH and across government agencies \ninvolved  in  disaster  response,  the  MPWH  revised  its  disaster  committee  Decree  No. \n1176/KPTS/M/2019. This revised decree assigned key personnel and task forces to critical \ndisaster response roles (such as the chief of the disaster committee and the disaster task force \nsecretary) and provided resource coordination for highways and provinces. In addition, to account \nfor and enhance disaster and climate resilience of water resource infrastructure, following the  \nADB-supported development of a national asset management inventory and upgrading of the \n \n27 Presidential Decree No. 7 of 2020 was issued on 13 March 2020 and revised on 20 March 2020 (Presidential Decree \nNo. 9 of 2020). On 20 July 2020, Presidential Regulation No. 82/2020 was issued, replacing Presidential Decrees \nNo. 7 and No. 9 of 2020. \n ", "7 \ninformation system platform for irrigation infrastructure,28 the MPWH signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding with ADB, completed key milestones for similar projects for river and water supply \ninfrastructure, and established 136 community-based disaster management organizations in \nBanten and Maluku provinces (with women holding approximately 20% of managerial positions). \n \n15.  Reform area 3: Disaster risk and pandemic response financing. Building resilience \nthrough  insured  infrastructure,  improved  healthcare,  and  targeted  social  spending\u2014\ncomplemented by the use of financial mechanisms\u2014ensures effective disaster and pandemic \npreparedness and response. In 2019, the government, supported by the World Bank, established \na state-owned asset indemnity insurance pilot project to insure the MOF\u2019s buildings against \ndisasters. Following this, the government expanded the scope of the public asset insurance \nprogram to include the participation of two additional government agencies: the National Public \nProcurement Agency and the National Government Internal Auditor. For its COVID-19 response, \nthe government announced a $45.7 billion emergency stimulus package focusing on health, social \nprotection, and economic assistance to businesses and local government programs. To support \nthis, the government adjusted its fiscal rules by relaxing the state budget deficit policy to allow the \nfiscal deficit to exceed 3% of GDP for 3 fiscal years.29 \n \n16.   Post-program partnership framework for disaster risk management. To ensure the \ncontinuity  of  reforms  and  to  strengthen  policy  and  institutional  arrangements,  the  program \nincorporates a post-program partnership framework (PPPF). Under the PPPF, the climate tagging \nof subnational government budgets, gender and climate tagging of national government agency \nbudgets,  and  disaster  risk  reduction  tagging  of  national  government  expenditures  will  be \nstrengthened. The MPWH will improve flood risk management and investment by preparing \ngender-responsive risk management plans for at least six river basins. The government will \nfinalize the legal process to adopt standards for seismic loading (Indonesian national standard no. \n1726) and reinforced concrete structural design (Indonesian national standard no. 2847), and \nrevise its technical standards for earthquake resilience of irrigation infrastructure. The government \nwill also strengthen disaster resilience of national highways and bridges and develop a gender-\nresponsive emergency road response plan. The PPPF will strengthen the fiscal resilience of \nsubnational governments to disasters to eventually provide sustainable and efficient disaster risk \nfinancing mechanisms for timely, well-targeted, and transparent post-disaster recovery and \nreconstruction. This will include the management of financing sources for disaster relief and \nrecovery (including fiscal transfers), which will improve the quality of subnational government \nasset registers and country disaster risk data. ADB has secured $1 million in funding for TA, \nprovided by Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), to support the PPPF.30 \n \n17.  Post-program partnership framework for pandemic response. The government will \nimplement  its  testing  capacity  policy  with  gender-responsive  monitoring  and  surveillance \nmeasures, preparation of a draft national roadmap on COVID-19 vaccine development, and \nhuman resource capacity building of healthcare workers to strengthen the national laboratory \nnetwork. The testing capacity policy will enhance the government\u2019s capacity for timely and \ntransparent data sharing with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) neighbors. \nThe government will develop national guidelines to promote the safety and security of men and \n \n28 ADB. 2017.

ADB\u2019s  experience  and  value  addition  in  disaster  risk  management.  ADB  has \nextended significant disaster-related support to Indonesia dating back to the 2004 Indian Ocean \ntsunami.31 A key lesson learned from that project is that effective post-disaster infrastructure \nreconstruction requires careful assessment, planning, and preparation if the needs and priorities \nof reconstruction are to be properly addressed. The program fulfills the dual objectives of \nsupporting fundamental disaster risk reduction reforms and providing quick-disbursing financing \nfor disaster preparedness and response (recovery and reconstruction). ADB has supported the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to strengthen disaster risk management capabilities, including in the area of \nflood risk management.32 ADB partnered with the European Space Agency and other knowledge \nand technology providers to introduce web-based asset management information systems for \nwater resources infrastructure, light detection, and ranging to improve survey and planning \nprocesses  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  assets,  and  nature-based  solutions  for  water \nresources management. ADB provided TA to help the National Development Planning Agency \n(BAPPENAS) and other line agencies to strengthen resilience in urban development. Following \nthe 2018 disasters in Lombok and Central Sulawesi (para. 3), ADB immediately responded by \napproving a $500 million loan to finance immediate and  short-term needs such as livelihood \nassistance and temporary schools.33 Subsequently, in 2019 ADB approved the Emergency \nAssistance for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction loans of $297.75 million and TA to support \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of water resources, water supply, and education infrastructure; \nand ports and an airport in Central Sulawesi using build-back-better principles.34 \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s value addition in response to COVID-19 and social assistance. ADB works \nclosely with the BNPB, the MOH, WHO, and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) on the \ndelivery of critical medical equipment and supplies through a $3 million grant under the Asia \nPacific  Disaster  Response  Fund.35  ADB  is  supporting  social  protection  in  Indonesia  by \nstrengthening the capacity of social protection and employment program facilitators, and advising \non maintaining supplies of basic food and personal protective equipment. On 23 April 2020, ADB \napproved  the  $1.5  billion  CARES  Program,  cofinanced  with  $750  million  from  the  Asian \nInfrastructure Investment Bank, \u20ac250 million from German development cooperation through \nKfW, and \u00a550 billion from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (footnote 23). ADB\u2019s  \n$5 million regional technical assistance for policy advice for COVID-19 economic recovery in \nSoutheast Asia is providing financing, policy dialogue and knowledge solutions to the government, \nincluding hosting events with ASEAN government officials and experts, which address the \nimmediate health and economic impacts and the economic recovery phase. 36 ADB is closely \nengaging with the MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency to jointly analyze and monitor the socioeconomic \nimpacts of COVID-19, and will provide a bespoke coordination and monitoring framework to \nsupport effective implementation of the CARES Program for Indonesia. \n \n \n31 ADB. 2005.

While preparing \nthis  program,  ADB  closely  coordinated  with  the  following  development  partners:  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement, the  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank,  DFAT,  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, the United Nations Development Programme, the United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank, and the World Food \nProgramme. ADB\u2019s lending and TA operations with disaster risk resilience components are \ncoordinated with DFAT, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank. The \nWorld Bank has been particularly active in supporting financial management of disaster response, \nbeginning with support for the development of the country\u2019s national DRFI Strategy (footnote 6 \nand figure). Indonesia is a member country of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility, \na platform established in December 2018 by ASEAN+3 and the World Bank, to provide ASEAN \ncountries with financial solutions and technical advice to increase their financial resilience to \nclimate and disaster risks. ADB is a technical working group member of the Southeast Asia \nDisaster Risk Insurance Facility. \n \n21.   Development  partner  coordination  for  COVID-19  response.  Health-  and  \npandemic-related reforms and support for the PPPF targets were discussed with the following \ndevelopment partners: the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, DFAT, the European Union \n(through the European External Action Service), the Government of Canada, UNICEF, USAID, \nthe World Bank, and the World Food Programme. ADB is closely coordinating its COVID-19 \nresponse support with development partners, including the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank on macroeconomic monitoring and surveillance. The WHO is the lead partner on \npublic health policy response, supported by DFAT, UNICEF, USAID, and the World Bank. \n \nC.  Impact of the Reform \n \n22.  In line with the RPJMN, 2020\u20132024 (footnote 1), the program has the following impact: \ndisaster and climate resilience enhanced, and health services improved, including advancement \ntoward universal health coverage. The impact of the program is demonstrated through the \nperformance indicators in the design and monitoring framework.37 The program will have the \nfollowing outcome: disaster resilience and pandemic response of institutions and communities \nstrengthened, and financial preparedness for disasters and pandemics improved. The program \nimpact assessment concludes that the reforms achieved under the program are expected to \nmitigate $562.5 million\u2013$1,069.3 million of damage and losses from natural hazards at present \nvalue, accrued during 2020\u20132025.38 Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to cause \neconomic losses of $60.1 billion, or 5.8% of GDP.39 The benefits result from the government\u2019s \nrapid access to resources that would enable it to initiate timely disaster and pandemic response, \nthereby mitigating the indirect economic and social impact of disasters and pandemics. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n \n23. The government has requested a loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement.  The  government  has  chosen  option  1  of  the  CDF  policy  where,  upon  loan \n \n37 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n38 The reduction in losses does not explicitly capture the economic benefits of reforms in the context of COVID-19. \nAlthough GDP might have included these impacts at the macro level, they are not being captured through the \nprogram. As such, the range of expected benefits is conservative in nature. \n39 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \neffectiveness, the committed CDF amount will be available for disbursement immediately after a \ndisaster occurs.40 The government will pay a one-time front-end fee of 0.25% of the committed \nloan amount, which may be financed out of the loan proceeds. If the undisbursed loan amount is \nrenewed for an additional 3-year loan availability period (up to four times), the borrower will pay \neach time a fee of 0.25% of the renewal amount (up to the undisbursed loan balance), which may \nalso be financed out of the loan proceeds. The loan size is based on Indonesia\u2019s financing needs \nand  development  spending  in  conjunction  with  the  reforms.  The  shocks  arising  from  the  \nCOVID-19 pandemic severely impact the government\u2019s fiscal position and give rise to urgent and \nlarge near-term financing needs. The government\u2019s projected gross financing requirement for \n2020 is estimated at $106 billion. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.   Institutional arrangements. The MOF will be the program\u2019s executing agency and will \noversee and coordinate the timely implementation of the program. The implementing agencies \nwill be BAPPENAS, BNPB, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, the MOF, the MOH, the \nMinistry of Home Affairs, the MPWH, and the MOWECP. The program will be completed in \nDecember 2023. Renewal is subject to reconfirmation of the adequacy of the macroeconomic \nenvironment, Indonesia\u2019s continued progress toward the PPPF, and an updated PPPF with \nmutually agreed objectives for the subsequent availability period. The renewal may also be \naffected by changes in country classification during the program period. \n \n25.   Disbursement  triggers  and  approach.  Disbursement  triggers  will  not  be  applied \nretroactively. For natural disasters, withdrawal requests will be deferred until the President of \nIndonesia or the governor of an affected province has declared a state of emergency pursuant to \nLaw No. 24/2007, Article 51. For health-related emergencies, withdrawal requests will be deferred \nuntil the President of Indonesia has declared a public health state of emergency under Law No. \n6/2018, Article 10, or the minister of health has (i) declared an epidemic pursuant to Ministry of \nHealth Regulation No. 1501/2010, Article 11, or (ii) taken an equivalent measure including issuing \nof a decree pursuant to Ministry of Health Regulation No. 9/2020 imposing a large-scale social \ndistancing in a province. The government may withdraw the loan proceeds partially or entirely, \ndepending on its assessment of the severity of the disaster or health-related emergency and \nresulting need. Only a single withdrawal may be requested per disaster or health emergency \nevent, and the request must be received by ADB within 90 days of the declaration of a state of \nemergency, declaration of an epidemic or issuance of a ministerial decree imposing a large-scale \nsocial distancing in a province. Any unutilized funds at the conclusion of the loan availability period \ncan be disbursed to the Republic of Indonesia under the deferred disbursement option, subject to \nADB reconfirming Indonesia\u2019s continuation of policy actions and the PPPF through submission of \na progress report. Funds will be spent through national budget processes for eligible items. \nProceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will periodically monitor the \ncontinuing implementation of the policy actions and PPPF during the availability period. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n26.   Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The \nprogram is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards impacts within the \nmeaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n40 ADB. 2019. Contingent Disaster Financing under Policy-Based Lending in Response to Natural Hazards. Manila. \n ", "11 \n27.  Gender.  The  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Women  in \nIndonesia are disproportionally vulnerable to the impact of climate change and disasters with \nregard to mortality, morbidity, and economic shocks. This is because they have less access to \nkey survival and recovery resources, such as food, shelter, transport, and cash or disposable \nincome. While women in Indonesia are generally conscious of how climate change and disasters \ncan affect them and their families, they are rarely in a position to influence decisions concerning \nmeasures required to mitigate the impacts of disasters, and services or support required to return \nto normalcy.41 The vulnerability of the population is intensified by socioeconomic disparities, \nincluding gender inequality, which determines the ability of women and girls to survive and recover \nin times of crisis. \n \n28.  The government has acknowledged the importance of addressing the needs of women \nduring times of crisis as evident through: (i) the RPJMN\u2019s inclusion of gender commitments;  \n(ii) the establishment of the Task Force for the Acceleration of the Handling of COVID-19, which \nincludes the participation of the MOWECP; (iii) the allocation of budget to provide referral services \nto female survivors of violence and to children in need of special protection, and the issuance of \nguidelines to reduce the vulnerability of women, children, the elderly, and migrant workers during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic; (iv) the issuance of Regulation No. 1/2020, which outlines procedures \nfor the protection of female workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond; and (v) the more \nthan doubling of the size of the government\u2019s social assistance program (since March 2020) to \n$13.4 billion, which includes $2.9 billion for the Kartu Sembako food assistance program (96% of \nwhose  beneficiaries  are  women  and  16%  of  whom  are  female  heads  of  household),  and  \n$2.5  billion  for  the  Family  Hope  Program  (90%  of  whose  beneficiaries  are  women).  The \ngovernment will develop gender-responsive river basin flood management plans and promote the \nrobust participation of women in managerial roles in community-based disaster management \norganizations. Finally, the government will ensure the safety and security of women, girls, and \nother vulnerable groups through national gender-responsive and socially inclusive quarantine \nfacility management guidelines during public health outbreaks, and similarly for disasters. \n \n29.  Governance. The program will support the integration of disaster risk reduction, climate \nchange  action, 42 and  pandemic  response  into  national  and  local  planning,  development \nprocesses, and poverty reduction strategies. It will help to strengthen governance at the national \nand local government levels to provide quality, reliable, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure to \nsupport economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable \naccess for all. Overall, the government has strengthened its public financial management. In \n2017,  Indonesia  scored  either  A  or  B  (both  considered  above  the  basic  alignment  with \ninternational good practice) on 17 out of 31 indicators in the World Bank\u2019s public expenditure and \nfinancial  accountability  assessment  report. 43  Government  regulations  issued  in  2017 \nstrengthened the legal and regulatory frameworks for public financial management, mandating \ncoordination  between  BAPPENAS  and  the  MOF  in  planning,  budgeting,  and  subsequent \nregulations. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n30.  Poverty and social.
