INTRODUCTION \n1.  Recognizing  the  pivotal  importance  of  equal  opportunities  for  women  and  men  in \ndevelopment, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) included gender equity as one of five drivers \nof change in its Strategy 2020.1 ADB's corporate results framework requires that 40% of all ADB \nprojects and 50% of all Asian Development Fund (ADF) X-financed projects have \"significant \ngender mainstreaming\" by 2012.2  \n \n2.  A special evaluation of the relevance, responsiveness, and results of ADB's support to \ngender  and  development  (GAD)  recently  completed  by  ADB's  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment recommends (i) improving the outcome orientation of GAD goals and monitoring \nand evaluation, (ii) providing clarity to operationalize GAD goals in ADB operations in the \ncontext of Strategy 2020, and (iii) providing adequate financial resources to support policy \nimplementation.3 The special evaluation study underscored several actions to facilitate gender \nmainstreaming in ADB operations, including (i) improving the capacity of developing member \ncountries (DMCs) to systematically address gender concerns in development, (ii) assessing \ncountry-specific GAD issues and developing innovative strategies to promote gender equality, \n(iii) monitoring and evaluating projects with specific gender design features to ensure women's \nparticipation and access to project benefits, and (iv) strengthening ADB support at resident \nmissions for improving gender mainstreaming performance. \n \n3.  The proposed technical assistance (TA)4 will strengthen the capacity of DMCs in Central \nand West Asia to (i) apply gender mainstreaming strategies in the design and implementation of \nprojects and programs, (ii) support innovative and strategic approaches in the DMCs to promote \ngender equality and women's empowerment, and (iii) promote partnership and cooperation to \nenhance synergy. Activities will be supported through core areas of operations of ADB's Central \nand West Asia Department (CWRD), in which country-specific, innovative, and effective design \nfeatures will be developed to provide equal opportunity for women and men to participate in and \nbenefit from projects and programs. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The  gender  mainstreaming  strategy  introduced  under  ADB's  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998) has contributed to progress in addressing gender concerns through ADB's \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) and its lending and nonlending activities in DMCs in Central \nand West Asia. However, gaps and weaknesses in policy implementation continue. For instance, \nthe  lack  of  clear  gender  targets  and  performance-monitoring  indicators  in  CPS  results \nframeworks  and  project  design-and-monitoring  frameworks  undermined  CWRD  and  ADB \nsupport at the level of both policy and operations of promoting gender equality and women's \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB loans and grants fall into four categories (i) gender equity theme, (ii) effective gender mainstreaming, (iii) \nsome gender benefits, and (iv) no notable gender elements. The first two categories combined are referred to as \nprojects with \u2015significant gender mainstreaming.\u2016 Until 2008, the data measured the number of loans and ADF \ngrants. From 2009 onwards, for the purpose of ADB-wide consistency, the data refers to the number of \"projects,\" \nwhich refers to (i) ordinary capital resources loans, (ii) ADF loans, (iii) ADF grants, and (iv) technical assistance \nprojects. The term includes both projects and programs. The rating categories have been used since 1998 to \nmonitor ADB's gender performance and were updated and clarified by the interdepartmental Technical Working \nGroup on Gender Mainstreaming in ADB Operations in 2009. \n3  ADB. 2010. Special Evaluation Study on the Asian Development Bank's Support to Gender and Development \u2013 \nPhase I: Relevance, Responsiveness, and Results to Date. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 May 2010. \n ", "2     \n \nempowerment and of gender impact assessment. In 2009, only 28% of CWRD's approved \nprogram and project loans were categorized as having \"effective gender mainstreaming,\" while \nnone met the criteria of a \"gender equity theme.\" 5  \n \n5.  Gender mainstreaming in CWRD operations faces several challenges: (i) infrastructure \nproject design (e.g., for transport and energy) that normally does not easily accommodate \ngender mainstreaming; (ii) weak GAD strategies in CPSs and fewer projects that can directly \naddress gender equality or women's empowerment (e.g., social services and basic rural and \nurban infrastructure); (iii) insufficient financial and technical capacity in DMCs to develop and \nadopt innovative and gender-responsive approaches to promote gender-inclusive economic \ngrowth; and (iv) too few GAD experts in resident missions (10 under CWRD) to support DMCs\u2019 \ngender mainstreaming of ADB-financed projects.6 Foremost among the challenges is insufficient \ncapacity in DMCs to apply gender mainstreaming strategies in the design and implementation of \nprograms and projects. \n \n6.  A two-pronged approach in each country will be considered to tackle these challenges: (i) \na  top\u2013down  approach  with  emphasis  on  capacity  development  in  government  agencies \n(including ministries of women and project executing and implementing agencies) in developing \nand implementing gender-mainstreaming strategies and in monitoring and assessing gender \nequality results and (ii) a bottom\u2013up approach to include women as active partners in ADB-\nfinanced projects, empowering them through opportunities in gender-inclusive project planning, \ndesign, and implementation, thus improving women's access to and benefit from development \nprojects.  \n \n7.  Both approaches need in-depth country-specific gender assessments to identify entry \npoints. In the transitional economies of the former Soviet Union, the emphasis will be put on \nhow independence has affected men and women differently. Gender disparities in income and \nsocial  status  have  emerged  where  egalitarianism  was  once  a  defining  principle  of  official \ncommunist ideology. Widening gender gaps can now be observed in economic opportunities, \naccess  to  social  services,  and  decision  making.  In  Pakistan,  culturally  founded  gender \ndisparities call for support in implementing Pakistan\u2019s national gender reform action plan and \nfollow-up activities. Afghanistan will benefit from assistance to improve women's access to basic \nservices and enable them to participate in national reconstruction. It is important when analyzing \ngender issues to keep in view country-specific culture and tradition and, in the context of \ncountries\u2019 economic profile, to identify appropriate entry points for gender mainstreaming.  \n \n8.  Gender mainstreaming requires the identification and adoption of innovative approaches \nin CWRD operations. This is the case especially in sectors and/or projects that do not lend \nthemselves easily to gender mainstreaming. Further, as Strategy 2020 emphasizes increased \nprivate sector operations to sustain economic growth in the long run, there is a need to develop \nand scale up innovative approaches to gender mainstreaming in public\u2013private partnership \nprojects. \n \n9.  In-country consultations with government agencies, nongovernment and civil society \norganizations, and development partners found that the TA was essential to support DMCs in \nCentral and West Asia and to enable CWRD to better assist DMCs in systematically addressing \n                                                \n5  Management information system, CWRD. \n6  A local staff position on gender and development has been included in the Uzbekistan Resident Mission in 2010. \nDemand for more local staff positions on gender and development for other CWRD resident missions will be \nassessed  upon  TA  completion.  Besides,  a  GAD  expert  seconded  from  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom is expected to join CWRD by mid-2010 to support GAD work. \n ", "3 \n \ngender  concerns  in  development.  In  respect  of  the  decreasing  resources  in  the  GAD \nCooperation Fund to support GAD policy implementation in all ADB operations, the TA will pave \nthe way for CWRD to institutionalize in its own structure, mechanisms, and approaches ways to \naccelerate gender mainstreaming in its operations to meet Strategy 2020 targets. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA promotes gender-inclusive growth by helping DMCs in Central and West Asia to \nmake progress in achieving gender equality and women's empowerment, hence contributing to \nachieving Millennium Development Goals. Its outcome is to improve capacity in DMCs in gender \nmainstreaming through the planning, design, implementation, and performance monitoring of \ngender-inclusive programs and projects to improve gender equality. Increased DMC ownership \nand  application  of  GAD  strategy  in  development  projects  will  enable  more  gender \nmainstreaming in ADB-financed projects.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Output 1: Capacity to collect sex-disaggregated data is enhanced in participating \nDMCs. Sex-disaggregated statistics are largely absent, and the capacity of DMCs to collect \ndata to monitor and assess the gender impacts of programs and projects is generally weak at \nthe country, sector, and project level. External support for capacity development is urgently \nneeded to provide baseline data for reference when preparing country strategies and projects, \nmonitoring  progress,  evaluating  impact,  and  comparatively  analyzing  in-country  and  cross-\nborder  issues  and  achievements  (e.g.,  under  the  ADB-supported  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation program7). Capacity development in sex-disaggregated data collection \nwill target key government agencies tasked with national or sector- and project-specific data \ncollection,  including  the  line  ministries  and  project  executing  and  implementing  agencies \ninvolved with ADB-financed projects. A basic policy framework will be developed to integrate \nsex-disaggregated data collection in national statistical systems to ensure sustainability. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Participatory  country  gender  assessments  completed.  Participatory \ngender assessments will identify and document differences in gender roles, activities, needs, \nand  opportunities  in  specific  countries.  ADB\u2019s  first  country  gender  assessment  (CGA)  for \nArmenia and Georgia will be prepared using a participatory approach that includes stakeholder \nconsultations and workshops to ensure inclusiveness and awareness at all levels. The CGAs \nwill conduct gender issues analysis on (i) the different roles of women and men in society, \nincluding their participation in household and public economies; (ii) gender disparities in access \nto, control over, and the use of assets and productive resources; (iii) human development \nindicators; (iv) gender inequality in participation in decision-making locally and nationally; and (v) \nlaws, institutional frameworks, norms, and other social and cultural practices that cause gender \ninequality. The CGAs completed earlier with ADB assistance8 will be updated as necessary for \nCPS  preparation  and  will  support  country-  and  sector-specific  GAD  dialogue.  The  CGAs \ncompleted under the TA will be published and used as key inputs for CPS preparation.9 The \nCGAs will also provide data and information for country- and project-specific gender action \nplans, CPS results frameworks, and project design and monitoring frameworks.

Output 3: 15\u201320 gender mainstreaming pilot projects developed and implemented. \nThrough the posting of GAD experts in CWRD resident missions and the timely provision of \ntechnical support to executing agencies and ADB project staff, the TA will support DMCs in \ndeveloping and applying innovative, socially inclusive, and gender-responsive approaches to \ngender mainstreaming. One pilot subproject will be developed in each of the participating DMCs \nin year 1 and 2 of the project duration to showcase effective gender mainstreaming in sectors or \nprojects  that  do  not  lend  themselves  easily  to  gender  mainstreaming  (e.g.,  energy  and \ntransport). The subprojects may include (i) income-generating project components for women, \nespecially project components to promote women\u2019s entrepreneurship and leadership skills; (ii) \nmicrofinance  that  caters  to  women's  needs;  (iii)  public\u2013private  partnerships  that  support \nwomen's business endeavors; (iv) customer services and client-oriented project development \nand marketing; and (v) other country-specific project proposals that promote gender equality \nand women's empowerment. The pilot subprojects will be considered for financing by ADB or \nother development partners. The TA will assist the review and documentation of new and \ninnovative  approaches  to  gender  mainstreaming  in  traditional  sectors  such  as  social  and \nfinancial  services,  as  these  sectors  evolve  with  changing  economic,  social,  and  political \nenvironment  that  is  characteristic  of  economies  in  transition  in  Central  and West  Asia.  A \ncompilation  of  implemented  projects  will  be  published  to  showcase  effective  gender \nmainstreaming in participating DMCs.  \n \n14.  Output 4: GAD network reinforced and coordinated. Partnership and networking with \ndevelopment partners, local women's groups; nongovernment organizations; research institutes; \nand, where they exist, national women's associations will be supported to promote knowledge-\nsharing and synergies. In particular, close coordination and cooperation where feasible with \nother  development  partners  such  as  United  Nations  agencies,  the  World  Bank,  bilateral \ndevelopment agencies, and development partners' local consultative subgroups on GAD will \nresult in more consistent dialogue on the development and implementation of GAD policies and \nstrategies  nationally.  Innovative  and  strategic  gender  mainstreaming  approaches  will  be \ndeveloped with wider stakeholder participation to support participating DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $3,550,000, with $3,200,000 financed as a grant from \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The governments of the 10 participating \nDMCs will provide in-kind contributions totaling $350,000. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 39 months from August 2010 to November 2013, \nincluding (i) a 3-month inception period to confirm the participation of the DMCs and recruit \nconsultants and (ii) 36 months of actual TA delivery.  \n \n17.  While all DMCs in Central and West Asia are invited to participate in the TA, the extent \nand specifics of activities may vary from country to country based on local needs. ADB will be \nthe executing agency. Coordination and field activities will be assigned to consultants engaged \nindividually in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \n ", "5 \n \nfrom time to time). Disbursement under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time).  \n \n18.  To efficiently manage implementation, the DMCs will be grouped into four regions: (i) \nCentral  Asia  region  with  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan; (ii) Caucasus region with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia; (iii) Afghanistan; and \n(iv)  Pakistan.  In  each  country,  the  GAD  focal  group  comprising  government  agencies, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  other  local stakeholders  will  support TA  implementation \nthrough (i) the facilitation of government decision-making processes, (ii) cross-agency liaison \nand  assistance  in  planning  training  and  workshops,  and  (iii)  feedback  on  implementation \nprogress  for  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation.  No  TA  activity  will  commence  in  any \nparticipating DMC until the DMC provides a no-objection letter.  \n \n19.  A TA management team will be established in CWRD's Gender, Climate Change, and \nSafeguards Unit. TA coordination will be carried out by CWRD's GAD specialist, assisted by one \nnational consultant as TA coordinator and one TA administrator based at ADB headquarters. \nDMCs will be assisted by national consultants. One national consultant will be contracted as \nsubregional project manager to coordinate and monitor TA implementation in Central Asia and \nin  the  Caucasus  region  from  ADB's  office  in  Almaty,  Kazakhstan.  The  coordination  and \nmonitoring of TA implementation in Afghanistan and Pakistan will be done through the resident \nmissions. Eight national consultants will be required for a total of 231 person-months, as will 3 \ninternational consultants be engaged intermittently for a total of 18 person-months. The use of \nindividual consultants was adopted due to the nature of the TA, which aims to develop the \ncapacity of the DMCs by strengthening ADB support at resident missions. All CWRD resident \nmissions have been consulted and will provide administrative and logistical support for TA \nimplementation. \n \n20.  TA review will be conducted by region annually or as needed. A brief review will be \nundertaken following TA inception to assess DMC participation and update key outputs and \nactivities as necessary. A full accomplishment assessment will be undertaken at TA completion \nto report on progress in gender mainstreaming in CWRD operations under the new institutional \nmechanism introduced for GAD support. The results of the TA will be disseminated among \nparticipating countries and within ADB through both country and regional workshops and a \nconference. \n \nIV.
