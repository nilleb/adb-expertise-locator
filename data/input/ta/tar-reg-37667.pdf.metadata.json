In recent years the issue of trafficking in people has received increasing attention \nbecause it has increased phenomenally across the globe. The Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) has traditionally been an area of high migration, within its countries and across borders. \nImproved connectivity in recent times has led to increased migration, and an unprecedented rise \nin the most unfortunate and exploitative form, i.e. human trafficking.1 Poor women and children \nsuffer  most  as  victims  of  trafficking.  The  Fourth  World  Conference  on  Women  in  Beijing \nidentified trafficking as one of the key areas for the Beijing Platform for Action. In response to \nthe growing awareness of trafficking as a complex development issue, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) as the lead donor in the GMS, has been asked by regional stakeholders to join the \nsubregional efforts against trafficking.  \n \n2.  This  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)2  was  endorsed  by  the  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation Fund during the Third Strategy Meeting of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy \nand Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund in July 2003. The TA will include four countries: \nCambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand, and Viet Nam. The TA \naims to (i) improve awareness in ADB regarding the causes, nature, and consequences of \ntrafficking in women and children; (ii) assist the developing member countries (DMCs) to reach \nsubregional agreements and prepare action plans to prevent trafficking; and (iii) develop pilot \nprograms in conjunction with selected GMS projects, that could prevent trafficking and could be \nreplicated. The scope, implementation arrangements, and cost estimates reflect the findings of \nthe fact-finding missions in November 2003 and February 2004. The missions met with various \nstakeholders, including international agencies, governments, and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs). The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n                                                           \n                                                   II.    ISSUES \n \n3.  The trafficking of migrants is increasing in the GMS. Despite enormous natural wealth in \nthe GMS countries, poverty remains high. Migration for employment is growing within the GMS \ncountries and to external destinations. Migration can be beneficial to both sending and receiving \ncountries. Migration can prove to be a strategy for moving out of poverty,3 getting out of \nsituations of exploitation, and accessing new opportunities. However, increasing migration of \nwomen and young people intensifies the risks of trafficking in illegal and exploitative work \nsituations.4  \n \n4.  Within  the  GMS,  factors  fuelling  trafficking  include  (i)  economic  issues,  (including \npoverty, lack of opportunities to earn, indebtedness, food shortages, loss of assets, natural \ndisasters, and conflicts; (ii) social issues (gender discrimination, low value attached to girls, \nsexual  abuse,  lack  of  awareness  among  communities  of  risks  of  trafficking,  ethnic \n                                                 \n1  \u201cThe UN defines trafficking as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons by means of \nthreat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a \nposition of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments and benefits to achieve the consent of a person \nhaving control over another person for the purposes of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the \nexploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or \npractices similar to slavery, servitude, or the removal of organs.\u201d UNIAP 2004. Bangkok.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 15 October 2003. \n3  Migration benefits the migrants and their families. Migration remittances have significant roles in asset creation for \npoor households, thereby improving their livelihood sustainability (refer to studies on migration, Breman, J., Arvind \nN. Das et al. Down and Out, Laboring under Global Capitalism, Oxford 2000, Kothari, Uma. Migration and Chronic \nPoverty. Institute for Development Policy, University of Manchester, Cohen, Skeldon, etc.). \n4 Accurate figures are not available on the extent of migration and trafficking in theGMS. Estimates vary widely. \nHowever, international agencies working on trafficking agree that a growing number of women, men, and children \nwho migrated out of poverty and deprivation, ended up in debt bondage, and forced to work in illegal and \nhazardous occupations.  ", "2   \ndiscrimination); and (iii) political problems (conflicts, wars, and their aftermath). On the demand \nside, factors that encourage trafficking include (i) demand for cheap labor, (ii) weak legal and \npolicy frameworks, (iii) lack of enforcement capacity, (iv) lack of intergovernmental cooperation, \nand (v) corruption.5 Globalization, accompanied by improved communications, media networks, \nand information technology accelerate trafficking.  \n \n5.  Typical sending areas are characterized by poverty, poor access to services, lack of \neconomic options, low levels of education and access to information, gender discrimination, \npresence of ethnic minority populations, social exclusion, and proneness to natural disasters. \nPoverty, lack of livelihood opportunities, and social disadvantage are among factors that can \nlead to migration. However, potential migrants who are ignorant of job markets; unaware of \nlaws, rules, and regulations covering migration; and lacking documentation, resources, and \ninformation, can fall prey to traffickers.6 Groups particularly at risk of being trafficked include \nwomen and children from poor areas; those without education and skills; migrants; victims of \ndisasters; victims of abuse and violence; those with no sources of support, including divorced, \nwidowed, or separated women; and those lacking community support. Lack of social support, \npowerlessness, and isolation characterize such groups.  \n \n6.  The  expansion  in  trafficking  has  been  accompanied  by  a  marked  increase  in \ninternational attention to the issue. After the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing \n(1995), an increasing number of local, national, and regional projects have been implemented to \nprevent trafficking and/or providing assistance to victims. All GMS countries have taken up a \nwide range of initiatives to address the complex issues related to trafficking. Viet Nam has made \npositive progress in punishing traffickers while Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Thailand have taken \nsteps  to  prevent  trafficking  and  assist  the  victims.  The  world\u2019s  first  memorandum  of \nunderstanding between two nations on trafficking was signed between Cambodia and Thailand. \nA number of such memorandums to promote intercountry cooperation on the trafficking issue \nare being discussed between Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Viet \nNam and the People\u2019s Republic of China are also attempting to strengthen bilateral cooperation \non the issue.   \n \n7.  At a regional level, a number of initiatives have been taken to promote intergovernment \ncooperation on matters related to trafficking.7 At the national level a number of initiatives have \nbeen taken by the GMS countries, including memorandums of agreement (MOUs), national \naction plans, national task forces, anti-trafficking legislation, establishment of anti-trafficking \nunits within law enforcement agencies, prevention programs, and assistance to victims. Yet \ndespite these initiatives, an increased awareness of the issue within the subregion, and some \nimpacts at local levels, no significant impact is being made on the trafficking issue for many  \nreasons. A definition of trafficking has not been agreed to, which has led to inconsistencies in \nresponse by national governments and international agencies. This has also contributed to the \nfailure  to  collect  comparable  data.  No  subregional  agreement  exists  for  intercountry \ncollaboration against trafficking. Other problems stem from the lack of coordination, weak laws, \ncorruption, knowledge gaps, and lack of options for migrants who may be potential victims of \ntrafficking. Interventions appear to be too thinly spread, donor-driven, and with not enough \ncoordination to cover all the key issues in a consistent manner.  \n \n                                                 \n5   Corruption is a major obstacle to effective prevention of trafficking and prosecution of traffickers. \n6  International Labour Organization-International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour. 2003.

", "3 \n8.  Issues that need to be addressed in the context of ADB operations in the GMS include \n(i)  the  need  to  enhance  ADB\u2019s  understanding  of  how  the  issue  relates  to  ADB\u2019s  core \ndevelopment  efforts  in  the  GMS,  identify  an  appropriate  role  given  its  mandate  and \ncompetencies, and develop pilot programs linked to its projects, which could prevent trafficking; \n(ii) the need to develop a GMS subregional agreement and action plan to combat trafficking \nthrough effective intergovernmental cooperation; (iii) support for a subregional resource center, \nto be set up in collaboration wih the United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking \nin the Greater Mekong Sub-region (UNIAP), which can improve coordination and act as clearing \nhouse for information on trafficking in the GMS, as well as support capacity building; and (iv) \nidentification of program at the national level that can help reduce the risks of trafficking, within \nthe larger framework of developing improved transportation, mobility, and the expansion of \ntourism.   \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s GMS program and the regional cooperation strategy and program (RCSP) aim to \nreduce  poverty  through  improving  connectivity,  reducing  inequality,  and  fostering  social \ndevelopment.  The  GMS  program  consists  of  eight  subsectors,  including  human  resource \ndevelopment, transport, trade, and tourism. ADB has supported initiatives against HIV/AIDS \nthrough its TA program and infrastructure projects.8 The cross-border movement of goods and \npeople is seen in both the GMS Program and the RCSP as a key to reducing poverty. During \nconsultations on the RCSP with civil society, demand from NGOs and civil society for ADB to \naddress the issue of human trafficking specifically was strong, in addition to addressing the \nissues of HIV/AIDS and drug control. The promotion of effective preventive programs against \nthe risks of trafficking and development of safe and legal migration have to go alongside \nimprovement in physical infrastructure and the development of subregional agreements to \nfacilitate cross border movements of goods and people. \n \n10.  In  the  context  of  ADB\u2019s  significant  role  in  promoting  subregional  cooperation  and \neconomic integration by supporting key infrastructure for transport, trade, and tourism, ADB \nmust  develop  a  better  understanding  of  issues  of  trafficking  and  the  gender  aspects  of \nmigration. ADB also needs to develop pilot programs that can be replicated in future ADB-\nassisted projects, to deal effectively with the risks of trafficking in its projects for infrastructure \ndevelopment and promotion of tourism. ADB needs to work with the governments to support \nsafe legal migration as a livelihood option for labor within the GMS. \n   \n11.  Combating trafficking in the GMS is relevant for ADB\u2019s operations. First, identification of \nareas with potential trafficking victims in relation to ADB\u2019s infrastructure and tourism projects \nand developing pilot programs for replication can help to reduce poverty and mitigate the risks \nof trafficking. Second, support for efforts to combat trafficking of women and girls are in line with \nADB\u2019s  commitment  on  gender  and  development.  Third,  support  for  subregional  efforts  to \ncombat trafficking is in keeping with ADB\u2019s lead role in the GMS for poverty reduction and pro- \npoor growth through its GMS program.  \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n     \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n12.  The goal of the TA is the improved safety and economic benefit of mobility of poor and \nvulnerable people in the GMS, especially women and children. The purpose is to encourage  \nsubregional  cooperation  in  the  GMS  countries  for  promoting  safe  migration  and  address \n                                                 \n8  TAs and projects include ADB. 1997.

The outputs will consist of the following  (i) pilot \nprograms to promote safe migration and minimize risks of trafficking, to be developed and \nimplemented  along  with  two  ADB-financed  DMC  loan  projects:  L1989  for  Northern  Area \nEconomic Corridor Project (Lao PDR), Loans 1969 (Cambodia), 1970 (Lao PDR), and 1971 \n(Viet  Nam)  on  GMS  Mekong  Tourism  Development  Project;  (ii)  support  to  subregional \ncooperation on against trafficking (in collaboration with UNIAP in which participating countries \nare Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam; (iii) country-level awareness raising through \nadvocacy and policy dialogue (Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam); and (iv) evaluation and \ndissemination to be carried out and a scaling-up strategy to be prepared. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will cover four countries of the GMS: namely Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and \nViet Nam.9 Component 1 will include three DMCs\u2014Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam\u2014and \nwill  include  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  pilot  programs  for  the  prevention  of \ntrafficking. These will be developed in the context of the ADB-supported projects, the Northern \nEconomic Corridor and the Mekong Tourism Development,10 and will consist of working with \ngovernments,  NGOs,  and  communities  to  (i)  establish  baselines  and develop monitoring \nmechanisms to assess the situation of poverty, migration, and trafficking among communities at \nrisk at pre-project, mid-project and post-project stages; (ii) prepare awareness campaigns, \nincluding  workshops  and  seminars  against  trafficking  for  communities  and  government \nagencies,  which  will  build  upon  work  related  to  HIV/AIDS  awareness  under  the  Northern \nEconomic Corridor Project; (iv) develop economic alternatives for groups at risk through training \nand economic empowerment of women and girls, and imparting knowledge of life skills to \nchildren; (v) developing a set of guidelines to integrate trafficking issues in GMS projects; and \n(vi) hold a subregional conference on trafficking at ADB headquarters.  \n \n14.  Component 2 will include the four DMCs and will address subregional issues and include \nactivities to be implemented in conjunction with the UNIAP. These will consist of (i) support to \nthe Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative Against Trafficking  (COMMIT) and the subregional \ninterministerial  consultations  and  agreement  for  a  comprehensive  regional  response  to \ntrafficking;  (ii)  support  to  develop  a  subregional  action  plan  to  implement  the  COMMIT \ndeclaration or resolution agreed upon by the ministers at the interministerial meeting, to be held \nin Myanmar; (iii) support to develop a subregional resource center; and (iv) setting up of a \nsubregional training program for governments, NGOs, and civil society in collaboration with the \nUNIAP.  \n \n15.  Component 3 will include advocacy and policy dialogue in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam, with ministries of economy and finance and other line ministries, to \u201cmainstream\u201d such \nissues into national policy making and resource allocation processes. Almost all anti-trafficking \nactivities  in  the  region  are  externally  funded.  To  increase  domestic  commitment  and \nsustainability  for  such  programs,  more  public  resources  must  be  allocated  for  prevention \nactivities, rehabilitation programs, and improved prosecution. Policy dialogue under the TA will \ninclude  ministries  of  finance  and  planning  and  will  be  aimed  at  strengthening  political \ncommitment for resources allocation to anti-trafficking programs. Component 4 will consist of \nproject  management  support,  for  purposes  of  evaluation  of  outcomes  and preparation of \ndissemination strategies.  \n                                                 \n9  Myanmar will be included only to the extent that the next Subregional Inter-Ministerial Consultation on Human \nTrafficking will  be held in October 2004 in Myanmar, where the regional declaration and action plan are expected \nto be approved and adopted. \n10 Pilot anti-trafficking programs will be developed in Rattanakiri and Stung Treng provinces in Cambodia, Luang \nNamtha province in the Lao PDR, and Tien Giang and An Gieng in Viet Nam. These are some of the areas to be \ncovered under the counterpart projects. ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000 equivalent, and will be financed by \nADB on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. Appendix 2 provides cost \nand financing details. \n \nIV.  IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, and is expected to commence in July 2004. \nIt will comprise the following stages: (i) inception and subregional activities in support of \nCOMMIT  process  (months  1\u201310);  (ii)  pilot  activities  (months  2\u201324);  (iii)  in-country  policy \ndialogue (months 21\u201323); (iv) project management support (months 1\u201324); and (v) subregional \nconference, final report, and dissemination (months 20\u201324).  \n \n18.   The TA requires the services of two international consultants for 8 person-months in \ntotal, and domestic consultants for 20 person-months. All consultants will be recruited as \nindividuals  by  ADB  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  and  its  Borrowers,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  \nengagement of domestic consultants, and using the simplified technical proposal and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. One international consultant (the team leader) will work \nunder the joint supervision of ADB and UNIAP, to assist the COMMIT process, to develop a \ndraft subregional action plan. He or she will also be team leader; coordinate all activities; \nsupervise subregional and national activities; and produce the inception, interim, and final \nreports. The other international consultant will have input to the preparation of benefit monitoring \nand  evaluation  (BME)  mechanisms.  The  TA  will  engage  the  services  of  one  or  more \ninternational/national NGOs to design and implement pilot programs in connection with the \nNorthern Economic Corridor and Mekong Tourism Development Projects, in the three DMCs. \nThe  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB\u2018s  Agriculture, \nEnvironment,  and  Natural  Resources  Division,  Mekong  Department  (MKAE)  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency for the TA. Each country will have a focal ministry11 to coordinate TA \nactivities. In each country, the consultants and NGOs will work in close coordination with the \nworking  groups  set  up  to  undertake  national  anti-trafficking  activities under the COMMIT \nprocess.12 The consultants will submit an inception report (end of month 2), interim report \n(month 9), and final report (months 17\u201318). All reports will incorporate comments by ADB and \nUNIAP staff. \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, for Preventing the Trafficking of \nWomen and Children and Promoting Safe Migration in the Greater Mekong Subregion, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n11 Counterpart agencies will include Ministry of Tourism in Cambodia, Ministry of Communications, Transport, Posts \nand Construction and National Tourism Authority in Lao PDR, and Ministry of Planning and Investment in Viet \nNam.  \n12  These are normally composed of ministries of finance, foreign affairs, home, labor, women, etc. ", "6         Appendix 1   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \nImproved safety and  Reduced reported cases  Subregional monitoring   \neconomic benefit of  and estimates in trafficked  mechanisms of trends in \nmobility of poor and  people  trafficking developed under \nvulnerable people in the    the regional plan and other  \nGreater Mekong  mechanisms \nSubregion (GMS),   \nespecially women and \nchildren \n \nPurpose  Within 6 months of    (Purpose to goal) \n  successful delivery of all     \n  outputs     \n       \nEncourage subregional  a.
