Bangladesh  Government\u2019s  Vision  2021  envisages  developing  an  integrated  and \ndeveloped energy sector with a diversified fuel mix which will be the key driver of a sustainable \nnational economy. It is projected that demand for electricity will increase to 20,000 megawatts \nin 2021. To meet the demand, the government committed to enhancing generation capacity \nthrough increasing gas production. Also, the government plans to diversify the use of primary \nfuels, such as gas and liquid fuel for power generation. To help the government achieve its \ngoals, a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is deemed necessary to prepare a \nholistic investment plan for the proposed multi-tranche financing facility (MFF) and conduct \nproper  due  diligence  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  co-financiers\u2019 \nconsiderations. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A4.1.  \n \nTable A4.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \n       \nConducting project technical,  July 2014           Inception Report  Jan 2014 \neconomic, financial,           Interim Report  Feb 2014  \ngovernance, resettlement,           Draft Final Report  Apr 2014 \nenvironmental and social due           Final Report  May 2014 \ndiligence \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.
