The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested assistance of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), during the 2000 country programming mission, to support the \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) in strengthening the financial sector. Amid rapid development of \nthe  PRC  financial  sector,  bringing  its  legal  and  regulatory  framework  up  to  international \nstandards is critical for better integration of the market with the global financial market. Laws \nand regulations need to be streamlined under a systematic banking oversight framework, those \nthat are clearly in conflict with the development of the financial sector should be reviewed, \nremoved and amended to be consistent with the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework, \nand  new  laws  and  regulations  need  to  be  drafted  to  tackle  challenging  issues  facing  the \nfinancial sector. Fact-finding missions visited the PRC in March 2001 and March 2002 to reach \nan understanding with PBC and the Government on the objectives, scope, cost, financing, and \nimplementation arrangements for the technical assistance (TA).1 The TA framework is provided \nin Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC\u2019s financial sector is now governed by the PBC Law, Commercial Banking Law, \nNegotiable  Instruments  Law,  Insurance  Law,  Securities  Law,  Trust  Law,  and  significant \nsubordinate  legislation  such  as  regulations,  decrees,  provisions,  and  opinions  issued  by \ndifferent agencies. Under the PBC Law, effective in March 1995, PBC is entrusted with the \nresponsibility to (i) formulate and implement monetary policy; (ii) exercise supervision and \nadministration of the financial industry; and (iii) examine and approve the establishment of PRC \nfinancial institutions, including those with foreign investment and branch offices of foreign banks. \nThe PBC Law also prohibits PBC from lending to government authorities. \n \n3.  The Commercial Banking Law, effective in July 1995, standardized the commercial \nbehavior of banks, which were mostly state-owned. Under the law, commercial banks need to \nbe established in accordance with legal requirements under the Company Law of 1994. Banks \nare required to be formed as limited liability companies and acquire the status of a legal person \nresponsible for their own liabilities and debts to the extent of their assets. The law also sets out \nthe  general  principles  for  lending,  personnel  management,  and  depositor  protection.  The \ncommercial banks established prior to the enactment of the Commercial Banking Law are \nprovided with lead time to reorganize their structures to comply with the Company Law. The \nNegotiable  Instruments  Law,  effective  in  January  1996,  applies  to  bills  of  exchanges, \npromissory notes, and checks, and specifies the liabilities arising under these instruments. \n \n4.  The Securities Law of July 1999 provides regulatory and supervisory authority to the \nChina Securities Regulatory Commission over the issuing and trading of securities, take over of \nlisted companies and over securities firms, securities exchanges, central depositories, clearing \ninstitutions, investment banks, and credit-rating agencies. The Insurance Law of October 1995 \nspecifies the requirements for setting up an insurance company for the formation of insurance \ncontracts. PBC was entrusted with the regulatory and supervisory responsibility of the insurance \nindustry when the law was enacted. However, in late 1998, responsibility for oversight of the \ninsurance sector was transferred to the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. Currently, \nregulations in various forms are still being drafted to expand and clarify the Insurance Law. The \nTrust Law effective on 1 October 2001 lays down the foundation for developing legal trusts in \nthe  PRC  and  defines  fiduciary  duties  and  imposes  rules  governing  boards  of  trustees.  In \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities on July 2001. ", "2 \naddition to the basic Trust Law, the Government sees the need to prepare detailed rules for \nspecific trusts, such as pension and investment funds.  \n \n5.  Supported  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  supervisory  project  in  1996,  PBC  drafted  a  set  of \nbanking regulations defining (i) the purpose and scope of regulatory activities, administrative \nauthority and procedures, and organization of the PBC; and (ii) organization, expansion, and \ncorporate activities of a commercial bank. Regulations have been introduced to define the \nscope of permitted bank business (deposit taking, borrowing, lending, investment, real estate, \ntrading  activities),  capital  requirements,  liquidity  and  interest  rate  risk  management \nrequirements,  payments  and  settlements  operations,  operational  requirements  and  internal \ncontrols, prudential reporting requirements, administrative remedies, examination authority of \nthe PBC, takeover of a commercial bank by the PBC, and resolution of troubled banks. PBC has \ndeveloped an outline of a banking manual that could be distributed to commercial banks that \nwould include all relevant PBC laws and regulations, updated on a regular basis. \n \n6.  The promulgation of these financial sector laws accelerated the reform and growth of \nboth the banking and nonbanking subsectors. Despite this progress, the PRC financial market is \nstill governed by a series of low-level and sometimes conflicting legislation. The current process \nof preparing laws and regulations is seen as ad hoc, lacking pro-active approaches that would \nstreamline  laws  and  regulations  under  a  systematic  banking  system  oversight  framework. \nInvestors not familiar with the legal and regulatory systems need to consult several sets of rules \nand regulations to conduct financial sector operations effectively. Finally, no consistent and \neffective  approach  is  used  to  enact  and  amend  laws  and  regulations,  and  transparent \nprocedures are not available to involve stakeholders in the legislation process.  \n \n7.  Since the late 1990s, the PRC has experienced the failure of trusts and investment \ncompanies.  To  strengthen  the  regulatory  framework  and  supervisory  system,  the  PRC \nintroduced strict segregation of banking, securities, and insurance businesses. As a result, a \nsegregated  regulatory  framework  identifies  the  PBC  as  the  banking  regulator,  the  China \nSecurities Regulatory Commission as the capital markets regulator, and the China Insurance \nRegulatory Commission as the insurance market regulator. Strict segregation can be effective in \nenforcing market discipline and prudence of financial institutions particularly in less-developed \nmarket environments such as the PRC. However it has introduced an inherent risk of regulatory \ngaps and forgoes opportunities of financial service consolidation that capitalizes on economy of \nscale, operational efficiency, and a broader customer base. Regulatory segregation has not \nstopped conglomeration of financial services in the PRC. A number of holding companies (e.g., \nChina  International  Trust  and  Investment  Company,  China  Everbright  Group,  and  China \nMerchant Group) are engaged in banking, insurance, and securities businesses; banks (e.g., \nBank  of  China)  in  securities;  and  insurance  companies  in  fund  management.  Prudential \nsupervision proves to be more difficult in a segregated system where financial institutions are \nengaged in cross-sector activities.2 The PBC has no mechanism to address solvency issues \nwithin  a  financial  conglomerate  such  as  double  or  multiple  gearing,  risks  incurred  by \nunregulated entities, and erection of firewalls between subsidiaries and between subsidiaries \nand parent companies. \n \n8.  The failure of trust and investment companies also exposes the weakness of bankruptcy \nlegislation in the PRC. Bankruptcy of financial institutions is governed by the 1986 Bankruptcy \nLaw for state-owned enterprises and the provisional regulations for financial institutions issued \n                                                 \n2  Some efforts have been made to set up an interagency committee among regulators to improve coordination. ", "    3 \nby PBC in 1994. The law does not provide any clear trigger for bankruptcy or rehabilitation or \nstipulation for creditor\u2019s rights and protection of depositors. \n \n9.  The need for anti-money laundering efforts has become a pressing issue for the PRC\u2019s \nfinancial sector following economic liberalization and opening up to the outside world. The 1997 \namendment of the Criminal Law criminalized money laundering for the first time. However, the \nrelevant clauses define \u201cupstream crimes\u201d rather narrowly and cover only three types of crimes, \nnamely money from narcotics crimes, organized crimes of the underworld, and smuggling. The \n2001 amendment of the Criminal Law added terrorism as another type of upstream crime. \nHowever, it still does not cover illegal incomes from corruption and other economic crimes, does \nnot provide corresponding financial regulations, and does not provide a mechanism to work with \nforeign regulatory authorities. PBC plans to work with domestic law enforcement agencies, \ncustoms, tax bureau, other financial market regulators, and foreign governments to strengthen \nthe legal and regulatory system against money laundering. \n \n10.  The Government recognizes the importance of a credit reporting system to facilitate \nfinancing of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and development of consumer banking \nservices. A well-designed and managed system can be used to track those that do not pay and \nthose that honor their obligations as well as keep records on employment and legal actions filed \nagainst enterprises and individuals. Credit reporting provides significant benefits to the financial \nsystem and the economy, including allowing SMEs and individual consumers with good credit to \nopen and expand credit lines; providing banks with reliable data for making sound judgments \nabout credit; reducing loan losses and bankruptcies through more accurate and cost-efficient \nassessment; and preventing fraud by tracking credit habits of enterprises and individuals so that \na sudden buildup of credit far beyond the repayment ability of the debtor can be recognized. A \nset of principles and standards should be developed and placed in regulations and policies to \ngovern the development of such a system. It is in the interest of government that all credit \ngrantors participate in the credit reporting system to improve the quality of credit being extended \nand to encourage increased SME lending through improved information to financial institutions. \nRegulation will be needed to provide access of credit providers to information, and at the same \ntime protect individuals and companies from misuse of the system by credit providers.  \n \n11.  The PRC has made far-reaching commitments in WTO negotiations to open up its \nfinancial sector. During the phase-out period of 5 years, the PRC will gradually remove the \ngeographic and legal restrictions for foreign financial institutions and liberalize the scope of \nbusinesses. The final commitments will open the sector to foreign access while maintaining \nsome limitation on cross-border supply and scope of business and foreign equity involvement. \nForeign  participation  in  the  PRC  financial  sector  has  been  governed  by  separate  sets  of \ntemporary regulations and provisions. However, the PRC\u2019s entry into WTO requires a complete \noverhaul  of  these  temporary  regulations  to  make  them  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  WTO \ncommitment regarding opening up the financial industry. PBC has to improve the legal and \nregulatory system to address existing weaknesses and be ready for future challenges. PBC will \nneed to identify legislation that is clearly in conflict with the development of the financial sector, \namend legislation that needs to be consistent with the PRC\u2019s WTO commitment, and draft \nlegislation to tackle new issues facing the financial sector.  \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s strategy in the financial sector is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to establish \na progressive policy and institutional framework, improve the legal and regulatory environment, \nfacilitate its complete integration into the global financial market, and enable the financial sector \nto play an important role in the PRC\u2019s transition to a market economy. The assistance for the \ndevelopment of the enabling legal and regulatory environment is an essential area for improving ", "4 \ninstitutional capability, transparency, and governance of the PRC financial sector. Since 1987, \nADB has supported capacity building for the banking system and strengthening of the legal and \nregulatory framework in the PRC.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n13.  The objectives of the TA are to assist PBC to strengthen the legal and regulatory \nframework for the banking system, in particular, to streamline laws and regulations under a \nsystematic banking oversight framework, identify legislation that is clearly in conflict with the \ndevelopment of the financial sector, and amend legislation that needs to be consistent with the \nPRC\u2019s WTO commitments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The scope of the TA includes \n \n(i)  developing a consistent approach for achieving a systematic and forward-looking \nbanking legislative and regulation framework by analyzing weaknesses of the \nexisting  PRC  banking  laws  and  regulations,  clarify  issues  that  need  to  be \naddressed, identify key driving factors, establish a direction for future legislative \nand regulatory work, and develop a legislative plan to be consistent with the \noverall framework; \n \n(ii)  assisting PBC to draft a set of laws and regulations including regulations on \ncredit information bureau, bankruptcy code for financial institutions, measures \ngoverning financial conglomerates, and laws against financial crimes such as \nmoney laundering; \n \n(iii)  examining inconsistencies of existing financial sector laws and regulations with \nthe PRC\u2019s WTO commitments, identify areas that need immediate action, and \nrecommend means for proper legal and regulatory treatments both for the phase-\nout period of 3 to 5 years and for the final commitment;  \n \n(iv)  evaluating the feasibility and advising the PBC on how to address the issues \nbrought  by  the  segregated  regulatory  system  and  how  to  properly  regulate \nfinancial conglomerates particularly from the prudential regulation point of view; \nand \n \n(v)  developing case studies to demonstrate and train PBC legal staff on how to \nidentify legal and regulatory issues, adopt consistent and effective approaches, \nensure stakeholders\u2019 participation, and be consistent with the overall legislative \nframework of the financial sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,000,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$800,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program, including the entire \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $635,000  and  local  currency  cost  of  $165,000  equivalent.  The ", "    5 \nGovernment will provide $200,000 equivalent through the provision of counterpart staff, office \nspace, and contingencies. Details of the cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  PBC will be the Executing Agency. The Legal Department of PBC will be responsible for \nTA implementation. A working group will be established, under the leadership of the director \ngeneral of the Legal Department, to work as counterparts to the respective consultants and \nensure successful TA implementation. The working group is also responsible for coordination of \nother concerned agencies on interrelated issues. PBC will provide the necessary office space, \ncounterpart  staff,  transportation,  and  other  services  to  the  consultants,  and  will  arrange \nappointments for the consultants with relevant agencies and organizations.  \n \n17.  The TA will engage a team of international consultants for a total of 14 person-months: \none banking regulatory expert and team leader who has practical experience with legal and \nregulatory  treatment  of  banking  issues;  one  WTO  expert  who  understands  the  legal  and \nregulatory implications of the PRC\u2019s WTO commitments; and a number of banking legal experts \nto assist PBC to draft various laws and regulations. A team of domestic consultants for a total of \n14 person-months will have the same set of expertise as the international consultants. The \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be selected and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. Country experience \nand knowledge will be taken into account in selecting the consultants. In view of the specific and \ndetailed nature of TA terms of reference, the simplified technical proposal format will be used. \n \n18.  The team leader will be responsible for the delivery of reports. The consultants will \nsubmit  (i)  an  inception  report  3  weeks  after  commencement  of  their  services,  (ii)  interim \nprogress reports at appropriate stages of TA implementation, (iii) a draft final report before the \nconclusion of the contract, and (iv) a final report 2 weeks after incorporating PBC\u2019s and ADB's \ncomments. The TA will commence in July 2002 and be completed in June 2003. Seminars and \nworkshops  will  be  organized  intermittently  during  implementation  to  invite  comments  from \ninternational and domestic experts in the field and disseminate the findings of the report.  \n \nIV.
