INTRODUCTION\n1. During the 1995 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the People's\nRepublic of China (PRO) requested technical assistance (TA) to review the present social security\nsystem, establish basic minimum standards for the continued provision of these social services,\nand make policy recommendations of how best to manage such provisions from a fiscal\nperspective. The Bank's strategic agenda for policy dialogue in the PRO includes the reform of\nenterprises to improve efficiency; reduce the drain on the Government's budget of subsidies to\nmoney-losing State-owned enterprises (SOE5); develop a social safety net; and separate\nhousing, health, and education from enterprises. The TA was included in the 1995 Country\nOperational Program for the PRO.\n2. A Bank Fact-finding Mission visited the PAC from 22 May to 2 June 1995 to hold\ndiscussions with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Personnel, People's\nInsurance Company of China, Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Civil\nAffairs, People's Bank of China, and other agencies on various aspects of the TA. The scope,\nimplementation arrangements, terms of reference for consultants and financing arrangements\nof the TA reflect the understanding reached with the Government.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Under the traditional employment system in the PRC, the State assigned workers\nto units and enterprises, which were obliged to provide jobs. The workers were guaranteed\nlifetime employment and were provided with housing, medical and retirement benefits, and a\nbasic salary that depended on the worker's number of years of service. Such a system was\nrigid, resulted in overstaffing in most work units and enterprises, restricted labor mobility, and\nresulted in little correspondence between the remuneration of workers and their productivity. To\nmake enterprises more financially accountable and to assess their performance by commercial\nstandards, it became necessary to change the old system of employment, social benefits, and\nhousing so that work units and enterprises would not be burdened with social responsibilities.\nIn the second half of the 1 980s, the authorities began experimenting with reforms in these areas.\nHowever, progress in establishing an alternate social safety net and rationalizing the social\nsecurity and welfare system has been relatively slow because of major social and fiscal\nimplications. Delay in social security reform has hindered the reform process in general, and\nenterprise and fiscal reform in particular.\n4. The PRO has been hesitant to address the problem of excess labor in SOEs\naggressively because of the social cost involved. Although reforms adopted in the 1 990s permit\nmore employer discretion in making employment decisions, few SOEs have actually laid off\nsignificant number of workers; work units continue to be overstaffed. This is partly due to the\nlack of support systems to help displaced workers retrain and find other employment. Because\nof the legacy of the centrally planned system, there is a feeling among SOE managers that\nenterprises are responsible for providing a broad range of social support for their employees.\nThere are concerns about adverse social consequences if the required social safety nets are not\nin place before reforms that displace workers are implemented.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 1995.", "2\n5. To enforce hard budget constraints on SOEs without adverse social\nconsequences, and to preserve social stability, an adequate social safety net must be developed.\nAn unemployment insurance scheme was established in 1986. In addition to cash relief, the\nunemployment scheme also provides training to the unemployed and assistance in setting up\nsmall businesses. At present the unemployment insurance covers more than 70 million SOE\nemployees. Traditionally, housing was an integral part of the employment system, being rented\nto workers at highly subsidized rates. Experiments with housing reform have been under way\nfor several years in Yantai, Bengbo, Shenzhen, and Shanghai. In 1991, the pace of housing\nreform was accelerated with the announcement by most municipalities of major increases in\nrents. According to a recent household expenditure survey, the level of rent is equivalent to only\n1 percent of the average household expenditure compared with 20-30 percent in most developed\ncountries. In the past, retirement benefits were provided by SOEs out of current revenue.\nRetirement funds were set up in the 1980s whereby workers and employers are required to\ncontribute a certain percentage of the payroll toward these funds. Such funds have been\nestablished at the municipal level in most cities and counties and at the provincial level in 12\nprovinces. The intention is to establish a unified national retirement scheme in the future.\n6. The Central Government has decided to unify the administration of social\ninsurance at the national level by establishing a ministry-level organization to oversee the PRC's\nsocial insurance system reform. The fiscal objective has been set to establish a multipillar\nfunded social insurance system that incorporates contributions from both the government and\nindividuals. The transition to a funded system will need more public expenditure to finance the\nestablishment of the administrative network, as well as the financing of the government's share.\nAlthough the financial obligation will be very large on the part of the different levels of\ngovernment, there has been no previous systematic study of the financial implications of these\nsocial benefits, nor of the most efficient way of delivering them.\n7. On 1 July 1994, the Social Security Department was established within MOF to\naddress the issue of establishing an adequate social safety net as part of the overall reform effort\nand to formulate creative and efficient ways of financing and managing the delivery of such\nsocial services. The TA is designed to assist the Social Security Department in achieving its\nobjectives, and to strengthen the capacity of MOF to efficiently finance the social services\npreviously provided by SOEs and work units.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The objectives of the TA are to assist the Government in implementing its social\nsecurity reform program and to find ways to match the expenditure responsibilities for the\ndelivery of social services with appropriate tax and nontax revenue reforms. Because the\nestablishment of an adequate social safety net is integral to SOE sector reform, progress in this\narea will help remove a major constraint in the reform program and enhance progress in the\nreform of the fiscal sector by reducing or eliminating directed lending by the policy banks to\nfinance SOE losses incurred through the provision of social services. The TA will examine social\nservices provided by work units and government agencies, evaluate which of these services\nshould be undertaken by the private sector and which should be retained, and determine how", "3\nthey will be funded. The TA will assess the fiscal policies that should be adopted to fund an\nadequate level of social services. In addition, the TA will evaluate policy options for a regulatory\nframework for social insurance system reform.\nB.\t Scope\n9. The TA will assist the Government in identifying the responsibilities that it will retain\nor assume with the reform of the social security system, estimate the expenditures that will be\nincurred for each category of social services to be provided, and identify tax and nontax revenue\nsources, including worker's contributions, for meeting those expenditure responsibilities. The\nTA will assist the Government in (I) categorizing the social security obligations of SOEs; (ii)\ncategorizing the social security obligations of the other work units and Government agencies;\n(iii) determining, from an efficiency standpoint, whether each category of social service should\nbe provided by a central agency or on a market-determined basis by competitive firms in the\nnon-State sector; (iv) proposing institutional and regulatory bodies best suited for the delivery\nand supervision of each category of social services to be provided; (v) proposing the terms of\nreference for the institutions and regulatory bodies charged with the responsibility for delivering\nsocial insurance in a rational, efficient, and nonduplicative manner; (vi) identifying the\nexpenditure responsibilities of the Central Government for the social insurance to be provided\nby central agencies; (vii) identifying the financial resources available or needed to meet these\nexpenditure responsibilities; (viii) evaluating the feasibility of a social security tax; (ix) designing\na social security budget incorporating transfer payments needed to finance social services; (x)\nproviding guidelines and establishing criteria for efficiently managing social security funds; and\n(xi) conducting local and international case studies and overseas training programs for reforming\nthe social security system and making it more efficient.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $610,000 equivalent, of which $470,000\nwill be in foreign exchange and $140,000 equivalent will be in local currency. The Bank will\nprovide $540,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange costs related to the services\nof international consultants, their per diem and international travel costs, overseas case studies\nand internships, part of the cost for an international conference, and the purchase of equipment;\nand $70,000 equivalent in local currency costs for local consultants, equipment, seminars, and\nmiscellaneous administrative costs. The Government will provide a portion of the local currency\ncost amounting to $70,000 equivalent. The Government-financed portion will cover the\nremaining local costs including domestic case studies, part of the cost of the workshop and\ninternational conference, counterpart staff, administrative and secretarial services, office\naccommodation, and purchase of documents. Detailed cost estimates and financing\narrangements are shown in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. MOF will be the Executing Agency of the TA. It will establish a Task Force to\nguide the work of the consultants and to help solve problems during the course of the study.\nThe Task Force will hold monthly meetings to monitor TA implementation. The Social Security\nDepartment of MOF will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the TA and\ncoordination with the other Government agencies, under the guidance of the Task Force. The\ntn emm'1'\t rrw\t ai lu ii\t p1 uu..tuvuty.", "4\nTA will be implemented over a period of 12 months and is scheduled to be completed by\nNovember 1996.\n12. A team of international and domestic consultants will be engaged to assist the\nGovernment in carrying out the study. A firm of international consultants will be selected by the\nBank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The international\nconsultants will comprise three experts in the following areas: (i) social security systems, (ii) tax\nand fiscal policy, and (iii) budget systems. One of the international consultants will be\ndesignated as the team leader and will oversee the implementation of the TA and coordinate the\nwriting of the reports. Each international consultant will provide 3.5 months of services, of which\nat least 2.5 months will be spent in the field. The international consultants will recruit domestic\nconsultants, possibly from a list provided by MOF, to assist with the TA. A total of about 15\nperson-months of domestic consultant services will be required. Terms of reference for the\nconsultants are given in Appendix 2.\n13. Prior to the beginning of the fieldwork, the international consultants will hold a two-\nday workshop in Beijing or another selected city in the PRC to outline the experiences of other\ncountries in social security reform, especially those of transitional economies, and to draw\nlessons that may be applicable to the PRC. The participants in the workshop will include officials\nfrom MOF, other Central Government ministries and agencies dealing with social security affairs,\nand selected provincial and local government officials responsible for social security affairs.\n14. The fieldwork will include both domestic and foreign case studies. In addition, an\noverseas training program in social security affairs will also be conducted. The TA envisages\nprovision of three internships, each for a period of not less than six months, in the area of social\nsecurity policy and administration at selected universities or government agencies in countries\nto be selected mutually by MOF and the Bank. Prior to the international case studies, MOF will\nsubmit to the Bank for approval a proposal including countries/local areas to be visited and\nreasons for their selection, major issues to be addressed, and proposed composition of the\nteam. In line with the Bank's strategic theme of encouraging women to participate more actively\nin the development process, the composition of the overseas study missions as well as the\noverseas training program will show due consideration for gender balance. Prior to the\ncommencement of the overseas training, MOF will submit to the Bank for its review and approval\nthe training plan, which should include, among others, the subjects of the training, the host\ninstitutions or agencies, duration of the training, cost estimates, trainee selection criteria, and\nselected candidates for training. To facilitate the overseas training, an advance payment facility\nwill be provided under the TA.\n15. At the conclusion of the fieldwork, the consultants will jointly write a report under\nthe supervision of the team leader to communicate their findings and recommendations to the\nGovernment. The findings and recommendations of the consultants and the results of the\noverseas case studies will be presented to MOF, other Central Government ministries and\nagencies, selected provincial and local government agencies responsible for social security\naffairs, and other invited international organizations at an international conference to be arranged\nby MOF at the end of the TA implementation period.", "5\nIV.

The TA is designed to assist the Social Security Department in achieving its\nobjectives, and to strengthen the capacity of MOF to efficiently finance the social services\npreviously provided by SOEs and work units.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The objectives of the TA are to assist the Government in implementing its social\nsecurity reform program and to find ways to match the expenditure responsibilities for the\ndelivery of social services with appropriate tax and nontax revenue reforms. Because the\nestablishment of an adequate social safety net is integral to SOE sector reform, progress in this\narea will help remove a major constraint in the reform program and enhance progress in the\nreform of the fiscal sector by reducing or eliminating directed lending by the policy banks to\nfinance SOE losses incurred through the provision of social services. The TA will examine social\nservices provided by work units and government agencies, evaluate which of these services\nshould be undertaken by the private sector and which should be retained, and determine how", "3\nthey will be funded. The TA will assess the fiscal policies that should be adopted to fund an\nadequate level of social services. In addition, the TA will evaluate policy options for a regulatory\nframework for social insurance system reform.\nB.\t Scope\n9. The TA will assist the Government in identifying the responsibilities that it will retain\nor assume with the reform of the social security system, estimate the expenditures that will be\nincurred for each category of social services to be provided, and identify tax and nontax revenue\nsources, including worker's contributions, for meeting those expenditure responsibilities. The\nTA will assist the Government in (I) categorizing the social security obligations of SOEs; (ii)\ncategorizing the social security obligations of the other work units and Government agencies;\n(iii) determining, from an efficiency standpoint, whether each category of social service should\nbe provided by a central agency or on a market-determined basis by competitive firms in the\nnon-State sector; (iv) proposing institutional and regulatory bodies best suited for the delivery\nand supervision of each category of social services to be provided; (v) proposing the terms of\nreference for the institutions and regulatory bodies charged with the responsibility for delivering\nsocial insurance in a rational, efficient, and nonduplicative manner; (vi) identifying the\nexpenditure responsibilities of the Central Government for the social insurance to be provided\nby central agencies; (vii) identifying the financial resources available or needed to meet these\nexpenditure responsibilities; (viii) evaluating the feasibility of a social security tax; (ix) designing\na social security budget incorporating transfer payments needed to finance social services; (x)\nproviding guidelines and establishing criteria for efficiently managing social security funds; and\n(xi) conducting local and international case studies and overseas training programs for reforming\nthe social security system and making it more efficient.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $610,000 equivalent, of which $470,000\nwill be in foreign exchange and $140,000 equivalent will be in local currency. The Bank will\nprovide $540,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange costs related to the services\nof international consultants, their per diem and international travel costs, overseas case studies\nand internships, part of the cost for an international conference, and the purchase of equipment;\nand $70,000 equivalent in local currency costs for local consultants, equipment, seminars, and\nmiscellaneous administrative costs. The Government will provide a portion of the local currency\ncost amounting to $70,000 equivalent. The Government-financed portion will cover the\nremaining local costs including domestic case studies, part of the cost of the workshop and\ninternational conference, counterpart staff, administrative and secretarial services, office\naccommodation, and purchase of documents. Detailed cost estimates and financing\narrangements are shown in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. MOF will be the Executing Agency of the TA. It will establish a Task Force to\nguide the work of the consultants and to help solve problems during the course of the study.\nThe Task Force will hold monthly meetings to monitor TA implementation. The Social Security\nDepartment of MOF will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the TA and\ncoordination with the other Government agencies, under the guidance of the Task Force. The\ntn emm'1'\t rrw\t ai lu ii\t p1 uu..tuvuty.", "4\nTA will be implemented over a period of 12 months and is scheduled to be completed by\nNovember 1996.\n12. A team of international and domestic consultants will be engaged to assist the\nGovernment in carrying out the study. A firm of international consultants will be selected by the\nBank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The international\nconsultants will comprise three experts in the following areas: (i) social security systems, (ii) tax\nand fiscal policy, and (iii) budget systems. One of the international consultants will be\ndesignated as the team leader and will oversee the implementation of the TA and coordinate the\nwriting of the reports. Each international consultant will provide 3.5 months of services, of which\nat least 2.5 months will be spent in the field. The international consultants will recruit domestic\nconsultants, possibly from a list provided by MOF, to assist with the TA. A total of about 15\nperson-months of domestic consultant services will be required. Terms of reference for the\nconsultants are given in Appendix 2.\n13. Prior to the beginning of the fieldwork, the international consultants will hold a two-\nday workshop in Beijing or another selected city in the PRC to outline the experiences of other\ncountries in social security reform, especially those of transitional economies, and to draw\nlessons that may be applicable to the PRC. The participants in the workshop will include officials\nfrom MOF, other Central Government ministries and agencies dealing with social security affairs,\nand selected provincial and local government officials responsible for social security affairs.\n14. The fieldwork will include both domestic and foreign case studies. In addition, an\noverseas training program in social security affairs will also be conducted. The TA envisages\nprovision of three internships, each for a period of not less than six months, in the area of social\nsecurity policy and administration at selected universities or government agencies in countries\nto be selected mutually by MOF and the Bank. Prior to the international case studies, MOF will\nsubmit to the Bank for approval a proposal including countries/local areas to be visited and\nreasons for their selection, major issues to be addressed, and proposed composition of the\nteam. In line with the Bank's strategic theme of encouraging women to participate more actively\nin the development process, the composition of the overseas study missions as well as the\noverseas training program will show due consideration for gender balance. Prior to the\ncommencement of the overseas training, MOF will submit to the Bank for its review and approval\nthe training plan, which should include, among others, the subjects of the training, the host\ninstitutions or agencies, duration of the training, cost estimates, trainee selection criteria, and\nselected candidates for training. To facilitate the overseas training, an advance payment facility\nwill be provided under the TA.\n15. At the conclusion of the fieldwork, the consultants will jointly write a report under\nthe supervision of the team leader to communicate their findings and recommendations to the\nGovernment. The findings and recommendations of the consultants and the results of the\noverseas case studies will be presented to MOF, other Central Government ministries and\nagencies, selected provincial and local government agencies responsible for social security\naffairs, and other invited international organizations at an international conference to be arranged\nby MOF at the end of the TA implementation period.", "5\nIV.
