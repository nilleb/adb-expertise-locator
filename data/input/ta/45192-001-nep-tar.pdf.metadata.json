INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is one of the major development partners in the \neducation sector in Nepal. ADB has been actively involved in supporting the Government of \nNepal in the ongoing School Sector Reform Program and Skills for Employment Project.1 The \ncapacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  Higher  Engineering \nEducation is an outcome of a series of discussions with the government since April 2011.2 The \nTA responds to the government\u2019s high priority in improving engineering and technical education \nin higher education, and increasing access to high quality engineering and technical education \nin far and mid-western regions that were severely affected by civil strife. The government \nconcurred with the design and monitoring framework, implementation arrangements, costs, \nfinancing plan, and terms of reference in October 2011. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Progress in development. Nepal is among the least developed countries in the world\u2014\nits human development index was ranked 157 out of 187 countries in 20113 and 31% of its \npopulation was living below the national poverty line in 2004.4 Its landlocked geographic location, \nprotracted sociopolitical transition, and susceptibility to natural disaster are the main challenges \nfor the country\u2019s growth. Nonetheless, Nepal has made progress in reducing its poverty, and \nimproving access to basic education, health, and clean water. The recent political transition from \na monarchy to a republic after a decade-long violent insurgence has triggered aspirations for \nsocial  changes.  Responding  to  this,  the  government\u2019s  strategy  envisages  tangible \nimprovements in the living standards of the poor, disadvantaged, and socially excluded sections \nof the population. \n \n3.  Potential  for  growth  and  human  resource  development  needs.  Nepal  has  four \ndistinct  advantages  for  economic  growth:  (i)  its  strategic  location  between  India  and  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, whose continued high growth can trigger untapped robust growth in \nNepal;  (ii)  natural  resources,  including  hydropower  and  biodiversity,  which  have  enormous \npotential given the huge needs for power and energy in South Asia; (iii) tourism, a major \neconomic force that can fuel investments; and (iv) a young population that supplies about \n450,000 new entrants to the labor market annually. The contribution from overseas Nepalese \nworkers to the economy is substantial, with remittances over 20% of the gross domestic product.  \n \n4.  Turning  the  human  resource  potential  into  socially  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable  economic  development  will  require  a  strong  human  resource  base.  There  is \nmassive need to develop the skills, capacity, and entrepreneurship of the young population to \navoid social tension from increasing youth unemployment. This will require transforming the \neducation system to focus on quality, relevance, and employability so that the labor market can \nmove up the value chain from the current heavy reliance on low level skills. The role of higher \neducation is crucial since the country must develop human resources that can lead the nation\u2019s \neconomic development and social transformation\u2014by addressing the challenges from massive \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2011.

Nepal  also  needs  to  improve  the \ncompetitiveness of Nepalese workers in the region and globally.  \n \n5.  Challenges in higher education. Nepal has made significant progress in primary and \nsecondary  education.  The  number  of  students  completing  and/or  passing  the  secondary \neducation exam is rising fast\u2014increasing by more than 100% from 113,020 in 2005 to 259,916 \nin  2009.  Higher  education  has  also  expanded  rapidly,  particularly  through  private  sector \nproviders in response to the unmet demand. Total enrollment increased 20 times from a very \nlow base of 17,000 students in 1970 to 351,900 students enrolled in 2009. There are six \nuniversities  and  three  higher  education  academies  (medical  schools),  with  89  constituent \ncampuses and 749 affiliated campuses. Among the total 749 affiliated campuses, 218 are \ncommunity campuses registered under the University Grant Commission that receive grants \nsupport.  The  remaining  531  campuses  are  private.  However,  access  to  higher  education \nremains low. Only 10% of the corresponding age cohort is enrolled in higher education, in \ncomparison to the world average of 26%.  \n \n6.  Disparities in access to higher education are large across different sex, income levels, \nand geographic locations. Female enrollment is only 30% of the total enrollment and is often \nbiased toward certain fields (e.g., education and nursing). Female enrollment in engineering \nremains  low,  at  15%.  The  enrollment  from  the  poorest  quintile,  mostly  consisting  of \ndisadvantaged social groups, is negligible. The urban\u2013rural disparity is significant, with the \nhighest concentration of institutions and students in Kathmandu Valley, while the mid- and far-\nwest development regions significantly lag in terms of the number of institutions and student \nenrollment. \n \n7.  The  relevance  and  quality  of  higher  education  is  an  increasing  problem.  Current \ninstitutional  and  student  expansions  are  not  based  on  job  market  perspective  or  national \ndevelopment needs. Students enrolled in education, management, and the humanities and \nsocial sciences comprised 85% of all students in higher education in FY2008 while science, \ntechnology, and engineering represented less than 10% of students. Concern is growing over \nthe high level of dropouts and unemployed graduates from humanities and social science \nprograms. The quality of higher education is generally poor, with an average passing rate of \n38% at bachelor\u2019s level and 40% at master\u2019s level. This is attributed to the lack of quality \nassurance mechanisms, a poor learning and teaching environment, the low level of faculty \ndevelopment  and  retention,  weak  administrative  capacity,  and  lack  of  linkages  between \neducation and the world of work.  \n \n8.  At the core of the issues are weak governance and lack of financing for higher education \ninstitutions. Higher education received 9.9% of the total education budget in FY2010. The lack \nof a clear national framework to guide and regulate higher education institutions has led to less \neffective  institutional  management,  low  output  efficiency,  and  lack  of  monitoring  and \naccountability. In particular, university system expansion through affiliation is becoming an issue \nbecause of the lack of effective quality control and the constraints to innovation at campus level. \n \n9.  Ongoing  higher  education  reform. While there  is  no  explicit  policy framework  or \nstrategy for higher education, the government has implemented two higher education reform \nprojects with the support of the World Bank, focusing on incremental reforms through the \nUniversity Grant Commission and directly with universities and colleges. The ongoing Second \nHigher Education Project, 2007\u20132014 aims at (i) enhanced quality, efficiency, and relevance of \nhigher education through a set of systemic reforms, and incentives to selected institutions; and \n ", "  3 \n(ii) improved access for academically qualified students from disadvantaged groups in higher \neducation and higher secondary education. \n \n10.  Focus on engineering and technical education. There is a large unmet demand for \nengineering and technical education at higher education level. Despite the recent expansion in \nhigher education enrollment, the development has been lopsided toward humanities and social \nscience. Engineering graduates are in short supply to meet market demand\u2014mainly because of \nthe  limited  number  of  graduates  and  emigration  of  graduates  for  better  job  opportunities \noverseas. Concern is also growing over the quality of graduates in terms of relevance to \nnational development priorities, mainly because of the lack of research facilities, practical and \nproblem-oriented research, and linkage to the world of work. Therefore, enhancing engineering \nand technical education is an urgent need. Quality engineering and technical education at \nhigher education is crucial to supply a qualified workforce to support growing public and private \ninvestments  in  transportation,  energy,  municipal  infrastructure,  tourism,  and  other  priority \nsectors. It will also lead innovations through industry linkage via collaboration in research and \ndevelopment, thus contributing to the economy\u2019s productivity and efficiency. Close linkages \nbetween  industry  and  universities  can  create  opportunities  for  cost-sharing  and  innovative \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) arrangements.  \n  \n11.  Linkage to country partnership strategy. The TA is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy  for  2010\u201320125 and  the  government\u2019s  priorities6 given  the  strategic \nimportance  of  education  in  reducing  poverty  and  social  exclusion,  enhancing  economic \nopportunities, and contributing to economic growth. ADB has supported the government in \nstrengthening  school  education  by  improving  quality  and  reducing  disparity  as  well  as  in \ndeveloping skills to increase employability. ADB also plans to develop a follow-up project in \ntechnical and vocational education and training. The TA complements ADB\u2019s ongoing and \nplanned investments, especially by aiming at higher education and exploring ways to strengthen \nthe backward linkage to secondary school education and skills development.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n12.  The TA will support the Ministry of Education and other stakeholders in identifying a \nstrategy to enhance higher engineering education in Nepal. The TA will work with the Institute of \nEngineering (IOE) as a model case in improving the quality and relevance of higher education in \nresponse to market demand and national development priorities through improved governance, \nmanagement capacity, and industry linkages.7 The TA will assist the stakeholders in identifying \nkey engineering disciplines to be strengthened, considering labor market demand as well as \nnational development priorities. It will also support IOE in refining its midterm strategic plan (i) to \nincrease access to engineering and technical education by establishing regional campuses in \nthe far-western and mid-western development regions, which are home to excluded groups8 and \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila.  \n6  The government\u2019s Three-Year Interim Plan, 2008\u20132010 and the draft National Development Strategy prioritize \nemployment-oriented and market-led broad-based economic growth, inclusive social development and targeted \nprograms, and sustainable peace building.  \n7  IOE has been selected as the model institute because it (i) is the premier engineering education institution in \nNepal, with four constituent campuses and 17 affiliated colleges (10 of them are private); (ii) produces teachers for \nits own colleges as well as other universities and colleges; (iii) has autonomy under the Tribhuvan University \nsystem, so it may introduce new rules and arrangements to a certain extent; and (iv) has demonstrated good \ncapacity in carrying out initiatives supported by development partners and private sector partners. \n8  The TA follows the definition of excluded groups of the Interim Constitution and the Three-Year Interim Plan. \nExcluded groups refer to those who have experienced exclusion historically and have not been mainstreamed in \n ", "4   \nconflict-affected regions; and (ii) introduce measures to enhance the relevance and quality of \nhigher  engineering  education,  including  continuous  professional  development,  an  improved \nresearch  environment,  better  utilization  of  information  and  communication  technology,  and \nuniversity\u2013industry linkages. Feasible PPP arrangements will be actively explored as ways to \nimprove the relevance and quality as well as financing options for higher engineering education. \nThe TA will support IOE to identify areas for improvement in governance, and prepare feasibility \nstudies. The TA will also support necessary due diligence for the future investment. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be improved quality of higher engineering education to meet \nthe emerging labor market needs. The outcome of the TA will be that the engineering and \ntechnical education system is designed toward greater market responsiveness. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The activities of the TA will be carried out through a consultative process involving key \nstakeholders to ensure that the recommendations are developed based on consensus. The TA \nwill conduct surveys, workshops, and focus group discussions to incorporate views from six \ntypes  of  stakeholders:  (i)  students,  (ii)  parents,  (iii)  teachers,  (iv)  policy  makers  (both \ngovernment and education institutions), (v) the private sector, and (vi) development partners. \nInputs from stakeholders will be analyzed and consolidated into the following five outputs:  \n \n15.  Output 1 will formulate an implementation plan for improved access to and quality of the \nengineering  program.  Under  this  output,  the  TA  will  examine  various  aspects  of  higher \nengineering education. In particular, it will explore options and develop detailed implementation \nplans to expand access and improve quality of higher education and its relevance to labor \nmarket demand and national development priorities. This output will produce two sub-outputs. \nFirst, a labor market analysis, focusing on engineering disciplines, to project the number of \ngraduates the labor market will require in specific disciplines and to identify priority disciplines \nfor strengthening or establishment. The labor market trend and practices in employment of \nwomen and people from excluded groups will also be assessed. Second, a program for the \nprofessional development of engineering faculty and an inclusive enrollment strategy for women \nand students from excluded groups will be developed.  \n \n16.  Output 2 will prepare a financing program for the expansion and improvement of the \nengineering education. This output will support feasibility studies for campus expansion, the \nestablishment of an information and communication technology (ICT) facility, improvement of \nthe research environment, and diversified financing options. The feasibility studies and financing \nplan will be submitted to the government and other potential funding sources for consideration.   \n \n17.  Output  3  will  improve  the  capacity  of  the  Institute  of  Engineering  and  participating \ninstitutions  in  human  resource  and  financial  management,  and  administration  of  academic \ninstitutions. Under this output, existing IOE policy, regulation, and management capacity and \npractices  will  be  reviewed  and  areas  for  improvement  will  be  identified.  Regional  and \ninternational  best  practices  will  be  discussed  and  adopted  as  appropriate.  The  output  will \nrecommend  policy  and  regulatory  changes,  which  will  be  consulted  with  stakeholders \n                                                                                                                                                       \nthe nation\u2019s development, i.e., women, Dalits, Adivasi Janajatis, Madhesis, Muslims, people living with disabilities, \nand people of geographically remote areas.  \n ", "  5 \n(government, Tribhuvan University, IOE, the private sector, and other engineering colleges) \nbefore being finalized in a governance improvement plan.  \n \n18.  Output 4 will complete a study of various academe\u2013industry\u2013private sector partnership \narrangements. This output will explore feasible options for higher engineering education to \nstrengthen industry linkage and collaboration with the private sector. Proposals may include \nresearch and development facility sharing, effective operation of a technology transfer center, \nindustry-specific  training  programs,  and  other  private  sector  partnerships.  Cost-sharing \narrangements will be actively explored. Selection of best practices will be based on interest from \nprivate sector partners.  \n  \n19.  Output  5  will  support  the  stakeholders  in  effective  planning,  management,  and \ncoordination  for  the  ensuing  project.  This  output  will  assist  IOE  to  develop  adequate \nimplementation arrangements for effective planning, management, and coordination of the TA \nas well as ensuing project activities. This output will also support other due diligence activities \nfor a follow-on investment project in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent. The government has requested \nADB to finance $550,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government and IOE will provide \nin-kind contributions such as office accommodation, staff time, and other coordination support. \nCost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  will  be  the  executing  agency.  IOE  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. IOE will also act as an anchor and will closely involve other higher \neducation institutions. A TA steering committee chaired by the secretary of the MOE will be \nestablished, with the dean of IOE as the member-secretary. Representatives from the University \nGrants  Commission,  Ministry  of  Finance,  National  Planning  Commission,  Federation  of \nNepalese  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industries,  Confederation  of  Nepalese  Industries, \nEngineering Association, and Banking Association will serve as members. Other members may \nbe co-opted as needed. The steering committee will be responsible for providing overall policy \ndirection, facilitating coordination among concerned government agencies, and seeking support \nfrom concerned public and private agencies.  \n \n22.  The  TA  will  engage  consultants  to  provide  a  total  of  32  person-months  of  inputs \n(12 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national consultants). ADB will \nengage the consultants through a firm, using a simplified proposal for the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method as well as on an individual basis, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The consultant requirements \nand terms of reference are outlined in Appendix 3. All TA-financed goods will be procured in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over 9 months \nwith expected commencement in March 2012 and completion in December 2012.  \n \n ", "6   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.
