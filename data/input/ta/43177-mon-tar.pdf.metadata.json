INTRODUCTION \n1.  During consultations for the country partnership strategy 2009\u20132013, held in August \n2008, the Government of Mongolia asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical \nassistance (TA) to develop a policy and mechanism to reduce air pollution in Ulaanbaatar. \nADB conducted a fact-finding mission in July 2009 and reached an understanding with the \nMinistry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MMRE) and Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB) \non the TA\u2019s objective, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, \nand consultants' terms of reference.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Air pollution is becoming a serious problem in Ulaanbaatar. Measured in terms of \nparticulate  matter  (PM),  it  is  estimated  as  several  times  above  maximum  acceptable \nstandards. From 17 to 22 November 2008 the maximum daily concentration of PM with \ndiameter less than 10 microns (PM ) was 600 microgram per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) and \n10\nmaximum hourly concentrations exceeded 2,500 \u00b5g/m3; maximum daily concentration of PM \nwith  diameter  less  than  2.5  microns  (PM )  was  350  \u00b5g/m3  with  maximum  hourly \n2.5\nconcentrations exceeding 1,300 \u00b5g/m3. The Mongolian country standard is an average daily \nconcentration of 50 \u00b5g/m3 for PM  and 100 \u00b5g/m3 for PM . Initial estimates suggest that \n2.5 10\ntotal health costs range from 1% to 4% of Mongolia\u2019s total gross domestic product.  \n \n3.  Preliminary  results  of  a  World  Bank  air  pollution  monitoring  and  health  impact \nbaseline study indicate that heating (and cooking) stoves used by mostly poor peri-urban \nhouseholds contribute an average of 45%\u201370% of the PM  concentrations. The impact of \n2.5\nstove emissions from ger areas depends on location and season. Their contribution is \nhighest during the winter, when coal is burned continuously, reaching 70% and more in ger \nareas and up to 60% in the city center. Other sources of pollution include dust, coal-fired \nheat-only boilers (HOB),2 coal-fired combined heat and power plant emissions, and ash \nstorage. All coal combustion emits sulfur dioxide, but poor combustion results in higher \nhydrogen sulfide, which poses a more serious health risk than sulfur dioxide. \n \n4.  The government has demonstrated its commitment to the reduction of air pollution \nthrough  the  formation  of  the  National  Committee  on  Coordination,  Management,  and \nOversight of Activities of Government Agencies for implementation of the government policy \non air pollution reduction (NCC) under MMRE. The government established the NCC in late \n2008  to  overcome  slow  progress  in  addressing  air  pollution  problems  in  Mongolia, \nparticularly  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The  NCC  is  mandated  to  address  air  pollution  issues  in \nUlaanbaatar in close collaboration with MUB, develop a policy for air pollution reduction, and \ncoordinate investments. The NCC includes stakeholders from a range of public and civil \norganizations.  It  is  overseeing  the  development  of  a  mechanism  to  achieve  sustained \nreductions in emissions, especially during the winter when they are severe due to use of \nrudimentary lignite-fired household stoves by about 40% of Ulaanbaatar\u2019s population. \n \n5.  The TA is part of a multi-development partner effort involving the World Bank (which \nis  planning  a  $12  million  International  Development  Association  credit  for  air  pollution \nreduction  in  Ulaanbaatar),  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development \n(implementing a \u20ac350,000 TA, which started in March 2009, on fuel switching policy options \nincluding testing of fuel-stove combinations), Japan International Cooperation Agency (has \ninitiated an emissions inventory for boilers), Government of Japan (through the World Bank \nis providing a $475,000 grant for capacity building and development of carbon financing \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 2 September 2009. \n2  A survey of 89 HOBs in Ulaanbaatar, found public boilers are inefficient (at 40%\u201350% efficiency), compared \nwith private boilers (at 60%\u201380% efficiency). \n ", "2   \nprojects through the Ministry of Nature, Environment and Tourism), France (has concluded a \n\u20ac2  million  loan  for  air  pollution  monitoring  stations  through  the  Ministry  of  Nature, \nEnvironment and Tourism), German development cooperation through GTZ (has installed air \npollution monitoring stations), World Bank, and Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).  \n \n6.  The TA will prepare a large-scale program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \nair pollution in Ulaanbaatar. MCC is developing an investment project to support renewable \nenergy development and air pollution abatement, which would scale up stove replacement \nactivities piloted under the TA to cover all of Ulaanbaatar. Implementation would begin in the \nlatter half of 2010. The World Bank plans to support an investment project in 2011 that will \nscale  up  stove  replacement  activities  if  the  MCC  project  does  not  materialize.3  Close \nattention will be paid to coordination of TA activities with MCC, World Bank, and other \ndevelopment partners. \n \n7.  The TA is directly linked with the government's National Development Strategy, the \nADB 2009\u20132012 country operations business plan approved on 6 October 2009,4 and \ninitiating paper for the country partnership strategy (2009\u20132013) dated October 2008. The \nTA is consistent with the parliamentary resolution on some immediate measures to be taken \nto reduce air pollution (Resolution No. 46, 2007), which has as a goal the reduction of air \npollution and improvement of air quality in Ulaanbaatar. The TA is consistent with the vision \nof MUB as expressed in the Ulaanbaatar city air pollution reduction master plan. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be the improved air quality in Ulaanbaatar.5 A reduction in \nconcentrations of particulates, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide, in both the peripheral ger \nareas and developed city center of Ulaanbaatar, is expected to reduce the incidence of \nrespiratory disease across the city. The outcome of the TA will be the establishment of a \ncoordinated program for the introduction of clean technology and alternative fuels for heating.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will assist the NCC to develop knowledge and programs needed to reduce air \npollution in Ulaanbaatar. Specifically, it will assist the government to develop programs to \npromote adoption of more efficient stoves and replace HOBs, and will pilot the mechanism \nfor replacing ger stoves. A key indicator of the TA's success is the ability of the government \nto mobilize resources for full-scale implementation of these programs.  \n \n10.  The TA has three components: (i) mechanism to promote adoption of cleaner burning \nstoves for gers; (ii) program for HOB replacement; and (iii) institutional strengthening, and a \nmechanism for monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n11.  The first component will (i) establish laboratory capacity for testing emissions from \nthe  combustion  of  fuels  in  domestic  heating  stoves;  (ii)  assist  stove  manufacturers  to \ndevelop improved stove designs; (iii) develop a subsidy voucher distribution mechanism for \nhouseholds to replace their current heating stoves with cleaner models; (iv) carry out a pilot \nprogram to test this mechanism in one or two khoroos in a district of Ulaanbaatar (up to \n1,000 households with new equipment); and (v) prepare and deliver an associated public \nawareness building program. Implementation of the mechanism to reduce winter emissions \n                                                 \n3  MCC will consider the proposed investment project in December 2009. \n4  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n5  This affects indoor air quality also, as all indoor air is influenced by outdoor air quality. \n ", "  3\nin  ger  areas  will  be  piloted  during  the  2009\u20132010  and  2010\u20132011  winter  seasons. \nConsensus on final pilot design will be developed through meetings and workshops among \nmajor stakeholders.  \n \n12.  The second component will (i) develop the criteria for, and compile a prioritized list of, \nHOBs in need of replacement; (ii) carry out a boiler replacement study, comprising the \npreparation of technical design, and prefeasibility, environmental, and other preparatory \nstudies required for the replacement of around 16 small-polluting boilers in public institutions \nin Ulaanbaatar; and (iii) prepare feasibility studies for HOB replacement, finalize designs, \nand develop bidding documents based on international standards. Environmental monitoring \nrequirements will be incorporated in the bidding documents. \n \n13.  The third component will (i) support the NCC to develop documentation for the \npreparation, development, and piloting of the air pollution reduction mechanism; (ii) assist \nthe NCC in developing a program, including an operations manual, that would scale up \nimplementation of the voucher distribution mechanism for households to replace their current \nheating stoves for cleaner models; (iii) assist the NCC in developing its capability to mobilize \nresources for the implementation of the mechanism, such as the proposed MCC Mongolia \nclean air project; (iv) develop mechanisms to enable all stakeholders to play an active role in \nTA activities; and (v) assist the NCC in managing the TA and the pilot project, and in \nregularly organizing and reporting on aid coordination meetings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund6 under the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The government will finance the \nremaining $50,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions. The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed  in  line  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2008,  as \namended from time to time). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MMRE will be the executing agency for the TA and will coordinate its activities with \nMUB. MUB will be involved in all TA components with a specific focus on HOB replacement \nand ger area emission reduction elements. It will play a leading role in TA awareness-raising \nand community participation activities. MMRE has an established project implementation unit \nfor ADB-assisted projects; it will be responsible for the TA.  \n \n16.  The government will form a TA steering committee chaired by the MMRE director of \nthe Fuel Policy Department, and vice-chaired by the head of the Municipal Air Quality \nAgency. The steering committee will comprise representatives of the Ministry of Finance; \nMMRE; the Ministry of Nature, Environment and Tourism; and MUB. The steering committee \nwill oversee TA implementation, provide guidance and direction, and facilitate coordination \nand cooperation among stakeholders. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  require  136.7  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  \n8.7 person-months of international and 128 person-months of national consultants to carry \nout the terms of reference outlined in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged as \nindividuals  and  through  a  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). To ensure that TA activities can begin \nduring the 2009\u20132010 winter season, when a stove replacement mechanism will be piloted, \ntwo  consultants\u2014one  national  (4  person-months)  and  one  international  (1.5  person-\n                                                 \n6  Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "4   \nmonths)\u2014will be recruited as individuals to commence activities related to the establishment \nof the laboratory and stove testing. The remaining consultant inputs will be engaged as a \nfirm using quality- and cost-based selection with quality-to-cost ratio of 80:20. Advance \nrecruitment of consultants will be requested to ensure timely implementation. Laboratory \nequipment  will  be  procured  using  the  shopping  procedure  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Other equipment will be \nprocured under the consulting contract with a firm using shopping procedure in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. All equipment to be procured under the TA will be \nturned over to MMRE and MUB after TA completion. In addition to staff participation, the \ngovernment will provide an office with utilities and telecommunications access; materials, \ndata, maps, and related documents required by the TA; and field travel of appropriate staff to \naccompany the consultants. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months commencing in December 2009 with \nexpected completion by November 2011. The consultants recruited as a firm will submit an \ninception report within 4 months of TA commencement. An interim report on activities during \nthe first full winter season will be submitted after 18 months. A workshop will be held with \nstakeholders from the government, MUB, and nongovernment organizations 2 months after \ncommencement  of  the  TA  to  discuss  the  inception  report  and  introduce  piloting \narrangements. Two  tripartite  meetings  will  be  held:  the  first  immediately  following  the \nstakeholder workshop, and the second following submission of the draft final report. A final \nreport incorporating comments will be submitted 2 weeks after the second tripartite meeting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund \nunder  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  Ulaanbaatar  Clean  Air,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "Appendix 1 5\n \nPRELIMINARY DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources/ \nPerformance  Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks  \n       \nImpact   Long-term downward trend  Ministry of Nature,  Assumptions \nImproved air quality in  of daily average  Environment and   \nUlaanbaatar  concentration of pollution in  Tourism official air  The NCC continues to \nwinter months; by 2015 the  quality data  operate \ncontribution of PM  and     \n10\nPM  from ger heating    MMRE and MUB \n2.5\nreduced to half that of 2008    collaborate well \n   \nBy 2015, 90% of   \nbeneficiaries in pilot area   \nperceive substantial   \nimprovement in air quality   \n   \nCarbon dioxide emissions  Survey of \nreduced by at least 80,000  beneficiary \ntons per year when all  perceptions \nstoves replaced \n \n       \nOutcome       \nCoordinated program  Mechanism to promote  NCC   Assumptions  \nfor introducing clean  adoption of clean burning   \ntechnology and  stoves developed, based  NCC working group \nalternative fuels for  on   and the NCC operate \nheating established  \uf02d the first acceptable  efficiently and \nstove-fuel  effectively. \ncombinations   \npublished, by January  Development partners \n2010;  cooperate. \n\uf02d stove emissions   \nstandards, by March  Activities meet \n2010;  appraisal standards of \n\uf02d protocol and manual  financiers. \nfor stove testing, by   \nFebruary 2010;  Risks \n\uf02d mechanism for   \npromoting stove  Financial crisis \nproduction and  constrains or diverts \ndistribution, piloted by  resources. \nend of March 2010;   \nPolitical instability in \n\uf02d bidding documents \ngovernment delays \nready for replacing 16 \ndecision making. \nHOBs by May 2010; \n \n\uf02d MMRE endorsed and \nParliamentary \nlaunched action plan \ncommittees disagree \nto introduce clean \nwith mechanism \nstoves and fuels by \ndeveloped by the NCC. \nOctober 2010.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 6      Appendix 1 \nData Sources/ \nPerformance  Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks  \n       \nOutputs       \n1.

Scope \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will help the government develop a mechanism and \nprogram to promote adoption of more efficient stoves and heat-only boilers (HOBs), and will \npilot the mechanism for replacement of ger stoves. A key indicator of the TA's success will \nbe  the  ability  of  the  government  to  mobilize  resources  for  full  implementation  of  the \nmechanism to replace HOBs. The TA has three components: (i) mechanism to reduce winter \nemissions in ger areas; (ii) program for HOB replacement; and (iii) institutional strengthening \nand  a  mechanism  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  International  and  national \nconsultants will be engaged as individuals and through a firm in accordance with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). Consultants will work closely with the Ministry of Mineral Resources and \nEnergy, and with the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar during the assignment.  \n \n2.  The services comprise three linked parts, elements of which can run concurrently: \n \n(i)  Part A: HOB replacement including a feasibility study for boiler replacement \n(month 4), and preparation of bidding documents (month 6);  \n(ii)  Part B: development of a mechanism to reduce winter emissions in ger areas \nincluding  (a)  awareness  raising  campaign  (from  month  4),  (b)  subsidy \ndistribution mechanism (month 5), (c) laboratory testing and certification (from \nmonth 2), (d) stove research and development, cost effectiveness analysis, \nand production capacity building (from month 6), (e) piloting the mechanism \n(months 5\u20139), and (f) reporting and project document preparation, including \nreporting to ADB (continuous); and  \n(iii)  Part C: institutional strengthening, M&E mechanism including establishment \nof a coordination and management unit (month 1), development of an M&E \nsystem (month 2), and management of activities and reporting (continuous). \n \n3.  International experts will work jointly with Mongolian experts to carry out all aspects \nof the TA. This is anticipated to require 8.7 person-months of international and 128 person-\nmonths of national consultants. \n \nB.  Detailed Scope of Work of International Experts \n \n1.  Part A \n \n4.  Boiler expert (international, 1.5 person-months). The specialist will have at least 8 \nyears of experience in designing, evaluating, and installing coal-fired heating boilers with up \nto 10 megawatt capacity; experience in Mongolia is a plus. \n \n5.  The specialist will investigate the feasibility of, and develop a plan for, replacement of \nabout 16 HOBS in public institutions in ger districts. The scope of work will include the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)   Develop the criteria for and compile a prioritized list of HOBs in need of boiler \nswitch-outs.
