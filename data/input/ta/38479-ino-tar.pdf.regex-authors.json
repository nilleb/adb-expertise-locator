INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2006  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  Indonesia \n(Government) requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare the proposed Regional Roads \nDevelopment  Project  for  possible  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing.  This  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) was included in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program \n2006\u20132009 for Indonesia.1 The Government\u2019s medium-term strategy for the Ministry of Public \nWorks  (MPW)  identified  road  development  in  less-developed  regions,  including  northern \nKalimantan  and  southern  Java,  as  a  priority.  After  several  missions  to  Indonesia,2 the \nGovernment  agreed  to  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference (TOR) for the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia is a middle-income country, with varied development across its provinces and \nislands.  Access  to  roads  is  key  to  the  country\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy,  as  improved \ntransport accessibility reduces poverty both directly and indirectly, e.g., through better access to \neducation and health facilities. \n \n3.  For medium-term development goals, the Government has committed to raising levels of \nsustainable economic growth, creating jobs, and accelerating achievement of its millennium \ndevelopment  goals.  It  identifies  infrastructure  development  and  investment\u2014including  that \nrelated to road transport\u2014as critical to meeting these objectives. Improved access to markets, \nstrengthened intermodal integration, enhanced transport networks in less developed and border \nregions,  and  advanced  regional  integration  and  trade  opportunities  will  result  from  this \nGovernment emphasis on road transport. The Government, through MPW, has given high \npriority  to  improving  the  road  system  through  (i)  removal  of  capacity  constraints,  (ii) \nrehabilitation of substandard highways, (iii) development of a sustainable maintenance system \nto preserve the country\u2019s road system, including increased expenditure, (iv) investment in less \ndeveloped area road networks, and (v) improved border area connections. \n \n4.  Road transport is the dominant mode in Indonesia, meeting 83% of passenger and 70% \nof  freight  demand.  In  recent  years,  MPW  has  concentrated  major  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation on key highways in Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi.3 While about 45% \nof  the  road  network  is  paved\u2014including  more  than  75%  of  the  national  road  system\u2014 \nnon-national road network coverage is poor. Road network density is already low nationally at \nabout 0.4 kilometer (km) per 1,000 square kilometers (km2), but is significantly lower in less \ndeveloped regions.4 There are good road networks in northern Java and in parts of Sumatra, \nbut road conditions in the rest of the country are fair to poor, especially in less developed \nprovinces and border regions. Outside of Java and Sumatra, traffic is generally low on national \nand provincial roads.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA concept paper was included as Appendix A8.5, and it first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 \nOctober 2007. \n2  Separate missions were fielded between 1 July and 29 August 2007 and 2\u201313 October 2007 to visit proposed \nproject areas, hold preliminary discussions with the Government, and define the overall scope of the proposed \nproject. \n3  Several years of minimal maintenance expenditure after the Asian financial crisis in 1997 caused a major repair \nbacklog, resulting in large neglected sections of the national road network. \n4  The road density for Kalimantan is only 0.19 km per 1,000 km2, compared to 0.90 km per 1,000 km2 in Java. ", "2   \n5.  Road sector development faces several ongoing problems: road maintenance, vehicle \noverloading,  and  road  safety.  Poor  interdepartmental  coordination  and  overlapping  or \nambiguous  responsibilities  further  contribute  to  ineffective  implementation  of  sector-level \nprograms.5 \n \n6.  Road maintenance funding for national highways is adequate, but poor maintenance \nplanning and inefficient procedures impact its overall effectiveness. Variable quality of work and \nsupervision  for  maintenance  and  new  construction  reduces  the  life  of  road  assets  that \nsubsequently require higher maintenance expenditure. In addition, the common practice of \nvehicle overloading accelerates the deterioration of national roads. Recently, an increased \nnumber of weighbridge stations have been constructed, but they are relatively ineffective due to \nimproper  records,  poor  management,  governance  problems,  inadequate  equipment \nmaintenance,  ineffective  implementation  of  traffic  regulations,  and  poor  inter-  and  intra-\ngovernment cooperation. \n \n7.  Road  safety  is  poor  due  to  a  rapid  increase  in  vehicle  ownership,  both  two-  and  \nfour-wheel, on an inadequate road network, which leads to a drastic increase in traffic accidents. \nRoad safety improvement is difficult due to substandard driver education and testing, poor \nvehicle  safety  standards,  low  awareness  of  accident  risks,  and  limited  use  of  road  safety \nmeasures in accident-prone locations. \n \n8.  Although international donors have been active in Indonesia since 1970s, the Asian \nFinancial Crisis in 1997 and recent decentralization laws have negated many improvements \nachieved under previous programs. Donor support has continued to the road sector, accounting \nfor about 30% of MPW\u2019s 2007 road budget. ADB and the World Bank provide assistance for \noverloading regulation, ADB and AusAID finance road safety programs, and all donors support \ncapacity development for MPW, the Directorate General of Highways (DGH), and the Ministry of \nTransportation (MOT).   \n \n9.  Donors  actively  coordinate  with  DGH  and  MOT  to  ensure  adequate  funding  for \ngovernment  needs  and  sufficient  segregation  of  network  coverage  under  donor-assisted \nprojects.  MPW  strategic  plans  for  2006\u20132009  and  2010\u20132104  have  identified  priority \ninvestments to improve road infrastructure in southern Java and to address development of \nborder areas in Kalimantan. \n \n10.  In Java, economic growth and infrastructure development has favored regions and cities \non the north coast, with south coast regions lagging far behind.6 Improved road infrastructure in \nsouthern Java is necessary for increased economic growth to improve access to markets and to \nattract investment in that area. The national road network in the south is incomplete, with some \nroad sections of the main Southern Trans Java Highway not yet constructed, not classified as \nnational highway, or constructed below national standards. There are gaps in network coverage, \nparticularly in coastal areas, and cross-island linkages are limited. \n \n11.  Kalimantan is a resource-rich island with low population and road densities. Economic \nactivity  is  concentrated  in  coastal  regions  due  to  difficult  conditions  and  terrain  that  have \nrestricted interior development. Road network development is key to ensure that economic \n                                                 \n5  Institutional improvement in road safety issues is further effected by poor coordination with the police department, \nwhich is responsible for law enforcement, traffic management, and vehicle registration. \n6  The 30 km-wide strip along the north coast of Java contains about one half of the country\u2019s population, including \nthe major cities of Jakarta, Semarang, and Surabaya; all major ports; and about 65% of the country\u2019s economic \nactivity. \n ", "  3\ndevelopment  will  occur  in  these  less  developed  and  remote  areas.  Whereas  the  national \nhighway  network  has  expanded  along  the  coast  from  provincial  capitals,  the  interior  road \nnetwork is very limited and characterized by low-standard roads, poor maintenance, and low \ntraffic  volumes.  DGH,  through  World  Bank  financing,  is  undertaking  the  Kalimantan  Road \nNetwork  Development  Study  (KRNDS),  which  will  develop  a  20-year  strategic  plan  for \nKalimantan\u2019s road and inland waterway network.7 The KRNDS will define a priority-ranked \nlisting of roads for all Kalimantan provinces on a multicriteria and economic basis. \n \n12.  Kalimantan\u2019s border with Malaysia\u2019s Sarawak and Sabah states has developed slowly, \nwith only Entikong in West Kalimantan possessing full customs, immigration, quarantine and \nsecurity (CIQS) and government agency facilities. Two other border posts, at Aruk and Badua, \nare at an advanced stage of developing full border facilities, and are expected to open in 2008. \n \n13.  Through  the  Brunei  Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines-East  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), ADB has funded TA for improving CIQS \nfacilities and procedures, which included analysis of road and sea barriers to trade, identified \ninstitutional and procedural problems, and transport link capacity constraints. ADB will provide \nadditional  regional  TA  support in  2008  under  the  BIMP-EAGA  initiative,  which  will include \ndevelopment of a land-based transport corridor connecting West Kalimantan province with \nSarawak state. This assistance will address transnational issues and the need to develop inter-\nregional transport agreements to remove various barriers; assess legal, policy, regulatory, and \ninstitutional environments; and identify gaps that constrain economic integration in BIMP-EAGA. \n \n14.  In  addition,  under  the  ADB-funded  Road  Rehabilitation  (Sector)  Project8 and  Road \nRehabilitation 2 Project9 and the World Bank-funded National Road Improvement Project, MOT \nis receiving support to improve its performance. Weighbridges are being constructed through \nprivate sector operation and management arrangements, and these projects also support road \nsafety programs for black spot improvements, creating awareness in local communities, and \ntraining of MOT personnel. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the PPTA will be to facilitate the transport of people and goods more \nefficiently and cost-effectively within the Project provinces, East and West Kalimantan and \nsouthern Java; nationally, between northern and southern Java; and subregionally, between the \nnorthern Kalimantan provinces and Malaysia. The outcome of the PPTA will be a multitranche \nfinance facility project design and feasibility study for tranche 1, agreed upon by ADB and the \nGovernment. The study will outline a project, which is economically and technically feasible and \nsocially and environmentally acceptable, to rehabilitate and upgrade road links and facilities \nalong identified corridors. An initial poverty and social analysis for the proposed project is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n7  The KRNDS draft final report will be submitted in March 2008. \n8  ADB. 2001.

Its scope will include (i) \nan assessment of existing national and strategic roads within the northern Kalimantan and \nsouthern Java corridors, and feasibility studies for prioritized improvement works for selected \nroad  sections  within  these  corridors10;  and  (ii)  an  assessment  of  key  road  sector  issues, \nincluding institutional and implementation arrangements for the proposed project. \n \n17.  The project preparation component activities will include: (i) assessing and prioritizing \nimprovement  works  for  selected  road  sections,  using  the  KRNDS  to  identify  priority  road \nsections  in  Kalimantan;  (ii)  analyzing  transport  links  to  determine  economic  and  technical \nfeasibility,  social  and  environmental  impacts,  and  develop  a  methodology  for  prioritizing \nselection of roads to upgrade; (iii) preparing a matrix to rank road sections to form logical \nprojects for a range of funding levels; and (iv) reviewing facilities at Indonesia\u2013Malaysia border \nposts in northern Kalimantan. \n   \n18.  The PPTA will also address road sector policy issues, including (i) a review of the Java \nArterial Road Network Study11 and associated road sector issues, (ii) vehicle overloading, (iii) \nroad safety for users and local communities, and (iv) institutional capacity. The latter activity will \ninclude  identifying  necessary  training  and  strengthening  programs,  reviewing  ongoing \nimplementation problems in donor-funded projects, and assessing procurement and contract \nmanagement issues. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1,625,000 equivalent, of which ADB will \nfinance $1,300,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance $325,000 equivalent \nby providing counterpart staff, office furniture and facilities, local transport, local communications, \nmaps, reports, and other information. The details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  MPW, as the Executing Agency, will have overall responsibility for the Government\u2019s \ncontribution and implementation. DGH, under MPW, will be the Implementing Agency. Due to \nrecent  experience  with  other  ADB  projects,  DGH  has  the  capacity  to  handle  this  PPTA \nsuccessfully. The Government will utilize the existing road sector steering committee to oversee \nand coordinate all activities for carrying out the TA. The steering committee is chaired by the \nNational  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  deputy  minister  and  comprises \nrepresentatives from MPW, BAPPENAS, and the ministries of transport and finance. The DGH \nwill set up a subunit staffed with counterpart personnel for day-to-day coordination and to work \nwith the PPTA consultants and other government agencies. The DGH will also provide office \naccommodation, local communication facilities, office support staff, and other administrative \nsupport. \n                                                 \n10 The estimated length of road for the North Kalimantan Corridor is 1,300 km in West Kalimantan and 600 km in East \nKalimantan. For the Southern Java Corridor, the length of road to be reviewed is estimated to be 1,700 km. \nFeasibility studies will cover about 800 km of priority road sections. \n11 The Java Arterial Road Network Study was completed in 2002. It focused mainly on road improvements in northern \nJava. \n ", "  5\n21.  The PPTA will require about 145 person-months of consulting services, including 28 \nperson-months  of  international  and  117  person-months  of  national  consulting  services. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  with \nsimplified technical proposals.12 The PPTA will be implemented over 14 months, from May 2008 \nto June 2009. The outline TOR for consultants is in Appendix 4.  \n \n22.  The consultants will submit the following reports: (i) an inception report, 1 month after \nservices commence; (ii) an interim report, at the end of the third month of services; (iii) a draft \nfinal report, at the end of the ninth month, which presents all study results, including surveys, \nfindings, recommendations, and social and environmental safeguard documentation; and (iv) a \nfinal report, 1 month after receiving comments on the draft final report from the DGH and ADB. \n \n23.  Tripartite meetings will be held after the submission of the inception, interim, and draft \nfinal reports. Workshops13 will be held before submission of the interim and draft final reports to \npresent the proposed project to the Government and other stakeholders.14 The consultants will \nconduct seminars on ADB\u2019s resettlement guidelines in each project province to raise awareness \nof process and implementation requirements. \n \n24.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  transport  planning,  transport \neconomics,  highway  and  pavement  design,  road  safety,  environmental  assessment, \nresettlement,  indigenous  people  and  other  social  development  issues,  and  institutional \ndevelopment. The national consultants will have expertise in transport planning, highway design, \npavement design, structural design, economics, environmental assessment, resettlement, and \nsocial development. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nAn improved transportation infrastructure is a goal of the National Mid-Term Development Plan of 2004\u20132009, as it \nopens isolated regions and supports economic development and national security. In the National Poverty Alleviation \nStrategy (Strategi Nasional Penanggunangan Kemiskinan), infrastructure development through national transportation \nmanagement is a stated government policy for improving economic development and poverty reduction. \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.) \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe proposed project will generally improve the lives of those who live along the new roads by providing better access to \neducation facilities, health facilities, and government services. Improved road access will also increase economic \nopportunities for those who live along the road package areas, leading to poverty reduction.   \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \nFurther social analysis is required for indigenous peoples, conflict prevention, and gender impacts.  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? $80,000 \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)?  \nYes. Pro-poor and socioeconomic inclusion program design is required for the proposed project\u2019s less-developed and \nindigenous community areas and is especially important for Kalimantan. Discussions with local governments on \ntargeting poverty alleviation programs in these areas are suggested, since economic gaps between locals and migrants \ncould widen with improved road access.  \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project?  \nMajor beneficiaries are general road users. The poor also benefit from easy access to other areas, lower transportation \ncosts, better access to government services and public facilities, and decreased prices for daily necessities. The poor \nand indigenous communities may be further disadvantaged by migrants or other population groups with stronger \neconomic backgrounds who participate in new economic opportunities opened by improved road access. Social \nassessments will examine the potential negative impacts on poor communities and indigenous peoples, as well as \npossible social conflicts among various groups. The impact will be assessed by gender and ethnicity. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project?   \nIf the impact is significant, needs include major economic resources protection and the provision of employment \nopportunities or training for the poor and other disadvantaged groups. Microcredit programs, in collaboration with CBOs, \nwill be explored in the proposed project areas. In East and West Kalimantan, social analysis will assess constraints \nfaced by ethnic minority groups and other vulnerable peoples and will recommend measures to address them. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them?  \nEconomic limitation and lack of necessary skills for poor and indigenous communities may become major barriers to \nparticipating in the economic opportunities opened by the road projects. During the PPTA, assessments will be \nconducted for employment and small-scale economic development package programs for the poor and indigenous \npeoples. The use of existing government and donor programs will be explored. Through public consultation with \nconcerned CBOs and leaders, programs will be designed to prevent social conflict that may arise. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.   Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \nDistrict and sub-district government officials, local parliamentary members, development and environmental NGOs, \nindigenous people organizations, affected community representatives, women\u2019s organizations, national park and natural \nconservation agency officials, local tourism offices, plantation and forestry offices, and forest concession/plantation \ncompanies located in the proposed project areas.  \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)?  \nA series of public consultations must be conducted at the district level, and if necessary at the provincial level, which \ninvolves concerned and relevant CBOs, environmental NGOs, and relevant local government officials and agencies in \nthe proposed project areas. The public must be informed about final design and programs to avoid land speculation and \nsocial disruption.  \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe consultant will prepare the C&P plan during the PPTA. \n \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program?  \nFemale-headed households are commonly found in Kalimantan, as male members often leave the villages to work in \nMalaysia. Improved access to public facilities, e.g., education and health, will provide positive impacts to the female \npopulation\u2019s well-being.  \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nby improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in \ndecision-making?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe proposed project will improve women\u2019s access to education and health facilities as well as to other economic \nresources. A gender strategy will be prepared during the PPTA for various project components. \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No     \nThere is no direct adverse impact on women. However, the influx of workers and migrants can pose a potential risk of \nHIV/AIDS and trafficking of women and children. In addition, resettlement activities can affect women\u2019s subsistence \nactivities. Increased road accidents may occur, impacting the majority of the road users who are area women traveling to \ntheir swidden fields. To address these potential adverse impacts, gender-specific measures will be included in the \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness programs, road safety awareness campaign, resettlement plan, and relevant \nsocial development activities. \nIII.
