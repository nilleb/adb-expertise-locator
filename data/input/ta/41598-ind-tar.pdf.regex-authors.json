The  mandate  of  the  National  Capital  Region  Planning  Board  (NCRPB) 1  is  to \nsystematically develop India\u2019s National Capital Region (NCR), which covers 33,578 square \nkilometers spanning 14 districts in Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh and the National \nCapital  Territory  of  Delhi.  The  NCRPB  emphasizes  building  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure  and  has  plans  to  scale  up  support  for  urban  infrastructure  development \nsignificantly in the next 5 years. The Government of India requested technical assistance (TA)2 \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to enhance the capacities of the NCRPB and the \nimplementing agencies associated with the NCRPB. ADB\u2019s Country Operations Business Plan, \n2007\u20132009 focuses on supporting urban infrastructure development, especially water supply \nand  sewerage.3 The  TA  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment and is included in the country operations and business plan, 2008\u20132009. A Fact-\nFinding  Mission  visited  Delhi  during  11\u201312  and  22\u201323  October  2007  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the purpose, output, methodology, key activities, cost \nestimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1) and on terms of reference for consultant support. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  NCRPB  and  NCR  Development. The NCRPB has provided financial assistance to \nparticipating  state  governments,  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs),  housing  boards,  development \nauthorities,  and  other  parastatals  for  infrastructure  development  projects  in  the  NCR  and \nidentified counter-magnet area towns4 over the last 20 years. To date the NCRPB has financed \n171 infrastructure projects involving total outlays of more than Rs113 billion. It has sanctioned \nloans totaling Rs39.02 billion and had disbursed Rs26.28 billion as of 31 March 2007.  \n \n3.  Scaling Up NCRPB Support. The NCRPB is helping state governments, ULBs, and \ndevelopment authorities to prepare master plans, development plans, and project plans for \ncreating basic urban infrastructure in NCR towns and cities to achieve the goals of the 2001 \nRegional Plan. The projects identified by the NCRPB for support during the 11th Five Year Plan \n(2007\u20132012) involve a total outlay of Rs150 billion (approximately $3.8 billion), including a loan \ncomponent of Rs110 billion. To achieve and manage the targeted lending of Rs110 billion in the \nnext few years, the institutional capabilities of the NCRPB and of participating implementing \nagencies  need  to  be  enhanced.  Based  on  discussions  with  key  stakeholders,  capacity \ndevelopment  is  needed  in  the  following  areas:  project  selection,  development,  appraisal, \nexecution, and monitoring and evaluation; compliance with safeguards; and management of the \nloan portfolio. In addition, support is required to translate the Regional Plan into subregional \nplans,  master  plans,  development  plans,  and  project  plans  for  creating  basic  urban \ninfrastructure in NCR towns and cities. \n \n                                                 \n1 The  National  Capital  Region  Planning  Board,  a  statutory  body  under  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development,  \nGovernment of India, was constituted under the National Capital Region Planning Board Act, 1985 (Act No. 2 of \n1985) enacted by the Parliament with the concurrence of the Legislatures of the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, and \nUttar Pradesh. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 31 October 2007. \n3   ADB. 2006. India: Country Operations Business Plan, 2007\u20132009. Manila. \n4  The 2001 Regional Plan identified the following counter-magnet areas to the NCR for first-stage intervention: \nHissar in Haryana, Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, Patiala in Punjab, Kota in Rajasthan, and Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh.  \n \n ", "2   \n4.  The  NCRPB  needs  strengthening  in  areas  such  as  credit  appraisal,  portfolio \nmanagement, resource mobilization, interest rebate incentives management, and debt recovery. \nThis will entail reviewing and upgrading systems, procedures, and manuals and developing the \nrequisite technical skills in managing planning and development. To ensure timely completion of \ninfrastructure development projects, a computerized monitoring system is needed to keep track \nof the progress of project implementation. Such a monitoring system will have to be part of a \nlarger system of computerized enterprise resource planning that encompasses the NCRPB, \nULBs,  development  authorities,  state  government  departments,  and  other  parastatals. \nAdministration of a loan incentive package will require setting up appropriate administrative \nstructures and procedures to monitor and evaluate project implementation in relation to timely \ncompletion, cost adherence, and quality control in an effective and transparent manner.  \n \n5.  Strengthening Integrated Urban Planning Processes. The preparation of subregional \nplans and of master plans and development plans for NCR towns and cities is slow because of \nthe lack of modern planning tools and techniques and of hardware and software in state NCR \ncells and relevant development authorities. Planning and development authorities need to have \naccess  to  expertise  in  areas  such  as  the  techniques  and  principles  of  planning  at  the \nmetropolitan level, the marketing of towns to attract private investment, and the development \nand implementation of projects. Because of different levels of commitment to implementing the \nRegional Plan by various stakeholders, compliance with and implementation of the Regional \nPlan is uneven. In this context, best practices, experiences, and legal frameworks in cities with \noverlapping administrations and institutional jurisdictions may be examined, including London; \nParis; Seoul; Tokyo; and Washington, DC.   \n \n6.  Project Development and Execution. The lack of capacity to conceive, design, and \ndevelop good quality infrastructure development projects has emerged as a major constraint. \nImplementing agencies need to come up with sound and viable detailed project reports (DPRs) \nthat  conform  to  development  plans,  comply  with  standard  norms,  and  consider  various \nalternatives.  Comprehensive  guidelines  are  needed  for  DPR  preparation  in  different  urban \ninfrastructure subsectors based on international best practices. The lack of capacity in relation \nto good quality, large infrastructure development projects that cater to the needs of more than \none state is a major bottleneck to the NCR\u2019s accelerated development, and this needs to be \naddressed by means of improved institutional arrangements and exposure of key stakeholders \nto  best  practices.  The  NCRPB  will  have  to  play  a  proactive  role  in  the  selection  and \ndevelopment of appropriate infrastructure projects and in establishing policies and priorities. \nMoreover, human resource development is required in the NCRPB, in NCR cells in participating \nstates, and in implementing agencies for successful implementation of the 2021 Regional Plan.   \n \n7.  Enabling Public\u2013Private Partnerships.  Public investment in urban infrastructure is \nunlikely to be sufficient to address the huge infrastructure financing gap. Hence enabling private \ncapital infusion into urban infrastructure development in the NCR is critical. Moreover, well-\nstructured public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) can enhance efficiency and result in better quality \nurban  infrastructure.  However,  undertaking  PPPs  requires  skills  in  identification  of  viable \nprojects, assessing and allocating risks, designing and executing complex agreements, and \nmanaging contracts, and the NCRPB and implementing agencies need support for building such \nskills. \n \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The outcome of the TA is to improve business processes and skills at the NCRPB, state-\nlevel NCR cells, and other implementing agencies in planning for urban infrastructure and \nconceiving, designing, developing,  appraising,  and  implementing  good  quality  infrastructure \nprojects for the planned development of the NCR. This would lead to effective and timely scaling \nup of urban infrastructure to (i) improve the quality of basic urban services in the NCR, (ii) \ndevelop counter-magnet towns, (iii) reduce in-migration into Delhi, and (iv) accelerate economic \ngrowth in the NCR.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will have three components as outlined in the following subsections.  \n \n10.  Component A: Business Process Reengineering and Skills Development for the \nNCRPB. The business process reengineering will focus on developing (i) an effective financial \nmanagement system, particularly in relation to loan management and integrating loan approvals, \ndisbursals, and repayments with a project monitoring system; (ii) reviewing and upgrading the \nNCRPB\u2019s systems, procedures, and manuals in such areas as project appraisal, credit appraisal, \nportfolio management, risk management and treasury operations, resource mobilization, and \ndebt recovery; and (iii) developing a proposal for computerized enterprise resource planning. \n \n11.  The reengineering will involve identifying, reviewing, and documenting the NCRPB\u2019s \ncurrent  business  processes  and  workflows.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  the  review, \nrecommendations for business process improvements will be developed and prioritized. This \nprocess will include (i) preparing a comprehensive list of all applicable best practices based on \nexperience  elsewhere  with  urban  infrastructure  funds  and  financial  intermediaries;  (ii) \ndetermining their applicability to the NCRPB\u2019s environment; (iii) consolidating and prioritizing the \nbest practice recommendations based on the potential benefits, the resources needed, and the \ntime frame for implementation; (iv) drafting descriptions of the new business processes; and (v) \nimplementing the new processes.   \n \n12.  Component B: Skills and Process Improvements in Project Preparation. The TA \nwill strengthen implementing agencies\u2019 management and review skills and processes relating to \nundertaking project feasibility studies, preparing DPRs, and carrying out detailed engineering \ndesign. This component of the TA will support the preparation of six demonstration feasibility \nstudies and DPRs that include all due diligence documentation required for processing projects \nin  accordance  with  best  practices,  including  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines.  The  following \nactivities will be carried out as a part of DPR preparation: conducting technical, institutional, \neconomic, and financial feasibility analyses of six identified urban infrastructure projects in six \nsample implementing agencies; and conducting due diligence on the projects in relation to \nsafeguards, including environmental assessment reports and resettlement plans, and preparing \nenvironmental assessment frameworks and resettlement frameworks. The TA will support the \npreparation of standard procedure manuals for identifying projects and preparing DPRs. The TA \nwill use reports on the deficiencies of current practices, and standard protocol manuals to train \nthe implementing agencies how to prepare DPRs, which will also include field trips to expose \nimplementing agencies to best practices. The TA will help with the development of a user-\nfriendly website for the implementing agencies that will include various manuals and guidelines \nfor preparing DPRs. \n ", "4   \n \n13.  Component C: Urban and Regional Planning and Other Activities. The TA will help \nthe NCRPB and implementing agencies to accelerate the implementation of the Regional Plan. \nThe TA will support three to four studies to provide information and insights to assist with the \nnext revisions of the Regional Plan and improve the urban planning process.  The TA will \nsupport field trips abroad to expose key stakeholders to world-class large capital regions that \nmust deal with different entities, various administrative zones, and unifying urban development \nauthorities. The TA will also support conferences and workshops in capital region development \nand regional planning, which will include an international conference in New Delhi on capital \nregion urban planning. Through the foregoing activities along with training and workshops, the \nTA will expose stakeholders in the NCRPB and implementing agencies to global best practices \nin managing integrated capital region development and planning and implementing projects. \nThe TA will support assessment of human resource development and management, including \nidentification of training needs, training institutes that can impart training, and imparting training. \nThe TA will also support the identification of opportunities for potential PPPs and awareness \nbuilding and skills development for enabling urban infrastructure PPPs in the NCR. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  help  address  institutional  and  implementation  issues  pertaining  to \naccelerating  urban  infrastructure  development  in  the  NCR  and  is  likely  to  lead  to  more \ninvestment in water supply, sewerage, solid waste management, and urban mass transport. It is \nalso expected to improve efficiencies in the NCR. More investment and improved efficiencies \nwill have a positive impact on basic urban services and thus a direct positive impact on the \nquality of life of the urban poor and on the urban environment.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,500,000 equivalent. An amount of $2,000,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance \nthe remaining $500,000 equivalent for office accommodation and transport, counterpart staff \nremuneration, per diems, and other expenditures. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are shown in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The NCRPB will be the Executing Agency. A Steering Committee will be set up headed \nby  the  member  secretary  of  the  NCRPB  and  consisting  of  senior  NCRPB  officers  and \nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Urban Development, the Department of Economic Affairs of \nthe Ministry of Finance, participating implementing agencies, and non-government organizations \nworking actively in the field of urban development in the NCR. The finance director of the \nNCRPB will be the project director of the TA and the convener of the Steering Committee. The \nSteering  Committee  will  meet  at  least  once  a  month  during  the  first  6  months  of  TA \nimplementation  and  at  least  once  every  2  months  during  the  remainder  of  the  TA \nimplementation period to guide and review the progress of the TA. \n \n17.  Activities under components A and C will be carried out by an international firm (36 \nperson-months of international consultants and 50 person-months of national consultants) and \ncomponent  B  will  be  carried  out  by  a  national  consulting  firm  (100  person-months).  The \ninternational and national firms will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based method of \nselection. A full technical proposal will be sought for selection of the international firm and a \nsimplified technical proposal will be sought for selection of the national firm. The indicative terms \nof reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The reporting schedule for the components A \n ", "  5\nand C will include the submission of an inception report, monthly progress reports, draft final \nreport and final report, which will be in addition to various reports, manuals and outputs of the \nTA. The reporting schedule for the component B will include the submission of an inception \nreport that includes a detailed work plan within 3 weeks of commencement of the TA; an interim \nreport containing conceptual studies of the subprojects and project feasibility reports within 3 \nmonths of commencement of the TA; a draft final DPR within 6\u20138 months of commencement of \nthe TA; and a final DPR within 12 months of commencement of the TA including the DPRs of \nthe six projects.   \n \n18.  ADB will engage consulting firms and individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Minor equipment \nand office supplies will be procured under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All equipment purchased under the TA will be \nhanded over to the NCRPB after TA completion. To facilitate implementation, the TA will use an \nadvance payment facility for training, seminars, conferences, and surveys. The amount of the \nadvance and its liquidation will be arranged in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Disbursement of \nTechnical Assistance Grant. The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months from May \n2008 to October 2009. The implementation plan is in Appendix 4. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis to the Government of India for \nCapacity Development of the National Capital Region Planning Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \n    Data   \n  Performance Targets/  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact       \nPlanned urban development  Improved basic urban  Household surveys  Assumption \nof the National Capital  services in the NCR    Macroeconomic \nRegion (NCR) leads to:    Government reports  stability maintained.   \nimprovement in the quality of  Accelerated economic     \nbasic urban services in the  growth in the NCR    Risk \nNCR; development of    In-migration into New \ncounter-magnet towns;  Development of counter- Delhi might continue, \nreduction in the in-migration  magnet towns and  leading to urban \ninto Delhi; and acceleration  reduction in the in- infrastructure \nof economic growth in the  migration.  shortages. \nNCR.     \n \n \nOutcome       \nBusiness processes and  The lending volume of the  Government reports  Assumption \nskills improve in the National  NCRPB increases by at    The Government is \nCapital Region Planning  least 200% during the  TA reports  committed to \nBoard (NCRPB) and various  11th Five Year Plan    development of the \nimplementing agencies in the  compared with its lending  ADB missions  NCR. \nNCR leading to accelerated  volume during the 10th     \nplanned urban infrastructure  Five Year Plan period    Risk \ndevelopment in the NCR and      The participating \ncounter-magnet towns  Urban infrastructure in  entities are reluctant to \n  the NCR improves  change. \nsignificantly during the   \n11th Five Year Plan. \n \nThe average project \nprocessing time is \nreduced by at least 10% \nfrom the baseline by June \n2009.  \n \nParticipating \nimplementing agencies \naccelerate \nimplementation of the \nregional plan by 10% \nover the baseline  \n \nAll detailed project \nreports (DPRs) submitted \nby implementing \nagencies after June 2009 \nare compliant with best \npractices.  \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7\n    Data   \n  Performance Targets/  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutputs         \n      Assumptions \n1.
