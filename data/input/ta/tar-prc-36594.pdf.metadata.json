During  the  2003  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide an advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) for a study on Safe Drinking Water1 and Sanitation2 for the Rural3 \nPoor. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in September 2003 and reached an \nunderstanding with the ministries of finance and health on the goals, purpose, outputs, cost \nestimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA.4 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Although the PRC has substantially reduced overall poverty during the last two decades, \ninequalities  between  regions  and  within  communities  have  increased.  The  ADB  Country \nStrategy  and  Program  (2003-2005)  focuses  on  four  interrelated  challenges:  (i)  growing \ninequality,  (ii)  building  an  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector,  (iii)  environmental \nsustainability, and (iv) regional cooperation. To support the Government's development strategy \nand reflect ADB's medium-term planning directions, the PRC operational strategy in the next \nfive years has been designed to promote pro-poor economic growth by enabling the poor to \nhave greater access to opportunities and benefits of economic prosperity. A key constraint on \nreducing poverty and promoting economic prosperity in rural areas is the lack, or absence of, \nsustainable community-based safe water supply and sanitation systems. \n \n3.  The lack of adequate rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) services impairs rural \ncommunity health, especially among the poor.5 Improved access to safe drinking water6 and \nsanitation is a key objective of the PRC\u2019s 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2001-2005), and will be \nreflected in the 11th FYP (2006-2010). Improved access to safe water and sanitation is also \ncritical to achieve the goals of the PRC\u2019s Outline for Poverty Alleviation and Development of \nChina\u2019s Rural Areas (2001-2010).7 The Government follows the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) to ensure environmental sustainability and aims to halve, by 2015, the proportion of \nrural people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This is one of the \nfew MDGs that the PRC has not been achieving ahead of schedule. \n \n4.  The relationship between access to safe water and sanitation, and poverty should be \nbetter understood by integrating improved analyses of community priorities and needs into \npolicymaking and implementation, and by delivering increased access to water and sanitation to \nthe poorest people. Access to water has significantly improved recently. However, this is not the \nsame as access to safe water. About 450 million rural people, 40% of the rural population, still \ncontinue to use unsafe water. About 76% have access to improved water that does not meet \nnational safety standards. The remaining 24% lack access to any improved water source. \nUnsafe water sources may have high pathogen loads due to (i) fecal or other contamination; (ii) \n                                                 \n1  \"Safe drinking water\" meets standards outlined in The National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee. July 2001. \nSanitary Standard for Drinking Water Quality\u2014Implementation Guideline for Rural Areas. Beijing.  \n2  \u201cSanitation\u201d includes latrines, health education, and hygiene promotion. \n3  \u201cRural\u201d includes all areas not under the jurisdiction of a city government. This TA will focus on townships not \nserving as the seat of a county government, and administrative and natural villages. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 17 July 2003. \n5  Rural poverty is generally based on an average per capita annual net income. The national poverty line is CNY635 \nand 300 kilograms of grain production per capita per year. \n6  \u201cAccess to water\u201d means \u201chaving to walk no further than 1 kilometer in the horizontal sense, and no further than \n100 meters in the vertical sense to the nearest water-point.\u201d \n7  Aimed at assisting 26 million rural people below the Government\u2019s official poverty line, the strategy identifies 592 \nkey working counties eligible for national poverty reduction funds. ", "2 \nwater with high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, arsenic, or salts; and (iii) growing industrial \nand  agricultural  chemical  pollution.  Some  areas  suffer  seasonal  water  shortages.  These \nproblems are manifested in high human intake of contaminants and prevalence of water-related \ndiseases, including high rates of diarrheal  diseases and viral hepatitis, and lower, although \nproblematic, incidence rates of cholera, dysentery, and typhoid.  \n \n5.  International experience has shown that for overall improvement in community health, \nprovision of safe water must be integrated with  latrine improvement, health education, and \nhygiene promotion. In the PRC, only 30% of the rural population uses sanitary latrines.8 Despite \nhealth education, behavior change has been slower to follow. Health messages must be made \nmore  effective  and  demonstrate  clearly  the  relationship  between  hygienic  behavior  and \nimproved health. A key area for enhancing future integrated RWSS projects should be hygiene \npromotion to realize behavioral change. Village schools provide a key focal point for such \nactivities. Integration of the provision of safe water and sanitation requires cooperation between \ngovernment ministries and agencies at various levels. \n \n6.  The Government recognizes the need to further strengthen national policy, strategy, and \noperational frameworks to develop the RWSS sector. National coordination of the sector is \nfragmented, involving a number of ministries with overlapping responsibilities. Local institutional \ncapabilities are limited, especially in management and operations. Financial resources are \nlimited, caused partly by poor cost recovery and inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n7.  Providing safe RWSS services will help improve rural living standards and reduce \nincidence rates of water-related diseases and associated medical expenditures, thus reducing \npoverty. Increased access to convenient and safe drinking water for the rural poor will also \ntranslate into increased time for productive activities and long-term human development. Water \ncollection has a particularly high opportunity cost for women and school-age children. For \nexample, especially in mountainous areas, time devoted to water carrying limits opportunities for \nwomen  (often  responsible  for  household  water  use  and  sanitation)  to  earn  income,  and \ndepresses children's (particularly girls') enrolment and active participation in schooling. Lack of \naccess  to  safe  water,  and  inadequate  sanitation  (e.g.,  use  of  common  latrines)  also \ndisproportionately burden women and children with disease, while rising costs of health services \nare particularly problematic in poor localities.9  \n  \n8.  Past efforts to develop the RWSS sector focused mainly on the construction of physical \nfacilities. The Government is now giving more attention to strengthening sector policy, strategy \nand operational frameworks, and institutional capabilities, including in the poorest communities \n(often located in remote mountainous areas). Policies must reflect the PRC\u2019s regional diversity. \nVery active sector support from a number of international organizations, notably the United \nNations Children's Fund and World Bank, in cooperation with the ministries of health and water \nresources, and Department of International Development of the United Kingdom have supported \nthe sector. This has created a base of knowledge on which future projects can build and add \nvalue. The work of community-based organizations and the All-China Women\u2019s Federation \ncomplement and strengthen this foundation. ADB has been active in water resource strategy \n                                                 \n8  The Government defines \u201csanitary latrines\u201d are those with full walls and a roof, odorless, and insect free. \n9  Especially in areas with high levels of male out-migration in search of urban employment, women bear a \ndisproportionate share of agricultural and household work, including caring for children and elderly family \nmembers, water collection, water use, and sanitation. The PRC\u2019s Agenda 21 calls for action to promote the role of \nwomen in sustainable development, and sets out specific issues to remove constraints hindering women\u2019s \nparticipation in sustainable development.  ", "    3 \nplanning and developing urban water supply and wastewater utilities in the PRC, from which \nlessons can be drawn and applied to the RWSS sector. \n \n9.  The TA will analyze key lessons from the experience and determine how these can be \nembedded in future RWSS policies and strategy. Lessons include the following:  \n \n(i)   Water supply and sanitation should be integrated.  \n(ii)   Drinking-water user groups should participate more, from scheme design to \nconstruction to operations, and ensure that decision-making on water and related \nissues involves a balanced mix of men and women in the villages.  \n(iii)   National  procedures,  such  as  manuals,  design,  and  construction  standards, \nshould be harmonized.  \n(iv)   Operation and quality maintenance models tailored to local situations are needed \nfor existing and new schemes.  \n(v)   National, provincial, and local capacity building should be ongoing.  \n(vi)   Short-term  processes  and  long-term  outcomes,  and  related  targeted \ndissemination should be monitored and evaluated.  \n(vii)   Financing of sustainable RWSS in poor townships and remote villages need \ninnovative, viable models that use participatory approaches to take into account \ncost recovery, water pricing, and willingness and ability to pay. \n \n10.  The TA is timely as it will help formulate the 11th FYP by developing the medium-term \n(2006-2010) RWSS sector investment plan and an outline RWSS strategy to achieve related \nMDGs in the long-term (2006-2015).  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The long-term goal of the TA is  to provide safe and sustainable water supply, and \nimprove rural sanitation, health, and hygiene behavior. The purpose of the TA is to help the \nGovernment  prepare  pro-poor  RWSS  policies,  and  a  strategic  investment  framework  for \nintegrated RWSS, focused on defining viable models for financing sustainable pro-poor RWSS \nsystems, and related institutional capacity building. \n \n12.  The scope of the TA will focus on preparing a medium-term RWSS sector plan and \ninvestment strategy for 2006-2010, for inclusion in the 11th FYP, and, in the context of realizing \nthe related MDGs, a longer-term outline strategy up to 2015. Strategy formulation will include (i) \ndetailed desk and field reviews; (ii) national and provincial workshops to ensure stakeholder \ninvolvement, recognition, and understanding of perspectives; (iii) synthesis of lessons from local \nand international projects; and (iv) about three case studies to test selected critical issues10, \nincluding an in-depth analysis of organizational models for water user groups (WUGs), pro-poor \nRWSS tariff setting, and community-based O&M models for existing RWSS schemes. The TA \nwill be nationwide but give particular attention to rural poor areas in the western region11 and \ncentral areas; decentralization initiatives; researching and promoting private sector participation; \nintegrating  water  supply  and  sanitation;  and  enhancing  participatory  processes,  including \n                                                 \n10  The case studies will research and analyze selected critical priority issues, based primarily on secondary \ninformation and supported by field visits. Selection of case studies will involve liaison with ongoing RWSS projects.  \n11 Western Region comprises 12 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, covering Chongqing, Gansu, \nGuangxi, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Yunnan; and 3 \nprefectures in Hubei, Hunan, and Jilin. ", "4 \ncommunity consultations, women's involvement, and incorporation of children\u2019s needs, in the \ndesign and implementation of RWSS projects and programs.  \n \n13.  The principal outputs will be (i) a RWSS sector profile, in accordance with ADB\u2019s format \nand  standards;  and  (ii)  a  RWSS  medium-term  (2006-2010)  sector  development  plan,  for \nincorporation in the 11th FYP. The plan will contain recommended investment projects, a \ncapacity-building program, a research and development program (if appropriate), and a RWSS \nsector road map; and (iii) in the context of realizing the MDGs, a RWSS long-term (2006-2015) \noutline strategy. The plan and the strategy will include recommendations for RWSS monitoring \nand evaluation systems and outline frameworks to disseminate information these generate. The \noutputs will provide the Government with a framework to guide and improve policymaking, \ncoordination, investment, and implementation of RWSS. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will be implemented over seven months, starting March 2004, with key findings \nand recommendations to feed into national policy dialogue toward final drafting of the 11th FYP \n(2006-2010)  in  March  2005.  The  TA  will  comprise  (i)  a  sector  review  to  identify  sector \nconstraints; (ii) an analysis of the constraints and selected case studies; and (iii) preparation of \nsector policies and strategies, an investment plan, priority programs, and external assistance. \nNational and provincial workshops will be convened as required. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $505,000, comprising $214,000 in foreign \nexchange and $291,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested a TA \ngrant in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to meet the total foreign exchange \ncost and part of the local currency amounting to $186,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed \nfrom the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. The remaining portion of the local currency cost \nwill be financed by the Government through the provision of counterparts, office facilities, and \nlogistical support. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Department of Disease Control of the Ministry of Health will be the Executing \nAgency and will appoint a senior official as the TA director. The National Patriotic Health \nCampaign Committee will act as the TA steering committee to be responsible for coordination \nwith all relevant government agencies. Key stakeholders at all levels will be involved in the TA. \nThe TA\u2019s participatory approach will be enhanced by consultations through the dissemination \nstrategy and several workshops. The TA will liaise with, involve, and continuously consult the \nNational Development and Reform Commission to ensure that the proposed RWSS medium-\nterm (2010-2010) sector development plan is incorporated into the 11th FYP. The TA will be \nimplemented  over  seven  months  to  allow  sufficient  time  for  comprehensive  consultation, \ninvolving preparation of various issues papers, workshops, and agreements on the RWSS \ndevelopment strategy.  \n \n17.  Consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants,  based  on  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. International consultants \nwill render 7 person-months\u2019 service: a water supply and sanitation institutional development \nexpert  (5  person-months) and a public economist (2 person-months). Domestic consulting ", "    5 \nservices will total 26 person-months: water supply development (7 person-months), sanitary \ndevelopment (7 person-months), health education and hygiene promotion (3 person-months), \ncommunity participation (3 person-months), economic and financial analysis (4 person-months), \nand management development (2 person-months). All consultants should have experience in \nworking on poverty reduction studies/projects. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \nTA equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n18.  Within one month following mobilization the consultants will submit an inception report to \ndefine the direction of the study and identify critical sectoral issues for assessment and case \nstudies to be prepared. Within three months after commencement, an interim report will present \na detailed analysis of the key issues and constraints, including the findings from the case \nstudies, strategic opportunities, and proposals. The findings will be presented in a workshop for \nselected stakeholders. The recommendations will be endorsed in a tripartite meeting before \nproceeding to the third part of the TA. Six months after commencement, a draft final report will \nanalyze the sector strategy and policies, institutional arrangements, medium-term investment \nplan and strategy, including a capacity-building and training program, and a longer-term outline \nstrategy. A second tripartite meeting will be held to discuss the draft final report. Incorporating \nthis feedback, the final report will be completed one month after the second tripartite meeting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof the People's
