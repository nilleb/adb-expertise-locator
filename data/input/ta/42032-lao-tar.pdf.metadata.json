INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) considers the private \nsector as the engine of growth and industrial development. A main objective of the country\u2019s \nprivate  sector  and  industrial  development  efforts  is  to  attract  sustainable  foreign  and  local \ninvestments. Building upon its small and medium enterprises (SME) strategy and investment laws \nand regulations, the Government seeks to establish special economic zones (SEZs)1 to mobilize \nsubstantive foreign and domestic investments in non-resource-based sectors. The Government \nrecognizes that by offering the necessary infrastructure and services in strategic geographic areas \nfor manufacturing and industry, SEZs can attract foreign investment, spur employment, boost the \ndevelopment of new technologies, diversify the economic base, and enhance entrepreneurial and \ntechnical capacities.  \n \n2.  The  Government  requested  the  United  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization \n(UNIDO) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to develop its SEZ \nin September 2007. This TA paper was developed by a team from the Special Economic Zone \nAuthority (SEZA) of the prime minister\u2019s office of Lao PDR, ADB Lao Resident Mission and \nUNIDO. The TA\u2019s project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In  light  of  the  recent  trends  in  global  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI),  attracting  and \npromoting FDI is a highly competitive venture (particularly among least developed countries), with \ncountries, provinces, municipalities, special economic areas, and other actors often competing for \nthe same FDI market. As Lao PDR is in transition from a landlocked to a land-linked country, it is \nfacing a number of challenges in attracting FDI for industrial manufacturing, assembling, and \nprocessing operations. Despite its efforts to attract foreign and local investment for manufacturing \nindustry, the results have been limited. The country\u2019s location, underdeveloped infrastructure, and \nweak  technical  and  human  resource  capacity  are  among  the  hurdles  for  investors.  The \ndevelopment  of  SEZs  is  expected  to  offer  a  competitive  environment  for  investors  with  the \nprovision  of  land,  basic  infrastructure  and  facilities,  and  an  adequate  legal  and  regulatory \nframework.  \n \n4.  The rapid growth of SEZs over the past three decades in many countries has been made \npossible  by  necessary  reforms.  In  developing  countries,  one  of  the  success  stories  of  SEZ \noperation is the Shenzhen SEZ in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Other successful endeavors \noperate in Brazil, Iran, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Poland, Russian Federation, Senegal, and \nUkraine. Bangladesh and India\u2019s experiences have been mixed. In Asia, the growth of SEZs has \nbeen significant, jumping from about 95 in 1997 to about 135 in 2007, generating a total of about \n$20 billion in exports and directly creating about 10 million jobs. Specific types and approaches of \nSEZs have also evolved over the past two decades in East Asia, with some successful examples \nin Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. In addition, Cambodia is developing \nthe Sihanoukville SEZ. Experiences in the region show that a well-designed and managed SEZ \ncan  have  a  significant  impact  on  a  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  development,  including \ncreating jobs, improving technologies, and building technical and human capacities.  \n \n                                                 \n1  SEZs are delimited geographic locations where basic infrastructure is provided for industrial plants and facilities, and \nspecial provisions, including legislative and financial benefits, are accorded to firms (usually foreign) to attract capital \ninvestments in these selected locations. SEZs vary in types and include export processing zones, free ports, free \ntrade zones, industrial estates, technology parks, and urban enterprises zones.  \n2   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 April 2008. ", " 2   \n \n  \n5.  The  establishment  and  implementation  of  an  appropriate  framework  based  on  good \npractices and standards is critical. While there is a temptation to attract investment by offering \nspecial financial incentives rather than building underlying competitive conditions, it should be \nnoted  that  these  approaches  have  the  potential  to  distort  national  fiscal  policy  and  hurt \nenvironmental and labor standards. An SEZ initiative should be structured to include incentives \nthat are consistent with an overall strategy to promote private sector-led growth and adequately \naddress labor, social, and environmental safeguards.  \n \n6.  Regional good practices and lessons learned suggest that SEZ development in Lao PDR \ncould help promote private investment-led economic growth and accelerate the implementation of \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda. To attain these goals, SEZ development should be part of the \nGovernment\u2019s comprehensive nationwide reform program and its success would be a test-case \nfor liberalizing reforms and the development of best practices in promoting foreign investments \nnationwide. A cross-country review of SEZ experiences would help Lao PDR to adopt the most \nappropriate approach to its own situation. \n \n7.  The Government of Lao PDR introduced the SEZ initiative in 2003 with the adoption of the \nprime minister\u2019s consolidated decrees on the Savan\u2013Seno SEZ, located along the East\u2013West \nEconomic  Corridor.  The  2003  decrees  provided  an  overall  framework  for  establishing  and \nmanaging SEZs, while taking into account the importance of the private sector and the need to \nenhance foreign investment, promote exports, and develop the strategic subregional economic \ncorridors. However, the decrees did not provide the adequate legal and regulatory framework for \nSEZ development.  \n \n8.  Notwithstanding the Government\u2019s strong commitment to SEZ, the progress achieved so \nfar has been minimal and opportunities are being missed due to suboptimal investment inflows. \nKey challenges facing Lao PDR in moving its SEZ initiatives forward include: (i) the lack of a \nnational strategic road map for guiding the country to pursue SEZ development; (ii) an unclear \ninstitutional framework among central agencies and between central and provincial authorities; (iii) \na weak legal framework and the absence of regulatory guidelines; (iv)  insufficient technically-\nqualified officials for SEZ management, investment analyses, and negotiations with investors; and \n(v) the absence of information dissemination and SEZ promotion targeting potential investors and \nbeneficiaries. Recent assessments3 suggest that while SEZ development in Lao PDR is viable, \nthe current SEZ infrastructure arrangements and human resource capacities are not sufficient to \nachieve the desired results. Lessons from a number of ADB\u2019s private sector interventions in trade \nand  investment  enhancement  in  Lao  PDR  and  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)4 \ndemonstrate  the  importance  of  a  clear  strategic  direction,  legal  framework,  and  institutional \nregulations to guide activities that will ensure sustained trade and investment flows.5  \n                                                 \n3  See Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand. 2006.

Lao PDR will need to deploy officials with relevant \nknowledge and skills; strengthen policy and legal and institutional arrangements for investment; and organize an \noperational and well-equipped resource information center to be able to respond quickly and effectively to emerging \nopportunities and challenges. In addition, a strategic road map will need to be formulated to guide investments to Lao ", "    3 \n \n \n9.  The Government is committed to addressing key challenges at the highest level, as was \nevident by the deputy prime minister\u2019s statement at the Lao business symposium in February \n2008 and the planning and investment minister\u2019s statement at the GMS business forum in March \n2008. To enable the Government to meet its commitment, it is critically important to strengthen \npolicy, legal, institutional, and human resource capacities to develop, manage, negotiate, and \npromote SEZs. \n \n10.  To realize its SEZ objectives, the Government requested ADB and UNIDO to assist Lao \nPDR in establishing the fundamentals for developing SEZs. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \nfor  Lao  PDR,  2007\u201320116  specifies  sustainable  economic  growth  through  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  regional  cooperation  as  core  areas  of  ADB  support.  In  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  strategy,  ADB  approved  its  private \nsector development program for Lao PDR in 2007. UNIDO\u2019s Integrated Programme Phase II \n(2004\u20132008)  stipulates  that  the  focus  of  private  sector-led  development  should  be  on \nstrengthening  local  capacities  in  Lao  PDR.  UNIDO  has  provided  assistance  to  many  of  its \nmember countries in developing and implementing SEZs. In cooperation with ADB, UNIDO\u2019s \nglobal  experience  will  be  used  for  providing  the  knowledge  and  good  practices  of  SEZ \ndevelopment in Lao PDR. Close collaboration with other development partners\u2014including Japan, \nthe  International  Finance  Corporation,  and  the  chambers  of  commerce  and  industries  of \nneighboring countries\u2014will also be fostered.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The objective of the TA is to support Lao PDR to increase private investments that will \nhelp sustain the current high levels of economic growth. The intended outcome of the TA is \nenhanced national capacity to develop, manage, negotiate, and promote SEZs in Lao PDR. The \nTA will be a critical precursor to Lao PDR\u2019s future SEZ development. The main outputs will \ninclude the following: (i) improved policy, legal and regulatory framework for SEZ; (ii) improved \nSEZ management and institutional capacity; (iii) target production-chain business opportunities \nidentified;  and  (iv)  an  investment  promotion  network  established  and  promotional  activities \nconducted. The key results of the TA\u2019s core activities and outputs are outlined in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA formulation process adopted a participatory approach, including an extensive \nconsultative process within ADB and among the prime minister\u2019s office, Ministry of Industry and \nCommerce  (MOIC),  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI),  Office  of  the  Governor  of \nSavannakhet province, UNIDO, other development partners, potential investors, and sectoral and \nprovincial focal points and businesses. This collaborative arrangement is expected to continue \nduring project implementation to foster strong client ownership, and will also provide learning-by-\ndoing opportunities for government counterpart staff.  \n13.  TA implementation will be in two phases\u2014the first phase will undertake a strengths, \nweaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis on the feasibility of SEZs in Lao PDR. \nThe SWOT analysis will include a review of the economic viability of SEZs in Lao PDR and will \n                                                                                                                                                             \nPDR. This road map will help in planning priorities, optimizing investment benefits, and in the sequencing of legal and \npolicy reforms needed to open up markets in support of multilateral and bilateral commitments. \n6 ADB. 2006.

It will also assess the current policy, legal, \nand institutional arrangements; human resource capacity; and coordination arrangements for \ninvestments;  and  will  determine  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  existing  framework. \nImplementation of other TA activities will depend on the outcomes of the strengths, weaknesses, \nopportunities, and threats analysis, and on consultations with stakeholders through a workshop.  \n \n14.  A national workshop will be convened to deliberate on the findings of the SWOT analysis \nand to determine whether or not to proceed with other activities of the TA. Should there be \nconsensus to pursue other TA activities; the next phase of the TA will include the drafting of a \nnational SEZ strategic road map to be prepared in alignment with the national SME development \nprogram and relevant GMS trade and investment operations. The roadmap will set out how Lao \nPDR  can  maximize  socioeconomic  development  through  the  efficient  establishment  of  SEZ \nactivities and programs. The national SEZ road map  will support the implementation of the \nSEDP6 and subsequent national and subregional development efforts. Draft SEZ guidelines will \nbe  prepared  on  how  the  SEZA  will  coordinate  with  investors,  developers,  businesses,  and \nintergovernmental  focal  points  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels;  and  with  chambers  of \ncommerce, and investment focal points of other countries. The SEZ guidelines will outline the \nproposed procedures, roles, responsibilities, and accountability mechanisms that will serve as Lao \nPDR\u2019s management, promotion, and negotiation operational manual for SEZ development. \n \n15.  The TA will also assist in planning and establishing the SEZ resource center in SEZA. This \nwill  include  providing  office  furniture  and  fixtures,  computer  equipment,  assistance  for  the \ncataloguing of SEZ documentation; and establishing databases and a website for the SEZ. When \nthe  resource  center  has  been  equipped  with  facilities  and  the  SEZ  guidelines  have  been \nprepared, an electronic network system will be established in SEZA. The electronic network will \nbe linked to the SEZ guidelines and will serve as its operating system and as a peer learning \nnetwork in cooperation with neighboring countries.  \n \n16.  Capacity-building programs will be implemented based on needs assessment. It will focus \non the skills development necessary to effectively implement the Lao PDR\u2019s strategic SEZ road \nmap  and  operational  guidelines.  Other  capacity-building  activities  will  include  tailor-made \ncomputer  and  English  language  training  programs,  website  uploading  and  maintenance, \nelectronic  networking,  cataloguing  and  information  management,  and  key  investment  related \nissues.  \n \n17.  The TA will have eight main activities, including: (i) stocktaking of strengths, weaknesses, \nopportunities, and threats with respect to the feasibility of SEZs for Lao PDR, and assessing the \nexisting SEZ-related policies, and legal, regulatory, and institutional collaboration arrangements; \n(ii) arranging workshops and seminars to discuss lessons from neighboring countries and the \nmost appropriate approach for Lao PDR; (iii) preparing a results-oriented national SEZ road map \nto outline a clear medium-term SEZ strategy and implementation plan, in consultation with key \nstakeholders, including the private sector and development partners; (iv) reviewing the prime \nminister\u2019s decrees on SEZ and related laws, and drafting a SEZ law; (v) developing a set of SEZ \noperational guidelines and manuals that outline a step-by-step process on the management, \nnegotiation,  and  promotion  of  SEZs;  (vi)  assessing  the  institutional  and  human  resource \ncapacities for SEZ and developing a comprehensive institutional and human resource capacity-\nbuilding program; (vii) identifying potential investment areas and investors based on production \nchain analysis and labor market surveys, and supporting promotional activities, as appropriate; \nand (viii) providing on-the-job training to Government officials on how to develop, manage, and \npromote SEZs; conduct investment analyses; and effectively negotiate with potential investors. \n ", "    5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $950,000 equivalent. The TA will be supported \nby parallel cofinancing from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($700,000) and UNIDO \n($150,000)  to  cover  foreign  and  local  currency  costs,  and  by  the  Government  ($100,000 \nequivalent)  through  in-kind  assistance  to  cover  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff, \nadministrative  and  logistic  support,  and  other  required  services.  The  TA  cost  estimate  and \nfinancing plan is in Appendix 2. The use of TA funds will finance the items outlined in Appendix 2, \nwith  both  ADB  and  UNIDO  financing  the  items  outlined  using  their  own  arrangements  and \nguidelines.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  TA  implementation  will  be  in  two  phases\u2014the  first  phase  will  include  a  diagnostic \nassessment of the feasibility of SEZs in Lao PDR. Phase 2 will depend on the findings of phase 1. \nThe TA will be implemented over 24 months from March 2009 to March 2011, and will require the \nservices of a consulting firm to provide: (i) a total of 16 person-months of international consultancy \nservices (intermittent basis) in the areas of SEZ economics, strategy and policy development, and \nproject  financing  for  public-private  partnerships;  SEZ  legal  issues,  operational  manual \npreparation,  and  investment  promotion  and  training;  and  (ii)  a  total  of  62  person-months  of \nnational consultancy services for SEZ law, strategy and policy review; SEZ resource center, \ninformation technology systems development; surveys and promotion activities; SEZ operational \nmanual preparation, and training; and project coordination. The consultants\u2019 outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by UNIDO and ADB in accordance \nwith their respective guidelines on the use of consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nboth organizations. UNIDO will engage individual consultants for resource persons for workshops, \nseminars, conferences, surveys and assessments. ADB\u2019s engagement of consultants will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007 as amended from time to \ntime). The consultant team leader under the guidance of ADB and UNIDO will prepare and submit \n(i) an inception report within 2 weeks of the start of the TA; (ii) a SWOT analysis report within 3 \nmonths  after  the  TA\u2019s  commencement;  (iii)  a  midterm  report  12  months  after  the  TA\u2019s \ncommencement; (iv) activity completion reports at assignment completion, including review and \ndiscussion papers; and (v) a final report at project completion, in addition to various review and \ndiscussion papers, as appropriate. \n \n20.  Equipment and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured using the shopping \nmethod, and in accordance with the respective guidelines of UNIDO and ADB. ADB-financed \nprocurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007 as amended from \ntime to time). At the end of the TA, the procured equipment will belong to the relevant government \nagency using it.  \n \n21.  The SEZA of the prime minister\u2019s office will be the executing agency. As the TA involves \nvarious ministries and agencies, a project steering committee will provide overall guidance for TA \nimplementation  and  issue  the  appropriate  directives  and  decisions.  The  project  steering \ncommittee will be chaired by the minister responsible for economy and industry at the prime \nminister\u2019s office and comprise the vice governor of Savannakhet province, governor of SEZA, and \nrepresentatives from the department of industry of MOIC, department of domestic and foreign \ninvestment of MPI, and the concerned staff of UNIDO and ADB. The project steering committee \nwill meet every 8 months (or as needed) starting from project inception. The vice governor of \nSEZA  will  be  the  project  director  and  will  function  as  the  secretary  for  the  project  steering \ncommittee. SEZA management team, ADB, and UNIDO project task managers will implement the \nproject in collaboration with the Savannakhet provincial planning and investment department, \n ", " 6   \n \n  \nchamber of commerce, and utility providers. A project coordinator will be located at the SEZA to \norganize and supervise the daily activities of the TA. \n \n22.  UNIDO, with the support from its offices in Bangkok and Vientiane, and the ADB Lao \nResident Mission will jointly oversee project implementation and conduct quarterly reviews in \nclose collaboration with SEZA, MOIC, MPI, and the prime minister\u2019s office and Office of the \nGovernor of Savannakhet province. Besides providing financial support, UNIDO and ADB will also \nprovide the technical and managerial expertise to support project implementation, through its own \nstaff  and  external  experts.  As  a  joint  endeavor  between  UNIDO  and  ADB,  implementation \narrangements may be adjusted to facilitate implementation as and where appropriate. Monitoring \nof the implementation progress and TA outcomes will be carried out through periodic reviews of \nTA activities as per the TA framework in Appendix 1.  \n \nIV.
