THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased  loan  to  the  State  Electricity  Corporation  (Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara  [PLN]),  to  be \nguaranteed  by  the  Republic  of  Indonesia,  for  the  Sustainable  Energy  Access  in  Eastern \nIndonesia\u2014Electricity Grid Development Program.1 \n \n  The proposed loan is part of a series of investment programs that aim to enhance access \nto sustainable and modern energy services in Indonesia as envisioned in PLN\u2019s Electricity Power \nSupply Business Plan (Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik [RUPTL]), 2017\u20132026. The \nprogram also addresses a key priority of the Government of Indonesia\u2019s National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional [RPJMN]), 2015\u20132019 \nto stimulate more inclusive growth, with a particular focus on Eastern Indonesia.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n  The role of the energy sector as a key enabler of inclusive growth has become more \nimportant as the Government of Indonesia is faced with the challenge of expanding its economy. \nThe annual rate of growth declined from 6.4% in 2010 to 5.0% in 2016 and is expected to remain \nat 5.1% in 2017. Improved access to affordable and sustainable forms of energy is critical to \nenhance competitiveness, not only in the country\u2019s manufacturing and commercial centers, but \nalso in remote areas. Lack of access to energy constrains efforts to transform the eastern part of \nIndonesia into a new growth engine with a focus on high-value agriculture, fisheries, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, and tourism, all of which rely on a stable energy supply. Uneven \ndevelopment across provinces has contributed toward widening income disparities, with several \nprovinces in Eastern Indonesia lagging significantly behind Java and Bali.3 \n \n  To address this, the government has prioritized accelerating investment in infrastructure \nunder the RPJMN, which explicitly includes the \u201couter\u201d and eastern regions as geographical \npriorities. One of its pillars is to improve access to electricity services significantly by adding 35 \ngigawatts of generation capacity and expanding power grids to raise the national electrification \nratio from 84% in 2014 to 97% by the end of 2019. Eastern Indonesia, where power grids across \nthe islands are isolated, of poor quality, and underdeveloped, presents the greatest challenge to \nthe  achievement  of these  targets. The  electrification ratios  in  some  eastern  provinces  are \nparticularly  low\u201474%  in  West  Sulawesi,  67%  in  Southeast  Sulawesi,  68%  in West  Nusa \nTenggara, 59% in East Nusa Tenggara, and 44% in Papua.4 \n \n  The results-based lending (RBL) program aims to support the development of electricity \ndistribution networks to connect businesses and households and enhance the quality of life in \nEastern Indonesia, while promoting the sustainable use of electricity as a key driver of increased \neconomic activity. The program will complement a proposed sector loan for small to medium-\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The government uses the term \u201cEastern Indonesia\u201d to cover all the provinces in Kalimantan, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara, \nPapua, and Sulawesi. \n3  For example, Jakarta\u2019s 2015 nominal annual per capita income ($14,727) was 13 times higher than that of East Nusa \nTenggara ($1,147). The income gap between the poorest and richest regions has widened since 2010. \n4  PLN Management Reporting Information System (Sistem Informasi Laporan Manajemen [SILM]). \n \n ", "2 \nsized natural gas-fired power stations across Eastern Indonesia.5 Natural gas is a much cleaner \nfuel than diesel, and the quick-responding nature of gas-fired engines and turbines makes them \na good match for intermittent, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.6 It is an \nappropriate transition fuel to move toward a low-carbon energy system. The two loans will help \nenhance access to sustainable energy services, consistent with the Sustainable Development \nGoals (goal 7: affordable and clean energy), and the Paris Agreement on climate change.7 \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n  Overall, the government\u2019s generation, transmission, and distribution program under the \nRPJMN will require $83.5 billion in investments; of this, $43.5 billion is to come from the private \nsector (independent power producers), and the remaining $40.0 billion from PLN.8 PLN is unable \nto provide the entirety of this investment; an estimated funding gap of $30.3 billion will have to be \nborne by other financing sources, including development partners. In Eastern Indonesia, where \nthere are many isolated grids, PLN is already using its own resources to establish 70- and 150-\nkilovolt backbone transmission systems while seeking support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other partners to strengthen and expand local distribution networks.9 \n \n  The government has taken several measures to strengthen PLN\u2019s financial ability to \nundertake this planned expansion, and to improve the investment climate for the private sector. \nThe government increased electricity tariffs in 2014, and instituted automatic price adjustments \non tariffs for all but the poorest households in 2015. Further, the government infused nearly $500 \nmillion in equity to PLN in 2015 and $1.8 billion in 2016. It is also piloting a new subsidy setting \napproach that will rely on performance and incentivize PLN to operate more efficiently in order to \ncapture additional savings. In 2015, the government passed regulations allowing PLN to borrow \ndirectly from bilateral and multilateral agencies against a sovereign-backed guarantee. \n \n  The RBL program will finance a portion of the overall broader program needs as identified \nin PLN\u2019s RUPTL, 2017\u20132026 for strengthening and expanding the power distribution network in \nEastern Indonesia. It builds on the experience and lessons learned from the ongoing RBL \nprogram for grid strengthening in Sumatra.10 The RBL is a suitable modality as (i) it uses PLN\u2019s \nown  systems,  such  that  the  agreed  program  actions  will  directly  contribute  to  institutional \nstrengthening beyond the RBL program\u2019s geographical coverage; (ii) its focus on results rather \nthan  expenditures  will  help  establish  a  stronger  evaluation  culture  complementary  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s intent to provide incentives based on corporate performance; (iii) it helps lower the \ntransaction costs involved in managing thousands of small-scale activities and expenditures to \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016.

The World Bank provides \na $500 million program-for-results (PforR) loan in parallel to ADB\u2019s $600 million program. PLN has fully achieved \nboth the ADB and World Bank 2016 annual disbursement-linked indicators and making progress on all items under \nthe program action plan. \n \n ", "3 \ndevelop the distribution network;11 and (iv) it will enable PLN, government stakeholders, and \ndevelopment partners to convene around achieving the results and outcomes of the program to \nenhance collaboration.12 \n  \n  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  this  program\u2019s  design  include  (i)  strengthening  institutional \ncapacity and addressing bottlenecks to help make PLN\u2019s operations safer and more sustainable,  \n(ii) keeping technical power losses low by emphasizing the number of distribution transformers,13 \n(iii) introducing technological innovations that can optimize resources and contribute to climate \nchange mitigation, and (iv) supporting PLN\u2019s efforts to scale up the adoption of new energy meters \nwhile educating consumers on their energy expenditures. In particular, the program\u2019s incentives \nfor improved waste management will achieve a breakthrough for all regions where PLN operates, \nand the smart grid pilot projects will allow for a higher mix of renewable energy to support the \ncountry\u2019s transition toward more environmentally sustainable growth.14 \n \n  This operation is consistent with the priorities outlined in ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy,  2016\u20132019  for  Indonesia 15  which  has  a  strong  focus  on  the  energy  sector \n(approximately $1 billion per year), and is part of an overall programmatic approach embedded \nwithin a policy reform framework supported by the Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program \npolicy-based loan.16 It will complement the proposed loan for power generation and a further loan \nto develop the power distribution network in Eastern Indonesia. It has been coordinated with the \nkey development partners supporting Indonesia\u2019s energy sector.17 \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n  PLN and ADB have agreed on a RBL program size of $1,830 million dedicated to the eight \nprovinces across Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi,18 of which the proposed loan will finance $600 \nmillion. Table 1 summarizes the RBL program scope. \n \nTable 1: Program Scope \nItem  Broader PLN Program  Results-Based Lending Program \nOutcome  Enhanced energy security  Enhanced access to more reliable \nelectricity services for residential, \ncommercial, and industrial customers \n                                                \n11 The most recent loan for power distribution (Loan 2619-INO: Java\u2013Bali Electricity Distribution Performance \nImprovement Project) experienced significant delays due to rebidding and contractor underperformance. It applied a \n\u201cring-fenced\u201d procurement approach typical for ADB loans, and consolidated contracts into large packages to ease \nadministration. However, the approach effectively excluded the smaller contractors that normally carry out distribution \ncontracts and did not take advantage of PLN\u2019s own system for mid- and low-voltage grid development.  \n12 Additional development partners are currently considering possible parallel cofinancing for this RBL program. \n13 The RUPTL targets are based on total transformer capacity which allows the regional operational teams to use larger \ntransformers at longer intervals, leading to higher losses from extended low-voltage lines. \n14 In line with the government\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions submitted to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n15 ADB. 2016.

Program Results \n \n  The RBL program\u2019s impact, which is aligned with the RUPTL goal, will be the quality of life \nin Indonesian society enhanced by the sustainable use of electricity as a key driver of increased \neconomic activity. The outcome will be expanded access to more reliable electricity services for \nresidential, commercial, and industrial customers in the Eastern Indonesian provinces across \nSulawesi and Nusa Tenggara. This will be achieved through the following two outputs: \n(i)  Output 1. Distribution system strengthened and expanded. This output will \nhelp address the need for an expanded and strengthened distribution system, and \nconsequently  improve  electrification  rates,  reduce  overloading,  and  address \nreliability issues for the local population and businesses. \n(ii)  Output 2. Innovation and institutional capacity enhanced. This output will \nsupport  PLN\u2019s  efforts  to  innovate  and  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for \nenvironmental management and increased efficiency. The program will (a) support \ninnovation  through  pilot-scale  smart  grid  projects,  which  will  integrate  the \nexpanded  use  of  intermittent, renewable  energy  sources  and  better manage \ndemand fluctuation;19 (b) expand the use of digital prepaid meters to reduce \nnontechnical losses, payment defaults, and servicing costs in remote areas; (c) \nimprove PLN\u2019s asset and waste management with the safe disposal of several \nyears\u2019 backlog of used equipment, including hazardous waste; and (d) track the \ntimely implementation of distribution system contracts. \n \n  The conclusions of the results chain analysis and the disbursement-linked indicators \n(DLIs)20 show that these two outputs are sufficient to achieve the outcome. The outcome is \nmeasured by three DLIs: DLI 1 and DLI 2 measure the expanded access to electricity (customers \n[DLI 1] and energy sales [DLI 2]), while DLI 3 measures the reliability of the electricity supply. To \nachieve this outcome, physical components (output 1) as well as institutional improvements \n(output 2) are needed. Thus, progress toward output 1 is tracked by DLI 4 (distribution transformer \nunits installed) and DLI 5 (mid-voltage lines installed). Progress toward output 2 is measured by \nDLI 6 (pilot smart grid projects implemented), DLI 7 (use of digital prepaid meters increased), and \nDLI 8 (asset and waste management improved). \n \n  Overall, the DLIs and other performance indicators provide ambitious yet achievable \nmeasures of progress toward the program outputs and outcome. The DLI targets have been \ndeveloped in consultation with experienced system planners in PLN and are as close as possible \n                                                \n19 The smart grid pilot projects will be aligned to support planned investments in solar and wind energy by both PLN \nand the private sector. Some of these renewable energy investments may be financed by KfW (1,000 Islands \nRenewable Energy for Electrification Program) and ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. \n20 Program Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nto the government-driven RUPTL targets, while carefully considering PLN\u2019s actual performance \nduring 2010\u20132016. \n \n  All indicators are in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) and the program \nresults framework. Table 2 summarizes the disbursement allocations. The largest allocation is for \nDLI 1, as this program\u2019s main objective is to enhance people\u2019s access to electricity services. DLIs \n2 and 5 include subtargets for commercial customers and specific PLN service areas to ensure \nsynergy between the RBL program and the government\u2019s tourism development program in \nEastern Indonesia.21 The results chain also includes some targets articulating the RBL program\u2019s \noutcome, which are difficult to link to disbursements and are therefore included in the program \naction plan (PAP),22 which will be monitored regularly. \n \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nShare of \nDisbursement  Total ADB \nAllocated  Financing \nIndicator  ($ million)  (%) \nOutcome     \nDLI 1 Expanded access to electricity services: Number of total customers in  120.0  20.0 \nSulawesi and Nusa Tenggara increased by an average annual rate of at least     \n5.6% (at least 1.37 million more customers by 2020 from the 2016 baseline)     \nDLI 2 Growth in delivered electricity services: Total annual electricity sales  96.0  16.0 \nincreased by an average annual rate of at least 8.5% (an increase of at least     \n4,374 gigawatt-hours by 2020 from the 2016 baseline), with an equal or     \nhigher growth rate for commercial customers     \nDLI 3 Improved reliability of services: Feeder line permanent interruptionsa in the  48.0  8.0 \ndistribution system reduced by an average annual rate of at least 5% (a   \nreduction of more than 3.61 interruptions per 100 circuit-kilometers by 2020   \nfrom the 2016 baseline) \nOutputs     \nDistribution system strengthened and expanded     \nDLI 4 Number of distribution transformer units installed increased by an average  96.0  16.0 \nannual rate of at least 5.6% (at least 9,933 more units by 2020 from the 2016     \nbaseline)     \nDLI 5 The length of medium-voltage distribution lines installed increased by an  96.0  16.0 \naverage annual rate of at least 5.6% (at least 11,508 circuit-kilometer     \nincrease by 2020 from the 2016 baseline), with an equal or higher growth rate     \nin Lombok and Flores     \nInnovation and institutional capacity enhanced     \nDLI 6 Pilot-scale smart grid projects implemented in at least four areas by 2021  48.0  8.0 \nDLI 7 Operational efficiency and resource optimization enhanced, with at least 75%  48.0  8.0 \nof total customers using digital prepaid meters or smart meters by 2021 (from     \n48% in 2016)     \nDLI 8 Asset and waste management improved, with 90% of used PLN-owned  48.0  8.0 \nequipment from the 2016 disposal inventory safely disposed of by 2021   \n  Total  600.0  100.0 \nDLI = disbursement-linked indicator, PLN = State Electricity Corporation (Perusahaan Listrik Negara). \na  PLN defines permanent interruptions as those over 5 minutes in duration. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates, PLN management reporting information system, and Electricity Power \nSupply Business Plan (Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik), 2017\u20132026. \n \nE.

The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook (2017,  as  amended from time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the borrower and ADB. Up to 25% of the loan will be made \navailable for advance financing upon loan effectiveness. PLN will submit a withdrawal application \nreporting on the achievement of the DLIs, and disbursement will be made subject to verification \nby an independent verification agent (IVA) in accordance with the agreed DLIs and verification \nprotocols (Appendix 3).23 \n                                                \n23 The IVA arrangement for Sumatra RBL is supported by TA 9113-INO: Strengthening Verification in Results-Based \nPrograms  in  Indonesia\u2019s  Power  Sector  under  the  cluster  technical  assistance  C-TA0013-INO:  Sustainable \nInfrastructure Assistance Program financed by the Government of Australia through the Department of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade and administered by ADB.

Further, advance financing will also be \nallowed to address financing requirements as needed within the RBL policy limits.24 PLN will \nrefund any advance financing amount outstanding if the DLIs are not achieved. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n  Various assessments have identified capacity gaps for implementing the RBL program \n(section III). Based on these assessments, a PAP was developed to enhance PLN\u2019s capacity in \naddition to the three output-level institutional strengthening DLIs. The PAP includes actions in \nspecific  technical  areas,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E),  fiduciary  management,  and \nsafeguards to ensure that the achievement of key program results strengthens PLN systems, thus \nmaking the program results more sustainable. The PAP will focus on implementation capacity, \nwhich will complement physical investments under the program and contribute to its overall efforts \nto increase staff resources and improve institutional monitoring and reporting systems. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  The executing agency will be PLN. PLN\u2019s regional offices (wilayahs) in Nusa Tenggara \nand Sulawesi will implement the program, with overall oversight by PLN headquarters.25 The \nprogram will be implemented from October 2017 to December 2021. \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n  A review of the technical soundness of the program found that the distribution design is \nsimple and straightforward, and generally follows international practice. Overall, PLN\u2019s plan to \ndevelop the power systems in Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi is operationally viable and can be \nexpected to increase service coverage and reliability.26 These conclusions underpin the results \nareas, key actions to be taken, and performance indicators for the sector overall, and the RBL \nprogram in particular. \n \n  The primary program beneficiaries will be the 1.3 million additional households connected \nto the distribution grid. Children will be able to read and study in the evenings, and air quality will \nimprove once fuel lamps are eliminated. People will be able to communicate better and access \ninformation via phones and other devices, and village schools and health centers can benefit from \nlighting and refrigeration for vaccines and health supplies. The program will also expand electricity \naccess to small and medium-sized businesses including in tourism, fisheries, and agro-industry, \nand can contribute to substantial job growth. \n \n                                                \nextend the regional coverage to Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi subject to the Board\u2019s approval of the proposed loan. \nAs is the case between ADB and the World Bank for the Sumatra program, the IVA arrangement for Nusa Tenggara \nand Sulawesi may be shared with other development partners when and where similar verifications are required. \n24 Ceilings are 25% for advance financing and 20% for financing for prior results. The combined outstanding balance \nof advance financing and the amount of financing for prior results should not exceed 30%. \n25 Key PLN divisions in headquarters have developed a good capacity to plan and manage RBL programs due to their \nexperience during 2015\u20132016 with both ADB\u2019s RBL program and the World Bank\u2019s Program-for-Results for Sumatra. \n26 Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n  Although expanding and strengthening the electricity grid has no gender-specific actions, \nwomen will benefit substantially from the program. A reliable and affordable electricity supply will \nreduce the amount of effort spent by women to obtain other fuels. It will also enable women to run \nincome-generating activities from their own homes. Communities will be able to pump and store \nwater, and having well-lit streets will deter crime and enhance safety for girls and women. \n \n  The program will generate incremental benefits that accrue from the additional electricity \nsupply. The program\u2019s economic viability is evaluated using a system approach for the entire PLN \nprogram  in  Nusa  Tenggara  and  Sulawesi,  as  the  benefits  are  dependent  on  interlinked \ninvestments in generation, transmission, and distribution. Following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, the economic analysis of the program yields an economic internal \nrate of return of 14.6%, confirming the program\u2019s economic viability (footnote 26). \n  \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n  Monitoring and evaluation systems. PLN\u2019s corporate M&E system is handled and \nmanaged by its Corporate Performance Control Unit using its Management Reporting Information \nSystem (Sistem Informasi Laporan Manajemen [SILM]), which will also be used to track the \nprogress of the DLIs.27 SILM provides accurate, real-time, critical data online, such as electricity-\ngeneration,  sales,  transmission  and  distribution,  and  the  project  development  status.  Each \ndepartment also operates other information technology applications which generate data that \nfeeds into SILM and provide additional information on current activities for PLN\u2019s management. \n \n  A monthly report  provides comprehensive data on customer service quality, project \nperformance, corporate performance, and electricity conditions. The Corporate Performance \nControl Unit, together with the supervising regional division in PLN\u2019s headquarters, holds monthly \nvideoconferences with each wilayah to verify the numbers in SILM. To complement PLN\u2019s internal \nM&E procedures, ADB will engage an IVA to verify information related to DLIs (footnote 23). \n \n  Fiduciary  systems.  The  program  will  use  PLN\u2019s  fiduciary  systems  for  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and audit. These systems were assessed to determine their ability to \nmanage fiduciary risks and provide assurance that RBL program funds will be used as intended, \nwith due consideration for economy and efficiency.28 The assessments found that planning and \nbudgeting improvements are needed, and that further computerization is required for accounting \nand financial reporting. This will be covered by activities under the PAP. \n \n  A procurement assessment covered the following areas: (i) procurement profile; (ii) \nprocurement regulations, rules, and procedures; (iii) procurement organizational arrangements \nand capacity; and (iv) procurement system performance.29 The RBL program will rely on PLN\u2019s \nsystems and will exclude high-value contracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s RBL policy.30 PLN has \nestablished a well-defined and accountable procurement process, and has implemented various \ne-procurement and backend systems. Procurement under the RBL program scope will include \nmaterials for distribution lines; works and service contracts for distribution lines; and engineering, \n                                                \n27 Program Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n28 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Procurement Assessment of Indonesia\u2019s State Electricity Corporation (Perusahaan Listrik Negara) (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 ADB. 2013. Piloting Results-Based Lending for Programs. Manila. High value contracts are those with estimated \nvalue over $50 million for works, turnkey and supply, and installation contracts; $30 million for goods; $20 million for \ninformation technology systems and non-consulting services; and $15 million for consulting services. \n ", "9 \nprocurement, and construction of the pilot smart grid systems. PLN will procure the materials for \ndistribution centrally through limited bidding and framework contracts. The procurement of works \nand installation services will be carried out by PLN wilayahs, including the sub-regional offices \n(areas) under them. Experience from the ongoing RBL in Sumatra shows that this procurement \nprocess is appropriate for power distribution network development. The procurement under the \npilot smart grid projects will be carried out following PLN\u2019s open competitive bidding procedures \nallowing international bidders to participate. \n \n  PLN\u2019s overall procurement risk is assessed as moderate. The main deficiencies and risks \nin PLN\u2019s procurement system are (i) limitations on international bidders who wish to participate, \ndue to requirements for local content; (ii) the use of noncompetitive procurement methods, \nincluding  several  direct  contracting  methods  and  limited  bidding  for  certain  procurement \ncategories; (iii) insufficient procurement capacity or capacity of local contractors to scale up \nprocurement under the program, especially in PLN wilayahs and areas; and (iv) insufficient \nprocurement planning, which may lead to implementation delays. The key procurement risks will \nbe addressed through activities under the PAP. \n \n  The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with PLN. \n \n  Safeguard systems. A program safeguard system assessment assessed the safeguards \nsystem of the government and PLN, and confirmed the safeguards categorizations of B for \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. 31  All  environment  policy \nprinciples, 7 out of 12 involuntary resettlement principles, and 6 out of 9 indigenous peoples \nprinciples of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) are triggered. Potential construction-\nrelated impacts include soil erosion, noise, dust, and waste generation. Potential impacts during \noperation include the trimming of trees within the right-of-way of distribution lines. The program \nimpacts are site-specific and, in most cases, mitigation measures can be readily designed. The \nexpansion of the distribution network usually requires (i) the use of no more than 0.2 square \nmeters of land for each concrete pole, (ii) possible removal of non-land assets (primarily trees) \nfor the stringing of conductors, and (iii) about 4.5 square meters of land for each pole-mounted \ntransformer installed on two utility poles. Some of the land used for the program may be owned \nby indigenous peoples groups. \n \n  Identified weakness in safeguard systems include (i) safeguards screening (of projects in \nprotected areas and key biodiversity areas), (ii) institutional capacity, (iii) monitoring and reporting, \n(iv) guidance on environmental mitigation measures, (v) asset and waste management, (vi) \nconsultations, and (vii) written agreements for land use (for distribution transformers). These will \nbe addressed by program actions, including a screening mechanism to ensure that the RBL \nprogram excludes activities that would be classified as category A. DLI 8 addresses asset and \nwaste management. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.32 The overall benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \n                                                \n31 Program Safeguard Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
