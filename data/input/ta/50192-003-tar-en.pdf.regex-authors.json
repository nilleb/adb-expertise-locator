THE ONGOING PROJECT  \n \n1.  The Supporting Fourth Primary Education Development Program (PEDP4) will support \nBangladesh\u2019s  primary  education  system  covering  all  children  from  pre-primary  to  grade  5 \nnationwide.1 The program builds on the achievements of previous programs with a stronger focus \non strengthening quality of education and enhancing institutional management. The program \naligns with the government\u2019s Seventh Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020.2 The impact of the program \nis strengthened human capital formation. The outcome will be improved quality and equity of \nprimary education for all children from pre-primary to grade 5. The program has three outputs; (i) \nquality  of  primary  education  improved;  (ii)  access  and  participation  to  primary  education \nenhanced; and (iii) governance and management of primary education system improved. The \ntotal cost for the program is $14.7 billion, with $500 million financed by a concessional loan from \nADB. The program was approved in September 2018, and an advance financing of $65 million \nwas disbursed in December 2018. Additional $60 million was disbursed in June 2019 on the \nachievement  of  four  prior  results.3   The  program  is  making  progress  to  achieve  2019 \ndisbursement-linked indicators (DLIs).  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The program will strengthen teaching-learning quality for children to acquire the essential \ngrade level competencies stipulated in the curriculum. It will also improve governance and \nmanagement  of  the  primary  education  system,  which  is  necessary  for  education  quality \nenhancement. To achieve these goals, the following areas need to be strengthened: (i) needs-\nbased Continuous Professional Development (CPD) for in-service teacher development, (ii) \nclassroom  teaching  assessment  system  for  monitoring  teaching  quality,  and  (iii)  education \nmanagement  information  system  (EMIS)  for  monitoring  and  accountability.  The  proposed \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) of $1.2 million, to be financed (on a grant basis) by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), will support implementation of these innovative \ninitiatives  in  the  initial  stage  of  the  program.4 The  TA  activities  include  (i)  supporting  the \noperationalization of  CPD framework (with an integrated component of ICT-based teacher \ntraining), (ii) providing technical support to update classroom observation tool, and (iii) structuring \nthe web-based integrated EMIS and conducting early-stage tests. The proposed scope and scale \nof these activities, including intensive collaboration between ministries and other development \npartners and access to international networks and experts, requires a transaction TA to ensure \nthe successful implementation of the loan program.5 The program and TA align with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030, which calls for improving education.6 \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Output 1: CPD framework operationalization with ICT-based teacher training. The \nTA will support the operationalization of the CPD framework7, which takes a lifelong approach to \ntrain teachers (especially on subject content and pedagogy), by guiding the implementation and \nevaluation of teacher development programs. This includes a study based on a survey of \nteachers\u2019 training needs and assessment of existing training system and capacity. The study will \npropose a plan to operationalize the CPD framework by supporting the incorporation of teacher \nneeds, regular assessments of teachers\u2019 classroom performances, and improving teachers\u2019 \nclassroom  practices  under  upgraded  academic  supervision  to  meet  teacher  competencies \nrequirements.  The study will also support the integration of ICT for teacher training, which is part \nof the structure of CPD framework. Cost-effective options for online learning, including open \nsource course management system such as Moodle, will be considered. The operationalization \nplan will be piloted in selected areas based on needs. The Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) and ADB will closely coordinate in the work related to mathematics subject.
