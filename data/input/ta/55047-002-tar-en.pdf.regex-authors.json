INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aim to support the post-coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) recovery in Mongolia\u2019s primary and secondary education subsectors. It will \n(i) improve teachers\u2019 knowledge and skills to assess students\u2019 learning, (ii) enhance teachers\u2019 \nskills in blended learning methods, (iii) strengthen schools\u2019 management for post-COVID-19 \nrecovery, and (iv) assess the factors affecting learning loss and quality of learning outcomes. \n \n2.  The TA1 is a response to a request from the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) for \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) support for the recovery phase under the Comprehensive Plan \nfor  Learning  Loss  Recovery  in  Primary  and  Secondary  Education,  2021\u20132023,  which  was \ndeveloped by the MES to provide quality and continued education for all groups in Mongolia, \nespecially during the COVID-19 emergency.2 The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational  priorities  for  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  \n(ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity.3 The TA is also aligned with strategic priority 1 of the country partnership strategy for \nMongolia (foster inclusive social development and economic opportunity).4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Background. Because of the rapid spread of COVID-19, the Mongolian Emergency \nCommission temporarily closed all educational institutions and training centers on 27 January \n2020. Classroom teaching at all levels of education institutions shifted to online teaching. The \nadvanced technologies have been used to continue education in the form of distance learning. \nThese measures followed the comprehensive high-level emergency preparedness and public \npreparedness plans implemented by the Government of Mongolia. \n \n4.  Impact  of  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  pandemic  and  prolonged  lockdowns  had \ndevastating impacts on education in Mongolia, which worsened already poor learning outcomes. \nThe MES implemented measures to sustain the quality and accessibility of education services \nduring the lockdown. Online and distance learning were organized through information and \ncommunication technologies throughout the country.5 Overall, children in rural areas received \ndistance education for 100 days, or 20 school weeks (62% of the total academic year coverage), \nand children in the capital city for 110 days, or 22 school weeks (68% of the total academic year \ncoverage) during school closures. Given the exacerbation of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in \nMongolia since May 2021, the minister of the MES and the minister of health issued a joint order \nmandating the use of a blended learning scheme by combining both face-to-face and distance \nlearning approaches at schools. As of 15 September 2021, about 55% of all schools nationwide \nwere using face-to-face learning, 15% were using online-only schemes, and 30% were using \nblended schemes, taking into account the local pandemic situation. The future trend does not \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 October 2021. \n2  Government of Mongolia, MES. 2021.

Information and communication technology gaps and learning loss. Inadequate \ninformation and communication technology infrastructure, especially in remote areas with poor \naccess to electricity and the internet, and lack of sustainable and efficient online and distance \nlearning platforms and resources have adversely impacted the access to and quality of education, \nespecially for the poor. According to the MES and Mongolia Institute of Education Research \n(MIER) survey conducted in March 2021, 92.5% of teachers indicated that students\u2019 learning loss \nwas 40%\u201350%.7 The disruption to education systems has had a particularly huge impact on the \neducation of girls, with a large proportion of them having limited access to distance learning during \nschool closures. Even before COVID-19, about 73% of those children of primary school age who \nwere not in school in Mongolia were girls. This trend is expected to be exacerbated by COVID-\n19.8 \n \n6.  Teachers\u2019  inadequate  capacity  for  blended  learning  and  students\u2019  learning \nassessment. Based on the \u201cAll for Education!\u201d National Civil Society Coalition\u2019s survey, 77.3% \nof teachers  indicated  that  their  workload  was  higher  than  before  the COVID-19  pandemic. \nTeachers were unprepared for online and distance learning. About 73.3% of teachers had never \ntaught distance learning and only 20.0% had electronic devices with knowledge on how to use \nsoftware and applications.9 Improving teachers\u2019 knowledge and skills to implement the curriculum \nhas been a big challenge in the past because existing in-service professional development \nprograms do not assist teachers in adopting a child-centered methodology and the formative and \nsummative assessments and evaluation methods required by the new curriculum.10 Therefore, \nteachers are required to improve their teaching and assessment skills not only in the classroom \nbut also in distance learning using active and blended learning methods. Strengthening teachers\u2019 \nknowledge and skills through providing continuing professional development (CPD) training is a \nmajor strategy to reduce learning losses among students. Teachers need better methodological \nand technical support for online teaching and formative assessment to track student progress in \nlearning and target lagging students. At the same time, school leaders also experienced difficulty \nin managing and administering schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n7.  Strategic alignment and value addition. Recognizing the importance of providing quality \nand continued education for all groups in the country, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, \nthe  MES  developed  the  Comprehensive  Plan  for  Learning  Loss  Recovery  in  Primary  and \nSecondary Education, 2021\u20132023 (footnote 2). The plan has 10 strategies within three objectives \nbased on a three-phase \"3R\" model (reconnection, recovery, and resilience). ADB\u2019s ongoing \nSustaining Access to and Quality of Education During Economic Difficulties Project provided \nextensive support during the development of the plan.11 The reconnection phase has been \n \n6  At the beginning of the academic year 2021\u20132022, the number of infected children accounted for 19.8% of the total \nnumber of confirmed cases. Since the reopening of schools, blended learning has been exercised. The current rate \nof COVID-19 cases among children is less than 20% of total cases, which confirms that the blended learning system \nis an effective way to continue the learning process without worsening the pandemic situation.  \n7  MES and MIER.

The \nMES is requesting ADB\u2019s support for the recovery phase which aims to develop and deliver CPD \nprograms for teachers and school leaders to eliminate learning loss. In the third phase, which is \nthe resilience phase, the MES, with support of other donors, will continue implementing the \nactivities started in the recovery phase.13 As the face-to-face conventional learning scheme is no \nlonger feasible in all schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to strengthen the \ncapacity of school managers and teachers to (i) assess students\u2019 learning achievements and their \nlearning environment, (ii) detect those students who are at risk of dropping out and provide \nsupport to them, (iii) use blended learning schemes, and (iv) create a better learning environment. \nThe TA responds to the expressed needs of the teachers and students in the education sector to \nbe prepared for and benefit from new modes of instruction and learning premised on the use of \nimproved teaching  and management  and  performance  measurement methods in  the  post-\nCOVID-19 environment. \n \n8.  The TA will build on the ongoing ADB Sustaining Access to and Quality of Education \nDuring the Economic Difficulties Project (para.7 and footnote 11) which aims to sustain the access \nto and quality of pre-primary, primary, and secondary education during the economic difficulties \nthat Mongolia has been facing (footnote 11). In addition to increasing the number of seats in \nschools and kindergartens, the project has been supporting the MES to improve the student \nlearning assessment criteria and methods for primary and secondary education; introduce school-\nbased management; and develop and deliver CPD programs for pre-primary, primary, and \nsecondary teachers through online platforms and workshops. This TA project will continue the \ncapacity building of teachers and school managers through the design of CPD programs on \nstudents\u2019 learning assessment, blended learning methods, and school-based management using \nthe Institute of Teachers\u2019 Professional Development (ITPD) online training platform. \n \nIII.
