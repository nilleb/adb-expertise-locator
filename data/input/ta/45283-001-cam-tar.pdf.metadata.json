INTRODUCTION \n1.   Cambodia was selected for the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR), which \naims  to  demonstrate  ways  in  which  climate  risk  and  resilience  can  be  integrated  into \ndevelopment planning. With support from ADB and the World Bank Group, the Government of \nCambodia prepared the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR), comprising seven \ninvestment projects and the proposed technical assistance (TA).1 The government requested \nADB support in implementing all projects, including the TA. The resource envelope for SPCR is \n$385 million, including $86 million from the PPCR and $299 million in cofinancing from ADB and \nother development partners. The PPCR subcommittee endorsed the SPCR in June 2011.  \n \n2.   ADB circulated the draft TA concept paper for comment by government ministries, civil \nsociety organizations, development partners, and other stakeholders, who collectively reached a \nconsensus on the need to strengthen the capacity of key stakeholders to mainstream climate \nresilience into development planning. Following a fact-finding mission from 18 to 24 April 2012, \na memorandum of understanding was signed with the secretaries of state of both the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF) and the Ministry of Environment (MOE) on 3 May 2012, agreeing \non  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost,  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of \nreference for consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Cambodia\u2019s high vulnerability to climate change is attributed to its low adaptive capacity \nand high reliance on climate-sensitive sectors such as water resources and agriculture. The \n2011 floods alone, for example, caused an estimated $451 million in damage and $174 million \nin  losses.  Analysis  of  14  general  circulation  models  suggests  that  onset  of  rainfall  will \ncommence later, wet season rainfall will increase (bringing more flooding), and dry season \nrainfall will decrease (leading to droughts). Finally, Cambodia\u2019s 435-kilometer coastline and \nlarge parts of the Mekong River flood plain may be affected by sea level rise, which is projected \nto make additional areas vulnerable to floods, salinity intrusion, and coastal inundation, with \nadverse implications for food and water security and infrastructure stability. Climate change thus \nposes a serious threat to sustainable development in Cambodia. \n \n4.   Cambodia has shown a strong commitment to addressing climate change by ratifying \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1996 and the Kyoto Protocol \nin 2003. In 1999, the MOE created a Climate Change Office, which became the Climate Change \nDepartment in 2010. In 2006, the government established the National Committee on Climate \nChange (NCCC), comprising high-level representatives from 20 ministries. The Prime Minister \nhas been the honorary chair of the  NCCC since 2009. In October 2006, the government \nformulated  the  National  Adaptation  Program  of  Action  (NAPA),  which  included  39  priority \nadaptation projects in sectors such as agriculture, water resources, coastal zone management, \nand human health. In March 2009, the government launched the Strategic National Action Plan \n(SNAP) for disaster risk reduction (DRR), 2008\u20132013, which covers a number of climate change \nadaptation (CCA) themes. In addition, the government has begun preparing the Cambodian \nClimate Change Strategic Plan to provide a strategic framework for  responding to climate \nchange. \n \n5.   Despite the above progress at policy level, operational planning in sectors such as water \nresources, agriculture, transport, and urban planning does not consider risks associated with \nclimate change. Targeted assistance, combined with initiatives to strengthen mechanisms for \nthe dissemination of climate change information, is needed to overcome various barriers such \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 24 May 2012. \n ", "2   \nas (i) limited awareness of climate change impacts on projects and programs; (ii) inadequate \navailability and access to reliable data, information, and assessments of local vulnerabilities and \nimpacts; (iii) limited institutional capacities; and (iv) limited financial resources. Also, progress \nhas been slow in coordinating adaptation investments, piloting adaptation interventions, and \nscaling up best practices. Despite the recognition that women are disproportionately more \nvulnerable than men to impacts of climate change, efforts to integrate gender perspectives in \nadaptation programs, plans, and policies have been limited.  \n \n6.   The TA supports Cambodia\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and \nEfficiency and the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) update 2009\u20132013, which \nprovides the roadmap for the implementation of the strategy. The rectangular strategy works to \nenhance public institutional capacity, promote good governance, and modernize infrastructure in \norder to foster economic growth, create jobs for all citizens, ensure social equity, increase public \nsector efficiency, and protect natural and cultural resources, which are vital for sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The TA supports the NAPA through feasibility studies for \npriority  projects,  and  the  SNAP  through  enhancing  capacity  to  mainstream  DRR  into \ndevelopment  policies  and  plans.  It  also  supports  the  2010\u20132019  implementation  plans  for \ndecentralization and deconcentration under the National Program for Sub-National Democratic \nDevelopment, which calls for mainstreaming climate change at subnational levels. \n \n7.   The  TA  aligns  with  ADB  Strategy  2020,  the  Southeast  Asia  Department\u2019s  Climate \nChange Implementation Plan, and various sector assessments, strategies, and roadmaps. It \nhas strong synergies with ADB\u2019s Cambodia country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132013, which \nrecognizes the need to increase capacity to (i) mainstream climate change in sector analysis, \nplanning, and project design; (ii) improve approaches to resource conservation in the Tonle Sap \nBasin;  (iii)  coordinate  national  and  subregional  programs  on  climate  change  and  the \nenvironment; and (iv) access finance from internal and external sources to support climate \nchange activities in new and existing projects. The TA provides a framework to support the \nseven ADB investment projects2 related to water resources, agriculture, and infrastructure. The \nTA  aims  to  fulfill  critical  activities,  including  knowledge  generation,  fund  generation  for \nadaptation projects, and coordination, monitoring, and evaluation for all SPCR investments. \n \n8.   The TA strengthens linkages with work being undertaken under phase 1 of the PPCR3 \nand other initiatives, such as the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance4 and the Climate Change \nand Adaptation Initiative. 5 The TA also provides strong links with other proposed ADB projects,6 \nwhich  include  adaptation  activities  and  adaptation  projects  of  other  bilateral  development \npartners,  such  as  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development, and the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit. \n                                                \n2  ADB, 2010.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be enhanced resilience to climate change  in Cambodia,  leading to \nimproved livelihoods, especially for vulnerable groups such as women and children. By 2022, a \n20% reduction from the 2012 baseline is expected in the number of households affected by and \nthe economic losses resulting from extreme climate events. The outcome will be sustained \ninstitutional and technical capacity to integrate adaptation concerns into development planning. \nBy 2018, agreed strategies on adaptation and DRR will be integrated into at least three sectors. \nAlso, at least 25% of projects in water resources, agriculture, transport, and water supply and \nsanitation will be climate-proofed. By the end of the TA, it is expected that (i) risk screening tools \nwill be applied for projects in irrigation, flood prevention, agriculture, biodiversity, roads, water \nsupply and sanitation, and urban development; and (ii) vulnerability assessments incorporating \nclimate information will be performed for projects determined to be at risk in key sectors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  (i)  strengthen  capacity  to  coordinate  all  SPCR  investments  and  to \nmainstream CCA concerns into national and subnational planning, budgeting, and development; \n(ii) conduct feasibility studies for priority projects of the NAPA with a view to securing additional \nfunds from sources such as the Adaptation Fund and the Green Climate Fund; (iii) establish a \ncivil society support mechanism to fund community-based adaptation activities and strengthen \nthe capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to \nmainstream climate resilience into their operations; and (iv) generate and disseminate CCA \nknowledge in various sectors. The TA will promote synergies between CCA and DRR, set up a \ncommon framework for the monitoring and evaluation of all SPCR projects, and develop a \nknowledge and communications plan for each component. \n \n11.   Output  1:  SPCR  coordination,  technical  support,  and  capacity  to  mainstream \nclimate resilience into development planning strengthened. This output will monitor the \nprogress of SPCR projects under a single PPCR results framework to optimize shared learning \nand harmonize the monitoring and evaluation of CCA initiatives. In addition, it will develop tools \nand  guidelines  to  climate-proof  projects  and  incorporate  climate  risk  management  into \noperational policies. The results framework will build on the government\u2019s experience in results-\nbased management and will measure the effectiveness of programs using baseline data and \ntarget indicators, including gender. Emphasis will be given to initiatives that explicitly benefit \nwomen  and  other  marginalized  and  vulnerable  groups.  The  development  of  the  results \nframework will involve all implementing agencies of the SPCR and other CCA initiatives, as well \nas  civil  society  and  development  partners.  The  activities  include  (i)  establishing  a  PPCR \ncoordinating and technical backstopping unit at the MOE;  (ii) assessing the capacity building \nneeds of national and provincial policy makers,  technical staff, and CSOs  with regard to  \nplanning, budgeting, and implementing climate change actions; (iii) organizing training events \nand workshops targeted at key stakeholders, including vulnerable communities, women, and \nyoung  people;  (iv)  conducting  training  on  adaptation  in  the  water  resources,  agriculture, \ntransport,  and  urban  planning  sectors  and  preparing  necessary  guidebooks  manuals  and \nreports; and (v) providing technical support for integrating adaptation concerns into development \nplanning. By TA completion, line ministries and government agencies will be equipped to screen \ndevelopment projects for climate change risks and devise appropriate adaptation measures and \npolicies. \n \n \n \n ", "4   \n12.   Output  2:  Detailed  feasibility  studies  for  selected  NAPA  projects  conducted. \nFeasibility studies for selected NAPA projects, particularly unfunded ones related to the SPCR \ninvestments, will be conducted. NAPA activities that can immediately benefit from global funds \nwill be identified and developed, with preference given to projects employing ecosystem-based \nadaptation  approaches  and  those  that  directly  improve  the  climate  resilience  of  women, \nchildren, and marginalized groups in both rural and urban areas. \n \n13.   Output 3: Civil society support mechanism established, and capacity of NGOs and \nCSOs to mainstream CCA and DRR into their operations strengthened. The mechanism \nwill assist grassroots and local NGOs and CSOs operating in Cambodia to conduct field-based \nstudies and/or implement projects on CCA and DRR. About 20\u201330 grants will be competitively \nawarded to local NGOs to (i) help communities better understand their sources of vulnerability; \n(ii)  generate  knowledge  about  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  potential  civil  society \napproaches to adaptation and DRR; (iii) assess the possibilities of linking the studies to ADB-\nfinanced  projects  to  enable  mainstreaming  of  adaptation;  (iv)  apply  lessons  learned  from \ncommunity-based adaptation and DRR initiatives to the development of additional projects, and \nintegrate these lessons into national adaptation policy and practice; and (v) develop knowledge \nproducts that will serve as a useful resource for the government and development partners to \ninform  policy  development  and  decision  making.  Community-based  projects  that  directly \nimprove  the  climate  resilience  and  livelihood  diversification  of  women,  children,  and \nmarginalized groups in rural and urban areas will be prioritized for grants. \n \n14.   Output 4: CCA knowledge products developed and disseminated. This output will \nestablish a knowledge management system for synthesizing and sharing information on climate \nchange impacts and adaptation measures appropriate to Cambodia by developing links to web \nportals such as the ADB-supported Asia Pacific Adaptation Network7 and the Climate Change \nand Adaptation Initiative. By TA completion, all stakeholder groups, including women and other \ndisadvantaged  groups,  will  have  a  deeper  understanding  of  climate  risks  and  adaptation \noptions. Key activities include (i) developing a communication plan through the synthesis of \ninformation and knowledge from PPCR projects; (ii) conducting awareness raising and multi-\nstakeholder workshops; (iii) updating the educational curriculum on climate risk and resilience; \n(iv) documenting locally relevant and indigenous adaptation practices; (v) creating knowledge \nproducts and appropriate media and content with the assistance of CSOs to communicate \ninformation effectively; and (vi) disseminating PPCR results effectively in national, regional, and \ninternational forums, including PPCR Pilot Country Meetings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $7 million equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby the ADB Strategic Climate Fund8 and administered by ADB. The government will provide \nadditional  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  offices,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented for 5 years from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017. The \nMOE will be the executing agency, with administrative oversight from the MEF and the NCCC. \nImplementing agencies include the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, the Ministry \nof Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the Ministry \nof  Rural  Development,  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  the  Ministry  of  Interior,  and  the  National \nCommittee for Disaster Management. The MOE will chair SPCR coordination team, which will \ninclude senior representatives of the above agencies and other ministries such as the Ministry \n                                                \n7 Asia Pacific Adaptation Network Web Portal. http://www.asiapacificadapt.net/ \n8 Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n ", "  5 \nof Women Affairs. The team will guide SPCR implementation and oversee the PPCR technical \nbackstopping unit, in close cooperation with the entity that manages the civil society support \nmechanism. \n \n17.   The TA will require (i) 105 person-months of international consulting services and 435 \nperson-months of national consulting services to be provided by a consulting firm; (ii) 105 \nperson-months of national consulting services to be recruited individually; and (iii) an NGO with \noperations in Cambodia to operate the civil society support mechanism. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). As climate change consulting expertise is still limited, the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method,  using  the  quality-cost  ratio  of  90:10  and  full  technical \nproposal procedures, will be followed. The NGO selection method will be determined during the \nshortlisting phase. The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. Procurement \nand disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time) and ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (May 2010, as \namended from time to time). Equipment procured for the TA will become the property of the \nexecuting agency (the MOE) upon completion of the TA. \n \n18.   The  contracts  for  consulting  entities  will  only  include  funds  for  consultant  items \n(remuneration and per diem, international and local travel, and reports and communications) as \ndefined in the cost estimates and financing plan (Appendix 2). For expenses related to office \nequipment,  workshops,  training  and  conferences,  administrative  support,  NAPA  feasibility \nstudies, and knowledge products, an advance payment facility (APF) may be used. Funds for \nsuch expenses will be provided as advances to the MOE based on agreed work plans and \nbudgets or approved contracts. The APF will be established at the National Bank of Cambodia, \nand its ceiling and the amount of the initial advance will be based on estimated expenditures for \nthe first 6 months or 10% of the budget to be managed by the MOE, whichever is lower. The \nAPF  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook and arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB.  \n \n19.  With support from consultants, the MOE will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB. \nProgress will be monitored using intended outcomes and outputs described in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). Further, in line with output 4, the dissemination of results \nwill  be  carried  out  through  specified  conferences,  workshops,  and  web  portals  starting  in \nJanuary 2013. The MOE will monitor project progress following the project implementation \nschedule, and will keep ADB informed of any significant deviations from the schedule. Within \nthree months of the TA\u2019s completion, the MOE will submit to ADB a project completion report. \nThe form and content of the reports will be agreed with ADB during the TA inception mission. \n \nIV.
