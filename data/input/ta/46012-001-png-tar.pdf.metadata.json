INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  the  Government  of  Papua  New \nGuinea in implementing its Electricity Industry Policy (EIP)1 by supporting the preparation of the \nnational electrification roll-out plan (EROP), establishing implementation capacity within the \nEnergy Division of the Department of Petroleum and Energy (DPE), and assisting in identifying \nand  implementing  initial  pilot  projects.  The  government  requested  support  for  the  project \nthrough inclusion of the project in the Papua New Guinea (PNG) country partnership strategy, \n2011\u20132015 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 The project impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  were \nagreed with the government during the fact finding mission of 3\u201314 September 2012 and \nincluded in the mission memorandum of understanding. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In PNG, grid-connected power is largely restricted to the main urban areas, giving \napproximately 10% of the population access to electricity. Distributed power is rarely available \noutside urban centers. The supply of power in the main urban centers is often unreliable, with \nregular power outages and demand at times exceeding generation capacity. On the main grids, \npower outages are becoming increasingly frequent because of insufficient generation and poorly \nmaintained transmission and distribution systems. Because of the unreliable power supply, \nthere is considerable self-generation and back-up generation capacity in urban areas, which is \nmaintained  and  operated  at  high  cost  and  low  efficiencies.  Demand  is  expected  to  rise \nsignificantly, fuelled by high economic growth, partially associated with the proposed liquefied \nnatural gas plant near Port Moresby, as well as continued growth in the mining sector and \nassociated industry. Lack of access to affordable, reliable power is limiting economic growth in \nprovincial areas and lack of capacity and poor quality supply is constraining economic growth in \nthe main urban areas.  \n \n3.  PNG has a total of 580 megawatts (MW) of installed generation capacity. PNG Power \nLimited (PPL), the national state-owned corporatized power utility, manages generation of about \n300 MW, including the two main grids (Port Moresby and Ramu) and 19 geographically isolated \nindependent power grids servicing provincial centers. The remaining 280 MW is self-generated \nby industrial facilities, mines, and private sector generators. Power tariffs are independently \nregulated by the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission and allow for full cost-\nrecovery for PPL. The power tariff is uniform across PPL\u2019s customers countrywide, regardless of \nlocal  generation  costs.  This  creates  a  disincentive  for  investment  in  high-cost  rural  and \nprovincial centers. Increased access to and improved quality of supply is hindered by lack of \nsector  planning  and  insufficient  allocation  of  community  service  obligations  (CSOs)  in \nunprofitable areas. Sector policy formulation is managed by the Energy Division of the DPE. \n \n4.  To address the range of sector issues, the government passed the EIP in 2011. The \npolicy is designed to address three strategic objectives of the government: (i) improving access \nin the provision of electricity services, (ii) improving reliability of electricity supply,  and (iii) \nensuring that power is affordable for consumers. \n \n                                                \n1  Papua New Guinea. 2011.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 November 2012.  \n ", "2   \n5.  The EIP supports  \n(i)   delivery of additional CSOs through the national budget to increase access to \nenergy;  \n(ii)   engagement of the private sector for delivery of CSOs;  \n(iii)   allowance for variable tariff structures depending on generation costs;  \n(iv)   retaining  transmission  within  government  ownership  but  encouraging  private \nsector ownership of generation, distribution, and retail assets; and  \n(v)   transfer of technical regulation from PPL to the DPE.  \n \n6.  To implement the EIP, the following measures are proposed: establishment of a high-\nlevel electricity management committee to oversee implementation of the EIP, development of a \nnational EROP to advise on priority investments, and establishment of an electricity trust fund to \nchannel allocation of funding from the national budget.  \n \n7.  The  government  has  recognized  that  implementation  of  the  EIP  is  an  ambitious \nundertaking  and  that  significant  support  is  required  for  successful  implementation. \nImplementation  of  the  EIP  is  the  responsibility  of  the  DPE,  however  the  department  has \ninsufficient capacity for this mandate. The government has a structured plan for expanding the \nDPE in order to implement the EIP, however it recognizes the significant capacity building \nrequired. As a result, the government has requested TA from ADB to support implementation. \nThe government has also requested World Bank assistance in implementing the EIP, and ADB \nis coordinating closely with the World Bank. The government has requested that ADB support \nimplementation of the EIP through  \n(i)   support for preparing the EROP, including developing transparent procedures for \nprioritization of projects identified under the roll-out plan, and calculation of CSO \nrequirements; \n(ii)   developing capacity within the DPE, including procurement capacity and project \nmanagement  capacity  (including  project  identification,  implementation \nmanagement, monitoring, and reporting procedures); and  \n(iii)   support for identification and preparation of the first pilot project to trial the project \nimplementation mechanism envisaged under the EIP.  \n \n8.  The TA is in line with the PNG country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 (footnote 2), \nwhich prioritizes energy as a key area of support; and the PNG Development Strategic Plan, \n2010\u20132030 priority of extending electricity access and improving power supply.4 The TA directly \nsupports implementation of key components of the EIP. Effective implementation of the EIP will \nsupport ADB\u2019s ongoing energy sector lending and grant program to PNG, consisting of the \nTown Electrification Investment Program,5 and the proposed Port Moresby Grid Development \nProject. \n \n9.  There are a number of initiatives supporting policy reform in the PNG power sector. ADB \nsupported the preparation of a sector plan in 2009,6 which the government intends to use as the \ntechnical  basis  of  the  EROP.  The  World  Bank  is  proposing  TA  loan  support  (for  Board \nconsideration in 2012) to draft a rural electrification policy and a renewable energy policy. These \n                                                \n4  Government of PNG, Department of National Planning and Monitoring. 2010. Papua New Guinea Development \nStrategic Plan, 2010\u20132030.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be improved quality of and increased access to electricity \nservices. The outcome will be that the DPE implements the EROP.  \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will support the planning for implementation of the EIP through preparation of the \nEROP, capacity building within the DPE, and assistance with identifying and implementing pilot \nprojects. The outputs of the project are as follows:  \n(i)  DPE prepares the electrification roll-out plan. The TA will assist the DPE with \npreparation  of  the  EROP.  This  will  include  assistance  to  prepare  targeted \ntechnical sections of the plan. This activity will follow the development of an \nimplementation strategy to be coordinated by the DPE with the joint support of \nADB and the World Bank. The TA will also assist in developing transparent \nprocedures  for  prioritizing  projects  identified  under  the  EROP,  including \ncalculating CSO requirements. \n(ii)  DPE has capacity to implement the electrification roll-out plan. The TA will build \ncapacity within the DPE to implement the EIP,7 including procurement capacity \nand project management capacity. This will include provision of international \ntechnical experts who will provide one-on-one training, workshop training, and \nassistance with preparing operational guidelines such as procurement guidelines \nand  procedures  for  project  identification,  implementation  management,  and \nmonitoring and reporting. \n(iii)  DPE implements one pilot project. The TA will help identify and prepare the first \nproject for trialing the proposed project implementation mechanism envisaged \nunder the EIP.8 \n \n12.  Major assumptions are that (i) the government commitment to the process outlined in the \napproved EIP will continue, including allocation of sufficient CSO for implementation of the EIP; \n(ii) CSO budget is available in a timely manner; and (iii) sufficient staff are transferred to the \nDPE to implement the EROP. A major risk with implementation of the EIP is that the private \nsector will be unwilling to undertake significant investment in the sector.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n7  Not including transfer of technical regulation from PPL. \n8  This output will trial the project selection and implementation mechanism designed under the project. The actual \nproject for selection will depend on the process of project prioritization which will be developed under the technical \nassistance. The trial project will include private sector involvement with a rural-based renewable energy project. \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The DPE will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will finance consulting services, \nequipment, and office furnishings to support DPE implementation of the outputs. A total of 21 \nperson-months of international consultants and 12 person-months of national consultants will be \nrequired, to be hired through a consulting firm. The following expertise will be required: a \ngovernance  specialist,  a  power  infrastructure  specialist  (international  and  national),  a \nprocurement specialist, and a private sector specialist. Consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) \nthrough quality- and cost-based selection (quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10)9 using simplified technical \nproposal. Consultants may also be recruited through individual consultant selection (considered \njustified due to difficulties in finding consulting companies with the broad technical spread of \nrequired specialists on staff, and the limited pool of consultants with required technical and \ncountry expertise). A project steering committee will oversee implementation. The committee \nwill meet at least quarterly and will be chaired by the DPE. The TA will commence on 21 \nDecember 2012 and will be completed on 24 December 2015. \n \n15.  Equipment under the TA will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, \nas amended from time to time). Training and workshops will be implemented with the assistance \nof consultants. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The equipment procured under \nthe TA will be turned over to the executing agency upon TA completion. The government will \nprovide  in-kind  counterpart  costs  and  services  including  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \nadministrative support costs, and local city transport and logistics costs. The DPE, supported by \nthe consulting company, will provide quarterly reports to ADB. Twice-yearly review missions will \nbe undertaken by ADB. Additional monitoring will be undertaken by national ADB staff based in \nthe Papua New Guinea Resident Mission.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Papua New Guinea for Implementation of the Electricity Industry Policy, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n9  The quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 is justified because of the technical complexity of substation design and power grid \ndesign.   \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance \nTargets and  Data Sources and   \n  Indicatorsa with  Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Baselinesb  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved quality and  Access to electricity  National Economic  Government allocates sufficient \nincreased access to  increases by 5% of  Report  CSO budget  \nelectricity services  total population in   \ntarget province by  Risk \nJanuary 2016  Private sector unwilling to invest in \ncompared to January  PNG power sector  \n2013c \nOutcome      Assumptions \nDPE implements the  Increased private  Quarterly electricity  CSO funds become available in a \nEROP  sector investment in  management  timely manner \nat least one  committee (EMC)   \nadditional power  board reports  Sufficient staff are assigned to DPE \ngeneration asset  to implement the EROP \nbetween January   \n2013 and January  Pilot projects are implemented in a \n2016    timely manner \n   \nDisbursement of $2  Risk \nmillion CSO  Political pressure influences site \nfinancing to  selection \nelectrification \nprojects by January \n2016 \nOutputs       Risks \n       \n1.
