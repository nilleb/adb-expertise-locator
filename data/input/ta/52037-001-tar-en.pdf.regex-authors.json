INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Pacific developing \nmember countries (DMCs) with ongoing or planned Asian Development Bank (ADB) health sector \noperations in (i) undertaking relevant prefeasibility work and assessments of critical health issues, \nincluding  health  impact  assessments  and  cross-sectoral  support;  and  (ii)  identifying  and \nreplicating innovative and evidence-based approaches for developing and managing health \nservices in the Pacific.1  \n \n2.  This TA is aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to address \nremaining poverty and reduce inequalities; the Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u22122020 to support \nuniversal health coverage; and the Pacific Approach, 2016\u22122020 strategic framework to improve \nhealth and health services.2 The TA will contribute to the Pacific region\u2019s own Healthy Islands \nvision3 and Sustainable Development Goal 3 by promoting reproductive, maternal, newborn, and \nchild health; preventing infectious and noncommunicable diseases; and strengthening systems in \nregions with the highest disease burdens.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Pacific health burden. Noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of death in \nmost Pacific DMCs. They contribute to 28% of premature deaths in Solomon Islands and Papua \nNew Guinea and up to 51% in the Cook Islands, significantly higher than the 13% global average.5 \nSeven of the top 10 diabetes-prevalent countries in the world are in the Pacific, with Nauru and \nTuvalu ranked at the top.6 Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in most Pacific DMCs \nbehind ischemic heart diseases and stroke, with cervical, oral, liver, and uterine cancer-related \ndeaths rising.7 The Pacific is also the only region in the world where the number of underweight \nchildren has increased since 1998.8 Poor health contributes to labor productivity losses, reduced \neducational outcomes, and poverty.   \n \n4.  Fragile health systems in the Pacific. The Pacific DMCs comprise more than 12.4 \nmillion people spread across about 25,000 islands in 14 countries.9 There are many differences \nin economic growth and development in the health sector, with the percentage of gross domestic \nproduct spent on health ranging from 4.5% in Fiji to 19.7% in Tuvalu.10 The following limit the \nprovision  of  basic  health  services  to  island  communities:  geography,  transport,  financial \n                                                \n1  ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs with ongoing health sector investments are Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga with \noperations planned for the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n2  ADB. 2018.

Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. \nManila. Because ADB developed the TA subsequent to the current Pacific Regional Operations Business Plan and \nadoption of the 2018 departmental work program it is not included in either. Pursuant to the staff instruction on \nbusiness processes for knowledge and support TA, the ADB Vice-President for Operations 2 approved the TA \nconcept paper on 11 September 2018. \n3  Secretariat of the Pacific Community. 1995. Yanuca Declaration: Healthy Islands Vision. (Noumea). The Pacific \nhealth ministers adopted the Healthy Islands vision, which outlines the island communities\u2019 challenges in fighting \nnoncommunicable and infectious diseases and regional security. \n4  United Nations. 2015.

These factors also contribute to \nsignificant disparities in health outcomes and unmet needs.11  \n \n5.  Gaps in health financing. Most Pacific DMCs provide health services free of charge, but \nout-of-pocket health expenditures are increasing (e.g., these expenses are estimated to account \nfor 35% of the total health expenditure in Fiji and Vanuatu).12 Because of the lack of appropriate \ninfrastructure and services, medical evacuation is a common feature in all Pacific DMCs, utilizing \na disproportionate percentage of public health financing to benefit just a small fraction of the \npopulation.13 Overcrowding in national hospitals for basic primary care services is driving up \ninefficiencies and health care costs. The level of health spending is unlikely to be sufficient to \naddress future challenges, with the rising disease burdens and the Pacific DMCs still being \ndependent on development partner funding particularly for core public health functions (e.g., \nimmunization programs and human resource development).14 \n \n6.  Gaps in knowledge and innovation. Pacific DMCs have few opportunities for regional \nexchange on health issues, with limited capacity for evidence-based planning and decision \nmaking. Statistics on service utilization and other systems indicators in most Pacific DMCs are \nscarce, making it difficult to budget, rationalize service delivery, and inform policy. Papua New \nGuinea, through ADB, has introduced a digital health management information system from which \nothers could learn. There is still much to be done in other areas of innovation (e.g., pooled \nprocurement of essential medicines, telemedicine).15 Pacific DMCs need support in adapting \ninnovations to their local contexts.  \n \n7.  Gaps in cross-sector support. Projects in other sectors can potentially benefit the health \nsector. Opportunities in cross-sectoral collaborations to improve health through basic sanitation, \nand hygiene and safe drinking water, should be maximized in water projects and other urban \nprojects in the region. Similarly, there are health benefits from improved transport safety; better \nsolid waste management; and tertiary, technical, and vocational education projects that may \nimprove access to health service providers and enhance the quality of health services. Pacific \nDMCs need support in strengthening innovative ways to work across sectors to maximize health \nbenefits and improve other social determinants of health.  \n \n8.  Other Pacific challenges. Climate change will continue to affect Pacific DMCs with \ncyclones, flash floods, and sea-level rise exposing key health facilities to significant risks. For \nexample, the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed the National Referral Hospital in \nSolomon Islands, which is built within 2 meters of the mean high tide, to be unsafe and in need of \nimmediate relocation.16 Underfinancing of operations and maintenance is a persistent problem in \nthe Pacific, and this impacts the quality of health infrastructure, health technology, and ancillary \ninvestments including staff housing, utility provision to health facilities, and waste management \nfacilities. In the worst cases, health facilities are forced to shut down, and these are often in the \nrural and remote island areas with the greatest health needs.  \n                                                \n11  WHO. 2016.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: healthy lives ensured and the well-being for \nall at all ages promoted.17 The TA will have the following outcome: government capacity and \nreadiness for health sector development in the Pacific enhanced. The TA will focus on supporting \nselected Pacific DMCs, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu in particular, with ongoing or planned \nhealth sector investments across two outputs.18 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1:  Health system investments in Pacific developing member countries \nassessed and prioritized. ADB is expanding health operations across the Pacific, with tentative \ninvestments identified in Solomon Islands for 2020 and Vanuatu for 2021. The Government of \nSolomon Islands has committed to relocate the National Referral Hospital and the devolvement \nof primary and secondary care services to subnational health facilities in its National Health \nStrategic Plan, 2016\u22122020.19 This TA will address gaps by supporting the prefeasibility tasks of \naffordability and economic sustainability analysis, financing strategies, and risk assessments. In \nVanuatu, the TA will help identify priority health investment needs and assess readiness of the \nsector and provide advice on how to apply technologies and digital solutions. The output will also \naddress gaps in knowledge by supporting capacity development in data management, health \nimpact assessments, and other studies related to water and sanitation, education, gender, and/or \nurban development to identify cross-sectoral opportunities for effective health investments in \ncountries and/or regions. \n  \n11.  Output 2: Innovative health interventions determined, promoted, and implemented. \nThe TA will support Pacific DMCs in identifying and adopting innovations and best practices to \nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of health service delivery. This output will address gaps \nin knowledge and the assessment of opportunities to introduce innovations, such as health \ntechnologies, medical devices, use of blockchain systems, and pooled procurement; and build \nthe national capacity to adopt innovations sustainably through technical experts. This output will \nalso seek to enhance regional cooperation and exchange of information to support the adoption \nof innovation and best practices through workshops, conferences, and publications. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, staff \ntime, country data, counterpart staff for capacity building activities and regional meetings, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \n \n                                                \n17 United Nations. Sustainable Development Goals\uf8e7Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all \nages. \n18 ADB will identify the participating DMCs for TA support as potential health sector investment opportunities arise \nduring the implementation period, including but not limited to commitments made to the development investment \npipeline. \n19  The Government of Solomon Islands and ADB agreed in June 2018 to support the conduct of prefeasibility studies.  \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB\uf8e7through the Urban, Social Development, and Public Management Division of the \nPacific Department\uf8e7will implement the TA; select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; and \norganize workshops in close consultation with the participating governments. ADB is experienced \nin  conducting  operational  research  and  implementing  capacity  building  and  institutional-\nstrengthening activities. The TA team will maintain close coordination with the resident missions \nand other development partners during TA implementation.

Consulting services. The TA will require consulting services of international and national \nspecialists and experts, including but not limited to health economists, health services and \nmanagement specialists, impact evaluation specialists, engineers, environment specialists, and \nother resource persons who have relevant experience in health facility design and construction, \nsurveying, safeguards, and health technologies. The TA team will use a combination of individual \nconsultant  selection,  indefinite  delivery  contract,  and  output-based  lump  sum  contracts  for \nconsulting firms. The TA team will prepare the detailed terms of references at a later stage \nbecause the specific technical and expertise needs are unique (each supporting DMC will identify \nthem).  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  following  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as \namended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff \ninstructions.20  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis for \nDeveloping the Health Sector in the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n20 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nEnsuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages (Sustainable Development Goal 3)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutcome  By the end of 2023:     \nEnhanced  a.
