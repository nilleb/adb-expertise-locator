I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational Development (OFID), both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Medium-Voltage \nSub-Transmission Expansion Sector Project.1 \n2.  The proposed project will expand the supply of reliable and cost-effective grid electricity \nin Kampong Thom, Kampong Cham, Siem Reap, Kandal, and Banteay Meanchey provinces in \nCambodia.  It  will  (i)  expand  the  electricity  transmission  infrastructure  by  constructing \n2,110 kilometers  (km)  of  22-kilovolt  (kV)  sub-transmission  lines,2  (ii)  support  Electricit\u00e9  du \nCambodge  (EDC)  in  implementing  the  subprojects,  and  (iii)  improve  the  operational \neffectiveness and efficiency of EDC.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n1.  Socioeconomic Context \n3.  Cambodia\u2019s power sector was severely damaged during long periods of conflict and civil \nwar. Private, independent power producers4 using their own generation from imported diesel \nand heavy fuel oil were engaged in 1994 to provide electricity to main load centers such as \nPhnom Penh, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, and other provincial towns through isolated systems. \nSince 2005, a primary focus of power development has been to build high-voltage (230 kV and \n115 kV) and medium-voltage (22 kV) sub-transmission lines to import electricity from neighbor \ncountries  and  provide  affordable  services,  build  demand,  and  facilitate  grid  extension  by \nconnecting the isolated systems. By 2012, four high-voltage lines were in operation, three at \n115 kV (414.95 km) and one at 230 kV (91 km). Development of three distinct grid systems is \nprogressing in the southern, eastern, and northeastern economic zones. \n4.  At about 26%, the rate of household electrification in Cambodia is among the lowest in \nSoutheast Asia\u201480% of Cambodia's population lives outside provincial and district towns, and \nonly 11% of households in these areas are connected to grid electricity supply, mainly through \nisolated  systems  owned  and  operated  by  private  rural  electricity  enterprises  (REEs)  that \ngenerate their own power from imported diesel and heavy fuel oil. More than 11 million people \nuse rechargeable car batteries for electricity supply, and kerosene and candles for lighting. \n5.  Electricity from rechargeable car batteries and REEs is expensive. In areas supplied by \nREEs, electricity tariffs are highly volatile due to fluctuating fuel prices and range from $0.65 per \nkilowatt-hour  (kWh) to $0.90/kWh.  For  electricity  from  rechargeable  car  batteries,  the  cost \naverages $1.00/kWh. \n6.  Besides being expensive, electricity services from REE-operated systems are generally \nunreliable and of poor quality. Coupled with high electricity costs, this severely constrains quality \nof life. Domestic firms and foreign investors name the high costs and supply shortages of \nelectricity as a main constraint to doing business in Cambodia. This is critical, especially as the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The term \u201csub-transmission\u201d is applied in Cambodia to describe these lines in contrast to the distribution networks \nowned and operated by rural electricity enterprises (REEs). Sub-transmission lines transport bulk power supplies \nfrom the high-voltage grid to REEs. However, these lines should not be confused with high-voltage transmission \nlines\u2014in terms of their scale and impacts these sub-transmission lines are equivalent to distribution lines. \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Rural \nElectrification Project. Manila.  \n4  These are the REEs mentioned in footnote 2. ", "2 \ngovernment aims to diversify from garments to other sources of growth, such as commercial \nrice farming, other agribusiness, tourism, and light manufacturing. \n2.  Institutional Arrangements \n7.  The key  organizations  in  Cambodia\u2019s  power  sector  are the General Department of \nEnergy under the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy; the Electricity Authority of Cambodia \n(EAC); EDC; REEs; and other private domestic and foreign investors. \n8.  The General Department of Energy guides and supervises the development of the \npower sector and is responsible for overall energy planning, policy, and strategy. EAC is the \ncountry\u2019s regulatory agency, responsible for issuing rules, regulations, and procedures and \ngoverning the power market operators, both suppliers and users. EDC, the country\u2019s national \npower utility, is responsible for electricity production, transmission, and distribution in licensed \nareas assigned to EDC by EAC. \n9.  To supplement the capability of EDC in developing power sector infrastructure, the \ngovernment is encouraging the private sector to invest. The promotion of private participation in \nelectrification  is  also  anchored  in  Cambodia\u2019s  Electricity  Law  (2001).  REEs  represent  an \nimportant  private  sector-based  framework  for  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the \ncountry\u2019s  distribution  network.5  In  addition,  private  domestic  and  foreign  investors  are \nencouraged to invest in (i) oil and gas exploitation, (ii) energy generation from indigenous \nresources such as hydropower, and (iii) developing the high-voltage transmission system. \n3.  Subsector Problems and Constraints \n10.  Technical sustainability. Cambodia\u2019s high electricity tariffs are caused by its power \ninfrastructure, which is still dominated by isolated, inefficient generation and distribution systems \npowered  by  diesel  and  heavy  fuel  oil. With  the  realization  of  large-scale  domestic  power \ngeneration, the electricity grid will continue to evolve. It is planned that by 2015, large-scale \npower generation, mainly from hydropower, will reach 1,116 megawatts, all of which is to meet \ndomestic demand estimated to grow at an average 26% per annum up to 2015. An additional \n1,489 km of 230 kV and 115 kV transmission lines are expected to be operational by 2015. \n11.  The expansion of power generation and the high-voltage transmission network requires \nthat medium-voltage sub-transmission and low-voltage (<0.4 kV) distribution lines be developed \ncommensurately to transfer electricity to consumers. It is estimated that about 17,000 km of \nmedium-voltage  sub-transmission  lines  need  to  be  built  to  connect  the  isolated  systems \nthroughout  the  country.  These  developments  will  help  displace  expensive,  unreliable,  and \nenvironmentally and health-wise hazardous off-grid diesel generation by REEs and will partly \ncontribute to reducing electricity costs. EAC is implementing a tariff policy that requires REEs to \ngradually reduce retail tariffs to at least $0.28/kWh within 2\u20133 years of being connected to \nEDC\u2019s 22 kV sub-transmission backbone.6 \n12.  Financial capacity. EDC does not receive budgetary support. It needs to mobilize \nexternal financing to build the country\u2019s grid-electricity infrastructure. While independent power \nproducers are investing in power generation and construction of high-voltage transmission lines, \nEDC is primarily responsible for investing in the extension of medium-voltage sub-transmission \n                                                \n5  Most REEs operate under a consolidated generation and distribution license. Most of the roughly 300 licensees In \n2012 are consolidated licensees. \n6  Through the connection to EDC\u2019s 22 kV sub-transmission backbone, REEs will receive lower-cost electricity at a \nregulated bulk-supply tariff of $0.13\u2013$0.15 per kWh. The tariff is discounted depending on the distance of the REE \nfrom EDC\u2019s network. The cost savings are gradually transferred to end-consumers in public consultation with the \nserviced community. Although affordability to pay for electricity consumption must be considered, the tariff strategy \naims to encourage REEs to further expand their distribution network into lower-density, higher-cost areas. ", "3 \nlines. The cost of doing so beyond provincial towns, estimated at $21,000 per km, is high. \nCoupled with low population density and low consumption, the return on investment is marginal \nand will, without concessionary financing from development partners, imperil EDC\u2019s long-term \nfinancial sustainability. \n13.  Affordability.  Affordability  represents  a  major  barrier  to  increasing  grid-electricity \nsupply. On an average monthly income of $98, a household will need to pay $70\u2013$120 to get \nconnected to the grid (including connection fee, wiring from the meter, and house wiring). The \ngovernment is trying to relieve the situation by piloting a scheme that provides lower-income \nhouseholds with interest-free loans to finance connection to the grid. The pilot is implemented \nby the Department of Rural Electrification Fund, a department established under EDC in August \n2012. The operational capacity of the department needs to be strengthened to scale up the \ninterest-free loan scheme. \n14.  Human resource development. To allow EDC to efficiently and effectively keep pace \nwith  the  expansion  requirements,  human  resource  capacity  in  the  key  business  areas  of \nstrategic, operational, financial, information technology, and human resource management need \nto be strengthened, and pertinent strategies, policies, processes, and procedures need to be \nfurther updated, developed, and implemented. \n4.  Strategy and Road Map \n15.  In  its  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP),  2009\u20132013,  the  government \nrecognizes the importance of developing the energy sector to ensure socioeconomic growth and \nthereby reduce poverty to at least 19.5% by 2015. The government has developed the 2011 \nStrategy  and  Plan  for  Development  of  Rural  Electrification  in  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia \n(SPDRE) to achieve 52% household electrification by 2020 and 70% household electrification \nby  2030,  mainly  by  expanding  the  country\u2019s  grid-electricity  infrastructure.  EDC  is  primarily \nresponsible for investing in the expansion of the 22 kV sub-transmission backbone network to \nconnect the grid substations of provincial towns to existing and new distribution networks owned \nand operated by REEs. REEs will continue to play an important role in providing electricity to \nconsumers after connection to EDC\u2019s sub-transmission grid. \n5.  Asian Development Bank Sector Experience \n16.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  greatly  contributed  to  the  expansion  of \nelectricity access, sector reforms, and institutional capacity building by continuously supporting \nthe power sector with investments and technical assistance.7 ADB\u2019s country assistance program \nevaluation  for  Cambodia,  1998\u20132008  assessed  the  energy  sector  assistance  strategy  and \nprogram as relevant, effective, likely sustainable, and substantial in impact.8 \n17.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation  identified  efficiency  issues  related  to \nimplementation delays. Delays can partly be attributed to EDC\u2019s limited human resource and \noperating capacity for (i) finalizing detailed technical designs, (ii) handling procurement, and \n(iii) implementing  safeguard  measures  in  an  effective  and  timely  manner.  The  risk  of \nimplementation delays under this project will be mitigated by (i) a high degree of readiness for \nsubproject  implementation  with  detailed  technical  designs,  land  clearance  and  other \ngovernment approvals, as well as advanced procurement in place before the proposed loan is \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2003.

Rationale for the Sector Loan Modality \n18.  A sector loan provides consistent and coordinated support to EDC with a critical amount \nof financing for physical and nonphysical investments in line with the objectives of the NSDP \nand SPDRE. Those objectives are fully consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and \nits energy assessment strategy and road map for 2011\u20132013.9 Three of five subprojects to be \nfinanced as part of the sector loan have been appraised and approved with regard to their \ntechnical, financial, economic viability, and environmental and social sustainability. Two more \nsubprojects, already determined, will be appraised and approved during the implementation of \nthe project. The sector loan approach internalizes the appraisal and approval of these additional \nsubprojects in accordance with technical, financial, economic, environmental, and social criteria \nmutually agreed upon between ADB and EDC.10 With the existence of a road map, subsector \nstrategy, and institutional development framework strongly owned by the government and EDC, \nthe key requirements for using the sector loan modality are met. \n7.  Development Partner Coordination \n19.  Development  partner  coordination  has  in  the  past  provided  the  government  with \nopportunities to synergize interventions from ADB, the World Bank, and bilateral partners, and \nto capitalize on best practices. Physical investment requirements of an estimated $1.0 billion are \nrequired  to  achieve  the  government\u2019s  electrification  objectives,  exceeding  the  financing \navailable from any one development partner. By providing financial support for improving both \nphysical  infrastructure  and  institutional  development,  ADB  will  continue  to  add  value  to \nCambodia\u2019s energy sector. Moreover, through effective development coordination, ADB could \nleverage additional financing for this project from OFID. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The project will contribute to increasing access to grid electricity in Cambodia. The \noutcome  of  the  project  is  expanded  supply  of  reliable  and  cost-effective  grid  electricity  in \nKampong Thom, Kampong Cham, Siem Reap, Kandal and Banteay Meanchey provinces. \n \nC.  Outputs \n1.  Component 1: Expanding Medium-Voltage Sub-Transmission Network \n21.  Component 1 of the project will support EDC in the expansion of 22 kV sub-transmission \nlines. These sub-transmission lines will be connected from grid substations in provincial towns to \nexisting and new distribution and service lines owned and operated by REEs. The project will \nfinance  the  construction  of  2,110  km  of  sub-transmission  lines  divided  into  five  provincial \nsubprojects: (i) 625 km in Kampong Thom, (ii) 184 km in Kampong Cham, (iii) 866 km in Siem \nReap, (iv) 263 km in Kandal, and (v) 173 km in Banteay Meanchey province. Subproject 1 in \nKampong Thom, subproject 2 in Kampong Cham, and subproject 3 in Siem Reap province have \nbeen fully appraised and approved. \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Component 2: Supporting EDC in Implementing Subprojects \n22.  Component 2 will support EDC in implementing the subprojects with a focus on finalizing \ndetailed engineering design, procurement and contract management, construction supervision, \ntesting  and  commissioning,  implementation  and  monitoring  of  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards, project performance monitoring and evaluation. Project implementation consultants \nwill complement existing staff of EDC, thus ensuring a high degree of implementation efficiency \nof subprojects financed under the project. On-the-job training to EDC staff in procurement and in \nthe preparation and implementation of safeguard documents and gender-balanced compliance \nmeasures will be provided. \n3.  Component 3: Improving the Operational Effectiveness and Efficiency of \nEDC \n23.  Component 3 will support EDC in developing and implementing strategies, policies, \nprocesses, and procedures to effectively and efficiently manage its growing operations. Courses \nwill be provided to EDC management and staff to strengthen the institutional capacity in various \nkey operational areas including (i) strategic corporate planning and management, (ii) financial \nmanagement and investment planning, and (iii) gender-balanced human resource management. \nThis component will support the operational integration of the recently established Department \nof Rural Electrification Fund and will also include the rollout of EDC\u2019s financial accounting and \nenterprise public utility organization management information system to its provincial branches. \nD.

The government further requested OFID to provide $10 million to finance jointly with \nADB goods and works for the construction of the 22 kV sub-transmission lines.13 ADB will \npartially administer the OFID loan. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of \n5 years, and an interest rate of 2.5% per annum. The government will act as the borrower and \nrelend to EDC under the same terms and conditions, with an interest rate of 2.65% per annum. \n28.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n30.  The 22 kV sub-transmission line routes are generally designed along major roads.15 \nThree-phase lines have been favored, as the lines will form the backbone of the grid-electricity \nnetwork and can be subsequently overlaid with appropriate two-wire, single-phase spur lines for \nvillages away from the major roads. The required transformer capacity, medium-voltage feeder \nroute and rating have been sized on peak household demand assuming a standard load of \n0.375 kilovolt-ampere per household and considering that, within 5 years, at least 80% of \nhouseholds will be connected to the grid. The grid substations in Kampong Cham, Kampong \nThom, and Siem Reap are currently supplied with imports from Viet Nam and Thailand. The \npower purchase is sufficient to service additional connections. The supply capacity from grid \nsubstations in provincial towns and the voltage performance were reviewed in a power system \nanalysis. The project includes the installation of automatic voltage regulators to maintain voltage \nperformance of long medium-voltage feeders. The design for subprojects 1, 2, and 3 is found to \nbe technically viable. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n31.  Subprojects  appraised  for  the  project  are  economically  and  financially  viable.  The \neconomic internal rate of return is 17.4%. The financial internal rate of return is 3.8%. The \neconomic and financial internal rates of return exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital \nof 12% and weighted average cost of capital of 1.6%, respectively. The economic and financial \n                                                \n15 Villages in Cambodia are largely linear in nature and aligned along major roads. Most villages are located within \n500 meters of the road. \n ", "8 \nnet present values are positive. Sensitivity analysis indicates that subprojects\u2019 economic and \nfinancial internal rates of return are viable under stressed conditions. The subprojects generate \na net financial and economic surplus.16  \n32.  A review of EDC\u2019s financial performance and projections concluded that EDC\u2019s capital \nstructure to meet its debt service requirements and its capacity to finance investments from \ninternal resources are adequate. \nC.  Governance \n33.  EDC  has  implemented  several  high-voltage  and  medium-voltage  transmission  line \nprojects funded by ADB, other development partners, and financing institutions. EDC staff have \nextensive  experience  and  sufficient  skills  to  implement  projects.  A  project  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and implementation capacity assessment of EDC concluded that \nthe executing agency has adequate financial accounting, auditing and reporting, procurement \nand implementation arrangements in place for implementing the project. However, EDC will be \nrequired to implement multiple transmission line projects up to 2020 that could constrain its \nhuman resource capacity. Therefore, consulting services to support and complement staff in the \nimplementation of the project will be engaged. \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and EDC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n35.  A household survey conducted in the project areas suggests that the primary use of \ncommercial electricity supplies is to partially replace the use of kerosene for lighting and of car \nbatteries for other electrical appliances. With the development of the 22 kV sub-transmission \nline network, the average electricity cost for consumers will be gradually reduced by at least \n60%, allowing households to increase consumption. Non-household consumers such as rice \nmills, craft work, and small service businesses are present in the project areas and economic \nactivities are likely to increase with more cost-effective and reliable electricity supply. \n36.  The Department of Rural Electrification Fund is already implementing a pilot scheme of \nproviding lower-income households with interest-free loans to finance the connection to the \nelectricity grid. Component 2 of the project supports EDC with the operational integration of the \nDepartment of Rural Electrification Fund, which will involve the development of strategies, \npolicies, processes, and procedures for scaling up the provision of interest-free loans to at least \n10,000 per year. The government and EDC have given their assurances to continue efforts to \nincrease connectivity of households and lower electricity costs to consumers so as to maximize \nthe socioeconomic benefits of the project. Support mechanisms are to be provided to all eligible \nhouseholds  irrespective  of  ethnicity,  gender  of  household  head,  or  other  conditions  of \nvulnerability. \n37.  Women occupy key roles in EDC in management, procurement, administration, finance \nand accounting, and corporate and business planning. The project supports the implementation \nof a human resource policy encouraging gender balance at all levels as well as capacity \ndevelopment of female staff in the various departments. In addition, the project ensures that \n100% of affected households headed by women are consulted on resettlement plans; joint \ncertification of male and female household members is required on compensation receipts; and \n                                                \n16 Economic Analysis: Project 1 and Financial Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). ", "9 \nan awareness campaign to prevent HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections, and human \ntrafficking is conducted. 17 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n38.  An environmental assessment and review framework and resettlement framework has \nbeen prepared for the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \nCambodia\u2019s  regulations  and  guidelines.18  Both  frameworks  guide  EDC  and  the  project \nimplementation consultants in preparing and implementing safeguard measures. \n39.  Environment. The safeguard category for the project is B for environment. An initial \nenvironmental examination report with an environmental management plan and implementation \nbudget has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and will be \ndisclosed on ADB's website.19 No component of any of the three appraised subprojects is \nlocated in an environmentally sensitive or protected area, and adherence to good international \nconstruction practices will mitigate any potential impacts during construction. The main impact \nduring  preconstruction  will  be  the  clearing  of  unexploded  ordnance  in  the  project's  sub-\ntransmission corridor, and before civil works begin, a certified unexploded ordnance clearance \ncertificate needs to be obtained. \n40.  Resettlement and indigenous people. The safeguard category for the project is B for \ninvoluntary resettlement and C for indigenous peoples. A resettlement plan with an estimated \ncompensation budget has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nand will be disclosed on ADB's website.20 No physical relocation will be required and, in this \ncase, the term \u201cresettlement\u201d relates to limited acquisition of livelihood trees and crops. Potential \nimpacts will be limited to the installation of concrete poles using about 0.2 square meters of land \nand the stringing of conductors requiring the trimming of some tree branches. Some trees may \nneed to be removed in a few villages and market areas. The estimated impact of tree removal is \n1 tree per 2 km, including productive trees such as mango, palm, coconut, and tamarind. \n41.  The environmental assessment and review framework, resettlement framework, initial \nenvironmental  examination,  and  resettlement  plan  were  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on \n1 October 2012. \nF.
