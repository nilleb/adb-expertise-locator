THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior loan of $10 million to Khan Bank, for the purpose of supporting its US dollar lending \nactivities, particularly to its corporate lending. \n  \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Mongolia\u2019s Economy and Banking Sector \n \n2.  Economic Assessment. Mongolia is experiencing an unprecedented period of strong \neconomic  performance.  Real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaged  7.9%  over   \n2003\u20132005 and rose to 8.4% in 2006, aided by sharp increases in copper and gold prices and a \nrecovery of the livestock herd after three devastating winters. As incomes have grown, the \nexpansion has spilled over to other sectors of the economy including construction, financial \nservices, and the retail sector. After a brief upward spike in 2005, inflation has been brought \nback down to the mid-single digits (average of 8.4% over 2003\u20132005 and 6% in 2006), and the \nbudget has moved into surplus (a surplus of 3.9% of GDP in 2006 from a 7.7% deficit in 2000). \nStrong  monetary  growth  has  been  buoyed  by  economic  growth,  expanding  credit,  and \nincreasing financial depth. The exchange rate policy of Bank of Mongolia (the central bank) has \nkept the currency, the tugrik, fairly stable and free of swings over the past 5 years. The balance \nof payments has been in surplus since 2000, reflecting external assistance, a strong flow of \nremittances  from  overseas  workers,  and  moderating  trade  and  current  account  deficits. \nInternational reserves, which were heavily drawn down in late 2003 in connection with the \nsettlement of Mongolia\u2019s pre-1991 debt to the Russian Federation, have been reconstituted to \nmore favorable levels. Total external debt has stayed at approximately $1.6 billion during the \nperiod 2004 -2006, and most of it is concessional. Mongolia is rated B+/B+ by both Standard & \nPoor\u2019s  and  Fitch,  and  Ba2/B2  by  Moody\u2019s,  for  foreign  and  local  currency  long-term  debt \n(Appendix 1). \n \n3.  Economic Outlook and Challenges. The medium-term economic outlook for Mongolia \nis positive\u2014assuming stable commodities prices, continued foreign direct investment inflows, \ngood macroeconomic management, and political stability. Projections are for GDP growth of 7%, \ninflation  of  6%,  and  a  current  account  surplus  of  2%  of  GDP  for  the  period  2007\u20132008. \nManufacturing, livestock, and services will all contribute to ongoing GDP growth. However, with \nsome large minerals deposits expected to come into production in 2009\u20132010, the country is on \nthe verge of a potential mining sector boom, which will be a major driver of GDP expansion. \nNevertheless, the economy remains susceptible to weather and commodity price shocks, and \ngrowth is geographically concentrated with a narrow economic base. \n \n4.  Financial and Banking Sector. With combined assets amounting to over 80% of GDP \nand over 90% of financial sector assets in 2006, the banking sector dominates Mongolia\u2019s \nfinancial sector. The banking sector is comprised of 16 commercial banks, all of which have \nbeen privatized, with four having foreign ownership. Following a series of banking crises in 1994, \n1996, and 1998, the financial performance of the banks has, in general, improved over the last \n3 years and the sector was profitable between 2000 and 2006. The banks generally adhere to \nBasel Core Principles and are preparing for the adoption of the Basel II accord. The total \ncapital-to-asset ratio of the banking sector increased from below 4% in 1998 to 17% in 2005. \nAsset quality for the banks has also improved, despite the rapid growth in lending\u2014annual \ncredit grew on average by 81.5% between 2000 and 2005, and by 42% in 2006, primarily driven \nby economic recovery, a more competitive financial market structure, and foreign capital inflows. ", "2   \nThe officially reported nonperforming loans (NPLs) ratio declined from 54% in 1999 to 9% in \n2006,  while  loan  loss  reserves  increased,  in  line  with  Bank  of  Mongolia  guidelines. \nNotwithstanding this improvement, the banking sector remains at an early stage of overall \ndevelopment, as indicated by the fact that most lending remains short-term and collateral-based \nand interest rates are high, reflecting a shortage of term funding and inadequate credit appraisal \nsystems at many banks (Appendix 2). \n \nB.  Corporate Lending Trends and Prospects \n \n5.  Corporate Development in Mongolia. Recent changes in the income tax regime have \ncreated a favorable environment for business consolidation and the growth of larger companies. \nNew tax laws enacted in June 2006 lowered the corporate income tax rate and modified the \ndual taxation system that until then was inducing companies to split in order to avoid a higher \ntax bracket. The new regime reduces the two corporate income tax rates from 15% and 30% to \n10%  and  25%,  and  also  increases  the  threshold  of  the  higher  rate  from  MNT100  million \n($85,000) to MNT3 billion ($2.5 million). Many enterprises that officially operated as individual \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the past to avoid the higher tax rate are now \nmore  likely  to  officially  declare  their  true  organizational  structure  and  function  as  larger \ncompanies. There is considerable potential for the development of corporate banking services \nand financial products that specifically meet the needs of corporate clients. \n \n6.  Lack of Financial Services as a Constraint to Corporate Growth. Traditionally, banks \nin  Mongolia  have  concentrated  on  retail  banking  and  collateral-based  lending  to  small \nenterprises. Few banks have corporate banking divisions and fewer still have concentrated on \ndeveloping corporate banking products tailored to the needs of larger corporations. As a result, \nthose larger companies that exist attempt to their meet long-term financing needs with high \ninterest rate, short-term, collateral-based loans and often find it difficult to meet their working \ncapital requirements. With the economy expected to grow substantially over the medium term, \nMongolian enterprises are expected to face rapidly growing demand. Without access to efficient \nfinancial services, these enterprises will be constrained in their ability to expand and upgrade \ntheir operations to meet growing demand, heightening the need for long-term financing to \nsupport their growth.   \n \nIII.  THE BORROWER \n \nA.  Background \n \n7.  Khan Bank was established in 1991 as the Agricultural Cooperative Bank of Mongolia \nfrom the assets of the former State Bank, which was liquidated at the end of the communist era. \nKhan Bank was created with the specific goal of serving the rural sector. During its early years \nof  operation,  it  faced serious  financial  problems  related to  poor  management  and  political \nfavoritism in the disbursement of loans. In 1999, the World Bank made reforming Khan Bank a \ncondition of its Financial Sector Adjustment Credit Program for Mongolia, and the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development (USAID) agreed to provide funds for an outside management \ncontract. In 2000, a contract was signed with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) of Bethesda, \nMaryland, USA, to manage Khan Bank. Management\u2019s mission was to (i) restore financial \nsoundness to Khan Bank, (ii) bring financial services to the country\u2019s rural population, and (iii) \nprepare Khan Bank to operate independently as a precursor to privatization. \n \n8.  The Bank was privatized in March 2003, with the purchase of 100% of the shares by H.S. \nSecurities  Company  Ltd.  (H.S.  Securities),  a  Japanese  conglomerate.  H.S.  Securities \n ", "    3\nsubsequently sold 40% of its shares to Tavan Bogd Trade, a local Mongolian conglomerate. In \n2004, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) purchased a 9.1% share in Khan Bank and \nDAI purchased an additional 2.2% share. In 2006, the chief executive officer purchased a 0.3% \nshareholding in Khan Bank \n \n9.  Khan Bank is the main provider of financial services, both retail and business lending, in \nthe rural areas of Mongolia and increasingly in Ulanbaatar where it now has 54 branches and is \npenetrating the SME and corporate markets. With the largest branch network in the country\u2014\n440 locations, 88% of which are in rural areas\u2014Khan Bank provides deposit and loan products \nto almost 80% of the households in Mongolia. Looking to build on its success in the rural sector,  \nits growing penetration in Ulanbaatar and its solid reputation in the market, Khan Bank believes \nthat it is well placed to expand the scope of its operations with the aim of becoming the principal \nnationwide financial services company in Mongolia in the next 5 years, delivering a full range of \nbanking, investment banking, leasing, securities and possibly insurance services in both rural \nand urban areas. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED LOAN \n \nA.  ADB Loan \n \n10.  Khan Bank has identified a need to source US dollar financing in order to expand its US \ndollar lending activities. ADB proposes to provide a US dollar-denominated senior loan of up to \n$10 million to Khan Bank.  \n   \nB.  Main Terms and Conditions \n \n11.  The loan documentation will include financial covenants as well as covenants relating to \nADB\u2019s policies.1 ADB will ensure that its rights to accelerate and enforce its debt will be \ntriggered under cross-default provisions with any outstanding debt facility.  \n \nC.  Provision of Technical Assistance \n \n12.  ADB will consider the possibility of including Khan Bank under ADB\u2019s regional technical \nassistance  (TA)  Capacity  Building  for  Financial  Institutions  program.2  Possible  areas  of \nassistance under the TA would be capacity building for internal control procedures.  \n \nV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Justification of ADB Loan \n \n1.  Investment Objective \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s objective in the proposed transaction is to improve financial sector efficiency and \ndepth, and contribute to the diversification of the Mongolian economy. The growth of larger \ncorporations  is  essential  to  the  sustainable  diversification  of  the  economy.  The  growth  of \n                                                 \n1 These covenants include (i) compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies; (ii) compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s policies to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and corruption; (iii) the maintenance of \nadequate debt service coverage ratio, accounts receivables, and total liabilities to net worth ratio; and (iv) a \nnegative pledge on Khan Bank\u2019s existing assets.  \n2 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Financial Institutions. Manila. \n ", "4   \ncorporations is conditional on the availability of corporate lending services and financial services \nthat meet the specific needs of larger companies. \n \n2.  Project Outcome \n \n14.  Expansion of Corporate Banking Activity. The growth of Mongolian enterprises to \noptimal  size  is  constrained  by  the  availability  of  term  lending  and  financial  services.  The \noutcome of ADB\u2019s proposed loan will be to expand corporate banking activity and provide the \nneeded financial services to allow the growth of Mongolian enterprises to optimal size. \n \n3.  Value Added of ADB  \n15.  ADB\u2019s proposed loan will add value by enabling Khan Bank to offer longer maturities and \ngrow its corporate banking business. \n \n4.  Design and Monitoring Framework \n \n16.  ADB will measure the expected development impact of the loans. The performance \nmeasures  will  follow  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group's \nStandards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Development impact will be \nmeasured in three distinct categories: (i) private sector development, (ii) business performance, \nand (iii) economic sustainability (Appendix 9).  \n \n5.  Fit to Sector and Country Strategy  \n \n17.  One of the two pillars of ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Mongolia3 \napproved in 2005 aims to diversify the sources of growth. The CSP explicitly aims to develop a \nsound financial system with improved efficiency and outreach. The proposed loan will contribute \ndirectly  to  the  implementation  of  the  CSP  by  strengthening  financial  intermediation  for \nbusinesses and fostering economic diversification. The ADB intervention assists in deepening \nfinancial markets and providing long-term finance that meets the needs of entities that are most \nlikely to provide much-needed diversification of the Mongolian economy. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s public sector operations for Mongolia also support the objectives described in this \nsection through projects including the Financial Regulation and Governance Program Loan4 and \nTA provided in association with the program, including assistance aimed at capacity building of \nthe  Financial  Regulatory  Commission.  The  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  Project 5  \ncurrently under preparation expects to develop the export capacity of larger agro-processing \nenterprises, and the availability of adequate financial services will be crucial to the sustainable \ndevelopment of these enterprises. The proposed loan is therefore also in line with activities \ncurrently undertaken by the East Asia Regional Department of ADB.   \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n19.  The proposed loan has been assigned an \u201cFI\u201d environmental classification and a \u201cC\u201d with \nrespect to indigenous people and resettlement. Khan Bank will be required to establish an \nenvironmental management system, within a timeframe to be specified, following the prescribed \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2005.

(ADB will review and \napprove the developed EMS.) Further, Khan Bank will build capacity for implementing it in \naccordance with its specific business needs and with the help of ADB, and will send at least one \nKhan Bank officer to attend an ADB-sponsored environmental management training.  \n \n20.  Given Khan Bank\u2019s lengthy relationship with IFC, the Bank is familiar with the concept of \nan EMS, and has guidelines in place to help it in developing one appropriate to its business and \nneeds. The Bank is also interested in participating in ADB\u2019s EMS training program. \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy: Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n \n21.  Khan Bank was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy relating to Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism6. Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require \nKhan Bank to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Further,  Khan  Bank  will  be  required  to \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB \nand Khan Bank will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings.   \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n22.  The proposed loan would, once approved by the Board, represent 69% of ADB\u2019s total \nnon-sovereign exposure7 in Mongolia, and would increase its investment in (i) Mongolia from \n0.19% to 0.45%, and (ii) exposure in banking systems from 22.79% to 22.83%. The proposed \ninvestment is within ADB\u2019s aggregate, country, industry, group, and single project exposure \nlimits for non-sovereign investments.  \n \n23.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  loan  agreements  following  approval  of  the  proposed \nfinancing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. These agreements will be on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n24.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nMongolian Government will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nADB loan to Khan Bank. No loan will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003.

I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$10,000,000  to  Khan  Bank  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined based on the procedures applicable to ADB\u2019s private sector operations and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report \nand as may be reported to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n10 July 2007 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nMONGOLIAN ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT \n \n \n26.  Gross Domestic Product. Recent economic performance has been very robust, with \nstrong,  broad-based  growth,  declining  inflation,  growing  budget  and  balance  of  payments \nsurpluses, and improving confidence in the banking system. Real gross domestic product (GDP) \nis estimated to have risen by 8.4% in 2006, higher than the average pace achieved during \n2002\u20132005. The minerals sector has been a key engine of growth, supported by record high \nprices for copper and gold; some increases in production volumes; and investment at the new \nIvanhoe copper and gold mine, which has not yet come on stream. Outside the mining sector, \ngrowth  has  also  been  supported  by  favorable  weather  conditions,  buoyant  residential  and \ncommercial construction, and rapid growth in financial services. Growth is projected at about 7% \nin 2007. \n \n27.  Inflation. After spiking higher in the first half of 2005, inflation has since slowed to a \nmoderate rate. The year-on-year inflation rate jumped from 10.5% in December 2004 to 17.5% \nin June 2005, partly because of a temporary shortage in the supply of meat which sent prices \nsoaring. As the supply shock was reversed, inflation declined to 1.8% (year-on-year) in July \n2006, the lowest level in 4 years. Inflation subsequently registered 5.1% for 2006. \n \n28.  Fiscal Indicators. The fiscal position has improved markedly in recent years, driven by \nthe rapid increase in copper prices and by faster-than-expected economic growth. The overall \nbudget balance shifted from a deficit of 4% of GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 3% in 2005 and 3.9% \nin 2006. Underlying the dramatic improvement in fiscal performance has been a sevenfold \nincrease in mining revenues between 2003 and 2006 caused by (i) sharply higher copper and \ngold prices, and (ii) the imposition of a new windfall tax on copper and gold in June 2006. \nMeanwhile, total expenditure has fallen from 42% of GDP in 2003 to an estimated 31.5% in \n2006, despite the 2006 introduction of a 30% wage increase and an expansion of social welfare \ntransfers.  Delays  in  the  execution  of  some  investment  projects  also  slowed  the  pace  of \nspending. As fiscal performance has improved, the net present value of public debt dropped \nfrom 80% of GDP at the end of 2003 to 45% at the end of 2005. As of year-end 2006, it fell \nfurther to 35%. \n \n29.  Monetary Developments. Monetary aggregates have been growing rapidly. Reserve \nmoney growth picked up from 20% (year-on-year) in December 2005 to 27% in September \n2006. The acceleration in reserve money reflected strong foreign exchange inflows, which more \nthan offset a substantial decline in net central bank credit to government. For the banking \nsystem as a whole, broad money increased by 35% in 2006. Net domestic assets of the banking \nsystem declined in 2006, as a sharp drop in net credit to government exceeded the impact of \nrapid growth in credit to the private sector. The subdued response to date of inflation to the \nrapid monetary growth reflects an ongoing process of re-intermediation as (i) incomes have \nrisen, (ii) confidence in the banking system has improved, and (iii) the gradual appreciation of \nthe exchange rate has helped to restrain the prices of imported goods.  \n \n30.  External Developments. The current account was in surplus for the third consecutive \nyear in 2006, and is expected to be about 2% in 2007 and 2008. The increase in the surplus has \nbeen driven by a marked improvement in the terms of trade, which more than offset a rise in \nimport volume growth and higher investment income payments. With increased inflows of direct \ninvestment in the mining sector and a recovery in disbursements of concessional official loans, \ngross international reserves reached $687.3 million (5 months of imports of goods and services) \n ", "8  Appendix 1 \nas of year-end 2006, while the net present value of external public debt fell to 32% of GDP, half \nthe level at year-end 2003. \n \n31.  Exchange Rate. Exchange rate developments have reflected the improvements in the \nterms  of  trade  and  capital  inflows.  The  real  effective  exchange  rate  of  the  togrog  has \nappreciated  by  about  18%  since  the  end  of  2004.  In  terms  of  the  US  dollar,  the  togrog \ndepreciated by 0.5% in 2005 but appreciated by 4% during the course of 2006. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  9\nBANKING SECTOR OVERVIEW AND PEER ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Background \n1.  With combined assets amounting to over 80% of gross domestic product (GDP) and \nover 90% of financial sector assets, the banking sector dominates Mongolia\u2019s financial sector. \nThe sector has evolved since transition and has recently experienced considerable growth. After \na number of crises and bank failures after transition\u2014most severely in 1994, 1996, and 1998\u2013\n1999\u2014the stock of bank lending had remained in a range of MNT30 billion\u2013MNT40 billion up to \n2000. Since 2001, however, loan growth has risen substantially upon completion of substantial \nbanking sector reforms.1 The total capital-to-asset ratio of the banking sector has increased \nfrom below 4% in 1998 to 17% in 2005. Annual credit grew on average by 81.5% between 2000 \nand 2005, and by 42% in 2006, primarily driven by economic recovery, a more competitive \nfinancial market structure, and foreign capital inflows. All 16 commercial banks have been \nprivatized, with four have foreign ownership. Financial performance of banks in general has \nimproved in the last 3 years, and the sector was profitable during 2000\u20132006. \n \nB.  Regulation and Supervision \n2.  The Banking Law, enacted in 1996 and amended a number of times since, provides the \nlegal basis for the Bank of Mongolia to regulate and supervise the banking sector. The Bank of \nMongolia\u2019s supervisory capacity over the banking sector, just as its role as the regulator, was \nextremely weak for several years. However, with the assistance of the International Monetary \nFund, the Bank of Mongolia has made substantial progress in strengthening its supervisory and \nregulatory capacities. As part of this process, the Bank of Mongolia has implemented several \nreform measures. Among the most significant of the reform measures has been the gradual \nincrease in the minimum capital requirement for banks (minimum paid-in capital doubled from \nMNT4 billion to MNT8 billion) and the strengthening of loan provisioning. There is now general \nadherence to Basel Core Principles. Preparation for the adoption of the Basel II accord is \nongoing. \n \n3.

Peer Analysis \n4.  The Mongolian banking industry is evolving into a two-tier system, consisting of a group \nof larger banks with strong shareholder support (most with foreign ownership) and a collection \nof smaller, mainly locally owned banks, some of which will have difficulty competing as they are \nundersized and under-matched. Khan Bank is considered one of four top-tier banks together \nwith Trade and Development Bank, Golomt Bank, and Anod Bank. Of the smaller second-tier \nbanks, XAC Bank, Savings Bank, and Post Bank compete with Khan Bank in the rural sector. \n \n5.  Trade and Development Bank is the largest bank in Mongolia in terms of total assets \nand is rated Ba2 by Moody\u2019s. Primarily a corporate bank, its competitive position could be \nfurther bolstered because of a recent ownership change that could prompt a merger with two \nother banks\u2014UB City Bank and Capitron Bank\u2014and expand its position in the small and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) market. The Bank of Mongolia is, however, scrutinizing the \ntransaction as to the source of funds applied to the purchase. Golomt Bank, also a largely \ncorporate-based bank, is aggressively expanding its Ulaanbaatar business, but it lacks a strong \nretail network. Anod Bank is suffering from periodic liquidity problems and recent growth has \nbeen poor.  \n \n6.  Of the smaller banks, XAC Bank, which has largely focused on microfinance in the past, \nis making a push into the SME market. XAC Bank has a well-managed franchise network in the \nrural regions, strong profitability, and a solid capital position with superior asset quality. It is \nrated  Ba2  by  Moody\u2019s.  However,  its  true  performance  is  uncertain  because  of  its  diverse \nsources of funds and donor support.
