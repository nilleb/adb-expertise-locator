THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Solomon Islands for subprogram 2 of the Economic Recovery Support Program.1 \n \n2.  The Economic Recovery Support  Program is a program cluster of two subprogram \ngrants totaling $10.0 million.2 The program cluster aims to assist in making the adjustment to an \neconomic and fiscal deterioration aggravated by the global economic crisis. Subprogram 2 of \nthe program cluster will support improved fiscal management and structural measures that will \naid economic recovery and place the economy on a sustainable medium-term growth path. \nBudget  support  will  help  protect  the  delivery  of  basic  services  to  the  vulnerable,  and  be \ncomplemented by actions to engage with key stakeholders. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Solomon Islands economy has been among the most affected in the Pacific by the \nglobal economic crisis. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 7.3% per annum in the \n5 years to 2008. In 2009, GDP contracted by 1.2%. Solomon Islands returned to positive growth \nof  around  7.2%  in  2010.  While  economic  growth  rebounded  quickly,  medium-term  growth \nprospects  are  uncertain.  Stocks  for  the  key  industry\u2014logging\u2014are  expected  to  be  largely \nexhausted by the middle of the decade. The economy is also one of the most aid-dependent in \nthe world.  \n \n4.  The program cluster was designed to support the Government of Solomon Islands to \nmake short-term fiscal adjustments in response to the global financial crisis and lay a foundation \nfor strengthening the medium-term reform agenda. Since its initiation, the program has helped \nthe  government  weather  the  recent  global  economic  crisis  with  its  financial  position \nstrengthened, largely due to the efforts made under the government\u2019s reform program supported \nby  the  Core  Economic  Working  Group  (CEWG)  development  partners.3 The  change  in \ngovernment  in  late  2010  required  additional  time  to  resume  work  on  formulating  and \nimplementing policy. The new government, however, remains strongly committed to continuing \nregular and systematic policy dialogue through the CEWG to support the reform program. The \nCEWG donor coordination model in Solomon Islands is considered to be a best-practice model \nof donor coordination in the Pacific.4 The government is now committed to improving the quality \nof public expenditure for better service delivery, as reflected in the government policy statement \nand the new National Development Strategy (NDS) 2011\u20132020 (currently being finalized). \n \n5.  From subprogram 1 to subprogram 2. Subprogram 1, which was completed in 2010, \nachieved successful policy and institutional reforms. Solomon Islands satisfied all 19 conditions \nfor the subprogram 1 grant and the single tranche, totaling $5 million, was fully disbursed.5 \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster and \nGrant for Subprogram 1 to Solomon Islands for the Economic Recovery Support Program. Manila. \n3  CEWG development partners include ADB, Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, the Regional Assistance \nMission to Solomon Islands, and the World Bank. \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n5  Progress, achievement, and lessons learned from subprogram 1 are in Sector Assessment (Summary): Public \nSector Management, and Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). ", "2 \nSubprogram 2 completes the program reform agenda under the program cluster. In addition, \nafter the program completion, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will continue to be involved in \nproviding  policy  advice,  offering  technical  assistance  (TA),  and  monitoring  reform  progress \nagainst  the  incremental  reforms.6 Subprogram  2  supports  the  government\u2019s  economic  and \nfinancial reform program in coordination with key development partners including Australia, the \nEuropean  Union,  New  Zealand,  the  Regional  Assistance  Mission  to  Solomon  Islands,  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank.  \n \n6.  Subprogram 1 has effectively supported recovery from the crisis with growth, and the \nfiscal  and  external  positions  all  significantly  improved  in  2010  compared  with  2009. 7 \nSubprogram 2 continues to (i) support the government with the adjustment costs arising from \nimplementing an economic reform program to place the economy on a sustainable growth path, \nand (ii) facilitate a diversification of the economy away from unsustainable levels of logging and \naid. It supports improved fiscal management and structural measures to ensure sustainability of \nthe economic recovery and helps protect the delivery of basic services to the vulnerable. \n \n7.  After closely consulting with the government and accounting for evolution of priorities \nand policies, the prior policy actions for subprogram 2 were finalized, closely approximating the \n24 indicative triggers identified at the time of subprogram 1, with two modifications. One of the \nindicative triggers, regarding amendment of the bareboat charter law, was removed in light of a \nconsensus that impediments to operation of the franchise shipping scheme had been more \nefficiently addressed with other measures. Another indicative trigger, concerning adoption of the \nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) principles, was adjusted to recognize that \nSolomon  Islands  has  officially  endorsed  the  principles,  with  the  consequential  legislative \namendments in the tax regime to be proposed through government undertakings in the grant \nagreement. All 23 prior policy actions and conditions in the policy matrix have been performed \nand satisfied, except for the adoption of NDS, which is at an advanced stage. ADB is currently \nsupporting the government in preparing the NDS.8 Completion of the adoption of the NDS is a \ncondition to the effectiveness of the grant agreement.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  expected  impact  of  subprogram  2  is  the  achievement  of  a  higher  and  more \ninclusive path of economic growth. The expected outcome is to continue the positive trend of \neconomic recovery with protection of the vulnerable and the fiscal position. The impact and \noutcome are to be achieved through reforms in the four program outputs, leading to improved \nfiscal management, an improved enabling environment for the private sector, support for the \nvulnerable,  and  strengthened  communication  and  ownership  of  policy  actions  by  the \ngovernment and the general public. \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  Subprogram  2  continues  the  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions  begun  under \nsubprogram 1. \n                                                 \n6  On 9 June 2011, the cabinet endorsed the medium-term policy matrix with triggers and actions to be accomplished \nand assessed annually by the end of 2011, 2012, and 2013. This medium-term policy matrix will be a basis for \nCEWG development partners in providing additional budget support to the government. \n7  Detailed economic and fiscal analyses and the recovery are in Economic Analysis, and detailed macroeconomic \ntrends are in Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  ADB. 2010.

This output is directed to achieving the \nmedium-term goals of achieving overall fiscal discipline, providing strategic guidance to public \nfinancial  management  (PFM)  reform,  ensuring  effective  expenditure  controls  are  in  use, \nraising the efficiency and fairness of the revenue system, and improving the allocation of \npublic  resources  through  strengthened  budgeting  and  planning  processes.  This  output \nsupports  short-term  fiscal  consolidation  while  seeking  to  maintain  the  capacity  to  fund \nessential  services  and  public  investment  over  the  medium  term.  The  output  also  helps \naddress shortcomings in governance. The emphasis is on initiatives that address the weakest \nareas  of  PFM  identified  in  the  2008  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment.9 ADB operations have also provided additional technical support for achievement \nof output 1 through several TA projects.10 \n \n11.  Achieving overall fiscal discipline. Subprograms 1 and 2 provide for adherence by \nthe 2010 and 2011 budgets and the medium-term fiscal framework to the fiscal commitments \nof  the  Honiara  Club  Agreement11 (or  any  updated  arrangement  put  in  place  with  the \ninternational community). Under subprograms 1 and 2, the government committed to keep the \npublic debt\u2013GDP ratio below 30% and to keep the ratio of payroll charges to GDP in 2010 to \nno more than the 2009 level. Under the agreement, the government committed to (i) avoid \nfurther borrowing or sovereign guarantees until the government reaches green light status \nunder the international debt distress rating system, and (ii) maintain a fully funded recurrent \nbudget  excluding  the  use  of  borrowing  to  fund  recurrent  expenditure.  There  has  been \ncompliance with these fiscal provisions. \n \n12.  The 2011 budget, which was approved by the Parliament on 11 April 2011, is consistent \nwith fiscal consolidation and was assessed by ADB. The budget is based on the assumption of \ncontinued economic expansion and, consistent with the Honiara Club Agreement, does not \nenvisage new sovereign borrowing. Due attention has been paid to supporting the delivery of \nessential services, with priority given to maintaining recurrent budget for education, health, \ntransport, and grants, such as provincial grants, at original 2010 levels, which comfortably \nexceed  the  2009  benchmark  by  an  amount  greater  than  the  value  of  the  ADB  loan.  The \ngovernment's  contribution  to  the  development  budget  has  also  increased  substantially. \nAdditional budget support (both general and sectoral) is factored into the budget, including a \ngrant of SI$40 million (around $5 million) from ADB. Payroll is estimated at 10.2% of GDP, a \nlower figure than for the previous 2 years as growth in payrolls has been kept below that of \nnominal GDP. A cash cushion of 3 months of recurrent expenditure has been provided for as \nrequired by the conditions of the IMF program for standby credit facility.12 The IMF mission, \nwhich  was  fielded  on  3\u201313  May  2011,  found  that  the  IMF  program  performed  well,  with \n                                                 \n9  European Union. 2008.

Significant fiscal risks nonetheless remain. The key risk factors in the budget include (i) \nthe potential for an overestimation of domestic revenue, that is forecast to rise by 12.0%; (ii) the \nprospect of a decline in logging; and (iii) expenditure pressures that may arise from the need for \nthe  government  to  accommodate  a  fractious  coalition,  which  may  result  in  a  series  of \nsupplementary appropriations. The large wage and salary bill will remain an ongoing source of \nfiscal pressure, and may displace funding for investment and goods and services if the revenue \noutcome is less than expected. \n \n14.  Moving to  multiyear  budgeting and strengthening the budgeting and planning \nprocesses.  Subprogram  2  provides  for  (i)  commencement  of  a  public  expenditure  review \n(launching  operation  of  the  new  budget  system  with  capacity  to  accommodate  multiyear \nbudgeting and integration of recurrent and development budgets), and (ii) instituting the new \nNDS.  The  NDS  has  been  under  formulation  since  early  2010.  In  May  2010,  the  cabinet \nendorsed (i) the national strategy framework, precursor to the NDS; and (ii) an NDS task force \ncomprising the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT), Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the Ministry of \nDevelopment  Planning  and  Aid  Coordination,  and  the  Central  Bank  of  Solomon  Islands. \nFollowing submission of the first draft NDS in December 2010, intensive work on stakeholder \nconsultation is anticipated to conclude with adoption of the NDS by late July or August 2011. \n \n15.  Providing  strategic  guidance  to  public  financial  management  reform.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the cabinet endorsed a number of measures to provide high-level strategic \nguidance  to  the  government's  efforts  to  improve  PFM.  Subprogram  2  provides  for \nimplementation of the strategies to improve whole-of-government financial reporting and internal \naudit. These actions are oriented towards the long-term goal of receiving an unqualified audit \nopinion on the whole-of-government accounts. \n \n16.  Ensuring effective expenditure controls are in use. The program has assisted the \nprocess of fiscal consolidation by strengthening expenditure controls including (i) upgrades to \nthe financial management information and payroll systems, (ii) preparation and adoption of new \nfinancial instructions, and (iii) cabinet endorsement of strategies to modernize supply chain \nmanagement (procurement) procedures under subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 provides for (i) \nimplementing  new  financial  instructions,  (ii)  \u201ccleansing\u201d  the  payroll  data  to  increase  the \neffectiveness of the new payroll system introduced in subprogram 1, and (iii) implementing the \nmechanisms to tighten expenditure controls. Procurement compliance has been strengthened, \nwith the revised financial instructions becoming operational with effect from 1 July 2010.14 \n \n17.  Raising the efficiency and fairness of the revenue system. The Medium-Term Fiscal \nStrategy 2008\u20132013 outlined the government\u2019s commitment to further tax reform. Key objectives \nare  to  broaden  the  tax  base,  shift  reliance  away  from  direct  taxes,  and  simplify  the \nadministration of tax, both for the government and for taxpayers. Subprogram 2 provides for the \nadoption of cross-government revenue management enhancements covering legislative and \noperational  reform,  endorsement  of  EITI,  preparation  of  a  new  tax  regime  for  the  mining \nindustry, and commencement of a review of the Customs Act, overseen by a high-level steering \ncommittee. Subprograms 1 and 2 demonstrated concrete progress in revenue management by \nMOFT and its subordinated agencies.  By a cabinet decision on 19 May 2011, the government \n                                                 \n13 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 MOFT has developed procurement tools including revised and/or expanded procurement checklists and provided \ntraining to line ministries. Opportunities for further analysis of procurement information and publication of tender \noutcomes will be important to ensure effective implementation and compliance with the revised financial instructions. \n ", "5 \ninitiated  a  broader  cross  government  strategy  for  coordinating  revenue  management \nenhancement in other branches such as land and fisheries. \n \n18.  Output  2:  Productivity  enhancing  structural  initiatives.  This output implements \nstructural initiatives with the potential for short-term boosts in economic activity and those \nreforms needed to achieve medium-term rebuilding of economic growth. A key concern is \ndiversifying the economy away from logging and foreign aid towards alternative sources of \ngrowth\u2014agriculture  (primarily  palm  oil,  cocoa,  and  copra),  fishing  and  marine  products, \nmining, and tourism.15 \n \n19.  There are four areas of focus under this output: (i) improving the efficiency and reducing \nthe  drain  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  on  the  budget,  which  should  in  turn  reduce \ncrowding out of the private sector; (ii) deregulating the telecommunications industry to expand \nservice coverage, raise standards, and lower prices; (iii) enhancing the business regulatory \nenvironment  to  directly  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  Solomon  Islands;  and  (iv) \ndeveloping the transport infrastructure to raise investment levels and service standards and \nlower transport operating costs. \n \n20.  Improving accountability and performance of state-owned enterprises. Subprogram \n2 provides for (i) public release of an annual SOE  monitoring report,16 (ii) endorsing debt \nrestructuring for the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA) and new appointments to \nsenior positions, (iii) completing the tender process for sale of Sasape Marina and initiating a \nrestructure of Solomon Airlines, and (iv) implementing SOE regulations on community service \nobligations and appointing directors with a view to further enhancing performance. Subprogram \n2 requires further actions to resolve the debt that the Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA) \nowes to the SIEA (more than SI$20 million). A joint donor program\u2014the Pacific Regional \nInfrastructure Facility\u2014is currently funding advisory assistance to SIWA. An output from this \nassistance includes completing the recovery action plan, which includes proposed measures to \nsettle SIWA\u2019s debt to the SIEA. \n \n21.  Deregulating the telecommunications industry. The program provides for the end of \nthe legislated monopoly on mobile telecommunications. Under subprogram 1, the voluntary \nrelinquishment  of  the  existing  operator's  exclusive  license  was  completed  and  new \ntelecommunications legislation was enacted. Subprogram 2 provides for the continuation of this \nprocess  through  the  commencement  of  operations  of  an  independent  regulator.  The \nTelecommunications Commission has been operating as the independent telecommunications \nregulator with a self-funding mandate. \n \n22.  Reducing the cost of doing business. The government is implementing a number of \nreforms aimed at reducing the cost of doing business and ensuring a level playing field for all \nbusinesses. The Companies Act 2009 and the Companies (Insolvency and Receiverships) Act \n2009 and associated regulations were gazetted and commenced on 1 July 2010. The new \ncompany registry commenced operation on the same day with paper-based registration; the \nnew electronic registry successfully went live in December 2010. To ensure sustainability of the \n                                                 \n15 ADB operations that have provided additional support to achieve this output area include: ADB. 2006.

Developing  transport  infrastructure.  Subprogram  2  provides  for  (i)  updating  the \nnational  transport  plan  to  implement  an  updated  3-year  rolling  work  program,  and  (ii) \nimplementing  the  franchise  shipping  scheme  and  Solomon  Islands  Maritime  Safety \nAdministration. Redesign of shipping routes and insurance coverage was introduced to bring \nabout  timely  modification  and  successful  operation  of  the  scheme  without  the  need  for \nlegislative revisions earlier anticipated during subprogram 1. \n \n24.  Output  3:  Support  for  the  vulnerable.  The  budget  support  provided  under  the \nprogram  cluster  will  allow  a  slightly  higher  level  of  government  expenditure  than  would \notherwise be possible. Additional financial resources provided by ADB will reduce the national \nbudget's financing gap and thereby help preserve the delivery of basic transport services, rural \nhealth  services,  and  basic  education.  The  increased  budget  allocation  for  education  and \nhealth is more critical for females than males in Solomon Islands, given the current gender \ngap in these sectors. Specifically, the government made commitments under subprogram 2 \nregarding the additional allocation of its own funds under the 2011 recurrent budget to goods \nand services (i.e., nonpayroll costs) to education, health, and infrastructure services. These \nadditional funds are at least equal to the level of the grant provided under subprogram 1. The \n2011 recurrent budget, less the sum of the payroll and development budgets, provided an \nadditional  allocation  of  SI$157  million  from  2009  levels  for  education,  health,  and \ninfrastructure services, which substantially exceeds the grant of approximately SI$40 million \nprovided under subprogram 2. \n \n25.  Output 4: Communication and ownership of policy actions. Under subprogram 2, a \ncommunications and engagement strategy is being developed to explain the government\u2019s \nresponse  to  the  global  economic  crisis,  including  (i)  actions  to  address  the  needs  of  the \nvulnerable, (ii) the state of public finances and PFM reform, and (iii) structural initiatives. Public \nrelease of key fiscal information has been expanded to include debt statistics and operation of \nan MOFT website. The engagement strategy developed in consultation with stakeholders was \nendorsed by the cabinet in May 2011. \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n26.  The government has requested a grant17 not exceeding $5 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  grant  size  was  determined  after  due \nconsideration of (i) the estimated impact of the global economic crisis and the associated overall \nprojected financing requirements for the national budget, which is estimated by the IMF at $25 \nmillion  annually  in  2010  and  2011;  (ii)  the  availability  of  additional  finance  from  other \ndevelopment partners; (iii) the significance and complexity of the policy actions of the program, \nwhich are expected to generate substantial development benefits; and (iv) the grant proceeding, \nthereby  allowing  the  government  to  expand  budget  expenditure  for  public  services  thus \nprotecting  vulnerable  populations  from  adverse  impacts of  the  global  economic  crisis.  The \ndetermination of grant size took into account the government's demonstrated commitment to, \nand progress in implementing, the policy agenda. \n                                                 \n17 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk \nof debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis in the IMF 2009 Article IV Consultation determined that \nSolomon Islands had a moderate risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation \nas grants. \n ", "7 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n27.  The program cluster period spans from 1 March 2009 to 28 February 2012, with the \nsubprogram 2 implementation period embracing 1 March 2010 to 28 February 2012 with post-\nprogram partnership monitoring efforts with other CEWG members to continue through 2013. \nSubprogram 2 funding will be provided as a single tranche grant of $5 million to be disbursed \nwhen the government has met the conditions for effectiveness including completion of the \nagreed prior policy actions as set forth in the policy matrix.18 \n \n28.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  to  Solomon  Islands  as  the  recipient \naccording to ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for program \ngrants.19 The proceeds will be used to finance items produced and procured in ADB member \ncountries;  items  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources are excluded.20 Grant proceeds disbursed against imports will require a \ncertificate from the government stipulating that the value of the total imports of Solomon Islands, \nminus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under \nother  official  development  assistance,  is  at  least  equal  to  the  amount  of  the  grant  to  be \ndisbursed during a particular year. Local currency generated from the proceeds of the grants will \nbe used to support public expenditure objectives under the program. \n \n29.  The MOFT will be the executing and implementing agency and will oversee policy, legal, \nand regulatory actions and ensure that the policy actions as agreed upon by the government \nand ADB are duly carried out on time. Several ongoing ADB TA projects (footnotes 10 and 15) \nare assisting the government in (i) implementing the reforms and meeting tranche conditions in \nthe short term, and (ii) building the government\u2019s capacity in the medium and long term. The \nMOFT is responsible for overall implementation of subprogram 2, including carrying out all \npolicy actions, program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records. \nThe MOFT will (i) establish and maintain a performance evaluation system for the program, \nwhich will be derived from the design and monitoring framework, policy letter, and policy matrix; \nand (ii) monitor and report to ADB, on a biannual basis over the term of the program, the \nimplementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes, in line with the program \nimpact and outcome indicators agreed upon with the government. Monitoring of outcomes and \nimpacts will maximize use of the government\u2019s own processes and the CEWG mechanism. \n \n30.  In  cooperation  with  the  MOFT  and  CEWG,  ADB  will  carry  out  periodic  reviews  of \nprogress implementation and assess the impact of the program, which continues from the well-\nfunctioning practice under subprogram 1.21 The government will continue to keep ADB informed \nof the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have \nimplications for program implementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment \non any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with the MOFT and key multilateral and \nbilateral agencies via the CEWG, will undertake regular reviews of program performance. The \nreviews will evaluate implementation of the policy reform measures and assess the impact, \ndescribe  lessons  identified  during  the  program  period,  and  outline  policy  actions  and  any \nassistance needed for sustained economic recovery. The program reviews and the design of \nsubprogram 2 have drawn on dialogue with stakeholders from the private sector and civil \n                                                 \n18 An informal Board seminar was held on 16 October 2009 to discuss program assistance to the Pacific developing \nmember countries: the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga. \n19 ADB. 1998.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n31.  Economic  growth  prospects  for  Solomon  Islands  rest  on  the  private  sector  and  on \ndevelopments in mining, agriculture, fishing, and, to a lesser extent, tourism. A large gold mine \nclosed during the civil unrest has recently reopened in March 2011, and there is potential over \nthe longer term to develop large nickel deposits. While mining projects would boost GDP, the \nsector would employ few people and there would be long lags before government revenue rose. \nThe best prospects for job creation and for higher government revenue lie in large-scale palm oil \ndevelopments, in fishing (there is already one large fish cannery), and in the smallholder tree \ncrops  of  cocoa  and  copra.  The  supply  of  fruit  and  vegetables  to  the  urban  centers  as  a \nsubstitute for imports also offers good prospects, as does the fledgling tourism industry. \n \n32.  A number of recent studies have examined the economic growth prospects allowing for \ndifferent scenarios. The studies have identified the potential for economic growth after logging, \nalbeit at only low to moderate rates that would see, at best, slow growth in real GDP per capita \nin the medium term. The studies have also highlighted the need for concerted government \naction to realize the potential growth, and the risk of inaction. \n \nB.  Governance \n33.  Public financial management. The quality of public sector financial management has \nbeen improved in recent years. The government has embarked on a series of public expenditure \nreforms, including clearing the backlog of unaudited central government financial statements, \nintroducing a medium-term fiscal framework, paying debt interest and trade creditor arrears, and \nincreasing  revenue  collection.  However,  a  number  of  weaknesses  remain  in  public  sector \nfinancial management that adversely affect public service delivery, threaten aggregate fiscal \ndiscipline,  and  undermine  the  strategic  allocation  of  public  resources.  To  address  the \nweaknesses, the government and development partners continue to deepen the reforms that \nsimultaneously strengthen the government\u2019s institutions and capacity.22 \n \n34.  Anticorruption.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the MOFT. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the legal documents and the grant regulations. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n35.  Through all four main program outputs, policy reforms are expected to have significant \npoverty and social benefits. Reforms under the first output of improved fiscal management allow \nthe government to dedicate more resources to pro-poor expenditure. Improvements in budget \nprocesses are expected to lead to more efficient service delivery. Policy actions under the \nsecond  output  to  enhance  productivity  are  aimed  at  increasing  economic  activities  and \ninvestment. Promoting private sector development was designed to support economic growth, \n                                                 \n22 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2) contains detailed information on public sector management performance, problems, and opportunities \nas well as the government\u2019s sector strategy and ADB sector assistance. Risk Assessment and Risk Management \nPlan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) also addresses risk mitigation measures.  \n ", "9 \njob creation, business opportunities, improved livelihood, and poverty reduction. More specific \nsupport for the vulnerable is featured in the third output by requiring an increased share of \nrecurrent budget funding for basic education, health, and rural transport services, in recognition \nof the extra hardship imposed by the global economic crisis and the preceding episode of high \ninternational commodity prices. Essential public services used by the most vulnerable (basic \ntransport, health, and education services) have been identified, and ADB grant resources will \nhelp maintain budget expenditure in 2011 on the goods and services used in their delivery. The \npolicy actions under the fourth output enhance the voice of the population, including poor people \nand women, regarding policy formulation and implementation. \n \n36.  The policy reforms under the program cluster have indirect impacts on gender equality \nand  empowerment  of  women.  Given  the  current  gender  gap  in  education  and  health,  the \nincreased budget is expected to benefit more women. While the policy reforms under the \nprogram  may  make  a  limited  and  indirect  contribution  to  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment, the improved PFM will have indirect benefits for poor people, who rely most on \npublic services as they cannot afford alternative services. The budget increase can be linked to \nwomen\u2019s  improved  access  to  basic  education  services  and  health  services,  particularly \nreproductive health services. The program requires monitoring of women\u2019s improved access to \nhealth and basic education services as indicated in the design and monitoring framework.23 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n37.  The  program  is  classified  as  category  C  with  no  significant  adverse  environmental \nimpacts identified. No involuntary resettlement or impacts on indigenous people are expected.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The program is designed in line with the government\u2019s 2011 budget and 2010\u20132012 \nmedium-term fiscal framework. The key assumptions underlying the program include that (i) \ndomestic political and macroeconomic stability is maintained, (ii) the global economy recovers \nfrom the financial crisis, and (iii) the government continues to be committed to improved fiscal \nmanagement and performance. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 1 \nand also described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPolitical instability weakens fiscal discipline and policy  ADB will continue policy engagement in the Core Economic \ncommitment.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n39.  The government and MOFT have assured ADB that implementation of the program \ncluster  and  subprogram  2  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the grant documents. \n \n40.  Specific  assurances.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  and \nMOFT have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: (i) \nthe government will (a) maintain the policies adopted and actions taken under subprogram 1 \nand subprogram 2 prior to the date of the grant agreement for subprogram 2, as described in \nthe  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  for  the  duration  of  the  program  and \nsubsequently; (b) promptly adopt the other policies and the other actions as specified in the \ndevelopment policy letter and the policy matrix; and (c) ensure that such policies and actions \ncontinue in effect for the duration of the program and subsequently; and (ii) the government and \nthe  program  implementing  agencies  will  ensure  that,  throughout  the  implementation  of \nsubprogram 2, adequate budgetary allocations of the required counterpart funds are made, \napproved, and released in a timely manner to ensure proper program implementation. \n \n41.  Condition  for  grant  effectiveness.  The  grant  will  become  effective  after  the \ngovernment has satisfactorily fulfilled all conditions for the release of the single tranche of \nsubprogram 2. Adoption of the NDS, anticipated by late July or August 2011, is the only \noutstanding item among these conditions.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding $5,000,000 to Solomon Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for subprogram \n2 of the Economic Recovery Support Program, on terms and conditions that are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n19 July 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms Risks\nImpact      Assumptions \nAchievement of a  Real GDP growth  National accounts,  Global economy \nhigher and more  progressively raised by  budget papers, CBSI  continues recovering \ninclusive path of  2012, from close to 0% in  quarterly reviews and \nPrivate sector responds \neconomic growth  2009 to a rate higher than  annual reports, \nto improved economic \nthe population growth rate  household income and \nconditions \n(latest estimate of  expenditure surveys \npopulation growth of 2.8%  No major natural \nper annum)  disasters \nRelative standard of living   \nof the most vulnerable  Risks \nmembers (sex \nPolitical instability \ndisaggregated) of the \nweakens fiscal \ncommunity improved, as \ndiscipline and policy \nmeasured by a rising \ncommitment \nexpenditure share of the \npoorest 20% of  Higher crude oil prices \nhouseholds between  damage the economy \n2005\u20132006 and the next \nhousehold income survey \n(2005\u20132006 level of 6.9) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nParliamentary and \nInitiation of economic  Real GDP growth in 2011  National accounts, \ncommunity support for \nrecovery combined  budget papers, CBSI \nNew national development  the government actions \nwith protection of the  quarterly reviews and \nstrategy released in 2011 \nvulnerable members  annual reports, medium- Government agencies \nof the community and  Average antenatal clinic  term development  committed to improved \nthe fiscal position  coverage for pregnant  strategy, health  fiscal management and \nwomen rates in  information system  performance \nrepresentative rural areas  (Ministry of Health and \nin 2011 no lower than the  Medical Services),  Development partners \nlatest 5-year average (as  Ministry of Education  provide timely technical \nreported in administrative  and Human  and budget support \nrecords)  Development records,  Central bank maintains \nIMF Article IV staff \nindependent monetary \nPrimary school enrolment \nreports, PEFA \nmanagement \nrates (sex disaggregated) \nassessments \nin representative rural \n \nareas in 2011 no lower \nRisks \nthan the latest 5-year \naverage (as reported in  Revenue position of \nadministrative records)  government \ndeteriorates and \nNo deterioration in 2011 of  impedes service \nthe \u201cmedium risk of debt  delivery \ndistress\u201d assessment from \nthe IMF  Change in cabinet \ncomposition slows the \nOverall improvement by  implementation of \n2011 against the 2008  policy actions \nPEFA assessment \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms Risks \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
