INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Samoa  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare a ports development master plan. The proposed TA is \nincluded in the ADB country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for Samoa, and is consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach,  2010\u20132014.1 The  government  concurs  with  the  TA  project\u2019s \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Samoa is a geographically compact country in the South Pacific with a population of \nabout 200,000, a recorded gross domestic product per capita of $4,212 in 2013, and a land area \nof 2,820 square kilometers. The two main islands\u2014Savai\u2019i and Upolu\u2014account for almost all \nthe  land  area.  Samoa\u2019s  small  size  makes  it  difficult  to  achieve  economies  of  scale  and \nproduction, although its compactness facilitates internal freight distribution and public service \ndelivery.  Samoa  faces  challenges  typical  of  small  island  economies,  including  geographic \nisolation, limited human and financial resources, a narrow economic base, and underdeveloped \nmarkets. The economy is heavily dependent on agricultural exports and fisheries, and imports of \nfuel and basic commodities. Samoa is isolated from major centers of trade and commerce, \nresulting  in  high  international  transport  costs. In  the  Doing  Business 2015  report,3 Samoa \nranked  80th  out  of  189  economies  in  the  ease  of  trading  across  borders.  Improved  port \ninfrastructure will improve connectivity and boost economic development and poverty reduction.  \n \n3.  Samoa is at risk from the effects of climate change and geophysical hazards, which \naffect maritime transport infrastructure. An earthquake and tsunami in 2009 caused heavy \ndamage to embankments and terminal buildings at the newly built Aleipata wharf, resulting in \nrevenue losses and reconstruction costs. Cyclone Evan in 2012 damaged a number of ports in \nUpolu and Savai\u2019i, particularly at the old wharf in Apia. During 1969\u20132010, 52 tropical cyclones \npassed within 400 kilometers of the capital city of Apia. Samoa\u2019s coastal zone is also vulnerable \nto ongoing sea level rise\u2014sea level has risen by about 4 millimeters per year since 1993,4  and \nis projected to rise by 5\u201315 centimeters (cm) by 2030, 10\u201329 cm by 2055, and by 21\u201359 cm by \n2090.  Projections  indicate  that  tropical  cyclones  will  intensify.5 A  2010  World  Bank  study \nestimated the present economic value of damage through 2050 resulting from climate change in \nthe absence of additional adaptive measures to be $104 million to $212 million over the same \nperiod in Samoa.6   \n \n4.  The Samoa Ports Authority (SPA) was established in 1999 as a state-owned enterprise. \nSPA has a legacy of operational and institutional practices carried over from when the ports \nwere managed by the Ministry of Works, Transport, and Infrastructure. Many of these practices \nhave not kept pace with modern port management, reducing the efficiency of service delivery to \nport  users  and  revenue  to  SPA.  Suboptimal  infrastructure  investment  and  asset  leasing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Samoa, 2015\u20132017.

License agreements to lease land and port facilities provide little yield, \nundermining SPA\u2019s revenue. As a result, inadequate funding is allocated for the O&M of core \ninfrastructure  such  as  navigation  aids,  fenders,  bollards,  and  terminal  container  yard \npavements,  which  are  severely  deteriorated.  Until  July  2014,  SPA  operated  six  facilities,7 \nincluding assets created through SPA\u2019s 2006\u20132009 capital works program. Operating revenues \nfrom the newly constructed assets do not cover direct operating expenses and debt finance \nrepayments. SPA\u2019s consolidated financial results in 2012 reported a loss of ST2.28 million with \na turnover of ST12 million. \n \n5.  The  Matautu  Port  in  Apia  serves  nearly  100%  of  Samoa\u2019s  international  trade  and \naccounts for 90% of SPA\u2019s revenue. It provides a base for passenger and freight movement via \ninternational and coastal vessels. Operational characteristics include acceptable dwelling times \nfor  ships  in  port,  occasional  queuing  of  vessels,  and  limited  operation  times.  Vessels  are \nincreasing in size, making berthing operations more difficult and less safe. Ships berthed at the \nmain wharf are subject to excessive movement because of the intrusion of swell into the harbor, \nespecially during the wet season, which poses operational and safety hazards during loading \nand unloading. Low demand in the local economy has led shipping lines that formerly operated \ndirect international container services to consolidate their operations through transshipment via \nFiji. As a result, import and export container movements have plateaued. International container \nship arrivals at Apia declined from 174 in 2008 to 105 in 2014, with berth occupancy of 12.5%. A \npreliminary analysis indicated forecast trade growth for Matautu port did not expect to exceed \n3% per annum between 2030\u20132020. 8  \n  \n6.  A study conducted by the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) recommended \nthat SPA\u2019s financial position be improved by (i) reducing its debt through a short-term subsidy \nfrom the government and sale of nonrevenue-generating assets, (ii) reviewing tariffs through \nbenchmarking  against  other  Pacific  ports  and  adjusting  container  storage  charges,  (iii) \nrecommending reforms to enable full private sector participation in port services, (iv) increasing \nland  and  property  rentals,  (v)  reducing  fixed  and  variable  costs  through  organizational \nrestructuring, and (vi) preparing a ports master plan.9 TA to support recommendations (i) to (v) \nis being implemented by PRIF, and will improve SPA senior management capabilities, redefine \nSPA\u2019s organizational structure, provide responsibilities and accountability for SPA\u2019s budget, and \nenhance  port  services  by  encouraging  better  private  sector  participation.  The  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency is also providing support to SPA by extending the existing \nwharf at Matautu Port. \n \n7.  The government has also identified as a priority the development of a proposed new port \nat  a  greenfield  site  at  Vaiusu  Bay.10 The  government  has  also  entered  into  preliminary \nagreements with private tuna processing companies to occupy the existing container yard and \nwarehouse space at Matautu Port for tuna loining. The construction of new tuna processing \nplants will limit the container yard space, which could impact the port\u2019s container throughput and \nport productivity. Moreover, the introduction of tuna processing could lead to berth congestion, \nas fishing vessels occupy the port\u2019s berthing facilities to discharge their catch. \n                                                \n7  The six facilities are Matautu Port, Apia Fishing Wharf, Mulifanua domestic terminal, Salelologa domestic terminal, \nAleipata ship repair facility, and Asau Wharf. The Mulifanua and Salelologa domestic terminals were transferred to \nSamoa Shipping Corporation as of 1 July 2014 through a cabinet decision.   \n8  PRIF. 2013. Samoa Ports Authority Scoping Study.

Competing  port  sector  development  necessitates  development  of  a  master  plan  to \nidentify and prioritize investments in existing port infrastructure, and assess the need for new \ninfrastructure. It will complement the PRIF study (footnote 9) by sequencing key reforms to \nimprove the financial sustainability of SPA. The ports master plan will also help ensure that \nexisting and new port infrastructure will be resilient to the effects of climate change and natural \ndisasters. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be financially sustainable investments in Samoa\u2019s port sector \nby 2016. The outcome of the TA will be a government endorsed 20-year ports development \nmaster plan by 2016. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  To achieve the outcome, the TA will deliver the following outputs: \n(i)  Output  1:  Demand  assessment  and  port  utilization  study.  The  demand \nassessment will carry out a review and 20-year forecast for vessel throughput for \ncontainer  services,  tankers,  general  cargo  vessels,  cruise  ships,  and  fishing \nvessels.  Baselines  will  be  established  for  berth  utilization,  and  berth  facility \nproductivity for the facilities operated by SPA. The study on port utilization will \nconsider  future  tenants  that  will  occupy  container  yard  space,  capacity \nconstraints  during  high  container  discharge,  infrastructure  and  equipment \nconstraints, and the effect of seasonal storms on stacked empty containers. The \nstudy  will  also  recommend  an  optimized  configuration  of  new  investment, \nrehabilitation, and allocation of activities to attract vessel calls, improve revenue \ngeneration,  and  ensure  SPA\u2019s  financial  sustainability.  The  study  will  also \nconsider the involvement of private sector participants to improve the efficiency \nof cargo operations. \n(ii)  Output 2: Swell mitigation study. A study will be undertaken of swell intrusion \ninto the harbor at Matautu Port. It will recommend engineering measures to \nattenuate the swell to an acceptable level for uninterrupted vessel loading and \nunloading operations, and will determine baselines for safety incidents that occur \nat the port. \n(iii)  Output 3: Initial technical and economic assessment for Vaiusu Bay Port \ndevelopment.  The  study  will  carry  out  an  initial  engineering  and  economic \nassessment for a proposed new greenfield port development at Vaiusu Bay to \nprovide a preliminary indication of its viability. The economic analysis will (a) \nconsider the macroeconomic context of Samoa, the demand assessment carried \nout  under  output  1,  and  alternatives  and  least-cost  analysis;  (b)  compare \ninvestment  and  operating  costs  with  expected  benefits;  and  (c)  assess  the \nsustainability of the investment. It will also carry out sensitivity and risk analysis. \nThe economic analysis will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). The initial assessment will also \nconsider potential environmental, resettlement, and social impacts that would be \nexpected in association with the proposed development. The study will consider \nland transport linkages to and from the industrial zones. \n ", "4  \n(iv)  Output 4: Asset management plan. An asset management plan will be drafted, \nwhich will (a) identify assets critical for the sustainable delivery of port services, \ntheir  minimum  lifecycle  costs,  annual  expenditures  for  maintenance,  and \nreplacement time and cost; (b) define medium- to long-term organizational and \nfinancial  strategies  to  sustain  the  asset  management  plan;  and  (c)  prepare \nplanned maintenance, repair, and renewals linked to SPA\u2019s business plan and \nbudget.  The  asset  management  plan  will  incorporate  the  findings  and \nrecommendations from the ongoing PRIF TA (footnote 9) to improve operational \nand financial performance. It will also consider recommendations for insurance \ncover for certain capital equipment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan appear in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing  agency,  responsible  for  the  overall \nadministration of the TA. SPA will be the implementing agency responsible for guiding and \noverseeing the consultants. The TA will require consulting services consisting of 10 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  4  person-months of  national  specialist  inputs.  ADB  will  select \nindividual consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  individual  consultants  will  include  an  international  port \nspecialist (6 person-months), international port engineer (4 person-months), and a national \nproject administrator (4 person-months). Inputs are indicative and may be realigned to the TA \nrequirements. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Training and equipment will be procured by the Ministry of Finance and will follow \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The use of an advance \npayment facility will be considered. \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented from 30 April 2015 to 31 August 2016. ADB will field an \ninception  mission, regular review  missions,  and  a finalization  mission.  ADB  will  liaise  with \ngovernment  agencies  and  attend  stakeholder  workshops  at  inception  and  completion.  A \ncommittee chaired by SPA and including representatives from the Ministry of Finance and ADB \nwill monitor progress against schedules agreed upon during inception, and evaluate consultant \nperformance against draft and final deliverables.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Samoa for the Ports Development Master Plan, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1   5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2016:    Assumption \n \nFinancially  An investment project    SPA and the \nsustainable  following  government remain \ninvestments in  recommendations from the  committed to \nSamoa\u2019s port sector  endorsed ports  implementing the \ndevelopment master plan  master plan. \nis identified and approved \n(baseline: none) \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nGovernment- Master  plan  approved  by  SPA 2015 Annual   \nendorsed 20-year  SPA board by May 2016  Report  SPA\u2019s strategic \nports development  (baseline:  Approved  1987  planning for Apia Port \nmaster plan  Samoa Port master plan)  remains consistent. \n   \n   \nOutputs      Assumption \n \n1.
