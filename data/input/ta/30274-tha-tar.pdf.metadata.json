During the 1996 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the Kingdom\nof Thailand requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare a project to support the\ndevelopment of selected border towns through the creation of an improved physical, policy, and\ninstitutional environment that will help the Government realize its ultimate objective of regionally\nbalanced, equitable, efficient, and sustainable urban development. In response to this request,\nand following incorporation of the TA in the 1997 Country Assistance Plan, a Fact-finding\nMission for the proposed TA was fielded in August 1997. The Mission held discussions with\nrepresentatwes of the Central Government, and the provincial and local governments, external\naid agencies, and other stakeholders including urban residents and nongovernment\norganizations; and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope,\ncost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1\nii.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The urban population in Thailand is estimated at 22 million, or 36 percent of the\ncountrys population. A striking feature of the urbanization process is the excessive\nconcentration of population and economic activity in Bangkok and its vicinity resulting in\ngrowing environmental problems in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR), 2 and interregional\nincome disparities across the country. About 50 percent of the urban population live in the\nBMR. In the northeast, where 35 percent of the population reside, and the north, where 20\npercent of the population live, the average per capita incomes are only 30 percent and 40\npercent, respectively, of the income in the BMR. Current population trends show that BMR's\npopulation growth rate (3 percent per annum) is declining, while growth in some regional cities\nand towns is acce'erating by up to 6 percent per annum. Some border towns, with populations\nranging from 10,000 to 40,000 and with current growth rates of up to 4 percent per annum, are\nalso becoming increasingly important in the urbanization and development process mainly\nbecause of opportunities related to cross-border economic activities.\n3. The Government is concerned with the excessive concentration of economic\nactivity in the BMR and its environmental and socioeconomic consequences, and is pursuing\nphysical decentralization policies. A number of measures that the Government is implementing\nto promote decentralization include (i) strategic plans for developing regional economies; (ii)\ninvestment in infrastructure; and (iii) fiscal and banking measures to stimulate private\ninvestment in the target regions. The Regional Cities Project, which attempted to channel\nresources to regional centers, and the eastern and southern seaboard development projects, in\nwhich the Government is establishing deep-sea ports and industrial estates in the eastern and\nsouthern regions, are examples of the Government's specific efforts to achieve regional\ndispersal of economic activity and population. Subregional cooperation is also considered a\npotentially important instrument for balanced urban development. The Indonesia-Malaysia-\nThailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) is seen as playing a significant role in developing the\nsouthern region, and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is regarded as a contributing factor\nto the development of the north and northeast. Further, a number of strategically located border\ntowns, emerging as centers of economic activities in the process of subregional cooperation,\nare considered crucial for stimulating decentralization to peripheral areas. One important target\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 1997.\nThe BMR covers Bangkok Metropolitan Administration area and the neighboring five provinces.", "2\narea defined by the Eighth National Economic and Social Development Plan (1997-2001) is\ndevelopment of border provinces and towns, particularly those that have potential as economic\nbridges linking Thailand with neighboring countries.\n4. The Bank's country strategy, which is in line with the Governments policy,\nincludes (i) development of infrastructure and related policy and institutional reforms in less\ndeveloped regions with a view to equitable development and promotion of decentralization; (ii)\nhuman resources development; and (iii) effective management of the environment for\nsustainable development. The north, northeast, and the south are the priority areas for the\nBank's assistance. Two ongoing Bank TA projects, which are expected to lead to loans for\nimproving water supply and sanitation, target the northeast. The advisory TA2 being\nimplemented aims to strengthen the Government's capacity to formulate and monitor policies\nand programs on decentralization. Another dimension of the Banks strategy in Thailand is\nlinking economic activities in periphery regions to those in neighboring countries. Since 1992,\nthe Bank has provided various TA programs to promote subregional cooperation in the GMS\nand IMT-GT. Some priority projects identified under these programs have already progressed\ntoward Lmplementation. The feasibility studies for the East-West Transport Corridor, linking\nnortheast Thailand with the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam, and\nthe highway linking Bangkok to Phnom Perth and Ho Chi Minh cities were prepared under TA\nfrom the Bank. The issue of nonphysical barriers to subregional cooperation was also\naddressed under advisory TA.3\n5. Several other development partners are involved in the urban sector and border\ntown development. The Australian Agency for International Development provided TA for the\ndevelopment of Nong Khai town on the Thailand/Lao PDR border. The United Nations\nDevelopment Programme is embarking on a study to optimize the benefits for economic\ntransition and sustainable human development in the process of subregional cooperation. The\nstudy, which will cover the border area connecting the southern part of northeast Thailand to\nneighboring countries, will basically focus on social issues such as gender and health care. The\nJapan International Cooperation Agency is about to start TA for the preparation of a regional\nmaster plan covering the northeast region. The Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation\nrecently provided assistance in the preparation of the Spatial Development Framework with a\nview to coordinating the major investments of many public and private agencies affecting spatial\ndevelopment of the country. An ongoing World Bank study, Urban Development Under the\nEighth and Ninth Plans, focuses on setting up an urban development fund and strengthening\nlocal governments in selected regional cities.\n6. There is already evidence that the contribution of border towns to the national\neconomy is increasing. Trade in these towns has increased considerably. For example,\nMukdahan, which is on the route of the East-West Transport Corridor and which lies opposite\nSavannakhet of Lao PDR along the Mekong River, accounts for 30 percent of the total value .of\nthe border trade between Thailand and Lao PDR. At Aranyaprathet on the route of the\nTA No. 2568-THA:Notheast Region Water Supply and Sanitation, for $600,000, approved on 14 May 1996:\nand TA No. 2698-THA:Khon Kaen Water Supply and Sanitation, for $550,000, approved on 4 December\n1996.\nTA No. 2364-THA:Stxngthening Policy, Planning and Programming for Decentralization and Regional\nDevelopment, for $400,000, approved on 19 July 1995.\nTA No. 5686-THA:Mitigation of Nonphysica/ Bamers to Cross-border Movement of Goods and People, for\n$180,000, approved on 29 May 1996.", "proposed highway from Bangkok to Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh cities, the border trade is of\nutmost importance to the economy with the current trade volume estimated at 8120 million to\n150 million per month. Along the Malaysian border, the volume of exports has increased to 28\npercent of the total exports of the country. Some border towns are also playing increasingly\nimportant roles in the tourism industry, which is one of Thailand's major foreign exchange\nearners. At Sadao on the Malaysian border and the route of the north-south expressway from\nThailand to Malaysia and Singapore, the number of tourists entering Thailand, over the last ten\nmonths, has reached 500,000, much higher than the previous year. Chiang Saen in the north, a\ngateway to the Golden Triangle, receives 2,500 domestic and foreign tourists daily, In addition,\nsome of these towns are expected to become the locations of industrial cooperation with\nneighboring countries under various subregional economic schemes. 1 With the completion of\nongoing and planned projects in the process of subregional cooperation, it is expected that the\npace of development ri border towns will further accelerate.\n7. There are, however, impediments to the development of border towns. Although\nthere is a clear Government policy on physical decentralization, the policies in other related\nsectors, which have a direct bearing on the spatial distribution of economic activity, are not fully\nsupportive of this policy. The incentive policy, which provides the highest incentive to the\nentrepreneurs investing in regions outside the extended BMR and the ten adjacent provinces,\ncovers a large geographical area, and thus becomes ineffective to make a desired impact on\nspecific areas. Regulatory constraints, such as trade and labor barriers, pricing issues, and\nexchange control hinder cross-border economic activities. The poor state of infrastructure,\ninsufficient urban services and environmental management are other major obstacles to the\nexpansion of economic activities and improved quality of life in the border towns. The health\nand productivity of the urban population are threatened by the lack of safe water, and poor solid\nwaste management and drainage systems. Urban growth is taking place in an ad hoc manner,\nparticularly in those areas where border check points and markets are located. Development is\nconstantly undermined by lack of coordination between urban institutions, the fragmented\nnature of the urban administration structure, 2 limited power, and inadequate capacities of local\ngovernments in urban management and resource mobilization. Despite the Government's\nadministrative decentralization policy and local governments being formally mandated to\nprovide most urban services, the centralized fiscal pattern of the country prevents local\ngovernments from raising and having access to the required funds for their tasks. These towns,\nwith their present capacity, are not prepared to cope with the pressure of the growth already\nbeing experienced.\n8. A wholistic approach and concerted efforts are imperative to harness the\ndevelopment potential of border towns and make them an effective means of physically\nbalanced and equitable urban development. There is a need to develop a comprehensive\npackage of development strategies for border towns linking the country's decentralization\nThe Ministry of Industry (MOl) has completed a study to develop models for the establishment of Special\nBorder Economic Zones in Mukdahan and Mae Sot. Government approvals of the Mukdahan and Mae Sot\neconomic zones are expected in October 1997. Further, a feasibility study was conducted by MOl for\nspecial economic zones in several districts including Betong and Tak Bal on the Malaysian border taking\ninto account the IMT-GT. Some border towns on the Malaysian border are seen as having considerable\npotential to attract some industrial activities from northern Malaysia.\n2 There are sometimes several rocal administrations responsible within the same urban area or urban\nagglomeration such as in Sadao district where there are the Sadao municipality, Sadao Subdistrict Tambon\nAdministrative Organization, and Pedang Besar Sanitary district.", "4\nprocess to subregional cooperation efforts. Interventions in urban development to be based on\nthe overall strategy should focus on providing adequate infrastructure and service facilities to\nenhance the economic performance of border towns and urban services for the growing\npopulation. Policy and institutional constraints to urban development need to be addressed\nalong with a comprehensive capacity-building program for local governments to ensure\nsustainable urban development. The TA is needed to prepare an overall development strategy\nand an investment package for urban development in selected border towns.\nIll.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n9. The aim of the TA is to prepare a Project that will support the creation of an\nimproved physical, policy, and institutional environment in selected border towns. The Project is\nintended to help the Government in its decentralization efforts to achieve the ultimate objective\nof equitable. efficient, and sustainable urban development.\nB.\t Scope\n10. The scope of the TA will comprise preparation of (i) a strategic framework and a\ncomprehensive package of development strategies, including (a) an assessment of the\ndevelopmental roles of border towns in light of resource endowments, locational advantage\nand policies and programs on decentralization, and opportunities emerging from subregional\ncooperation; (b) selection of towns and assessment of constraints to productive capacity as well\nas the potential for development; (c) strategic investment areas in both private and public\nsectors, and forecasts of future growth; and (d) a set of strategies in priority sectors,\ninfrastructure, policy, regulatory, financial, and institutional terms; and (ii) an investment\npackage for improving infrastructure, urban services, and management in selected border\ntowns, including (a) detailed feasibility studies and preliminary cost estimates; (b) social,\nfinancial, economic, and environmental analyses for Project components; and (C) Project\nproposals and implementation arrangements.\n11. The TA will take into account the earlier Bank TAs on decentralization and\nsubregional cooperation. Coordination will be maintained with the ongoing projects undertaken\nby the Bank, the Government, and other aid sources. The TA will incorporate a participatory\napproach. A total of ten towns will be selected for detailed study at a tripartite meeting at the\nend of the first month. It is envisaged that the ensuing Project will comprise investments based\non the strategic framework, and on the specific needs of each town in infrastructure and urban\nservices such as wastewater treatment, solid waste management, drainage, sanitation, water\nsupply, basic services for the urban poor, transport infrastructure and services, economic\ninfrastructure such as industrial sites, markets, and capacity building of local governments.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The estimated cost of the TA is $1,000,000 equivalent comprising a foreign\nexchange cost of $467,000 and a local currency cost of $533,000 equivalent. The Bank will\nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $333,000 equivalent of the local currency cost,\ntotaling $800,000 equivalent, on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the\nGovernment of Japan. The Government contribution of $200,000 equivalent covers the", "5\nremuneration of counterpart staff, office accommodations, surface transportation for counterpart\nstaff, and counterpart funds for part of the workshop activities. The details of the cost estimates\nare in Appendix 1. The Government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit the\nBank to financing any ensuing project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n13. The Center for Integrated Plan of Operations (CIPO) of the National Economic\nand Social Development Board, the key central planning agency, will be the Executing Agency\nfor the TA. CIPO, with its high caliber staff, is specifically assigned to undertake integrated\nplanning studies, planning and implementation of regional development, and specific area\ndevelopment programs of national concern. The overall guidance for the TA will be provided by\na steering committee composed of representatives of the Ministry of Interior, Fiscal Policy\nOffice, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, and local\ngovernment representatives in the Project towns. The TA will be implemented over an eight-\nmonth period from February 1998 to October 1998, and will include workshops to discuss the\ninterim and draft final reports with all stakeholders, including beneficiaries and nongovernment\norganizations. CIPO will provide a TA coordinator, counterpart staff equivalent to about 70\nperson-months, support staff, office space, and facilities and local transportation for counterpart\nstaff in Bangkok and the border towns. CIPO wilt be responsible for coordinating, steering, and\nmonitoring the counterpart activities.\n14. The TA will be undertaken by a consulting firm recruited in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank\non the engagement of domestic consultants. About 48 person-months of consulting services wiU\nbe required, includingabout 16 person-months of international and 32 person-months of\ndomestic specialists. The team will comprise international experts in development\nplanning/economics, urban development, municipal engineering, and economic and financial\nanalysis: and domestic experts in development planning/economics, industry/finance,\nengineering, urban planning and management, local governance/finance, and sociology. The\noutline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 2.\n15. By the end of the first month after commencement of services, the consultants\nwill submit an inception report including the description of the scope, approach, work program,\nconfirmation of the selection of towns, and preliminary analyses. An interim report containing\nthe strategic framework for border town development, and prefeasibility studies of the Project\ncomponents will be submitted after the fourth month, and a draft final report describing the\nscope, implementation arrangements, and the feasibility of the Project components seven\nmonths after the commencement of the TA. Tripartite meetings will be held with the\nGovernment, the Bank, and the consultants to discuss the TA reports. A final report will be\nsubmitted one month after comments on the draft final report are made by the Government and\nthe Bank.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Kingdom of\nThailand in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 for the purpose of the Border\nTowns Urban Development Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n6\nAppendix 1\nCOST ESTiMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'OOO)\nItem\t Foreign\t Local\t Total\nExchange\t Currency\t Costs\nA.
