I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  additional  financing  of  the  Flood  Damage  Emergency \nReconstruction Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided by the Government of Australia for the additional financing of the project, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the grant for the additional financing.1  \n2.  The additional financing to the project includes four outputs to restore key infrastructure \ndamaged by the 2013 floods that affected 20 of Cambodia\u2019s 24 provinces: (i) national and \nprovincial roads rehabilitation, (ii) rural roads rehabilitation, (iii) irrigation rehabilitation and flood \nmanagement, and (iv) project management and facilitation. The project covers six severely \nflood-affected provinces: Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, \nOddar Meanchey, and Siem Reap.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Current  Flood  Damage  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project.  In  2012,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approved the Project to enable economic and social recovery and \nrestore key infrastructure damaged during the 2011 floods, caused by exceptionally heavy rains, \nwhich affected 18 of Cambodia\u2019s 24 provinces.3 The scope included (i) national and provincial \nroads restoration, (ii) rural roads restoration, (iii) irrigation and flood control, and (iv) project \nmanagement. By the end of February 2014, overall progress was estimated at 65% against the \nelapsed time of 55%. Cumulative contract awards of the combined loan and grant were $55.2 \nmillion, equivalent to 93% of the total project amounts; cumulative disbursements were $31.2 \nmillion, 52% of the total project amounts. \n \n4.  The project is performing well based on the criteria stated in ADB\u2019s Additional Financing \nPolicy: 4 (i) the strong capacity of the Ministry of Economy and Finance to coordinate and \nimplement the project and achieve the intended outputs and outcome without any major delay, \n(ii) strong contract award and disbursement records against projections, (iii) compliance with \ncovenants  including  safeguards,  and  (iv)  successful  management  of  risks  through \nimplementation of the risk assessment and risk management plan. The project performance is \ncurrently on track. \n \n5.  Need for Additional Financing. Cambodia experienced serious flash floods from late \nSeptember to mid-October 2013. The damage to infrastructure was similar to that caused by the \nfloods in 2011. However, the floods were more intense and sudden, caused by heavy rainfall \ncombined with runoff from Thailand into Cambodia\u2019s northwestern provinces. Twenty of the \ncountry\u2019s  24  provinces  were  impacted,  168  deaths  recorded,  and  over  1.7  million  people \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Information on assistance of other development partners is given in Development Coordination (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The Government is expected to cover the longer-term infrastructure \nconstruction expenses of the remaining provinces from their own budget allocation.  \n3  The Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project was approved on 27 March 2012 and became effective on \n14 May 2012, with a loan closing date of 30 September 2015 in the amount of SDR35,347,000 ($55 million \nequivalent) from the Asian Development Fund. The Government of Australia provided a grant of A$5.00 million \n($5.25 million equivalent), while the government contributed $6.93 million equivalent. \n4  ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/OP. Manila. ", "2 \naffected (about 10% of the national population). The damage from the 2013 floods, compared to \nthe events in 2011,5 appears to have been less extensive in scale, yet in some provinces the \nflood impact was more significant than in 2011 because of a combination of factors such as the \nunexpected severity of the floods, the longer time it took for waters to recede, repeated floods \nand flash floods, limited preparedness, and limited early warning. According to the National \nCommittee for Disaster Management, 45,905 households had to be evacuated, although many \npeople have since been able to return. More than 240,195 houses, 1,254 schools, 92 health \ncenters  and  hospitals,  and  533  pagodas  have  been  affected,  with  sizeable  infrastructure \ndamage, including 440 kilometers (km) of national roads and 3,569 km of rural roads. More than \n126,925 hectares of transplanted rice and 57,443 hectares of other crops were damaged, \nrepresenting about 8% of the total cultivated area. \n \n6.  The government has requested ADB to provide urgent assistance to support relief, \nrehabilitation, and reconstruction of infrastructure arising from flash floods.6 ADB approved a \ngrant  of  $3  million  to  Cambodia  under  the  Asia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Fund  on  14 \nNovember 2013. Given the similar nature of damage, the emergency, and the implementation \nmechanisms in the current project, additional financing to the existing emergency assistance \nloan is the most suitable response to the flood emergency. This would (i) maximize synergies \nand the response impacts, (ii) take advantage of the lessons from the 2011 flood response to \nspeed  up  emergency  actions,  and  (iii)  utilize  the  existing  implementation  structures  and \ncapacities to achieve faster disbursements and implementation.7 \n \n7.  Damage,  loss,  and  needs  assessment.  ADB  closely  cooperated  with  the  United \nNations Development Program to assist the government to conduct a post-floods early recovery \nneeds assessment, measuring the extent of the damage and providing a framework for recovery. \nThe assessment was completed in late January 2014. Total damage and losses to all assets \nand public infrastructure, including roads (national, provincial, and rural), irrigation facilities, \nwater supply and sanitation facilities (mostly small-scale rural), schools, and health centers were \nestimated at $356 million. \n \n8.  Government response. The government\u2019s immediate budget response to the crisis in \n2013\u20132014 amounted to $24 million, which is far below the $118 million required for short-term \ninfrastructure recovery needs estimated in the Post-Floods Early Recovery Needs Assessment \nReport. Government fully expects to cover the rest of the longer-term infrastructure construction \nexpenses from its own budget allocation, other related infrastructure projects, and assistance \nfrom development partners. \n \n9.  Flood impact response framework. As a framework for structuring the project activities, \nthe restoration of flood-damaged infrastructure may be divided into three stages:  \n(i)  Stage  1.  Immediate  repairs  to  reestablish  use  of  the  infrastructure  on  a \ntemporary basis and restore communications. The most urgent work has been \nimplemented by the government using its own resources, and therefore ADB \nsupport will focus on stages 2 and 3. \n(ii)  Stage 2. Fast-track repairs where it is necessary to restore functionality before \nthe next wet season to secure the existing (undamaged) works and thus avoid \n                                                \n5  In 2011, the floods affected 18 provinces and about 1.5 million affected people, and caused 250 deaths. The \ndamage to infrastructure and agricultural crops was estimated at about $500 million.

Urgent  preparation  of \npackages under this stage is the current emphasis of the line ministries.  \n(iii)  Stage 3. Complete flood damage restoration over the following two dry season \nconstruction  periods  (2015  and  2016).  Flood  capacity  of  key  structures \n(especially spillways) will be upgraded and improved and operational plans and \ncapacity will be reviewed. A hydrological review, taking into account climate \nchange  projections  and  impacts,  will  be  implemented  to  update  flood  flow \nestimates for improving design capacity of key infrastructure to support enhanced \nflood management planning and operations. The measures will reduce risks from \nfuture flooding. Design adjustments will also reflect lessons from implementation \nof the Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project. \n  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the project is economic and social recovery from the 2013 floods in the \nproject  provinces  accelerated.  The  outcome  of  the  project  is  reconstruction  of  critical \ninfrastructure to restore livelihoods and access and protect against future flooding. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  Given the extent of the infrastructure damage and the limited resources available, the \nproposed project prioritizes specific areas and sectors, and infrastructure rehabilitation will be \nconducted in two stages\u2014stage 2 and stage 3. \n \n12.  Output 1: National and provincial roads rehabilitated. This project output will include \nreconstruction of flood-damaged national and provincial roads in five provinces. In Kampong \nCham, one bridge along provincial road 270, which was severely weakened by the floods, will \nbe replaced and 16.19 km of national road 70 will be reconstructed. In Banteay Meanchey, 25.0 \nkm of provincial road 156D and 24.8 km of provincial road 2563 will be repaired and upgraded, \nand two bridges replaced. In Kampong Thom, 8.15 km of provincial road 264E and 7.50 km of \nprovincial road 264D will be reconstructed. In Siem Reap, 11.3 km of provincial road 265F and \n6.0 km of national road 63 will be reconstructed. In Battambang, 19.7 km of provincial road 1570 \nwill be reconstructed. Stage 1 works have already been completed under government funding to \nrestore minimum function of national and provincial roads.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Rural roads rehabilitated. There has been extensive damage to many rural \nroads as a result of the floods such that lifelines, particularly in project areas, were cut off. The \nhighest priority stage 2 works comprise 115 km of rural roads, to benefit 125,414 people in the \nselected  provinces,  by  rehabilitation  of  damaged  surface  and  structures.  Stage  3  works \ncomprise 142 km of rural roads, to benefit 158,993 people, through improvements for reliable \nand more efficient access between rural communities and markets. Improved traffic flow and \nefficient communications will lead to reduced fuel consumption. These roads were selected from \nthe five priority provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, \nand Siem Reap. The stage 3 roads involve upgrading of a subset of the stage 2 roads, and are \nselected based on priority requirements for improvement and long-term climate resilience. \n \n14.  Output 3: Irrigation rehabilitated and improved flood management. At least nine \nflood-damaged irrigation schemes covering about 37,500 hectares will be rehabilitated and \nimproved  in  five  provinces\u2014Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  Kampong  Thom,  Oddar \n ", "4 \nMeanchey, and Siem Reap.8 Stage 2 works will involve urgent rehabilitation to restore service \nfunctionality for implementation during the 2014 dry season. Stage 3 works will be upgraded \nwith infrastructure improvements, to be implemented during the 2015 and 2016 dry seasons. \nCivil works and development of hydromet capacity will increase future flood resilience and \ncontribute  to  mitigation  strategies  to  lower  risk  arising  from  climate  change. 9 The  pilot \ndevelopment of a hydromet system in three river catchments will form the basis for improved \nflash flood forecasting capacity in western catchments.10 When complete, it will provide real-\ntime data to support the implementation of a strategic flood management plan and mitigate \nrecurrent flood risks emanating from large flows in those catchments that impact water storages \nand  infrastructure.  The  hydromet  equipment  will  be  complementary  to  the  strategic  water \nmanagement plan, being developed under ADB\u2019s program.11  \n \n15.  Output 4: Project management and facilitation. This output will support the Ministry of \nFinance, as executing agency, in overseeing and managing the project. It will be supported by \nconsultants  to  ensure  that  fiduciary  and  safeguards  procedures  are  followed  and  that \nimplementation schedules are kept on track. Consulting services will be provided to assist the \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies with project management support as well as \nassistance with the coordination and development of a cross-sector flood management strategy \nfor the affected areas. \n \nD.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Water Resource Management Sector Development Program. Manila. \n ", "5 \n17.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR48,545,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project.12 The loan will \nhave  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per  annum  (interest  during  construction  to  be \ncapitalized in the loan), a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with repayment \nof principal at 2% a year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. The government will \ncontribute  to  safeguards  costs,  salary  supplements  for  staff,  and  external  independent \nmonitoring, and will bear the costs of taxes and duties in the total amount of $9.00 million \nequivalent (Table 2).13 The Government of Australia has confirmed its intention to provide a \ngrant of A$7.60 million, equivalent to $6.68 million at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of \nfact  finding;  it  will  be  denominated  in  US  dollars  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  standard  accounting \npractice.14 The Government of Australia financing will be front-loaded for civil works. \n \nTable 2: Project Financing Plan  \n  Currenta  Additional Financing  Total \nShare of  Share of  Share of \nAmount  Total  Amount  Total  Amount  Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%)  ($ million)  (%)  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  55.00  82  75.00  83  130.00  82 \nGovernment of Australia  5.25  8  6.68  7  11.93  8 \nGovernment of Cambodia  6.93  10  9.00  10  15.93  10 \nTotal  67.18  100  90.68  100  157.86  100 \na Refers to the original amount and any previous additional financing. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nE.

Detailed implementation arrangements are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (PAM).15 Since the additional financing will be \ncofinanced by Asian Development Fund resources and by the grant from the Government of \nAustralia, which will be administered by ADB, universal procurement will apply to procurement \nof goods, works, and services (including consulting services) for the additional financing.16 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2014\u2013March 2017 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2017 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project Management Coordination Committee \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (chair) \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport,  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology \n(members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(iii)  Key implementing  Ministry of Public Works and Transport for output 1 \n                                                \n12 The ADB loan may finance local transportation, insurance, and recurrent costs to facilitate project implementation, \nand taxes and duties for incremental administration costs. \n13 Except taxes and duties on incremental administrative costs that will be financed by the ADB loan. \n14 This amount may be adjusted for currency fluctuations to match the grant amount received by ADB. \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Board document R29-13: Blanket Waiver of Member Country Procurement Eligibility Restrictions in Cases of \nCofinancing for Operations Cofinanced from Asian Development Fund Resources, approved on 18 March 2013. \n ", "6 \nAspects  Arrangements \nagencies  Ministry of Rural Development for output 2 \nMinistry of Water Resources and Meteorology for output 3 \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Phnom Penh PCMU: 10 staff; PIU (3): 10 staff at each PIU plus two \nsite engineers and provincial focal points in each project province \nProcurement  ICB  2 contracts  $10.30 million \nNCB  17 contracts  $39.08 million \nDirect contract  13 contracts  $17.02 million \nShopping  4 contracts  $0.34 million \nConsulting services  ICS  159 person-months  $0.57 million  \nContract variations  877 person-months  $6.50 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  For eligible expenditures incurred after 30 September 2013, but not \nadvance contracting  earlier than 12 months before the date of the loan agreement or \ngrant agreement, and to a maximum of 30% of the loan and grant \namounts \nDisbursement  The ADB loan and Australian Aid proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, ICS = individual consultant selection, NCB \n= national competitive bidding, PCMU = project coordination and monitoring unit, PIU = project implementation unit.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.  Advance  action  and  retroactive  financing.  To  ensure  that  project  activities  are \ncompleted  before  the  onset  of  the  wet  season  (July  2014),  stage  2  works  will  need  to \ncommence before loan effectiveness. The government has requested retroactive financing be \nused to secure consulting services and stage 2 procurement packages. Retroactive financing \ncan apply to eligible expenditures incurred after 30 September 2013, but not earlier than 12 \nmonths before the date of loan or grant agreement, provided the project coordination and \nmonitoring unit (PCMU), assisted by consultants, certifies the expenditures and that certification \nis acceptable to ADB. In principle, retroactive financing approval will be sought for the initial \ncosts of consultant recruitment and the procurement of stage 2 civil works contracts. Details on \nprocedures for retroactive financing and advance actions are in the PAM. The government has \nbeen advised that approval of advance action and/or retroactive financing does not commit ADB \nto finance any part of the project. \n \n20.  Procurement. Stage 2 contracts will be awarded under direct contracting, using those \ncontractors that performed well under the Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project, \nsubject  to  following  relevant  prior-  and  post-review  processes.  Procedures  are  to  be \ndocumented in each component\u2019s procurement plan. Stage 3 contracts are expected to start \nafter the 2014 wet season. Competitive procurement procedures will be followed for all stage 3 \nproject packages. Civil works packages of less than $4 million may be procured using national \ncompetitive  bidding,  with  international  competitive  bidding  for  larger  packages,  as  per \nprocedures outlined in the procurement plans.

This will be updated for the additional financing. \nThe  data  will  be  disaggregated  by  income  levels,  gender,  and  ethnicity.  The  PCMU  and \nimplementing  agencies  will  continue  to  monitor  and  ensure  the  compliance  of  loan \nassurances\u2014policy, legal, financial, safeguards, and gender. The Flood Damage Emergency \nReconstruction Project midterm review confirmed that monitoring and evaluation requirements \nare being completed, including adherence to safeguards. Further details are provided in the \nPAM. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Standard economic and financial assessments will be undertaken for all subprojects \nunder  the  investment  packages  in  stage  3.18 All  project  investments  are  expected  to  be \neconomically viable. The economic internal rate of return for all stage 3 subprojects is expected \nto be greater than 12%.19 Stage 3 subprojects will restore basic infrastructure and, in the \nprocess, improve the welfare of affected people and businesses. The investments will improve \nconnectivity as well as trade, agriculture production, and access to social services. \n \nB.  Governance \n24.  Public financial management.  The government has embarked on a Public Financial \nManagement Reform Program since 2004 and the public financial management system is being \ndeveloped, but improvements are needed to achieve full accountability in public expenditures. \nThe  2010  Public  Expenditure  Financial  Accountability  Assessment  indicates  mixed  but \nimproving performance. An update assessment in 2012 was that the program implementation \nwas overall on track. ADB has also supported capacity building for three rural development \nministries  in  budget  preparation  and  execution,  financial  management  and  accounting, \nprocurement, internal audit development, and monitoring and evaluation.20 All three ministries \nhave made gradual improvements in these areas. In addition, the grant has also supported the \nNational Audit Authority to strengthen its capacity in audit of externally funded projects. The \nNational Audit Authority has been progressively improving external audit scrutiny of government \nexpenditures and revenues, borrowings, and assets. \n \n                                                \n18  Economic and financial analysis were not undertaken for Stage 2 subprojects due to urgent repairs to restore \nfunctionality before the next wet season to avoid further damage to the undamaged works. The incremental \nreturns are expected to far exceed the costs, given that without urgent repairs the structure would be lost \naltogether in the coming rainy season. \n19  The average economic internal rate of return for stage 3 subprojects of the original project was 34%. \n20  ADB. 2009.

Three rural \ndevelopment  ministries:  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries;  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and \nMeteorology; and Ministry of Rural Development. \n ", "8 \n25.  Procurement.  The  procurement  assessment,  drawing  on  procurement  diagnostic \nstudies, indicates limited recent progress. Significant domestically financed procurements occur \nthrough noncompetitive and informal procedures. Even though the Public Procurement Law was \nadopted in January 2012 and the Anti-Corruption Law was adopted in 2010, implementation \nprogress is limited and the risk remains high. The updated Standard Operating Procedures, \nProcurement Manual, and Financial Management Manual for Externally Assisted Projects have \nbeen applied to projects financed by ADB and other development partners.21 The manuals \nconsist of the identification of mitigation measures designed to reduce the risk and improve the \nefficiency and effectiveness of management and administration of the portfolio of externally \nassisted projects. \n \n26.  Anticorruption.  The  anticorruption  assessment  identifies  that  the  Public  Finance \nSystem Law (2008), strengthening the Penal Code for Corrupt Offenses (2009), and the Anti-\nCorruption Law (2010) have been adopted. Institutional work is focusing on early development \nof  the  Anti-Corruption  Unit  provided  under  the  Anti-Corruption  Law.  However,  corruption \nremains  a  major  issue  and  poses  significant  constraints  on  development  effectiveness  in \nCambodia. ADB support to improve sector governance through improvement of the financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  systems,  implementation  of  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan at the project level, and improved local accountability through support for \ndecentralization initiative is expected to further improve the governance environment.  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the executing agency and implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements and \nanticorruption measures are described in the PAM. \n \n28.  Complaints redress mechanism. The executing agency and implementing agencies \nwill set up grievance redress mechanisms with outreach for all subprojects funded by ADB. The \ngrievance and complaints mechanism will be posted publicly on the project website.   \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The 2013 floods exacerbated poverty and vulnerability with a particularly long period of \ninundation that seriously disrupted livelihoods and damaged infrastructure, particularly roads \nand irrigation. Damaged roads hamper physical access to markets, goods, and services, and \ndamaged irrigation hinders agricultural production. In the wake of the 2011 floods, studies found \nthat a large proportion of affected households had taken out loans to cope with the negative \nimpact  of  the  floods,  and  that  loans  were  primarily  taken  to  meet  food  needs.  Poor  and \nvulnerable families can very easily get trapped in a vicious cycle of overindebtedness, which \nmakes the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure all the more urgent so that productive \nactivities can be resumed as soon as possible. Restored infrastructure will have clear direct \nbenefits for poor and vulnerable flood-affected rural households. The emergency restoration of \nrural roads has been given the highest priority under the project, since these are rural residents\u2019 \nlifelines. Other direct benefits will come from the construction jobs created and the cash income \nthey generate. \n \n30.  Gender action plan. Rehabilitated national, provincial, and rural roads and irrigation \nfacilities will benefit women and men. To support the reestablishment of livelihoods, a gender \naction plan was developed to ensure that the executing agency, implementing agencies, and \ncivil works contractors pay particular attention to the inclusion of local unskilled laborers, and \n                                                \n21 Government of Cambodia. 2012. Standard Operating Procedures. Updated Version. Phnom Penh. \n ", "9 \nparticularly unskilled women, on reconstruction crews. Women who are able to access income \nfrom construction jobs will be able to contribute to rebuilding their families\u2019 lives. The 2011 ADB \nCountry Gender Analysis highlights that gender disparities in employment remain extensive in \nCambodia, primarily because of traditional attitudes about appropriate occupations for women \nand men.22 This is particularly true in the construction sector, where it is believed that women \neither cannot or do not wish to engage in manual labor. However, women are heavily engaged \nin manual labor in the agriculture sector, and social and gender analysis undertaken in the \ncontext of rural road improvement projects confirms their willingness and availability for such \nwork. The Ministry of Rural Development\u2019s Ready for Roads suite of training, monitoring, and \noutreach tools, developed in 2013, will be used to ensure that women are able to access at \nleast 25% of the unskilled work days created. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment. The project is deemed category B for environment. Subproject selection \ncriteria are formulated to avoid significant adverse environmental impacts. An environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF) was prepared in 2012 and updated in 2014, and \ndisclosed on 3 March 2014 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \ngovernment laws and subdecrees.23 The EARF includes environmental guidelines to mitigate \nimpacts during subproject design and implementation. The PCMU and project implementation \nunits (PIUs) will use experience gained from ADB-financed projects, and provide adequate \ncapacity  to  manage  environmental  impacts  with  consultant  support.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations and environmental management plans for stage 2 subprojects will be prepared \naccording to the EARF and will be incorporated into bidding and contract documents, with \nmonitoring  by  PIUs.  For  stage  3  subprojects,  initial  environmental  examinations  and \nenvironmental management plans will be prepared consistent with the EARF. Environmental \nreporting to ADB by the PCMU will be semi-annual.  \n \n32.  Social. The project is deemed category B for involuntary resettlement and category C \nfor indigenous peoples. Subproject selection criteria will minimize land acquisition, resettlement \nimpacts, and social risks.24 Resettlement framework was updated and disclosed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and government laws, regulations, and policies to guide \nplanning and design of subprojects.25 The PCMU and PIUs have gained safeguards monitoring \nexperience from the Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project, thereby ensuring the \nPIUs have the capability, with consultant support, to prepare resettlement plans. Consultation \nwill be undertaken with subproject stakeholders during implementation to ensure participation \nand disclosure as per resettlement framework section IV, Table 1. Responsibilities are identified \nfor each consultation and information disclosure activity. The executing agency will ensure a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  is  in  place  as  described  in  section  VI  of  the  resettlement \nframework. All consultation activities will be documented in the semi-annual monitoring reports \non social safeguards by the external monitoring organization for ADB. It has been confirmed \nthat there are no indigenous peoples in the subproject areas covered under the additional \nfinancing. \n                                                \n22  ADB. 2012.

Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major  risks  identified  were  in  procurement,  financial  management,  and  perceived \ncorruption.  The  project  will  implement  specific  actions  to  mitigate  major  risks  through  (i) \nsupporting executing and implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity for procurement \nand monitoring contractors\u2019 works, to avoid irregularities during bidding; (ii) strengthening the \ncapacity of the implementing agencies to improve financial management and internal control; \nand (iii) strictly monitoring and enforcing procurement procedures and contracts, and  improving \ntransparency through advertisements and disclosure of project information on executing agency \nwebsites. The complaint handling mechanisms developed under the original project will be \nused. Joint investigation of irregularities will be undertaken by the National Audit Authority and \nADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity. Other risks and mitigating measures are described \nin  detail  in the risk  assessment  and  risk management  plan.26 The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n34.  Communications.  A shared objective of the ADB\u2013government communication strategy \nis to build public awareness and recognition of the collaboration and its outcomes.27 ADB and \nthe  government  will  proactively  make  maximum  use  of  well-proven  communication \nmethodologies for raising awareness of the viability and credibility of the project, as well as \nother government activities in response to the 2013 floods. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan and grant documents. \n \n36.  Conditions for effectiveness. The grant agreement will have been duly executed and \ndelivered and become effective as a condition for the effectiveness of the loan agreement, and \nthe loan agreement will have been duly executed and delivered and become effective as a \ncondition for the effectiveness of the grant agreement, or arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nshall have been made for the fulfillment of those conditions within a period satisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR48,545,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  additional \nfinancing of the Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, with an
