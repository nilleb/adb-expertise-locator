INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) cluster will demonstrate good practice examples of civil \nsociety engagement through consulting services, partnerships, and building the capacity of civil \nsociety organizations (CSOs) and implementing authorities of developing member countries \n(DMCs) to engage more effectively on Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects for more inclusive \ndevelopment outcomes. The TA cluster is in line with ADB\u2019s corporate strategic directions and \nenables ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC) to help ADB \nregional departments and DMCs implement these directions.1 \n \n2.  ADB  has  recognized  CSOs  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  as  key \nstakeholders since the adoption of the policy on cooperation between Asian Development Bank \nand nongovernment organizations in 1998.2 In addition, strategic priorities defined in the ADB \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020 Action Plan reaffirm the policy commitment to enhanced \ncollaboration with CSOs, and call for their active participation in the design and implementation \nof projects, and in the monitoring of project activities and outputs.3 The proposed TA cluster is \nincluded in the 2017 SDCC results-based work plan approved by the vice president for Knowledge \nManagement and Sustainable Development. \n \n3.  Under Strategy 2030 (now under development),4 ADB is seeking to align its future \ndirections more closely with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by supporting DMCs \nthrough investments in human needs, infrastructure, and cross-border public goods to eradicate \npoverty and strengthen sustainable development.5 In responding to the changing development \nlandscape in the rapidly evolving Asia and the Pacific, ADB recognizes the importance of \nengaging more effectively with CSOs to ensure that its development services are inclusive and \ncontribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Experience shows that effective CSO participation \nhas not only improved the quality of ADB\u2019s development services, but has also substantively \ncontributed  to  increasing  their  inclusiveness  by  building  on  principles  that  place  people, \nparticularly the poor and marginalized, at the center of the development process. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The new development paradigm\u2014embedded in the SDGs, the United Nations Framework \non Climate Change (COP21), and the Addis Ababa development financing framework\u2014reflects \nthe emerging world view that civil society has an important role in development, and societal \ndevelopment challenges can be addressed only through a collaborative effort by government, civil \nsociety, the private sector, and official development assistance providers. The implication for ADB \nis that opportunities for supporting more and deeper collaboration with CSOs will increase as its \nDMCs pursue partnerships with CSOs in implementing the SDGs. ADB\u2019s current commitments \nand  policies  for  supporting  DMC  collaboration  with  CSOs  remain  relevant  and  will  be \nstrengthened to deepen collaboration throughout ADB operations. \n \n5.  In early 2016, the NGO and Civil Society Center (NGOC) reviewed the current state of \nCSO engagement in ADB policies and operations, in view of the regional and global trends and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 May 2017. \n2  ADB. 1998.

", "2 \nthe changing role of civil society in poverty reduction and sustainable development.6 In addition, \nlessons from TA for Civil Society Participation for Development Effectiveness concluded that \ndeeper CSO participation will improve development outcomes and increase the inclusiveness of \nprograms and projects, including by (i) increasing access to and the responsiveness of health, \neducation, and social protection services; (ii) accessing and leveraging the effects of infrastructure \ninvestments;  (iii)  improving  public  sector  governance  and  reducing  corruption;  (iv)  helping \nimplement sustainable natural resource management; and (v) improving economic inclusivity \nthrough  interventions  that  target  poverty.7 Also,  the  study  recommended  the  following:  (i) \ndemonstration pilots should be supported to deepen CSO engagement in selected DMCs that \nhave proactive CSO engagement policies and programs, (ii) sector and thematic groups should \ntake  the  lead  in  developing  partnerships  with  CSOs  and  support  results-oriented  CSO \nengagement in sector lending operations, (iii) country partnership strategies should integrate the \nnew  development  paradigm  on  the  role  of  CSOs,  and  (iv)  a  strategy  for  financing  CSO \nengagement in ADB operations should be developed. \n \n6.  The  TA  cluster  implemented  through  three  subprojects  will  support  DMCs\u2019  SDG \ncommitments for more inclusive development and the fostering of partnerships with civil society \nand development partners to strengthen development effectiveness. \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n7.  The proposed subprojects are strategically linked with a common overall objective. The \nTA cluster modality allows flexibility and better sequencing of TA activities that is aligned with \navailable funding, compared with the stand-alone TA modality. The TA cluster approach also \nallows for flexible expansion of successful outputs. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n8.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: delivery of inclusive development \nservices in selected DMCs improved (SDG 10).8 The TA cluster will have the following outcome: \nCSO participation in ADB operations strengthened.9 \n \n9.  Output 1: Capacity for effective civil society organization engagement in the design, \nimplementation, and monitoring of ADB projects improved. The TA cluster will seek a DMC-\nbased solution to enhance CSO engagement and identify areas for skills enhancement. A \ncapacity gap assessment of skills and knowledge on CSO cooperation will lead to (i) development \nof a learning program to build the capacity of DMC officials and CSOs on effective engagement \nin key sectors such as climate change, disaster risk management, gender, water, urban services, \nenergy, health, education, and social protection; and (ii) country-specific strategies, such as CSO \nengagement in fragile and conflict-affected situations. To improve the skills for enhanced CSO \nengagement of DMC project officials and CSOs, capacity building methods and outputs will \ninclude (i) classroom training and learning-by-doing (on-the-job training, mentoring, and cross-\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2016.

The TA aimed to increase civil society contribution in ADB operations and was \ncompleted in October 2017.  \n8  SDG 10.2: By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, \nsex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nlearning visits); (ii) networking and peer learning programs; and (iii) e-learning and blended-\nlearning courses. The TA cluster will also support regional capacity building through workshops \nand the use of appropriate information and communication technology (ICT) platforms. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Demonstration  activities  through  effective  civil  society  organization \nengagement conducted. TA cluster outputs will focus on ongoing and new ADB operations and \ncountry  assistance  strategies  using  gender-sensitive  and  inclusive  approaches.  New  and \nproposed  business  processes  and  innovative  engagement  models  for  enhanced  CSO \nengagement will be field tested in selected DMCs.10 The main activities include (i) collecting and \nsharing  information,  and  supporting  CSO  participation  in  achieving  the  SDGs  and,  where \napplicable,  Open  Government  Partnership  national  action  plans  and  other  institutional \nmechanisms for civil society\u2013government engagement; (ii) collecting and sharing information with \nADB country teams and government agencies on major CSO-led development programs in the \nparticipating  DMC;  (iii)  developing  CSO  country  assessments  and  ADB\u2013CSO\u2013country \ncooperation  action  plans  in  country  planning  activities;11 (iv)  incorporating  knowledge  and \nexpertise of CSOs through the establishment of regional and national advisory committees; (v) \nintegrating context-sensitive CSO engagement into the design of new loans and grants in the \nADB project pipeline; (vi) supporting the implementation of planned CSO participation in ongoing \nADB-financed projects through TA and capacity building; (vii) supporting ADB resident mission \noffices and project teams working with CSOs; (viii) demonstrating new engagement tools and \nprocesses with CSOs in ADB projects; (ix) identifying and implementing opportunities to leverage \nADB\u2013CSO partnerships on ADB projects; (x) supporting the involvement of CSOs in the design, \nimplementation, and monitoring of project activities and outputs; (xi) supporting CSO-participatory \nactivities to enhance the delivery of services to poor, vulnerable, and marginalized communities; \nand (xii) creating CSO advisory committees (national and regional) to support TA knowledge \ngeneration  and  sharing.  The  advisory  committees  will  facilitate  discussions  and  provide \nrecommendations to stimulate increased CSO engagement in ADB projects. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Knowledge  products  about  effective  civil  society  organization \nengagement in ADB operations generated and shared. The TA cluster will capture and \ndisseminate lessons and experiences of good practices involving CSO engagement in project \nplanning,  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring,  and  highlight  in-country  and  regional \nknowledge platforms. The knowledge products will demonstrate how CSO engagement enhances \nproject quality and promotes inclusive development. Capacity building and field testing of new \nbusiness processes will be undertaken under output 1, and enhanced CSO engagement models \nunder output 2. Lessons from these activities may be developed into e-learning courses and \nblended learning programs to be used as part of a continuous capacity development program. \nSpecial  attention  would  be  devoted  to  CSO  engagement  to  improve  inclusion  of  specific \nmarginalized and vulnerable groups in ADB operations. Practical grassroots CSO engagement \nparticipatory tools and techniques will be generated locally and lessons monitored and shared \namong local CSOs and project operational teams. The TA cluster will develop tangible knowledge \nproducts using ICT and other appropriate communication tools (e.g., printed materials may be \nused for knowledge dissemination where internet access to local communities is not available, or \nas appropriate to enhance the effectiveness of discussions, interactions, and dialogues). These \nknowledge products will be integrated into ADB country knowledge planning and use country \n                                                \n10  New business processes under development as part of ADB. 2014.

Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $1,400,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). Detailed cost estimates and financing \narrangements  will  be  presented  in  each  subproject  proposal  submitted  for  approval.  Cost \nestimates for subprojects will be based on assessments of the capacity of CSOs and governments, \nand the implementation requirements of the activities and outputs.12  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. The NGOC under the Thematic Advisory Service \nCluster of the SDCC will lead the overall implementation of the subprojects. Activities under each \nsubproject  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments,  including  resident \nmissions. Each subproject proposal will be submitted for approval to the director general of SDCC \nin accordance with the business process for knowledge and support TA cluster processing.13  \n \n14.  SDCC  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  consultants,  resource  persons,  research \nassistants, partner organizations, and advisory committees. It will organize workshops; attend \nseminars; and provide staff to support workshops, training events, and supervisory and subproject \ndesign  missions.  Advisory  committees  will  be  formed  as  needed  to  support  subproject \nimplementation.14 Additionally, because this TA cluster will demonstrate innovative ways for ADB \nto engage with CSOs, it will demonstrate new modalities that augment the usual consulting \ncontract arrangements, as stated in the ADB procurement procedures.15 \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  November 2017\u2013December 2020  \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank\u2014Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department (NGO and Civil Society Center) \nConsultantsa  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by \nIndividual (Outputs 1\u20133)  ICS  ADB \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = Individual Consultants System, NGO = nongovernment organization, TA = \ntechnical assistance.  \na  Outline terms of reference for consultants, including resource persons, will be included in the subprojects. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.

Consulting services. Individual consultants will be recruited to support implementation \nof outputs 1\u20133 under the specific subprojects. An estimated 22 person-months of international \nconsultant inputs (e.g., capacity building specialist and participatory engagement specialist) and \n175 person-months of national consulting inputs (e.g., CSO engagement writers, researchers, \nCSO communications and training materials developer, participatory engagement specialists and \nproject coordinator) are required to carry out activities under the TA cluster. Output-based and/or \nlumpsum contracts will be considered for all consulting services, but time-based contracts will be \nused as appropriate. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated project administration and/or \nstaff instructions. The estimated cost and requisite fields of expertise are indicative and estimates \nwill be finalized prior to the approval of each subproject. \n  \n17.  Knowledge partnerships. Knowledge partnership agreements (KPAs) are envisioned \nunder the subprojects. Relevant CSOs will be engaged through KPAs to facilitate the application \nof their localized experience and technical knowhow, implementation capability, and efficiency to \ngenerate knowledge and promote knowledge solutions in operations.16 A nomination proposal will \nbe prepared for a proposed knowledge partner, and the corresponding KPA will be processed, in \naccordance with the ADB staff instructions.17 \n \n18.  Social media and websites.

The TA cluster approach also \nallows for flexible expansion of successful outputs and alignment of donor funding with subproject \ndesign. Three subprojects are envisioned to deliver activities and outputs individually that will \ncontribute to the TA cluster outputs; these subprojects will collectively deliver the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). The tentative scope of the subprojects is outlined below. \nDetails of subproject 2 and subproject 3 would be shaped by the subproject 1 implementation \nexperience, expanded and aligned with resource availability, and in line with the innovation and \nlearning-by-doing approach undertaken in this TA cluster. \n \nSubproject 1  Deepening ADB-Civil Society Engagement in Selected \nCountries in Central West Asia, East Asia, and the \nPacific \nIndicative outputs and  Output 1: Capacity-building products and services for \nactivities  CSOs and government agencies on effective CSO \nengagement in ADB projects delivered.
