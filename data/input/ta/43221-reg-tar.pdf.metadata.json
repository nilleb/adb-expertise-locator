INTRODUCTION \n1.  Information and communication technology (ICT) serves as a mean to connect within \nand across government, business and communities; to handle complex business process; and \nto facilitate effective communication, interaction and innovation, which contributes to improving \nefficiency, transparency, and competitiveness. Because of this benefit, ICT has been applied to \nand integrated with a wide range of human activities. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nrecognized the importance of ICT for development in its ICT strategy in 20031 and in its long-\nterm  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020).2  ADB  has  responded  to  increasing \ndemands from its developing member countries (DMCs) by providing assistance in establishing \nICT infrastructure and by using ICT as a project component in various sector programs. This \nassistance  has  contributed  to  national  ICT  and  electronic  government  (e-government) \ndevelopment in DMCs. Despite some innovative features, however, the application of ICT is \noften  found  to  lack  the  prerequisite  preparatory  assessment,  a  realistic  road  map  for \ndevelopment, and appropriate skills and competence. This has led to a piecemeal approach in \nvarious  ICT  projects,  and  resulted  in  overlapping  efforts,  poor  information  sharing, \nincompatibility among different ICT applications, and failure to exploit synergies.  \n \n2.  To address these challenges, this regional capacity development technical assistance \n(TA)3  is  proposed  to  complement  ADB's  ICT-supported  sector  programs.  It  will  take  a \ncountrywide approach to enhance the capacity of concerned ministries and agencies in three \nfocus countries (Mongolia, Philippines and Viet Nam) in better applying ICT for national and \nsector  development.  These  three  focus  countries  have  the  highest  number  of  ADB  ICT-\nsupported projects, but the proposed TA will be beneficial to other DMCs. Implementation of the \nTA will be linked to ADB's strategies and business opportunities for the three focus countries. \nFact-finding missions in the focus countries were carried out in June and July 2009 to firm up \nthe impact, outcomes, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements \nof the TA, as reflected in this report. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.    ADB has experienced several challenges and learned various lessons in implementing \nvarious ICT-supported projects.  \n(i)  Although many DMCs have national-level ICT strategies or policies, the one for a \nsector-specific  ICT  or  e-government  is  often  lacking  or  inadequate.  Rapid \ntechnological progress and change in ICT makes continuous ICT improvement \nand  upgrading  inevitable  in  any  organization.  The  strategy  to  introduce  or \nimprove  ICT  should  depend  on  an  organization\u2019s  level  of  ICT  maturity,  and \nshould  aim  to  help  the  organization  increase  its  ICT  maturity  in  stages.  A \nmaturity-based  ICT  road  map  is  a  critical  starting  point  for  successful  e-\ngovernment projects, but these are rarely developed.  \n(ii)  Coordination among various development partners is often poorly organized and \nexecuted. ICT is most effective when operated as part of a networked system \nthat integrates data, business processes, and information from different offices, \n                                                 \n1 ADB.  2003.  Toward  E-Development  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific:  A  Strategic  Approach  for  Information  and \nCommunication Technology. Manila   \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. This strategy recognizes that insufficient ICT is depriving many economies of private investment and \nincluded communication as core infrastructure on which ADB should focus. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB website on 10 June 2009. \n ", "2  \nmeaning that the existence of appropriate institutional arrangements for effective \ncoordination and cooperation are vital.  \n(iii)  The introduction of ICT in government should entail changes in policies and \nprocesses, organizational changes across government institutions, and reforms \nto the mindsets and practices of government officials; it should not be limited to \nsimply  introducing  ICT  or  replacing  paper  with  digital  documents.  Significant \nresources and effort need to be directed to institutionalizing changed business \nprocesses, increasing the awareness of government officials, and building their \ncapacity for behavior change.  \n(iv)  Stakeholders  and  beneficiaries  often  lack  ICT  access,  and  have  limited \nappreciation  for  and  capacity  to  use  ICT  and  e-government  services,  which \nhighlights  the  importance  of  enhancing  ICT  accessibility  and  capacity  of \nstakeholders and beneficiaries.  \n(v)  Awareness building\u2014among both the general public and the private sector\u2014is an \nimportant facet of ICT development and implementation, and needs to focus on \nboth ICT supply and activities that create demand for ICT.  \n \n4.  Specific issues and challenges in the focus countries\u2014Mongolia, Philippines, and Viet \nNam\u2014are summarized below.  \n \n5.  In  Mongolia,  the  Government  is  committed  to  improving  administration  and  public \nservices through ICT. ADB has provided significant ICT components in various sector programs, \nincluding through three education sector projects, with aims that include (i) the integration of ICT \ninto pedagogy, curriculum and teacher training; and (ii) improved education sector management \nat provincial, district, and school levels using ICT. Two ADB health projects have used ICT to \nexpand  and  improve  rural  health  services  and  health  sector  management.  ADB  has  also \nassisted with customs modernization that seeks to improve customs management practices \nthrough the use of ICT. Although these projects have included some innovations, and produced \nresults on a sector or project level, the efforts are not properly coordinated or implemented under \na national framework. The Information Communications Technology and Post Authority was \nestablished in 2004 under the auspices of the Prime Minister as a coordinating and leading \nagency for  ICT policies and implementation in Mongolia. The Information Communications \nTechnology and Post Authority has drafted an e-government policy and framework but these \nhave remained in draft form for several years and urgently need to be finalized so that they can \nprovide guidelines and steps for various ICT applications developed by different ministries and \nagencies. \n \n6.  In the Philippines, the Government recognizes that ICT can improve the speed and \ndelivery of public goods and services, and result in greater transparency and efficiency in \ngovernment  operations.  In  this  regard,  the  government  has  been  engaged  in  national  e-\ngovernment development since 2000. The enactment of an e-commerce act in 2002 established \na major legal framework. Almost all of central and local government units has the website to \nprovide access to publicly available information. ADB has used ICT for several administrative \nreform and improvement projects, with the goal of increasing efficiency in financial management \nand  regulation  in  both  national  and  local  governments.  ADB  has  also  assisted  with  the \ndevelopment  of  electronic  procurement  services.  The  Commission  on  Information  and \nCommunications Technology has led and coordinated overall e-government development and is \nresponsible  for  ensuring  standards  and  interoperability  across  the  different  ICT  systems \ndeveloped by individual government units. The experience of the Philippines with e-government \nvaries significantly, and uneven progress between the central and local governments, and \nacross local governments, is a major challenge.    \n ", "                          3\n7.  In Viet Nam, the Government has made significant attempts to use ICT for development. \nThe World Bank has provided $110 million in assistance to the government of Viet Nam since \nSeptember 2006 to support ICT and e-government development. ADB's assistance in using ICT \nin sector programs has been significant. ADB has assisted the public administration reform \nprogram, and part of program targeted administrative simplification and modernization through \nICT.  In  education,  ADB  has  supported  the  introduction  of  ICT  in  classroom  teaching  and \nlearning, and development of an education information and management system. ADB has also \nassisted with the provision of agriculture technology and market information services through a \nweb portal site and mobile phones, and better resource management and planning through a \ngeographic  information  system.  The  Office  of  Government  formerly  coordinated  overall  e-\ngovernment efforts, but the Ministry of Information and Communications assumed this role in \n2007. Given this recent transition, further strengthening of the institutional and governance \nstructure  for  e-government  development  is  needed.  Although  there  is  an  e-government \ncommittee, the planning, development and approval process for ICT projects within ministries\u2014\nas well as inter-ministry coordination\u2014are weak. For example, the e-government standard and \nenterprise architecture, which was developed under the World Bank-funded project, was not \nfully  made  available  for  ICT  projects  in  other  ministries.  The  e-government  and  strategy, \ndeveloped by the Office of Government has not been further used by Ministry of Information and \nCommunications.  As  such  there  is  yet  official  e-government  framework  that  governs  ICT \nprojects in all government offices and ministries.    \n \n8.  These experiences and challenges demonstrate the urgency of enhancing the capacity \nto use ICT within government in a coordinated and organized manner, which involves a range of \nactivities, from policy formulation (e.g., national e-government frameworks and sector-specific \nICT road maps) to ICT project management in specific sectors. In this regard, the proposed TA \nwill enhance the required capacity of the government through the development of tools and \nprovision of learning programs both country-specific and regional-wise with a particular focus on \nMongolia, Philippines, and Viet Nam.   \n  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA aims to help improve the contribution of ICT in national and sector development \nby enhancing the capacity of the governments of Mongolia, Philippines, and Viet Nam. The TA \nwill  improve  the  knowledge,  skills  and  awareness  of  policy-makers,  line  ministries,  project \nmanagers, and other stakeholders in theses three DMCs to formulate, direct and/or implement \nICT policies and programs by applying appropriate ICT maturity assessment, participating in the \nlearning programs, and developing road map and strategies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will maximize existing knowledge and learning resources through partnerships \nand collaboration with notable development agencies such as the National Information Society \nAgency (NIA),4 which is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security \n                                                 \n4  NIA has been managing the Korea IT Learning Program, designed to promote international cooperation to build \nhuman capacity among developing countries, with the financial support of MOPAS. From 1998 to July 2008, NIA \norganized 180 learning courses, attended by 2,600 trainees from 106 countries. The main subjects cover current \ntopics related to information technology, such as national information policies, e-procurement, e-government \nsystem integration, telecommunication policies, and information security.  \n ", "4  \n(MOPAS) of the Republic of Korea, and the United Nations Asian and Pacific Training Centre \nfor ICT for Development (UN-APCICT).5 Given the complexity and high cost of many ICT \nprojects, it is important to learn from the experience of countries with more advanced ICT when \nimplementing various e-government projects. The Republic of Korea has been recognized as an \nexample of best practices and a rich source of ICT and e-government projects. With this \nbackground, ADB and MOPAS has a strategic partnership for ADB's DMCs in the field of ICT for \ndevelopment,6 and under this partnership framework, the MOPAS will contribute the financial \nand technical resources for this TA.  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  have  three  major  components:  (i)  study  of  e-government  maturity  and \npractices and road map development, (ii) development of an ICT project guidebook and online \nplatform, and (iii) learning programs.  \n \n12.  Component  1.  A  framework  will  be  researched  and  developed  that  consists  of  e-\ngovernment best practices and a maturity model. Based on the framework, the e-government \nmaturity of the governments of Mongolia, Philippines, and Viet Nam will be assessed, with a \nparticular  focus  on  those  sectors  where  ADB  provides  significant  assistance  (such  as \nadministration, education, agriculture, and finance). Based on the assessment results and the \nmaturity level of the particular government (i) an e-government and sector-specific ICT road \nmap will be developed; (ii) appropriate international and regional benchmarking practices will be \ncollected; (iii) associated capacity needs, gaps, and challenges will be identified, and a capacity \ndevelopment  plan  developed;  and  (iv)  business  opportunities  in  relation  to  ADB's  country \nstrategy and operations will be identified. In addition, case studies on e-government practices in \nthe three countries will be carried out. \n \n13.  Component  2.  The  ICT  project  guidebook  will  be  developed  for  ADB's  regional \ndepartments and the governments of ADB's DMCs, and broader external networks established \nby  UN-APCICT.  The  ICT  project  guidebook  will  consider  the  ICT  maturity  levels  of  each \norganization.  It  will  include  ICT  project  management  guidelines  (ranging  from  design, \nprocurement, management and implementation of ICT projects to monitoring and evaluation), \nsimple  maturity  assessment  tools,  standard  ICT  project  consultant  terms  of  reference,  a \nstandard template for requests for proposals, and other ICT project-processing tools that apply \nto various government sectors (e.g., administration, education, health, and agriculture). An ICT \nonline platform will be developed to share various ICT project products (applications, software, \npublications,  etc.)  within  and  across  the  countries,  including  products  funded  by  ADB.  In \naddition, all project outputs including good practice studies, country studies, local case studies, \nlocalized modules and programs will be made available online through enhancements to UN-\nAPCICT's  e-Collaborative  Hub,  and  Virtual  Academy.  An  appropriate  mechanism  will  be \nestablished to enhance, update and localize content on an ongoing basis, and to encourage \nparticipants to share knowledge through the online platform.   \n \n14.  Component 3. In the course of implementing components 1 and 2, the overall learning \nprograms  will  be  developed,  localized  and  provided  to  the  governments  of  participating \n                                                 \n5  UN-APCICT is a regional institute of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific \n(UNESCAP) and is mandated to build human and institutional capacity for ICT among UNESCAP member \ncountries. It has developed a comprehensive core ICT curriculum (the Academy of ICT Essentials for Government \nLeaders), supported national training institutes and government agencies in the region to rollout the Academy at \nthe national level, and facilitated networking among national Academy partners. \n6   ADB and MOPAS signed the letter of intent on 21 August 2009 for this partnership which aims to support (i) design \nand delivery of knowledge-sharing and human resource development programs; and (ii) provision of technical \nassistance and the carrying out of feasibility studies and policy consultations, among others. \n ", "                          5\ncountries. Existing national and regional ICT knowledge and learning resources\u2014including but \nnot limited to UN-APCICT's seven training modules of the Academy of ICT Essentials for \nGovernment Leaders and NIA's existing training programs\u2014will be collected and analyzed. The \nlearning program will include a program in the Republic of Korea and an in-country program: (i) \nthe Republic of Korea program will be implemented with the participation of representatives \nfrom Mongolia, Philippines, and Viet Nam and Korean resource persons who will share their \nexperiences and learn Korean experiences in e-government to increase general awareness of \nhigh-level government officials and policy makers of those three countries; and (ii) in-country \nprograms in Mongolia, Philippines and Viet Nam that will assist the governments in applying \nmaturity model and developing road map for their e-government and sector ICT developments. \nThe in-country programs will be provided in partnership with national ICT academies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $700,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund \nand administered by ADB, with $150,000 financed by the Government of the Republic of Korea \nthrough MOPAS\u2019 in-kind and cash contribution, and $50,000 financed by UN-APCICT through \nin-kind contributions. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  implementing  agencies  for  the  respective \ncountry components will be the Information Communications Technology and Post Authority in \nMongolia, the Commission on Information and Communications Technology in the Philippines, \nand the Ministry of Information and Communications in Viet Nam. Within the country, a project \nsteering  committee  will  be  established  comprising  representatives  from  concerned  line \nministries and agencies and chaired by the respective implementing agency. Within ADB, a \nproject advisory committee will be established comprised of the project officers of the concerned \nICT projects from the regional departments and resident missions, and coordinators from RSDD \nand  OIST,  to  provide  direction  and  supervise  project  implementation.  ADB  will  closely \ncollaborate with NIA and UN-APCICT in implementing the TA. Collaboration with ADBI and \nother specialized ICT-training institutes and other private sector partners will be pursued as \nnecessary and as relevant.   \n \n17.  The TA will require a total of 50 person-months of consultant services. The consultants \nwill have expertise in ICT and experience in e-government projects, will provide 8 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  42  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices, and will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will be implemented over 18 months, commencing in \nSeptember 2009. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for Improving \nPublic Services through Information and Communication Technology, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n ", "6   Appendix 3 \n     \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved sustainability  Number of ICT project  Progress, completion or  The government \nof ICT operation and  successfully supported and  evaluation reports of  officials in \nsuccess rate of ICT  used after the implementation  ADB-supported ICT  participating DMCs \nproject used by  as well as ICT project delivered  projects and other  are strongly \ngovernment for national  in time and budget with original  government ICT projects  committed to \nand sector  scope and objective to be met       applying the \ndevelopment        knowledge acquired \n    through training. \n   \n  Risk \n  Frequent changes in \ngovernment \npersonnel and \nresultant discontinuity \nof government \nofficials in project \nimplementation units. \n  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved knowledge,  Policy makers, project  ADB  project  completion  Key government \nskills, and awareness of  managers, and trainers in  report  officials in charge of \nICT of the governments  participating DMCs gain the    the relevant areas \nof participating DMCs   knowledge, skills, and  participate. \nappreciation needed to   \nformulate, direct and/or  Participants are well \nimplement ICT policies and  prepared and \nprograms.  committed to \ncontributing to \nknowledge sharing \nand capacity \ndevelopment. \n \nRisks \nLack of general ICT \nabsorptive capacity \nand specialized \ngovernment  \ntechnical capacity  \n \nLack of ownership \nand commitment on \nthe part of national \nICT academies to \nprovide training \nprograms to \ngovernments \n \n \n \n ", "                        Appendix 3  7\n    Data   \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nOutputs      Assumption \n1. e-government  Country-specific e-government  Project monitoring and  Strong stakeholder \nmaturity model and  maturity reports and road maps  progress reports  coordination and \npractices, and road  for Mongolia, Philippines, and    cooperation within \nmap development  Viet Nam  Consultant reports  and outside ADB in \n      carrying out TA \n  Report on e-government case  ADB review missions   activities  \n  studies and practices in     \n  Mongolia, Philippines and Viet  Steering committee   \n  Nam  meeting minutes \n     \n  Business opportunities for ADB    \n  in relation to ADB's country   \n  strategy and operations \n   \n2.
