INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will assist the Aid Accounts and \nAudit Division (AAAD)\u2014located within the Department of Economic Affairs in the Government of \nIndia\u2019s Ministry of Finance\u2014to strengthen its institutional capacity by streamlining public debt \nmanagement and funds flow operations. Streamlined functioning of the AAAD is essential for \nbetter management of development activities and projects. The TA aims to help \n(i)  re-engineer systems, upgrade information technology (IT) infrastructure, and \nautomate work processes related to external debt management;  \n(ii)  provide specialized training for AAAD officials; \n(iii)  provide capacity building and training of various stakeholders for better fund \nflows and loan covenant compliance; and  \n(iv)  study the existing fund flow process and identify ways it can be expedited and \nimproved. \n \n2.  The TA is in line with the country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), which includes capacity building of counterpart agencies as an important objective.1 A \nrequest from the government for institutional strengthening and capacity building of the AAAD \nwas received in October 2016, and therefore could not be included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2017\u20132019, which was released in October 2016; the TA is included in the 2017 \nannual work program of ADB\u2019s South Asia Department.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The infrastructure sector is a key driver of India\u2019s economy. The government has made a \nrecord allocation of \u20b93,961,350 million ($59.2 billion) for numerous infrastructure projects in the \nFY2018 Union Budget, which is expected to provide a significant boost to the economy. This is \nan almost 80% increase from the FY2017 allocation of \u20b92,212,460 million ($33.0 billion). To \nsupport  the  enhanced  infrastructure  expenditure,  the  government  is  undertaking  significant \ninitiatives to develop the required IT platform. Strong IT infrastructure can significantly improve \nthe efficiency of the government\u2019s internal business processes, while enhancing transparency, \naccountability and responsiveness. \n \n4.  AAAD\u2019s business processes are computerized, but other stakeholders have already \nimproved their workflow and business processes, thus requiring upgrading of AAAD\u2019s system to \nremove paper-based workflows that necessitate the physical exchange of documents.  The \nelectronic transfer of documents will save time, reduce transaction costs, promote process \nefficiencies, reduce errors, and avoid unnecessary processing delays. \n \n5.  Increased  infrastructure  investment  in  India  requires  faster  workflow  and  smooth \nbusiness processes. AAAD is responsible for maintaining comprehensive accounts of all the \nloans and grants obtained by the government from all external (multilateral and bilateral) funding \nsources, and is thus a key department requiring an enhanced IT infrastructure.2  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2018\u20132022. Manila. \n2  AAAD\u2019s functional activities are described in the Functions and Roles of the Aid Accounts and Audit Division of the \nDepartment of Economic Affairs (Supplementary Document 2, accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 3). \n ", "2 \n6.  AAAD  helps  administer  loans  and  grants  until  final  repayments  have  been  made. \nAAAD\u2019s  portfolio  is  increasing  each  year,  and  electronic  withdrawal  applications  for \ndisbursements  are  accepted  from  implementing  agencies  to  the  extent  possible.  As  of  7 \nNovember  2017,  AAAD  handled  over  1,350  projects  funded  by  multilateral  and  bilateral \nagencies.  This  is  expected  to  increase  further  in  support  of  India\u2019s  growing  infrastructure \ninvestments. AAAD relies heavily on IT for its daily operations, but the present systems are \nconstrained by inadequate IT infrastructure and resources. The Department of Economic Affairs \nrecognizes that AAAD\u2019s IT functions are in urgent need of upgrading\u2014the present IT system \nlacks useful functions, is hard to use, slow, and too inflexible to meet current business needs. \nOverall  disbursement  processing  and  accounting  activities  conducted  via  the  existing  IT \ninterface need to be improved. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  government  budgetary  administration \nsystem  digitally  and  economically  strengthened.3 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  \ncapacity of AAAD to manage business processes and funds flow for externally aided projects \nincreased.4  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Information technology systems for debt management modernized. A \nnew integrated computerized system (ICS) will be developed specifically for AAAD operations, \nincluding an advanced and upgraded reporting functionality, tracking audit compliance, and \nstrengthened  e-claim  submissions.  The  ICS may  support  options  to draw  dual  or  multiple \ncurrencies within a single loan or grant as considered necessary. An upgraded reporting module \nwill incorporate both standard and tailor-made reports with download features. The existing \nAAAD website will be modified and upgraded to incorporate new requirements and ensure it is \nintegrated with the ICS. The feasibility of creating interfaces between the upgraded ICS and IT \noriented application systems of  other stakeholders will also be reviewed and implemented \nwhere possible.  As needed, laptop computers, mobile access devices, network devices and \nother IT hardware will be procured under this TA, and will be turned over to the executing \nagency. \n \n9.  Output 2: Capacity building activities conducted for the Aid Accounts and Audit \nDivision. Workshops (one each on the updated training manual and the fund flow study findings, \nincluding  audit  compliance  for  various  government  stakeholders)  will  be  conducted.  One \ninternational study tour for AAAD officials will be organized to increase understanding of best \npractices in debt management. \n \n10.  Output  3:  The  functional workflow  document  for the  Aid  Accounts  and  Audit \nDivision updated. This document will detail the day-to-day processes\u2014e.g., disbursements, \ndebt servicing, coordination, and electronic data processing activities\u2014used by AAAD.   \n \n                                                \n3 2015, Government of India, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. 2015.

The study report aims to \nassess  existing  procedures  and  explore  potential  improvements  through  modernized  IT \ninterventions that enable taking timely actions. \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $725,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions.5  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  India  Resident  Mission  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating,  supervising  and  implementing  all  TA  activities,  including  recruitment  and \nmonitoring of consultants. The TA will be implemented from December 2017 to December 2020. \n \n15.
