During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government of People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide an advisory technical \nassistance (TA) for a study on Poverty Reduction in Grassland Improvement Program.1 It was \nsubsequently supported for funding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. The ADB Fact-\nFinding Mission visited the PRC from 16 October to 17 November 2003 to formulate the TA, and \nreached an understanding with the Government on the TA goals, purpose, cost estimates and \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Worsening degradation and desertification of grasslands, particularly in the dry and \nhighly fragile environments of the impoverished Western Region, seriously affect the welfare \nand livelihoods of nearly a quarter of the PRC\u2019s population. Grasslands cover about 40% (400 \nmillion hectares [ha]) of the PRC, mostly in the western region, which accounts for about 90% \nof total grasslands. The region includes a wide range of grassland ecosystems across a full \nelevation gradient, from cold alpine meadows to low-lying arid and semiarid rangelands, \nmostly  with  limited  social  infrastructure,  poor  communications,  and  a  harsh  climate. \nModerate to very severe land degradation occurs in nearly half the region with 27% of the land \neroded  by  wind  and  16%  by  water,  and  10%  undergoing  desertification.  Latest  estimates \nindicate that the desertified area has expanded to about 1.7 million square kilometers, or 18.2% \nof the total land area. The Development Research Center (DRC), the highly influential and \nleading PRC government think tank reporting directly to  the State Council, estimates direct \neconomic loss resulting from grasslands deterioration and desertification to be over CNY54 \nbillion or about $7 billion each year.2  \n \n3.  Economic  development  of  the  grasslands  largely  depends  on  their  unsustainable \nexploitation. Grasslands also have the highest number of poor people: against a national \naverage of 11% of the population living below the poverty line of $1 a day, poverty incidence \namong grassland-dependent people is estimated at 41 % in Xingjiang Uigur Autonomous \nRegion, 35% in Qinghai, and 18% in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. While the primary \ncause  for  grassland  deterioration  is  increasing  human  and  livestock  populations  and  the \nresulting overgrazing, natural disasters such as continuous droughts in 1999\u20132001 and locust \nattacks exacerbate the situation.  \n \n4.  Poverty reduction and sustainable management of natural resources are key objectives \nin the PRC\u2019s 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) and Poverty Reduction Strategy (2001\u20132010).3 \nThese objectives are expected to be included in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). In June \n1999 the Government officially launched the Western Region Development Strategy to (i) \nreduce economic disparities between the western and other regions, and (ii) ensure sustainable \nnatural resources management. The Government started to reverse environmental deterioration \nby introducing, among several other measures, tenure policies in 1988, under which herdsmen \n                                                 \n1\n  The TA first appeared in ADB Businesss Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 September 2003. \n2\n  DRC is a comprehensive policy research and consulting institution under the State Council, with over 170 research \nfellows. DRC, with its team of qualified experts and creative work, contributed greatly to central government \npolicymaking and has won fame at home and abroad. \n3\n  The 10\u2013year poverty strategy aims to identify key counties (about 600) for poverty reduction and assist 30 million \nrural people with less than CNY625 per capita annual income, and another 60 million rural people, considered \nvulnerable, with per capita annual income below CNY865. ", "2   \nwere granted 30\u2013year lease rights; and livestock-balancing policies in 1999, to regulate the \nnumber  of  animals  per  unit  of  grassland  and  limit  its  carrying  capacity.  The  grassland \nimprovement program (GIP) 2001\u20132010, developed with assistance from various development \npartners4 and supported by the 2002  Grassland Law,5 introduced  a  number  of  grassland \nmanagement  practices,  including  (i)  long-term  closures  to  allow  degraded  grasslands  to \nrecover, (ii) replacement of free herding by stall feeding, (iii) seasonal and rotational grazing, (iv) \nresettlement of herdsmen\u2019s households from desertified grasslands to better land where social \ninfrastructure is accessible, (v) conversion of croplands to grasslands and forests, (vi) aerial \nreseeding, (vii) provision of water for drinking and irrigation, (viii) application of fertilizers, (ix) \nshallow  or  zero-tillage  practices,  and  (x)  insect  pest  (locust)  control  and  other  technical \npackages. The program also includes subsidies for fencing, construction of livestock sheds, \nstorage facilities for hay, barns, reforestation and artificial grasslands (for forage production), \nand cash to affected households.  \n \n5.  These policies and the program have largely resulted in positive environmental impacts \nand ecological restoration of grasslands. Some socioeconomic costs, however, affect some \ncommunities\u2019 well-being. These unintended adverse impacts threatened the very premise of the \npolicies\u2014grassland  rehabilitation  leading  to  sustainable  ecosystems  and,  hence,  reduced \npoverty. For example, the grazing ban did not include creating sustainable alternative sources of \nincome for livestock owners and herdsmen, and subsequently reduced household incomes. \nAdverse impacts on affected communities led to further degradation of grasslands as the \ncommunities were left with few livelihood options except to continue to overexploit available \nresources. In Inner Mongolia, the rate of grassland degradation is estimated to be over 666,000 \nha. The problems\u2019 magnitude and severity make even the large investments in GIP appear \nmeager. The ecological and socioeconomic context of grassland ecosystems should be better \nunderstood, and the impacts of GIP and the factors that contribute to continuing deterioration \nappreciated.  The  relationship  between  poverty  and  sustainability  of  grassland  ecosystems \nshould also be better understood to facilitate identification of systems, cost-effective models, \nand enabling policies for sustainable management of grasslands to reverse their continuing \ndegradation and benefit affected people, especially the poor. This is particularly important \nbecause  the  subsidy-dependent  program  cannot  continue  indefinitely.  The  findings  of  the \nregional TA on  Prevention and Control of Dust and Sandstorms in Northeast Asia would be \nrelevant and useful to the analysis.6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4\n  These include the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) Grasslands Rehabilitation Project; \nCanadian International Development Agency (CIDA) Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Grasslands Project; \nWorld Bank Xingjiang and Gansu Grasslands Project, and poverty reduction projects in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, \nand Ningzia Hui; and Japan\u2019s Gansu and Inner Mongolia projects. \n5\n  This law was adopted at the Sixth National People's Congress on 18 June 1985. The law was revised to protect, \nconstruct, and ensure rational use of grasslands; improve the ecological environment; maintain biological diversity; \nmodernize animal husbandry; and promote sustainable development of the economy and society. The law was \nadopted at the 9th National People\u2019s Congress on 28 December 2002, and entered into force on 1 March 2003. \n6\n  ADB. 2002.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n6.  The  TA  purpose  is  to  (i)  assess  the  impact  of  GIP  policies  and  implementation \napproaches in the Western Region, focusing on impacts on the grassland ecology  and the \nlivelihoods of grassland-dependent communities; (ii) identify systems, cost-effective models, \nand enabling policies to manage grasslands; reverse grasslands\u2019 continuing degradation; and \nbenefit affected people, especially the poor, while ensuring sustainable resources and a stable \nenvironment; (iii) recommend changes in policies and programs that enhance social well-being; \nfacilitate economic development; address the adverse fiscal situation; and ensure sustainability, \nimplementation efficiency, and cost-effectiveness; and (iv) develop an effective monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) system, linked to the provincial and national poverty reduction M&E systems. \nThe TA will be in line with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (2004-2006) and focuses on, \namong other things, the growing rural-urban and east-west inequalities and environmental \nsustainability. The TA  will lay the foundation to improve the livelihoods of the rural poor by \nproviding the Government with a policy framework and a base to plan investments for grassland \nimprovement. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n7.  The TA scope complements the  framework of the PRC-Global Environmental Facility \nPartnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems.  In  summary,  the  study  outputs \ninclude (i) an overview and analysis of the linkages between poverty and degradation of \ngrasslands to determine the impact of current policies and programs in general and GIP in \nparticular on the ecology, sustainability, and socioeconomic well-being of affected communities; \n(ii) review and analysis of the objectives, policy framework, implementation arrangements, and \nstatus of GIP; identification of their strengths and weaknesses, particularly their effectiveness in \nachieving stated environmental and poverty reduction objectives as well as presenting their \neconomic and social impacts and fiscal implications; (iii) an overview of experience and lessons \nfrom local and international studies and projects on poverty reduction in grassland areas to \nidentify good practices and successful models for replication; (iv) development of a strategy and \ntime frame to improve the livelihood of grassland-dependent communities; and recommendation \nof appropriate and cost-effective models for sustainable management of grasslands, including a \nprogram for research and demonstration to continue improving these models based on (i) to (iii); \n(v) recommendations to adjust the GIP policy framework and implementation arrangements to \nensure  that  poverty  as  well  as  environmental  and  economic  concerns  are  equally  well \naddressed; (vi) an indication of the impact of the proposed policy changes on household \nincomes,  economic  development,  and  fiscal  implications;  (vii)  a  prioritized  implementation \nschedule of the proposed policy and GIP changes, taking into account their short-, medium-, \nand long-term social and environmental impacts and costs, the legal and institutional changes \nrequired, and the budgets required to implement the proposed changes; and (viii) design and \nimplementation plan for a single, efficient, and cost-effective M&E system for poverty reduction \nand GIP.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  Intensive involvement of, and interaction with, all stakeholders during TA implementation \nis required. During the inception of the TA study, a seminar will be held to explain the study\u2019s \npurpose and proposed activities and to present the consultants\u2019 work plan. The study team will \nensure that the concerns of, and the impact on, the rural poor are addressed when formulating \npolicies,  actions,  projects,  and  programs.  Particularly,  the  study  will  give  attention  to \nparticipatory  approaches  and  decentralized  initiatives  for  targeting  the  rural  poor  in  the ", "4   \ngrassland areas and enhance participatory and local planning processes, including community \nconsultations  and  incorporation  of  minority  issues  and  gender.  National  and  provincial \nworkshops and seminars will be held as required. A final seminar will present the study\u2019s \nfindings to a wide audience. \n \n9.  About six case studies and field surveys (rapid rural appraisals) will be undertaken in \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Ningxia and Gansu provinces, all in the Western \nRegion. These areas were chosen because they are priority areas for GIP interventions and \nsuffer severe poverty. Two counties per province will be selected based on, among other \ncriteria,  incidence  of  poverty,  representative  grassland  ecosystems,  predominant  livelihood \nincome from grasslands. The selected areas should cover different key GIP. Inclusion of Gansu \nand Ningxia provides a strong linkage between this important policy study and possible future \nlending. Since the two provinces are candidates for the provincial poverty reduction partnership, \nto be cofinanced with the Department for International Development (DFID, United Kingdom), \nfuture projects in the pipeline are possible, as are better opportunities to get more projects \nthrough the partnership. The case studies and surveys will assess the problems and issues with \npoverty and environmental degradation (including before and after) in important (proposed) \ngrassland programs, and help identify policies that will better reduce poverty. The case studies \nand surveys will also identify the environmental impact of the GIP, as well as assess their \neconomic and social impacts (including effect on household incomes), costs of implementation, \nand loss of revenue.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising $75,000 in \nforeign exchange, and $425,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis, equivalent to $400,000 covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $325,000 \nequivalent of local currency costs by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. By providing \ncounterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  support  facilities,  the  Government  will  finance  the \nremaining portion of the local currency cost. Details of the cost estimates and financing are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  DRC will be the Executing Agency. It will appoint a senior official as director of the TA \nstudy. Given the need to involve other ministries and organizations in TA implementation, a \nsteering  committee  (SC)  will  be  established  mainly  to  oversee  and  ensure  smooth  TA \nimplementation, and coordinate and enlist support of concerned agencies. The DRC vice \npresident will chair the steering committee. It will comprise senior officials representing DRC, \nState  Council  Leading  Group  Office  of  Poverty  Alleviation  and  Development,  National \nDevelopment  Reform  Commission,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  and \nrepresentatives of the provinces and autonomous region. The SC will have the option to invite \nrepresentatives  of  other  relevant  agencies,  concerned  provincial  officials,  and  other  key \nstakeholders to its meetings. Individuals with expertise relevant to the study may also be invited \nto  participate  in  SC  meetings.  Technical working groups  comprising  professional  staff  of \nrelevant agencies such as the State Forestry Administration, State Environmental Protection \nAdministration, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Gansu Grasslands Institute, and others \nwill be constituted by the SC to provide guidance and input to the consultants, review case \nstudies  and  reports,  and  recommend  changes  to  strengthen  policy  reforms.  An  advance \npayment facility will be provided to the Executing Agency to fund seminars and workshops. \n ", "    5 \n12.  TA  activities  are  described  in  Appendix  3.  The  TA  will  require  2  person-months \ninternational  and  12  person-months  domestic  consulting  services  for  policy  review  and \nformulation; and domestic expertise in (i) case studies, surveys, and rapid rural appraisal (4 \nperson-months); (ii) grassland rehabilitation and livestock management systems (5 person-\nmonths); (iii) poverty reduction in pastoral communities (4 person-months); (iv) gender and \ndevelopment  (2  person-months);  (v)  participatory  development  (3  person-months);  (vi) \ninstitutional arrangements and legislation (3 person-months); (vii) M&E (3 person-months); and \n(viii)  financial  assessment  and  fiscal  impact  analysis  (4  person-months).  The international \nexperts will help transfer knowledge and experience, specifically on environmental rehabilitation \nand poverty reduction policies, approaches, and techniques that may not yet be introduced to \nthe PRC. The international consultant will also help design and implement case studies and \nsurveys and prepare reports. The international consultant must have comprehensive experience \nin solving the problems to be addressed, and have adequate working experience in the PRC. \n \n13.  The consultants will be engaged as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. The consultants will be selected on the basis of simplified technical proposals and \nevaluated on the basis of the quality- and cost-based selection method. Provincial universities \nor  other  suitable  institutions  such  as  World  Wildlife  Fund  China  or  China  Council  for \nInternational Cooperation on Environment and Development, with experience in carrying out \nsimilar studies, may be contracted to undertake selected activities and/or field surveys. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over about 12 months, from March 2004 to March 2005. \nWithin 3 weeks after commencement, an inception report will be presented at a national \nworkshop  with  participation  of  the  SC,  technical  working  group,  concerned  development \npartners, consultants, and ADB. The inception report will include an implementation plan; a work \nprogram,  including  detailed  scope  of  work  for  each  consultant,  and  the  benchmarks  and \nmilestones  indicating  implementation  progress;  budget  requirements,  logistics,  timing,  and \norganization of field studies, data collection, case studies, seminars, and workshops; and an \nupdated TA framework. A midterm report will be presented at a tripartite meeting comprising the \nSC, consultants, and ADB, six months after services start. The draft final report will be also \npresented at the tripartite meeting one month before the TA\u2019s closing date (Appendix 4). The \ndraft final report will detail the TA outcome and demonstrate how it responds to achievement of \nobjectives. The final report will be submitted before the closing date, incorporating comments \nmade at the tripartite meeting or otherwise communicated. Publication of the findings and \nrecommendations in the final report in DRC\u2019s China Development Review, published in Chinese \nand English, will be considered. All reports will be translated into Chinese. \n   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof the People's Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  in  Grassland  Improvement  Program, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.
