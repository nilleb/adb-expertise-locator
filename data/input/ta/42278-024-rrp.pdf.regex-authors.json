THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Second Strengthening Technical \nand Vocational Education and Training Project.1 \n2.  Building on the lessons of the Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and \nTraining Project,2 the proposed project will continue to support efforts to realign technical and \nvocational education and training (TVET) with current and future labor market needs by (i) \nupgrading teaching and learning environments at eight vocational colleges, (ii) strengthening \nteachers\u2019 competencies to deliver student-centered practical training in skill areas that are in \ndemand, and (iii) improving the management of colleges and fostering an environment that \ndemonstrates the principles of entrepreneurship and promotes involvement of companies and \ncommunities in TVET. The project will increase poor and disadvantaged students\u2019 access to \nTVET through targeted direct stipends and more dormitory spaces at colleges. The project will \nalso undertake TVET promotion measures to improve the public image of TVET and enhance \nunderstanding of TVET products and services among youth, their parents, and communities.3 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Labor market dynamics. The Lao economy grew at an annual average of 7% from \n2005 to 2015. The services sector is the largest gross domestic product (GDP) contributor \n(37.9%), employing 19.7% of the labor force. Industry contributed 32.4% to GDP and employed \nabout 8.0% of the labor force. Although about 70.0% of the population continues to derive its \nincome mainly from agriculture, its GDP share fell from about 45.0% in 2000 to 23.1% in 2014. \nGiven a high percentage of the labor force engaged in small farming, more than three-quarters \nof the labor force is estimated to be involved in informal sector activities. Demographic trends \nsuggest that the labor force will continue to grow until 2025, but the labor market structure will \nchange as more workers shift from agriculture to industry and services. However, business \ncommunities in the industry and services sectors have identified the lack of adequate skills \namong TVET graduates to be a major challenge in finding better-paying jobs.4 To accelerate the \nshift toward the technology-intensive industry and services sectors, a sufficient supply of labor \nwith advanced skills will be essential. This requires aligning TVET services with labor market \ndemands. Currently, only one-third of workers of age 18\u201327 in nonagricultural jobs have any \npostsecondary,  TVET,  or  higher  education.  The  2015  establishment  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community is placing further pressure on the \ngovernment to improve the performance of TVET to advance productivity and competitiveness \nof Lao companies. Although the Lao PDR made considerable progress in modernizing the \nTVET system, it is vital to expand and improve the quality and relevance of TVET to cope with \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Second \nTechnical and Vocational Education Development Project (TA 8964-LAO).  \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic for Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project. Manila. \n(Grant 0211-LAO, $23.0 million, approved on 9 July 2010 and completed in September 2016).  \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  ADB, International Labour Organization, and German development cooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit reports suggest that skilled labor is needed throughout the industry and services \nsectors. Manufacturing companies need engineers and workers with advanced skills to operate and maintain \nmachinery, as well as toolmakers, electricians, general mechanics, and information and communication technology \nstaff. In construction-related occupations, quality skills are in demand, including electricians, welders, plumbers, \ncarpenters, and bricklayers. Companies seek graduates with advanced management and administrative skills. \n ", "2 \nthe increasing demand for a competent workforce.  \n4.  Need for expansion. The TVET system comprises 23 public vocational colleges under \nthe Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) and about 40 private training providers. Private \nTVET institutions are mostly located in urban areas, offering programs related to management, \ninformation and communication technology, and business administration, which do not require \nexpensive training equipment. About 26,300 students (of whom about 10,500 are women) are \nenrolled in public TVET colleges, and about 36,400 are enrolled in private TVET institutions. \nConsidering  (i) demographic  trends,  (ii)  the  growing  demand  for  skilled  labor,  and  (iii)  the \nincreasing number of secondary graduates seeking to acquire technical and managerial skills, \nthe government anticipates that the number of students in public TVET colleges will increase to \nabout  63,000  by  2020.  This  would  require  a  substantial  expansion  of  the  existing  TVET \ncapacity. MOES employs about 2,300 TVET teachers. To deal with the increased number of \nstudents, MOES expects that more than 1,000 new teachers will be required, and MOES also \nanticipates that the current facilities at the 23 public colleges will have to be expanded and \nupgraded. At present, there are about 1,200 classrooms and workshops at public colleges. By \n2020, about 2,000 classrooms and workshops will be needed to accommodate students. \n5.  TVET financing. About 15.5% of annual national public expenditure has been directed \nto education from 2008\u20132015. This share is expected to increase to 17.0% by 2020. The share \nof  funding  provided  for  TVET  within  MOES  overall  budget  is  relatively  small.  However, \naccording to MOES\u2019 projection, the share of expenditures for TVET will increase from 2.7% in \n2015  to  4.0%  in  2019,  although  no  reliable  estimates  can  indicate  whether  the  projected \nincrease will be adequate to cover the additional costs for expanding facilities, financing a larger \nteaching force, and covering operation and maintenance costs for workshops, dormitories, and \nequipment. Initial estimates of the required capital investments to modernize and expand TVET \ninfrastructure are $50.0 million for 2017\u20132020. However, this estimate does not consider the \nspecific and costly equipment that will be needed both to introduce new programs and upgrade \nexisting training programs in technology-driven occupations. \n6.  Quality  and  relevance  of  TVET.  Key  issues  in  TVET  include  the  low  level  of \ninvolvement of companies in TVET programs and in assessment schemes, and a lack of \nopportunities for students to gain hands-on experience at college workshops or at company \nsites.  Another  challenge  is  the  limited  competence  of  teachers  to  adopt  modern  teaching \ntechniques  that  integrate  practical  skills  training  with  theoretical  content.  Outdated  and \ninadequate equipment and workshops hamper teaching and learning at many TVET institutions. \nGiven  limited  formal  employment  opportunities,  many  TVET  graduates  seek  jobs  or  self-\nemployment in the informal sector. To help graduates to start their own businesses, programs \nneed  to  consider  entrepreneurial  approaches  to  improve  the  ability  of  students  to  identify \nbusiness opportunities and respond to local market demand. \n7.  Access to TVET. Access to TVET is constrained by negative public perceptions of \nTVET coupled with a general preference for white collar jobs. This reflects both the perceived \nlow  quality  of  TVET  colleges  and  a  lack  of  understanding  of  TVET  services  and  job \nopportunities  for  TVET  graduates.  Students  and  parents  have  limited  information  on  the \nchanging job market, the careers that will be in demand, salary scales for skilled employment, \nand the role of TVET in preparing students for emerging opportunities. Where there is demand \nfor TVET courses, economic constraints often hamper access given high poverty rates. About \ntwo-thirds of the population lives on less than $2 per day, and many families cannot afford the \ndirect  costs  or  the  opportunity  costs  associated  with  sending  their  children  to  a  full-time \nresidential TVET course.  \n ", "3 \n8.  Government strategy. The Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016\u2013\n2020 sets out strategies to promote (i) regional and international integration within the ASEAN \nEconomic Community, and (ii) industrialization and modernization of the Lao PDR economy \ntoward  becoming  an  upper-middle-income  country. The  plan recognizes  the  importance of \nhuman resource development in achieving the country's social and economic objectives and \nprioritizes improvement of education services. Upgrading TVET is part of the human resource \ndevelopment strategy and the national education sector reforms. MOES endorsed the TVET \nDevelopment Plan 2016\u20132020, which aims to increase access to TVET and strengthen the \ndelivery of TVET programs. The project will contribute to achieving the targets to (i) expand the \nTVET system and (ii) improve the relevance and quality of programs delivered by colleges. \n9.  Development coordination. The Government of Germany supports 12 colleges and \nprovides (i) policy advice to strengthen the overall TVET system, (ii) technical assistance for the \ndevelopment  of  a  National  Qualification  Framework,5 standards,  curriculum  modules,  and \ndesign of training programs, (iii) limited funding for scholarships, (iv) infrastructure support to \nupgrade teaching and learning environments, and (v) assistance to the Vocational Education \nDevelopment  Institute  in  developing  and  implementing  strategies  to  advance  professional \ndevelopment of teachers. The governments of Switzerland and Luxembourg provide assistance \nto strengthen TVET for tourism and hospitality and stipends to poor students. The modality of \nthe project\u2019s stipend scheme will be harmonized with stipend programs of other development \npartners. \n10.  Lessons  and  ADB  support.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  the  leading \ndevelopment partner in post-basic education in the Lao PDR. ADB has supported the senior \nsecondary,  TVET,  and  higher  education6 subsectors  since  2006  and  was  instrumental  in \npreparing the national human resource development strategy. The 2010 country assistance \nprogram evaluation rated ADB\u2019s education sector assistance as  successful.7 Lessons from \nADB\u2019s  Strengthening Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and Training  Project  include the \nfollowing: (i) employers need to be involved in planning at the college level to ensure that \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  and  equipment  are  relevant  and  demand-driven,  (ii)  strong \ncommitment of college leadership is essential to ensure that project investments are sustained \nand modern teaching approaches are adopted, (iii) the complex design of a training assistance \nvoucher program for poor students was too ambitious in its attempt to create competition among \ninstitutions  to  improve  quality  while  also  channeling  resources  to  students,  (iv)  innovative \napproaches to professional development for teachers and managers are required to introduce \nan  entrepreneurial  culture  in  managing  colleges  and  program  delivery,  and  (v)  sufficient \nresources need to be allocated to operate and maintain facilities. Based on these lessons, the \nproject  was  designed  with  a  strong  demand-driven  approach  and  with  the  intention  to \ncomplement the efforts of other development partners with a major focus on expanding the \ncapacity of and access to TVET and strengthening TVET delivery at the institutional level.8 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact, which is aligned with the Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan \nand the TVET Development Plan for 2016\u20132020, will be sufficient skilled  labor available to \n                                                \n5  A comprehensive National Qualification Framework is not yet in place. \n6  ADB.

Outputs \n12.  The project has three outputs: (i) teaching and learning environments at eight TVET \ncolleges  upgraded,  (ii)  quality  and  relevance  of  demand-driven  programs  improved,  and \n(iii) access to TVET institutions for disadvantaged students increased. Based on the lessons from \nthe previous project, the project will adopt a demand-driven approach to upgrading eight TVET \ncolleges that do not receive substantial support from other development partners. To ensure \nownership and meet the demands of the local companies and communities, colleges prepare \ndevelopment plans jointly with representatives from firms and communities. The plans identify \nthe key areas of support based on the needs and describe challenges and opportunities of the \nindividual college and include information on student enrollment, teaching force, current training \nprograms,  quality  and  quantity  of  facilities,  budgets,  collaboration  with  communities  and \ncompanies, and brief assessments of the local labor market.9 \n13.  Output 1: Teaching and learning environments at eight TVET colleges upgraded. \nTo address urgent infrastructure needs, up to $4.6 million from grant proceeds may be allocated \nfor civil works at (i) Pakpasak Technical College in Vientiane, (ii) Savannakhet Technical and \nVocational  College,  (iii)  Vientiane\u2013Hanoi  Friendship Technical  and  Vocational  College,  and \n(iv) the agriculture campus at the Khammouane Technical and Vocational College. These four \ncolleges will prepare detailed proposals for civil works to upgrade their facilities, which may \ninclude  (i)  constructing  or  renovating  existing  workshops,  (ii)  constructing  and  expanding \ndormitories, (iii) improving water and sanitation facilities, (iv) constructing or rehabilitating school \nkitchens and canteens, and (v) improving the overall environment of college campuses toward \ncreating a green and student-friendly atmosphere. The proposals will indicate the availability of \nadequate funding and competent capacity to effectively manage upgraded facilities. They will \ninclude a maintenance plan indicating responsibilities and resources for maintenance tasks. \nProposals will also provide a sound rationale for the planned utilization of new and upgraded \nfacilities based on future enrollment projections and training programs that are in demand by \nlocal companies and communities. Colleges are developing proposals, and MOES and ADB will \nendorse them after project effectiveness. In addition, the Polytechnic College of Vientiane may \naccess up to $400,000 to rehabilitate and build workshops. \n14.  Up to $6.0 million is allocated to purchasing training equipment. During the project \npreparatory phase, all eight project colleges began preparing proposals for equipment to be \nreviewed and endorsed by MOES and ADB. Proposals have to be based on current and future \ntraining  programs  that  reflect  labor  market  needs  and  enrollment  forecasts.  College \nmanagement must demonstrate that (i) proposed equipment requests are in line with ongoing \nand new training programs that are supported by local employers; (ii) new equipment will be \nintegrated in training programs to support student-centered teaching approaches and increase \nhands-on training opportunities; (iii) sufficient budget is available for consumables to sustain \ntraining programs; and (iv) teachers are able to operate new training equipment, or will be \ntrained.  Consultants  will  help  project  colleges  finalize  proposals  and  prepare  the  detailed \n                                                \n9  The following colleges will be supported under the project: (i) Polytechnic College Vientiane, (ii) Savannakhet \nTechnical and  Vocational  College,  (iii)  Pakpasak  Technical  College  (Vientiane  Capital),  (iv)  Dongkhamxang \nAgriculture Technical School (Vientiane), (v) Technical College of Vientiane Province, (vi) Champasak Technical \nand  Vocational  College  (Champasak  Province),  (vii)  Khammouane  Technical  and  Vocational  College,  and \n(viii) Vientiane\u2013Hanoi Friendship Technical and Vocational College. Skills areas identified by the colleges and local \nindustry  include  (i)  automotive,  (ii)  basic  electrical-electronics,  (iii)  road  and  bridge  construction,  (iv)  food \nprocessing and agriculture, and (v) IT related skills.  \n ", "5 \nequipment technical specifications to be used for tendering. The final amount for civil works and \nequipment for each college will vary and depend on the actual situation and needs, which will be \ndetermined jointly by college management, MOES, and ADB based on the proposals. \n15.  Output 2: Quality and relevance of demand-driven programs improved. Output 2 \nwill provide resources for all eight project colleges to (i) improve technical and pedagogy skills \nand  knowledge  of  teachers  toward  promoting  student-centered  teaching  approaches  and \nincreased  hands-on  training  for  students,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  management  capacity  of \ncurrent  and future college  leaders  and administrators  toward  promoting  an  entrepreneurial \napproach in managing colleges. The project will engage individual consultants and a firm to \nfacilitate capacity-strengthening measures with the intent to establish continuous training and \ncoaching opportunities at the colleges based on the needs of teachers and managers. Support \nfor teachers, managers, and administrators could include (i) short technical and managerial \ntraining programs, (ii) coaching by senior teachers or industry trainers, (iii) improved inspection \nand guidance at the colleges, (iv) establishing teacher self-help groups, and (v) apprenticeship \nschemes at companies. Teachers will also receive training to ensure that equipment purchased \nunder  the  project  is  used  effectively,  integrated  in  the  teaching  process,  and  suitably \nmaintained. Training strategies for teachers will be coordinated with the Vocational Education \nDevelopment Institute and development partners. The project will also provide $1.6 million to \nupgrade the academic qualification of TVET teachers from public colleges to gain bachelor or \nmaster\u2019s degrees in their field of specialization.10 \n16.  Based on the first ADB-financed TVET project\u2019s success in promoting short-term skills \ntraining courses, the project will assist colleges to develop and roll out more of these for out-of-\nschool youth and adults. It will promote entrepreneurial approaches to help young people and \nadults  in  the  informal  sector  upgrade  their  skills  to  find  better-paying  jobs  or  start  self-\nemployment.  Colleges  will  prepare  course  content  and  delivery  methods  based  on  local \ndemand.  Considering  the  high  share  of  women  in  the  informal  sector,  short  courses  will \nparticularly focus on local needs that will benefit women. The project will (i) introduce new \ntraining programs responding to industry and community demand, and (ii) develop competency-\nbased standards, curriculum modules, and training materials. To help graduates at the project \ncolleges find employment or become self-employed, the project will establish career guidance \nservices for students enrolled at TVET colleges. Career guidance units will establish links with \nthe local business community, provide advice on job opportunities and salary expectations, \nfacilitate internships, and provide entrepreneurship guidance for self-employment. \n17.  Output  3:  Access  to  TVET  institutions  for  disadvantaged  students  increased. \nOutput  3  will  increase  disadvantaged  students\u2019  access  to  TVET  through  (i)  a  $4.0 million \nprogram of targeted direct stipends, and (ii) the development and refinement of TVET promotion \nstrategies to increase demand. The stipend program replaces and streamlines the previous \nvoucher system. The stipend amount set in consultation with MOES is better harmonized with \nother development partners\u2019 stipend programs. The principle is to make regular transfers that \ncover all costs of attending TVET to minimize the risk of dropping out for financial reasons. To \nbe eligible for the stipend, a student must (i) be poor or disadvantaged, (ii) enroll at one of the \neight project colleges, and (iii) be at least 16 years old. MOES will select the recipients using a \ntransparent process, and at least half of them will be women. Adopting an innovation from other \n                                                \n10 The Technical and Vocational Education Department (TVED) will select teachers. To receive support, teachers \nshould be under 45 years old, supported by their college director, and must have worked at a vocational college for \nat least 5 years. Selected teachers will sign a binding agreement committing to return to their TVET college after \ngraduation for at least 5 years; otherwise, they have to return the entire scholarship amount. TVED will prepare a \ncontract template for ADB review and endorsement prior to the commencement of the scheme. \n ", "6 \nexisting  stipend  programs  in  Lao  PDR,  payment  will  be  made  directly  to  students\u2019  bank \naccounts on a monthly basis and will be accessible via ATM cards. The total number of students \nsupported will depend on the duration of the courses they select, but may be as high as 4,600.11 \n18.  Output 3 will also refine and implement TVET promotion strategies to improve the public \nimage of TVET and promote enhanced understanding of TVET products and services among \nyouth, including school graduates, their parents, communities, and potential employers. The \ngoal is to increase TVET enrollment. Strategies will include (i) testing and adopting a range of \ncommunication for development tools with the aim of developing a common brand for TVET and \nproviding better information to a diverse range of stakeholders on the potential jobs that skilled \nworkers are able to access; (ii) promotion of the stipend program among eligible disadvantaged \nstudents; and (iii) building on social marketing plans and products created previously by MOES, \nwhich will be expanded through (a) national media and branding activities to promote positive \nperceptions and build awareness, trust, and credibility of TVET; and (b) the rollout of social \nmarketing activities in the communities in the geographic area of each project college. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $26.5 million (Table 1). The government requested a \ngrant not exceeding $25.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the \nproject; this is equal to 94.3% of the project cost. The government will contribute $1.5 million or \n5.7% of the project cost (Table 2). \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem     Amount \nA.  Base Cost   \n  1.

Implementation Arrangements \n20.  Based on the implementation arrangements established under the first TVET project, \nwhich proved to be efficient, the project will have a similar management structure. MOES will be \nthe executing agency; the implementing agency will be the Technical and Vocational Education \nDepartment (TVED). The first project\u2019s management unit will continue to facilitate and supervise \nday-to-day  implementation  of  project  activities.  Each  college  will  establish  a  project \nimplementation unit headed by the college principal. A project steering committee will provide \noverall project guidance and support cross-agency policy dialogue. The MOES vice-minister for \nTVET  will  chair  the  committee,  with  the  TVED  director  general  as  committee  secretary. \nCommittee members will be representatives from MOES, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, and from business communities. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.12 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements     \nImplementation period  January 2017\u2212December 2020   \nEstimated completion date    31 December 2020; closing date is 30 June 2021 \nManagement       \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee chaired by vice-minister, MOES \n    Members: MOES, MOF, MPI, representatives from business communities \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOES     \n(iii)   Key implementing agency  TVED     \n(iv)  Project management unit  TVED, 8\u201310 staff   \nProcurement  ICB  5 contracts  $5,300,000 \n    NCB  6 contracts  $4,850,000 \n    Shopping  3 contracts  $290,000 \nConsulting services   Two firms (QCBS)  $1,700,000 \n   362 person-months national consultants  $905,000 \n   20  person-months international consultants  $270,000 \nProject implementation unit staff   24 person-months international consultants  $360,000 \n   172 person-months national consultants  $478,000 \n   144 person-months support staff  $87,000 \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \n    Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \n    arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, MOES = Ministry of Education and Sports, \nMOF = Ministry of Finance, MPI = Ministry of Planning and Investment, NCB = national competitive bidding, QCBS = \nquality- and cost-based selection, TVED = Technical and Vocational Education Department.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The direct beneficiaries will be the 40,000 students enrolled in the project colleges over \n4 years of project implementation. They will benefit from improvements of the overall teaching \nand learning environments. Demand-driven training programs, upgraded training facilities, and \npractice-oriented training approaches will contribute to improve their skills and enhance their \nemployment and income-earning opportunities after graduation. It is assumed that at least 1,500 \nadults and out-of-school youths will benefit from short-term skills training courses, which will \nhelp them find better-paying jobs or start their own formal sector businesses. Since more than \n                                                \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n75% of youths and adults participating in training programs belong to low-income families, the \nproject will contribute to reducing poverty. Companies will benefit from improvements in the \nrelevance and quality of training that will result in better-skilled workers, which will contribute to \nincreased productivity. Access to TVET for poor students will be enhanced by the stipend \nscheme  and  the  expansion  of  dormitory  capacity.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is \nestimated at 17.87%.13 \n22.  The project should be financially sustainable as the bulk of expenditures is expected not \nto  carry  on  beyond  the  end  of  the  project.  Recurrent  expenditures  such  as  facility  and \nequipment  maintenance  cost  will  be  absorbed  by  government  funding.  Colleges  will  earn \nadditional  income  through  student  fees  and  tailored  training  for  enterprises.  The  TVET \nDevelopment Plan 2016\u20132020 indicates that the budget for TVET is expected to rise, which will \nprovide additional funding to cover recurrent expenditures. Efficiency gains in the eight project \ncolleges will be realized in part through increased enrollment and the resulting higher utilization \nof facilities and equipment, and by adopting an entrepreneurial approach in managing colleges \nmore efficiently. The government\u2019s commitment to the project as a percentage of the 2016 \nTVET budget is 0.3% per year and is expected to decline because of the increase of the overall \nTVET budget. The government\u2019s annual commitment is, therefore, deemed affordable. \n23.  Incremental operating costs will be associated with the new dormitory, workshops, and \ntraining equipment financed under the project. The total investment in facility upgrading is \n$11 million.  Assuming  that  operating  costs,  repairs,  and  maintenance  equal  4.0%  of  the \ninvestment, the incremental recurrent cost will be $440,000 annually beginning in FY2019, \nwhich amounts to less than 1.5% of the TVET budget. In succeeding years, this proportion is \nlikely to fall as the government TVET budget rises. This, plus the fact that upgraded facilities will \nenable TVET institutions to offer services and start small production of goods to earn additional \nincome, suggests that the project's incremental operating costs are sustainable.  \nB.  Governance \n24.  Assessment of financial management and procurement capacity found that TVED has \nsufficient capacity to carry out the project. TVED effectively implemented the previous ADB-\nfinanced TVET project and other projects financed by development partners. The financial \nmanagement assessment found sufficient capacity and staffing in the accounting and finance \nsection of MOES to support TVED. The project management unit established under the first \nTVET project will continue to manage the project activities, including preparing financial reports \nto be submitted to ADB, the Ministry of Finance, and MOES. Consultants will support the unit to \ncarry out procurement and disbursement activities in a timely and effective manner and provide \ntraining on financial planning, accounting, and establishing and maintaining a performance-\nbased planning and budgeting system. The unit will be supported by the Financial Department \nof  MOES.  Accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and \nauditing arrangements were assessed by the State Audit Office, which confirmed that the \nfinancial management capacity to operate the project was appropriate. The project will support \nthe TVED to supplement procurement capacity, including training in the preparation of bid \ndocuments for civil works and bid evaluations, and site management and monitoring of civil \n                                                \n13  The Economic Internal Return of Rate (EIRR) is calculated based on the projected rise in TVET students as a \nresult of the expansion of the selected TVET colleges, the improved employability of graduates as a result of \nquality improvements of the teaching and learning process, and the increased income of TVET graduates. Cost \nfactors include investment costs, recurrent costs and opportunity costs. Cost-benefit analysis over 25 years yielded \nan EIRR of 17.87%, which is higher than the EIRR of the first TVET project (15.2%). The detailed Financial and \nEconomic Analysis is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n ", "9 \nworks implementation. The project will establish a website that will disclose information related \nto disbursement, procurement, and project progress. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \nC.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Based on the national poverty line, the poverty incidence in the Lao PDR fell from 27.6% \nin 2008 to 23.4% in 2013. The rate of poverty reduction has been slow relative to the high rate \nof GDP growth, which has not translated into commensurately high growth in consumption. \nInequality has increased, two-thirds of the population continues to live on less than $2 per day, \nand  many  households  remain  vulnerable  to  falling  into  poverty.  The  national  average \nimprovements  in  welfare  mask  significant  differences  between  regions  and  socioeconomic \ngroups. In 2013, the poverty incidence was highest among those households whose head had \nno  formal  education  (42.0%)  or  only  some  primary  (36.0%),  and  lowest  among  those \nhouseholds whose head had a university degree (4.0%) or had completed vocational training \n(6.0%). This shows the direct link between TVET and improved welfare. The stipend scheme \nwill benefit up to 4,600 students, of whom at least half will be young women. By promoting \nequitable access to improved quality TVET, including through stipends targeted to the poor and \nvulnerable, the project will directly contribute to poverty reduction. Equipped with better skills, \nyoung people will have access to better jobs, earn higher incomes, and be the drivers of \ninclusive growth.  \n26.  The project includes a gender action plan to promote women\u2019s increased participation in \nproject benefits. Fewer women are enrolled in secondary and tertiary education than men, \nhighlighting that women still face challenges in completing a full cycle of education to the tertiary \nlevel. The gender gap in favor of men is more pronounced among the poor, with disparities \nhighest in the north and in rural, remote, and ethnic areas, as well as among those whose \nmothers have no education. Key project targets include: (i) by 2020, 90% of both female and \nmale TVET college graduates find employment or start their own business in the area they have \nbeen  trained  in  within  6  months  of graduation;  (ii)  50%  of  the  new  dormitory  spaces  are \nreserved for female students; (iii) dormitories have separate spaces and facilities for women and \nmen; (iv) all female managers and teachers at the project colleges will participate in pedagogy, \ntechnical, and management training; (v) 35% of teachers of the academic upgrading program \nare  women;  (vi)  skills  standards  manuals,  new  TVET  curriculum,  and  training  programs \ndeveloped  under  the  project  are  gender-sensitive  and  provide  positive  images  of  women; \n(vii) 50% of students in apprenticeship schemes in companies are women; (viii) 50% of students \nin short-term training courses for out-of-school youth are women; (ix) 30% of career counsellors \nare women; and (x) 50% of stipend assistance is provided to women. \nD.  Safeguards \n27.  The  involuntary  resettlement  category  is  C,  as  civil  works  are  limited  to  upgrading \nexisting  facilities  and  constructing  new  buildings  within  the  boundaries  of  the  respective \ncolleges,  which  will  not  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  The  indigenous  peoples' \ncategorization is C. The project is not expected to have any negative impacts on indigenous \npeoples, and will not discriminate against them or other marginalized groups. The environmental \ncategorization is B. An initial environmental examination was carried out and an environment \nmanagement plan was developed.14 The operation of workshops will ensure proper disposal of \nwaste. During construction, the contractor will keep noise and dust within locally acceptable \n                                                \n14 Initial Environment Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nlevels, as well as manage fill, excavated material, and solid waste in a manner that does not \ncreate a permanent impact.   \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 The major risks are that the government \nfails to keep its commitment to increase funding for TVET, the supply of appropriately trained \nteachers is not adequate to improve TVET quality, and the poor social perception of TVET \nmeans that employers and potential students are not interested in TVET. These risks are \naddressed under the project. The benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the risks. \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFailure to provide sufficient  The government has endorsed the TVET Master Plan 2016\u20132020, and is \nfunding to expand TVET  committed to gradually increasing the allocation to TVET to expand the system. \nservices and sustain quality of  The project will contribute to the investment plan by financing the expansion of \nTVET provision  TVET facilities at eight colleges. \nInadequate supply of trained  The government is in the process of strengthening the pre-service training of \nteachers will frustrate the ability  new teachers.
