THE ENSUING PROJECT  \n \n1.  The proposed Northern  Cross-Border Power Trade and Distribution Project aims to \npromote regional power exchange in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and expand access \nto energy in several northern provinces in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The \nproject will help address Lao PDR\u2019s need to: (i) expand access to low-cost, reliable power in rural \nareas; and (ii) develop power interconnections between Lao PDR and Thailand and Myanmar to \nincrease power trade. The project will support the national electric utility, Electricite du Laos (EDL), \nwith the following outputs: (i) electricity distribution expanded in the provinces of Luang Namtha, \nBokeo, and Phongsaly, including provision of at least 8,000 household electricity meters; and (ii) \ncross-border transmission line(s) connecting Lao PDR with Thailand and/or Myanmar constructed. \nThe outcome will be domestic electricity consumption and cross-border electricity trade increased. \nThe impact will be Lao PDR graduated from least developed country status, as stated in the Vision \n2030 and National Ten-Year Socio-Economic Development Strategy, 2016\u20132025.1 The indicative \namounts of the proposed project are (i) $24.4 million in concessional ordinary capital resources \nlending funds, (ii) $3.0 million in grant resources from the Asian Development Fund,2 and (iii) \n$10.0 million from the Government of Lao PDR. The project and this transaction technical \nassistance (TRTA) are included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for Lao PDR. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n2.  In recent  years,  Lao  PDR  has  seen tremendous growth  in  economic  development, \naveraging 7.6% from 2010\u20132016. Poverty has been reduced from 46% in 1992/93 to 23% in 2013. \nThe energy sector has been a major contributor to the country\u2019s development. As the \u201cbattery of \nSoutheast Asia,\u201d Lao PDR\u2019s hydropower development and electricity exports have been a critical \nsource of revenue for the country. In 2016, electricity accounted for 21% of the country\u2019s exports.3 \nAt the same time, the government\u2019s effort to expand access to electricity within its borders has \nled to the early achievement of its target of 90% electrification by 2020. Currently, 92% of \nhouseholds have access to electricity through an on-grid connection, off-grid system or solar \nhome system (SHS).4 The government has since reset its objective to 95% electrification by 2020. \n \n3.  Despite the government\u2019s achievements, challenges remain in the energy sector. EDL\u2019s \nfragmented transmission and distribution system does not yet cover the entire country. As a result, \nthere is great disparity in electrification rates between urban and rural areas. For example, \nregional data from 2015 shows that northern provinces of Bokeo, Luang Namtha, and Phongsaly \nhad a combined electrification rate of 73% of households, with Phongsaly province alone at 46%, \nwhile Vientiane had reached over 99%.5 Poverty remains high in these provinces, with an \nestimated 24% of households classified as poor in 2013, compared with 5.9% in Vientiane.6 \nUnconnected rural households must choose between expensive off-grid electricity (primarily \ndiesel) or none at all. However, the government realizes that expanding access to the few \n                                                \n1  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2016.

The lack of a unified national electricity grid also contributes to increased system losses \nand affects reliability of supply. The current grid capacity is insufficient to meet peak demand in \nurban centers or keep up with growing demand. In addition, Lao PDR\u2019s reliance on hydropower \nleads to seasonal imbalances: during the wet season, hydropower is abundant and EDL has \nexcess capacity; during the dry season, EDL experiences shortages of supply and must import \npower. Regional power trade can solve these imbalances and support expanded access in \nneighboring countries, benefiting the GMS as a whole. \n \n5.  The government\u2019s objectives are to further reduce poverty and alleviate fiscal sensitivities. \nIn its Vision 2030 and National Ten-Year Socio-Economic Development Strategy, 2016\u20132025 \n(footnote 1), operationalized in the Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2016\u2013\n20207, the government targets Lao PDR\u2019s graduation from least-developed country status by \n2025  through  sustainable  and  inclusive  development.  Thus,  improving  electrification  to \nhouseholds  in  rural  areas  and  adding  to  the  hydropower  export  capacity  are  two  critical \ngovernmental objectives. \n \n6.  ADB  has  provided  extensive  support  to  the  development  of  Lao  PDR\u2019s  electricity \ninfrastructure since 1992 through several projects focused on generation and transmission and \ndistribution. ADB\u2019s ongoing GMS Northern Power Transmission Project,8 nearing completion, is \nextending 115-kilovolt transmission lines and distribution systems in Xaiyabuli, Phongsaly, and \nVientiane provinces, and supporting an interconnection with the Electricity Generating Authority \nof Thailand\u2013Provincial Electricity Authority system.  \n \n7.  Building on this experience, the proposed Northern Cross-Border Power Trade and \nDistribution Project will support EDL with the following outputs: (i) electricity distribution expanded \nin the provinces of Luang Namtha, Bokeo, and Phongsaly, including provision of at least 8,000 \nhousehold electricity meters to reach approximately 31% of the unserved households in the three \nprovinces; and (ii) cross-border transmission line(s) connecting Lao PDR with Thailand and/or \nMyanmar constructed. Support for the project was requested by the government of Lao PDR in \n2016. A scoping mission carried out in February\u2013March 2017 reviewed the government\u2019s request \nand reached an understanding with the government, EDL and the Ministry of Energy and Mines \non the scope of the proposed TRTA to prepare the project.  \n \n8.  The proposed TRTA will help the government to identify all project components and \nprepare the project through completion of the project feasibility study, least-cost electrification \nanalysis, front-end engineering design, and preparation of bid documents for the engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  contract  for  the  transmission  and  distribution  systems \nrecommended.9  \n \n                                                \n7  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2016.

Project due diligence will (i) evaluate the feasibility of one or more high-voltage cross-\nborder connections between Lao PDR and Thailand and/or Myanmar, consisting of the following \noptions: \n \n(a)  from Ban Tonpheng (Bokeo Province, Lao PDR) to Mea Chan (Thailand),  \n(b)  from Ban Tonpheng (Bokeo Province, Lao PDR) to Shan State (Myanmar), and  \n(c)  from Meung Long (Luang Namtha, Lao PDR) to Shan State (Myanmar);  \n \n(ii) conduct a system study of cross-border interconnector options of 115/230/500 kilovolt as may \nbe determined and evaluate the feasibility of using high-temperature low-sag conductors; (iii) \ndetermine the optimal combination of on-grid and/or off-grid solutions for rural electrification in \nthree  northern  provinces  (Luang  Namtha,  Bokeo,  and  Phongsaly)  through  a  least-cost \nelectrification  planning  approach;  and  (iv)  develop  an  investment  plan  for  the  various \nelectrification options.  \n \n10.  To optimize the financial and economic benefits of rural electrification requires a \u201cleast-\ncost\u201d analysis approach in which all options are considered and the optimized solution provided \nto the subject remote community and households. Least-cost analysis includes (i) streamlining \npolicy, management and implementation mechanisms; (ii) review of existing on-grid distribution \npractices to minimize distribution line costs; and (iii) review of off-grid solutions optimizing least-\ncost generation, power line distribution, and connections as required. Options to be reviewed \ninclude extension of the grid through 3-phase and 1-phase systems including single wire earth \nreturn, off-grid mini (>25 kilowatts) and micro (2 kilowatts\u201325 kilowatts) systems, and SHS (50\u2013\n100  watts).  According  to  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines  data,  most  villages  requiring \nelectrification by 2020 average less than 60 households and thus fall into the mini-grid range. \nVillages and households can be identified and aggregated through geographic information system \ntechniques and software tools such as Homer can determine optimal off-grid generation options. \nNetwork Planner software uses the geographic information system data, load data, and optimized \ngeneration source data to determine the least-cost supply: be that on-grid or off-grid. This analysis \nis a financial approach to least-cost and must include asset life-cycle. Load flow studies using \nDIgSILENT will be used to optimize grid connected distribution. \n \n11.  A least-cost electrification plan supports effective communication with sources of funds \nenabling alignment of electrification projects to available funding, including public funding from \nthe government via subsidies, EDL, international funding agencies, private investment, or public-\nprivate partnerships. For the project, government contributions through the Power to the Poor \nprogram of subsidies to low-income households and other potential sources of funding, such as \nADB\u2019s output based aid grants, will be assessed during project preparation.  \n \nB.
