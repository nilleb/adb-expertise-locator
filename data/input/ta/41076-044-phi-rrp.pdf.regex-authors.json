THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational  Development  (OFID),1  both  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Road \nImprovement and Institutional Development Project.2  \n \n2.  The project will result in improved accessibility of transport infrastructure and services. \nThe outcome of the project will be more effective management by the Department of Public \nWorks and Highways (DPWH) of the road network in the project areas. The project outputs \ninclude (i) periodic maintenance of nine national roads in the west coast of Luzon, the Visayas, \nand Mindanao; (ii) detailed engineering design of roads to be maintained or improved under the \nproject and future projects; and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity in the road subsector.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Strategic context. An efficient road subsector is crucial for the Philippines\u2019 economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) analysis of roads in the \nPhilippines and other countries found that roads are critical as social arteries for the delivery of \ngovernment services, penetration of ideas and cultures, and dissemination of technology to the \npeople.4 \n \n4.  The Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 envisions \u201ca safe, secure, efficient, viable, \ncompetitive,  dependable,  integrated,  environmentally  sustainable,  and  people-oriented \nPhilippine transportation system.\u201d5 It specifies six activities necessary to achieve this overall \nobjective: (i) adopt a comprehensive long-term national transport policy; (ii) develop strategic \ntransport infrastructure, and maintain and manage transport infrastructure assets; (iii) develop \nan  integrated  multimodal  logistics  and  transport  system;  (iv)  separate  the  regulatory  and \noperation functions of transport and other concerned agencies; (v) comply with safety and \nsecurity standards; and (vi) provide links to bring communities into the mainstream of progress \nand development. The project will contribute to achieving the plan\u2019s objective by helping to \nmaintain and manage transport infrastructure assets, and to strengthen the institutional capacity \nof DPWH, one of the primary agencies in the transport sector. \n \n5.  The project supports the key objective of ADB\u2019s strategy for the Philippines of helping \nthe country achieve high, inclusive, and sustainable growth.6 The project has been included in \nthe ADB lending program to assist in improving the investment climate and expanding private \nsector development through the scaling up of infrastructure investments and supporting policy \nreforms.7 The project is also fully consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 through its focus on \nimproving the delivery of infrastructure services as well as investing in physical assets.8 The \n                                                 \n1  OPEC = Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2008.

Road subsector. The Philippines road network carries about 58% of all domestic freight \ntraffic and 98% of domestic passenger traffic. The national road network comprises 29,630 \nkilometers (km), or 14% of the total road network in the country, of which 73% is paved. The \nnational road network includes the main trunk roads running the length and breadth of the \ncountry,  the  main  arterial  roads  (which  provide  direct  access  to  important  population  and \nproduction centers), and national secondary roads (which provide access to other population \nand production centers).  \n \n7.  Despite its importance to the national economy, the road subsector has not received \nadequate funding. During 1999\u20132008, investment in the transport sector averaged less than 1% \nof gross domestic product compared with 4% for other Asian countries. While roads received a \nsubstantial share of the available investment funds, expansion or improvement of the network \nhas  been  limited  in  recent  years.  In  addition,  many  roads  deteriorate  prematurely  due  to \ninadequate maintenance. Around 23% of the national road network is in poor condition and in \nneed of rehabilitation. \n \n8.  Road maintenance. Inadequate financing for the road subsector in general is clearly \nevident  in  the  lack  of  maintenance  of  existing  road  assets.  The  annual  requirement  for \nmaintaining national roads is estimated at about P16 billion. However, annual expenditures \nthrough 2009 are estimated at about P5 billion, about 30% of the required amount. Financing for \nthe maintenance of national roads is provided from the general budget. Budget allocations for \nroad maintenance have increased significantly since 2008, and such allocations are expected to \nrise  in  the  future.  The  Philippines  does  have  a  special  road  fund  for  maintenance  and \ndesignated revenues are deposited in the fund, however, in recent budgets only about half of \nthe  deposited  revenues  have  been  appropriated  for  national  roads.  The  World  Bank  is \naddressing the issue of insufficient financing for road maintenance by (i) strengthening the \noperation of the road board and utilization of the motor vehicle user charge special funds; (ii) \nreviewing and updating the mandate and implementing rules and regulations of the road board \nand special road fund; and (iii) supporting efforts to recover road user costs in order to expand \nthe revenue base to a sustainable level.  \n \n9.  Institutional capacity. Weak institutional capacity of government sector agencies has \nlong affected the transport sector. Institutional capacity constraints within DPWH, the main \ngovernment agency responsible for road management, have hampered development of the \nroad subsector. ADB\u2019s 2003 country assistance program evaluation for the Philippines found \nthat aside from the weakness of DPWH in maintaining the national road network, it has also not \naddressed its own institutional weaknesses.9 In particular, DPWH is aware of the increasing gap \nbetween the technical capacity of its central office in Manila and the regional and district offices \nof DPWH. This situation has compounded the problem of inadequate funding, as capacity \nlimitations have resulted in available budgets not being fully disbursed or not being used most \neffectively. \n \n10.  Efforts are being undertaken to strengthen DPWH\u2019s institutional capacity. Many of these \nefforts are being supported by external development partners.10 The inadequate institutional \ncapacity, low efficiency in road administration, and weak governance are being addressed \nthrough a number of initiatives financed by the World Bank, Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment, and Japan International Cooperation Agency. The World Bank's National Roads \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2003. Country Assistance Program Evaluation in the Philippines. Manila. \n10  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "3 \n \nImprovement and Management Program Phase 2, approved in 2008 with a cofinancing grant \nfrom Australian Agency for International Development, is providing assistance for (i) supporting \noperations of the road board, including improving road cost recovery; (ii) improving DPWH's \nbusiness processes, including expansion of communications networks and computerization and \nstrengthening internal controls and internal audits; (iii) strengthening partnerships with NGOs \nand  other  road  subsector  stakeholders;  and  (iv)  supporting  pilot  trials  of  commercializing \noperations of district offices, including road maintenance. These activities build on the progress \nmade in these reform areas under the completed World Bank National Roads Improvement and \nManagement Program Phase 1. Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s Road Upgrading and \nPreservation Project, approved in April 2011, is focusing on (i) controlling vehicle overloading, \n(ii) the enhancement of the quality assurance system for maintenance and construction projects, \n(iii) improving disaster recovery capacity, and (iv) expansion of communications networks and \ncomputerization  of  district  offices.  Although  there  is  progress  in  addressing  institutional \nweaknesses and lack of capacity, more substantial efforts to implement new methods and \ntechnologies are necessary to ensure that DPWH's capacity is sufficient to plan, construct, \nmaintain, and manage the national road network. \n \n11.  Governance. As with many other sectors of the economy, governance issues have \nadversely affected transport development, with DPWH identified as one of the main agencies \nwhere  corruption  is  perceived  to  be  prevalent.  A  summary  of  financial  management, \nprocurement,  corruption,  and  governance  risks  in  the  road  subsector  is  provided  in  the \nsupplementary linked document.11 The assessment carried out for the project concludes that \ncorruption risk is above average (para. 29). DPWH has begun intensive efforts to address \ngovernance issues with assistance from ADB, Australian Agency for International Development, \nthe  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners.  First,  DPWH  adopted  an  Integrity \nDevelopment Action Plan in 2005. Second, an Integrity Development Review was conducted in \n2006, which resulted in an action plan on which DPWH reports to the Office of the Ombudsman. \nThird, a separate integrity development action plan consisting of 22 steps was proposed to \nprevent corruption through education, deterrence, and partnerships with NGOs and civil society. \nFourth, an integrity strengthening action plan was prepared for the World Bank's National Roads \nImprovement and Management Program Phase 2, incorporating a comprehensive range of \nmeasures designed to build institutional capacity and governance, to strengthen the fiduciary \ncontrols over the use of loan proceeds, and to strengthen social accountability and the demand \nfor good governance from civil society. ADB has also provided technical assistance to support \nDPWH\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  governance  through  provision  of  a  procurement  advisor,  and \nstrengthening internal and external accountability.12 \n \n12.  The project will reinforce joint efforts to improve the maintenance, investment, capacity, \nand governance issues facing the road subsector. The project will address the maintenance \nfinancing  shortfall  by  financing  periodic  maintenance  of  nine  national  roads.  The  periodic \nmaintenance, primarily through the provision of new overlays on the existing road surfaces, will \nensure that these infrastructure assets are preserved, while other development partners will \nfocus on improving the sustainability of road maintenance funding. The project will address the \ninadequate investment in the national highway network by financing detailed engineering design \nfor  improvement  of  national  roads  to  be  implemented  under  future  projects.  The  large \ninstitutional capacity development component of the project will address capacity shortcomings \nin DPWH central planning and monitoring functions, as well as in district offices, thus supporting \nthe  government\u2019s  decentralization  initiative.  As  part  of  the  project,  DPWH  has  agreed  to \nimplement the Anti-Corruption Action Plan, which focuses on increasing the transparency of \n                                                 \n11  Sector Governance Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  ADB.  2009.

The  project  provides  the  means  for  ADB\u2019s  reengagement  in  the  Philippine  road \nsubsector,  and  is  ADB\u2019s  first  loan  for  the  Philippines  road  subsector  since  1996.13  The \nreengagement  will  enable  ADB  to  support  the  government\u2019s  initiatives  to  address  issues \nhindering subsector performance and to improve the subsector productivity. As part of this re-\nengagement,  ADB  provided  an  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  address  governance \nissues in the road subsector and ensure successful implementation of future projects (footnote \n12). The project is designed to facilitate ADB\u2019s engagement in the subsector over the medium-\nterm through readiness to utilize additional financing based on project performance criteria \n(para. 23). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be improved accessibility of transport infrastructure and services. The \noutcome will be that DPWH manages the road network in the project area more effectively. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The outputs will include (i) periodic maintenance of about 340 km of nine national roads, \n(ii) detailed engineering design of 3 roads to be maintained under the project and other roads to \nbe maintained or  improved under future projects, and (iii) strengthened institutional capacity in \nthe road subsector.  \n \n16.  Periodic maintenance. Periodic maintenance will be carried out on about 340 km of \nnine national roads, consisting of 11 road sections, located in the west coast of Luzon, the \nVisayas, and Mindanao.  The roads proposed for inclusion in the project were selected through \na prioritization exercise carried out by the project preparatory technical assistance consultants in \ncollaboration with DPWH. The selection was based on economic return and the minimization of \nsafeguard issues. The selected roads are part of a major effort to preserve and improve the \nnational road network, included in the Philippines Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 and part of a \nlarger group of roads chosen for improvement by development partners including the World \nBank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency.  \n  \n17.  Detailed design. The project will finance preparation of detailed engineering design for \n101 km of 3 road sections to be maintained under the project and 847 km of national roads to \nbe maintained or improved as part of future projects proposed for ADB financing, including \nthrough the use of additional financing if the project performs well. \n \n18.  Institutional capacity development. A key output of the project will be institutional \ncapacity development of DPWH. Activities to be financed by the project under this output are \npart of a joint effort by development partners to improve DPWH\u2019s capacity and performance of \nthe road subsector. Capacity development activities were developed in coordination with the \nother key development partners and DPWH to ensure that they are complementary and do not \noverlap.  Core  activities  include  (i) institutionalizing  the  road  maintenance  and  management \nsystem; (ii) enhancing the traffic accident recording and analysis system and improving the road \nsafety audit system; (iii) developing and installing a project management information system; \n(iv) strengthening  DPWH's  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  capability  and \nmainstreaming gender in DPWH's infrastructure development; (v) improving communication \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1996.

Terms \nof reference for the capacity development subcomponents are in the project administration \nmanual (PAM).14 \n \n19.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from the experiences of ADB and \nother development partners in the road subsector. Based on the experience of World Bank-\nfinanced road projects, ADB is financing a procurement advisor to monitor the integrity of project \nprocurement and to assist DPWH in the procurement. To address the lessons from ADB\u2019s last \nroad subsector project (footnote 13), the institutional capacity development component will \nstrengthen DPWH\u2019s capacity for safeguards compliance through improvement of right-of-way \nand environmental management. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n20.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $62  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during the implementation to be capitalized in the loan), and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan will not be used \nfor taxes and duties or for land acquisition. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made on reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n                                                 \n14  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n \n \n22.

Implementation Arrangements \n23.  DPWH will be the executing agency. It will establish a project steering committee to \nprovide overall guidance for project implementation. The existing ADB project management \noffice (PMO) will be directly responsible for the implementation of civil works, engineering \ndesigns, and project coordination. The PMO director will act as full-time project director and be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the project. The environment and social services \noffice of DPWH will be responsible for implementation of the environmental and social aspects \nof the project. Additional financing by ADB may be considered if the project performs well. The \nproject includes detailed design of future road periodic maintenance and improvements to \nfacilitate readiness for additional financing and to provide a strong incentive for successful \nproject implementation.  \n \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM.   \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2011\u2013December 2015 \nEstimated completion date  December 2015 (loan closing date: June 2016) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  DPWH \nUndersecretary for PMO operations (chair)  \nRepresentatives from Department of Finance, Department of Budget and \nManagement, and National Economic and Development Authority (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  DPWH \n(iii)  Key implementing  DPWH will be the lead implementing agency.

", "7 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.  The project will support the existing national road network and road subsector through \nperiodic maintenance of selected national roads and strengthened institutional capacity. The \nproject will implement periodic maintenance of existing national roads and prepare detailed \nengineering  designs  of  roads  to  be  maintained  or  improved  under  the  project  and  future \nprojects. The maintenance of national roads under the project will result in longer asset lives, \nlower transport costs, shorter travel times, and improved road safety. The selection of roads for \ninclusion  in  the  project  and  the  development  of  investment  costs  were  carried  out  in \ncollaboration with DPWH. \n \nB.  Economic  \n26.  The project will benefit road users and communities living within the areas of influence of \nthe national roads to be maintained under the project. Road users will benefit directly from \nreduced vehicle operating costs, shorter travel times, and improved road safety. Communities in \nthe areas of influence will benefit indirectly through improved connectivity with better access to \nmarkets, economic opportunities, and government and other social services (such as education \nand health). The project will also generate economic benefits by strengthening the institutional \ncapacity of DPWH. This will lead to lower costs for future road projects and better quality of road \nconstruction and maintenance, resulting in longer lives for road assets. These benefits will \naccrue to road users in general and to the Philippine economy. \n \n27.  Each  of  the  investments  under  the  project  is  economically  viable  when  costs  are \ncompared with the expected benefits to road users from reduced vehicle operating costs and \nsavings in travel time. The project as a whole has an economic internal rate of return of 36.2% \nand a net present value of $161.2 million, using a 12% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis shows \nthat  these  results  are  robust  with  respect  to  negative  changes  in  the  key  parameters \ndetermining benefits and costs. Under the worst-case scenario of a 20% increase in costs and a \n20% decrease in benefits, the project still yields an economic internal rate of return of 27.1%. \n \n28.  Continuing routine maintenance for the roads covered by the project is essential for the \nachievement of the anticipated economic benefits. Inadequate funding of road maintenance has \nbeen  a  long-standing  problem.  The  government,  with  the  support  of  the  World  Bank,  is \naddressing  the  issue  of  sustainable  funding  for  road  maintenance  by  strengthening  the \noperation of the road board and expanding the revenue base for and efficiency of use of the \nspecial funds collected from the users of motor vehicles. The project will also support improved \nimplementation of road maintenance through institutionalization of the road maintenance and \nmanagement system. \n \nC.  Governance \n29.  A governance assessment for the transport sector was undertaken as part of the due \ndiligence process and is summarized in the sector governance risk assessment (footnote 11). It \nconcluded that the corruption risk for the project is above average and that DPWH is widely \nperceived as an agency where corruption is prevalent. Risks identified relate to poor public \nexpenditure and financial management, weaknesses in public procurement, and corruption. A \ngovernance risk mitigation plan is included in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15  \n \n                                                 \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "8 \n \n30.  DPWH  is  committed  to  implementing  various  reforms  and  introducing  measures  to \nreduce these risks and to mitigate their effects, particularly through the introduction of e-based \nsystems for procurement and financial management practices that will increase transparency \nand reduce the potential for corruption. ADB and other development partners are supporting \nDPWH in these efforts by building capacity and strengthening the role of civil society in the \nmonitoring of DPWH performance. ADB has provided TA to support the implementation of the \ngovernance components included in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote \n12). This includes assistance with project procurement through provision of a procurement \nadvisor and other measures related to internal auditing and civil society monitoring. The Project \nincludes  specific  measures  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency,  included  in  an \nanticorruption action plan.16 DPWH has agreed to implement the anticorruption action plan by \nproject completion. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  DPWH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The project is a general intervention with indirect poverty reduction impacts which will \nresult  from  the  lowering  of  transport  costs  for  local  people  and  agricultural  produce,  and \nimproving access to social services and economic opportunities. The project will also provide \nsome opportunities to recruit local labor during construction and road maintenance. The project \nis classified as some gender benefits. Potential gender equity benefits are women\u2019s improved \naccess to social services and income opportunities. For project-related employment, men and \nwomen will be equally paid for work of equal value, and no child labor will be employed. The \ninstitutional  capacity  development  output  will  also  include  raising  the  awareness  and \nprominence of gender issues in DPWH activities. \n \n33.  A potential adverse social impact is the increased risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS and \nother sexually transmitted infections, given that improved transport infrastructure can provide \nthe opportunity for people to interact and engage in behaviors that put them at risk of such \ninfections. Also, the presence of construction workers during implementation of civil works can \ncontribute to the spread of such infections in communities near construction camps and in the \nworkers\u2019  communities  of  origin.  To  address  this  risk,  DPWH  will  ensure  that  HIV/AIDS \nawareness  and  prevention  activities  are  conducted  for  local  communities  and  construction \nworkers. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n34.  The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B  and  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE)17 was prepared consistent with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).  The  IEE  does  not  identify  any  major  environmental  concerns  due  to \nconstruction and operation of the project roads. Works will be undertaken within existing rights-\nof-way with no road widening or realignment. The IEE includes an environmental management \nplan  (EMP),  which  details  the  mitigation  measures,  environmental  monitoring  activities, \ninstitutional  responsibilities,  and  environmental  management  capacity  building.  Public \nconsultations  were  held  in  all  project  provinces  and  along  all  project  roads  and  included \ninterviews and meetings with the affected people. The results of the consultations were positive, \nwith people considering that the roads will bring significant economic benefits to the region and \n                                                 \n16 Anticorruption Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \n \nwill increase trade flows. DPWH will ensure that relevant EMP provisions are included in bid and \ncontract  documents  for  detailed  design,  project  supervision,  and  civil  works.  During \nconstruction, the supervision consultant will assist the environment and social services office of \nDPWH  in  monitoring  the  contractor\u2019s  environmental  performance  and  overall  EMP \nimplementation. DPWH will submit semiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB; these \nreports will be posted on ADB\u2019s website for public disclosure. DPWH will establish a grievance \nredress  mechanism  to  ensure  that  complaints  of  affected  persons  and  other  stakeholders \nregarding the project\u2019s environmental performance are promptly addressed. \n \n35.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. No resettlement will be required as the project provides only periodic maintenance on \nexisting alignments. No impacts on indigenous peoples are expected to occur as a result of the \nproject.   \n \nF.  Risk and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The main risks associated with the project relate to poor governance and, in particular, \ncorruption. DPWH has shown strong commitment to improve governance in the transport sector \nand is committed to implementing the risk assessment and risk management plan with the \nsupport of an ADB-funded TA (footnote 12). The risk assessment and risk management plan \ntargets risks that are (i) considered of critical importance to the project and to the transport \nsector, and (ii) likely to occur in the absence of mitigation. The governance component of the \nplan  focuses  on  preventing  corruption  during  procurement,  and  strengthening  internal  and \nexternal accountability mechanisms. It builds on and complements DPWH\u2019s ongoing efforts to \nimprove governance in association with other development partners. In addition, the project \nincludes an anticorruption action plan, which details specific actions that DPWH will undertake \nto mitigate the risk of corruption during project implementation. \n \n37.  Failure to improve funding for, and delivery of, road maintenance would pose a technical \nrisk for the project and undermine the sustainability of its investments. The government is \nstrongly committed to increasing the funding available for road maintenance and is seeking to \nmitigate this risk through strengthening the road board and widening its revenue base from \nroad-user charges, with assistance from the World Bank. Delivery of road maintenance will be \nimproved through the implementation of the road maintenance and management system under \nthe institutional capacity development output of the project. \n \n38.  A social risk is the possible spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases \nduring and after project implementation. This risk will be mitigated by an HIV/AIDS awareness \nand  prevention  campaign  aimed  at  civil  works  contractors  and  their  workers,  and  local \ncommunities. \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan. The benefits and impacts of the mitigating \nmeasures are expected to outweigh the costs associated with their implementation.  \n \n   \n ", "10 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPoor financial management  Implementation of the governance components of the risk assessment \nand risk management plan and technical assistance (TA) \nWeaknesses in procurement process  Implementation of the governance components of the risk assessment \nand risk management plan and TA \nCorruption  Implementation of the governance components of the risk assessment \nand risk management plan, and TA \nInadequate road maintenance   Strengthening of the road board and widening of its revenue base from \nspecial funds; institutionalization of the road maintenance and \nmanagement system \nHIV/AIDS  Awareness and prevention activities to be undertaken \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES   \n40.  The government and DPWH have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n41.  The  government  and  DPWH  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  specific  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement. No disbursements for civil works will be made \nuntil the OFID loan agreement has been signed and made effective.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.
