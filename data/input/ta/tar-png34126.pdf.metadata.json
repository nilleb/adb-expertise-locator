INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the Country Programming Mission in May 2001, the Government of Papua New \nGuinea (PNG) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance \n(TA) to support capacity building for improved economic statistics in the country. Accordingly, a \nTA for this purpose was included in the 2002 program of ADB assistance.1 A mission visited Port \nMoresby, PNG, on 4\u201316 August 2002. It reached an understanding with the Government on the \nobjective, scope, implementation and financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the \nTA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The primary responsibility in PNG for compiling and reporting socioeconomic statistics \nrests with the National Statistical Office (NSO). NSO was established by an act of Parliament \nand is the central agency in PNG responsible for providing statistical information to meet the \nneeds of government and the community. Over the last few years, NSO's capacity related to \nproduction of quality and timely economic statistics has deteriorated significantly.  \n \n3.  The poor quality of economic statistics in PNG is a major concern. The national accounts \nstatistics  are  based  on  very  limited  sources  of  basic  data  and  rely  heavily  on  indirect \nextrapolation of benchmark estimates. In particular, the estimation of agriculture and informal \nsector production is extremely weak and relies on outdated and unreliable benchmarks. There \nhas been no formal agricultural census in PNG since its independence in 1975. The quality of \ntrade  and  government  finance  statistics  is  also  poor  due  to  poor  data  quality  and  weak \nprocessing ability. The consumer price index (CPI) in PNG is woefully outdated. It is based on a \nhousehold income and expenditure survey conducted in 1975\u20131976. The exchange rate has \ndevalued by more than three-fold since 1996,2 with profound impact on the consumption basket. \nThus, the CPI no longer reflects the current basket of goods consumed by households. In \ngeneral, NSO\u2019s preparation of almost all its regular economic statistics has been delayed: the \nnational accounts statistics beyond 1999 have not been prepared. Even preliminary information \non  trade  statistics  for  the  period  beyond  1998  is  yet  to  be  compiled,  partly  due  to  weak \ncomputation and information technology skills in NSO. \n \n4.  The  weakness  of  economic  statistics  is  related  to  poor  skill  level,  outdated  data \nprocessing systems, and poor links between NSO and suppliers of data. Delay in conduct of \nmany critical statistical activities and preparation of statistics constrained the more senior NSO \nstaff from keeping their knowledge and skills updated. At the same time, new staff had no \nopportunity to learn and practice needed skills. Because of the long delay, the capacity and skill \nof the NSO staff to conduct household surveys and poverty analysis have become weak and \noutdated. This is critical, as NSO may have to do a detailed nationwide assessment of poverty \nin the medium term. The computer software and programs being used for data processing in \nNSO are outdated, and most staff computers are not on a common network and do not have \naccess to the Internet. An opportunity has arisen for better connectivity and use of new software \nas  NSO  has  received  many  new  computers  under  the  population  census  2000  project \nsupported by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID).  \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 15 May 2002 with the name \n\"Improving National Accounts and Statistics.\"  \n2 World Bank conducted a socioeconomic survey with poverty focus in 1996 (World Bank. 1996. Papua New Guinea \n1996 Household Survey. Washington D.C.). The Government did not accept its findings until 1999. ", "2 \n5.  A substantial part of the weakness of statistical systems in PNG is related to deficiencies \nin data collection, arising in part from the weak linkages between NSO and key departments \nand agencies at central and provincial levels. At the central level, the key suppliers of data \ninclude  the  Department  of  Treasury,  Bank  of  Papua  New  Guinea,  Department  of  Mining, \nDepartment of Petroleum and Energy, Department of Agriculture and Livestock, and Internal \nRevenue Commission. The agencies that supply information to NSO also need to be supported \nand strengthened to enable them to provide quality data within the required time frame. Further, \nthere are opportunities to use administrative data, which could reduce the cost of production of \nmany economic statistics, and/or contribute to improvements in their quality.  \n \n6.  A  long  period  of  suboptimal  performance  has  also  resulted  in  significant  systemic \ndeterioration. Overall, the reliability, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of economic statistics \nfall short of the requirements of the policy makers and the private sector. Both from international \nand  regional  standards,  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  economic  statistics  in  PNG  need  to \nimprove urgently in several ways. \n  \n7.  A major factor underlying these weaknesses has been the assignment of low priority to \neconomic statistics. Over the last two years, however, economic statistics has emerged as a \nmajor concern within the Government and the funding agencies, largely due to the demand \ngenerated by the recent reforms. Accordingly, the priority assigned to economic statistics in \nPNG has changed remarkably, which is reflected in allocation of additional budget resources to \nNSO for this purpose in 2002. At the same time, AusAID has provided a policy and planning \nadviser to assist NSO since April 2002. With near completion of the 2000 population census, \nNSO is willing and well-placed to respond to these concerns.3 Currently, NSO\u2019s Economic \nStatistics Division (ESD) is not receiving any other external assistance.  \n \n8.  By improving the quality and timing of economic information, the TA aims to strengthen \nmacroeconomic management and policy and planning decisions in the government. Further, \nmore reliable and timely statistics are expected to reduce market uncertainty, improve resource \nallocation, and support private sector development in PNG. ADB strategies for PNG and the \nPacific region emphasize poverty reduction through public sector reforms and private sector \ndevelopment. Thus, the TA is in line with the regional and country-specific strategies of ADB. \nThe  assignment  of  higher  priority  to  economic  statistics  by  the  Government  provides  an \nopportunity to enhance NSO\u2019s performance, and the timing of the proposed TA is appropriate. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The broad objective of the TA will be to strengthen NSO\u2019s capacity for collecting and \ncompiling  economic  and  social  statistics,  including  national  accounts  and  the  CPI,  on  a \nsustainable basis. \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The  TA  will  strengthen  and  upgrade  NSO's  capacity  for  preparing  all  its  regular \neconomic  statistics.  The  regular  economic  statistics  of  NSO  include  national  accounts, \ngovernment finance statistics, CPI, international trade (exports and imports), business survey, \n                                                 \n3 This has been manifested in NSO\u2019s improved output during 2002, which included completing the business census \n1998.  The  compilation  of  the  national  accounts  1994\u20132000  and  the  2001  business  census  are  currently \nprogressing. \n ", "    3 \nand building construction index. The TA will support updating of the benchmark values for the \nnational accounts based on more comprehensive data, including the population census 2000 \nand new business census,4 and by improving the quality and coverage of data. The TA will also \nsupport change in the base year of the national accounts to a more recent year, and upgrading \nof the business register. In addition, the TA will build capacity of NSO for preparing additional \nstatistics, such as quarterly production indicators (possibly quarterly gross domestic product), \nnational accounts aggregates (including gross national income), wholesale price index, export-\nimport price index, labor and employment statistics, saving-investment statistics, etc., as agreed \nwith NSO. Efforts will be made to ensure sustainability by developing cost effective techniques. \nA major component of the TA will be to support and strengthen the capacity to conduct a \nhousehold expenditure survey for rebasing the CPI, provision of basic data for direct estimation \nof private consumption expenditure in the national accounts, and poverty analysis. The TA will \nsupport a price survey for preparing the rebased CPI. The TA will also review the existing \nsystems and make suggestions to institutionalize the improvements and ensure sustainability of \neconomic statistics. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will upgrade data collection, computation, and processing capabilities of NSO \nstaff. The staff of key suppliers of data will also be covered in this exercise, as necessary. \nRegarding data collection, the TA activities will focus on survey activities and strengthening \nNSO's  linkages  with  other  departments  and  agencies  at  central  and  provincial  levels. \nAccordingly, the TA will support common or agency-specific training, seminars, and workshops \nbetween NSO and key suppliers and users of data. Further, efforts will be made to establish or \nstrengthen linkages and systems for obtaining relevant administrative data on a regular basis. \nThe strengthening of computation skills will include development or provision of appropriate \nsoftware  and  training.  Regarding  processing  capabilities,  the  TA  will  focus  on  upgrading \nknowledge and analytical abilities. \n \n12.  These will be achieved under the TA through extension of advisory services, hands-on \ntraining, organization of workshops and seminars, direct funding of some survey activities, and \nsupply of computer-related hardware and software. The TA will also fund special studies related \nto identified gaps and areas of weakness. During TA implementation, the TA will support \noperation and maintenance of selected hardware, including the local area network and the \ncomputer server to be provided under the TA. Emphasis will be placed on strengthening the \ncomputation and information technology skills in the NSO. Training in computer skills will be \norganized using local expertise and/or expertise from regional agencies such as the Secretariat \nof the Pacific Community, Noumea, and the Statistical Institute for Asia and Pacific (SIAP), \nTokyo.  Priority  will  be  given  to  use  of  local  skills.  To  institutionalize  changes  and  ensure \nsustainability,  the  TA  will  prepare  detailed  documentation  of  procedures  of  all  activities \nundertaken during the TA implementation. The TA will also support strengthening of the data \ndissemination process through public forums, data dissemination seminars, and the media. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.394 million equivalent, of which $638,000 is \nthe foreign exchange cost and $756,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will finance \nan amount equivalent to $800,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $162,000 \n                                                 \n4  According to NSO\u2019s revised plan, the business census will be conducted at intervals of 3 years. The 2001 business \ncensus is currently ongoing, and the next one will be due in 2004.  ", "4 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the remaining cost of $594,000 equivalent to \ncover  the  local  currency  costs  related  to  conduct  of  the  household  expenditure  survey, \ncounterpart staff, office space for the consultants, and other local support. The cost estimates \nare shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB's Pacific Department, in close coordination with the Development Indicators and \nPolicy Research Division (ERDI) of ADB's Economics and Research Department (ERD), will \nadminister the TA.  In PNG, the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, through NSO, \nwill be the Executing Agency for the TA. The national statistician will be the contact person for \nADB.  \n \n15.  A steering committee will be set up to provide overall guidance and direction to the \nimplementation of the TA. The composition of the steering committee will be on the same lines, \nalbeit smaller, as the one set up for the national population census 2000, and include key data \nproducer and user departments and agencies. The secretary, National Planning and Monitoring, \nand the national statistician will serve as the ex-officio chairman and member secretary of the \nsteering  committee,  respectively.  Other  department  heads  of  selected  departments  and \nagencies  will  be  the  members,  while  NSO  will  serve  as  the  technical  secretariat  of  the \ncommittee. A users advisory committee composed of the representatives of key data producer \nand user departments and agencies will also support TA implementation. NSO will also serve as \nthe technical secretariat of the users advisory committee.  \n \n16.  ADB will provide about 24 person-months of international consulting services including \nfor national accounts and other economic statistics, sampling and survey, data processing and \ncomputer skills, price statistics, and poverty assessment. A domestic consultant will be engaged \nto  render  service  on  an  intermittent  basis  for  about  2  person-months  to  ensure  proper \naccounting of expenditure of funds provided to the Government by ADB. The outline terms of \nreference are given in Appendix 3. The Government will provide counterpart staff, office space, \nand other local support for the team of consultants. The Government will finance most of the \ncost of the household expenditure survey. However, ADB will provide supplementary financing \nfor data collection activities, including the household expenditure survey. ADB will also provide \noffice equipment, computer software, and their operation and maintenance during the period of \nTA implementation. \n \n17.  ADB funds will be disbursed to NSO as necessary. NSO will receive cash advances \nfrom ADB periodically by submitting proposed activities and estimated expenditures. NSO will \nregularly provide ADB with liquidation statements of expenditure. \n \n18.  Upon  TA  inception,  the  team  leader,  in  consultation  with  the  authorities  and  in \ncollaboration with other consultants, particularly the sampling and survey specialist, will prepare \na time-bound TA implementation work plan with clear milestones. The sampling and survey \nspecialist will separately formulate a detailed timetable and work plan for the preparation, \nconduct, and analysis of the household expenditure survey, and provide a copy to the team \nleader, which will be incorporated in the TA implementation work plan. The sampling and survey \nspecialist will assist the Government in making the final determination of the geographical \ncoverage of the survey, which will be reflected in the work plan.  While implementing the TA, the \nconsultants will individually or collectively make periodic field visits. The team will focus on \ntransferring skills to staff rather than serving in line positions in NSO. Further, to maintain ", "    5 \ncontinuity,  the  consultants  will  extend  advice  and  guidance  from  their  home  office,  as \nnecessary. While implementing the TA, efforts will be made to build on past progress and recent \ndevelopments. Efforts will be made to coordinate closely with the activities of ADB's TA 6009-\nREG5 and other externally-funded activities to avoid duplication and overlap. \n \n19.  The TA will commence in November 2002 and be implemented over a 2.5-year period, \nwith completion expected by April 2005. The consultants will be recruited on an individual basis \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nacceptable to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants. Materials and equipment for the \nTA will be purchased in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and arrangements \nacceptable to ADB. All equipment will be turned over to the Government on the completion of \nthe TA. Monitoring and review of TA implementation will be done by ADB missions and through \nregular communications with NSO and other related offices. The consultants will also provide \nreports in accordance with the terms of reference. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Papua New Guinea for Improving Economic and Social Statistics, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2001.
