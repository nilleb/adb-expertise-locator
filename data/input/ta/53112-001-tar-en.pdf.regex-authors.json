INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will operationalize initiatives that \ncatalyze trade and cross-border investment (internationalization) by small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) between India and countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), \ncontributing to enhanced regional integration and higher and more inclusive growth in both the \nGMS and South Asian regions.1 It will focus on Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam among \ncountries in the GMS. The TA builds on recommendations of analytical studies that looked at the \npotential for and challenges of connecting SMEs across Cambodia, India, and Thailand.2 \n \n2.  The TA will seek to do this by (i) establishing and/or partnering with business accelerators \nin  India  and  Thailand  (to  cover  the  GMS)  to  identify  SMEs  with  the  potential  for \ninternationalization;3 and providing the identified SMEs with a composite package, including \ninformation on opportunities, industry expertise, mentoring, and guidance on market entry issues \nto assist their internationalization; (ii) supporting linkages between business associations and/or \norganizations promoting SME internationalization; and (iii) supporting linkages between business \naccelerators and financial intermediaries. \n \n3.  The TA is included in the management approved 2019 results-based work plan of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). It is aligned closely with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 that emphasizes fostering regional \ncooperation  and  integration  among  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries (DMCs).4 The  TA \nsupports the expansion of global and regional trade and investment opportunities.5 It is also in \nagreement with ongoing initiatives by the governments in Cambodia, India, Thailand, and Viet \nNam that support greater integration and development of SMEs. The first prerequisites for the \ninternationalization of SMEs is access to quality infrastructure, a good enabling environment, and \nhelping SMEs to grow and become competitive. Therefore, this TA will complement a proposed \ndevelopment program for SMEs in India,6 and similar programs aimed at SMEs in other target \ncountries. Although the TA will be implemented over 2 years, it will be designed to attract financing \nfrom other public and private sources to allow activities to be sustained over the medium term. \nThe TA will also impact poverty because it will support raising growth and productivity in SMEs \nthat generate employment especially for the poor and low-skilled. The TA will also impact gender \nequality because it will make a special effort to support SMEs led and/or owned by women through \nthe accelerator program. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Opportunities. India has been trying to promote economic cooperation and cultural ties \nand develop strategic relationships with countries in Asia and the Pacific through its Act East \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on \n30 October 2019. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Under the TA, country reports were produced for Cambodia, India, and \nThailand. Viet Nam was studied but no formal country report was produced. \n3  A business accelerator is a program that gives developing companies access to mentorship, investors, and other \nsupport that help them grow their businesses. \n4 ADB. 2018.

Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2019\u2013\n2024. Manila.  \n6  At the request of the Government of India, ADB is developing a support program based on the concept of value \nchain-based cluster development. This will likely include infrastructure interventions and strengthening of institutional \nand regulatory frameworks. This is targeted for approval in 2020. \n ", "2 \nPolicy.7 The GMS offers particular potential for stronger economic relations, as it is close to India \nand has historical and cultural connections. Trade and investment between India and the GMS \nare low, but there are large potential gains to both from integration, in terms of boosting growth, \nemployment, and resilience. Closer integration with GMS countries offers opportunities for India \nto diversify its exports, and better link with the global value chains (GVCs) centered in East Asia. \nFor GMS countries, India offers a large and growing market, and could be a source of inward \nforeign direct investment. Increased integration with India is an important part of the strategies of \nGMS countries as well.8 \n \n5.  SMEs will need to be an integral part of any strategy to link India and the GMS. The main \nattraction for Indian firms looking to enter the GMS is access to GVCs, which is likely to be a big \ndraw for SMEs looking to internationalize.9 Similarly, the large market in India is a big draw for \nSMEs in Thailand.10 Participation of SMEs can help deepen integration and make benefits more \ninclusive by creating more and better jobs. International experience shows that enhancing \ninvolvement with global markets is key to strengthening the competitiveness of SMEs and their \ncontribution to economic development, job creation, and social well-being. \n \n6.  The study and follow-up demand. In 2017, the Government of India requested ADB to \nconduct a study on how to promote trade and investment through SMEs between India and the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in particular Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam \n(footnote 2). In response, in 2018 ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Thematic Group \n(SDTC-RCI) produced country reports on Cambodia, India, and Thailand to understand the push-\nand-pull factors that lead SMEs to internationalize; the constraints SMEs in the region face in \ninternationalizing; and the support they need to undertake this successfully. The reports found \nthat there is significant scope for SMEs to become more integrated across India and the GMS. A \nreasonably  large  number  of  SMEs  in  all  economies  covered  in  this  TA  are  already \ninternationalized,  and  regularly  conduct  overseas  business,  either  in  the  form  of  trade  or \ninvestment. Further, a significant number of SMEs show the potential to be internationalized.11 \nThere are many opportunities for Indian SMEs to conduct business in the GMS countries involving \napparel, autoparts, information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services, pharmaceuticals, and \nleather. There is also considerable interest in the GMS to conduct business in India involving \nautoparts, agro-processing, IT and IT-enabled services, logistics, and wellness; some areas of \nfocus (e.g., autoparts and apparel) are characterized by the presence of GVCs. \n \n7.  An agreement has been secured from the DMC governments covered in this TA on \nactioning report recommendations. In addition, the team for this TA has held consultations with \nprivate sector stakeholders, who expressed a strong need to move forward with a project that \ngives momentum to nascent but growing business-to-business contact between India and the \nGMS countries. \n \n8.  Challenges. The first challenge is to vitalize SMEs and enhance their competitiveness \nthrough infrastructure development, adequate institutional and regulatory support, and access to \n \n7  The objective of the policy is to promote economic cooperation and cultural ties and develop strategic relationship \nwith countries in the Asia and Pacific region through trade, culture, people-to-people contacts, and physical \ninfrastructure.

This requires interventions by governments in support of SME development. Some \ngrowth-oriented SMEs may then seek to internationalize as part of their growth strategy.12 This \nmay require additional support from private sector stakeholders. Entering a foreign market can be \nexpensive,  time-consuming,  and  risky,  while  SMEs  typically  have  limited  resources.  Not \nsurprisingly, SMEs tend to be hesitant globalizers, even when the benefits are significant, and for \nthis  reason  require  support.  To  understand  the  main  challenges  that  SMEs  face  in \ninternationalizing, the RCI TG reports presented the results of a survey of about 1,200 SMEs and \nface-to-face  interviews  with  key  informants.13  The  reports  identified  the  following  primary \nproblems (footnotes 9 and 10): \n(i)  Information  and  capacity  constraints  among  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. The survey and interviews reveal a significant gap in information \namong SMEs in both India and the GMS. Most SMEs from one region, either India \nor the GMS, do not know what to expect in the other region or are misinformed of \nprospects.  There  are  few  sources  to  fill  this  gap:  established  contacts  with \nsuppliers and business partners, or peers who are trading across India and the \nGMS. SMEs also are not fully aware of trade agreements, how to take advantage \nof these, or of e-commerce opportunities. Further, trade or investment promotion \nagencies from the destination country typically do not actively reach out to SMEs. \nThe lack of prior exposure to the other region also means that SMEs require \nguidance and assistance when venturing abroad. There is a need to demonstrate \nearly  successes  and  risk  mitigation  through  internationalization  of  SMEs  to \npersuade other SMEs to purse internationalization. \n(ii)  Weak  coordination  among  organizations  supporting  small  and medium-\nsized  enterprises  moving  across  borders. Most  SMEs  wish to  enter  new \nmarkets through joint ventures with local businesses. Finding a good business \npartner was reported as a critical factor for successful entry. However, there are \nfew  links  between  destination  and  origin  country  business  associations  and \norganizations that support SMEs, resulting in limited information sharing and \ncoordination,  which  renders  making  effective  contacts  between  SMEs  and \nconducting follow-up difficult. \n(iii)  Underdeveloped  support  ecosystems  for  internationalizing  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises.  High-potential  SMEs  need  access  to  support \nnetworks that combine acceleration and financing. While there are specialized \ninstitutions offering financing for internationalizing SMEs (export-import banks and \nventure capital funds), these are not well connected with accelerators that can \ncreate a pipeline of internationalizing SMEs with financeable business plans. In the \nabsence of this link, the results of such financing facilities have been mixed. Global \nevidence suggests that deepening relationships, promoting collaboration, and \nimproving information flows between stakeholders produce large benefits.14 \n \n \n12 For example, Cranes Software International from India invested in Singapore to support its relationship with Texas \nInstruments and has used this as a base to serve many countries in ASEAN. Similarly, Indian companies\u2014such as \nFrost International; Teledata Informatic (IT); Commeasure (hospitality); Grofers (grocery delivery); and AdNear \n(mobile advertising network)\u2014have started operations in ASEAN to access international markets, supplement export \nactivities, or expand their product portfolio. \n13 Explained in Supplementary Document 3-Key Capacity-Building Needs of Internationalizing Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprises (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n14 While much has been done through trade finance programs with banks, the less benign global environment on cross-\nborder trade and investment requires additional regional efforts. Instead of producing credit lines for such agencies, \na more SME portfolio-intensive approach is likely to support financing objectives for SMEs more meaningfully. \n ", "4 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: movement of internationalized SMEs between \nIndia and the GMS increased.15 The TA will have the following outcome: internationalization of \nSMEs supported.16 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1:  International business accelerators established. The TA will run twin \ninternational business accelerators (IBAs) in Thailand and India to offer SMEs support services \nthey need, that will (i) identify potential SMEs willing and potentially able to move; (ii) identify their \ncapacity-building needs and provide suitable training, including on strengthening management, \nstandards, rules of origin, and the use of e-commerce; (iii) help SMEs create and implement a \nfinanceable business plan and link the plan to potential sources of finance; (iv) connect SMEs \nwith professional networks in the destination that can mentor them through issues of market entry; \n(v) create a roster of certified business service providers at the destination (lawyers, accountants, \nand business consultants); and (vi) track SMEs graduating from the program, and report on \nachievements. The IBAs model will (i) act on a \u201ctwin basis\u201d by catering to GMS companies and \nproviding  them  the  services  and  facilities  they  need  to  quickly,  conveniently,  reliably,  and \naffordably launch initial operations in a foreign country (i.e., India) as well as help Indian SMEs in \nsetting up in the GMS; (ii) specifically target India\u2013GMS internationalization;17 (iii) make a special \neffort to target SMEs led and/or owned by women through support for the accelerator program;18 \nand (iv) provide a special focus on ensuring sustainability of the accelerator beyond the TA. \nCambodia and Viet Nam are expected to benefit mainly through increased trade and inward \nforeign direct investment from India, although the IBA will also reach out to SMEs in Cambodia \nand Viet Nam that may be interested in the Indian market. The IBAs will proactively reach out to \nindustries prioritized by the respective governments and identified as having potential but will rely \non business associations to identify potential SMEs. The IBAs will subsequently also reach out to \nother sources, including SMEs benefiting from government programs. \n \n11.  Output 2: Cooperation between India and the Greater Mekong Subregion countries\u2019 \nbusiness  associations  and/or  organizations  supporting  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises facilitated. The TA will organize at least two business match-making events jointly \nwith GMS and Indian business associations and/or organizations supporting SMEs. These events \nwill (i) identify SMEs interested in entering the accelerator program and finding potential business \npartners in the destination country; (ii) connect SMEs in the accelerator program with potential \nbusiness partners in the destination country; (iii) reach out to chambers of commerce and \nbusiness associations for women-owned businesses; (iv) be used to improve information flows, \n \n15 Movement refers to increased activity, either in the form of increased exports, receiving inward foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI), or making outward FDI. It includes the possibility of indirect internationalization. For example, \nIndian SMEs may choose to enter GMS markets indirectly through other destinations, such as Singapore or Hong \nKong, China. \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n17 The IBA model has emerged as a common mechanism to support entrepreneurial expansion, including in the target \nDMCs. However existing accelerators do not target India\u2013GMS internationalization, which is the focus of this TA. \n18 The TA will coordinate with and benefit from cross-learning from ADB. 2018.

Manila.  \n ", "5 \nincluding use of emerging technologies in streamlining and simplifying cross-border regulations,19 \nand coordination between the associations on a sustained basis; and (v) identify policy reforms \nneeded to facilitate internationalization of SMEs and discuss these with government. To achieve \nsustained results beyond events, (i) IBAs will further support SMEs in following through on the \ninitial contacts made during these events and (ii) the TA will support the establishment of an online \npartnering website to be maintained by the associations on a permanent basis. \n \n12.  Output 3: Coordination between financial intermediaries and accelerators of small \nand medium-sized enterprises strengthened. The TA will organize two workshops that will \nbring together SMEs from the IBA program and specialized financial institutions such as export\u2013\nimport banks and venture funds to generate financing for the SMEs being supported by the IBA. \nThis can help make the IBA sustainable (e.g., by charging a success fee), and help establish a \npartnership to build the foundations for a more comprehensive strategy of regional trade and \ninvestment promotion backed by financial intermediaries focusing on the special needs of SMEs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUnited Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. \n \n14.  Eligible activities for financing include the cost of expert services and related facilities \nrequired for the TA or related operational activities (including staff training and development for \neligible DMCs) to be carried out by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented from December 2019 to December 2021. ADB will be the \nexecuting agency. ADB\u2019s SDTC-RCI will be responsible for administering the TA, with TA \nimplementation oversight co-led by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s Business \nDevelopment Team. In its implementation, a one-ADB approach will be followed by working \nclosely with ADB\u2019s South Asia Department and Southeast Asia Department to leverage their \ngovernment relations, industry knowledge, and sector networks. The TA will leverage and support \na proposed development program for SMEs requested by the Government of India.20 \n \n16.
