THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will support urban sector analyses, \nproject preparation and capacity development, and project due diligence during 2019\u20132021 to a \nseries of urban development investment projects. These projects will comprise the subsectors of: \n(i) urban transport; (ii) urban water, sanitation, and flood control; (iii) solid waste management; (iv) \nlow-income  housing;  (v)  cultural  heritage  restoration;  (vi)  tourism  development;  and  (vii) \ninformation and communications technology (ICT). To develop these projects, preparatory work \nin the form of feasibility studies, environmental and social safeguards work, financial management \nassessments, and economic analyses will be required. The TA facility is included in the current \nCountry Operations Business Plan (COBP), 2019\u20132021, for Pakistan. \n \n2.  Urbanization trends. Pakistan has a current population of over 207.7 million and is \nranked the world\u2019s sixth most populous country.1 Over 75.5 million (or 36%) live in towns and \ncities. The rate of urbanization in Pakistan\u2019s five largest cities during 1998 to 2017 census period \nreveals a population increase of 74%. Infrastructure investments have not kept pace with growth \nand has resulted in increased demand for local governments and utility providers to improve \ninfrastructure and urban management services to meet current needs and future demand. Rapid \nurbanization  is  pressurizing  environmental  quality  across  Pakistan  with  acute  conditions \nregarding urban air pollution, ambient noise, water contamination, and uncontrolled solid waste \ndisposal. Climate change projections show that Pakistan\u2019s temperature increase is expected to \nbe higher than the global average with an increase of 4-6\u00b0C by the end of this century, and that \nrainfall levels are expected to increase by an average of 4 millimeter per day by 2050. Increased \nvariability of precipitation is expected to cause flash flooding that will inundate urban centers.2 \nFuture urban projects thus will increasingly require design for climate resilience. \n \n3.  Government\u2019s strategy. The Government of Pakistan\u2019s stated priority is to transform \ngovernance, especially in terms of local institutional structures. The Vision 2030 and Framework \nfor Economic Growth envisage livable cities as engines of national growth and centers of \neconomic activity, culture, and knowledge.3 The Framework for Economic Growth also recognizes \nthe advantage of local governments in managing urban development, as they are closer to the \nbeneficiary population, better situated to identify citizen\u2019s preferences, and having the flexibility to \nrespond rapidly to cities evolving needs. The current urban governance framework includes a \nplethora  of  local  government,  housing,  and  land  laws  that  often  overlap  and  conflict.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  2010  amendment  of  the  constitution  decentralized  urban  service  delivery  to \nprovincial governments and led to local government law changes in 2013 that enshrined the \ndevolution of urban service delivery to Metropolitan Corporations in large cities and Municipal \nCorporations and Committees in intermediate and smaller cities.4 However, there is insufficient \nurban planning legislation at the national or provincial level to underpin municipal planning \nsystems, which in turn has resulted in unplanned urban growth. The absence of urban planning \nlaw  exacerbates  fragmentation,  poor  spatial  planning,  and  haphazard  development  that  is \ncharacteristic of many cities.  \n \n1  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Statistics. 2017.

Since 1966, ADB has invested over $6.3 billion in Pakistan\u2019s urban \nsector, 84% of which is in urban transport. Lessons learned from recent investment projects \nindicate that: (i) integrated urban projects require holistic improvements to capacity, resources, \nsystems, and infrastructure and a shared commitment by project stakeholders; (ii) government \nownership and commitment are required to make inroads on substantive governance-related \nreforms; and (iii) adequate resourcing is necessary to implement all project activities, including \nflexibility to provide additional financing. A recent project completion report recommended that \nADB carefully assess how provincial strategies for policy and regulatory reforms are being \naddressed  at  the  city  level  and  whether  meaningful  action  is  being  taken  to  address  the \ninstitutional overlap of functions among urban/city authorities.5  \n \n5.  Ensuing  and  ongoing  projects.  The  COBP  2019\u20132021  for  Pakistan  includes \ninvestments to promote at least three operational priorities of ADB Strategy 2030: (i) promote the \ncreation of more livable cities using integrated solutions; (ii) incorporate climate resilience, \nintegrated environmental management, and gender mainstreaming into city planning processes; \nand (iii) strengthen governance and institutional capacity for financial sustainability. The TA facility \nwill support preparatory activities for ensuing projects and innovative aspects of ongoing projects \nin need of further preparatory activities. \n  \n6.  The investment projects that will be supported from this TA facility are: \n \nTable 1: Program of Ensuing and Ongoing Projects \nProposed projects (with ensuing  Description \nand  ongoing  investment \namounts) \nMFF: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cities  The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has set urban development as a \nImprovement  Program  (ensuing  major pillar for economic growth and has requested ADB to support a project to \nproject, $500 million)  improve the quality of life of residents in its most populous cities of Abbottabad, \nKohat, Mardan, Mingora, and Peshawar. The TA facility will support the \ncomponents of conceptual planning and safeguards activities. \nPunjab  Intermediate  Cities  The project will improve the quality of life of the residents in the intermediate \nImprovement Investment Project  cities of Sahiwal and Sialkot in Punjab Province.
