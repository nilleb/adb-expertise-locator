I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Armenia for the Power Transmission Rehabilitation Project.1  \n \n2.   The project will upgrade the national power system to improve reliability and efficiency of \noperations, and enhance transmission capacity. The project includes three main components: (i) \nexpansion  of  the  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  and  energy \nmanagement system (EMS); (ii) rehabilitation of two 220-kilovolt (kV) substations in Agarak 2 \nand Shinuhayr;2 and (iii) support for institutional development, capacity building, and project \nmanagement. The project will increase the supply of electricity to urban and rural consumers to \nsupport inclusive and sustainable economic development.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Armenia has no proven oil or natural gas reserves. It imports most of its fossil fuel \nresources from the Russian Federation (through Georgia) and has begun importing gas from \nIran. Imports account for about 77% of the total primary energy supply,4 and natural gas imports \nfrom the Russian Federation account for 81% of total energy imports. Strengthening energy \nsecurity  and  improving  energy  efficiency  are  the  country\u2019s  top  priorities.  Development  of \nindigenous energy resources and rehabilitation of old and inefficient generation, transmission, \nand distribution infrastructure are critical to the country\u2019s energy security and more importantly \nto sustainable economic growth. \n \n4.  Armenia\u2019s power system has a total installed generation capacity of 4,100 megawatts \n(MW), 74% (3,047 MW) of which is operating. Power generation comprises 31% nuclear, 28% \nhydropower,  and  41%  thermal  power  (using  imported  natural  gas).  The  country  produces \nenough electricity to meet  the annual domestic demand of about 6.0 billion kilowatt-hours \n(kWh). With a population of 3.3 million, it has an electrification ratio of 100%. It also trades \nelectricity with neighboring countries, with exports of electricity exceeding its imports. In 2013, \ntotal electricity output was 7.70 billion kWh. The country exported 1.31 billion kWh, and imported \n0.15 billion kWh. Armenia has a competitive advantage in electricity production because of its \ncheap generation resources and excess capacity, particularly during summer months.5 \n \n5.  Since 2000, the Government of Armenia (the government) has introduced a series of \nenergy sector reforms, which have significantly improved performance. The reforms involved \nunbundling of the vertically integrated electricity subsector, and privatization of the entire power \nand gas distribution networks and most generation companies. The Ministry of Energy and \nNatural Resources (MENR) is responsible for the power subsector, which comprises Electro \nPower  Systems  Operator  (EPSO)  Closed  Joint-Stock  Company,  a  privatized  distribution \ncompany;  the  state-owned  High  Voltage  Electric  Networks  (HVEN)  Closed  Joint-Stock \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Government of Armenia proposed the rehabilitation of four substations: the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill finance the rehabilitation of two substations, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is \nexpected to finance and administer rehabilitation of two substations at Ararat 2 and Yeghegnadzor on a parallel \nbasis. \n3  The ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Power Transmission Rehabilitation \nProject (TA 8198-ARM). \n4  Excluding generation from the nuclear power plant, which is considered a domestic energy source. \n5  Electricity demand in the region is large and growing. Turkey and the southern regions of the Russian Federation \n(bordering Georgia) currently have an electricity deficit that is expected to grow. \n ", "2   \n \nCompany, the state-owned system operator; and more than 50 generation companies, most of \nwhich are privatized. \n \n6.  Key  challenges.  The core problems in the energy sector are the low efficiency of \nenergy resource utilization, and the deteriorating and aging power infrastructure. These are \nevidenced  by  the  very  limited  utilization  of  substantial  renewable  energy  resources,6 low \nefficiency  of  thermal  and  hydropower  plants,  relatively  large  electricity  transmission  and \ngeneration losses, and incomplete realization of electricity export potential. \n \n7.  Much of the sector\u2019s infrastructure was built during the Soviet era and has deteriorated \nsignificantly because of insufficient funding for rehabilitation and maintenance. About 70% of the \ninstalled equipment at power generation plants has been operating for more than 30 years, and \n50%  for  more  than  40  years.  The  average  age  of  power  transmission  assets  including \nsubstations is 45 years, and distribution assets 32 years. Much of the existing transmission \ninfrastructure  has  reached  the  end  of  its  useful  life  and  requires  major  rehabilitation  or \nreplacement  to  continue  reliable  operation.  Nearly  90%  of  220  kV  overhead  lines  require \nrehabilitation, and about 42% of low-voltage substations are in deficient technical condition. \n \n8.  The poor condition of these assets leads to  a higher risk of system outages, high \nmaintenance costs, and reduced production efficiency. The inefficiency of power infrastructure \nresults in higher consumption of imported fuels and reduced competitiveness. If the existing \ntransmission  network  fails,  a  large  power  deficit  will  be  incurred  in  populated  areas  with \nconsiderable social and economic impacts. Additionally, a reliable transmission network with \nmodern equipment is essential to ensure the safe and stable operation of the Armenia Nuclear \nPower Plant (400 MW),7 and to enhance power export to neighboring countries. \n \n9.  To  reduce  such  impacts,  substantial  investments  in  power  infrastructure  including \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution are ongoing. Private sector investment focuses on the \nrehabilitation  of  power  generation  plants  and  distribution  networks,  which  are  owned  and \noperated by the private sector. A part of the high-voltage transmission lines and substations has \nbeen partially rehabilitated, and development partner investment for high-voltage transmission \nlines will continue.8 The first stage of the SCADA system and EMS is in place in the control \ncenter.9 The systems currently only achieve basic functions and need to be upgraded and \nexpanded to achieve full functionality and efficiency.10 Investments in substations have not been \nsufficient  given  the  system  rehabilitation  requirements,  thus  limiting  system  operation  and \nreliability.  Expansion  of  the  SCADA  system  and  rehabilitation  of  the  remaining  aging \ntransmission assets are urgently required. \n \n10.  Priority  areas.  The  government\u2019s  target  is  to  achieve  average  annual  real  gross \ndomestic  product  growth  of  6.5%  through  2025,  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  energy \n                                                \n6   Namely, the small hydropower plants with capacity of less than 10 MW and the wind-power plant. \n7  The Armenia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) was built in the 1970s\u20131980s. The government committed to replace the \nexisting capacity of the plant by building a new NPP of about 1,100 MW. As per the government\u2019s plan, a new NPP \ncould be operating by 2021, which means that the existing plant will be retired after completion of the new unit. In \nAugust 2010, the governments of Armenia and the Russian Federation signed an agreement on construction of a \nnew nuclear power unit in Armenia. \n8  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Financed jointly by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the World Bank in 1999\u20132004.  \n10 SCADA system hardware should be upgraded and supplemented to support enhanced performance and to provide \nprerequisites for enhanced functionality. Software should be upgraded to the latest release to meet state-of-the-art \nEMS  functionality  and  inter-control-center  communication  capability  based  on  international  standard \ncommunication protocols. ", "3 \n \nutilization.11 The sector\u2019s development priority is to upgrade and rehabilitate the transmission \nnetworks. A reliable and efficient power supply system is an essential precondition for ensuring \nachievement of socioeconomic development goals. The government\u2019s energy policy strongly \nsupports increased energy security and greater energy efficiency. \n \n11.  Assistance and sector strategy. The interim operational strategy for Armenia of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) identified the energy sector as a priority sector12 for ADB \nintervention.13 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Armenia is expected to be finalized in \n2014. ADB operations in the sector have been based on government priorities, aligned with \nADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  and  Energy  Policy  2009. 14  They  include  (i) \nrehabilitation of large hydropower generation assets, (ii) rehabilitation of aging transmission and \ndistribution assets, (iii) improvement of cross-border interconnection of power systems, (iv) \ndevelopment of renewable energy, and (v) policy and institutional development. The project is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Armenia.15 \n \n12.  The  project  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  power  system  operation  and  reduce \ntransmission losses, which are essential to improve energy security and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions.16 Rehabilitation of existing substations will improve the reliability and quality of power \nsupply to urban and rural consumers, reduce regional disparities within Armenia, and support \ninclusive and sustainable economic development. An efficient and reliable power system will \nfacilitate the expansion of cross-border power trade in the region. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  expected  impact  will  be  improved  reliability  and  efficiency  of  power  supply  in \nArmenia. The outcome will be  increased operating efficiency of the domestic transmission \nnetwork. \n   \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The project will have three outputs: \n(i)  Expansion  of  the  Supervision  Control  and  Data  Acquisition  (SCADA) \nsystem and Energy Management System (EMS). This includes installation of \nSCADA hardware and software, communication equipment, and optical ground \nwire; improvement and upgrading of the load dispatch centers, and training on \nSCADA and the EMS. \n(ii)  Rehabilitation  of  220  kilovolt  substations  in  Agarak  2  and  Shinuhayr. \nReplacement  of  aging  power  transformers,  circuit  breakers,  instrument \ntransformers, disconnectors, and control and protection equipment with modern \ntechnology in Agarak 2 and Shinuhayr. \n                                                \n11 To meet the economic growth targets, electricity demand is expected to grow 2%\u20133% annually in 2015\u20132025. \n12  ADB. 2006.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR24,022,000 (equivalent to $37 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.18 The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n17.  The government has asked the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD) to provide $30 million in parallel to help finance the rehabilitation of two substations at \nArarat 2 and Yeghegnadzor.

MENR, the executing agency, has established a project management unit led by the \ndeputy minister. It is responsible for (i) overall project supervision; (ii) coordination of policy, \nplanning,  interagency,  and  aid  cooperation;  and  (iii)  provision  of  government  counterpart \nsupport. \n \n                                                \n20  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "6   \n \n20.  EPSO and HVEN will be the implementing agencies. EPSO will be responsible for \nimplementation of the SCADA system and EMS component, and HVEN for the substation \nrehabilitation  components.  EPSO  and  HVEN  will  each  establish  a  dedicated  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) within the existing company structure. Each PIU will comprise at least \nthree counterpart staff, supported by the project implementation consultants. The PIUs will be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation and preparation of bid evaluation reports, project \nprogress  reports,  administration  of  consulting  and  procurement  contracts,  applications  for \nwithdrawal of funds, and any other reports required by ADB. \n \n21.  Procurement of goods and works from ADB loan proceeds will be undertaken following \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and a procurement plan \ndeveloped  for  the  project.  The  procurement  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures using standard bidding documents for plants (single-stage, single-envelope). \n \n22.  EPSO and HVEN will each employ a project implementation consulting firm. The two \nfirms will provide technical, financial, and administrative support to the PIUs during project \nimplementation. Consultant recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time) and the procurement plan developed for the project. \nQuality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 will be the default method for \nrecruiting the consulting firms because of the complexity of the assignment and the application \nof modern technologies. \n \n23.  The project will be implemented from December 2014 to December 2019. The turnkey \ncontracts are expected to be awarded during the second quarter of 2015. MENR and the \nimplementation  consultants  will  prepare  a  detailed  implementation  schedule  during  the \npreconstruction phase of the project and submit it to ADB. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  Expansion and rehabilitation of the SCADA system, the EMS, and substation facilities \nthrough the installation of modern digital control and protection systems will significantly improve \nsystem reliability and security. Rehabilitation of substation facilities not only helps HVEN deliver \npower  reliably  and  safely  to  customers  but  also  reduces  transmission  losses  and  lowers \noperating costs. ADB conducted technical due diligence on the investment proposal and is \nsatisfied with the quality of the cost estimates, operating cost structures, appropriateness of the \ntechnology, and the execution plan. The readiness level is high and the technical solutions are \nassessed to be more cost-effective than the alternatives. Use of the SCADA system and EMS is \nan international standard practice for power system operators based on proven technology and \nis considered appropriate in this case. EPSO and HVEN operation and maintenance staff are \nfamiliar with the proposed design concepts. EPSO and HVEN have sufficient technical capacity \nand experienced staff to undertake project implementation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Rehabilitation of the substations and expansion of the SCADA system and EMS are \nexpected to increase the reliability of the transmission system thereby ensuring energy security. \nThe  project  adopts  a  least-cost  approach  to  resolve  the  issue  of  aging  transmission \ninfrastructure and envisaged increase in system outages and shutdowns. The project is both \nfinancially and economically viable. ", "7 \n \n26.  The incremental benefits arising from the project include the avoidance of energy-flow \ninterruption through the substations. The without-project scenario assumes that the number of \noutages and shutdowns will increase as the equipment ages and is eventually beyond repair. \nAlso, as the substations are part of the overall transmission network, a system approach takes \ninto account the potential impact of outages and/or stoppage of operation of other overused \nsystem assets on the energy flow. To value the project benefits, the current transmission tariff of \nAMD1.28/kWh and operator tariff of AMD0.23/kWh were considered, and the projected tariff \nwas estimated based on projected operation of business and servicing of existing and new \nloans for investment projects. Incremental operation and maintenance cost is assumed to be \n2% of the total capital cost. The financial internal rate of return for the substations rehabilitation \ncomponent of the project, which is to be carried out by HVEN, is estimated to be 12.8%, \nexceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 3.0%. The SCADA system and EMS upgrade \ncomponent  is  expected  to  enhance  overall  system  control  and  improve  efficiency.  A  tariff \nincrease, following the application to the regulator, is expected to cover the investment cost and \nloan repayment. An incremental recurring cost sustainability assessment found this part of the \nproject, which is to be implemented by EPSO, financially viable with a financial internal rate of \nreturn of 3.6%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 2.1%. \n \n27.  The economic analysis provides an economic internal rate of return of 18.3%, which \ncompares favorably with the benchmark rate of 12.0% for the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital. The project\u2019s assessed economic viability is based on expected streams of benefits \narising from avoided interruption of energy flow and incremental costs resulting from the project \nover 25 years. Benefits arising from the steady delivery of electricity and avoided outages were \ncalculated based on the cost of unserved energy at $0.02/kWh as a conservative measure. \nEnvironmental mitigation costs, as part of the investment costs, were considered. No additional \nland will be required as the rehabilitation and upgrading will be conducted in the existing \nsubstations and load center. \n \n28.  The sensitivity analysis supports the project economic and financial viability, and shows \nrobustness even under unfavorable circumstances. \n \nC.  Governance \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  MENR,  EPSO,  and  HVEN.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 18). \n \n30.  The financial management assessment of EPSO and HVEN assessed the institutional \nsetup  of  the  companies  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.21 It  established  that  both \ncompanies  have  adequate  financial  management  arrangements  in  place  to  process  and \nimplement the project. Both EPSO and HVEN have experience in implementing aid-financed \ninfrastructure projects22 and have undergone capacity-building programs associated with those \nprojects on project account management, financial reporting, and internal control. \n \n31.  The procurement capacity of EPSO and HVEN is assessed to be low. The inherent \nprocurement risks are high due to the contract value and technical complexity. However, this \n                                                \n21  ADB. 2005. Guidelines on Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

By increasing the supply of efficient and reliable electricity to the system, the project will \nincrease  the  reliability  of  the  power  supply  nationwide,  benefiting  the  poor  and  neglected \nregions.  Since  the  rural  poor  are  the  first  to  be  cut  off  from  supply  during  winter  power \nshortages, system loss reduction and stronger supply reliability will particularly benefit the poor \nand the socially excluded. The  project will enhance regional power trade with neighboring \ncountries, which will stimulate economic growth and increase employment opportunities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Environmental assessment. The project is categorized B for environment under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared, \nincluding two separate environmental management plans (one each for EPSO and HVEN). The \ninitial environmental examination was disclosed on 14 May 2014 as per ADB public disclosure \nrequirements.23 EPSO and HVEN have staff responsible for safety but will be assisted by and \nreceive on-the-job environmental training from the project implementation consultants. The ADB \nloan will cover the cost of implementing the environmental management plans. \n \n34.  The project\u2019s main environmental impacts would occur mainly during construction as a \nresult  of  waste  generated  during  equipment  replacement  and  construction  for  earth-wire \nreplacement. The issues will be related to (i) management of the used oil and grease wastes, \nincluding  identification  and  special  disposal  of  polychlorinated  biphenyls  containing  oils;  \n(ii) disposal of scrap metal, old batteries, and other solid wastes; (iii) occupational health and \nsafety measures at the project sites; (iv) proper handling and monitoring of sulfur hexafluoride \ncircuit breakers; and (v) limited air and noise pollution, as well as tree cutting within the rights-of-\nway.  Potential  negative  environmental  impacts  during  operation  include  sulfur  hexafluoride \nleakage and electromagnetic fields. The Environmental Management Plan specifies adequate \nmitigation measures and monitoring plans to cover these impacts. Adequate storage facilities \nwill be constructed at each substation for safe temporary storage of released oils and batteries. \nNonpolychlorinated biphenyl oils will be refined for on-site reuse by a licensed company. \n35.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  will  have  no  land  acquisition  issues,  as \nrehabilitation works will be limited to the substation. The project is therefore categorized C for \ninvoluntary resettlement under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized C for indigenous peoples. The project \nis  not  expected  to  affect  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  The project integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. The \ngovernment fully supports the project. MENR will coordinate the work of government agencies \n                                                \n23 Efforts were made to collaborate with EBRD to meet ADB\u2019s and EBRD\u2019s safeguard requirements. That includes \nsharing with EBRD the original initial environmental examination prepared to cover all proposed substations, and a \nletter exchange with EBRD explaining how ADB\u2019s and EBRD\u2019s responsibilities for safeguard preparation and \nimplementation are allocated.

EPSO  and  HVEN  have  accumulated  substantial  experience  in \nmanaging projects in cooperation with international financial institutions. However, each agency \nremains resource-constrained and its ability to manage multiple large projects is uncertain \nwithout  the  support  of  external  international  expertise.
