The Government of Georgia is endeavoring to make Georgia a regional and logistics \nhub and more attractive for businesses. The East West Highway (EWH), stretching 410 km from \nSarpi on the Black Sea, at the border with Turkey, through the center of the country to the \ncapital Tbilisi and on to the border with Azerbaijan, is the main inter-regional and international \nroute between western and eastern Georgia, as well as its neighboring countries. Representing \nabout 2 percent of Georgia's road network and one fourth of its international roads, the EWH \nserves  8,000  to  10,000  vehicles  per  day  and  carries  over  60  percent  of  the  country's \ninternational  trade.  In  anticipation  of  admission  of  Georgia  to  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) program in 2016, the EWH will be an integral part of one of the \nsix key CAREC corridors providing the shortest transit link to connect Central Asia with Europe \nand East Asia. \n \n2.  In light of the traffic growth on EWH, the high percentage of truck traffic, and the difficult \nterrain and resulting geometric profiles, capacity expansion of the current 2-lane mountainous \nsection between Chumateleti and Argveta is crucial to realizing full potential of the EWH with \nimprovements to the highway  either completed or underway on each side of this section. \nTherefore, the Government has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and several \nother development partners to finance the remaining bottleneck sections (Chumateleti\u2013Argveta) \non the EWH. A feasibility study financed under a World Bank project for the Chumateleti\u2013\nArgveta section (comprising four sections F1 through F4) of the EWH was completed in 2015.  \nThe World Bank will finance Section F1 of about 11km from Chumateleti to Khevi and detailed \ndesign for the section will start in Q4 2016. Detailed design of the approximate 42 km section, \nF2, F3, and F4 between Khevi and Argveta, financed under an ongoing ADB loan (Loan 2843-\nGEO), will commence in early 2017. The terms of reference for the detailed design consultant \ncovers the preparation of detailed design for the new construction of Khevi\u2013Ubisa\u2013Shorapani\u2013\nArgveta  section,  the  bidding  documents,  and  the  environment  impact  analysis  and  land \nacquisition and resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nrequirements.    \n \n3.  The proposed bottleneck section (Khevi\u2013Ubisa) improvement for ADB financing requires \nthe construction of around 12 tunnels, 43 bridges, and several very deep cuttings and high \nembankments within a distance of around 15 km, through terrain with difficult geological and \ngeotechnical conditions. While the detailed design consultant will have been selected on the \nbasis of its experience with designing roadwork in such conditions, the scope for design errors \nis large, and the outcome of such errors would be potentially very serious. Accordingly, and is \noften  the  case  on  large  and  complex  infrastructure  projects,  an  independent  proof  check \nconsultant is to be engaged to review the detailed design consultant\u2019s major outputs for, for \nexample, tunnels, bridges, and deep cuttings, to provide the government with advice on the \nsoundness of the designs, and with suggestions for improving them. In addition, critical sections \nof  Georgia\u2019s  international  and  secondary  road  network  are  being  rapidly  improved,  with \ndevelopment partner assistance and also through the Government\u2019s own resources. These \nimprovements, while essential, are not being matched by an improvement in the country\u2019s ability \nto operate and maintain the network in a sustainable manner over the medium to long term. \nThis requires both a sound understanding of the sector, and knowledge of what the Government \nand other development partners are doing and proposing to do. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  9 \n4.  To help formulate the project design mutually agreed and suitable for ADB financing, the \nproject preparatory  technical assistance (PPTA) will support the Road Department (RD) under \nthe  Ministry  of  Regional  Development  and  Infrastructure  with  (i)  providing  an  independent \ntechnical review, covering technical and contractual aspects, of the detailed design for the \nhighway improvement works; and (ii) providing a comprehensive assessment of the country\u2019s \nroad  sector  from  institutional,  operational,  financial,  and  technical  perspectives  and \nrecommending ensuing institution and capacity development activities for enhancing Georgia\u2019s \nexisting road asset management system and road safety.  \n \nB.
