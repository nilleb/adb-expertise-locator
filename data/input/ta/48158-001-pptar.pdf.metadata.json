There is an urgent need to support the government in the development of the urban \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  sector  in  Cambodia  and  to  identify  appropriate  projects  and \nimplementation options with them, including potential engagement with the private sector. The \ngovernment has identified a number of priority towns to be covered under the ensuing project \nloan. A project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is required to review the available studies \nand designs, prepare additional studies and designs, prepare a master plan and roadmap, and \ndevelop  a  project  suitable  for  ADB  funding  in  terms  of  technical,  financial,  economic, \ninstitutional, sector policy, legal, social, poverty, gender and safeguard contexts, in conjunction \nwith  the  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  operational  experience,  and  lessons  from \nevaluations of previous projects. \n \n2.  The Project will contribute to the Government\u2019s target for 100% urban water supply \ncoverage by 2025 and align with proposed government targets for urban sanitation. The Project \nwill expand water supply and sanitation coverage in selected towns1, including (i) increased \naccess to 24-hour supply and improving water quality, to meet Cambodia\u2019s national drinking \nwater standards, in at least four towns from Battambang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Svay \nRieng provinces, which have been identified as being most in need by the MIH to meet demand \nin these rapidly expanding towns; (ii) rehabilitation/expansion of urban sanitation services, under \nthe MPWT, will focus on the provision of septage management services and/or sewerage \nsystem development for Battambang, Pursat, Svay Rieng, and Sihanoukville, to complement \nthe expansion of the water supply systems and ongoing/planned ADB urban development \nprojects2; (iii) TA to pave the way for further investment to improve services in other provincial \nand sub-provincial towns, which is an increasing area of concern for the Government; (iv) \ncapacity development to assist the MIH to improve water utility performance, service provision, \nand tariff setting by replicating similar initiatives that made Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority \n(PPWSA) successful,3 including on-the-job training for staff; and (v) capacity development to \nassist  the  MPWT  to  establish  septage  management  services,  improve  existing  sewerage \nservices, and improve financial sustainability. In addition, the Project will provide opportunities \nfor the two ministries to collaborate more closely and pilot initiatives, such as sanitation tariffs \nbeing included in the water billing. The project interventions will build on lessons from previous \nADB projects.4 \n \n   \n                                                \n1  Additional Appendix 5 contains a full list of towns for consideration during the PPTA, which will be prioritized based \non the available budget.  \n2  Loan 2983-CAM GMS Southern Economic Corridor Towns Development Project approved in December 2012; the \nproposed loan for the Integrated Urban Environmental Management in the Tonle Sap Basin Project, for approval in \n2015; and the proposed Loan for the Second GMS Corridor Towns Development Project, for approval in 2016. \n3  The factors that have contributed to PPWSA\u2019s success included (i) strong and continuous leadership, (ii) financial \nautonomy, (iii) continuous staff development and performance-based bonuses, (iv) customer-orientated service, (v) \nhigh-quality infrastructure and equipment, and (vi) a strong focus on NRW reduction and energy efficiency. \n4  ADB Provincial Towns Improvement Project (loans 1725-CAM and 2013-CAM). Among lessons learned are the \nneed to (i) promote high quality design for water treatment plants to allow flexible operation, (ii) procure good-\nquality equipment, and (iii) select equipment that can be easily repaired or replaced. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n3.  The TA will be structured into two activities (i) technical pre-feasibility studies, cost \nestimates, and preliminary engineering designs for priority projects will be prepared by the Cities \nDevelopment Initiative for Asia (CDIA)5 and (ii) project preparation and safeguards will be \nprepared by ADB\u2019s TA consultants. To provide more advanced studies and designs to be \ndeveloped ready for project preparation and safeguards assessments, preparation of activity (i) \nwill precede that of (ii). The CDIA Consultants will maintain close coordination and collaboration \nwith the TA Consultants to ensure that financial and economic analyses are consistent with the \nproject  components  and  the  outputs  of  the  safeguards  assessments  are  included  in  the \nproposed design of each component. \n \n4.  The CDIA activities are not covered by the TA but are planned to include (i) conduct \nrapid assessments for nine towns to confirm the final towns selected for the Project; (ii) review \nand assist in the update of long and medium term development plans for the sector; (iii) prepare \na 20-year roadmap for increasing urban water supply and sanitation coverage; (iv) undertake \ntechnical feasibility studies and assist the EA to evaluate and prioritize subproject towns; (v) \nprepare cost estimates, (vi) prepare preliminary engineering designs for priority subprojects and \nsample bidding documents, (vii) prepare a procurement capacity assessment for the executing \nand implementing agencies; and (viii) detailed implementation and procurement arrangements. \nThe preliminary list of project towns for rapid assessment and proposed focus is included Table \nA3.1. \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Consulting Services Requirement \nTown  Water Supply  Sanitation \nBattambang  Yes  Yes \nPursat  Yes  Yes \nSvay Rieng  Yes  Yes \nStueng Saen (Kampong Thom Province)  Yes  Yes \nStoung (Kampong Thom Province)  Yes  No \nTaing Krasang (Kampong Thom Province)  Yes  No \nMondul Kiri  Yes  No \nSerei Saophoan (Banteay Meanchey Province)  No  Yes \nSihanoukville  No  Yes \nSource: Asian Development Bank     \n \n5.

The Initiative provides assistance to medium-sized Asian cities to bridge the gap between their \ndevelopment plans and the implementation of their infrastructure investments. CDIA uses a demand driven \napproach to support the identification and development of urban investment projects in the framework of existing \ncity development plans that emphasize environmental sustainability, pro-poor development, good governance, and \nclimate  change  mitigation/adaptation.  To  facilitate  these  initiatives  at  city  level,  CDIA  provides  a  range  of \ninternational and domestic expertise to cities that can include support for the preparation of pre-feasibility studies \nfor high priority infrastructure investment projects as one of several elements. \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n \nto implement monitor safeguards; and (iv) prepare a program for institutional development and \ncapacity building.
