In the proposed project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a $30 million \nsovereign loan to Mongolia to support the improvement of livestock production systems in 20 \nsoums (districts) of four aimags (provinces) in Central Mongolia. The project will promote pasture \nrehabilitation and carbon sequestration while increasing the incomes of herder households \nthrough  the  formation  and  institutionalization  of  pasture  user  groups  and  establishment  of \nrangeland user agreements to promote reduced livestock numbers and increased quality and \nquantity of outputs. The project will also support the formation of private entities to improve the \nentire livestock value chain, and will undertake capacity building of the government institutions \ninvolved in livestock production so that they are better able to assist the sector. \n \n2.  The proposed project\u2019s impact will be the competitiveness and sustainability of Mongolia\u2019s \nlivestock sector improved (Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030).1 The project will \nhave the following outcome: efficiency and sustainability of climate-resilient livestock production \nincreased.2  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  In support of the sovereign loan, the proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will \nprovide capacity building to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry (MOFALI), \nparticularly  at  the  local  level,  including  through  training,  awareness  raising,  and  technical \nguidelines. The TA will support the establishment of functioning livestock management and animal \nhealth information systems, and a food safety and traceability system along the value chain from \nherders to meat markets. \n \n4.  The sovereign loan will finance investments in facilities and equipment to improve the \nclimate resilience of livestock, pasture, and water management; and improve livestock value \nchains. The TA will provide knowledge and enhance skills in the Government of Mongolia. These \nactivities cannot be performed under the sovereign loan because of the difficulty to structure on \na cost-recovery basis. This TA is listed in the current country operations business plan.3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  TA will support output 3 of the proposed project and include training, awareness raising, \nand preparation of technical guidelines, as well as the establishment of livestock management \nand animal health information systems at the local level. \n \n6.  Output 3: Livestock sector regulatory framework and capacity enhanced. The TA will \nsupport the government by:  \n \n(i)  Establishing a pilot livestock management information system (LMIS) in the project \naimags and soums, and organizing workshops and meetings at the national and \naimag levels to inform systems development and roll out use of the LMIS. The \ngeographic information system-based LMIS will include (a) quantitative, qualitative, \n \n1  Government of Mongolia. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030. Ulaanbaatar. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 March 2021. \n ", "2 \nand spatial information related to livestock production, pastureland use, pasture \nreserve land, water points, animal shelters, and herder communities; and (b) \ngeographic  data  on  the  establishment  and  operation  of  herder  groups  and \nrangeland  use  agreements,  other relevant  herder communities,  water points, \npasture  reserve  areas,  and  livestock  and  fiber  outputs.  Data  will  be  initially \ncollected on a pilot basis for the project area. The system will be linked to data and \ninformation on rangeland monitoring and ecological recovery collected at 1,550 \npoints of the National Agency for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring \nthrough  a  line  point  method;  and  at  4,000  points  of  the  Agency  for  Land \nManagement and Administration, Geodesy, and Cartography through a photo-\nmonitoring methodology. The system will integrate data on livestock from the \nNational  Statistical  Office,  enable  analysis  of  an  integrated  pasture  use \nmanagement  system,  and  support  the  implementation  of  subprograms.  The \nsystem will create pastureland use and cadastral maps by region, aimag, and \nsoum; determine the number and types of livestock that can be supported in the \narea in a sustainable manner; and create a database to incorporate all information. \nThe system will generate information that can be used to develop targets, monitor \nprogress, and report on livestock productivity and livestock-carrying capacities \nconsistent  with  sustainable  systems  and  natural  resource  conservation.  The \nsystem will provide information that can contribute to the estimation of greenhouse \ngas emissions from livestock and of soil carbon capture. \n \n(ii)  Establishing a system of carcass quality, traceability, and feedback to suppliers, \nincluding animal identification systems and animal health compliance. This will \nenable suppliers and processors to comply with market requirements. The TA will \nsupport a series of stakeholder workshops and meetings at national and aimag \nlevels to inform systems development as well as rollout and use of the system. It \nwill  support  consultants  in  developing  (a)  carcass  quality,  traceability,  and \nfeedback  systems;  (b)  livestock  identification  systems;  and  (c)  animal  health \nsystems. It will also enable them to conduct a field study of currently operating \nsupplier\u2013processor linkages to inform the systems development process.  \n \n(iii)  Strengthening the capacity of the General Authority of Veterinary Services to trace \nlivestock  and  livestock  products  through  the  establishment  of  the  Mongolian \nAnimal Health Information System (MAHIS) in the project area. The MAHIS will \nimprove the quality of local veterinary services to meet food safety standards. The \nMAHIS integrates several subsystems to assure animal health, quality and hygiene \nof  products,  and  traceability.  Establishment  of  the  MAHIS  also  involves  the \nenrolment of processors in the system. This activity supports the rollout and use \nof the MAHIS in the project areas, as well as training sessions and meetings to \nsupport the use of the system in the field. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n8.  The following are ineligible items under the JFPR: (i) purchase of vehicles, (ii) salaries for \ncivil servants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering \n ", "3 \ndesign, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible \nItems (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.4 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will delegate administration of the TA to the MOFALI, which will be the executing \nagency. The MOFALI will select consultants, procure goods and services, sign and administer \ncontracts  (including  payments),  manage  consultants  and  suppliers,  and  prepare  the  TA \ncompletion report. Consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration and/or staff \ninstructions.5 The consulting firms will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection, with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 and using a simplified technical proposal. The executing agency has \nconfirmed that it will not extend the same privileges and immunities granted to consultants under \nnon-delegated TA operations to consultants performing missions under delegated TA operations. \nThe  consulting  service  recruitment  notice  and  request  for  proposals  will  indicate  (i)  the \ninapplicability of ADB\u2019s privileges and immunities, and (ii) the requirement for consultants to pay \ntaxes and duties on the amount paid under their consulting services contract.

ADB will disburse funds \nto the executing agency through advance fund and statement of expenditures procedures, in line \nwith the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nThe executing agency is required to keep a separate account for the TA project and to submit \nannual audited project financial statements. The executing agency should submit the annual \naudited project financial statement to ADB within 6 months from the end of their fiscal year, for \nreview  and  necessary  action.  ADB  has  conducted  the  necessary  due  diligence,  including \nprocurement and financial management capacity assessments, and confirmed that the executing \nagency has the necessary capacity to administer the TA. The assessments have been guided by \nthe due diligence for the Climate-Resilient Livestock Sector Development Project, which will be \nimplemented by the same executing agency. The results of the assessments as well as detailed \ndisbursement and financial reporting and auditing arrangements are provided in the project \nadministration manual.6 The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table.  \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  July 2021\u2013June 2024 \nOversight body  A  multisector  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  MOFALI  State \nSecretary,  including  the  Director  General  of  Livestock  Policy \nImplementation  Coordination  Department  as  deputy  chair  and \nrepresentatives from other central agencies and participating aimags \nand  professional  associations,  will  provide  guidance  to  the  loan \nproject and the transaction TA.
