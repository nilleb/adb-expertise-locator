INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2009 country programming mission for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nthe government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide capacity development \ntechnical assistance (TA) for capacity building for information and communication technology \n(ICT)-based  industrial  waste  management.  The  TA  will  help  the  government  enhance  its \ninstitutional capacity for industrial waste management, and improve its management information \nsystem and monitoring mechanisms using information technology. The TA is consistent with the \nfocus of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2008\u20132010 for the PRC;1 and ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020,2 which supports environmental protection and capacity development to reinforce inclusive \ngrowth. ADB fielded a TA fact-finding mission during 24\u201327 July 2010 to prepare the TA report.3 \nThe mission and the government reached an agreement4 on the project impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsulting services. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Aside from water and air pollution control, industrial waste management, particularly \nhazardous waste management, has become an emerging challenge in the PRC. Without proper \nmanagement of industrial waste, it could undermine the PRC\u2019s achievements of decades of \neconomic growth, and affect people\u2019s health and welfare, and environmental quality. \n \n3.  The  government  conducted  its  first  national  inventory  of  pollutants  in  2008,  which \nincluded basic environmental data of industries, and a database of key pollution sources for all \nsectors. The inventory covered industrial, agricultural, and urban pollution sources. In 2009, the \nvolume of industrial waste was about 2.04 billion tons\u2014an increase of 7.3% from that of 2008, \nof  which  about  1.38  billion  tons  of  the  waste  was  recycled  and  reused.  The  amount  of \nhazardous waste in 2009 was about 14.3 million tons, of which 8.31 million tons was reused.5 \nThe balance of the waste was either stored or disposed of. There is an increasing trend of trans-\nboundary transfer and disposal of industrial waste, particularly of hazardous waste, between \ncounties and regions in the country. There has been no investigation or survey to assess the \nquality of the storage sites and disposal facilities because of the lack of a monitoring and \nreporting system, which casts doubt on the appropriateness of the waste storage and disposal \nfacilities, and possibly, secondary contamination of the environment. \n \n4.  The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) is responsible for establishing policies \nand regulations on industrial waste management, and monitoring enforcement of the regulations \nby provincial and municipal governments. The government prepared a national project in 2008 \nto construct solid waste management centers at the MEP and in 31 provinces, and a national \ninformation system  on solid  waste  management.  The  national  information  system  is  being \ndeveloped  following  a  feasibility  study  conducted  in  2004  that  comprises  six  subsystems: \n(i) source management, (ii) permit approval and management, (iii) waste transfer management, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Once the system is developed, an enterprise will have access to the system in each \ncounty and input data online. A local environmental protection bureau (EPB) will be responsible \nfor verifying the enterprise\u2019s information before endorsing the data to the information center at a \nprovincial  EPB.  The  provincial  EPB  will  be  able  to  verify  the  county-level  information  by \ncompiling the data and calculating the waste volume of each category of waste in the province. \nThe MEP information center will be able to use the system to conduct inquiries, compile data, \nand analyze statistics for industrial waste management.    \n \n5.  The  MEP  faced  several  major  challenges  during  the  establishment  of  the  national \ninformation system, including (i) the availability of qualified staff to supervise and administer \nindustrial waste management; (ii) an ineffective manifest system for monitoring the generation, \ntransportation, and final disposal of industrial waste as a result of the lengthy paperwork and \ndifficulty in keeping track of records;6 (iii) weak institutional capacity for contingency planning \nand  emergency  responses  to  control  and  contain  accidents  caused  by  mishandling  of \nhazardous waste; and (iv) an outdated information system that does not meet the current and \nmedium-term  needs  for  industrial  waste  management.  For  example,  the  management  of \nelectronics waste, which has been regulated since 2009, is not in the system. The framework of \nthe information system needs to be updated to include industrial waste that is being regulated. \nMEP staff also needs to be trained in the system development and to have their system \nmanagement skills enhanced. \n \n6.  The  government  requested  ADB  to  provide  TA  to  help  the  MEP  to  (i) review  the \nframework of its national information system, and make recommendations for its improvement \nand expansion to meet the needs for industrial waste management for the following 5\u201310 years; \n(ii) improve the institutional capacity for industrial waste management, including management of \nthe  information  system,  data  collection  and  analysis,  information  sharing  and  uses,  and \nreporting; and (iii) prepare guidelines on the establishment and management of the industrial \nwaste management information system.  \n \n7.  ADB provided TA in 2005 to help develop MEP (then the State Environmental Protection \nAgency) regional supervision centers; and in 2009, additional TA on Strengthening Enforcement \nof  Environmental  Laws  and  Regulations  to  improve  the  enforcement  capacity  of  national, \nregional, and local environmental agencies.7 ADB has also been assisting the government\u2019s \nmunicipal waste management investment.8 In October 2009, ADB provided regional TA to \nimprove public services through ICT in three ADB developing member countries.9 The review of \nICT project experiences in several countries shows the urgency of enhancing governments\u2019 \ncapacity of using ICT in a coordinated and organized manner. A range of activities will need to \nbe considered, including a sector-specific ICT road map, and ICT project management in each \nsector. The TA will build on the achievements of the ADB projects, and draw lessons from these \n                                                 \n6  To improve the efficiency of the manifest system, the MEP is considering the establishment of an electronic system \nthat will enhance the accuracy of data entry and better monitoring of waste flows from generation to final disposal. \n7  ADB. 2005.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The expected impact of the TA will be improved industrial waste management in major \nindustrial provinces. It is expected that the TA will support the MEP in meeting its targets and \ngoals of using information technology to establish databases and management frameworks for \nenvironmental protection as portrayed in the government\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u2013\n2010; and of improving hazardous waste management in the upcoming Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2011\u20132015. The outcome of the TA will be strengthened capacity for the development and \nmaintenance of the industrial waste management information system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will (i) review the current national framework of the industrial waste management \ninformation  system,  (ii)  assess  its  comprehensiveness  in  meeting  the  needs  of  existing \nregulatory requirements, (iii) improve the institutional capacity for managing the system, and \n(iv) make recommendations for strengthening the institutional capacity and improvement of the \ninformation system. The TA will also conduct consultation meetings with the executing agency, \nand  municipal  and  provincial  EPBs;  and  carry  out  a  needs  assessment  to  prepare  an \ninstitutional capacity development plan and conduct related training. The TA will support the \nestablishment of the national industrial waste management information system at the MEP, and \nmunicipal and provincial governments; and develop institutional capacity for managing and \nmaintaining the information system. Key activities for achieving TA outputs are described below. \n \n10.  Output  1:  Framework  of  the  industrial waste  management  information  system \nupdated. The TA consultants will (i) review the framework of the information system that is \nbeing developed by the MEP; (ii) assess the appropriateness of the framework design based on \ninternational practices; and the needs of regulatory enforcement in the following 5\u201310 years, \nparticularly the institutional structure required for the industrial waste management information \nsystem; and the needs for an information system for electronics waste, and an emergency \nresponse system; and (iii) assess the institutional capacity of the MEP and two municipal EPBs \nfor applying e-governance in industrial waste management. The e-government capacity maturity \nmodel being developed under ADB TA (footnote 9) can be considered an assessment tool for \nthis purpose. The consultants will prepare a report on the performance of the existing system \nand make recommendations on the improvement and expansion of the system as needed. \n \n11.  Output 2: Training for the development and maintenance of the industrial waste \nmanagement  information  system  conducted. Three domestic training workshops will be \norganized to enhance institutional capacity for industrial waste information management and \noperation. One workshop will focus on the development of information system-based industrial \nwaste management policies and strategies, and improvement of the institutional capacity for \nusing an information system for waste management. The second workshop will be on-the-job \ntraining, and will focus on the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the information system, and \ndata management. The third workshop will provide a \u201ctraining the trainers\u201d program to selected \nofficers, who will be able to train municipal and provincial EPB staff and the private sector on the \nuse  of  the  information  system  after  the  TA  completion.  Each  workshop  will  train  about \n40 participants from the MEP, and municipal and provincial EPBs. \n ", "4   \n12.  The TA will also support an international training tour to learn from the experiences of an \nADB developing member country  about the design, O&M of industrial waste management \ninformation system, and the use of the system to support industrial waste management and \npolicy development. Participants of the training tour will be selected from officials who have \nbeen involved in the (i) preparation of the feasibility study of the industrial waste management \ninformation  system,  (ii)  TA  implementation,  and/or  (iii)  operation  and  management  of  the \ninformation system. The participants will prepare a report on the lessons learned from the \ntraining tour, and share their experience during the domestic training workshops. \n     \n13.  Output 3: Management of the industrial waste management information system \ndemonstrated. The TA will select two municipal EPBs to (i) demonstrate the management and \nmaintenance of an industrial waste management information system, (ii) test management \nguidelines, and (iii) showcase the improved industrial waste management information system. \nThe executing agency will select the demonstration bureaus based on their institutional capacity \nfor  information  management  and  willingness  to  participate  in  the  demonstration  program. \nPriorities will be given to industrialized cities, such as Dalian, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Shanghai, \nor Xi\u2019an. \n \n14.  Output 4: Guidelines on the development and management of the industrial waste \nmanagement  information  system  prepared.  Based  on  the  assessment  of  the  existing \nindustrial waste management information system and the needs for future improvement, the TA \nconsultants will prepare guidelines on the development and management of the industrial waste \nmanagement information system, which will be turned into a knowledge product at the end of \nthe  TA  implementation.  The  draft  guidelines  will  be  pilot  tested  in  the  two  selected \ndemonstration bureaus and presented in an international workshop, and will be revised and \nfinalized  after  receiving  feedback  from  the  demonstration  and  the  international  workshop. \nInternational  speakers  and  local  officers  in  charge  of  industrial  waste  management  in \ngovernment  agencies  in  selected  ADB  member  countries  will  be  invited  to  share  their \nexperiences in industrial waste management. The MEP will (i) present the TA results in an \ninternational workshop, and (ii) share experiences with participants on the development and \nmanagement of the industrial waste management information system. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA cost is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which $450,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013other  sources).  The \ngovernment will finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions, which \nwill include (i) counterpart staff time, remuneration, and travel expenses; (ii) logistic support in \narranging workshops and conferences; and (iii) a fully functional office space for consultants, \nwith free water and utility supply, and free access to internet and photocopying. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The MEP will be the executing agency, and the Environmental Development Center \n(EDC) will be the implementing agency. The TA will be partially delegated to the EDC following \nthe enhanced partnership model of the memorandum of understanding between ADB and the \ngovernment on the \u201cEnhanced Partnership on Technical Assistance Delegation to the Executing \nAgency\u201d of 30 November 2009. The EDC will be responsible for developing more detailed terms \nof reference for consulting services, selection and recruitment of consultants, and supervision of \nthe TA activities. ADB will sign the consultant contracts and administer the TA. The TA is the \n ", "  5\nsecond partially delegated TA to the MEP. The procurement capacity of the MEP was first \nassessed  in  2008,  and  revalidated  during  the  TA  fact-finding  mission  in  July  2010.  The \nassessment concluded that the executing and implementing agencies have sufficient resources, \nand satisfactory procurement and oversight procedures to implement the TA. The detailed \ncapacity assessment report is available upon request.   \n \n17.  The MEP will establish a TA steering committee, chaired by a director general in charge \nof  environmental  information  or  pollution  control;  and  comprising  representatives  from \nconcerned departments from the EDC and MEP. The steering committee will provide overall \nguidance for TA implementation and endorse TA outputs. A TA management office will be set \nup in the International Cooperation Division of the EDC, which will be responsible for day-to-day \noperational matters of the TA, including supervising the TA consultants\u2019 work plan, reviewing \ntheir  outputs,  and  coordinating  with  provincial  EPBs  on  the  preparation  of  the  training \nworkshops and demonstration program. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, tentatively scheduled from December 2010 \nto  March  2012.  A  team  of  three  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  conduct  the \nassessment, study, and training. Because of the TA budget constraints, the engagement of \nindividual  consultants  is  more  cost-effective  and  faster  to  mobilize.  It  is  estimated  that \n25 person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  an  international  expert  for  5  person-\nmonths and two national experts for 20 person-months, will be required. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The expertise of the consultants includes industrial \nwaste management, information system management, and information technology development. \nResource persons may be recruited to conduct the training. The recruitment of consultants and \nresource persons will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The EDC will also procure equipment financed by the TA following ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The equipment procured under the TA will be turned \nover to the executing agency and the two municipal EPBs after the TA completion. \n \n19.  The outcome and outputs of the TA will be presented during domestic and international \nworkshops, and posted on the ADB and MEP websites. The TA will also produce a knowledge \nproduct based on the guidelines on the development and management of the industrial waste \nmanagement information system that will be produced by the TA consultants  \n \nIV.
