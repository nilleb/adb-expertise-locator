I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $176,700,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $27,900,000; and (ii) a B loan of up to \n$148,800,000 to Phu Yen TTP Joint Stock Company (Phu Yen JSC) for the B.Grimm Viet Nam \nSolar Power Project (Phu Yen Project) in Viet Nam. The report also describes the proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $9,300,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private \nInfrastructure Fund (LEAP)1. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the LEAP loan. \n \n2.  The loan will support Phu Yen JSC to operate a 257-megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic \npower plant and its associated facilities in Phu Yen Province, Viet Nam. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) financing will meet the borrower\u2019s requirements for longer-tenor United States (US) \ndollar-denominated project financing, which local financial institutions are unable to provide. The \nfinancing will also catalyze commercial cofinancing for one of the largest scale solar power \nprojects in Southeast Asia. In addition, ADB\u2019s participation in the project will ensure compliance \nwith rigorous environmental and social safeguard standards, and will enable gender design \nfeatures and targets to be incorporated. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n3.  Project identification. High rates of economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization \nare leading to growing electricity demand in Viet Nam, which has become the second-largest \npower market in Southeast Asia (after Indonesia). Access to electricity, which was less than 10% \nof the population in 1986, is now nearly universal (99.5% in 2019). Electricity demand has grown \nrapidly, averaging 12.0% per year from 2005 to 2018, and is projected to grow at more than 8.0% \nper year through 2030. However, meeting fast-growing electricity demand and sustaining high \nrates of economic growth will be a significant challenge for Viet Nam. According to the Revised \nNational Power Development Master Plan, 2011\u20132020 (PDP VII), Viet Nam needs to invest about \n$148 billion in power transmission and generation infrastructure from 2016 to 2030.2 Because of \nfinancial  constraints  on  the  state  utility  Vietnam  Electricity  (EVN)  and  limits  on  sovereign \nborrowing, private sector investment will be essential to avoid future power shortages. \n  \n4.  In 2018, large hydropower, coal, and gas projects comprised nearly 90% of Viet Nam\u2019s \n54.9 gigawatts (GW) of installed power capacity. With limited potential remaining to develop large-\nscale hydropower plants, depleting domestic coal reserves, and growing public concern over \nenvironmental issues, renewable energy development is receiving greater focus. Viet Nam\u2019s PDP \nVII seeks to increase the share of renewable energy as a percentage of total forecast installed \ncapacity to 21% (27 GW) by 2030 and to reduce the use of imported coal-fired electricity. To meet \nthis target, installed solar power capacity is expected to increase to 12 GW by 2030.  \n \n5.  In  April  2017,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  issued  a  decision  to  accelerate  the \ndevelopment of private sector solar projects. This decision included a provision for a 20-year feed-\nin tariff (FIT) of $0.0935 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for utility-scale solar power projects. Although the \nnew FIT policy sparked significant private sector interest, project developers and financiers faced \ntwo  major  challenges.  First,  developers  wishing  to  receive  the  FIT  were  required  to  be \n \n1   Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  Vietnam Electricity. 2016. Revised National Power Development Master Plan 2011\u20132020. Ha Noi. ", "2 \ncommissioned by the end of June 2019\u2014a compressed development and construction time \nframe. Second, they were required to use the standard power purchase agreement (PPA) issued \nby the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which is not considered bankable for international lenders \non a nonrecourse project finance basis due to its lack of sufficient protection for curtailment, \nchanges in law, and various termination scenarios. As a result, developers were unable to obtain \nlong-term project financing under these conditions. \n \n6.  Consequently,  developers  decided  to  proceed  with  project  construction  using  a \ncombination of sponsor equity, short-term supplier credit, or corporate loans with short tenors and \nin local currency (dong). This was considered an interim arrangement for many developers, and \nexperienced  international  developers  such  as  B.Grimm  Power  Public  Company  Limited \n(B.Grimm) continued their efforts to structure more sustainable long-term financing solutions. \n \n7.  By June 2019, 82 solar power plants, with a total capacity of nearly 4.5 GW, were \ncommissioned and connected to the national grid, taking the share of solar power in the country\u2019s \npower mix from less than 0.5% to almost 10.0% in just a few months. This exceeds the target of \n850 MW of solar power by 2020 and 4,000 MW by 2025 set out in PDP VII, but is still below the \n2030 target of 12 GW. However, while the rapid development of solar power capacity is a great \nsuccess in terms of renewable energy development, the need for sustainable financing solutions \nremains of paramount importance to support the sector\u2019s long-term viability and stability. Further, \nrapid development has resulted in network congestion in some areas, and certain projects have \ncurtailment issues because of grid capacity constraints. \n \n8.  Since 2018, ADB has engaged in discussions with project developers to explore options \nfor financing solutions. Establishing a viable long-term financing structure is critical to support the \nsustainable development of Viet Nam\u2019s renewable energy sector. The ADB approach has been \nto (i) selectively support high-quality landmark projects developed by reputable sponsors, and    \n(ii) take the lead in developing a bankable structure to help catalyze commercial bank cofinancing \nto Viet Nam\u2019s renewable energy sector by reducing the market perception that long-term financing \nis not feasible. In late 2018, B.Grimm approached ADB to discuss its development pipeline in Viet \nNam and potential financing structures.3 The projects were considered suitable because of their \nsize and strategic location,4 and B.Grimm\u2019s strong technical capacity and record as a developer. \n  \n9.  In response to market conditions and sponsor demand, ADB has developed an innovative \nproject finance solution with tailor-made sponsor support to address the key risks in Viet Nam\u2019s \nstandard PPA. ADB\u2019s involvement in this project will showcase one of the first international \nlimited-recourse financings for one of the biggest solar power projects in the country (and in \nSoutheast Asia). Through its B loan, ADB will also mobilize one of the largest commercial \ncofinancings for a renewable energy project to date in Viet Nam. ADB has led the deal structuring \nand will ensure compliance with rigorous environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \n10.  Project design. The project consists of the development and operation of a 257 MW solar \nphotovoltaic  power  plant  and  its  associated  facilities  in  Phu  Yen  Province.  The  project  is \nconnected to the national grid and has entered into a 20-year PPA with EVN. It will directly serve \nthe electricity demand of Quang Ngai and Nha Trang city and surrounding areas\u2014a region \nemerging as one of Viet Nam\u2019s key tourist centers where power shortages are likely because of \n \n3  The proposed Phu Yen Project is one of two solar projects led by B.Grimm that ADB is considering financing in \nViet Nam in 2020. The other project, the B.Grimm Viet Nam Solar Project \u2013 Dau Tieng Project, is expected to  be \nprocessed during the second quarter of 2020 and is located in a different province with a different local partner. \n4  The Phu Yen Project is located close to the 220 MW Song Ba Ha hydropower plant which has high complementarity \nwith the project during dry seasons.  ", "3 \nrapidly growing demand. The project achieved commercial operation in June 2019, and its \noperation to date has been on track and without any curtailment.  \n \n11.  Borrower and sponsors. The borrower, Phu Yen JSC, was established in 2016 to \ndevelop and operate the project. B.Grimm owns 80% of the borrower while Truong Thanh Viet \nNam Group Joint Stock Company (TTVN) owns the remaining 20%. \n \n12.  B.Grimm, established in 1993, is one of the largest private power generation companies \namong Thailand\u2019s small power producer operators. As of November 2019, B.Grimm had total \ngenerating capacity of 2.9 GW from a diversified portfolio including 17 gas-fired co-generation \nplants, 24 solar power plants, and three hydropower plants. As of November 2019, the company \nhad 19 power projects under construction and development, which will raise its total generating \nportfolio to 3,424 MW by 2025. B.Grimm has also established climate targets to increase the \nshare of renewable energy as a percentage of installed capacity in its portfolio from 8% in 2017 \nto 30% in 2022. B.Grimm is one of ADB\u2019s largest private sector clients in Thailand; ADB owns \n4.7% shares and, with ADB assistance, it issued Thailand\u2019s first certified climate bond in 2019.5 \n \n13.  TTVN is a Vietnamese company established in 2012 that is primarily active in real estate \ndevelopment,  with  investments  in  luxury  resorts,  commercial  property,  and  social  housing \nprojects.

Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs  \n15.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) the proportion of power \nproduced from renewable energy sources in the power generation mix in Viet Nam increased by \n2020 (footnote 2), and (ii) emission intensity per unit of gross domestic product reduced.7 \n \n16.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: renewable power sustainably \ndelivered to the domestic grid increased.8 It will generate 320 gigawatt-hours of electricity from \nsolar energy per year and avoid the emission of 123,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2020. \nIt will provide at least 15 technical and 200 part-time jobs during the operation phase, and three \ntechnical or supervisory jobs for women by 2025. \n  \n17.  Outputs. The outputs of the project are that (i) 257 MW solar photovoltaic power project \nand its associated facilities are operational, (ii) gender-responsive human resources policy and \npractices are established, and (iii) employment opportunities for women are increased.  \n  \n \n5  To date, ADB has approved funding for three B.Grimm transactions: (i) an equity investment of $55 million, signed \nin June 2017; (ii) a concessional corporate loan of $20 million, funded through the ADB-administered Canadian \nClimate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia, signed in June 2017; and (iii) corporate green bonds of B5 billion or \n$157 million equivalent, signed in December 2018. \n6  ADB. 2003.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  which  outlines  seven  operational  priorities  to  address  development \nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific.9 It supports two of those priorities: (i) tackling climate change, \nbuilding  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  and \n(ii) addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequality.  It  also  supports  Strategy  2030\u2019s \nobjectives to expand the role of private sector operations and mobilize additional resources on \ntop of ADB\u2019s own financing. \n \n19.  ADB has long-standing, strong, and successful cooperation with Viet Nam. The project is \naligned with two of the three pillars of the country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020: \n(i)  increasing  the  inclusiveness  of  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  and  (ii)  improving \nenvironmental sustainability and climate change response.10 The project is also aligned with \nViet Nam\u2019s commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \ntargeting a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 8%\u201325% by 2030 (footnote 7). \n \n20.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments in energy \nefficiency and renewable energy projects.11 It will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of $6 billion in annual \nfinancing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020. Consistent with a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, \nthe project benefitted from close cross-departmental coordination with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia \nDepartment in assessing and analyzing Viet Nam\u2019s energy sector. \n \n21.  Lessons from previous operations. The project builds on results and lessons from the \nclose cooperation between ADB sovereign operations and the government for energy sector \nreform;12 and follows ADB\u2019s approval of the Gulf Solar Power Project in Viet Nam, sponsored by \nGulf  Energy  Development  Public  Company  Limited. 13  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED.  \n \n \nD.

", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The project is being implemented under Prime Minister Decision No. 11/2017/QD-\nTTg, which establishes the framework and the standards for implementing solar \npower projects. \nManagement  The main project sponsor, B.Grimm, has extensive experience in the development, \noperation, and maintenance of power projects. \nImplementation period  To meet the June 2019 deadline for the commercial operation date under the PPA, the \nproject was initially financed with sponsors\u2019 equity and short-term vendor financing.  \nConstruction arrangements  The EPC contract for the photovoltaic plant was procured via a competitive bid \nprocess. China Energy, was selected as the contractor.  \nFor the project\u2019s 220-kilovolt substation and 12.2-kilometer transmission line, the EPC \nservices are provided by the ACIT-TEG Consortium.  \nThe EPC contracts are standard fixed-price, date-certain turnkey contracts. \nThe photovoltaic panels were manufactured by JA Solar and Trina Solar. \nRevenue structure  The borrower will sell electricity generated by the project to EVN under a 20-year \npower purchase agreement at a fixed feed-in tariff of $0.0935 per kilowatt-hour. The \ntariff is paid in dong but indexed to the United States dollar. ADB will receive sponsor \nsupport to mitigate key risks from Viet Nam\u2019s standard PPA for renewable energy. \nOperation and        An O&M contract is signed between the borrower and China Energy, by which China \nEnergy will be responsible for O&M for a period of 2 years. After the expiry of the \nmaintenance \ncontract, Phu Yen JSC will continue to outsource O&M through a third party. \nPerformance monitoring  Phu Yen JSC will submit to ADB (i) development effectiveness reports on key \nperformance indicators, (ii) semiannual unaudited and annual audited financial \nstatements, and (iii) environmental and social monitoring reports. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; China Energy = China Energy Engineering Group; EPC = engineering, procurement, \nand construction; O&M = operation and maintenance; PPA = power purchase agreement; Shanxi Electric Power \nEngineering Co., Ltd.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s assistance will have three components: (i) a direct senior secured loan, A loan, of \nup to $27,900,000; (ii) a B loan of up to $148,800,000 to be funded by participating financial \ninstitutions; and (iii) administration of a parallel senior secured loan of up to $9,300,000 to be \nprovided  by  LEAP.  The  A  loan  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  ADB adds value by mobilizing a financing package that makes the project commercially \nviable. International lenders are not comfortable offering long-term US dollar-denominated debt \non a nonrecourse basis in the Vietnamese renewables market because of concerns regarding the \nPPA and the nascency of the sector. Local banks are unable to offer US dollar-denominated \nlonger tenor debt. As one of the first and biggest international limited-recourse project finance \ntransactions in Viet Nam\u2019s renewable energy sector, the project will demonstrate the potential for \nprivate sector investment in the sector, send a strong signal to the market, and attract other \ninvestors for similar investments. ADB has led the structuring of the transaction and is crowding \nin commercial banks under the B loan structure, at a cofinancing ratio of $5.3 for every $1 of ADB \nassistance. ADB will offer a longer tenor than participating commercial banks, helping to improve \n ", "6 \ndebt service coverage ratios for lenders and thereby improve the project\u2019s financial viability. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s support for the project will demonstrate that innovative financing solutions can \naddress existing challenges in this nascent market. The support also contributes to B.Grimm\u2019s \ntarget of increasing the share of renewable energy in its portfolio. ADB\u2019s involvement and due \ndiligence will ensure that the project is developed and operated to international best practice \nstandards and will perform to expectations over the project life. ADB\u2019s participation in the project \nwill enable gender design features and targets to be incorporated, and will also ensure compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s rigorous environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nC.  Risks \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n25.  ADB has categorized the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  B),  and \nindigenous peoples (category B). Safeguard Requirement 4 for existing facilities is applicable.15 \n  \n26.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate for the adverse impacts \nin the safeguard reports and plans. An environmental and social compliance audit was conducted \nin parallel by an independent consultant to assess the project\u2019s performance against ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements. The environmental and social measures and the \ninstitutional capacity and commitment of Phu Yen JSC to manage the project\u2019s social and \nenvironmental impacts are required to be enhanced to ensure the ongoing management of \nsafeguards aspects in compliance with ADB SPS requirements. \n \n27.  Environment. The project\u2019s environmental impact assessment report was prepared in \ncompliance with Vietnamese regulations and approved by the chair of the Provincial People\u2019s \nCommittee in July 2018. The project area has moderately flat plain and semi-mountainous terrain. \nThe project, including the transmission line right-of-way, is not located within or adjacent to any \nenvironmentally sensitive area. It retained the original state of undulating areas and streams \nrunning across the site, and did not undertake any ground leveling. The project considered 100-\nyear  floods  in  its  drainage  system  design.  The  independent  audit  observed  gaps  in  the \nenvironment, health, and safety performance, including (i) the absence of a designated safety \nofficer; (ii) unsafe practices, such as working at heights without proper protection; (iii) improper \nwaste handling, management, and disposal; (iv) poor housekeeping practices (e.g., waste and \ntrash resulting in partial clogging of drains); and (v) inadequate traffic and security management. \nThe audit also noted the lack of a formal grievance redress mechanism for internal and external \nstakeholders. Phu Yen JSC has agreed to implement corrective actions to address the gaps \nbefore  the  loan  drawdown.  During  operation,  the  borrower  will  prepare  an  operational \nenvironmental  and  social  management  plan  that  will  include  mitigation,  monitoring,  and \nmanagement measures for waste handling, pollution prevention, grievances, health, and safety \nprocedures. It will also work on measures to avoid flooding during typhoon seasons. \n \n \n15 ADB. Safeguard Categories. ", "7 \n28.  Social. The project is located on about 262 hectares (ha), of which the government leased \n256 ha to the project for 50 years through the land use rights certificate awarded on 21 June 2019 \nand valid until 5 May 2068. Aside from this, the project directly purchased about 6 ha of land on \na willing seller\u2013willing buyer basis. These have been done in accordance with the expectations of \nthe  affected  land  users.  Before  the  resumption  of  land  rights  (undertaken  before  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement) by the government and the subsequent transfer to the borrower, the land was used \nfor varied agricultural purposes (mostly plantation and single cropping of cassava and sugarcane). \nHowever, the affected land users did not rely heavily on the land for their sustenance or livelihood, \nsince it was not suitable for intensive agriculture or plantation because of poor soil quality. A \nportion of the farmland was also communally owned and included (i) undulating areas and small \nstreams  running  across  the  site,  (ii)  internal  access  roads,  and  (iii) graveyards  for  ethnic \nminorities\u2014the Cham Hoi Roi. Although the affected people were not solely dependent on this \nland for their livelihoods, the project\u2019s land acquisition caused loss of or disruption to the \nlivelihoods of nearly 166 households (approximatively 650 persons). The land transfer and lease \nalso impacted the community graves of the ethnic minorities (16 households comprised of \napproximatively 64 persons). In addition, it disrupted community access to areas adjoining the \nsolar farm. \n \n29.  An independent third party undertook an audit of the land transfer and its impact on  \nexisting users. The audit findings suggest that (i) the resumption and transfer of land rights was \ndone in accordance with statutory requirements, (ii) all affected households were compensated \nfor  loss of income resulting from loss of land and other productive assets, (iii)  no legacy or \nongoing encumbrances or risks are associated with project lands, and (iv) the land and asset \ncompensation  process  provided  enhanced  compensation  and  other  benefits  that  exceed  \nstatutory  requirements  and  were  largely  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements. To support their transition, 118 of the 166 affected households or approximately \n472 persons were given additional allowances (in the form of compensation and optional training). \n \n30.  As mitigation measures for potential residual impacts and in accordance with the audit \nrecommendation, a livelihood restoration plan (LRP) will be prepared and implemented for the \naffected,  vulnerable,  willing  and  suitable  families,  and  a  project  level  grievance  redress \nmechanism will be developed to receive and address potential concerns of the project-affected \npeople by Phu Yen JSC before the first loan disbursement. The LRP will build on the livelihood \nsupport already provided to affected households to address the long-term impact of land and \nlivelihood losses. The LRP will include an assessment of affected households\u2019 socioeconomic \ncondition and the provision of opportunities for skills building and alternative livelihoods to ensure \nthe restoration of sustenance and livelihood status to at least pre-project levels. \n \n31.  The land acquisition included a communal lot used as a graveyard of the Cham Hoi Roi \nethnic group. A total of 18 graves owned by 16 Cham households were transferred to adjoining \nland parcels next to the site boundary. The audit confirmed that the graveyard was relocated in \naccordance with the sociocultural norms and practices of the Cham people. Land for relocation \n(including additional land for future use) has been allocated to the ethnic community. Extensive \nand culturally oriented engagements (meaningful consultations) with the ethnic group (including \nall affected households) were undertaken by the project team; and compensation rates, timelines, \nand  the  process  of  grave  relocation  were  mutually  agreed  through  these  engagements. \nRepresentatives from the village level commune, the tribal chieftain, tribal mayor, and affected \nhouseholds  expressed  satisfaction  with  the  compensation  and  relocation  process  and  the \ncustomary and cultural sensitivities shown by the project. The project has made additional \ncommitments, including the fencing of the new gravesite, construction of a road, and a bridge for \neasy access to the community graves, which are being implemented. The project will (i) continue \n ", "8 \nto engage with the ethnic group in a culturally appropriate manner, and (ii) provide economic \nopportunities  (as  part  of  the  larger  livelihood  restoration  measures)  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment to willing and qualified households of this group of ethnic minorities. \n \n32.
