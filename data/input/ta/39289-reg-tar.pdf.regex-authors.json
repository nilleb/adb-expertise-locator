The adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in September 2000 has \nresulted in an increase in demand for reliable and timely statistical data to assess the impact of \npolicies designed to attain these goals. The need for reliable and timely statistical data has also \nrisen considerably in recent years with adoption of the Managing for Development Results  \napproach, which also uses many MDG indicators, by the international development community \nto monitor development outcomes. Many MDG indicators are compiled from household surveys \nthat are infrequently conducted. In many countries, the time interval between household surveys \ncould be longer than 5 or 10 years, while, in some Pacific countries, household surveys would \nbe conducted only if supported by donor funding. In addition, survey-based MDG data tend to be \nreported at the national level only due to the small survey sample size. Thus, it may not be \npossible  to  assess  progress  made  towards  attaining  the  MDGs  regularly  or  by  various \nsubgroups of the population.     \n \n2.  In principle, many MDG indicators can also be compiled from administrative data, which \nare data collected by the line ministries of a country as part of the programs and policies \nimplemented by those ministries. Administrative data represent a potentially rich and alternative \nsource for compiling these MDG indicators as, compared to survey data, they are collected \nmuch more frequently and at a much lower cost. Such data can also be presented at various \nlevels of disaggregation, such as by geographical location or by gender. In many developing \nmember countries (DMCs), however, administrative data are underutilized in the reporting of \nMDG indicators, as such data tend to be biased by misreporting and incomplete coverage. To \nstrengthen the capacity of DMCs in using administrative data for compiling and monitoring MDG \nindicators,  this  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  is  proposed  to  assess  existing \nadministrative data reporting systems in selected DMCs, clearly identify the key problems with \nthese systems, make recommendations for improvements in the use of the systems, encourage \nthe governments to make effective use of the administrative data, and develop a manual on the \nuse of administrative data for compiling MDG indicators.1 The RETA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Each MDG indicator is monitored according to a standard international definition by one \nor  more  designated  lead  international  agencies,  such  as  the  United  Nations  Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization; World Bank; and World Health Organization. Many MDG \nindicators are derived from household survey data. Due to the relatively small sample size of \nexisting household surveys, such survey-based MDG indicators are only reported at the national \nlevel. Further, they are reported on an ad hoc basis due to the infrequent nature of these \nsurveys.      \n \n4.  There  are,  however,  at  least  three  potential  shortcomings  in  the  current  method  of \nreporting survey-based MDG indicators. First, there is an increasing need for MDG indicators to \nbe compiled in DMCs at the subnational level so that key areas or groups that need intervention \ncan be readily identified. However, using existing household surveys to compile disaggregated \ndata for MDG indicators is likely to result in large sampling errors and render the results \nunreliable. On the other hand, reducing the large sampling errors will require a substantial \nincrease in the sample size for these surveys and a corresponding increase in their costs. \nSecond, there has been an increase in demand for MDG indicators in DMCs to be reported \n                                                 \n1  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 August 2006.  \n ", "2   \nmore frequently, say, annually, and in a more timely manner so that policies can be formulated \nand implemented more quickly to address and tackle any unsatisfactory progress made towards \nattaining any MDG indicator.  Ad hoc household surveys will not be able to satisfy such demand, \nunless they are conducted annually. Moreover, there is a rather long lag between the time the \nresults of household surveys are processed and the estimates for MDG indicators released. \nIncreasing  the  frequency  of  household  surveys,  however,  may  result  in  a  corresponding \nsignificant increase in their costs. Allocating more budget to household surveys in many DMCs \nis not a viable solution to the highlighted issues, given the relatively low priority accorded to \nstatistical activities by their governments. Nor will it address substantially the time lag problem \nassociated  with  these  surveys.  Three,  in  the  context  of  a  basic  results  chain  framework, \nhousehold surveys are useful for compiling impact or outcome indicators, while administrative \ndata are considered more relevant for compiling input and output indicators.  Many countries \ntend to focus on the former and neglect the latter. However, it may not be possible to assess \nthoroughly the effectiveness of development interventions without completing the basic results \nchain with input and output indicators. \n \n5.  The  above  issues  can  be  addressed  by  using  administrative  data  collected  by  the \nappropriate line agencies to compile many of the MDG indicators, especially those related to \neducation, health, and mortality. This is because, unlike household surveys, administrative data \n(i) involve a lower respondent burden, (ii) are collected more frequently, (iii) are less costly to \ncollect and process, and (iv) can be used to produce more timely MDG indicators at various \nlevels of disaggregation without any sampling problems.  \n \n6.  However,  problems  such  as  undercoverage,  misreporting,  possible  difficulties  in \noperationalizing the definitions of MDG indicators, and lack of coordination between the national \nstatistical offices (NSOs) and line agencies responsible for collecting the administrative data \nmean that, at present, such data are usually not fully exploited in many DMCs to compile MDG \nindicators.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The RETA aims to assist DMCs enhance their capacities to compile and monitor MDG \nindicators in a more timely and regular manner by making improvements in the use of their \nadministrative  data  reporting  systems. 2  The  RETA  will  have  two  key  outputs,  namely, \nassessment studies and a manual on the use of administrative data for the compilation of MDG \nindicators.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The RETA will cover six DMCs\u2014Mongolia, Nepal, Palau, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Viet \nNam. The participating DMCs were selected using a variety of criteria, including (i) size of the \ncountry, (ii) budget considerations, (iii) likelihood that these DMCs have administrative data \nreporting systems that can be used to compile MDG indicators, and (iv) likelihood that their \nadministrative data reporting systems are representative of those in the other countries in the \nregions to which they belong.  \n \n                                                 \n2  This will also help to improve the reporting and monitoring of development outcomes under the Managing for \nDevelopment Results approach. \n ", "  3\n9.  The RETA outputs will be obtained through a combination of (i) consulting services, (ii) \ncountry consultations, (iii) support for data collection, (iv) assessment and pilot studies, (v) \nanalysis, and (vi) dissemination. The RETA will include the following key activities: (i) assessing \nthe existing administrative data reporting systems, (ii) recommending improvements in the use \nof  the  systems,  (iii)  implementing  the  recommendations,  (iv)  conducting  training  and  user-\nproducer workshops on the use of administrative data, and (v) developing a manual on the use \nof administrative data to compile MDG indicators. \n \n1.  Assess Existing Administrative Data Reporting Systems  \n \n10.  This component will be carried out in two steps. First, an international consultant will \nreview all the MDG indicators and list those which can be compiled from administrative data. A \nreview  of  the  experience  in  other  regions,  such  as  Africa  and  Latin  America,  in  using \nadministrative data to compile MDG indicators and the evolution of data sources for these \nindicators will also be conducted. Next, in each participating DMC, a national consultant will \nconduct a study (under the guidance and supervision of the international consultant) to assess \nthe strengths and weaknesses of the various administrative data reporting systems (such as the \nvital registration as well as health and education management information systems) in terms of \ntheir  abilities  to  provide  data  to  compute  MDG  indicators  (or  administrative-based  MDG \nindicators) based on such criteria as, among others, (i) attributes of the administrative data \nrecords, (ii) design of forms for collecting the administrative data, (iii) extent of known data gaps, \n(iv) quality  of data records, (v) availability of databases for storing the administrative data \nrecords, (vi) ease with which the data can be used to operationalize the definitions of the MDG \nindicators, and (vii) level of statistical training received by the staff in the line agencies owning \nthe systems. Each study will also determine (i) the extent to which administrative data are \ncurrently being used to compile estimates of MDG indicators; (ii) the extent of coordination \nbetween the owners of the administrative data systems and the NSO in the production of these \nstatistics; (iii) the extent of and reasons for the differences between administrative- and survey-\nbased MDG indicators; (iv) whether the statistics are reported to the lead international agencies \nconcerned;  and  (iv)  the  extent  of  past,  current,  and  planned  assistance  from  the  lead \ninternational agencies to improve the administrative data reporting systems. The assessment \nstudies will be conducted using information already available at Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand  on  the  Internet  websites  of  the  lead  international  agencies,  in  addition  to  information \nprovided by the participating DMCs through e-mail, telephone calls, or visits to the appropriate \nline agencies, if necessary.   \n \n2.  Recommend Improvements in the Use of Administrative Data  \n \n11.  Using the results of the assessment studies, the national consultants, in consultation with \nthe international consultant and with the NSOs and line agencies in their respective countries, \nwill prepare recommendations to improve the use of these systems to generate administrative-\nbased MDG indicators. These will include, among others, (i) developing appropriate statistical \ntechniques and methods to deal with problems such as undercoverage and misreporting, ensure \nthe administrative-based MDG indicators are compiled according to the respective standard \ninternational definitions, and reconcile these indicators with those obtained from household \nsurveys; (ii) preparing appropriate templates to collect data which conform to the standard \ninternational definitions of the indicators; (iii) developing a system of checks and balances to \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \naudit, verify and validate the data records; and (iv) presenting the subnational data in various \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nc ategories.3 The  recommendations  will  be  prepared  with  a  special  emphasis  on  those \n                                                 \n3  Where  appropriate,  the  recommendations,  especially  those  on  statistical  techniques  and  methods,  will  be \n ", "4   \nadministrative-based MDG indicators where lead international agencies are not already much \ninvolved in their improvement. As far as possible, the national consultants will also ensure that \nthe recommendations can be implemented in a cost-effective manner without any major revamp \nof the existing administrative data reporting systems. \n \n3.  Implement Recommendations  \n \n12.  In each participating DMC, the proposed recommendations will be pilot-tested for a few \nadministrative-based MDG indicators. The results will be analyzed and, where appropriate, \ncross-checked with existing survey-based estimates. After that, the recommendations will be \nfine-tuned before they are extended to the rest of the administrative-based MDG indicators, with \nappropriate modifications made to accommodate the different features of the administrative data \nreporting systems in these DMCs. Particular attention will be paid to ensure that the finalized \nstatistical techniques and methods produce estimates for administrative-based MDG indicators \nthat can be harmonized with the survey-based ones. In addition, as the implementation of these \nrecommendations will most likely require the use of administrative data records to produce \nbackdated estimates of administrative-based MDG indicators for analysis and assessment, it will \nbe conducted in close collaboration with the line agencies.   \n \n4.  Conduct User-Producer and Training Workshops \n \n13.  User-producer workshops will be held in each participating DMC to discuss the results of \nthe implementation component and gather feedback on the validity of the results. Training \nworkshops will be organized to train the staff of the line agencies and NSOs on the appropriate \nuse of administrative data to produce administrative-based MDG indicators according to the \nstandard international definitions and on how to analyze, report and monitor the results.4   \n \n5.  Develop Manual on Use of Administrative Data to Compile MDG Indicators \n \n14.  This component will develop a manual on the use of administrative data to compute \nMDG indicators. This MDG indicators manual will be written in close consultation with key \nstakeholders, such as the NSOs and line agencies in the participating DMCs and the respective \nlead international agencies for the MDG indicators. Among other things, the manual will include \nguidelines on how to validate the data as well as statistical techniques and methods to correct \nfor undercoverage and misreporting in the systems; adjust the data so that they conform to the \nstandard international definitions of the respective indicators; and ensure harmonization of the \nestimates computed using administrative data and household survey data. The manual will also \ninclude samples of templates for collecting data that can be readily used to operationalize the \ndefinitions of the indicators.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The  total  cost  of  the  RETA  is  estimated  to  be  $500,000.  This  includes  consulting \nservices, country visits, assessment and pilot studies, as well as workshops. The RETA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. The detailed cost \nestimates are given in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                                                                                                                           \nformulated in consultation with the project officers for the RETA on Measurement and Policy Analysis for Poverty \nReduction. This is to ensure no overlap and exploit any synergies between the two projects.  \n4  Resources permitting, resource persons from the United Nations Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific  will be \ninvited to conduct the training workshops together with the national consultants. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, while its administration will be handled \nby the Economics and Research Department (ERD). The RETA will be implemented from \nJanuary  2007  to  December  2008.  Where  appropriate,  it  will  be  implemented  in  close \nconsultation with the Poverty Unit of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department \nand lead international agencies so as to avoid any overlap of activities. NSOs in the participating \nDMCs will also be consulted in order to tap their institutional knowledge of the statistical systems \nin their respective countries. The regional departments will be kept updated on the progress of \nthe RETA through meetings of the Technical Working Group on Statistical Capacity Building, \nwhich comprises staff of ERD and the regional departments, and by e-mail to its members. \n \n17.  The  RETA  will  finance  35  person-months  of  consulting  services:  1  international \nconsultant  (5  person-months)  and  6  national  consultants  (5  person-months  each).  The \nconsultants will be selected and engaged individually, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  The national consultants, in consultation with ERD and the line agencies and NSOs of \nthe participating DMCs, will undertake the country assessment studies, make recommendations \nfor  improvements,  implement  the  recommendations,  and  conduct  local  user-producer  and \ntraining workshops under the overall guidance of the international consultant.5 The national \nconsultants  will  submit  their  reports  within  2  weeks  after  completing  each  portion  of  their \nassignments. An inception meeting involving the international and national consultants will be \nheld before the start of the country assessment studies to determine the approach to these \nstudies and to preparing the MDG indicators manual. The results and recommendations of the \ncountry assessment studies, approach to implementing the recommendations, and outline of the \nmanual will be discussed at a regional workshop in June 2007. This workshop will be attended \nby high-level officials of the participating DMCs, among others.6 The intention is to secure their \ncommitment to implement the recommendations. \n \n19.  The international consultant will consolidate all the results of the various studies and \nprior  workshops  and  prepare  the  draft  MDG  indicators  manual.  The  draft  manual  will  be \ndiscussed at the RETA concluding workshop in October 2008. The concluding workshop will be \nattended by senior staff of the NSOs and appropriate line agencies of the participating DMCs, \nstaff of the regional departments and/or regional missions, international and national consultants, \nand resource persons from the lead international agencies, among others. The international \nconsultant will finalize the manual, after incorporating the comments and suggestions of the \nworkshop participants, and submit it to ADB by the end of November 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nImproving Administrative Data Sources for the Monitoring of the Millennium Development Goal \nIndicators, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n T  h  e    v i e  w  s    e  x p  r e  s  s e  d    h  e  r e  in    a  r e    those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n5m  Wemhebreer sn,e cBeosasradry o, ft hDei rienctetornrast,i oMnaaln caognesmuletanntt,  woirl l satalsfof,  gaunidde m aanyd  bsuep perrevilsime imnaorrey  icnlo nsaeltyu rtehe.   national consultants \nfrom participating DMCs with very low levels of statistical capacity, or perform the tasks of the national consultants \n \nif no suitable consultants are available. \n6  Resources permitting, resource persons from the United Nations Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific will be \ninvited to conduct seminars on statistical techniques and analysis during the workshop. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved monitoring of  Up to half of  Publications, reports, and  \u2022  There are no drastic \nMDG indicators on a  participating DMCs  websites on MDG  changes in the policies \nregular and timely basis  regularly and  monitoring  and procedures to \nin participating DMCs  sustainably produce,  collect administrative \n  disseminate, and  data in participating \nmonitor timely and  DMCs. \nreliable MDG indicators   \nusing administrative  Risk \ndata after the RETA.  \u2022  Government agencies in \nparticipating DMCs \ncease to collect \nadministrative data. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced capacity of  Up to half of  Publications, reports, and  \u2022  Participating DMCs are \nadministrative data  participating DMCs are  communications with  willing to use \nreporting systems to  able to increase by up  participating DMCs  administrative data to \ngenerate MDG  to 50% the number of  generate MDG \nindicators in  MDG indicators  indicators. \nparticipating DMCs  generated using   \nadministrative data.   \u2022  Participating DMCs are \nable to implement the \nrecommendations. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Where necessary, he or she will supervise and guide more closely national consultants \nfrom DMCs with low levels of statistical capacity or perform their tasks if no suitable national \nconsultants are available. \n \n2.  In particular, the consultant will perform the following tasks: \n(i)  Review all MDG indicators and determine which ones can be generated using \nadministrative data records, with an emphasis on the participating DMCs. \n(ii)  Review the experience of other regions (for example, Africa and Latin America) \nin using administrative data to compile MDG indicators. \n(iii)  Review the development of data sources for the compilation of MDG indicators \nsince the adoption of the MDGs. \n(iv)  Develop a detailed framework to guide the national consultants in their studies to \nassess  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  administrative  data  reporting \nsystems in the participating DMCs in terms of their ability to provide data to \ngenerate MDG indicators and present this at the inception meeting organized by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n(v)  Work with the national consultants to gather information from all sources based \non the requirements of the framework.  \n(vi)  Review  the  results  of  the  assessment  studies  conducted  by  the  national \nconsultants and the recommendations made.  \n(vii)  Develop  a  comprehensive  framework  to  guide  the  national  consultants  to \nimplement the recommendations and validate and improve the results, taking into \nconsideration the special circumstances of each participating DMC. \n(viii)  Review  the  results  of  the  implementation  studies  conducted  by  the  national \nconsultants and make suggestions for enhancements, where appropriate. \n(ix)  Assist and guide the national consultants in conducting local user-producer and \ntraining workshops, and provide other needed assistance to regional, local, and \nconcluding workshops and other meetings.  \n(x)  Prepare an outline for the manual on the use of administrative data to compile \nMDG indicators and present it at the regional workshop organized by ADB. \n(xi)  Prepare the draft manual, taking into consideration the experiences of DMCs in \nusing  such  data  to  compile  the  indicators,  and  present  it  at  the  concluding \nworkshop organized by ADB. \n(xii)  Submit the final manual and final report to ADB at the end of the assignment.  \n(xiii)  Participate in the inception meeting to discuss the approach to the assessment \nstudies and preparation of the manual, regional workshop to discuss the findings \nand recommendations of the assessment studies and outline of the manual, \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \nconcluding workshop to discuss the draft manual, as well as other meetings and \nworkshops organized by ADB. \n \nB.  Six National Statistics Consultants (5 person-months each, intermittent) \n3.  The national statistics consultants should have strong backgrounds in statistics and/or \neconomics; extensive prior working experience in their respective NSOs and, preferably, in the \ndata  collection  and  data  management  departments  of  government  agencies  that  own  the \nadministrative data reporting systems; and sufficient practical knowledge of how MDG indicators \nare computed in their respective DMCs. The national consultants should also have the expertise \nto assess the strengths and weaknesses of the administrative data reporting systems in their \nrespective DMCs, especially in terms of their capabilities to generate MDG indicators at the \nnational and subnational levels, and be proficient in the use of statistical software packages.   \n \n4.  Under the overall guidance and supervision of the international consultant, each national \nconsultant will \n(i)  Conduct  an  assessment  study  of  the  various  administrative  data  reporting \nsystems in his or her country, identifying their strengths and weaknesses in terms \nof their readiness for the compilation of MDG indicators and making appropriate \nrecommendations for improvements to the use of the systems. He or she will \nwork in close consultation with the NSO and government agencies owning the \nsystems. \n(ii)  Submit a report on the findings of the assessment study and recommendations \n(with  due  care  to  ensure  that  these  can  be implemented  in  a  cost-effective \nmanner without any substantial overhaul of the administrative data  reporting \nsystems) to ADB and present them at the regional workshop organized by ADB.  \nRecommendations will include (a) developing appropriate statistical techniques \nand methods to deal with such problems as undercoverage and misreporting, \ncompile  administrative-based  MDG  indicators  that  are  consistent  with  the \nstandard international definitions and reconcile the estimates with survey-based \nestimates; (b) preparing templates to collect data that conform to the standard \ninternational definitions of the indicators; (c) developing a system to validate the \ndata records; and (d) presenting the subnational data in various categories. \n(iii)  Conduct pilot tests to implement recommendations for a few MDG indicators, \nanalyze the results, fine-tune the recommendations, and extend these to the \nother MDG indicators and analyze the results.  \n(iv)  Conduct  local  user-producer  workshops  to  discuss  the  results  of  the \nimplementation phase  and submit a report on the results to ADB. \n(v)  Conduct local training workshops to train the staff of the NSO and relevant \ngovernment  agencies  to  (a)  implement  the  recommendations  made;  and  (b) \ninterpret, analyze and monitor the results. Submit a report to ADB regarding the \nworkshops. \n(vi)  Provide inputs to the preparation of the manual on the use of administrative data \nto compile MDG indicators. \n(vii)  Participate in the inception meeting to discuss the approach to the assessment \nstudies and preparation of the manual, regional workshop to discuss the findings \nand recommendations of the assessment studies and outline of the manual, \nconcluding workshop to discuss the draft manual, as well as other meetings and \nworkshops organized by ADB. \n(viii)  Submit a final report to ADB at the end of the assignment. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061207153130+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061127101556+08'00'", "Title": "Improving Administrative Data Sources for the Monitoring of the Millennium Development Goal Indicators", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "Author": ""}, "author_page": " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  DMC  \u2013  developing member country \n  ERD  \u2013  Economics and Research Department \n  MDG  \u2013  Millennium Development Goal  \n  NSO  \u2013  national statistical office  \n  RETA  \u2013  regional technical assistance \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  Targeted intervention (supporting the Millennium Development \nGoals) \nSector  \u2013  Multisector \nSubsector  \u2013  Education, health, water \nThemes  \u2013  Capacity development, governance, inclusive social development  \nSubthemes  \u2013  Organizational development, public governance, human \ndevelopment \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \nVice President  U.
