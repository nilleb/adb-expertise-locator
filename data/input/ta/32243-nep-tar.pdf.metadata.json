His Majesty's Government of Nepal requested assistance from the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) for an agriculture sector performance review.1 This technical assistance (TA) is\nbased on the discussions between the Government and ADB during the Rural Asia Workshop\njointly organized in February 2000 by the Government, the Food and Agriculture Organization of\nthe United Nations, and ADB. The ADB Reconnaissance Mission visited Nepal in March 2000\nand Fact-Finding Mission in July 2000. These missions met with representatives of Government\nagencies, the private sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and major bilateral and\nmultilateral funding agencies in Nepal. The missions' findings and understandings with the\nGovernment  form  the  basis  for  the  TA  design.  The  TA  is  included  in  the  ADB\u2019s  country\nassistance plan for 2000. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\n \nI I.     BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n \n2. In Nepal, agriculture has a dominant role in the national economy, accounting for about\n80 percent of the total labor force and about 40 percent of gross domestic product. Of the total\nland area of 14.7 million hectares (ha), 2.9 million ha or 20 percent are cultivated. About 70\npercent of agricultural landholdings are less than 1 ha in size. These landholdings are highly\nfragmented  with  an  average  of  four  parcels  of  land  per  farm  household  in  the  country.2\nAgricultural landholdings in the hilly and mountainous regions are more fragmented reflecting\nthe scarcity of contiguous land. Six major crops, including rice, maize, wheat, millet, barley, and\npotatoes, account for more than 80 percent of the gross cropped area. The irrigable area is\nestimated at 2.2 million ha or 76 percent of the total cultivated area, of which about 1.1 million ha\nreceive some form of irrigation. Most farmers are engaged in subsistence-oriented food-grain\nproduction. Livestock contributes to about 15 percent of the farm household income. More than\nhalf of farm households are engaged in livestock activities such as raising cattle, goat, buffalo,\nand poultry.\n3. Based on the altitude differences between the south and the north, Nepal can be broadly\ndivided into three distinctive ecological regions: lowland, hilly, and mountainous. A large-scale\nmigration of people from the hilly and mountainous regions since the 1950s has led to rapid\npopulation  growth  in  the  lowlands.  This  has  somewhat  alleviated  the  serious  food  deficit\nsituation in the hilly and mountainous regions, but resulted in rapid degradation of large forest\nareas  in  the  lowlands  as  they  were  converted  into  agricultural  land.  In  addition,  intensive\ncropping  over  many  years  with  inadequate  nutrient  replenishment  and  poor  cultivation\ntechniques has degraded the soil nutrient status of farms in the lowland region.\n4. High priority has been given to the agriculture sector in public expenditures with about\none quarter of the country's development budget allocated to the sector during the last five\nyears. However, the yield of major food crops has been increasing slowly. The yield of rice and\nwheat in Nepal is the lowest in South Asia, although it was the highest in the region about 40\nyears ago.3 Nepal's food-grain production increased by an average of 1.8 percent per annum\nbetween FY1991 and FY1998, while the population increased by an average of 2.3 percent per\n                                            \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet) on 23 June 2000.\n2 Central Bureau of Statistics. 1999. Statistical Yearbook of Nepal 1999. His Majesty's Government of Nepal,\nKathmandu.\n3 National Planning Commission. 1995. Nepal: Agriculture Perspective Plan. His Majesty's Government of Nepal,\nKathmandu.", "2\nannum. Thus, per capita food-grain production declined from 315 kilograms in FY1991 to 290\nkilograms in FY1998. Nepal has been a net food importer for more than a decade.\n5. To reverse this disappointing performance, the Government launched important policy\nand institutional reforms for the agriculture sector in line with the 20-year Agriculture Perspective\nPlan (APP) and the Second Agriculture Program.4 The APP has been adopted by successive\ngovernments since approval in 1995, and aims to (i) accelerate agricultural growth by increasing\ntotal  factor  productivity,  (ii)  reduce  poverty  and  improve  the  people's  standard  of  living\nparticularly  in  rural  areas,  and  (iii)  transform  the  subsistence-oriented  agriculture  into  a\ncommercial one by diversifying and increasing interregional trade in the country.\n6. The APP's strategy for developing the lowland region is basically a green revolution\npackage  with  a  combination  of  improved  seeds,  fertilizer,  and  controlled  water  supply  for\nintensified crop production. The strategy for the hilly and mountainous regions emphasizes the\npromotion of high-value agriculture and livestock products. These products offer the opportunity\nfor high income per unit area, which is particularly important in areas where agricultural land is\nextremely  limited.  The  APP  stresses  the  need  for  greatly  expanded  agricultural  trade\ninteractions between the hilly and mountainous regions and the lowland region in view of the\npotential complementarity between regions. To establish such linkage, the APP calls for a\nmarket-oriented approach based on the initiatives of the private sector.\n7. Initially, implementation of the APP was not smooth. Agricultural growth lagged behind\nthe APP target figures, and the record in fulfilling the key policy and institutional reforms was\nmixed.  Subsequently,  important  developments  were  accomplished  in  deregulating  the\nagriculture sector. In the fertilizer trade, substantial progress was made by removing fiscal\nconstraints to increasing the supply of fertilizers and private sector participation in the trade.\nImported fertilizer volume has increased by more than 50 percent since the fertilizer trade was\nderegulated in 1998. In the irrigation subsector, the new irrigation policy approved in 1997\nincreased the level of beneficiary participation and accelerated the rate of management transfer\nof surface schemes to water user groups. The Government introduced measures to increase\nwater use efficiency by improving the collection of water user fees and reducing subsidies for\ngroundwater  irrigation  schemes.  Reforms  were  also  initiated  to  streamline  agricultural\ncorporations in the public sector and redefine their roles.\n8. These reform measures were introduced over three years since 1997. The Government\nis now at a critical stage to ensure the sustainable impact of these measures and the smooth\ntransition of the agriculture sector to the market-oriented framework. For instance, despite the\nderegulation  of  markets  for  agricultural  inputs,  private  sector  participation  in  the  trade  of\nfertilizers and seeds needs to be further promoted. In irrigation, the Government needs to\ncontinue  its  efforts  to  transfer  responsibility  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  public\nirrigation schemes to water user associations, and to promote irrigation development in the\nlowland region. To expedite APP implementation, increased efforts are required to improve the\nperformance of other subsectors by introducing specific action plans.\n9. Under these circumstances, this TA will conduct a comprehensive sector performance\nreview, including assessing the outcome and impact of the Government's reform measures on\nthe  overall  economy  and  on  the  Government's  primary  development  objective  of  poverty\nreduction.  Based  on  this  review,  specific  action  plans  for  agricultural  development  will  be\ndeveloped and implementation initiated. The priority strategic areas broadly identified by the\n                                            \n4  Loan 1604-NEP[SF]: Second Agriculture Program, for $50.0 million, approved on 22 January 1998.", "3\nAPP will be elaborated under the TA so that the Government can focus its efforts on measures\nto  facilitate  APP  implementation.  During  TA  preparation,  discussions  were  held  with  key\nstakeholders in both the public and private sectors, and major external funding agencies. A\nparticipatory process based on extensive consultations with these stakeholders will be adopted\nduring  TA  implementation.  This  will  enhance  ADB's  dialogue  and  collaboration  with  other\nexternal funding agencies, and promote concerted efforts to examine and address issues in the\nagriculture sector.\n III.    THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n \n A. Objective\n \n10. The objective of the TA is to help the Government conduct a comprehensive review of\nagriculture sector performance and formulate measures to facilitate APP implementation.\nB. Scope\n11. The TA will (i) conduct an analytical review of the current situation and performance of\nthe agriculture sector in Nepal, (ii) assess the progress and impact of the Government\u2019s reform\nmeasures  launched  under  the  APP  and  the  Second  Agriculture  Program,  (iii)  examine\nprocesses and mechanisms to sustain the effects of such reform measures, (iv) identify critical\nissues and gaps remaining as constraints to APP implementation and to overall agricultural\ndevelopment, and (v) assist the Government in preparing specific medium-term action plans for\nagricultural development in line with the APP. The TA will contribute to the agriculture and rural\ndevelopment section of the forthcoming Tenth Plan (FY2003\u2013FY2007) of the Government. The\nTA will be implemented through a wide consultation process in the country, involving key\nstakeholders in the sector including farmers, local administrations, NGOs, private dealers of\nagricultural inputs and outputs, and other external funding agencies, so that general consensus\nand ownership for implementation of sector reforms will emerge. The outline terms of reference\nfor the consulting services under the TA are in Appendix 2.\n \n C. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n \n12. The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $710,000  equivalent,  comprising  $441,000  in  foreign\nexchange costs and $269,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $600,000 to\nfinance the entire foreign exchange costs and a part of the local currency costs, amounting to\n$159,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special\nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The balance of the local currency costs, amounting to\n$110,000 equivalent, will be met by the Government from its own resources to cover office\naccommodation,  counterpart  staff  support,  facilities  for  seminars  and  meetings,  and  other\nadministrative expenses at the central and local levels. Data and information required for TA\nactivities will be provided by the Government. A Government representative will be invited as an\nobserver for TA contract negotiations. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.", "4\n D. Implementation Arrangements\n \n13. The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives\n(MOAC). MOAC will establish a TA implementation unit, and appoint a TA project director and at\nleast one full-time counterpart staff assigned to the TA. District offices of MOAC's Department of\nAgriculture will provide necessary field support for TA activities, including liaison with relevant\nagencies and translation. Since the TA will cover several subsectors encompassing different\nministries, the Government will need to establish an interministerial TA steering committee and\na  counterpart  working  group  to  ensure  a  holistic  approach  to  the  TA  through  effective\ninteractions and coordination of the relevant ministries. This committee will be in place before\nTA  inception.  The  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  MOAC  and  include\nrepresentatives from the National Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Water\nResources, Ministry of Local Development, Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation, Nepal\nRastra Bank, other relevant Government agencies, and at least two representatives of the\nprivate sector, including those of the Federation of Nepal Chambers of Commerce and Industry,\nand major NGOs involved in the agriculture sector. The committee's meetings will be organized\nprior to the tripartite review meetings to consolidate the committee's views on the TA. The TA\nproject director will act as a member-secretary for the committee. The counterpart working group\nwill comprise staff of the Government and private sector agencies to closely work with the TA\nconsulting team. ADB will form a task force, comprising staff of the relevant ADB departments\nand offices, to review the TA outputs.\n14. The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  nine  months  from  February  to  November  2001.\nTripartite review meetings of the Government, the TA consultant, and ADB will be chaired by the\nMOAC secretary, and organized three times to review TA implementation progress, resolve any\noutstanding issues, and provide necessary guidance to the TA consultants.\n \n15. The TA requires 15 person-months of international consulting services in the fields of (i)\nagricultural policy and team leadership, (ii) institutional assessment, and (iii) rural finance; and\n30 person-months of domestic consulting in the fields of (i) agricultural economics and deputy\nteam leadership, (ii) irrigation, (iii) agriculture, (iv) forestry and environment, (v) livestock, (vi)\nagrarian law, and (vii) social and participatory assessment. These consulting services will be\nprovided by an international consulting firm in association with qualified domestic consulting\nfirms that have sound financial positions, sufficient experience and knowledge in the agriculture\nsector, and an adequate number of qualified staff.\n \n16. The selection and engagement of the TA consultant will be undertaken in accordance\nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nfor the engagement of domestic consultants. The technical proposals invited from the shortlisted\nconsulting firms will be in ADB\u2019s simplified formats. The consultant will purchase necessary\noffice  equipment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  The  equipment\nprocured under the TA will be handed over to MOAC at TA completion. The consultant will\norganize a series of stakeholder meetings at the central and local levels during the TA. National\nand regional seminars will be organized before the TA's interim and final tripartite review\nmeetings. The consultant will ensure participation of key public and private sector stakeholders\nin  these  meetings  and  seminars.  These  processes  are  also  important  to  build  general\nconsensus and ownership among the stakeholders for the implementation of further sector\nreforms.\n17. The  consultants  will  prepare  (i)  an  inception  report  including  a  detailed  TA  work\nprogram, to be submitted within three weeks of TA inception and discussed at the inception", "5\ntripartite review meeting; (ii) an interim report to be submitted within four months of TA start-up,\nwhich  will  present  the  interim  TA  findings,  and  will  be  discussed  at  regional  seminars,\nstakeholder meetings, and the interim tripartite review meeting; (iii) a draft final report within\nseven months of TA start-up, to be discussed at the regional and national seminars, and at the\nfinal tripartite review meeting; and (iv) a final report at TA completion. In addition, technical\ndiscussion papers will be prepared for the seminars and meetings; the proceedings will be\nrecorded. The interim report will consist of an executive summary and a main report. The draft\nfinal and final reports will comprise an executive summary, a main report, subsector reports,\nand appendixes containing relevant data and information. Twenty copies of each report will be\nprepared, including 5 copies for ADB and 15 for the Government. In addition, the executive\nsummary and the main report of the final report will be translated into Nepali, and 100 copies of\nthe executive summary and 15 copies of the main report will be provided to the Government for\ncirculation to relevant parties, including district development committees. Data and information\nprepared and stored in electronic computers will be provided to ADB and the Government in a\nreadily usable format.\nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n18. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to His Majesty's Government of Nepal in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of the Agriculture Sector\nPerformance Review, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n ", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Monitoring Assumptions and\nIndicators Mechanisms Risks\nSector/Area Goal\nSustainable growth in \u2022  Average sector \u2022  Economic survey Political stability in\nagricultural production growth rate and national the country\nsustainable at statistics for the\nabout 5 percent agriculture sector Favorable weather\nper annum by conditions\n2015 in line with \u2022  Regular dialogue\nthe Agriculture and interactions with Reduction in\nPerspective Plan key stakeholders, population growth\n(APP) including farmers,\nlocal Establishment of a\n\u2022  Annual per capita administrations, better public-private\nfood-grain private traders, partnership for\nproduction to nongovernment agricultural\nreach 426 organizations, and development\nkilograms by 2015 major external\nin line with the funding agencies\nAPP\n\u2022  Local consultative\n\u2022  Yield of major group meetings of\ncrops reaching the external funding\nlevels of other agencies in Nepal\nSouth Asian\ncountries \u2022  Asian Development\nBank (ADB) review\nmissions and\nReduction in rural \u2022  Poverty incidence tripartite review\npoverty to decrease to meetings for the\nabout 14 percent technical assistance\nby 2015 in line (TA)\nwith the APP\n\u2022  Progress reports\n\u2022  Human and other consultant\ndevelopment reports prepared\nindex to under the TA\nsubstantially\nincrease from the \u2022  TA completion\ncurrent estimate of report\n0.474 to higher\nthan 0.500 to\nqualify for the\nmedium human\ndevelopment\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 1)", "7\nAppendix 1, page 2\nDesign Summary Performance Monitoring Assumptions and\nIndicators Mechanisms Risks\nPurpose\nComprehensive \u2022  Environment \u2022  Regular dialogue Accuracy in the APP's\nreview of agriculture favorable for and interactions analysis of basic\nsector performance for private sector with key weaknesses in the\neffective participation stakeholders. country's agriculture\nimplementation of the created sector\nAPP \u2022  Local consultative\n\u2022  Effective tripartite group meetings Continued\nrelationship among among external Government\nthe public sector, funding agencies in commitment to its\nprivate sector, and Nepal policy for economic\nexternal funding liberalization\nagencies in place \u2022  ADB review\nmissions and Timely support from\ntripartite review external funding\nmeetings for the TA agencies for the\nGovernment's policy\n\u2022  Progress reports and institutional\nand other reforms\nconsultant reports\nprepared under the\nTA\n\u2022  TA completion\nreport\nOutputs\n1.
