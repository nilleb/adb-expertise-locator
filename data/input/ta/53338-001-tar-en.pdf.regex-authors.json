INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the government implement \nthe Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act, 2018 (Republic Act \nNo. 11032) by procuring a modern, web-based corporate registration system (CRS) through a \nlicense agreement.1 The new CRS will help the government simplify the process and cut the time \nneeded to register a business and reduce corruption, in line with the Revised Corporation Code \nAct, 2019 (Republic Act No. 11232). The new CRS will also improve the Philippines\u2019 overall \nranking in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business report. This will encourage business formation and \ninvestment, leading to increased employment and reduced poverty. The TA, which was requested \nby  the  government,  is  included  in the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  operations \nbusiness plan for 2020 and is consistent with the ADB country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132023, \nfor the Philippines through the crosscutting theme of private sector development, specifically by \npromoting ease of doing business; and is included in the ADB country operations business plan \nfor 2020.2 The TA is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, as it will (i) address remaining \npoverty and reduce inequalities by facilitating job creation, and (ii) strengthen governance and \ninstitutional capacity of the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) of the Philippines.3 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n  \n2.  The government has long recognized the importance of an enabling business environment \nto drive private sector-led economic growth. In 2005, it created the Public\u2013Private Sector Task \nForce on Philippine Competitiveness to promote a national competitiveness agenda. In 2011, the \ntask force was renamed the National Competitiveness Council and transformed into a formal \noversight and coordinating body. The Anti-Red Tape Act (ARTA), 2007 (Republic Act No. 9485) \nestablished  service  standards  across  various  specific  areas  of  the  government,  including \nmaximum processing times for certain applications. The Go Negosyo Act, 2013 (Republic Act \nNo. 10644) was enacted to support and encourage the creation of micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises (MSMEs). In 2016, the government adopted the Philippine Development Plan \n(PDP), 2017\u201320224 as the first of four PDPs designed to achieve the goals of AmBisyon Natin \n2040.5 The PDP is based on the government\u2019s 10-point socioeconomic agenda, which aims to \nreduce  poverty  and  achieve  middle-income  status  by  the  end  of  2022  by  improving \ncompetitiveness and the ease of doing business, among others. The Ease of Doing Business and \nEfficient  Government  Service  Delivery  Act  amended  and  bolstered  the  ARTA  to  reduce \nimpediments to business creation and operation. The amended ARTA established a formal \nrequirement for government agencies to conduct regulatory impact assessments on proposed \nlegislation,  established  operational  oversight  for  the  quality  of  individual  regulatory  impact \nassessments through the Anti-Red Tape Authority,6 and provided for congressional oversight of \nthe implementation of the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act. \n \n1  A CRS is a register of organizations in the jurisdiction in which they operate. Each country\u2019s corporate register has \ndifferent types of registrars, content, purpose, and public availability. Denmark and the United Kingdom lead in \nopenness of the information available in a company\u2019s register (https://opencorporates.com/info/about/). \n2  ADB. 2018.

Manila.  \n6  The Anti-Red Tape Authority is a government agency created by Republic Act No. 11032 (Section 17) to monitor \nand ensure compliance with the national policy on anti-red tape and ease of doing business in the Philippines.  \n ", "2 \nFinally, the Corporation Code was revised in 2019 (Republic Act No. 11232), streamlining the \ncorporate registration process.  \n \n3.  To implement this reform agenda, the government has directed development partner \nsupport  to  help  address  the  identified  development  constraints.  ADB\u2019s  Increasing \nCompetitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program improved the investment climate, made the labor \nmarket more inclusive, and helped selected sectors become more competitive.7 The program also \nestablished the Office for Competition within the Department of Justice.8This program was rated \n \nhighly successful, and the lessons learned from it have been incorporated in the proposed TA.9 \nFor example, an in-depth understanding of institutional capacities, together with proper timing and \nsequencing, are factors for success. In addition, ADB\u2019s finance sector programs have contributed \nto expanding the capital markets and increased MSMEs\u2019 access to formal banking services, \nespecially agriculture MSMEs.10 A labor market reform program is providing youth with the skills \nneeded to join the labor market.11 ADB is also strengthening corporate governance through \nregional capital market TA.12 The United States Agency for International Development is helping \nto strengthen the judicial system through its Judicial Strengthening to Improve Court Effectiveness \nProgram, which aims to strengthen the enforcement of contracts and reduce court delays. \n \n4.  These  efforts  have  produced  tangible  results.  The  Philippines  ranked  124th  out  of \n190 economies in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2019, below Singapore (2nd), Malaysia \n(15th), Thailand (27th), Viet Nam (69th), and Indonesia (73rd).13 Doing Business 2020 raised the \nPhilippines\u2019 overall ranking to 95th out of 190 economies compared with Singapore (2nd), \nMalaysia (12th), Thailand (21st), Viet Nam (70th), and Indonesia (73rd).14 Improvements have \nbeen noted in getting credit (up 52 places to rank 132nd), which reflects increasing coverage of \nthe credit registry, the recent adoption of a legal framework to support the use of movable \ncollateral, and initiatives to protect minority shareholders (up 60 places to rank 72nd). However, \nthe Philippines\u2019 score for starting a business deteriorated (down five places to 171st). To start a \nbusiness in the Philippines, companies must complete up to 13 procedures, which could take up \nto  33  days  and  cost  about  $2,000.  This  situation  compares  unfavorably  with  Malaysia \n(9 procedures and 13 days) and Thailand (5 procedures and 5 days). In New Zealand (ranked \n1st), starting a business requires only one procedure and takes half a day to process. \n  \n5.  To start a business in the Philippines, companies must register through the existing CRS, \nwhich the SEC administers. However, the existing CRS is unable to support the current business \nregistration volume within the legislated timelines. For example, the existing CRS processed \n \n7  ADB. 2012.

Washington, D.C. \n ", "3 \nbusiness applications within 3 days for only 68% of the cases in 2018 and only 43% of the cases \nin 2019.15 Diagnostics indicate that the existing CRS has design flaws and was not built to handle \nthe current volume of transactions. The storage capacity is inadequate, contributing to the large \nbacklog of business applications and slowing down processing during high loads. In addition, the \nexisting system requires preregistration for a tax identification number (TIN), the Social Security \nSystem, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, and the Home Development Mutual Fund \n(Pag-IBIG Fund). In total, this process takes 13 days, with another day needed to process the \nregistration payment.16 The local municipality where the business will be located must also issue \na business permit. In Quezon City, the issuance of a business permit takes 6 days.17 The applicant \nthen finalizes the issuance of its TIN through a manual process which takes about 3 days. The \nremainder of the process is consumed by sourcing printed materials to satisfy the requirements \nof the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Overall, the registration process under the existing CRS is \noverly reliant on manual procedures. The staff of the SEC requires additional technical capacity \nto operate and maintain the existing CRS, as upgrades and development of efficiency measures \nare both challenging. The inability to enforce a zero-contact policy introduces inefficiencies and \nprovides avenues for corruption. Beyond the existing CRS, the time required to start a business \ncould be substantially shortened through the development of a single-window one-stop process. \n \n6.  Onerous regulations and business start-up processes exact a disproportionate cost on \nsmall businesses. Making regulations easier to understand and reducing the time and costs \nassociated with compliance will help businesses, especially MSMEs, to prosper in their local \ncommunities and through international trade.18 The growth of small businesses contributes to \nhigher  employment,  incomes,  and  well-being.19 In  the  Philippines,  more  must  be  done  to \n \nstreamline and consolidate corporate registration and administration. A new, more efficient CRS \ncan serve as an anchor for ongoing efforts to improve the business environment, including the \nplanned development of a single-window one-stop business registration process, which will \nproduce real efficiencies and significantly improve the Philippines\u2019 ease of doing business rating. \n \n7.  Easing impediments to doing business can also play an integral role in the government\u2019s \nstrategy to bounce back from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The extended \nlockdown implemented to flatten the infection rate also extracted a significant toll on the economy. \nThe gross domestic product is expected to contract by 7.3% in 2020 down from the  6.0% growth \noriginally forecast.20 The April 2020 labor force survey showed the unemployment rate at 17.7%. \nAn additional 5.5 million Filipinos are expected to fall into poverty, with poverty incidence \nestimated to rise to 20.7% in 2020.21 To counter the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the \ngovernment launched an overarching response under the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, 2020 \n(Republic Act No. 11469), which granted the President expanded powers, and the ability to \n\u201creallocate, realign, and reprogram\u201d the budget as needed. Under this Act, the government plans \nto boost financial assistance to MSMEs though guarantees, direct lending at concessional rates, \nand equity injections. Initiatives to streamline corporate registration, together with the existing \n \n15 The Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Delivery of Government Services Act requires business registrations to be \nprocessed within 3 business days. \n16 No separate estimate is made regarding the time needed to navigate the CRS.  \n17 Quezon City has implemented a single-window one-stop registration process (glossary) and issues business permits \nrelatively quickly.  \n18 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 2018.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: inequality reduced, and the nation\u2019s growth \npotential increased by improving the business climate to encourage investments (footnote 4). The \nTA will have the following outcome: environment for business registration improved. The TA will \nhave two outputs: (i) CRS improved and (ii) capacity of CRS staff strengthened.22 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Corporate registration system improved. The TA will fund the replacement \nof the current CRS by procuring a modern, semi-custom-designed web-based system using \ncloud-based storage through a license agreement. Transitioning to licensed software will reduce \nthe SEC\u2019s need to dedicate internal resources to maintaining and upgrading the system and will \nprovide enhanced data security. The TA will also provide for reengineering of the registration \nprocess by removing unnecessary inputs and steps to ensure that the registration process can \nconsistently be completed within 3 days. The TA will increase the proportion of contactless \nregistrations, reducing the potential for corruption. As a result, the new CRS will lead to a modest \nreduction in the number of days required to register a business, thereby improving the Philippines\u2019 \nDoing Business ranking. \n \n10.  The new CRS will also serve as the anchor for the government\u2019s ongoing effort to address \nin  a  holistic  manner  the  broader  requirements  for  starting  a  business,  and  facilitate  the \nestablishment of a single-window one-stop business registration process (glossary) by linking to \nmultiple national government agencies. For example, the government plans to link the new CRS \nto the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Social Security System to enable the simultaneous \nissuance of a TIN and social security identification number. The new CRS will also be capable of \nfunctioning as a collateral registry, which could help improve the \u201cease of getting credit\u201d rating.23 \nAs the anchor of the single-window one-stop registration process, the new CRS will generate \neven more substantial efficiencies and further reduce the processing steps and time needed to \nstart a business.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Capacity of corporate registration system staff strengthened. CRS staff \nare key to ensuring the delivery of high-quality services to new businesses. According to Doing \nBusiness 2019, more than half of the economies that legally mandate training of registry staff also \ndefine a minimum frequency or duration of such training.24 Therefore, training of registry officers \nshould be provided during the installation of the new CRS and continue thereafter to ensure \nseamless succession of staff and expansion of the registry. Recognizing the importance of \ntraining, the TA will improve the capacity of the SEC\u2019s staff for registry operations, including the \nimplementation of any revised organizational and operational procedures. The TA will also \nsupport  the  development  of  a  recurring  registry  training  program  with  a  train-the-trainer \ncomponent. \n \n22 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n23 The Personal Property Security Act (Republic Act No. 11057) was approved on 24 July 2017. \n24 In the People\u2019s Republic of China and Romania, for example, mandatory training programs are held annually. \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, of which $1,750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \nstaff support, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Department of Finance will be the executing agency and the SEC will be the \nimplementing agency. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.25 The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction identifies several ineligible expenses: \n(i) purchase of vehicles; (ii) salaries for civil servants; (iii) foreign travel; (iv) scholarships or long \ninternships; (v) detailed engineering design; (vi) civil works or other related expenses; and  \n(vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment \nActivities List.26 The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2020\u2013December 2023 \nExecuting agency  Department of Finance \nImplementing agency  Securities and Exchange Commission \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nRegistry firm  QCBS (90:10)  $1,750,000 \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting will be utilized, but contracts will not be signed until \nfunding is confirmed and ADB has approved the TA. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Ownership of any on-site ancillary information technology equipment \narrangement upon TA completion  necessary to complete the migration to the new corporate registration \nsystem, such as computers and servers, will be turned over to the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission upon TA completion. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14.  Websites. The SEC currently operates its existing CRS via a website. After the completion \nof the TA, the SEC will continue to operate this website although the registry will run using licensed \nsoftware and cloud-based remote storage. The TA will cover 2 years of license and maintenance \nfees after which the SEC will budget for and pay these fees through the fees generated by the \ncorporate registration process. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  administering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$1,750,000 to the Government of the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction for Upgrading and Enhancing the Corporate Registration System, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.\n \n25 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n26 Except in the case of TA projects where the participation of recipient countries, including civil servants, in international \nworkshops, conferences, mentoring visits, or study tours is fully justified in the original proposal with detailed \ndescription, objectives, and budget, and approved by the Government of Japan.
