This regional technical assistance (RETA), which is consistent with the framework of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Pacific  Region  Environmental  Strategy  and  the  Pacific \nRegional  Operational  Business  Plan,  responds  to  key  concerns  regarding  management  of \ncoastal and marine resources as raised by five Pacific countries,1 which lie within or border the \ncoral triangle.2 This RETA will assist Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste in \nfulfilling Coral Triangle Initiative3 (CTI)-related objectives and in engaging with the Fiji Islands \nand Vanuatu in these efforts. A separate ADB RETA will assist Southeast Asian CTI countries in \nfulfilling CTI objectives.4 The five Pacific countries mentioned have demonstrated their interest \nin  cooperating  with  the  Global  Environment  Facility\u2014Pacific  Alliance  for  Sustainability  \n(GEF-PAS).5  Since  there  are  strong  complementarities  between  the  CTI  and  GEF-PAS \nobjectives and both are eligible for Global Environment Facility (GEF) cofinancing, this RETA \nhas  integrated  marine  protected  areas  management  with  efforts  to  control  damage  from \npollutants derived from onshore activities. In addition, given that the broader CTI and ADB \npartners such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, Secretariat of the Pacific Community, \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  and  WorldFish  Center  are  addressing \noffshore commercial fishing threats and related capacity and enforcement issues, this RETA will \nfocus on the challenges for inshore fisheries, marine managed areas, and land-based pollution \naffecting coastal waters.  \n2.  A draft CTI plan of action was discussed at the first CTI senior officials\u2019 meeting in \nDecember 2007, and the Fiji Islands and Vanuatu also endorsed a \u201cridge-to-reef\u201d GEF-PAS \nproposal to support greater attention to pollutants that flow from the land to the sea. ADB has \nbeen designated as the lead GEF agency in formulating the CTI, including for Pacific countries, \nand the GEF council has endorsed a broad proposal for action.6 All five countries have formally \nendorsed  this  proposed  structure,  and  the  need  for  the  RETA  was  reaffirmed  during  a  \nfact-finding mission held from 11 February to 7 March 2008.7 Two other Pacific developing \nmember countries, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau, will be \ninvolved in an information-sharing role in the RETA.8  \n                                                 \n1  These countries are Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu. Of these, \nPNG, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste are part of the core group of coral triangle countries, which also includes \nIndonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. \n2  The coral triangle is a global center of marine diversity covering 5.7 million square kilometers and including all or \npart of exclusive economic zones of six countries.  It contains vast marine resources critical for economic and food \nsecurity of an estimated 120 million people. \n3  The CTI was proposed by the President of Indonesia and supported by six core countries to increase coastal and \nmarine resources management action and to improve resource mobilization and regional cooperation to this end. \n4  TA 6446-REG: Strengthening Sound Environmental Management in the Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia \nand Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area. Approved in February 2008, the RETA will be implemented by \nSoutheast Asia Department of ADB.   \n5  GEF-PAS is a regional effort, increasing attention toward global environmental concerns that support national \ndevelopment priorities, in partnership with GEF and its agencies. ADB serves as one of 10 GEF agencies with \naccess to GEF financing for activities that support the achievement of global environmental objectives in areas \nsuch as climate change (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity conservation, and the management of international \nwaters. \n6  The CTI framework document, the Pacific Alliance for Sustainability framework document, and the GEF project \ninformation form, authorizing the preparation of this RETA for GEF cofinancing, were approved by the GEF council \nin April 2008. \n7  The RETA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 February 2008. \n8  A separate GEF-financed project under GEF-PAS will be implemented by the United Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP) and the Micronesia Challenge, and it will support similar and related activities in the Marshall \nIslands, Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.  \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The coral triangle is the most species-rich coastal and marine environment in the world, \nand its resources support the livelihoods of a significant proportion of the populations of the \ncountries in or adjacent to the coral triangle through products and services linked with fisheries, \necotourism, and other coastal economic activity. Production systems are largely based on these \nnatural resources. Growth must be sustainable to drastically reduce the incidence of poverty. \nFor many people involved in coastal and small-scale fisheries, marine resources are the only \nsource of cash income, with households living hand-to-mouth. Development without sustainable \nmanagement of coastal and marine resources risks exacerbating poverty. While stakeholders \nand contemporary research agree that the coral triangle area reefs are in generally good \ncondition, there are significant coastal development and fishing-related pressures including \noverexploitation of coastal areas and overharvesting of valuable species. Reef fish have been \nheavily  exploited  by  small-scale  commercial  enterprises,  local  fishing  communities,  and \ncommercial fishing. There are also indications of coastal and marine ecosystem damage due to \ndestructive fishing practices and sediment and effluent discharge from neighboring catchments. \nIn  addition,  weak  management  of  natural  resources  systems  in  Pacific  countries  risks \nprogressive degradation of the region\u2019s economic base, especially fish stocks. Predicted climate \nchange impacts, such as rising sea levels and temperature, will also likely degrade resources, \nresulting in economic disruption and social flow-on effects for the coral triangle countries. Goods \nand  services  provided  by  coastal  and  marine  ecosystems  include  rich  and  often  endemic \nbiological diversity, which in turn sustains complex livelihood systems and supports unique \ncultural practices with traditional customary practices relating to the management and use of \nthese resources.  \n \n4.  Many threats to biological resources in the coral triangle are regional in scope; therefore, \ncoral triangle countries would benefit from well-coordinated policy, institutional, and technical \nresponses at the national and regional levels. Areas for cooperation include those addressing (i) \ndestructive practices used in the live reef food fish trade; (ii) illegal, unregulated, and unreported \nfishing across the region; (iii) climate change impacts; and (iv) depletion of highly migratory \nmarine animals that cross national boundaries. A coordinated multilateral partnership among \ncoral triangle countries is also much more likely to attract significant public and private funding \nfrom external sources.  \n  \n5.  These countries are facing significant challenges when creating effective coastal and \nmarine resources management programs. Staff and budget resources are usually extremely \nlimited for governmental environment agencies. Efforts tend to be primarily focused on the \nproductive sectors\u2019 resources management, rather than on conservation. In addition, stronger \ncoordination and cooperation are needed among the many government agencies and levels \nresponsible for the environment and natural resources, as well as between government and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). While capacity limitations are notable across all five \ncountries, capacity needs in Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste are particularly high.  \n \n6.  Consultations with the donor community revealed that substantial international resources \nhave been invested in the Pacific to better manage the region\u2019s environment. However, the \nefforts are largely disparate and have sometimes not received the required ownership and \nsupport at the country-level, especially whole-of-government engagement. To succeed, coastal \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nand marine resources management assistance must be supported at the country level, with \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nstrong  engagement  from  coordinating  and  sectoral  agencies  alike,  as  well  as  local  level \ngovernment representatives. \n \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  This  RETA  will  complete  a  design  (phase  1)  for  a  follow-on  RETA  (phase  2)  to \nstrengthen management of coastal and marine resources in coral triangle countries at the local \nand national levels to prevent environmental degradation and to achieve both global and local \nbenefits  from  improved  environmental  management.  The  impact  of  both  RETAs  will  be \nenhanced and sustained Pacific coastal and marine systems. The outcome of this RETA (phase \n1) will be an agreed design of a 4-year coastal and marine resources management plan (phase \n2) to be implemented from 2010 to 2013.9 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n8.  This RETA will prepare a design for phase 2 within 9 months (September 2008 to May \n2009).  It  will  adopt  the  following  strategies:  (i) using  research-based  information  to  define \noptions and to make decisions for sustainable coastal and marine resources management; (ii) \nengaging multisector and multilevel stakeholder participation to ensure broad-based design \nownership  and  support;  (iii)  building  on  existing  strategies,  policies,  plans,  intercountry \nagreements, and institutional history to consolidate gains and accelerate progress; (iv) securing \nlong-term  commitments  from  stakeholders  and  development  partners  to  sustain  design \nimplementation results in a complex implementation setting; and (v) noting the interaction of \nfactors shaping common threats and opportunities for  environmental protection to generate a \ncoordinated response for the participating countries.10 Major assumptions and risks include the \navailability of country data and government and stakeholder capacity to participate in RETA \nactivities.  \n \n9.  The following activities will be carried out during design formulation:  \n \n(i)   Prepare  environmental  and  socioeconomic  profiles  of  participating \ncountries. The profiles will determine: (a) the environmental and socioeconomic \ncharacteristics of the individual countries and the coral triangle subregion; (b) \ncommon  environmental  issues  and  trends  and  the  impact  of  socioeconomic \nactivities  on  environmental  degradation;  (c)  gaps  in  information  and  data \nmanagement systems and methods; (d) watershed conditions and their interface \nwith marine and coastal habitats; (e) threats from land-based activities to coral \n                                                 \n9  Phase 2 activities will be in two areas: (i) marine areas management; and (ii) integrated watershed, coastal \nresources, and fisheries management. Climate change impacts on coastal and marine resources and adaptations \nto  these  risks  will  be  integrated  into  both  components.  Tailored  country-specific  implementation  and  \nwhole-of-government engagement and coordination in each country will be critical for RETA success.  \n10 The implementation of this RETA will build on and/or be closely coordinated with the following ADB projects, which \nhave been approved: (i) ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed Loan to Papua New Guinea for the Coastal Fisheries Management and Development Project (Loan 1925, \napproved 24 October, $5.7 million) and (ii) ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for Strengthening the Live Reef Fish \nTrade Management in the Pacific Developing Member Countries. Manila (RETA 5896, approved 28 December, \n$215,000).

The \nlegislation  and  policy  assessment  will  review  national  policies,  strategies, \nregulations, and laws, assessing the relevance and appropriateness of these \ninstruments to the major environmental issues and trends in the subregion as \ndefined  in  the  environmental  and  socioeconomic  profiles,  as  well  as  the \neffectiveness with which the policies and regulations are being implemented and \nenforced. Gaps in these instruments will be identified and recommendations \nmade.  The  planning  and  project  management  capacity  of  implementing \ngovernment agencies will be assessed, drawing on existing national capacity \nself-assessments. The results of the assessment will indicate capabilities and \nshortfalls and will be drawn upon for likely interventions under phase 2.  \n \n(iii)   Formulate a 4-year project design. The aim is to draw stakeholder inputs and \nsupport for the design, especially from government but also communities, NGOs, \nand the private sector. In consultation meetings, stakeholders\u2014led by the GEF \nfocal point and lead environment counterpart agency for the RETA and involving \nthe whole-of-government coordination mechanism in each country\u2014will identify \nissues,  define  sustainability  indicators  for  the  subregion,  and  propose  future \ncourses of action. The meetings will result in the following: (a) list of priority \nactions and associated cost estimates to be carried out at the country level, and \n(b) coordination and information sharing at the regional level, as appropriate. \n \n(iv)   Generate  government  support  and  forging  partnerships  for  action.  The \nproposed project design will be submitted for review to the participating countries\u2019 \ngovernments.  Their  representatives  and  ADB  will  consult  and  agree  on  any \nneeded design revisions or adjustments, and then the design will be circulated to \nthe CTI secretariat, development partners, Council of Regional Organisations in \nthe  Pacific  (CROP)  agencies,11 NGOs,  and  the  private  sector  for  their \nsuggestions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The RETA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,125,000: $550,000 of which will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Finland12 and $300,000 of which will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the GEF through a project preparation grant.13 The RETA will be \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  remaining  amount  of  $275,000  will  be  contributed  by  the \ngovernments of the five participating countries, and each country will finalize its contribution \nbefore RETA implementation. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \nAlthough the cost estimates and financing plan for the phase 2 RETA will be decided as an \n                                                 \n1T1 h Teh evsieew asg eenxcpieres sinsceludd hee trheei nF aorruem th Foisshee orife sth Aeg ceonncys,u Sltaecnrte atanrdia td oof  nthoet  Pneacciefisc sCaorimlym ruenpirtye,s Seonut tthh oPsaeci foicf  AApDpBlie\u2019sd  \nmGemeobsecriesn, cBeo Caordm omfi sDsiiroenc, tSoorsu,t hM Paancaifgice Rmeegniotn, aolr E sntvaifrfo, namnedn mt Paryo gbream pmreeli,m ainnda Uryn iivne nrsaittyu roef .t h e South Pacific. \n12 Through a channel financing agreement (Technical Assistance Program) between the Government of Finland and \nADB. \n13 Application for cofinancing ($300,000) for project preparation was made to the GEF on 10 June 2008 and approved \non 23 June 2008.  A Letter of Commitment for the funds was received on 7 July 2008. \n ", "  5\noutcome  of  this  RETA,  the  funding  envelope\u2014including  direct  and  parallel  cofinancing\u2014is \nexpected to be over $40 million.14  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department (PARD) will serve as the executing agency for the RETA. \nCounterpart implementing agencies will be the lead environment agencies in each of the five \nparticipating  countries.15  To  ensure  whole-of-government  engagement  and  coordination,  a \nsteering committee mechanism in each country, which will include the GEF focal point and the \nlead environmental agency, will be utilized.16 These committee mechanisms will consult with \ncivil society and the private sector to ensure various stakeholders\u2019 input. At the regional level, \nPARD and GEF will facilitate regional information sharing through CTI, GEF-PAS, and ADB \nprocesses.17 No-objection in writing will be obtained from each of the participating countries \nprior to commencing or financing activities under the RETA in the territory of such participating \ncountry. Links will also be formed with CTI focal points for the three core CTI countries (PNG, \nSolomon  Islands,  and  Timor-Leste).  Further  implementation  arrangement  details  in  each \ncountry can be found in the aide m\u00e9moire of the fact-finding mission. \n \n12.  The RETA will require international (18 person-months) and national (21 person-months) \nfacilitator services. Consultants will be recruited through a firm using quality- and cost-based \nselection (90:10) with a simplified technical proposal. Five national facilitators (one per country, \ninternational or national consultants) working closely with their respective GEF focal points will \nreport to the team leader, who in turn will report to a PARD staff consultant, all under the \nsupervision of the PARD governance specialist. International consultants will be selected and \nhired by ADB, and the national facilitators by ADB in consultation with participating governments, \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nOutline terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix 3, and a proposed organizational \nstructure for implementation is provided in Appendix 4. Upon RETA completion, all equipment \npurchased will be provided to the participating governments.  \n \n13.  Capacity needs and constraints in participating countries were discussed in detail with \nstakeholders during the fact-finding mission and documented in country-specific appendixes to \nthe aide-m\u00e9moire, which will be drawn upon by the consultant team. RETA consultations will \ninclude governments, the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat and CROP agencies, the Coral Reef \nInitiative for the South Pacific, and NGOs, as well as the private sector, which can play an \nimportant role with respect to promoting sustainable livelihoods. \n                                                 \n14 This will likely include a $7.5 million GEF grant, $1.5 million from ADB\u2019s technical assistance resources, and \ncofinancing provided on a grant basis as follows: Australia ($9 million); international NGOs, including Conservation \nInternational, The Nature Conservancy, and World Wide Fund for Nature ($6 million); United States ($20 million); \nJapan; and New Zealand (figures for Japan and New Zealand will be released in the 2nd half of 2008).  \n15 Fiji Islands = Department of Environment; PNG = Department of Environment and Conservation; Solomon Islands \n=  Department  of  Environment,  Conservation  and  Meteorology;  Timor-Leste  =  Directorate  of  International \nEnvironmental Affairs; Vanuatu = Ministry of Lands (Environment Unit)   \n16 Fiji Islands = Sustainable Development Committee; PNG = MDG7 Technical Committee (to be renamed Climate \nChange and Environmental Sustainability Technical Committee); Solomon Islands = Coordination Committee for \nSustainable Development;  Timor-Leste = Interministerial Working Group on Environmental Coordination, Natural \nResource Management, and Multilateral Environmental Agreements; Vanuatu = Vanuatu Scientific Research \nThCeo uvniecwil s expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n1m7 Aem pbroepross, eBdo Saordu tohfe aDsitr eAcstioar sD, eMpaarntmagenetm-aednmt,in oisrt esrteadff ,R aEnTdA m, Caoyo bpee rpartieolnim ainnda rKy ninow nleadtugree .S  haring for the Coral \nTriangle Initiative, is expected to facilitate information exchange from this PARD RETA across the wider CTI effort. \nThe GEF International Waters Learning Exchange and Resource Network will facilitate information sharing and \naccess to best practices from over 60 related GEF projects around the world, enabling Pacific partners to benefit \nfrom global experience. \n ", "6   \n \nIV.
