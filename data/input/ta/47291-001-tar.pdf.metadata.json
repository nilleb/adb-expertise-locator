INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional capacity development technical assistance (TA)1 aims to empower four \nsupreme audit institutions (SAIs) of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): (i) the \nAudit Board (BPK)2 of Indonesia, (ii) the Commission on Audit (COA) of the Philippines, (iii) the \nOffice of Auditor General (OAG) of Myanmar, and (iv) the State Audit Organization (SAO) of the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).3 The TA aims to improve the capacity of selected \nSAIs  in  financial  audits  that  comply  with  the  International  Standards  of  Supreme  Audit \nInstitutions (ISSAI) thus developing country systems. The ASEAN governments requested the \nTA in a dialogue between the ASEAN supreme audit institutions (ASEANSAI), BPK, COA, OAG, \nSAO, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at the end of 2013.4 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  for  good \ngovernance.  The  SAIs  are  the  countries\u2019  lead  public  sector  audit  institutions,  having  the \nprincipal task of examining whether public funds\u2014including loan and grant projects funded by \ndevelopment partners\u2014are spent economically, efficiently, and effectively in compliance with \nexisting rules and regulations. Well-functioning SAIs can play an important role in confirming \nthat  controls  are  operating  effectively,  identifying  waste,  and  suggesting  ways  in  which \ngovernment organizations can operate better. By ensuring that public money is well spent, they \ncan contribute to national development and the fight to reduce poverty. The reality is that SAIs \nin many developing member countries (DMCs) are not functioning as they should. In some \ncases, SAIs lack authority, skills, and resources to carry out proper and thorough audits and to \nreport the results freely and without fear. Consequently, the quality of many audit reports in \nDMCs is not good, and most reports do not fully comply with the ISSAI.   \n \n3.   ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (PCP) 2011 expands the scope of information \nreleased  to  the  public  and  speed  of  dissemination  so  as  to  increase  transparency  and \naccountability.5 It is harmonized with the disclosure policies of other development partners. \nAccording to the PCP 2011, audited annual project financial statements (APFSs) for sovereign \n(loan and grant) projects financed by and through ADB will be posted on ADB\u2019s website.6 ADB \nand the DMC governments may face potential reputational risks since the quality of the audited \nAPFSs needs significant improvement. The key findings of ADB\u2019s Audit Report 2012 revealed \nthat  (i) only about 15% of APFSs  were presented in strict conformity with the ISSAI,  (ii) only \n21% of APFSs complied with ADB\u2019s audit requirements, (iii) only about 57% of APFSs and \naudited entity financial statements were submitted on time, and (iv) about 77% of projects \nincluded management letters but only 32% covered substantial issues. 7 Enhancing the roles of \nSAIs in compliance with the ISSAI may reduce various risks for the governments as well as \ndevelopment partners.  \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 November 2014. A fact-finding \nmission was held intermittently from 1 October to 4 November 2014. \n2   Badan Pengawas Keuangan dan Pembangunan (Indonesia\u2019s supreme audit institution). \n3  The country selection process is explained in para. 7.  \n4  The TA\u2019s concept clearance was approved on 9 June 2014, and the Government of Japan approved the TA to be \nfunded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction on 27 August 2014. It is expected that the TA will be approved by \nADB Management by the end of 2014 and implementation will start by January 2015. \n5  The policy was approved on 25 October 2011 and became effective on 2 April 2012. \n6  This will apply to projects for which the invitation to negotiate was issued by ADB on or after 2 April 2012. \n7  ADB. 2012. Audit Report: Loan and Grant Administration. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \n4.  ASEANSAI  was  established  in  November  2011  as  an  autonomous,  independent, \nprofessional, and nonpolitical organization to enhance the roles of its 10 members to promote \ngood governance. It requested ADB and other development partners to support it in properly \nimplementing its mandate and strengthen the organizational and audit capacity of its members, \nespecially to implement the following programs: (i) developing audit manuals, guidance, and \ntools for its members; (ii) accelerating among its members the adoption of the ISSAI; and (iii) \ncapacity building support to its members.  ASEAN has been working with ADB in various \nsectors, and a memorandum of understanding between ADB and the ASEAN Secretariat was \nsigned in 2006 and updated in 2012. The TA will complement regional cooperation in 10 \nASEAN  countries  that  has  been  centering  around  three  main  pillars:  pro-poor  sustainable \neconomic growth, inclusive social development, and good governance for effective policies and \ninstitutions. The TA will support ASEAN integration by deepening technical and development \ncooperation to allow ASEAN member countries to move forward in a unified manner.8 \n \n5.  According to the mandate of SAIs, projects funded by development partners shall be \naudited by SAIs, but this is not the case for all ASEANSAI members. This is mainly due to low \ncapacity and political support. In Cambodia and Viet Nam, for example, audits of projects \nfunded  by  development  partners  are  performed  by  private  sector  auditors.  These  private \nauditors are not supervised by and/or accountable to the SAIs. Supported by ongoing ADB loan \nand grant,9 the SAI in Cambodia is preparing the subdecree on Implementing the Law on Audit \nof  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia.  The  subdecree  will  include  hiring  external  resources  to \ncomplement the SAI\u2019s capacity. Following its approval, the subdecree will still require detailed \nguidelines, training, public dissemination, and other support for its proper implementation. The \nWorld Bank has been working with the Supreme Audit of Viet Nam to allow it to audit several \nprojects funded by the World Bank on a pilot basis. \n \n6.  In Indonesia, projects funded by development partners approved up to 2008 are still \naudited  by  BPK.  Following  ongoing  reforms  in  promoting good governance, the  BPK  was \nrecently mandated to audit projects funded by development partners. As of December 2013, \nonly four out of 22 ongoing ADB projects were audited by the BPK, as were a very limited \nnumber of other development partner projects. This SAI needs support to carry out its new \nmandate properly. ADB does not have ongoing projects in Brunei Darussalam and Singapore, \nwhile investments in Malaysia and Thailand are limited.        \n \n7.  The BPK, COA, OAG, and SAO are selected as the participating SAIs with the following \njustification: (i) they audit most public funds and need further support to fully comply with the \nISSAI;10 (ii) for OAG, development partners have only recently re-entered the country and there \nis a need to improve the external audit capacity; and (iii) the TA will complement the previous \nADB investment for the SAO.11 However, the SAO has expressed its need to prepare detailed \nguidelines to hire external resources to meet its obligations to deliver good quality audit reports \non time and to enhance staff capacity. In addition, BPK is the ASEANSAI permanent secretariat \nand in a position to monitor progress of all ASEANSAI members. Furthermore, COA is the lead \nfor the ISSAI knowledge-sharing committee, and will help disseminate TA outputs. Through this \nTA, SAIs will share their progress, and this may encourage all SAIs to further improve their \ncapacity.  \n                                                \n8  ASEAN. 2008.

The TA will work closely with ASEANSAI to disseminate the lessons from the four \nselected SAIs to its other members, especially to SAIs in Cambodia and Viet Nam. Based on \nlessons among SAIs, the TA will assist ASEANSAI to explore other investments to enable other \nSAIs to move towards full application of the ISSAI and improve the quality of public finance \naudits in ASEAN. \n \n9.  Lessons from other investments. From the mid-1980s to 2002, ADB approved 42 TA \ngrants totaling $22 million for developing audit capacity to promote good governance in Asia \nand the Pacific.12 Although progress has been made, ongoing support is needed and being \nprovided.13 The following are some of the lessons from all these TAs: (i) requirements for \nregional training programs need to be thoroughly investigated to ensure that programs do not \noffer techniques or processes that cannot be applied by DMCs and the cost estimates cover the \nentire programs and not just the part supported by ADB; (ii) there is compatibility between the \nInternational Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions Development Initiatives and ADB for \naudit development; (iii) that the SAI mandate should go beyond financial and compliance audits \nis not explicit for all DMCs; their audit laws and regulations may be amended to expand the \nscope of auditing to cover environment, performance, system, special investigation, and state-\nowned enterprises; (iv)  weak accounting and the lack of effective follow-up after auditing \nundermine the effectiveness of the overall audit process; and (v) more compelling justification \nfor commercialization of audit responsibilities is needed. \n \n10.  To strengthen the SAIs, the TA will (i) adopt a more comprehensive assessment for \naddressing  audit  weaknesses,  including  coordination  with  other  development  partners;  (ii) \nsupport training programs to strengthen audit effectiveness; (iii) ensure closer coordination \nbetween  SAIs  and  ADB  departments;  (iv)  improve  accounting  and  reporting  to  ensure \naccountability, timely availability of audit reports, and effective governance; and (v) explore \npotential roles of SAIs in the audit process to cover performance audit and special investigations \nto generate net public expenditure savings, and ensure proper use of funds.  \n \n11.  Collaboration  with  other  development  partners.  Enhancing  partnership  with \ndevelopment partners is one of the ASEANSAI\u2019s strategic plan objectives. German development \ncooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) has long-\nterm commitment and allocated about $20 million (for a 10-year program) to help ASEANSAI \nimplement the prioritized activities such as funded studies on ISSAI compliance on financial, \nperformance, and compliance audit. The studies are expected to be completed by late 2014.14 \nTo complement GIZ\u2019s assistance, the TA will focus its investments on improving financial audit \nstandards in selected SAIs based on the GIZ initial findings. GIZ also indicated its commitment \nto support similar activities for Cambodia and Viet Nam since both countries are not included in \nthe TA. The World Bank is considering another TA to complement the efforts of ADB and GIZ, \nsuch  as  with  the  COA.  Like  ADB,  the World  Bank\u2019s  investment  activities  are  focused  on \nselected  DMCs.  The  coordination  between  GIZ,  the  World  Bank,  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA),  ADB,  and  other  development  partners  is  conducted  through \nASEANSAI, as well as through country-specific issues. The ASEANSAI proposed that ADB \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance Performance Audit Report on Strengthening Audit Capacity.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be financial audits by the ASEANSAI members conducted in accordance \nwith ISSAI. The outcome will be the quality of financial audit guidelines of the selected SAIs \nimproved to ISSAI level. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Assessment of existing guidelines and capacity of selected supreme \naudit institutions completed. The output key indicators are (i) identified ISSAI compliance on \nfinancial audit in four selected SAIs, and (ii) completed action plans of four SAIs to implement \nthe ISSAI. Findings from the GIZ-funded assessment on ISSAI compliance will be used as the \nbaseline data and the TA will enhance SAI capacity to comply with the ISSAI. The assessment \nwill include capacities on financial management, procurement, financial auditing, outsourcing \nresources,  and  training  needs.  Under  the  TA  a  regional  workshop  will  be  conducted  to \ndisseminate findings, recommendations, and plans of action. SAIs from other ASEAN countries \nwill be invited, together with GIZ, JICA, the World Bank, and other development partners, to \nparticipate  in  the  workshops  to  disseminate  the  guidelines  and  to  gather  inputs  from \nstakeholders so as to finalize the action plan of each participating SAI to implement the TA. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Country  guidelines  on  international  standards  of  supreme  audit \ninstitutions financial audits piloted and updated. Key indicators of this output are that (i) \nISSAI-based guidelines on financial audit of four selected SAIs are updated, (ii) staff of four \nSAIs are trained in implementing the guidelines, (iii) financial audit guidelines are field tested, \nand (iv) results of the field test are presented in a workshop and shared with other SAIs in \nASEAN. For these targets, the compliance of financial audit guidelines with the ISSAI will be \nimproved, including guidelines for outsourcing resources. The guidelines will include manuals, \naudit tools, and other support to comply with the ISSAI on financial audit. The TA will assist in \npreparing training modules to implement ISSAI-based guidelines and field test the guidelines in \nselected projects. In addition to regular projects, one or two emergency projects will be included \nin the field tests to find out whether a specific audit manual is required for such projects. A round \ntable discussion to compare results in the four countries will also be held. The TA will also assist \nASEANSAI to develop a scorecard to assess the compliance of its members with the ISSAI. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Country  guidelines  on  international  standards  on  financial  audits \ndisseminated to other ASEANSAI members. Key indicators of this output are that (i) the new \nimproved guidelines are disseminated to other ASEANSAI members; and (ii) an exit strategy, \nincluding road maps, is completed. Under the TA, a regional workshop will be conducted to \ndisseminate  lessons  from  the  four  selected  countries  to  other  ASEANSAI  members. \nDevelopment partners will be invited to share the results and confirm funding inputs to prepare \nroad maps to roll out the results. The road maps will be the exit strategy and will be the basis for \nASEANSAI and its members to roll out the lessons to fully comply with the ISSAI. Following the \ncompletion of the road maps, it is expected that ASEANSAI will roll out the new guidelines with \nlessons from the pilot SAIs to the remaining ASEANSAI members, and each SAI will explore \nvarious  sources  to  implement  its  road  map.  The  SAIs  may  secure  funding  from  other \n ", "5 \n \ndevelopment partners as well as from internal government sources to scale up the investments \nto other public funds and/or to other countries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  as  the  executing  agency.  As  discussed  with  the  four \ngovernments,  the  TA  will  establish  a  working  group  in  each  selected  SAI,  which  will  be \nsupported by consultants, to implement the activities set out in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). Both SAI staff and consultants will work closely with ADB headquarters \nin Manila; resident missions in Indonesia, the Lao PDR, and Myanmar; and the Philippines \nCountry Office. ADB will also work with other government agencies, development partners, and \nstakeholders to intensify the knowledge sharing among ASEANSAI members. All disbursements \nunder the TA will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will support the working groups in \nrecruiting the consultants,15 purchasing equipment, and in managing other expenses funded by \nADB. All equipment and assets purchased under the TA will be turned over to the related SAIs \nupon TA completion. Procurement, if any, will follow ADB Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time). \n  \n18.  ADB officers will work closely with staff of the Office of Anticorruption and Integrity and \nthe  Operations  Services  and  Financial  Management  Department,  as  well  as  financial \nmanagement focal points in participating countries. ADB staff may act as resource persons to \nprovide technical and management support for the TA. The TA will recruit one international \nconsultant  (10  person-months)  and  four  national  consultants  (total  32  person-months)  as \nindividuals  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended time to time). Under supervision of a working group in each SAI, the consultants will \nwork closely to support TA implementation. The terms of reference for the consultants are given \nin Appendix 3. \n \n19.  ASEANSAI, BPK, COA, OAG, and SAO will provide counterpart support in the form of \noffice space, supporting staff, and other in-kind contributions to implement TA-related activities. \nFor their participation as resource persons in knowledge sharing during workshops and other \nconsultations, travel costs of SAI staff from other ASEANSAI members will be funded by the TA. \nThe TA will be implemented over 2 years, from January 2015 to January 2017. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Enhancing Roles of Supreme Audit \nInstitutions in Selected Association of Southeast Asian Nations Countries, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                \n15  To reduce administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money, all consulting services \nunder the TA will be engaged under output-based (lump-sum) contracts. \n ", "6     Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and  \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \n \nImpact  By 2020:   Assumptions \n \n \nFinancial audits by  Enhanced by 20% of ISSAI  Annual progress reports  Close coordination among \nthe ASEANSAI  compliance on financial  and websites of  members through \nmembers   audit conducted by  ASEANSAI and its  ASEANSAI \nconducted in  ASEANSAI members   members  \naccordance with  Baseline (2014): TBD    Adequate funds to reform \nISSAI  (scale of 0\u2013100%)    SAIs in adopting ISSAI  \nReports of BPK, COA, \n  Reduced by 10% qualified  OAG, and SAO   Risk \nopinion on financial audits  Conflicting interpretation \nof public funds audited by  and implementation of laws \nASEANSAI members  in DMCs may affect \nBaseline (2014) = TBD  progress toward \ncompliance with ISSAI \n   \nOutcome  Assumption \nBy 2016:  \nWebsites of ASEANSAI \nThe quality of  Four SAIs have adopted  The willingness of SAIs to \nand its members  \nfinancial audit  the guidelines on  share and accept the \n \nguidelines of the  implementing ISSAI  lessons from other \n \nselected SAIs  financial audit   members to improve their \nimproved to ISSAI  Baseline (2014) = 2    capacity  \nlevel     \n \nASEANSAI regularly used a  TA Progress reports, \nscorecard for assessing  ASEANSAI, and related   \nISSAI compliance  SAIs  \nBaseline (2014) = 0 \n \nOutputs   By 2016    Assumptions \n \n1.
