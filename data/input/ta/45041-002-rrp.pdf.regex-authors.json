THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the OPEC Fund for International \nDevelopment (OFID), and (iii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Global \nEnvironment Facility, all to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Vientiane \nSustainable Urban Transport Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve the quality of life in Vientiane by improving access and mobility. \nThe project will do this by establishing a sustainable urban transport management agency \n(SUTMA), a high-quality public bus transport system, a parking management system, and a \nnational  electronic  vehicle  registration  system,  and  by  improving  traffic  management  and \naccessibility for pedestrians and nonmotorized transport (NMT). The project promotes gender \nmainstreaming, greenhouse gas reduction, and public\u2013private partnership. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Vientiane, the capital of the Lao PDR has an estimated population of about 750,000. The \nprincipal urbanized areas have an estimated population of 500,000. The central core of the city \nhas a mixture of government, educational, religious, and commercial institutions, as well as \nresidential areas, and is also the tourism center, with many hotels and historical and cultural \nattractions.2 Many of the roads in Vientiane are narrow, and many of the intersections operate in \nan inefficient manner. The total number of private vehicles registered in Vientiane increased at \nan average annual growth rate of 17% during 2000\u20132009, and has increased at a growth rate of \nmore than 10% since then, placing Vientiane on an unsustainable transport development path, \nas the city is starting to experience congestion, increased incidence of road accidents, and \ndeteriorating  local  air  quality.  The  expanding  use  of  private  vehicles  is  also  increasing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Motorcycles are the primary mode of transport, accounting for \n67.0% of daily trips, while public transport only accounts for an estimated 0.6% of daily trips.3 \nPublic transport in Vientiane is largely provided by privately operated vehicles, particularly tuk-\ntuks  (motorized  tricycles).  While  Vientiane  Capital  State  Bus  Company  (VCSBC)  provides \nservice from the central bus station in the core area to other points in Vientiane, there is no bus \nservice  linking  points  within  the  core  area.  VCSBC  lacks  (i)  staff  with  sufficient  skills,  (ii) \ncompetition,  (iii)  incentives  to  improve  efficiency,  and  (iv)  capital.  There  is  no  parking \nmanagement system in Vientiane, with no charge for on-street parking and little enforcement of \nparking regulations. \n \n4.  The  project  supports  the  objectives  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  sustainable  development \nstrategies, including the Strategic Framework for National Sustainable Development Strategy \nand the National Rio+20 Report.4 The National Rio+20 Report specifies the government\u2019s long-\nterm sustainable transport strategy and action plan. The project will support achievement of a \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The core area comprises about a 1.6 square km section located along a 2.5 km stretch of the Mekong river. \n3  ADB. 2011.

The project supports the strategic priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \n2014\u20132020 stipulated in ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 by improving the enabling \nenvironment  for  inclusive  growth  through  capacity  building,  increasing  assistance  for \nsustainable transport, mobilizing private sector investment, facilitating access to global and \nregional funds, and contributing to ADB\u2019s cofinancing target. 5 The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for the Lao PDR, which has as its overarching \nobjective inclusive and sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, with a focus on \nimproved urban services to meet the challenges of the rapid urbanization agenda.6 The project \nis supported by ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative and is included in ADB\u2019s Lao PDR \nTransport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map.7 \n \n6.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  other  public  transport  projects  and \ninnovations  in  public  transport. 8  The  Lanzhou  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Project \ndemonstrated the benefits of innovations in BRT design and development, including the use of \ndirect services, flexible station layout, and NMT integration.  9 ADB\u2019s experience in capacity \nbuilding  in  public  transport  through  provision  of  BRT  training  courses  will  facilitate  the \nestablishment of SUTMA. ADB\u2019s participation in the preparation of the updated BRT Planning \nGuide will facilitate the use of best practices in developing the BRT system in Vientiane. 10 \n \n7.  The project has a number of special features. Cofinancing will be provided from five \nsources  through  loans,  grants,  and  private-sector  investment.  The  parking  and  vehicle \nregistration systems will be financed and operated by the private sector; while operations of the \nbuses, fare system and control center, and other functions will be tendered out to private service \nproviders. The project will utilize advanced technology and innovative practices, particularly for \nthe BRT system, traffic control center, and parking and vehicle registration system. The project \nwill reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  an  environmentally  sustainable  and  pedestrian-friendly \ntransport system developed in Vientiane. The project outcome will be improved urban transport \noperations and capacity in Vientiane. \n  \nC.  Outputs \n9.  Output 1: A sustainable transport management agency for Vientiane established. \nThe agency will manage operations of systems and facilities to be developed under the project \nas well as other sustainable transport operations in the future. Its primary functions will be (i) \nmanaging  the  private  sector  firms  providing  services  for  BRT  operations,  the  parking  and \nvehicle  registration  system,  and  system  management  functions;  (ii)  ensuring  that  services \nprovided are of high quality; (iii) managing daily operations of the public transport system; (iv) \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2014.

Output  2:  High-quality  bus  services  and  bus  rapid  transit  established  and \noperating in Vientiane. The project will develop 11.5 kilometers (km) of BRT corridors in the \ncenter of Vientiane dedicated to BRT services and NMT, including 24 enclosed stations, which \nwill be serviced by 96 new BRT buses meeting a minimum Euro IV emissions standard, which \nencompasses use of cleaner fuel and advanced propulsion and exhaust system technology. \nThe new BRT buses will serve a network of 84.0 km of routes covering much of the city. \nOperation of the BRT buses will be tendered out to private operators. The project will also \nestablish a state-of-the-art BRT and traffic management control center and an electronic fare \nsystem with pre-board fare collection. The new public transport system will be fully integrated \nwith the existing services of VCSBC in order to maximize the coverage of the network. VCSBC\u2019s \nexisting buses, most of which were financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nwill continue to operate. The combined network, to be served by BRT and VCSBC buses, will \nhave a total length of 137.5 km. \n \n11.  Output 3: Traffic management in the core area of Vientiane improved. The project \nwill introduce measures to improve traffic management so that traffic moves more efficiently in \nthe core area of Vientiane. These will include installing or upgrading traffic signals at 21 key \nintersections,  providing  new  road  markings  and  signage,  and  establishing  a  central  traffic \ncontrol center (joint control center with the BRT system [para. 10]) using the latest technology. \n \n12.  Output  4:  Paid  parking  system  and  national  vehicle  registration  system \nestablished. A new on-street paid parking system for Vientiane\u2019s core area will be established \nthat uses electronic meter technology. The new parking system will provide 2,100 on-street \nparking spaces for cars and 1,800 spaces for motorcycles. Also, a national electronic vehicle \nregistration system will be established that facilitates enforcement of parking regulations. Both \nthe parking and electronic vehicle registration systems will be implemented by private firms. \n \n13.  Output 5: Accessibility for pedestrians and other nonmotorized transport in the \ncore  area  of  Vientiane  improved. The project will improve pedestrian facilities near BRT \nstation areas by installing signalized pedestrian crossings, street lighting, pavement upgrades, \nand universal accessibility measures. In addition, the project will finance capacity building for \ntuk-tuk drivers and demonstration of modern electric-assist vehicles as a possible replacement \nfor existing highly polluting vehicles. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The executing agency for implementation of the project will be the Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport (MPWT). A steering committee to be chaired by a vice minister of the \nMPWT will be established and will comprise officials from the MPWT, Vientiane mayor\u2019s office, \n                                                 \n11 ADB and ADB-administered funds may finance local transport and insurance costs related to project expenditures. \n ", "5 \nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and Ministry of Planning \nand Investment. A project coordination unit (PCU) will be established in MPWT\u2019s Department of \nTransport to implement the project. The PCU director and some PCU staff will be from the \nDepartment of Transport, with other staff coming from the mayor\u2019s office. A new SUTMA will be \nestablished to manage operations of systems and facilities to be developed under the project. \nThe SUTMA will focus exclusively on transport in Vientiane to ensure that it is given sufficient \npriority. The primary functions of the SUTMA will be management, quality assurance, future \ndevelopment, and public communications (para. 9). It is expected that the entity will manage \nabout $17 million of revenue per year, primarily from the bus services and parking system. \nDiscussions among key stakeholders on the optimal organizational structure of the SUTMA and \ninstitutional location began during project preparation. The discussions will continue during \nproject implementation and will be facilitated by project-financed consultants. The project will \nprovide an advisor to the SUTMA and financial support during its first 2 years of operation. \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.12 Physical completion of the project will be by 30 June 2020, \nand all loans and grants will close by 31 December 2020. A maintenance period to cover the \nfinal 3 years of the 5-year maintenance period included in the contracts for the buses, fare \nsystem, control center equipment, and BRT stations will extend to 30 September 2023. All \nexpenses during the maintenance period will be financed by the government.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n18.  The project\u2019s technical viability has been confirmed through the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  and  other  supporting  TA  projects  (footnote  3).  The  institutional \nstructure of the SUTMA, which will operate the public transport system, is based on successful \nBRT and sustainable transport models currently in operation. The quality of the system will be \nenhanced by maximizing the use of private sector contracts for system operations, which will be \noverseen  by  SUTMA.  The  BRT  system  planning  utilized  global  positioning  system-based \nmapping, analysis of existing services to determine current demand, surveys and inventory of \nexisting services to determine current service capacity, and surveys of the proposed BRT \ncorridor. Based on the results, an optimized routing and network plan was developed. Ridership \nwill comprise more than 11,000 passenger boardings during the peak hour. \n \n19.  For the traffic management component, detailed analysis of traffic conditions was carried \nout that included traffic counts, surveys, and traffic signal efficiency analysis. As a result of this \nanalysis,  the  component  will  include  new  traffic  signalization  for  several  uncontrolled \nintersections, upgrading of other signals, and the creation of a new centralized traffic control \ncenter. The design of the parking system is based on multiple parking surveys in the core area \nof the city and a full analysis of parking supply and demand, including the duration of parking. \nThe use of electronic metering technology in conjunction with the parking tariff system will \nensure parking efficiency and optimization of resources. To improve accessibility for pedestrians \nand other NMT, pedestrian movements in the core area were analyzed. The project will focus \non access points to the BRT stations as well as pedestrian safety priorities. The improvement of \noperating  conditions  and  profitability  for  existing  tuk-tuk  operators  has  also  been  targeted \nthrough provision of modern vehicles and customer service training. \n \n20.  Public\u2013private  partnership  structures  will  be  utilized  extensively  to  maximize  the \nleveraging of additional financial resources and to improve the quality of the services delivered. \nOverall quality control and system management will be the responsibility of the SUTMA, which \nwill manage private sector contracts awarded to the bus operating company, the fare system \nand control center company, a financial clearinghouse company, and a quality control company \nthat  will  perform  monitoring  and  evaluation  responsibilities.  In  addition,  a  public\u2013private \npartnership model for the parking management, parking enforcement, and electronic vehicle \nregistration components will directly finance those components. The project implementation \nconsultants will assist in the design of the public\u2013private partnership structures. This model of \npublic sector management and private sector service delivery has been proven as a best \npractice model for the leading BRT and parking management systems worldwide.14 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic. Four main benefits were identified and estimated for inclusion in the project\u2019s \neconomic viability assessment: (i) reduced vehicle operating costs except those related to the \nparking  component;  (ii)  reduced  travel,  waiting,  and  walking  time  for  bus  passengers;  (iii) \nreduced costs of injuries and fatalities due to improved road safety; and (iv) reduced time spent \nsearching for parking places and associated reduced vehicle operating costs. The assessment \ncovered 6 years of project implementation and 20 years of operations.

Manila. \n ", "7 \nrate of return is 17.0%, and the net present value (discounting at 12.0%) is $27.23 million. \nSensitivity analysis shows that the economic internal rate of return is 13.9% in the case of total \nbenefits being reduced by 20.0%, and 14.5% in the case of total costs being increased by \n20.0%. The combined effect of the benefit reduction of 15.0% and the cost increase 15.0% \nleaves the economic internal rate of return at 12.9%, which is still above the threshold rate.15 \n \n22.  Financial. The project is financially sustainable, but will require a capital subsidy for \nreplacement of the buses and operating systems and a temporary operating subsidy. To assess \nthe financial sustainability, financial statements covering 15 years following project completion \nwere prepared. Recurrent annual and periodic project ongoing costs, which comprise those of \nthe BRT and NMT subprojects and the SUTMA operation and staff costs, and revenues from \nthe bus system and the parking subproject concession fee were estimated.16 An analysis was \nconducted to determine the extent to which bus fare revenue covers the bus system operating \ncost under alternative scenarios of (i) the current fare, (ii) the revenue-maximizing fare, and (iii) \na higher fare level. For reasons of elasticity of demand, increasing the fare to maximize revenue \nresulted in little improvement in cost recovery and a significant reduction in passengers, while a \nhigher fare lost more passengers and worsened cost recovery. Utilizing the current bus fare in \nthe projected financial statements, the public transport system will require (i) a capital grant to \nmeet the full replacement costs of the BRT buses, fare system, and combined BRT and traffic \ncontrol systems, and (ii) a temporary operating subsidy of an expected total of $3.7 million \nequivalent during the first 4 years of operations. These will not be provided under the project. \nThe government has agreed, through a loan covenant, to ensure that the SUTMA has all \nnecessary resources to operate the bus system effectively. The combined bus fare and parking \nconcession revenue equaled or exceed the BRT subproject operating cost except during 2021-\n2022. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  Assessments of the MPWT\u2019s financial management and procurement capacity and of \nthe  PCU  confirmed  that  project  implementation  arrangements,  which  follow  previous  ADB \ntransport sector projects in the Lao PDR, are appropriate. The risk ratings of the project\u2019s \nfinancial management arrangements are substantial for overall inherent risk and moderate for \noverall control risk. The executing agency, the MPWT, has extensive experience in managing \nADB-funded  and  other  externally  funded  projects  and  has  sufficient  capacity  to  undertake \ninternational and national competitive bidding for civil works packages. The MPWT will use a \nproject financial management system, including internal control procedures currently being used \nfor ADB-financed road projects. A grievance redress mechanism will be established for the \nproject, following the successful examples of ADB-financed road projects in the Lao PDR.17 \nShort-term assistance will be provided for strengthening the capacity of the executing and \nimplementing agencies and PCU in governance and public financial management through a \n$200,000 subcomponent of an ADB regional TA.18 A private firm will be hired for external \nauditing of the project accounts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, including the MPWT and the mayor\u2019s office. \n                                                 \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n16 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2007.

A draft stakeholder communication strategy utilizing a full range of communication and \nmarketing approaches to raise public awareness of the project and its benefits, and encourage \nthe widespread use of the BRT system, has been prepared.19 Under the strategy, additional \nconsultations will be conducted with key stakeholders, particularly the poor and other vulnerable \ngroups, to ensure their meaningful participation in the project. \n \n25.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The key gender issues \naddressed  by  the  project  include  appropriate  physical  design  that  meets  women\u2019s  needs, \naffordability, safety, and security of female passengers to promote greater use of the BRT by \nwomen. The project also provides an opportunity to change the traditional gender composition \nof the transport workforce by promoting women\u2019s employment in the BRT system and providing \ntraining. The project\u2019s gender action plan ensures that (i) 30% of employees of SUTMA will be \nwomen; (ii) the BRT system includes gender-specific design features such as priority seating for \nwomen and the elderly, adequate lighting, and security cameras in bus stations; (iii) 30% of jobs \ngenerated  in  the  BRT  system  are  filled  by  women;  (iv)  ticketing  and  fare  pricing  include \nmeasures to increase affordability and access; (v) pedestrian-friendly traffic management and \ntraffic calming measures are implemented on the BRT routes; (vi) baseline sex-disaggregated \ndata and gender analytical information are collected for preparatory surveys, feasibility studies, \nand assessments prior to the start of construction; and (vii) gender indicators are included in the \nproject monitoring and evaluation system, and disaggregated data are reported.20 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n1.  Environment \n26.  The project is category B for environment, and an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nhas been prepared based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).21 The IEE has been \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The project does not involve major civil works. Adverse impacts \nsuch as elevated noise levels, dust emissions, traffic disturbances, and other construction-\nrelated impacts will be experienced in the vicinity of the project sites. These impacts, however, \nare  considered  minor,  being  short  term  and  localized  in  nature.  The  parking  and  traffic \nmanagement  systems  will  involve  works  of  a  minor  nature  with  negligible  environmental \nimpacts. During operation, the overall environmental impact of the project will be beneficial. The \nproject will contribute to reduced traffic congestion, improved conditions for walking and cycling, \nimproved  community  livability,  and  better  air  quality.  The  project  will  reduce  emissions  of \ngreenhouse  gases  by  shifting  transport  demand  from  private  vehicles  to  buses.  Potential \nadverse  impacts  from  operation  of  the  bus  depot  and  bus  staging  areas  are  considered \ninsignificant  and  can  be  addressed  through  good  design  and  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures specified in the environmental management plan (EMP) included in the IEE.22 The \nEMP  includes  environmental  mitigation  measures  for  all  project  phases,  and  monitoring \nrequirements and responsibilities for EMP implementation. The EMP will be incorporated in the \n                                                 \n19 Draft Stakeholder Communication Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Such impacts pertain to noise, vehicle emissions, wastewater from washing, waste oil from maintenance works, \nleaks and spills of hazardous substances, traffic congestion due to entry and exit of buses, and safety concerns. \n ", "9 \ncivil works contract documents. Public consultations have been conducted for the project, and a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  developed  to  facilitate  resolution  of  project-related \nenvironmental impacts. \n \n2.  Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n27.  The  project  is  categorized  as  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  C  for  indigenous \npeoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. All affected land and structures \nidentified are owned by government organizations. The proposed stations for the BRT system \nwill only require clearance of small strips of government right-of-way land and public parks. \nStructures  affected  are  roadside  pavements  and  curbsides,  streetlights,  electricity  poles, \nsewage intakes, and tree and garden fences. For the proposed bus staging areas, the project \nwill acquire the entire compound (with three office buildings) owned by the Institute of Mass \nMedia and Culture (about 2,700 square meters) and a portion of land with no structures (about \n1,500 square meters) owned by the Vientiane Department of Education and Sports. The area \nfor the depot (about 1.7 hectares) is vacant land and is owned by the MPWT. No previous land \nacquisition occurred in anticipation of ADB financing. Due diligence has been conducted to \nconfirm that the depot site to be used by the project is not used by any person (i) who may be \neconomically displaced, (ii) whose structures have been or will be demolished, and/or (iii) who \nwill be restricted from using the specified area. All affected organizations have been consulted, \nand key information in the resettlement plan such as project entitlements, grievance redress, \ninstitutional arrangements, schedule, and cost estimates have been discussed and disclosed \nduring the preparation of the resettlement plan.23 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  The overall assessment is that there is a medium level of project risk that can be \nmitigated. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks \nand  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.24  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe SUTMA has insufficient capacity to ensure  The project will finance 16 months of the operations of \nsustainability of project operations.  the quality control company to assist in monitoring \noperators of the bus and parking components. \nLimited capacity in the PCU in implementation of  The project will finance international urban transport \nurban transport projects results in delayed  advisors with extensive experience in public transport \nproject implementation and slow disbursement.  operations.
