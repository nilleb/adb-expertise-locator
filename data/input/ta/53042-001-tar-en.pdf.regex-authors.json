The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has recognized the need to \nsupport economic development of rural areas through modernizing agriculture and reforming \nagriculture support programs toward more sustainable and greener economic development. The \nNational Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u201320221 was released aimed at reducing rural \npoverty,  modernizing  the  rural  economy,  enhancing  the  rural  ecological  environment,  and \npromoting green and inclusive growth. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), together with the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  signed  a \nmemorandum of understanding on 29 August 2018 to provide assistance in the following areas: \n(i) management of solid waste and wastewater by addressing rural and agricultural non-point \nsource pollution and promoting re-use of agricultural waste; and (ii) enhancing rural development \nthrough modernizing agriculture and raising productivity. More importantly, the rural vitalization \nstrategy aligns with, and builds on the ecological and environmental improvement priorities under \nADB\u2019s Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) framework approach and the government\u2019s YREB \nDevelopment Plan,2 further strengthening the foundation towards achieving the vision of an \necological civilization. This programmatic approach is anchored in an ensuing set of projects that \nwill help support efforts to reduce remaining pockets of poverty in rural areas consistent with \nnational poverty eradication objectives and a key operational priority under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.3 \n \n2.  This transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation support \nto a series of ensuing interrelated projects under a rural vitalization framework (Table 1). The TA \nfacility is suitable to ensure a consistent approach by (i) addressing cross-sectoral themes \nsupporting environment protection and rural vitalization through local capacity improvement; (ii) \nenhancing project implementation readiness; and (iii) strengthening coordination for sustainable \nrural development and environmental protection in the YREB and surrounding areas. All ensuing \nprojects require a similar set of safeguard, financial management, and economic assessments. \nThe TA facility will identify appropriate lending modalities for ensuing projects, and examine their \nsuitability for sector loans, sector development programs, financial intermediary loans, and \nresults-based lending, in addition to the standard project investment lending modality. In addition, \nthe TA facility will support exploring innovative financing models to address limited funding for \ninvestments in environmental protection and rural vitalization. The TA facility is consistent with \nthe ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020,4 and was included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u20132021.5 The design of the TA facility aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s sector and thematic operational plans, namely the Water Operational Plan 2011\u20132020, \nUrban  Operational  Plan  2012\u20132020,  Environment  Operational  Directions  2013\u20132020,  and \nOperational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources: Promoting Sustainable Food Security in \nAsia and the Pacific in 2015\u20132020.6  \n \n                                                \n1  Government of the PRC. 2018.
