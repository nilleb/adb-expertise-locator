THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation and \ncapacity building support to a series of two ensuing projects that focus on the improvement of the \nremaining sections of the Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Beyneu (A380) highway. The Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013\nNukus\u2013Beyneu Road Reconstruction Project 1 comprises (i) upgrading an existing 25 kilometers \n(km) section of the A380 (673\u2013698 km), (ii) installing an intelligent transport system (ITS) in \nsections of the A380 upgraded under the previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects (228\u2013\n581 km), and (iii) installing two weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems in adjacent sections of the A380 \n(228\u2013766 km). The Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Beyneu Road Reconstruction Project 2 comprises (i) \nreplacing the existing 92 km alignment of the A380 (581\u2013673 km) by approximately 86 km of a \nnew alignment (named Turtkul Bypass); (ii) construction of a service area; (iii) strengthening \nquality control through the provision of laboratory testing equipment and training in its use; and \n(iv) repair of 40 km of local roads and 10 bridges along the A380. Both ensuing projects will be in \nthe road sector. The two projects and the TA facility are listed in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for Uzbekistan, 2021\u20132023 and prepared at the request of the government, which \nasked the ADB to prioritize the 25 km section in January 2020.1 The TA facility will conduct the \nrelevant due diligence, improve project readiness, and provide capacity building activities for the \nconcerned executing and implementing agencies. \n \n2.  The Government of Uzbekistan has invested significantly in upgrading the 1,204 km A380 \nthat runs from Guzar through Bukhara and Nukus to Beyneu in Kazakhstan. The A380 forms part \nof the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridor 2 and is an important route \nfrom eastern Uzbekistan to the Caspian Sea port of Aktau and onwards to Turkey, the Russian \nFederation, and Europe that are amongst Uzbekistan\u2019s most important trading partners.2 It also \nforms a key route for domestic integration, connecting the remote Republic of Karakalpakstan to \nthe rest of Uzbekistan. Since 2007, different sections of the A380 have been successively \nupgraded through seven consecutive ADB loan projects and with government funding.3 Currently \nthere only remains 117 km gap (581\u2013698 km) that has not yet been upgraded, located around \nthe town of Turtkul in the Republic of Karakalpakstan.  \n \n3.  Road infrastructure. In Uzbekistan, the principal modes of transport are roads and \nrailways, which reinforce each other in forming a unified transport network. Uzbekistan has \n142,000 km of roads, out of which 42,695 km are public roads managed by the Committee for \nRoads. These are classified as international (3,981 km), state (14,100 km), and local roads \n(24,614 km). Over 95% of passengers are transported by road, so is 60% of freight. While the \nroad network is adequate in providing access throughout the country, it suffers from a backlog of \nrehabilitation work and is, thus, in generally poor condition, with older sections having outdated \nstandards. Since 2004, Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product has grown by more than 7% per \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n2  By value, these countries are the origin of approximately 40% of Uzbekistan\u2019s imports and the destination of \napproximately 60% of its exports.  \n3  ADB. 2007.

Uzbekistan is one of the countries in the world that is most vulnerable to climate change.4 \nThe proposed projects will adopt climate change adaption features in the design.5 \n \n4.  Institutional framework. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) was established to develop \nand implement a unified state policy for road, rail, air, river, and urban transport, and carry out \nstate regulation for transport and road agencies. The main institution for road transport is the \nCommittee for Roads under the MOT, which is engaged in the design, construction, and operation \nof public roads. The Republican Road Fund under the Cabinet of Ministers was subsumed under \nthe Committee for Roads on 1 January 2019.6 In December 2019, the Republican Road Fund \nwas  transformed  into  the  agency  \u201cAvtoyulinvest\u201d  and  designated  as  the  body  for  the \nimplementation of road transport investment projects involving funding from international financial \ninstitutions  and  foreign  government  financial  organizations,  as  financing  is  handled  by  the \nCommittee for Roads through Avtoyulinvest.7 \n \n5.  Strategic context. The government\u2019s Development Strategy for 2017\u20132021 pursues five \npriority areas, with transport and communications seen as a key element in supporting the priority \narea related to economic development and liberalization. The TA facility also promotes the \nimplementation of CAREC 2030,8 particularly operational clusters 2 (trade, tourism, and economic \ncorridors) and 3 (infrastructure and economic connectivity). This project also promotes the \nCAREC Transport Strategy 2030,9 particularly the strategic pillars on (i) cross-border transport \nand  logistics  facilitation,  by  facilitating  the  movement  of  cargo  from  Europe  and  the \nCommonwealth of Independent States countries; (ii) road safety, by increasing the road safety \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  Committee  for  Roads;  and  (iii)  road  asset  management,  by \nintroducing  state-of-the-art WIM  systems for  vehicle  overloading  control  and  ITS  for traffic \nmanagement. The TA facility is furthermore aligned with the ADB's Strategy 2030,10 which gives \nattention to the needs of landlocked economies and supports improving regional connectivity and \ncompetitiveness by addressing cross-border infrastructure needs. It is also consistent with ADB's \ncountry partnership strategy for Uzbekistan 2019\u20132023.11 The project will contribute to improved \ntrade and tourism activities in Uzbekistan through improved regional connectivity to key CAREC \ncorridor, as well as boosting Uzbekistan\u2019s role in transiting international goods and shipments by \nreducing transport costs and time, and increased road safety. The TA facility supports Area 3 of \nthe country partnership strategy (i.e., Promoting regional cooperation and integration). ADB has \na long tradition of supporting regional integration and cooperation through the CAREC Program, \nand its activities will support Uzbekistan\u2019s emerging role as a driver of regional cooperation. ADB \nwill promote regional power trade within the Central Asia Power System and regional connectivity \nalong major CAREC corridors; it will rehabilitate last-mile transport infrastructure near borders, \nmodernize cross-border gas pipelines, and support various sanitary and phytosanitary measures \n \n4  World Bank.

Having adopted the Concept for Tourism Development for 2019\u20132025, Uzbekistan \naims to transform tourism into a strategic sector of the economy. ADB will consider prospects for \ngreater  trade  integration  along  economic  corridors  between  Kazakhstan,  Tajikistan,  and \nUzbekistan. The development of these economic corridors and increased regional tourism are \npromising undertakings with potentially far-reaching implications for the Central Asia region as a \nwhole. Uzbekistan will also benefit from knowledge sharing between CAREC countries on various \ntopics of interest, including on WTO accession. \n \n6.  TA facility rationale. The Government of Uzbekistan, through the Committee for Roads, \nhas the capacity to prepare technical feasibility and detailed design studies. A detailed design has \nalready been prepared for the 25 km upgrading section, and a second detailed design is under \npreparation for the new Turtkul bypass. The TA facility will carry out due diligence for these \ndesigns, assessing the technical design standards, ensuring that climate change adaptation and \nroad safety features are properly incorporated, assessing any social and environmental impacts \nand related mitigation measures, identifying feasible gender design features, and verifying the \neconomic and financial viability of the concerned projects and their respective outputs. Attention \nwill also be given to institutional strengthening in the preparation and implementation of the \nselected project activities. The TA facility will support the government in these areas, ensuring \nthat the project activities are properly designed and prepared, and creating the necessary \ncapacities, through on the job training in the Committee for Roads and underlying entities, to carry \nout the two projects. The TA facility modality has been selected in light of the fact that the two \nensuing projects involve adjacent road sections located in similar geographical settings, both \nfulfilling a similar function of addressing the last remaining gap in the A380 and providing \nconnectivity to the Republic of Karakalpakstan and the border with Kazakhstan. As such it is \nconsidered more efficient to pool TA resources for both projects and to combine the different \nproject preparatory activities such as technical due diligence, socioeconomic impact assessment, \nand environmental and climate change impact assessment, for both projects. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Due diligence and preparation of the Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Beyneu \nRoad Reconstruction Project 1 carried out. The TA facility will provide technical expertise to \nprepare the road investment project for upgrading the existing 25 km section of the A380. This \nwill include all requisite technical due diligence, strategic procurement planning, environmental \nimpact assessment, social safeguards and indigenous peoples\u2019 due diligence, poverty, social, \nand gender assessment, governance assessment and integrity due diligence, economic and \nfinancial analysis, financial management assessment, road safety, climate change assessment, \naudit, and bidding document preparation and support. The TA facility will also identify existing \ncapacity and institutional constraints to be addressed in project 1, and identify measures to \nstrengthen project implementation and policy related issues.  \n \n8.  Output 2: Due diligence and preparation of the Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Beyneu \nRoad Reconstruction Project 2 carried out. The TA facility will provide technical expertise to \nprepare the road investment project for constructing the new Turtkul bypass in the A380. This will \ninclude  all  requisite  technical  due  diligence,  strategic  procurement  planning,  environmental \nimpact assessment, social safeguards and indigenous peoples\u2019 due diligence, poverty, social, \nand gender assessment, governance assessment and integrity due diligence, economic and \nfinancial  analysis,  financial  management  assessment,  road  safety  audit,  climate  change \nassessment, and bidding document preparation and support. The TA facility will also identify \n \n ", "4 \nexisting capacity and institutional constraints to be addressed in project 2, and identify measures \nto strengthen project implementation and policy related issues. \n \n9.  The TA facility is considered complex, because one of the ensuing projects is considered \ncomplex, and the loan amount for an ensuing project may exceed $200 million. ADB has \nexperience with each of the executing agencies, and safeguards classifications for the ensuing \nprojects would likely be B for environment and resettlement for project 1 and A for environment \nand resettlement for project 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,700,000, of which (i) $700,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-7), and (ii) $1,000,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and \nadministered by ADB,12 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n11.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, information materials, data, maps, and other in-kind contributions. The government was \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The TA facility activities for the ensuing projects will start only after ADB approves the \nproject concept paper for each of the ensuing projects. \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA facility, and the Transport and Communications Division of the \nCentral and West Asia Department will select, administer, and evaluate consultants under the TA \nfacility. The Committee for Roads will be the executing agency of the TA facility and will supervise \nproject preparation and strategy discussions. The Avtoyulinvest agency under the Committee for \nRoads will be the primary implementing agency of the TA facility and will provide staff to support \nand monitor project preparation under the TA facility for the ensuing projects.  \n \n14.
