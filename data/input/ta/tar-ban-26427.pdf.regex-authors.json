The devastating floods of 1987 and 1988 raised fears that such severe flooding was to \nbecome  the  norm  in  Bangladesh.  Consequently,  the  Government  and  the  international \ncommunity together formulated a comprehensive program, the Flood Action Plan (FAP), to \ndevelop a sustained solution to the dangers of annual flooding. As part of its commitment to \nimplementation  of  the  FAP,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  two  loans1  for \nintegrated flood protection in the urban centers,  including Dhaka and Khulna. While ADB's \nintervention proved to be very effective, as evidenced during another massive flooding in 1998,2 \nmuch more needs to be done to implement the recommendations of the FAP. A Fact-Finding \nMission visited Bangladesh from 25 September to 3 October 2002 to prepare the second phase \nof the Secondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection Project (STIFPP) as committed earlier. The \nMission had discussions with the Government officials, confirmed the objectives and scope of \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA),  and  reached  understanding  on  the \nconsultant's terms of reference as well as the implementation arrangements.3 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n2.  Recently, the Government of Bangladesh gave the highest national priority to poverty \nreduction.4 To achieve faster reduction in poverty, however, the economy will have to sustain a \ngrowth rate at least 7% per year for the next two decades. Given that agriculture, which is still \nthe backbone of the national economy, can grow at most 5-6% annually, the urban sector is \nexpected to become a source for the double-digit economic growth. In fact, although the level of \nurbanization in Bangladesh is still low (estimated at 23%) compared with that in other Asian \neconomies, already over 40% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) is derived from the \nurban sector, from a low of 25% in the early 1970s. The Government\u2019s Fifth Five-Year Plan \n(1997-2002) projected that the urban sector GDP would grow at around 14% per annum, more \nthan twice the growth target of the national GDP.  \n \n3.  Recognizing the immense potentials of the urban sector, ADB has long supported \nintegrated  development  of  the  urban  centers  in  Bangladesh.  However,  unplanned  and \nuncontrolled urbanization in the past created tremendous pressure on basic urban infrastructure \nand became a source of inefficiency that limits the growth potential of the sector. Furthermore, \nthe concentration of population and activities in a few metropolitan cities aggravated urban \nenvironmental conditions in the absence of adequate capacities to manage urban growth.  \nTherefore ADB\u2019s strategy in the urban sector emphasizes spatially balanced infrastructure \ndevelopment together with institutional strengthening to improve local governance and increase \nthe efficiency of urban management.  \n \n4.  Like other areas in the country, over the years urban centers have suffered immensely \nfrom severe erosion and destruction of physical infrastructure caused by river activity and water- \nlogging. However, the urban areas are more prone to economic and human losses due to their \nhigh population density and concentration of industrial and investments sites. The Government \nhas been aware of the flooding and erosion problems in urban areas and several studies were \nundertaken as early as in the 1970s. However, no concerted major investments could be carried \nout mainly due to resource constraints. As a result, the urban areas, especially the secondary \n                                                                 \n1  ADB. 1991.

", "2 \ntowns, have remained neglected. Before the major flood in 1988, annual allocation for providing \nrelief to a large number of secondary towns remained at a modest level of $1.5 million a year. \nThis amount has increased since then, but much more is needed to protect the potentials of the \nurban centers from the threats of recurring floods. \n \n5.  With more than 200 river systems across the country and some 40% of its inland area \nunder waterways, Bangladesh has a long history of flooding. Rainfall during the monsoon period \nbrings invaluable benefits for agriculture, fishing, and navigation, but in abnormal years, it brings \ndisaster. The floods of 1988 and 1998\u2013which caused damage estimated at $1.3 billion and $1 \nbillion, respectively\u2013highlighted the enormity and urgency of the problem and aroused much \ninternational concern. Ultimately, wide-ranging support from multilateral and bilateral agencies \nat  a  conference  in  London  in  1989  led  to  the  creation  of  the  FAP,  which  comprises \napproximately 26 components including five regional studies and numerous thematic studies \ncovering technical, environmental, and social issues. While the FAP contributed tremendously \nto understanding the complex technical, ecological, social, and cultural aspects of flooding in \nBangladesh, the FAP process was not free from controversy. Several domestic and external \ninterest groups campaigned against what they saw as a preconceived bias for the engineering \nand physical approach embedded in the FAP process.  Accordingly, the scope of the FAP \nstudies was broadened to cover the crosscutting issues in  greater depth. But even so, the \nlegacy of controversy remained.  \n \n6.  By the time of the 1998 flood, implementation of the FAP was at various stages; in some \ncases, impacts could be clearly seen while in others, project implementation had not reached \nthe state where demonstrable impact could be expected. Overall, there is evidence that the FAP \nprocess yielded some positive results and reduction in flood damages. One FAP work that had \na  positive  impact  was  the  ADB-funded  Dhaka  Integrated  Flood  Protection  Project  for  the \nwestern part of Dhaka.  \n \n7.  Similarly, the first phase of STIFPP helped protect Khulna and five secondary towns5 \nfrom annual floods within a framework of integrated urban environmental management.  The \nSTIFPP tried to integrate flood protection with drainage, sanitation, solid waste management, \nand slum development. The various earlier studies related to flood protection of secondary \ntowns remained largely at master planning, or at project identification/prefeasibility stage. Where \nelements were carried out, they were implemented by various agencies on an ad hoc basis \nwithout proper coordination. Such piecemeal efforts were generally ineffective and, in some \ncases,  inadvertently  compounded  the  environmental  health  hazards.  Inadequate drainage \nresulted in polluted waters remaining stagnant in low-lying lands (often densely populated slum \nareas) for long periods. Uncoordinated collection and disposal of solid waste contributed to \nlocalized  flooding  due  to  clogged  drains.  Similarly,  inadequate  and  ineffective  excreta \nmanagement led to high levels of exposure to waterborne pathogens during floods. A clear, \nurgent need thus emerged to integrate flood protection works with other infrastructure and \nenvironment improvement measures in selected high-priority secondary towns to maximize the \nimpact.   \n \n8.  Although the implementation of the STIFPP was delayed by 2 years due to unforeseen \nnatural  causes  and  political  events,  flood  protection  facilities  constructed  under  it  safely \nwithstood annual flood seasons. Moreover, the monitoring and evaluation reports confirmed that \ntotal beneficiaries exceeded the targets set during project appraisal. The respondents in both \nslum and non slum areas cited significant direct benefits from reduced flood damage, including \nimproved  hygiene  and  a  cleaner  environment,  and  more  efficient  solid  waste  collection. \nSubstantial  indirect  benefits  included  better  housing,  higher  land  values,  increased  daily \nincomes, and reduction in illness and medical costs. The STIFPP also provided significant \nconstruction  employment  opportunities  for  the  local  poor,  and  livelihood  skills  training  for \nwomen-led community-based handicraft industries.   \n \n                                                                 \n5 Dinajpur, Kurigram, Panchagarh, Habiganj, and Moulavibazar.  ", "3 \n9.  To sustain the success of the project on the engineering and physical side, it is essential \nthat the project towns improve financial performance to meet the requirements for regular \noperation and maintenance. During project implementation, the performance of the project \ntowns in fulfilling the requirements of the financial covenants was not satisfactory. The targets \nset in the institutional, financial, and operational action plan were often not met. The project \ncompletion report on the STIFPP strongly recommended that financial sustainability be given \nthe highest priority in preparing the next phase.  \n \n10.  In the long term, the strategy for flood protection will require further consolidation of the \nFAP  process  and  its  integration  with  the  national  water  management  plan.  Following  the \napproval of the national water policy in 1999, the Government has just finalized the national \nwater management plan as a broad-based plan based on a participatory planning approach.  \nUnder the plan, full flood protection will be concentrated in urban areas and areas of high \neconomic importance. But the selection of the urban areas for flood protection should be \nconsistent  with  the  criteria  for  integrated  water  resource  management.  The  long-term \nsustainability of flood protection can only be assured when the necessary institutional reforms \ntake place together with physical investments.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The objective of the TA is to prepare a project suitable for ADB financing that will provide \nin selected secondary towns a relatively flood-free and secure living environment within the \nframework of integrated urban environmental management. A special feature of the Project will \nbe the integration of flood protection works with drainage system improvement, solid waste \ndisposal, and upgrading of slums in secondary towns. Sustainability of the project investments \nwill be ensured by enhancing the operational efficiency of the Bangladesh Water Development \nBoard (BWDB) as well as improving management and financial performance of the participating \nmunicipalities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  Sixteen towns were identified under the FAP using the objective criteria involving, \namong  other  things,  severity  of  flooding  and  erosion  problems,  existing  infrastructure \ndeficiencies that aggravate flooding problems, and the need to achieve an optimum geographic \nbalance. However, more than 10 years have passed since the selection of these high-priority \ntowns  for  follow-up  investments.  It  is  therefore  opportune  that  the  TA  will  update  flood \ninformation on the 10 remaining towns and finalize the selection of the secondary towns to be \nincluded  in  phase  2.  The  10  towns  are  Sunamganj,  Rajshahi,  Bhairabbazar,  Gaibandha, \nJamalpur,  Manikganji,  Kustia,  Mymensing,  Brahmanbaria,  and  Munshiganji.  In  addition  to \ntechnical and engineering assessment, the consultants will also evaluate the willingness of the \nproposed  project  towns  to  undertake  necessary  reforms  to  improve  their  managerial  and \nfinancial performance. Due to the importance attached to  the long-term sustainability of the \nproject investments, the commitment to urban governance reform will provide additional criteria \nfor finalizing the selection of towns for the Project.  \n \n13.  While the exact scope of the ensuing Project will be determined after the completion of \nthe TA, the Project is expected to have four parts: (i) flood protection; (ii) drainage system \nimprovement; (iii) urban environmental improvement (solid waste disposal, sanitation, and slum \nimprovement); and (iv) capacity  building and implementation assistance (including consulting \nservices and training). In the first project, flood protection works had the highest share (48.7%) \nof the total physical investments, followed by drainage (45.1%) and environmental improvement \n(6.2%).   \n ", "4 \n14.  For success in preparing the Project, the key TA activities will cover the following: (i) \nreview of the lessons learned from the first project and assessment of the policy framework for \nflood protection; (ii) selection of the project towns using criteria developed in the first project; (iii) \ncollation/review of town information through socioeconomic surveys, engineering field surveys, \nand secondary sources; (iv) preparation of an indicative investment program (including the \nspecific project components to meet the priority needs) for each selected town; (v) assessment \nof the feasibility (technical, economic, financial, social, environmental, and institutional) of the \nproposed investment packages; (vi) participatory workshops and stakeholder consultation; and \n(vii) institutional support and capacity building. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is \nin Appendix 1.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,130,000 equivalent, comprising foreign \nexchange of $500,000 and local currency of $630,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $900,000 to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $400,000 equivalent for the local currency costs. \nThe TA will be initially financed as a grant by the ADB\u2019s TA funding program but will be subject \nto reimbursement arrangements. If the technical assistance results in an ADB loan, ADB may \ncharge against the loan, and recover from it, the portion of the initial grant that exceeds \n$250,000 equivalent. The Government has given assurance that, when the TA begins, it will \ncontribute the remaining local currency cost of $230,000 equivalent for office accommodation, \ncounterpart  staff  support,  field  transport,  facilities  for  seminars  and  meetings,  and  other \nadministrative expenses. The Government will also provide all information required for the TA \nactivities. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The Government \nhas been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  BWDB  will  be  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall \ncoordination with Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and ADB. BWDB will also \nprovide full administrative and technical support to the consultants for flood protection and \ncontrol. As co-Executing Agency, LGED will extend all necessary administrative and technical \nsupport as required during implementation of the TA, especially for municipal infrastructure \ncomponents as well as institutional strengthening of the municipalities. LGED will also be \nresponsible for coordinating all project activities in the concerned municipalities. BWDB and \nLGED  will  provide  adequate  office  space  with  sufficient  communication  means  for  the \nconsultants. Two vehicles will be hired under the TA budget; and BWDB will provide additional \ntransport for the counterpart staff. \n \n17.  Before fielding the consultants, the Government will establish a TA steering committee, \nchaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources, and consisting of senior officials of \nall  concerned  agencies  (Local  Government  Division,  LGED,  BWDB,  Department  of \nEnvironment,  Ministry  of  Land,  Planning  Commission,  Economic  Relations  Department  of \nMinistry of Finance, Finance Division of Ministry of Finance, Implementation Monitoring and \nEvaluation  Division  of  Ministry  of  Planning,  Ministry  of  Women  and  Children  Affairs).  The \nsteering committee will meet at least three times during TA implementation to discuss the \nreports of the consultants after the inception, midterm, and final workshops.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months from April to October 2003. The consulting \nservices for the TA total 58.5 person-months: 18.5 international and 40 domestic, excluding the \ninputs of a local institution that will conduct a baseline socioeconomic survey. An international \nfirm will be engaged to organize the TA activities and produce the intermediate and final outputs \nfor review and approval by BWDB, LGED and ADB.  The international experts (with person-\nmonths in parenthesis) to be provided by the firm will include a flood control and planning \nengineer  as  team  leader  (7),  drainage  engineer  (1.5),  resettlement  specialist  (2),  social \ndevelopment specialist (2), environmental specialist (2.5), municipal finance expert/financial ", "5 \nanalyst (1.5), and project economist (2). The team leader will be fielded before mobilizing the \nmain group of the consultants, to set up the TA implementation office, with support from BWDB \nand LGED. The team leader will assist the ADB task manager in identifying and engaging \ndomestic individual consultants (up to 40 person-months) with expertise in flood control and \nplanning,  engineering  design,  drainage  systems,  hydraulics  and  roads  engineering, \nenvironmental evaluation, resettlement, gender and development, municipal finance/financial \nanalysis, economic analysis, and water resources institutional development. ADB will engage \nthe international firm and domestic individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  The team leader will appoint an individual domestic deputy team leader within 4 weeks \nafter the team leader\u2019s arrival in Bangladesh The international firm will contract reputed local \ninstitutions to conduct extensive socioeconomic and engineering field surveys as detailed in the \nterms of reference.6  The team leader will be responsible for monitoring and supervising the \nperformance of the domestic individual experts, and will ensure that the outputs of the domestic \nexperts will be fully integrated in the reports of the international firm.   In addition, international \nand  domestic  experts  will  be  supported  by  (up  to)  30  person-months  of  sub-professional \nservices  from  technical/support  staff  and  20  person-months  of  professional  services  from \ncounterpart staff. BWDB and LGED will provide two counterpart staff each, at the level of \nexecutive engineer, to work with the consultants during TA implementation. The international \nfirm will recruit and engage the sub-professional staff.  The detailed responsibilities of the \ninternational firm will be confirmed and finalized during contract negotiation to be attended by \nthe representatives of BWDB, LGED, ADB, and the selected firm.   \n \n20.  A simplified technical proposal with the quality and cost-based selection method will be \nused to select the international firm. The consultants\u2019 reporting requirements will include (i) an \ninception report within 6 weeks of TA commencement (including the review of lessons learned \nand the work plan); (ii) an interim report within 12 weeks of TA commencement (including field \nvisit reports, indicative investment program for the selected towns, and project framework); (iii) a \ndraft final report within 25 weeks (including a full feasibility study); and (iv) a final report within \n30 weeks of TA commencement. During implementation, the consultants will organize three \nworkshops in Dhaka to discuss the inception, interim, and draft final reports. A broad range of \nlocal stakeholders will be invited to the interim and the final workshops. The consultants will also \norganize participatory town-hall meetings in all selected towns during field visits to disseminate \ninformation on the Project and incorporate the feedback from local stakeholders in the project \ndesign. The interim workshop will include a program for gender and development to discuss \ngender-related issues and the gender action plan under the Project. Tripartite meetings will be \nheld immediately after the workshops for the inception, interim, and draft final reports.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 to the Government \nof Bangladesh for preparing the Secondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection II Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. The technical assistance, initially financed as a grant, \nwill be subject to the reimbursement arrangements set forth in Technical Assistance Operations7 \nand Streamlining of Technical Assistance Operations.8 If the technical assistance results in an \nADB loan, ADB may charge against the loan, and recover from it, the portion of the initial grant \nthat exceeds $250,000 equivalent.  \n                                                                 \n6  A national nongovernment organization (NGO) may be engaged for the socioeconomic survey. \n7 ADB. 1997.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country  Sector identified as a National Priority in Country \nPoverty Analysis                             Yes  Poverty Partnership Agreement      Yes \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in (Bangladesh): Though modest gains \nhave been achieved over the years in reducing poverty, in Bangladesh close to half the population still \nlive in absolute poverty. PMS (poverty monitoring survey) data (1999) show that poverty has declined \nfrom 47.9% to 44.9% in rural areas and from 44.4% to 43.3% in the urban areas. PMS results also \nsuggest a slight improvement in the income distribution over the 1996 and 1998 periods. The country is \nregularly  subject  to  flooding,  causing  large-scale  damage  to  crops,  livestock,  and  infrastructure. \nRiverbank erosion is a major contributory factor to rural poverty and the resultant migration of the \neconomically poor from the rural to the urban areas. This has translated into about 5.0% annual growth \nrate of the urban population. The urban-rural contrast in the nature of poverty has only very recently \nreceived attention in Government programs. Inadequate targeting of social policies for the urban poor in \nthe past was coupled with insufficient recognition of the fact that development of secondary towns was \nthe basis for the sustainability of rural development. Many of the secondary towns are subject to regular \nflooding and river erosion. \n \nThe high urban income poverty and human poverty are the immediate and direct results of physical \ndamage to infrastructures due to urban flooding and river erosion. Inadequate and congested internal \ndrainage  systems  cause  waterclogging  and  overflowing  of  sewerage  and  result  in  widespread \nenvironmental  degradation.  The  proposed  project  will  be  instrumental  in  contributing  significantly \ntowards  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  improvements  in  the  selected  secondary  towns  by \nproviding relevant infrastructure and delivery of other services. The proposed project will also contribute \nto the achievements made so far by improving urban governance in secondary towns. The identification \nof the subsector as a national priority is within the framework of the Country Poverty Analysis and the \nresulting Country Poverty Partnership Agreement with Bangladesh. \n \nB. Poverty Analysis                                               Proposed Classification: Poverty intervention                      \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? For proper planning, a detailed and multidimensional \npoverty analysis will be required. The household income and expenditure survey report does not \ncontain detailed district-level data. Hence, the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will be \nrequired to collect in depth socioeconomic and poverty-related data for each of the 10 towns. The data \nwill include income and expenditure, demographic trends, gender issues, health, water and sanitation, \nchild labor, and urban environment. Detailed analysis of the dynamics of poverty, at economic (income) \nand non-economic (nonincome) levels, the causes (real and perceived), manifestations and outcomes \nof poverty will be conducted . The PPTA will use the findings of this socioeconomic baseline survey for \nthe final selection of the towns and project design.  Analysis of poverty implications through a review of \npolicies and programs and existing initiatives of the Government and other partners in development will \nbe done. Past and existing poverty reduction strategies will be assessed to identify changes required to \nachieve the local poverty reduction targets.  Identification of constraints and barriers (both internal and \nexternal) will be made, and possible actions for achieving project objectives will be considered.  \n \nC. Participation Process \n \nParticipatory  Strategy  Required:  The  PPTA  will  use  participatory  methods  of  consultation  and \ninformation gathering. Using the appreciative inquiry approach and participatory and rapid assessment \nmethods, the involvement of all the concerned stakeholders, including the disadvantaged and women, \nwill be ensured to identify the required support and possible means to ensure their participation at all \nstages of the project cycle. The PPTA will identify the need for and types of special provisions required \ninto  the  project  design  to  enable  full  participation  of  women  and  the  marginalized  and  or \nminority/indigenous people (if any come within the ambit of the proposed project). The socioeconomic ", "Appendix 1  7 \nbaseline  survey  will  be  conducted  by  an  experienced  local  nongovernment  organization \n(NGO)/institution. To highlight issues at micro and macro levels, the degree of poverty among women \nand men and the existing labor market will be assessed through consultation with stakeholders (all \ncategories and levels). Both primary and secondary stakeholders (Government, local administration, \nmunicipalities, NGOs, citizens, aid and international agencies) along with their interests and capabilities \nwill be assessed. By organizing a gender workshop at the central level, the PPTA will ensure women\u2019s \ninvolvement  and  participation  in  all  stages  of  the  proposed  project.  To  ensure  ownership  and \nsustainability of the project, workshops to flag milestones of the project will be organized at the central \nlevel and at local levels in each of the 10 proposed project towns. At these workshops for information \nsharing, consultation, shared decision making and shared responsibility, the roles and functions of the \nstakeholders will be identified. Participatory planning meetings with the municipalities and relevant \nstakeholders (ensuring that the needs of women are given positive consideration) will be held during \nthe PPTA implementation.   \n \nD.
