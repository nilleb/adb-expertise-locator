INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA)1 assists the knowledge-driven \noperational approach of the country partnership strategy (CPS) for India, 2018\u20132022 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the associated India Country Knowledge Plan (CKP), 2018\u20132022.2 \nThe CPS and the CKP emphasize strategic and analytical studies at geographical (state, regional, \ncorridor), sector, and thematic levels as a means to identify viable development pathways, \ntransformative investment opportunities, and policy advice, while filling critical knowledge and \ncapacity gaps. This approach aims to drive ADB operations to (i) contribute to the CPS goal of \naccelerating inclusive economic transformation; and (ii) respond to India\u2019s emerging needs as a \nrapidly growing country, including the relevant priority agendas in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.3 The TA \nis included in the country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021, in which TA resources were \naugmented  in  response  to  (i)  the  fast  buildup  of  operational  pipelines  aligned  with  CPS \narchitecture, and (ii) the need to swiftly put into operation the priority themes of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 for client agencies concerned.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  With an average gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of over 7% since 2012, India \nis among the fastest-growing economies in the world, contributing to 3% to the world\u2019s GDP in \n2016. The country has been successful in reducing its poverty rate by more than half since 2004, \nand it has achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals. However, to further accelerate \nits growth trajectory, India needs to address the remaining and emerging structural challenges: \n \n(i)  Large infrastructural deficits. ADB estimated that India needs to invest $230 billion per \nyear in infrastructure.5 As the demand for critical infrastructure grows and becomes more \ncomplex, the country\u2019s capacities, systems, and resources to strategically plan, design, \nimplement, and sustain infrastructure call for substantial augmentation, with mobilization \nof private capital and innovative financing instruments. \n(ii)  Widening income gaps among and within states. While India has become the fastest-\ngrowing large economy of the world with an average annual GDP growth rate of more than \n7% since 2012, the variation in GDP per capita among different regions in India remains \nhigh.6 Achieving strong and balanced regional development is key to inclusive economic \ngrowth. This calls for faster and strategic investments and systematic capacity building to \nbetter address issues faced by low-income states and regions, including infrastructure, \nindustrial potential, human capital, and governance including implementation constraints. \n(iii)  Need to create quality jobs. The rate of formal job creation needs to be commensurate \nwith the growth rate in GDP. Faster manufacturing and modern services sector growth are \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on 21 \nAugust 2018. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Environmental degradation in \nIndia costs about $80 billion annually, which is 5.7% of GDP.8 Air pollution, urban \ncongestion, forest degradation, and depleted water resources have emerged as major \nchallenges. India is also one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to natural \nhazards and the impacts of climate change. Building (a) robust management plans and \nsystems to monitor and control environmental degradation, (b) a knowledge base to cope \nwith climate challenges, and (c) resilient infrastructure against these vulnerabilities are \ntherefore critical priorities. \n(v)  Inadequate private sector participation. The private sector needs to play a vital role in \nIndia to accelerate economic growth by (a) increasing the market share of export, (b) \nrapidly expanding domestic markets with higher competitiveness and integration with \nvalue chains, and (c) filling the large gap between the requisite and current trend of \ninfrastructure investments. The government is making efforts to improve the ease of doing \nbusiness for the private sector to attract investments from foreign and domestic sources, \nand  it  is  pursuing  reforms  to  revitalize  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  infrastructure \ninvestments. \n \n3.  The CPS for India, 2018\u20132022 is structured to address the critical challenges outlined in \npara 2 and accelerate inclusive economic transformation by establishing three strategic pillars: (i) \nboosting economic competitiveness to create more and better jobs, (ii) providing inclusive access \nto infrastructure networks and services, and (iii) addressing climate change and increasing climate \nresilience (footnote 2). The CPS has prioritized six sectors (transport; energy; water and other \nurban infrastructure and services; public sector management; agriculture, natural resources and \nrural development; and education), with three crosscutting thematic priorities of private sector \ndevelopment, regional cooperation and integration, and gender and social inclusion. The CPS \nprovides a basis to implement these priorities through a knowledge-driven approach, by providing \npartner agencies with strategic and analytical studies to define effective development strategies, \ntransformative investments, and policy and capacity building advice. ADB has launched a number \nof studies, including on industrial corridors in east coast states, the Uttar Pradesh infrastructure \nframework in employment zones, and the Assam vision for regional integration with Southeast \nAsia. \n \n4.  In July 2018, the ADB Board of Directors approved Strategy 2030, mandating ADB to \ndeliver stronger, better, and faster services, with a country-focused approach. It draws attention \nto (i) fast-growing middle-income countries requiring integrated solutions and new technologies \nto address new and complex challenges; and (ii) remaining poverty, where ADB\u2019s more effective \nvalue  addition  could  be  explored,  including  social  sectors.  Thus,  Strategy  2030  promotes \nexploring new opportunities and fostering deeper engagements in priority areas to provide \ncomprehensive solutions, including (i) building livable cities with holistic urban planning and \nmunicipal reforms; (ii) improving multimodal logistics and transport networks; (iii) making smart \nand new technology-driven power sector investments and reforms; (iv) accelerating regional \n                                                \n7  Industry 4.0 is a name given to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies.

As development challenges evolve faster in a rapidly growing economy, ADB needs to \nrespond to India\u2019s evolving needs with quality knowledge solutions in a timely manner. This \nincludes responding to short-term needs with short analytical studies and policy briefs on critical \nissues, undertaking surveys and initial analyses while awaiting the mobilization of TA resources \nand  expert  teams,  providing  short-term  expert  inputs  and  capacity  support  to  government \nagencies, and undertaking in-country and overseas exposure for government officials in the form \nof study tours and other knowledge engagements. Knowledge transfer and dissemination also \nplay a critical role in effective and strategic policy decision-making. \n \n6.  Building a knowledge-driven economic development mechanism helps accelerate and \nsustain strong, robust, and inclusive economic growth in the long term. India has built pockets of \nknowledge-driven growth, which need to be translated into a broader sphere of its economy. To \nstrengthen  the  country\u2019s  knowledge-driven  development,  the  range  of  knowledge  services, \napproaches, and models based on best practices from successful knowledge-based advanced \neconomies needs to be developed, and the unique knowledge and strengths of the country need \nto be exploited by aggressively pursuing and applying new technologies.9 The TA aims to meet \nIndia\u2019s knowledge needs within the framework of the CPS and Strategy 2030. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: knowledge base to support the rapid growth \nof the Indian economy and its fast-evolving socioeconomic development needs improved (project \ndefined).  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcomes:  strategic  interventions  for  economic \ntransformation (including sector and thematic reforms) commenced, and investment pipeline for \nADB and other external funding agencies developed.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Analytical, sectoral, and crosscutting thematic studies prepared. The TA \nwill undertake strategic and analytical studies incorporating crosscutting themes to support central \nand state government departments and agencies in the implementation of strategic interventions \nin areas relevant to ADB\u2019s CPS for India, 2018\u20132022 and Strategy 2030. The studies will be at \nthree levels: \n \n(i)  Sectoral level. The  studies  and reports  will  include  integrated  climate  change  and \ndisaster-resilient infrastructure plans; industry skills demand analyses; skills development \nplans for enhancing employability of human resources; transport studies for enhancing \nconnectivity projects that are sustainable; urban studies to design and implement green, \ncompetitive, and inclusive urban projects; energy infrastructure gap studies to identify and \ndevelop green energy corridors and projects; studies for strengthening the finance sector; \nand  studies  for  enhancing  agriculture  value  chains,  irrigation,  and  innovative  water \nmanagement solutions in rural areas. \n(ii)  Geographical level. The studies and reports will include state vision documents  for \ncomprehensive economic development of low-income states; industrial cluster studies to \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2014.

These studies and reports will include those that outline the development \nof innovative models for partnerships between the public and private sectors for financing \ninfrastructure  projects  and  reports  for  enhancing  regional  cooperation,  including \ndeveloping multimodal transport linkages between India\u2019s northeast states and the rest of \nAsia. Studies will also focus on gender mainstreaming and gender assessments in urban, \nskill development, transport, and energy projects. \n \n9.  Output 2: Capacity of government agencies strengthened. The TA will synthesize \nknowledge  products  and  programs  for  capacity  development  and  cross-learning  of  project \nagencies and other institutions in low-income states. The support will aim at strengthening the \ngovernance and institutional capacity of government agencies to (i) improve the business and \nregulatory environment for greater economic activity; (ii) improve their capacity for developing \nclimate change mitigation, disaster resilience, and gender mainstreaming measures in project \npreparation; (iii) enable the planning and development of smart cities; and (iv) support the \ndevelopment of innovative modalities for renewable energy infrastructure financing. Based on \nrequests made by the central and state governments, institutional capacity building programs \n(including workshops, conferences, roundtable discussions, and knowledge sessions) will be \norganized in low-income states and other locations on various topics, including climate change, \ngender equality, and disaster management. Just-in-time knowledge requests of the government \nwill be supported through short policy notes and knowledge forums for government agencies.   \n \n10.  Output 3: Knowledge products produced and disseminated. In line with the CKP, \nimportant studies, research, conference outcomes, and good practices will be delivered to \nstakeholders (including government agencies and policy makers, businesses, and concerned \nnational and international audiences). They will be delivered through (i) publications in the form \nof (preferably digital) reports, books, working papers, and blog posts; and (ii) periodic and focused \nconferences, seminars, workshops, and other knowledge-sharing and dissemination activities \n(e.g., presentations at investment forums and intergovernmental summits). Examples include \nregional connectivity studies; research reports on application of advanced and new technologies \nfor disaster management; synthesis of gender mainstreaming in prioritized sectors including \nchallenges  for  women  contractors  in  ADB-financed  projects  and  time-saving  infrastructure \ntechnologies from a gender perspective. The TA will also focus on building the skills of officials in \ncentral and state government agencies and capturing and sharing their experiences and insights \nthrough Development Asia.11 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,885,000, of which $3,700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  workshop  venues,  office \naccommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n11 Development Asia is ADB\u2019s knowledge collaboration platform for sharing development experience and expertise, \nbest practice, and technology relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented from 15 December 2018 to 14 December 2021. ADB will \nadminister the TA through India Resident Mission, South Asia Department in consultation with its \nsector divisions. Under the overall guidance and coordination of the Government of India\u2019s \nDepartment of Economic Affairs, under the Ministry of Finance, the TA will be executed by the \nresident mission in consultation with central and state government departments and agencies \ninvolved in industrial policy and promotion, road transport and highways, power, housing, and \nurban affairs, among others. The resident mission will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; \nand undertake knowledge products, including studies, workshops, and study tours. \n \n13.
