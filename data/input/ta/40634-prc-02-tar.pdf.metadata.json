INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  was  originally  included  in  the \napproved project concept paper for the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (IMAR) Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement Project, phase II \nas  a  grant  component.1 During  subsequent  discussions,  the  government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  agreed  to  move  the  TA  processing  ahead  of  the  project  to \nimmediately  address  some  critical  capacity  gaps  of  local  governments  and  implementing \nagencies in planning and managing the energy efficiency investment projects. This is to avoid \npotential start-up delays, which were experienced in a similar loan project in IMAR.2 The TA \nscope and design were revised and adjusted to respond urgently to issues of inadequate \ncapacity.3 During the fact-finding mission in November 2009, the mission and the government \nreached an agreement on the TA impact, outcome, activities, and implementation arrangements \nincluding the terms of reference for consultants.4 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  IMAR is the third largest province in the PRC, covering 1.18 million square kilometers. \nBut it has a population of only 24.15 million (2008 census), which is 1.8% of the national total \npopulation. The region represents some of the poorest areas in the PRC. The provision of \nreliable and affordable household heating is a basic necessity as temperatures can fall to          \n\u201340o Celsius and the heating season can extend to 7 months. But the remoteness and low \npopulation density present unique challenges in district heating systems (DHSs).The district \nheating infrastructure consists largely of inefficient neighborhood coal-fired boilers with low \ncapacity  and  efficiency,  and  an  aging  and  poorly  insulated  pipe  network  that  has  high \ndistribution losses. In many urban areas, DHSs installed in the 1970s have now exceeded their \ndesign  lives,  resulting  in  unreliable  service.  Inefficiencies  in  production,  transmission,  and \ndistribution of heating services mostly impact the poorest in society. Also, the existing coal-fired \nboilers are highly polluting and lack emission-control devices, resulting in increased outdoor air \npollution and causing significant harm to public health.  \n \n3.  Due to aging and inefficient energy infrastructure, the IMAR economy is relatively energy \ninefficient,  using  2.31  tons  of  standard  coal  equivalent  per  CNY10,000  of  gross  domestic \nproduct, or double the national average of 1.16 tons (2007). To comply with the national priority \nof the 11th Five-Year Plan to improve energy intensity by 20%, IMAR has a relatively high \nprovincial target of 25%. IMAR depends heavily on coal, which accounts for more than 90% of \nprimary  energy  supply  and  95%  of  district  heating  supply.  Reliance  on  coal  has  a  high \nenvironmental cost for urban areas, with only 6 of 15 cities reaching the acceptable class II air \nquality standards (2008). Investing in new and more efficient urban energy efficiency projects \nincluding DHS will help IMAR reach the emission targets specified in the plan.5 \n  \n4.  To respond to the sector needs of improving energy efficiency, ADB has provided a loan \n(footnote 2) as part of the IMAR phase I project for DHSs in Byannur and Wuhai cities. A similar \nloan is being considered (IMAR phase II) to rehabilitate DHSs in other areas namely, Baotou, \n                                                 \n1  The $600,000 grant was to be funded from the Climate Change Fund. \n2  ADB. 2006.

The phase I project and the relevant TA6 \naddressed the capacity strengthening of relevant implementing agencies and the executing \nagency, the IMAR Finance Bureau. But during implementation of phase I, unfamiliarity of most \nof the implementing agencies with ADB project implementation requirements resulted in a         \n1 year start-up delay and subsequent slower implementation. Since the proposed IMAR phase II \nloan involves new implementing agencies, capacity strengthening is recognized as a critical \nbarrier that may potentially delay phase II implementation and likely impact its sustainability. \nThe TA will target local governments in Baotou, Chifeng, Hohhot, Kalakin, Keyouqian, and \nZhalaite cities and selected implementing agencies to provide enhanced support during the \nstart-up  process  and  develop  their  capacity  in  planning  and  implementing  similar  energy \nefficiency projects. The TA will (i) enhance the project management and procurement capacity \nof the IMAR Finance Bureau and the project management office of the IMAR Development and \nReform Commission, and the implementing agency on an urgent basis; (ii) develop monitoring \nand reporting procedures for improved verification of DHS projects; and (iii) investigate demand-\nside energy efficiency measures, and develop a best practice paper to address implementation \nstrategies and public awareness material. \n  \n5.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 20207 to promote environmentally sustainable \ngrowth. It reflects the PRC country partnership strategy8 (2008\u20132010) and its pillars of resource \nefficiency and environmental sustainability. The TA supports ADB's Energy Efficiency Initiative \nto expand ADB investments in clean energy projects. It will build on continuing engagement with \nthe IMAR government in the energy sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The impact of the TA will be improved energy efficiency and environment in IMAR. The \noutcome will be enhanced capacity in planning and implementing energy efficiency projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The  TA  outputs  will  be  achieved  by  identifying  relevant  stakeholders  in  close \ncoordination with the IMAR Finance Bureau and implementing agencies. A consultation plan will \nbe prepared to assist in acquiring and disseminating information. The specific outputs comprise \nenhanced  project  management  capacity  in  implementing  DHS  projects,  development  of  \n(i) a monitoring and reporting procedure for DHSs, (ii) a best practice paper on demand-side \nconservation, and (iii) public awareness material. \n \n8.  The  consultant  will  examine  international  best  practices  and  methods  to  conserve \nenergy in the district heating subsector, and combine these with the IMAR experience and \nexpectations to develop an implementation strategy for demand-side conservation of energy. \nThis strategy will be developed in a participatory manner seeking active participation of key \nstakeholders. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007.

The major assumptions in relation to successful TA implementation include retention and \nmaintenance  of  capacity  developed  within  the  stakeholder  organizations,  and  continued \ngovernment commitment to improve demand-side conservation in the district heating subsector. \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two parts to meet the urgent but diverse needs of the \nproject planning and management aspects of energy efficiency investments. Part 1 will address \nthe  critical  capacity  strengthening  needs  of  a  group  of  diverse  and  widely  dispersed \nimplementing  agencies  in  specific  DHS  implementation.  This  is  directly  relevant  to  avoid \npotential start-up issues with the IMAR phase II investment. Part 2 will mainly target provincial \nagencies in the overall planning and management aspects of demand-side management issues \nin IMAR. This part will enhance the sustainability of DHS and other energy efficiency projects in \nIMAR. The key activities of the TA will include the following:  \n \n(i)  Part  1:  Project  management  capacity  development  will  provide  (a)  project \nmanagement training in DHS investment projects, and (b) assistance in overall \nprocurement planning and preparation of essential procurement documentation. \n \n(ii)  Part 2: Capacity development on monitoring, reporting, and demand-side energy \nconservation  will  (a)  develop  energy  efficiency  monitoring  and  reporting \nprocedures for district heating, (b) develop a stakeholder consultation plan to \naddress  demand-side  conservation  in  the  heating  subsector,  (c)  summarize \ninternational experiences including best practices on demand-side conservation \nin the heating subsector, (d) develop best practice implementation strategies and \npublic awareness material on demand-side energy conservation most suited to \nIMAR based on stakeholder consultation and international best practice, (e) hold \nconsultations  with  stakeholders  and  disseminate  outputs  through  targeted \nworkshops  and  seminars  in  close  association  with  relevant  government \ndepartments, and (f) conduct national and international study tours to provide \npractical  demonstrations  of  DHS  used  in  similar  climatic  and  topographic \nconditions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $500,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from the Climate Change Fund.9 The government will finance the \nremaining  $200,000  equivalent  through  in-kind  contributions,  including  provisions  for  office \naccommodation and facilities, counterpart staff and data, and other information needed for the \nTA. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook.10 The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The IMAR Finance Bureau will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of the TA \nactivities, including coordination with other key stakeholders and logistic support to consultants. \nADB will engage international and national consultants, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Three  person-months  of \ninternational consulting and 27 person-months for national consultants will be required. Part 1 \nwill  be  implemented  by  three  individually  selected  consultants  to  address  the  critical  and \n                                                 \n9  Established by ADB. \n10 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "4   \nimmediate project management capacity needs of the IMAR phase II investment projects. Since \nthe subprojects are widely dispersed geographically, the team work is particularly challenging in \nIMAR cities. To overcome this, two procurement specialists (8 person-months) will be assigned \nto different geographic areas\u2014Baotou, Hohhot on the western side of IMAR and Chifeng, \nKalakin,  Keyouqian,  and  Zhalaite  on  the  eastern  side\u2014to  address  the  weak  capacity  in \nprocurement planning and bidding document preparation. This responds to a key lesson from \nsimilar projects in IMAR. The project management specialist (5 person-months) will train and \nsupport the project management office of the IMAR Development and Reform Commission in \ncoordination of key planning and management issues with the implementing agencies and ADB. \nSince these tasks are essentially independent, immediately needed, and will be implemented by \nonly  three  consultants,  the  individual  consultant  selection  method  is  considered  most \nappropriate as per ADB guidelines. For part 2, ADB will request use of the simplified technical \nproposal, and consultants will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method \n(quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20).   \n \n13.  Procurement of equipment, supplies, and materials by the TA consultants will follow \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Since the TA activities \nare spread over a large geographic area, the equipment budget allocated for the TA is $25,000 \nso that the consultants can be adequately supported in all their field activities. Any equipment \npurchased under the TA will be turned over to the IMAR Finance Bureau and/or the project \nmanagement office after completion of the TA.  \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented from January 2010 to June 2011. The consultants for part 2 \nwill submit an inception report within 1 month; a draft final report within 6 months, and the final \nreport  within  7  months  from  the  date  of  engagement.  Information  on  the  progress  of \nimplementation  and  on  TA  outputs  will  be  disseminated  through  regular  meetings  and \nworkshops. The TA outcome will be subject to evaluation by both ADB and the government in \naccordance with their respective evaluation policies and requirements. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China for Energy Efficiency Improvements in Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5  \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting   \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved energy  IMAR achieves 12%  Annual environment  The IMAR phase II project \nefficiency and  energy intensity  monitored data published  is planned and \nenvironment in IMAR  improvement by 2015  by IMAR and relevant  implemented on a timely \n  compared to 2009  cities and counties  basis. \n     \nAir quality in all 15  Local environment  Risk \ncities in IMAR achieves  protection bureau reports  Air emission \nPRC Class II standards    improvements are negated \nby 2013  by the establishment of \n  new polluting industries. \n \nAny future tariff reform on \nDHS does not take into \naccount the \nrecommendations of the \nbest practice paper. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced capacity in  Implementation of  IMAR phase II project  The capacity developed is \nplanning and  IMAR phases I and II  performance report  retained and maintained \nimplementing energy- projects on key project    within the stakeholder \nefficiency projects  indicators improves    organizations. \nfrom 2010     \n    The government is willing \nRecommendations of  Final TA report  and committed to \nmonitoring and  improving demand-side \nreporting procedure  conservation in the district \nand best practice paper  heating subsector. \nare considered by the   \ngovernment of IMAR by  Risk \n2011  Low heating tariffs \nundermine investments \nand future reform \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
