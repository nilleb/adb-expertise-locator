I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Bihar  Urban  Development  Investment \nProgram.1 \n \n2.  Bhagalpur,  Darbhanga,  Gaya,  and  Muzaffarpur  are  the  four  largest  towns  with  the \nhighest economic growth potential in Bihar, after the state capital, Patna. Despite being the \neconomic centers of Bihar, the four towns have been unable to achieve the national urban \nservice goals or match many of the national averages for urban service delivery performance in \nIndia. Their inability to sustain water supply and sewerage services is the result of inadequate \nsize  and  condition  of  infrastructure,  mainly  attributed  to  inadequate  new  investment  and \noperation and maintenance (O&M). The investment program will improve and expand the water \nand sewerage infrastructure in the four towns, and help urban local bodies (ULBs) of the four \ntowns\u2014the infrastructure owners\u2014to ensure discipline and structures for operations that result \nin sustainable O&M.2   \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In FY2010, Bihar\u2019s gross state domestic product (GSDP) ranked 14th among all states in \nIndia; its per capita GSDP of Rs17,9593 at current prices was the lowest. Bihar\u2019s GSDP largely \ndepends on economic activities in urban areas; thus the importance of urban services for \neconomic growth has been increasing. In FY2011, tertiary sectors contributed 61% of the \nGSDP, secondary sectors 18%, and primary sectors 21% (footnote 3). Therefore, an increase in \nproductivity in urban areas is key to stimulating Bihar\u2019s GSDP. \n \nTable 1: Urban Service Delivery Performance in Largest Towns of Bihar \n \n  Water  Water  Hours of         \nSupply  Supply  Water  Metered  Sewerage  SWM  Landfill \nCoverage  Per Capita  Supply  Connections  Coverage  Coverage  Disposal \nItem  (%)  (lpcd)  (hpd)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nNational  94a\u2013100b  135c  24c  100c  70b\u2013100c  n/a  100d \ntargets \nNational  81  123  4  25  28  78  2 \naverage \nState target  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  100e  n/a \nPatna  36  92  14  0  43  38  0 \n(capital) \nBhagalpur  81  57  5  0  0  30  0 \nDarbhanga  36  28  12  0  0  35  0 \nGaya  82  29  5  0  0  35  0 \nMuzaffarpur  30  76  11  0  0  30  0 \n\u2026 = not available, lpcd = liters per capita per day, hpd = hours per day, SWM = solid waste management. \na  The Millennium Development Goal. \nb  Government of India. 2008.

Patna. ", "2 \n4.  Improving the urban environment and quality of life will lead to better health for the urban \npopulation and, hence, to an increase in labor productivity. Urban service in the four towns is \npoor (Table 1). The deterioration of key urban services (water supply, sewerage, and solid \nwaste management [SWM]) may jeopardize the potential of the towns to continuously play their \nrole as engines of economic growth in Bihar. Poor urban services negatively impact labor \nproductivity\u2014an increase in cases of water- and vector-borne diseases will prevent affected \nmembers of the working age population from engaging in income-generating activities. The \nconsequences of poor urban services greatly constrain women from engaging in much-needed \nadditional  and  alternative  sources  of  income  as  they  are  responsible  for  household  water \ncollection, waste disposal, family hygiene, and care of the sick. \n \n5.  The core problem for the ability of towns to sustain key urban services is the inadequate \nsize and condition of infrastructure. This is mainly attributed to inadequate new investment and \nO&M, stemming from four main problems:4 \n(i)  User charges. With no user charges, ULBs cannot recover O&M cost. Inability to \ncapture (a) accrued revenues and expenditures; and (b) apportioned common \nexpenses makes the calculation of appropriate user charges difficult, even if \nULBs are willing to levy user charges. \n(ii)  Accounting practice. In the absence of a dedicated account specific for each \nurban service, ULBs cannot accumulate internal reserves for major investments. \nAs  a  result,  they  rely  on  grants  from  various  national  and  state  schemes. \nUncertainty of the availability of financial resources makes planning for the future \ndifficult. \n(iii)  Public administration. The absence of a municipal civil service system means \nthat  ULBs  have  difficulty  accumulating  skills.  Most  staff  are  contracted  with \nmultiple assignments, often not having the qualifications and rarely devoted to \nspecialized tasks. \n(iv)  Human  resources.  Too few staff are recruited to sustain the water supply, \nsewerage,  and  SWM  services  at  the  national  target.  Along  with  difficulty \nattracting qualified personnel, ULBs have difficulty preparing a long-term plan \nand project proposals to attract financiers. \n \n6.  Urban service delivery. India\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan (April 2007\u2013March 2012) sets \nout 27 national targets, covering economic and social goals, including (i) ensure clean drinking \nwater is available to all by 2009, with no slippages by the end of the plan; and (ii) treat all urban \nwastewater by 2011/2012 to result in clean river water. The plan recognizes infrastructure \nbottlenecks and lack of long-term funds for infrastructure investment as binding constraints for \nachieving  the  goals.  The  plan  calls  for  public  sector  investment  to  meet  infrastructure \nrequirements where private participation is less likely. \n \n7.  Road map for achieving service targets. To achieve the national and state targets for \nwater supply, sewerage, and SWM services in the four towns, the Bihar state government, with \nassistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through the project preparatory technical \nassistance  (TA),  formulated  a  plan  that  matches  short-  and  long-term  goals  with  specific \nsolutions to help meet the targets\u2014a road map for 2010\u20132021. The key findings are as follows: \n(i)  The physical investment for water supply, sewerage, and SWM will cost about \nRs35 billion by 2021, and will incur annual O&M cost of about Rs414 million upon \nfull completion. \n                                                \n4 Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and Other Municipal Infrastructure and Services (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \n(ii)  To  create  a  sustainable  environment  for  physical  investment,5 the  ULBs,  in \ncollaboration with the state government, need to (a) formulate and adopt user \ncharge  and  subsidy  policies;  (b)  establish  an  administrative  body  for \nrecommending  user  charges;  (c)  migrate  to  an  accrual-based,  double-entry \naccounting  system;  (d)  establish  accounts  dedicated  to  each  urban  service \noperation; (e) install automated billing systems for the user charge; (f) increase \nO&M staff numbers; and (g) train O&M staff in the ULBs. \n(iii)  The  nonphysical  investment  for  construction  management,  systemic \nimprovements in operations, and capacity building will require Rs2,270 million. \n \n8.  Government and state government efforts. Various ongoing and planned investment \nprojects6 of the national and state governments, valued at about Rs3,500 million, cannot meet \nthe physical investment requirements of the road map. \n \n9.  Ongoing external assistance in Bihar. Since 2010, the state government has been \nundertaking various urban municipal governance reforms with assistance from the Support \nProgram for Urban Reforms (SPUR), financed by the Department for International Development \nof the United Kingdom. SPUR is a \u00a361 million ($95 million equivalent) program to support urban \ngovernance  and  planning, 7  municipal  financial  management,  municipal  infrastructure \nmanagement, local economic development, and poverty reduction in 28 ULBs, which include \nthe four towns. SPUR focuses on capacity building covering most of the reform requirements of \nthe road map.8 \n \n10.  ADB  strategy  and  focus.  The  country  partnership  strategy  and  ADB  assistance \nprogram9 for 2009\u20132012 were designed to support the Government of India\u2019s efforts to address \nthe binding constraints in the plan through four strategic pillars.10 One of the pillars emphasizes \nthe continuation of ADB assistance to infrastructure development in various sectors, including \nthe urban sector. The country operations business plan for India, 2012\u20132014 places more focus \non  less-developed  states,  and  allocates  an  MFF  of  up to  $200  million for  the  investment \nprogram. \n \n11.  Through the investment program, ADB will support a part of the funding shortfall for \nwater supply and sewerage infrastructure improvement11 proposed in the road map. The aim is \nto develop a complete system in a town by complementing the ongoing investment (footnote 6) \nof the national and state governments. The investment program will also increase the efficiency \nand cost-effectiveness of O&M by outsourcing operations through design\u2013build\u2013operate (DBO) \ncontractual arrangements, and support ongoing efforts to address user charges, subsidies, and \naccounting specific to water supply and sewerage operations. \n \n                                                \n5  Many of the items are also recommended under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Ministry of \nUrban Development. \n6  The urban infrastructure development scheme for small and medium-sized towns, the National Ganga River Basin \nAuthority, and other national and state budgetary allocations. \n7  As a part of the activities, SPUR helps the state government prepare an amendment of the Bihar Municipal Act to \ncreate a municipal civil service cadre, which will allow ULBs to retain their human resources. \n8  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  ADB. (2009). Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009-2012. Manila. \n10 The four strategic pillars are (i) supporting inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth, (ii) catalyzing \ninvestment  through  the  use  of  innovative  business  and  financing  solutions,  (iii)  strengthening  the  results \norientation, and (iv) emphasizing knowledge solutions and support for regional cooperation. \n11 In the absence of SWM master plans in the four towns and considering the complexity of substantial land \nacquisition and extensive stakeholder consultations, physical investment to SWM infrastructure is most suitable \nafter the subproject towns prepare and adopt an SWM master plan. Therefore it will be deferred to future financial \nassistance. SPUR supports the preparation of SWM master plans in the selected towns. \n ", "4 \n12.  A series of project loans through an MFF is the most suitable lending modality, as it will \nenhance  continuity  and  predictability.  Long-term  engagement  of  consultants  and  DBO \ncontractors will be financed through multiple loans. Greater predictability of financing availability \nunder the MFF will enable the four towns to prepare the MFF tranches and investment in \naccordance with the road map beyond ADB\u2019s country programing period. It will provide a clear \nfinancial envelope in advance, and allow them to graduate from a traditional mode of planning\u2014\npreparing a project after budget is sanctioned. Greater continuity and predictability will enable \nthe state government to plan and execute investment in a holistic manner. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the investment program will be improved access to water supply and \nsanitation facilities by the urban population of the relatively poor and weak capacity state of \nBihar. The expected outcome will be access to better quality and sustainable urban water \nsupply and sewerage service for people, especially vulnerable households,12 in Bhagalpur, \nDarbhanga, Gaya, and Muzaffarpur. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  To provide access to better quality and sustainable urban water supply and sewerage \nservices, the investment program will deliver five outputs: \n(i)  Water  supply  infrastructure  in  three  towns  improved.  As  an  immediate \nsolution to the problem of inadequacy of new investment, new raw water intakes, \nclear water pumping mains, water treatment plants, overhead tanks, distribution \nnetworks, and water meters will be developed and procured in Bhagalpur under \ntranches 1 and 2, and Darbhanga and Gaya under tranche 3. \n(ii)  Sewerage infrastructure in one town improved. To address inadequacy of \nnew investment,  new house connections, sewer networks, pumping stations, \nsewage treatment plants, and maintenance equipment will be developed and \nprocured in Muzaffarpur under tranche 3. \n(iii)  O&M of assets created by subprojects improved. To address deficiencies in \nthe number and skills of O&M staff, DBO contractors will construct and operate \nall major infrastructure. They will field additional O&M staff13 and provide on-the-\njob training to ULB staff for at least 5 years under tranche 4. Permanent ULB \nstaff  under  the  municipal  civil  servant  system  will  take  in-country  technical \ncourses to upgrade their qualifications for asset operation. \n(iv)  Urban service delivery management improved. To introduce metered user \ncharges,  computerized  billing,  and  reserve  accounts  for  water  supply  and \nsewerage, the consultants under the investment program will prepare long-term \nbusiness  plans,  user  charge  plans,14 and  proposals  for  creating  water  and \nsewerage accounts for consideration and adoption by the ULBs. \n                                                \n12 The project preparatory TA report recognizes more \u201cvulnerable households\u201d as those fulfilling five or more of the \nfollowing criteria: (i) household belongs to most backward communities, (ii) head of household is a woman,  \n(iii) head of household is illiterate, (iv) head of household is working as a daily wage laborer, (v) household income \nis below the poverty line, and (vi) household is residing in a kutcha (dried mud) house. Nine percent of households \nheaded by women included in the sample of the TA study fall within the category of \u201cvulnerable households\u201d \nrequiring subsidies for connections. \n13 According to the assessment of the project preparatory TA, the current number of O&M staff is about one fifth of \nthe number required for internationally accepted staffing practice. The subprojects will explore a cost-effective and \nvalue-for-money solution by asking the DBO contractor to provide qualified staff at a competitive price. \n14 The state government, with the suport of the investment program management consultants, will explore a user \ncharge plan that gives concessionary rates for socially vulnerable groups, before completion of the asset creation \nunder the investment program. \n ", "5 \n(v)  Project  management  and  implementation  skills  and  transparency \nimproved. To enhance accountability of the executing agency to the financers \nand  Bihar  residents  and  to  strengthen  the  implementing  agency\u2019s  contract \nmanagement and subproject formulation, teams of consultants will provide the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  with  support  and  on-the-job  training \nthrough day-to-day collaboration. \n \nD.

Specific arrangements. Reflecting lessons learned from the past water supply and \nsewerage  projects  in  India,  large  international  competitive  bidding  contracts19 that  cover \nconstruction of substantial parts of water supply systems or a sewage treatment plant on a DBO \nbasis will be proposed for each subproject to achieve clear accountability for functioning of the \nsystem or the plant. Under one contract, a contractor will design, construct, and operate the \nasset for about 9\u201314 years (up to 1 year for design, up to 3 years for construction, and 5\u201310 \nyears for operation). One loan may cover the whole design and construction periods of a DBO \ncontract, and another loan(s) may continue to finance a part of the operation period of the same \ncontract up to the initial 3 years.20 The employer will continue to finance and administer the \nremaining duration of the contract after ADB loans are closed. In the final year, of the contract,  \nimplementing agency, the employer of the contractor, will have options to transfer responsibility \nfor  operation to the  ULB,  to  continue  engaging the  same  operator,  or  to  engage  another \noperator through the state procedure. \n \n20.  To ensure continuity and consistency, the two consulting service contracts will be carried \nout by the same team throughout the entire implementation period of the investment program \nfrom 2012 to 2021. The initial loan will cover the consulting service contracts for the first  \n5 years, while subsequent loans will cover the remaining period of the contracts. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  Engagement of an adequate number of qualified O&M staff is key to achieving and \nsustaining the service targets. Based on international and national norms for the number of staff \nnecessary to operate water supply and sewerage systems at common international standards, \nthe project preparatory TA estimates the optimal number of staff for specific sizes of operations, \ncompared with the existing number of staff. The results suggest each water supply system in \nBhagalpur, Darbhanga, and Gaya requires more than 100 additional qualified staff, and the new \nsewerage  system  needs  65  new  qualified  staff.  However,  immediately  creating  additional \npositions and filling vacancies in the ULBs would be difficult, because of the cap on the creation \nof new posts and modest remuneration. In such circumstances, operations by the contractors \nthrough a DBO contractual arrangement will be the most  practical option for engaging an \noptimum number of staff to efficiently operate the systems. Section 191 of the Bihar Municipal \nAct (2007) allows ULBs to entrust O&M and billing to an agency. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The economic analysis reviewed21 the following aspects of the investment program:  \n(i) the economic rationale for government intervention, (ii) goals, (iii) sector development plans, \n(iv) associated economic policies, (v) economic risks, (vi) the capacity of the state government, \n(vii) fiscal impact, (viii) state government\u2019s commitment, (ix) coordination of foreign aid, and  \n(x) conditions attached to the loan. The economic rationale for government intervention is \njustified as the investment program supports basic public services characterized by monopolistic \nconditions  and  management  of  externalities.  To  ensure  the  achievement  of  economy  and \n                                                \n19 The subproject on capacity building for Bihar urban infrastructure development under ADB. 2009. Technical \nAssistance Cluster to India on Advanced Project Preparedness for Poverty Reduction. Manila (TA 0003-IND) will \nhelp the implementing agency prepare the first DBO bidding documents. \n20 At least 3 years are expected to be required from commissioning of the new and/or renewed assets to achieve \nadequate user charge collection efficiency. To support the potential shortfall in revenue from the user charges, loan \nfinancing of the operation period for up to 3 years is proposed. \n21 Analysis on the investment program was carried out in accordance with D. Dole. 2005. Assessing Aid for a Sector \nDevelopment Plan: Economic Analysis of a Sector Loan. ERD Technical Note. No. 14. Manila: ADB (November). \n ", "8 \nefficiency in implementation of the investment program, each PFR will assess the demand and \nleast-cost designs, and ensure that the economic internal rates of return are higher than the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital, as specified in the subproject selection criteria of the FFA. \nThe economic internal rate of return for the Bhagalpur water supply subproject under project 1 is \nestimated at 18.3%. \n \n23.  Currently, no ULB levies user charges for water supply in Bihar. No sewerage service is \nprovided. National and state policies and laws encourage implementation of user charges for \nO&M on a cost-recovery basis.22 The investment program will first aim at (i) O&M cost recovery, \nand (ii) accumulation of internal reserves for the major expansion in 2026 of water supply and \nsewerage operations gradually after the assets are renewed and created. Establishment of \naccounts specific to water supply and sewerage operations in the ULBs will create a legal basis \nfor  dedicating  the  revenues  to  accumulate  internal  reserves.  Each  PFR  will  include  an \nassessment of indicative user charge proposals, which will be a broad guide for setting the \nexact rates for different consumer categories before the assets are operated. The financial \ninternal rate of return for the Bhagalpur water supply subproject under project 1 is minus 2.0%, \nbut the revenue from the user charge will ensure O&M cost recovery in each year. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  Bihar  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Corporation  (BUIDCo),  the  implementing \nagency,  will  have  the  most  involvement  in  day-to-day  financial  transactions  under  the \ninvestment  program.  BUIDCo  is  a  state  government  undertaking,  registered  under  the \nCompanies Act 1956 in June 2009. As a corporate body, BUIDCo has flexibility in adopting \nprofessional approaches to management and administration. Its financial management follows \nthe general practice of the private sector, and no major issue was highlighted in the financial \nmanagement assessment. The procurement capacity assessment23 indicates that BUIDCo has \nno experience in implementing an externally funded project but has satisfactory strength for \nmanaging the ongoing procurement activities of 23 national- and state-funded projects.24 It \nwould need additional technical staff and training on ADB\u2019s procurement procedures to cope \nwith  the  additional  contracts,  which  will  be  more  complex  and  larger  in  size  under  the \ninvestment program. As such, ADB will take cautious steps: \n(i)  Each tranche under the MFF will be processed as a project loan. The scope of \nproject 1 includes only one investment subproject to gradually build up capacity \nfor contract management and construction supervision. \n(ii)  ADB will conduct prior reviews of all procurement documents during project 1. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Urban Development and Housing Department. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual \n(footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The investment program will support ongoing and future national and state poverty \nreduction programs in four towns by improving the access of poor and non-poor households to \nwater supply and sanitation. It will provide water supply connections to the edge of slums, \n                                                \n22 ADB learned from past urban development projects in India that ULBs are able to adopt the government\u2019s urban \nreform agenda only after the beneficiaries see visible improvements in service delivery, and therefore coupling \nreforms with physical investments for service delivery improvements is important. \n23 Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 The list and size of contracts are available at http://buidco.bih.nic.in/projects-current.htm. \n ", "9 \nenabling slum dwellers to access safe water. Sustained access to safe water and sanitation can \nsignificantly decrease cases of water- and vector-borne diseases and have a positive impact on \npublic health. \n \n27.  An equally significant impact of the investment program is the reduction of time spent by \nwomen procuring water, disposing of waste, and caring for the sick, thus, freeing women to \nengage in other productive activities. Project 1 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \nThe gender action plans for the investment program and project 1 were prepared, outlining \nactivities  that  will  bring  about  equitable  access  to  water  supply  and  sewerage  services \nparticularly  to  vulnerable  and/or  households  headed  by  women  through  a  concessionary \narrangement for user charges, and promoting the participation of women in the project offices \nand among contractors and operators. Works contracts under projects will follow the core labor \nstandards, and require the contractors to carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for laborers \nas a part of the health and safety measures. Contracts for international competitive bidding and \nthe standard bidding documents for national competitive bidding require contractors to provide \nadequate measures for social impact mitigation in compliance with the FFA, loan and project \nagreements, and the principles of the International Federation of Consulting Engineers under \nthe supervision of the executing and implementing agencies, and ADB monitoring. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Safeguard  frameworks,  specifically  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework, a resettlement framework, and an indigenous peoples planning framework, were \nprepared for the investment program. Consistent with the safeguard frameworks, an initial \nenvironmental examination and a resettlement plan were prepared for project 1. Project 1 is \ncategorized as B for environment, B for involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. \nProject  1  will  provide  safe  drinking  water  to  the  residents  of  Bhagalpur.25 Most  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  are  associated  with  construction  and  will  be  mitigated.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination, which includes an environmental management plan, was prepared \nfollowing the environmental assessment and review framework. No land acquisition is required \nfor project 1, but a resettlement plan was prepared to address temporary impacts associated \nwith rehabilitation and laying of pipes, following the resettlement framework. No indigenous \npeoples were identified in project 1 sites; this is supported by census data and confirmed \nthrough  focus  group  discussions  and  transect  walks  during  subproject  preparation. \nConsultations were held with stakeholders and safeguard documents were disclosed in ADB\u2019s \nwebsite;  summaries  were  disclosed  in  local  language  to  affected  persons  and  other \nstakeholders. A community and participation plan details consultations and disclosure to be \nundertaken during project implementation. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \n                                                \n25 Tranche 2 is likely to finance construction of the raw water intakes in Bhagalpur. BUIDCo is currently assessing two \noptions\u2014one location is in the wildlife sanctuary (potentially category A for environment) and the investment and \nO&M costs will be less, while the other option is outside the wildlife sanctuary (potentially category B for \nenvironment), but the investment and O&M costs will be substantially higher. If the former option is selected, \nBUIDCo will prepare an environmental impact assessment, and disclose it on ADB's website at least 120 days \nbefore the approval of tranche 2. The Urban Development and Housing Department will submit the second PFR \nonly after disclosure of the environmental impact assessment on ADB's website; approval of the second PFR will \nbe after the 120-day disclosure. \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nUrban local bodies (ULBs)  The investment program will assist ULBs in designing affordable tariffs for O&M \ncannot pay design\u2013build\u2013operate  cost recovery and establishing dedicated accounts for O&M under the investment \ncontractors for operation and  program.

ASSURANCES \n30.  The government and the state government have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n31.  The government and the state government have given ADB certain undertakings for the \nMFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by the government and the \nstate government with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan \nagreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $200,000,000 to India for the Bihar Urban Development Investment \nProgram, from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the framework financing \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n7 March 2012 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nUrban population in  By 2021, populationb with  Service quality compliance  The state government \nrelatively poor and weak  access to 24x7 water  reportsd from operator and  continues to commit to \ncapacity state (Bihar) has  supply increased from 0 in  third party validator.  water supply and \nimproved access to water  2010 to 533,000.
