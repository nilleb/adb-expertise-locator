Northern Arc Capital Limited (NACL), formerly IFMR Capital Limited, was founded by \nDvara Trust (formerly IFMR Trust) in 2008. Its holding in NACL was through IFMR Holdings \nPrivate Limited. Multiple rounds of equity infusions included participation from investors in the \noperating company (NACL) and the holding company (IFMR Holdings). In early 2019, NACL \nundertook a corporate restructuring exercise, where the shares of the holding company were \nmerged with those of the operating company. The reorganization resulted in no significant control \nof the company by any shareholder. The company, therefore, does not have any identifiable \npromoter and is a professionally managed company governed by its board of directors and \nshareholders. NACL had a large equity round of \u20b99.1 billion in March 2019, when a few existing \nshareholders of the company took a partial exit1 and the company received a fresh capital infusion \nof \u20b94.0 billion. NACL further raised \u20b92.5 billion during FY2020 from the existing investors and \nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC). \n \nTable 1: Northern Arc Capital Limited Shareholding Structure as of FY2020 \nName of Equity Shareholders  Fully Diluted Shareholding  \nDvara Trust  10.0% \nAccion Africa-Asia Investment Company  6.0% \nLeapfrog   23.3% \nEight Roads Capital Investments*  10.6% \nAugusta Investments II Pte Limited*  18.3% \nIIFL Special Opportunities Fund*  26.4% \nSMBC  5.4% \nESOP pool  0.0% \nTotal  100.00% \n  ESOP = Employee Stock Ownership Plan, SMBC = Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. \n* Eight Roads, Augusta Investments II Pte Limited, and IIFL Opportunities Fund hold equity shares and \nCompulsory Convertible Preference Shares.  \nSource: Northern Arc Capital Limited.  \n \nB.

NACL  has  set  up  three  management  committees  for  credit,  asset  and  liability \nmanagement, and finance to conduct the daily operations of the business. \n \n5.  Credit committee. Composed of five members, including the CEO, chief finance officer \n(CFO), chief risk officer (CRO), chief legal officer, and head of operations and accounts. The \ncommittee approves the onboarding of each client (approval has to be unanimous) and each \ntransaction undertaken by NACL. \n \n6.  Finance committee. Composed of five members, including three board members, the \nCEO, and the CFO. The committee meets quarterly to approve the company\u2019s borrowings and \nreview the performance of the asset and liability management committee. \n \n7.  Asset and liability management committee. Composed of four members, including the \nCEO, CFO, CRO, and the head of operations and accounts. The committee meets monthly and \nsupervises the company\u2019s asset and liability management and structural liquidity. \n \nD.  Risk Management \n \n8.  NACL follows an integrated risk management approach to evaluate the complete credit \ncycle, from onboarding to monitoring. NACL approaches its risk management by monitoring \nportfolio, partner or client entity, and transaction risks. NACL uses the underlying data pool \navailable from 250+ underwritten securitization transactions, with close to 6 million contracts, to \nselect pools and target any market or sector for new product launches or take co-lending \nexposures. Any sector onboarded for an exposure undergoes 12\u201318 months of evaluation along \nwith  two  or  three  originators  from  that  sector,  with  the  company\u2019s  board  having  the  final \nresponsibility for approving the onboarding based on the evaluation data. Similarly, before \nonboarding an originator, the company undertakes extensive due diligence before the same is \nplaced before the management credit committee, whose unanimous approval is required. \n \n9.  NACL follows a sector-specific underwriting policy and has a three-stage process for \nappraising any on\u2013 or off\u2013balance sheet exposures: (i) identification of clients and their portfolio \nbased on the track record of the industry, the product, and the geography in which they operate; \n(ii) detailed analysis of the pool of ultimate borrowers (socioeconomic and demographic details, \nrepayment and prepayment history, loan status, and portfolio seasoning); and (iii) transaction-\nlevel risk assessment based on simulated risk models. Before approving a transaction, NACL \nuses three different types of risk analytics to model possible transaction loss estimation, credit \nvalue at risk and impact on economic capital, and simulated stress testing to assess possible \n ", "5 \ntransaction and overall portfolio stress scenarios. This thorough analysis of clients before the \ntransaction  is  supported  with  direct  portfolio  monitoring,  where  NACL  employees  visit  the \nbranches of their portfolio companies to assess on-ground realities and possible early signals of \nstress and changes in market dynamics. NACL defines its counterparty exposure framework in \naccordance with its credit management policy, which stipulates the maximum limit of \u20b91.5 billion \nor the ceilings as per the size of the counterparty\u2019s portfolio. NACL exercises significant prudence \nin taking exposure toward entities, based on its experience in institutional financing since FY2008. \nNACL\u2019s exposure toward its partner or clients is summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Portfolio Size Exposure Limits for Originators and Exposures as of FY2020 \nPortfolio Size    Average  Median  Average \nof Originator  Exposure   Exposure   Exposure \n(\u20b9 million)  Exposure Ceiling  (\u20b9 million)  (\u20b9 million)  (% of AUM) \nUp to 1,000   50%  85.3  68.5  24.6 \n1,000\u20133,000  Higher of 40% or \u20b9500 million  299.5  269.9  17.6 \n3,000\u20135,000  Higher of 30% or \u20b91,200 million  418.9  349.3  10.2 \n>5,000  Higher of 20% or \u20b91,500 million  502.1  403.0  4.7 \nAUM = Assets Under Management, FY = Fiscal Year \nSource: Northern Arc Capital Limited. \n \n10.  The board\u2019s risk management committee is responsible for setting policy, while the CRO \ndirectly reports to the committee. The committee meets every quarter to review the company\u2019s \nportfolio and each originators\u2019 exposure limits. Pardhasaradhi Rallabandi, the CRO, reports \ndirectly to the board committee. He has over 20 years\u2019 experience across banking functions and \nheads a team of 24 people, divided between an 8-member team focusing on risk modelling and \nanalytics and a 15-member team undertaking monitoring and surveillance. The monitoring team \nis divided into sectors, with each sector team responsible for periodic visits to each client and for \nthe conduct of sector risk analysis. A sector-wide credit team in the monitoring group carries out \nexposure and entity reviews. The modelling and analytics division has developed custom models \nbased on the securitization data to deepen understanding of portfolio and different asset classes \nand help quantify risk assessment. \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20200930155337+08'00'", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word for Microsoft 365", "ModDate": "D:20210106145204+08'00'", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Word for Microsoft 365", "Title": "RRP: Ownership, Management, and Governance"}}
