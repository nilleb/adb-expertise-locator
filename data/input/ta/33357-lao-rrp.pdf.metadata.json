An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy  matrix  is \nAssessment  available as Supplementary Appendix A. \n   \nRationale  Although  annual  economic  growth  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR)  has  averaged  nearly  6%  in  recent  years, \ncontributing to a reduction in the poverty rate from 45% in 1992/93 to \n32%  in  2002/03,  this  growth  has  been  unevenly  distributed.  Rural \ninhabitants comprise 72% of the total population, but about 90% of the \ncountry\u2019s poor live in rural areas. Maintaining high growth rates in the \nrural  sector  will  be  a  critical  factor  in  achieving  the  Government\u2019s \ndevelopment and poverty reduction goals. \n \nA dynamic rural economy requires sustainable, market-oriented rural \nand  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  that  can  intermediate  between \nsavers  and  borrowers,  efficiently  allocate  resources,  and  facilitate \nproduction and  the  exchange  of  goods  and  services.  However,  the \noutreach of formal financial services remains extremely low. Per its \nrecords,  the  Agriculture  Promotion  Bank  (APB)  provides  credit  and \nsavings services to about 120,000 (or 14%) of the country\u2019s estimated \n900,000 households. However, a survey of 1,189 households done in \nearly 2004 indicated that only 1.95% had borrowed from APB in the \nprevious 12 months, confirming that the bulk of APB\u2019s current clients \nare urban. MFIs are virtually nonexistent, and the four largest reach \nonly 6,000 clients collectively. Savings mobilization is also low. Less \nthan 15% of households have a savings account in the formal sector, \nand over 90% of savings in formal financial institutions are held by \nurban clients. \n \nAlthough the Lao PDR faces special challenges due to its dispersed \npopulation and limited infrastructure, which adds to the cost of financial \nintermediation, institutional weaknesses and Government policies have \ncontributed to low outreach of the sector. APB has primarily channeled \nGovernment and aid funds to targeted clients at subsidized interest \nrates. Management autonomy and responsibility have been limited, and \nAPB\u2019s financial performance has been poor. APB\u2019s outreach has been \nlimited because its losses have prevented it from building up its own \ncapital, Government and aid financing are limited, and APB\u2019s weak \nfinancial condition has prevented it from mobilizing commercial funding. \nAPB\u2019s  subsidized  interest  rates  have  also  crowded  out  MFIs  and \n ", "iv \ncontributed to  unrealistic  expectations  regarding  sustainable,  market \ninterest rates. Moreover, the lack of a clear and supportive legal and \nregulatory framework has discouraged many microfinance practitioners \nfrom  investing  in  the  sector.  Policy  and  institutional  reforms  will  be \nnecessary for rural and microfinance to achieve its potential to catalyze \ngrowth and reduce poverty in the Lao PDR. \n   \nProgram Loan  The goal of the Rural Finance Sector Development Program (RFSDP) \nObjective  is to assist the Government to reduce poverty and promote sustainable \neconomic growth in rural areas. RFSDP will contribute to this goal by \nachieving its objective to promote a sustainable and market-oriented \nrural and microfinance sector. It will assist the Government to improve \nthe  sector\u2019s  performance,  including  reducing  transaction  costs \nassociated  with  delivery  of  financial  services,  and  thereby  increase \nsustained access to financial services by the rural poor and micro, \nsmall,  and  medium-size  enterprises.  Rural  finance  clients  will  have \nopportunities to increase incomes and employment and improve their \nquality of life through access to strengthened, sustainable, and more \nresponsive rural and microfinance services that support investment and \nproduction. The increased access to capital will encourage farmers, \nnonfarm rural households, and agribusinesses to invest and create job \nopportunities. \n   \nComponents and  The program loan has four components: (i) creating an enabling policy \nOutputs  framework for public and private provision of rural and microfinance \nservices; (ii) creating a sound prudential regulatory and supervisory \nenvironment for public and private rural and microfinance institutions; \n(iii) transforming APB into a financially self-sustainable, market-oriented \nrural finance institution; and (iv) creating a supportive nonprudential \nregulatory  environment  for  rural  and  microfinance.  Specific  policy \nmeasures and outputs will include adoption of a new national policy for \nthe  rural  finance  sector;  reforms  in  APB  to  transform  it  into  a \nsustainable, market-oriented rural finance institution, including greater \ntransparency, improved governance, and phasing out policy lending; \nperformance-based recapitalization of APB; an improved supervision \nregime for APB; and enabling, best-practice regulations for MFIs. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $7.684 \nmillion equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe  Program.  The  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  24  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. An interest rate of 1% per annum \nwill be charged during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nProgram Period and  The proposed program loan will be released in three tranches. The first \nTranching  tranche of $2.7 million equivalent will be released on loan effectiveness; \nthe second tranche of $2.5 million equivalent about 15 months after the \nfirst tranche; and the third tranche of $2.484 million equivalent about \n18 months after the second tranche, subject to compliance with the \nconditions for their release. \n   \n \n ", "v \nExecuting Agency  The Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) will be the Executing Agency for the \nand Implementation  RFSDP and will oversee compliance with the reform program. BOL will \nArrangements  implement the program components that fall within its responsibility. \nAPB will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for its program component. \nOther  ministries,  committees,  and  agencies  responsible  for \nimplementing  of  nonprudential  reforms  will  be  IAs  for  their  policy \nmeasures. \n   \nProject Loan  The project loan\u2019s objective is to promote a sustainable and market-\nObjective and  oriented  rural  and  microfinance  sector.  It  will  (i)  build  BOL\u2019s  MFI \nComponents  supervision capacity; (ii) build capacity in APB in the areas of credit and \nrisk  management,  accounting,  and  management  information  system \n(MIS) in support of implementing its restructuring plan; and (iii) upgrade \nAPB\u2019s information and communications technology (ICT) system. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a loan of $2.316 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds resources, with a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of \n8  years.  The  annual interest  charge  will  be  1.0%  during the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter. The Financial Sector Reform Strengthening \nInitiative  (FIRST)  will  provide  parallel  cofinancing  of  $281,000  on  a \ngrant basis for the BOL MFI supervision component. \n   \nExecuting Agency  BOL  will  oversee  and  coordinate  project  implementation  and  will \nand Implementation  implement the MFI supervision component. APB will be the IA for the \nArrangements  APB restructuring and ICT upgrading components. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be \nsubject  to  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines. \nDisbursement procedures will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook \non Loan Disbursements.  \n   \nConsulting   Consultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be \nServices  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod.  A  total  of  42  person-months  of  ADB-financed  international \nconsulting  services  and  72  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices will be required under the project. An additional 12 person-\nmonths of international consulting services for the BOL MFI supervision \ncomponent will be financed by FIRST on a parallel grant basis and will \nfollow FIRST\u2019s guidelines. \n   \nJFPR Grant  In association with the project, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR) approved a grant of $1.98 million for Catalyzing Microfinance for \nthe Poor. The JFPR grant will create a microfinance fund (MFF) and \nestablish and build capacity in a Microfinance Fund Management Unit \n(MFFMU) to make matching grants for seed capital, equipment, and \ncapacity building in new and young MFIs that focus on sustainability \nand poverty reduction. The project will also disseminate microfinance \nbest practice through workshops and training for MFI practitioners and \nGovernment  officials.  Consulting  services  (46  person-months \ninternational and 53 domestic) will be required. \n ", "vi \n   \nJFICT Grant  In association with the project, the Japan Fund for Information and \nCommunications Technology (JFICT) approved a grant of $472,000 for \nupgrading ICT and MIS at the APB. The JFICT grant will assist APB to \n(i)  upgrade  its  ICT  human  resources\u2019  capacity  to  manage  the  ICT \nsystems upgrade; (ii) review and confirm the systems specifications; \n(iii) plan and execute the bidding, selection, and contracting processes \nwith  the  turnkey  contractor;  (iv)  monitor  the  turnkey  installation; \n(v) prepare and carry out a training plan; (vi) review and evaluate the \neffectiveness of technical and operational training provided under the \nturnkey contract; and (vii) plan and implement the rollout of systems to \nthe  whole  APB  branch  network.  Consulting  services  of  11  person-\nmonths (5 international and 6 domestic) will be required. \n   \nBenefits and  At  a  macroeconomic  level,  the  Program  will  result  in  a  deepened \nBeneficiaries  financial sector and greater financial intermediation that will, in turn, \nresult in a more efficient allocation of resources. The phasing out of \npolicy lending from APB will enable the Government to realize much-\nneeded budgetary savings; and the transfer of residual policy lending, if \nany,  to  an  on-budget  mechanism  will  increase  transparency  and \nimprove monitoring, thus enabling the Government to better assess the \ncosts and benefits of such lending. Indirectly, the stimulus to enterprise \ncreated through enhanced outreach of credit will result in increased \ninvestment  and  job  creation.  The  increased  outreach  of  savings \nservices will encourage monetization. \n \nMicrofinance providers and sponsors will benefit from the Government\u2019s \nadoption of an enabling and transparent regulatory and supervisory \nregime.  The  formalization  of  the  microfinance  sector  will  act  as  a \nstimulus to private investment in the sector. \n \nFarmers, other rural inhabitants, and rural enterprises will benefit from \nimproved access to credit and savings services. Income benefits will \naccrue  through  intensification  and  expansion  of  production  and \nacquisition of new technology. Business start-up and expansion will \nlead to job creation, for both the self-employed and wage earners. \n   \nSocial and  The  RFSDP  will  strengthen  the  rural  finance  sector  and  promote \nEnvironmental  sustainable delivery of financial services in rural areas. The improved \nIssues  policy and regulatory environment supporting rural and microfinance \ninstitutions will promote the establishment and operations of sustainable \nmicrofinance  and  other  rural  financial  institutions,  including  those \nestablished  by  the  private  sector  and  international  development \nagencies. These institutions will provide the rural poor with alternative \nand more affordable options compared with informal sources, which \noften charge monthly interest rates of 10% or higher. The RFSDP will \nfoster demand-driven, sustainable rural financial services. International \nexperience shows that the poor are willing to pay market interest rates \nand value-sustained access more than a subsidized interest rate. \n \n \n ", "vii \nRestructuring  APB  will  have  both  direct  and  indirect  positive  social \nbenefits.  Directly,  APB\u2019s  transformation  will  enable  it  to  increase \noutreach and contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction in \nthe Lao PDR. International and Lao experience have shown that the \nnon-poor are the primary beneficiaries of subsidized credit. APB\u2019s non-\nsubsidized, demand-driven expansion is therefore expected to benefit \nthe poor disproportionately. Indirectly, phasing out directed lending and \ninterest rate subsidies from APB will free up scarce resources in the \nGovernment budget, which can contribute to better-targeted poverty \ninterventions and reductions in the Government deficit, thus contributing \nto macroeconomic stability. If residual policy lending is shifted to an on-\nbudget nonbanking mechanism, the enhanced transparency will allow \npolicy makers to better assess the costs and benefits of such lending. \n \nBased on the poverty and social impact assessment, no persons will be \nnegatively  affected  in  terms  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People. The review of \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  policy  interventions  under  RFSDP \nindicates  that  the  interventions  will  not  have  any  direct  adverse \nenvironmental impact. \n   \nRisks and Mitigating  The lack of sustained Government commitment to a market-oriented \nMeasures  rural finance sector is a significant risk, as is the possibility of delays in \nimplementation.  The  Government\u2019s  repeated  commitment  in  several \nkey policy and strategy documents in the past 2 years mitigates this \nrisk,  as  do  ongoing  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder  coordination,  and \ncapacity-building support that is built into the program. \n \nAPB  may  remain  vulnerable  to  loan  losses  as  it  undergoes  its \nrestructuring.  Safeguards  against  poor  performance  include \n(i) performance-based recapitalization; (ii) strictly enforced adherence \nto the APB governance agreement and sanctions for noncompliance; \n(iii) strengthened supervisory regime for APB; (iv) tightening of credit \nstandards and more rigorous credit appraisal through improved credit \npolicies  and  procedures  and  application  of  ICT  for  improving  risk \nmanagement; and (v) investment in capacity building for adoption of \nbest practices. \n \nThe  estimated  cost  of  implementing  the  Program  is  $19.2  million, \nincluding the direct costs of policy reforms and related investments. \nThis  cost  is  a  potential  burden  to  the  Government\u2019s  budgetary \nresources and management capacity. However, a number of mitigating \nmeasures  have  been  put  in  place  to  reduce  this  risk.  In  terms  of \nbudgetary resources, grant cofinancing amounting to $6.5 million from \nvarious sources has been mobilized to assist in financing the Program. \nThe Government will finance $12.7 million, of which $10 million will be \ncovered by the ADB program and project loans. Much of the remaining \n$2.7  million  takes  the  form  of  in-kind  contributions  from  the \nGovernment,  such  as  staff  time.  To  mitigate  the  risks  of  fiscal \nmanagement,  several  aid  agencies,  including  ADB,  International \nMonetary  Fund  (IMF),  World  Bank,  United  Nations  Development \n ", "viii \nProgramme (UNDP), and Swedish International Development Agency \n(Sida) have been and are supporting the Government in improving its \nfinancial management.  \n \nA major constraint to private participation in the rural and microfinance \nsector has been the unclear and adverse policy, legal, and regulatory \nframework. While the framework will be improved substantially, private \ninvestors  may  still  take  a  \u201cwait  and  see\u201d  approach  to  assess  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  effective  implementation  of  the  new \nframework. The RFSDP has put in place two mitigating measures. First, \npolicy  dialogue,  stakeholder  coordination,  and  public  awareness \ncampaigns will provide forums through which investor concerns can be \naired and addressed. Second, MFF financed by the JFPR grant will \ndirectly catalyze investment in the sector by providing TA and start-up \ngrants to MFIs that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable provision \nof microfinance services to the poor. \n   \nTechnical  TA will assist BOL and APB to implement key aspects of the program \nAssistance Grant  and  to  build  APB\u2019s  human  resources  capacity.  The  TA  will  help \n(i) coordinate and integrate rural and microfinance policy reforms and \nprogram implementation; (ii) carry through the policy lending phaseout \nplan and performance-based recapitalization of APB to ensure its full \ntransition  to  commercially  oriented  operations  within  3  years; \n(iii) formulate  and  document  a  simplified  mechanism,  policies,  and \nprocedures for residual on-budget policy lending; and (iv) assist APB to \nbuild  capacity  in  human  resources  management.  International \nconsulting services of 16 person-months will be required. The TA grant \nconsists  of  $700,000  comprising  $400,000  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding \nprogram and $300,000 from the Government of Denmark. \n \n ", "", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) two proposed \nloans  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Rural  Finance  Sector \nDevelopment Program (RFSDP), and (ii) a proposal to administer a grant from the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for catalyzing microfinance for the poor. The report also describes \na proposed technical assistance (TA) project for Program Management and Building Human \nResource Capacity in the Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB), including the administration by \nADB of the portion of the TA to be financed by the Government of Denmark, and a proposal to \nadminister  a  grant  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Information  and  Communications  Technology \n(JFICT) for upgrading the information and communications system of APB. If the Board approves \nthe proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTA and the administration of the Government of Denmark and JFICT grants. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n \n2.  The Macroeconomic Context. The Lao PDR\u2019s human development index rank (135 out \nof 175) is among the lowest in Asia. Annual economic growth has averaged 5.7% in recent \nyears, contributing to a reduction in the poverty rate from 45% in 1992/93 to 39% in 1997/98 and \nto about 32% in 2002/03.1 However, growth has been unevenly distributed. The lowest income \nquintile accounted for only 8% of total consumption in 1997/98, compared with 9.3% in 1992/93. \nIn contrast, the highest quintile accounted for 44.4% of total consumption in 1997/98, compared \nwith 38.4% in 1992/93. During this period, the Gini coefficient rose from 28.6 to 35.7. While this \ncoefficient is low relative to other countries in the region, its rise indicates that the benefits of \neconomic growth accrued more to the non-poor than to the poor. Correspondingly, during this \nperiod, real per capita consumption in the rural areas increased by 5.4% per year while urban \nconsumption increased by 9%. As a result, poverty also declined more rapidly in urban areas, \nleading to a rising disparity between urban and rural incomes. However, results from the Lao \nExpenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS) III indicate a reversal in this trend\u2014the drop in \npoverty between 1997/98 and 2002/03 has been largely attributed to the decline in the number of \nrural poor. In 1997, rural poverty was estimated as 50 % higher than in urban areas. As of 2003, \nthe incidence of rural poverty was estimated as 30% more than urban poverty.2  \n \n3.  Economic growth and poverty reduction have been hindered by occasional bouts of \nmacroeconomic instability. The Lao PDR began its transition to a market economy in 1986 with \nthe adoption of the New Economic Mechanism, under which the Government pursued a number \nof  important  reforms,  such  as  (i)  redefining  and  limiting  the  role  of  the  state  in  allocating \nresources, (ii) liberalizing prices and trade, (iii) introducing business legislation, (iv) transferring \nagriculture production to private households, (v) privatizing some state-owned enterprises, and \n(vi) establishing a two-tiered banking system. The reforms had a strong impact on the economy, \nand growth averaged over 6% in the initial years of the transition. Beginning in 1997, following \nthe Asian financial crisis, the Government pursued an expansionary fiscal policy financed by \ncentral bank credit. As a result, inflation increased to 130% in 1999, the kip depreciated sharply, \nand losses accumulated in the banks and enterprises. The authorities began a stabilization \nprogram  in  1999  and,  over  the  next  18  months,  re-established  a  stable  macroeconomic \n                                                 \n1  Lao Expenditure and Consumption Surveys (LECS) I (1992/93), II (1997/98), and preliminary results of LECS III \n(2002/03). Poverty analysis of LECS III is forthcoming. \n2  World Bank. 2003. Lao PDR Country Brief. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \nframework. Since 2000, the Government\u2019s macroeconomic management has been generally \nsuccessful, although the tenuous fiscal situation has kept the macroeconomic situation fragile. \nFrom mid-2002 to May 2003, inflation again rose (to 18% by May 2003), and the exchange rate \ndepreciated  due  to  fiscal  weaknesses.  However,  tighter  fiscal  control  has  stabilized  the \nexchange rate for the past year, and inflation declined to 6.5%.  \n \n4.  In this context, the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), adopted \nby the National Assembly in October 2003, emphasizes the promotion of sustainable, equitable \ngrowth to improve the quality of life and to eradicate basic poverty. NGPES stresses that socio-\neconomic development must be based on sound macroeconomic management and institutional \nstrengthening  and  balanced  between  economic  growth,  sociocultural  development,  and \nenvironmental preservation. The long-term objective is to sustain economic growth at an average \nrate of about 7%, considered to be the necessary rate for tripling per- capita income by 2020 and \nenabling the Lao PDR to graduate from the list of least developed countries. Development of a \nsustainable, market-oriented rural finance sector is identified as a key element to support the \nNGPES. \n \n5.  Poverty in Rural Areas. The rural population comprises 72% of the total population of \n5.5 million, and 80% of the workforce are engaged in agriculture.3 The contribution of the \nagriculture sector to the national gross domestic product (GDP) is 51%, while in the northern \nregion, agriculture accounts for more than 70% of GDP.4 Annual output varies because the \ncountry is dependent on rain-fed agriculture. While overall the country is self-sufficient in food, \nsome remote areas still face seasonal food shortages. \n \n6.  While rural poverty may have declined, some 90% of the country\u2019s poor continue to live in \nrural areas. Poverty is more prevalent in the remoter and more mountainous areas, where \naccess to fertile land, basic social services, transport, and communications is limited.5 The \nnorthern region has the highest incidence of poverty, estimated at 52.5% in 1997/98. Of the 72 \ndistricts  designated  as  very  poor,  40  are  in  the  northern  region.  Two  northern  provinces, \nOudomxay and Huaphanh, have a poverty incidence of over 70%, and there are 28 districts \nnationally, all in remote rural areas, where poverty incidence is over 70%. Annually, some 90,000 \npeople enter the labor force, mostly in rural areas, for whom employment opportunities are \nneeded.6  Maintaining  high  growth  rates  in  the  rural  sector  will  be  critical  in  achieving  the \nGovernment\u2019s development and poverty reduction goals.  \n \n7.  Demand for Rural Finance. The Government\u2019s definitions of rural and microfinance are \nsimilar  to  those  of  ADB.  Per  the  Government\u2019s  Policy  Statement  for  the  Development  of \nSustainable Rural and Micro Finance Sector, issued by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in November \n2003, microfinance \u201cmeans the provision of a broad range of financial services, such as cash \nbased credit, deposits, insurance, etc., to the poor, low-income households, and their micro-\nenterprises,\u201d and rural finance \u201cmeans the provision of a broad range of financial services, such \nas cash based credit, deposits, insurance, etc, to people and enterprises located in rural areas.\u201d \nIn  the  context  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  predominantly  rural  and  agriculture-based  economy, \nmicrofinance will generally (though not exclusively) be a subset of rural finance. \n \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2003.

A survey of 1,189 households carried out in early 2004 indicates that the demand for \nrural financial services in the Lao PDR is significant. The demand is high for credit to support \nagricultural production, livestock raising, nonfarm income-generating activities (including micro, \nsmall, and medium-size agribusiness), and household consumption; and for secure savings \nfacilities. The market is segmented in terms of income-generating activities common under \ndifferent agricultural systems practiced. Four farming systems predominate: \n \n(i)  Flatland rain-fed and irrigated farming systems are found close to the Mekong \nRiver and its tributaries. In these areas, cultivated land is used for lowland rice \nproduction in the wet season and for livestock grazing in the dry season.  \n(ii)  The  plateau  farming  system  is  found  on  the  Bolovens  plateau  (Attapeu, \nChampasack,  and  Sekong  provinces)  and  in  two  other  plateau  areas  in \nKhammuane and Xiengkhuang provinces. Under this system, commercial crops \nare increasingly produced, and cattle are grazed on the plains and in the forests.  \n(iii)  Upland farming systems are characterized by slash-and-burn practices, and are \ndominated by a single wet season crop, mainly upland rice. Cattle, pigs, and \npoultry are raised under extensive husbandry systems.  \n(iv)  The mountain farming system operates in remote villages. The system is also \nbased on slash-and-burn cultivation of upland rice on mountain slopes, with little \nor  no  production  surplus.  A  variety  of  other  crops  are  incorporated  into  the \nsystem, and livestock are more intensively managed than other systems.  \n \n9.  Households practicing these four farming systems reported borrowing for agriculture and \nother activities that are prevalent in their systems. The survey found that 48% of households \nborrowed from at least one source in the 12 months before the survey. Reported unmet demand \nwas also high, with many households reporting an inability to borrow sufficiently for common \nactivities in their farming systems\u2014unmet demand by rural households of KN32 trillion was four \ntimes  as  large  as  actual  borrowing  of  KN800  billion.  The  highest  level  of  reported  unmet \ndemand\u201335%  of  households\u2013occurred  in  remote  rural  areas,  followed  by  households  in \nprovincial capitals (34%), households in peri-urban areas (23%), and households in the rural \nMekong area (11%).7 Overall, 27% of households reported unmet credit demand in the 12 \nmonths  before  the  survey.  The  most  commonly  cited  activities  for  which  financing  was \ninadequate were rice production, animal raising, trade, and transport. \n \n10.  There is also a clear segmentation of the market by wealth level. Table 1 shows that the \nrural poor tend to rely on family, friends, and moneylenders more commonly than the less poor. \nAlthough only 7.7% of the richest rural households borrowed from a commercial bank in the last \n12 months, this still represents significantly greater access than that for the two poorest quartiles, \nof whom only 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively, borrowed from a commercial bank. This pattern \napplies to APB also, with 5.2% of the richest quartile borrowing compared with only 1.0% of the \npoorest quartile. Additional data indicate that the most common activities of the two poorest \nquartiles that faced unsatisfied demand for credit were agriculture and animal raising, while the \ntwo richest quartiles more commonly reported unsatisfied demand for credit to finance wholesale \nand retail trade. \n \n                                                 \n7 The survey strata do not correspond precisely to segmentation by farming system. The upland and mountain \nsystems are most prevalent in the remote rural stratum, while the flatland system is more common to the rural \nMekong area and, in some cases, the peri-urban areas. The plateau system, depending on location, could be in the \nupland or peri-urban areas. \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Access to Financial Services, by Wealth Quartile \n \nPoorest  2nd  3rd  Richest \nVariable \nQuartile  Quartile  Quartile  Quartile \nPercentage of households that borrowed in last 12 months  55.3  52.2  45.2  39.0 \nPercentage that borrowed from APB in last 12 months  1.0  1.4  3.1  5.2 \nPercentage that borrowed from any bank in last 12 months  1.7  1.4  4.2  7.7 \nPercentage that borrowed from a moneylender in last 12 months   5.2  3.1  0.3  2.8 \nPercentage that borrowed from family or friends in last 12 months   35.1  33.0  28.9  16.0 \nAPB = Agriculture Promotion Bank. \nSource: ADB/FIRST Survey of Rural Finance, Subproject 6 of TA cluster 3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development, \nFebruary\u2013March 2004. \n \n11.  There is also a strong demand for secure savings facilities that are easily accessible and \nretain their value. Across all wealth groups, the most valued characteristics of a savings vehicle \nwere (i) ability to retain or increase in value, with 35% citing this as an important characteristic; \n(ii) liquidity (30%); and (iii) safety (16%). However, savings mobilization in the formal sector is \nlow\u2014less than 15% of all Lao households have a savings account in the formal sector, and over \n90% of savings in formal financial institutions are held by urban clients. Only 5.8% of rural \nhouseholds surveyed in early 2004 held any savings in a bank, another 5.2% held savings in \nsemiformal financial institutions, and 2.1% held savings in informal rotating savings and credit \nassociations. Less than one third of cash savings and only about 2% of total savings in rural \nareas are deposited in the banking system. At the same time, 98% of households reported \nsavings in the form of livestock, 35% in the form of housing materials such as lumber, and 38% \nin the form of precious metals and jewelry; the poorest quartile hold 93% of their savings in kind. \nNonetheless, 50% of households surveyed reported that a bank would be their first or second \npreference as a savings vehicle, indicating large unmet demand for formal savings services.  \n \n12.  Supply of Rural Finance. Despite the high and varied demand, the financial sector in \nthe Lao PDR has a low level of outreach in rural areas. APB is the only formal financial institution \nwith significant outreach and service history in rural areas. It has a branch in each of the \ncountry\u2019s 17 provinces, a branch covering Vientiane Municipality, and subservice units in 55 of \nthe country\u2019s 141 districts.8 Per its records, APB provides credit and savings services to about \n120,000 (or 14%) of the country\u2019s estimated 900,000 households. However, the survey of 1,189 \nhouseholds done in early 2004 indicated that only 1.95% had borrowed from APB in the previous \n12 months, confirming that the bulk of APB\u2019s current clients are urban. \n \n13.  Since APB\u2019s creation in 1993, its operations have concentrated on providing subsidized \ncredit to producers of agricultural products (notably rice), livestock, and handicrafts. Its funding \nhas been provided by national and local government budget allocations, the Bank of Lao PDR \n(BOL, the central bank), and international development agencies. As of 31 December 2003, APB \nhad 60 such funding arrangements that financed 52% of its loan portfolio. Major aid-funded \ncredit  lines  still  outstanding  have  come  from  ADB  ($7  million),  the  Government  of  Japan \n($2 million in equipment), International Fund for Agriculture Development ($500,000), European \n                                                 \n8 Only Lao Development Bank (LDB) has a comparable branch network (with one branch per province), but \nconcentrates lending on small and medium-size enterprises in the provincial capitals. About 2,000 small savers and \nborrowers (or 0.25% of households) use LDB. The Banque pour le Commerce Ext\u00e9rieur du Laos (BCEL) generally \nconfines its lending to urban areas and focuses on financing trade and larger enterprises. Branches of several \nforeign banks started operating in Vientiane in the early 1990s, but deficiencies in the banking environment, \nparticularly the legal framework, and limitations on their activities have limited their contribution to the domestic \neconomy. \n ", "5 \nUnion ($200,000), and Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) ($40,000). \nThe remainder of its loan portfolio is funded from deposits. \n \n14.  In the semiformal sector, five initiatives that seek to provide microfinance services on a \nsustainable basis have only about 5,900 savers and 4,600 borrowers\u2015for the most part the \nsavings are compulsory deposits that partially guarantee borrowers\u2019 loans.  \n \n15.  In  addition  to  these  sustainably  focused  initiatives,  about  35  international  non-\ngovernment organizations (NGOs) and bilateral development agencies have supported small-\nscale credit initiatives in remote areas, largely through village funds. In some districts, these \nvillage funds are significant providers of financial services, representing the only source of credit \nother than family and friends. About 8,000 households have access to loans from village-based \nfunds. However, these funds have generally been an ancillary activity attached to projects with \nbroader  development  goals  and  have  not  focused  on  the  development  of  a  sustainable \nmicrofinance institution (MFI). They often become nonoperational after project support ends. A \nmajor role in the implementation of such projects has been played by the Lao Women\u2019s Union \n(LWU).  \n \n16.  In the informal sector, family and friends are consistently reported to be the primary \nsource of credit by most households, and borrowing from moneylenders is less common. In the \n2004 rural finance survey, 25% of households reported borrowing from a friend or family member \nin the previous 12 months, and 57% reported that they would first approach a friend or family \nmember if they needed a loan. In contrast, 1.95% reported borrowing from APB and 19% \nreported  that  they  would  first  approach  APB  if  they  needed  a  loan.  Only  2.14%  reported \nborrowing  from  a  moneylender,  and  only  1.9%  reported  that  they  first  would  approach  a \nmoneylender  if  they  needed  a  loan.  Appendix  1  gives  a  fuller  analysis  of  the  rural  and \nmicrofinance sector. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n17.  A dynamic rural economy is necessary to achieve the Government\u2019s poverty reduction \ngoals  and  requires  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural  and  microfinance  institutions  that  can \nintermediate  between  savers  and  borrowers,  efficiently  allocate  resources,  and  facilitate \nproduction and the exchange of goods and services. Lao PDR\u2019s rural finance sector faces \nsignificant constraints in fulfilling its potential to contribute to economic growth and poverty \nreduction. The Lao population in rural areas is highly dispersed, and limited infrastructure adds \nto the cost of financial intermediation and inhibits information flows for lenders and borrowers. \nThese factors combined with the small-scale nature of transactions pose serious challenges for \ndeveloping rural finance. Indeed, it is estimated that 20% of households live in such remote \nareas, with no road access at any time of the year, that it may be difficult to provide them with \nmicrofinance services on a sustainable basis. \n \n18.  In the absence of access to formal sources of credit, the poor continue to rely on informal \nsources of finance, including landlords, merchants, moneylenders, relatives, and friends. Loans \nfrom friends and family are usually interest-free, but sometimes carry interest rates common to \nmoneylenders. Typical interest rates charged by moneylenders, merchants, and other informal \nsources are 10% per month (120% per year) and can be as high as 40% per month. Alternative, \naffordable, and sustainable sources of rural financial services are therefore necessary to support \neconomic growth and poverty reduction in the rural economy.  \n \n ", "6 \n19.  Agriculture  Promotion  Bank.  The  Government's  policy  to  support  access  to  rural \nfinance has been implemented primarily by APB, which was established as a policy bank in 1993 \nand has acted as a channel for Government and aid funds and subsidies by carrying out policy \nlending  on  behalf  of  the  Government.9  APB\u2019s  interest  rates  on  policy  loans  have  been \ndetermined  by  either  the  Government  or  agreements  with  aid  agencies  and  other  funding \nsources. Typically, they are below market rates, as low as 7% per year, and insufficient to cover \nAPB\u2019s  costs.  APB\u2019s  ordinary  lending  is  funded  from  deposits,  with  lending  rates  closer  to \ncommercial terms (e.g., 20% for crops and livestock, 24% for handicraft, 26% for small industry, \n30% for trade and services, and 34% for overdrafts). These rates are set by APB\u2019s Board, but \nthey are not based on APB\u2019s actual risks. APB's outreach is limited because it depends on the \nlimited  funding  available  from  the  Government  and  aid  agencies  and  because  its  policies, \ninefficient and subsidized operations, and weak financial condition prevent it from mobilizing \ncommercial  funding.  Institutionally,  APB  carries  out  financial  and  nonfinancial  activities  (for \nexample,  distributing  fertilizer  and  equipment),  reflecting  its  mixed  mandate  as  a  financial \ninstitution and development organ of the state. As a result, its operations are inefficient, and \nmanagement autonomy and responsibility are limited. \n \n20.  Subsidized  interest  rates  and  the  common  practice  of  rolling  over  loans  have \nprevented APB from developing and adopting realistic credit risk assessment and loan pricing \npractices, and have contributed to a weak credit culture and high levels of non-performing loans \n(NPLs). Consequently, according to international accounting standards, APB has been operating \nat a significant loss since it was established in 1993. However, before 2002, APB had never \nbeen audited, making its financial situation (and, therefore, costs to the Government budget) \nunclear. APB\u2019s first audit, which took place in 2002, indicated a high rate of NPLs10 as of \nDecember  2001,  and  inadequate  provision  for  doubtful  debts.  APB\u2019s  portfolio  regrading \nundertaken as of 31 December 2003 indicates that the high NPL rate is driven largely by its \npolicy lending, which has an NPL rate that is 2.4 times higher than the NPL rate of its ordinary \nloan  portfolio.  APB  has  incurred  significant  losses  each  year  since  its  establishment, \nrepresenting costs to the Government budget. Loans of about KN82.5 billion (35% of APB\u2019s total \nportfolio) needed to be written off as of 31 December 2003. The amount comprised KN59.4 \nbillion in policy loans (52% of the policy lending portfolio) and KN23.2 billion in ordinary loans \n(26% of the ordinary portfolio). Since APB\u2019s establishment in 1993, about $1 million equivalent \nper year on average has been lost and losses have accelerated in recent years. Further analysis \nof APB\u2019s financial performance and projections is in Appendix 1 and Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n21.  Market reforms in APB are necessary to enable it to increase outreach sustainably \nwithout  burdening  the  Government  budget.  Moreover,  international  and  Lao  experience \ndemonstrate that the non-poor are the main beneficiaries of subsidized interest rates since they \nhave  greater  access  and  can  absorb  larger  loans.  Over  half  of  APB\u2019s  loan  portfolio  is \nconcentrated in the two wealthiest areas of the country\u2014Vientiane and Champasack. The 2004 \nsurvey of 1,189 households indicated that 77% of APB\u2019s borrowers in the sample were of above-\naverage wealth as measured by asset value; and 58% came from the provincial capital or peri-\nurban areas. In contrast, the poor were three times as likely to borrow from a moneylender. \nInternational experience has shown that when subsidized loans are not available, the poor are \nwilling to pay market interest rates, and they tend to value sustained access more than a low \ninterest rate. The 2004 survey bears this out for the Lao PDR too\u201446% of households in the \npoorest quartile cited \u201cconfidence that a loan will be made\u201d as an important characteristic in \nchoosing  where  to  apply  for  a  loan,  but  only  19%  cited  the  interest  rate  as  an  important \n                                                 \n9  Policy lending in the Lao PDR generally refers to directed credit at preferential interest rates. \n10  NPLs are loans on which repayment of principal or interest is overdue by more than 90 days. \n ", "7 \ncharacteristic. Therefore, developing a market-oriented rural financial system is the best way to \nprovide the poor with access to affordable financial services. Compared with informal interest \nrates, sustainable rates of 25-35% will mark a substantial improvement. \n \n22.  APB\u2019s  legal  status  is  somewhat  ambiguous.  It  was  established  by  prime  ministerial \ndecree no. 92/PM on 19 June 1993 as a development bank, with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nholding its shares. Per Article 5 of this decree, \u201cthe state budget encourages reduced lending \nrates and guarantees minimum prices of major agricultural products \u2026 so that farmers need not \nbe concerned with the marketing of their production\u201d. Per article 6, \u201cBOL \u2026 shall implement the \nrequired conditions concerning the establishment of this bank, to determine its organizational \nstructure, and to establish regulations governing the management and the action program of \nAPB, which will be submitted for approval of the Government.\u201d Presidential decree no. 02/PR on \nCommercial  Banks,  22  March  2000,  appears  to  bring  APB  largely  under  its  provisions, \nsuperseding  the  1993  establishment  decree.  However,  the  wording  of  this  decree  can  be \ninterpreted to leave APB\u2019s status as a \u201ccommercial\u201d or \u201cdevelopment\u201d bank uncertain; and in \neffect, APB has continued to be treated as a development bank, separate from the other state-\nowned commercial banks. As such, BOL has not conducted on-site supervision of APB and has \nnot required APB to comply with prudential ratios or to submit standard reports and information \nfor off-site supervision. APB has effectively gone unregulated and unsupervised by BOL since its \nestablishment. \n \n23.  Microfinance Institutions and Initiatives. Microfinance is at an embryonic stage in the \nLao  PDR.  The  combined  outreach  of  the  four  largest  initiatives  is  less  than  6,000.  APB\u2019s \noperations  have  tended  to  distort  the  rural  finance  system  and  result  in  misallocation  of \nresources, low deposit mobilization, and crowding out of MFIs and other banks\u2014further limiting \noutreach. They also create a climate of unrealistic expectations on the part of potential borrowers \nand central and local officials regarding the cost of credit, thus making it difficult for microfinance \ninitiatives to charge sustainable interest rates even in areas where APB\u2019s outreach is limited. \nVillage revolving funds established by the LWU in some 1,600 villages (sometimes with the \nsupport of international aid agencies) reinforce these expectations\u2014in general, they channel a \nlimited amount of subsidized credit to a few households, do not mobilize local resources, have \nlow repayment rates, and are not sustainable. It is unknown how many are still operational. \n \n24.  Projects  or  MFIs  that  attempt  to  charge  sustainable  interest  rates  are  typically \ndiscouraged or prevented from doing so by local officials. The lack of a clear legal and regulatory \nframework for microfinance gives MFI practitioners little recourse to counter interference from \nsuch officials. This lack of a transparent framework and the consequent interference are cited by \ninternational  NGOs  and  other  potential  microfinance  investors  as  the  main  reason  for  not \ninvesting in the sector. Current regulations (regulation no. 02/SB of 15 November 1994 issued by \nBOL) cover only credit cooperatives and provide limited or no guidance on operational rules of \ngovernance,  conflicts  of  interest,  auditing  requirements,  prudential  discipline,  reporting \nrequirements, sanctions, and experience or qualification of board members. In addition to the \nlack of a legal and regulatory framework for microfinance, BOL has no experience and only \nlimited capacity to supervise MFIs. Because of these constraints, very few MFIs operate in the \ncountry.  Most  microfinance  is  delivered  through  one-off  projects  and  other  unsustainable \ninitiatives, capacity is low, and accounting practices are weak or nonexistent. \n \n25.  Actions and Plans of the Government. Lao authorities have begun taking important \nsteps to improve the policy, regulatory, and institutional environment for rural and microfinance. \n ", "8 \nSince March 2000, ADB has been assisting the Government in its efforts under a TA cluster to \ndevelop rural finance.11 Given the nascent stage of the sector, subproject 1 of the TA cluster, \ncarried out in 2000/01, built awareness of rural finance issues, including international experience \nand best practice, through a series of workshops and study tours and prepared a policy and \nissues  paper  that  identified  weaknesses  in  the  institutional,  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory \nframework.  \n \n26.  To begin reforming APB, subproject 2 (May\u2013December 2002) conducted a diagnostic \nreview  and  financial  audit  of  APB.  Based  on  the  findings,  an  APB  restructuring  plan  was \nprepared (Supplementary Appendix C), which addresses weaknesses in APB's policies and \nprocedures in many areas, including governance, planning, organizational structure, pricing, \ncredit,  products  and  services,  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT),  risk \nmanagement, and accounting. Importantly, the restructuring plan includes phasing out policy \nlending from APB and shifting residual policy lending, if any, to a transparent, nonbanking \nmechanism on the Government budget. In November 2002, the Government adopted a new \ncorporate vision for APB to \"operate in a market-oriented, financially self-sustainable way to \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  the  country's  economic  growth  and  prosperity.\" \nImplementation of the first phase of the APB restructuring plan began in March 2003 under \nsubproject 5 and was completed in July 2004. In the first phase, restructuring activities were: \n \n(i)  planning for financial restructuring, including \n \n(a)  putting in place a 3-year rolling corporate planning process, \n(b)  preparing business plans and a financial modeling system, \n(c)  developing and implementing a systematic workout plan for NPLs,  \n(d)  preparing a plan to phase out policy lending and project-based credit lines, \n(e)  formulating  a  plan  for  compliance  with  prudential  regulations  and \nrecapitalization, \n(f)  defining a market-based pricing policy, and  \n(g)  simplifying the loan product line; \n \n(ii)  planning  for  organizational  restructuring  and  human  resources  best  practice, \nincluding \n \n(a)  revising the functions and responsibilities of APB\u2019s Board, \n(b)  preparing a plan to strengthen APB\u2019s organization, \n(c)  carrying out job analyses and preparing written job descriptions, and  \n(d)  conducting a training program to support restructuring;  \n \n(iii)  initiating basic risk management practices, including \n \n(a)  putting in place prudent loan classification and provisioning systems, and  \n(b)  defining new basic risk management and credit policies and procedures. \n \n27.  While  the  capacity  of  APB  is  being  developed  through  its  restructuring  program, \ninstitutional mechanisms involving the private sector are also being promoted under subproject 3 \nof the TA cluster, begun in March 2003, which established three pilot savings and credit unions \n(SCUs) in areas with strong market linkages. These SCUs are member-owned and managed, \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2000.

They  were  licensed  and  began \noperations in May and June 2004. \n \n28.  In addition, the Government's Rural and Microfinance Committee (RMFC), with support \nfrom  ADB,  Concern  Worldwide,  the  Financial  Sector  Reform  and  Strengthening  Initiative \n(FIRST), and the World Bank, prepared an official vision and policy statement for the sector, \nbased on a participatory process with key stakeholders, including villagers. The thrust of the \nPolicy Statement for the Development of Sustainable Rural and Micro Finance Sector12 is the \ndevelopment  of  a  market-oriented,  sustainable  sector,  which  includes  active  private  sector \nparticipation; removal of interest rate caps and subsidies; and development of an enabling policy, \nlegal, and regulatory framework. The Policy Statement was endorsed by a forum of provincial \nvice-governors and other senior Lao officials in June 2003, by BOL in August 2003, and by the \nPrime  Minister\u2019s  Office  in  November  2003.  Subproject  4  of  the  TA  cluster  (co-financed  by \nFIRST), begun in March 2003 and completed in May 2004, has sustained the momentum of the \nreform process by assisting the RMFC through a participatory process to develop a strategy to \npromote rural and microfinance development, and assisting BOL's Department of Supervision to \ndevelop an enabling legal and regulatory framework.13 \n \n29.  Lessons Learned. In addition to building on the recent achievements supported by the \nTA cluster, the program also incorporates lessons learned from previous assistance to the Lao \nPDR.14 Specifically, it emphasizes the need to ensure a sustainable, positive real interest rate \npolicy in APB by eliminating interest rate subsidies. Such subsidies are a drain on the national \nbudget  and  have  a  distorting  effect  on  markets  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategy to move toward an efficient market-oriented economy. The program, through a step-by-\nstep consensus-building approach initiated by the TA cluster, has also allowed for a longer lead \ntime  for  reform  measures  that  are  dependent  on  legislation  or  regulatory  changes.  This \nparticipatory approach has built in the Government a strong sense of ownership for the program, \nwhile simultaneously coordinating support from various aid agencies, including IMF, World Bank, \nbilateral agencies, and international NGOs. Information on external assistance and coordination \nin the financial sector is in Appendix 2. The program takes into consideration existing capacity \nconstraints in the staffs of executing agencies and implementing agencies by incorporating TA to \nbuild capacity and support implementation, and targeting TA at the appropriate technical level. \nImportantly, the program takes into account the unfavorable experience in recapitalizing the \nstate-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) under previous programs by addressing institutional \nweaknesses, credit policies and procedures, management autonomy, and workout of NPLs. \nMoreover, recapitalization of APB will be subject to strictly enforced performance criteria agreed \nupon by APB, BOL, MOF, and ADB. \n \n30.  The initial reforms and initiatives the Government has undertaken are important first \nsteps in developing sustainable, market-oriented rural and microfinance that can contribute to \ndeveloping the potential for agricultural and rural enterprises. However, a large portion of poor \nhouseholds remain outside the reach of formal financial institutions. To develop a sustainable, \n                                                 \n12  Available as Supplementary Appendix D. \n13   BOL\u2019s  draft  strategy  and  action  plan  and  draft  microfinance  regulations  are  available  as  Supplementary \nAppendixes E and F, respectively. \n14   ADB. 1999.

Improvements in the policy environment will \ninclude fostering competition among and market access for new MFIs, as well as facilitating their \nsustainable operation in a conducive supervisory and regulatory framework. BOL\u2019s capacity to \nimplement  this  framework  needs  to  be  strengthened.  Linkages  between  public  institutions, \nNGOs,  the private  sector,  and  other  financial  institutions  also  need  to  be  established in a \nsystematic manner. A more efficient, diverse, competitive, and market-oriented rural finance \nsystem will increase access to financial services and significantly expand income-generating \nopportunities, generate employment, and reduce poverty. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n31.  The goal of the Rural Finance Sector Development Program (RFSDP) is to assist the \nGovernment to reduce poverty and promote sustainable economic growth in rural areas. The \nRFSDP will contribute to this goal by promoting a sustainable and market-oriented rural and \nmicrofinance  sector.  A  systemic  response  is  necessary  to  develop  rural  and  microfinance, \nincluding policy reforms and institutional investments. The sector development program modality \nhas therefore been chosen to facilitate the adoption of sector reforms to ensure that an enabling \npolicy, legal, and regulatory framework is in place to enhance the effectiveness of strategically \nidentified investments. The RFSDP will assist the Government to improve the performance of the \nsector, including reducing transaction costs associated with delivery of financial services and \nthereby increase sustained access to financial services by the rural poor and operators of micro, \nsmall, and medium-size enterprises. Rural finance clients will have opportunities to increase \nincomes and employment and improve their quality of life through access to strengthened, \nsustainable,  and  more  responsive  services  that  support  investment  and  production.  The \nincreased  access  to  capital  will  encourage  farmers,  nonfarm  rural  households,  and \nagribusinesses to invest and create job opportunities. \n \n32.  The RFSDP comprises a program loan and a project loan. The program loan is based on \nthe first phase of the Government\u2019s draft long-term strategy and action plan to develop the \nsector. The RFSDP will support (i) development of an enabling policy framework for rural and \nmicrofinance;  (ii)  reforms  in  the  prudential  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework; \n(iii) development of a sustainable, market-oriented APB; and (iv) a supportive nonprudential \nregulatory  environment.  Key,  broad-based  policy  reforms  will  be  achieved  as  first-tranche \nmeasures, including adoption of a new national policy on rural and microfinance, issuance of \nmicrofinance regulations and other legal changes, and adoption of a governance agreement as \nthe basis for APB reforms.15 Second- and third-tranche measures will include key policy reforms \nas well as measures to institute regular monitoring and supervision mechanisms to receive \nfeedback on implementation of the reform program to make necessary course adjustments \nand/or keep the reform agenda on track. \n \n33.  The project loan comprises (i) support to BOL to build the capacity to implement the new \nregulatory and supervisory framework for microfinance; (ii) support for APB to strengthen its \nhuman resources, build its human resources management capacity, upgrade its accounting \nsystems, and improve its credit and risk management; and (iii) investment in upgraded ICT \n                                                 \n15 The governance agreement is available as Supplementary Appendix G. \n ", "11 \nsystems  for  APB  and  related  support  for  implementing  the  upgrade.  The  project  loan  is \nconsistent with the Program\u2019s objective and is required to help the Government achieve this \nobjective and to meet the significant but unfulfilled demand for rural and microfinance services. \nThe program framework is in Appendix 3, and the Government\u2019s development policy letter and \npolicy matrix are in Appendix 4. \n \nB.  The Program Loan \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n34.  The program loan will promote the development of a sustainable and market-oriented \nrural  and  microfinance  sector  by  helping  the  Government  implement  the  policy  reforms \nembodied in its strategy to promote the sector. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n \n35.  The program loan has four components:  \n \n(i)  Creating an enabling policy framework for public and private provision of rural and \nmicrofinance. \n(ii)  Creating a sound prudential regulatory and supervisory environment for public \nand private rural and microfinance institutions. \n(iii)  Transforming APB into a financially self-sustainable, market-oriented rural finance \ninstitution. \n(iv)  Creating  a  supportive  nonprudential  regulatory  environment  for  rural  and \nmicrofinance.  \n \n36.  The program loan will be released in three tranches: the first tranche is expected to be \nreleased in September 2006, the second in December 2007, and the third in June 2009. \n \na.  Creating an Enabling Policy Framework for Public and Private \nProvision of Rural and Microfinance \n \n37.  Throughout  2002  and  2003,  the  Government  carried  out  an  extensive  participatory \nprocess with key stakeholders to develop an enabling national policy on rural and microfinance. \nThis policy replaces the over reliance on subsidized, directed credit channeled through APB and \nencourages the establishment and operation of alternative sources of rural finance, including \nmicrofinance. The process resulted in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office\u2019s (PMO\u2019s) endorsement of the \nPolicy  Statement  for  the  Development  of  Sustainable  Rural  and  Micro  Finance  Sector  in \nNovember  2003.  The  Policy  Statement  presents  a  vision  that  (i)  the  sector  will  expand \nsignificantly; (ii) the sector will include a diversity of independent MFIs, including private and/or \npublic institutions with access to national and international public and private investors, including \ninternational donors and development partners; (iii) the sector will become sustainable, and \ninterest rates will be set by MFIs\u2019 management based on full cost recovery, profitability, and \nmarket  demand;  and  (iv)  the  environment  will  ensure  security  for  depositors,  including \nimplementation  of  an  appropriate  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and  strengthening  of \nsupervision of deposit-taking MFIs. \n \n38.  The Government is following up the development of the Policy Statement with a strategy \nand action plan for its implementation. The Government\u2019s RMFC will initiate a process of regular \nconsultations  with  key  stakeholders  to  conduct  policy  dialogue  and  to  review  progress  in \n ", "12 \nimplementing  the  Policy  Statement  and  strategy.  In  recognition  of  the  fact  that  rural  and \nmicrofinance is an integral part of the overall financial sector, the Government will incorporate \nrural finance in the financial sector strategy that will be prepared by June 2007. As a result, rural \nand microfinance development will shift from an ad hoc project approach to a coherent national \nstrategy that provides short-, medium-, and long-term direction, and has been and will continue \nto be participatory in its formulation, formalization, and implementation. This formal foundation \nwill create an enabling environment for deepening the rural and microfinance sector and will \nencourage domestic private participation in the sector. \n \nb.  Creating a Sound Prudential Regulatory and Supervisory \nEnvironment for Public and Private Rural and Microfinance \nInstitutions \n \n39.  Because of APB\u2019s historical role as a policy bank, it has effectively gone unsupervised by \nBOL. With its transformation into a market-oriented rural finance institution, APB will now be \nrecognized and treated as an SOCB and will therefore be subject to the prudential regulations \nand supervisory regime applicable to SOCBs. BOL will issue instructions to APB to comply with \nprudential regulations on loan classification and provisioning (including a category for special \nmention loans) starting October 2005 and to comply with all prudential regulations other than \ncapital adequacy and minimum capital requirements by December 2005. BOL will develop and \nimplement a supervisory regime of monthly off-site and semiannual on-site inspection of APB. \nAPB will undergo annual external audits according to international financial reporting standards \n(IFRS) and, beginning in 2006, will publish its IFRS financial statements. To ensure that APB, \nunder its status as an SOCB, can continue to conduct microfinance operations through group-\nlending arrangements, Article 65 of the Commercial Bank Decree will be amended to clarify that \ncollateral requirements for bank loans will abide by the rules and loan agreements set out by the \nbanks.16 \n \n40.  The lack of transparent and enabling regulations for microfinance has been a major \nreason for the lack of investment in MFIs and has resulted in arbitrary interference in MFI \noperations,  rendering  sustainability  difficult.  To  create  an  enabling  legal,  regulatory,  and \nsupervisory framework for microfinance, BOL will adopt and implement regulations, bylaws, \nguidelines, a chart of accounts, and accounting standards for MFIs based on best practice \nprinciples. The regulations will, for the first time in the Lao PDR, allow for multiple MFI models \nand products with minimum starting regulations, interest rate autonomy, and private ownership. \n \nc.  Transforming APB into a Financially Self-Sustainable, Market- \nOriented Rural Finance Institution  \n \n41.  APB must be transformed into a sustainable, market-oriented rural finance institution to \n(i) extend its outreach in a way that does not burden the Government\u2019s budget, (ii) fulfill its vision \nof contributing to poverty reduction and growth of the rural economy, and (iii) eliminate its \ndistorting and crowding-out effect on the financial sector. \n \n42.  APB\u2019s restructuring plan was prepared and adopted in 2002. Implementation of the first \nphase began in March 2003 and was completed in 2004. The second phase will continue under \nthe RFSDP and will include key policy reforms such as the (i) adoption and implementation of a \ngovernance agreement for APB, (ii) phasing out of policy lending and interest rate subsidies from \n                                                 \n16 Article 65 of the Commercial Bank Decree has been interpreted by some to mean that all commercial bank loans \nmust be secured by physical collateral. \n ", "13 \nAPB, (iii) progressive recapitalization of APB based on performance, and (iv) strengthening of \nAPB\u2019s new organization through the appointment of qualified department heads. \n \n43.  The governance agreement will be the basis for the time-bound implementation of the \napproved APB Restructuring Plan, which includes best-practice provisions to \n \n(i)  bring APB under the prudential regulatory and supervisory regime for SOCBs;  \n(ii)  require APB to operate on a solely commercial basis;  \n(iii)  strengthen APB\u2019s institutional autonomy;  \n(iv)  write off loss-graded loans;  \n(v)  implement a policy lending phase out plan;  \n(vi)  report and grade performance;  \n(vii)  recapitalize APB based on performance;  \n(viii)  carry out sanctions for nonperformance;  \n(ix)  carry out internal and external audit;  \n(x)  strengthen APB\u2019s Board and management and clarify their roles;  \n(xi)  adopt new organizational unit mandates and job descriptions;  \n(xii)  reorganize the structure and staffing of APB and put in place necessary mitigating \nmeasures for retrenchment, if any;  \n(xiii)  upgrade APB\u2019s ICT systems; and  \n(xiv)  build  capacity  in  APB  including  human  resources  and  human  resource \nmanagement development, risk management development, and improvement in \naccounting and management information system (MIS). \n \n44.  MOF will inject additional capital into APB in accordance with the governance agreement \nand performance targets defined therein. BOL will ensure that the provisions of the governance \nagreement are adhered to and that, in the case of noncompliance, sanctions outlined in the \ngovernance agreement, including postponement of performance-based recapitalization, will be \napplied. MOF and BOL will review and update with APB on an annual basis the performance \ntargets and other conditionality for recapitalization, including specific requirements for portfolio \nworkout and NPL resolution, and update the governance agreement for performance-based \nrecapitalization. \n \nd.  Creating a Supportive Nonprudential Regulatory Environment for \nRural and Microfinance \n \n45.  Creating a supportive nonprudential regulatory environment is also crucial for rural and \nmicrofinance. Nonprudential regulatory issues relate to the general conduct of business. To \nensure that MFIs can operate sustainably, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly will \nissue an interpretation of Article 46 of the Contract Law that MFIs are exempted from interest \nrate ceilings, and the PMO will issue an instruction under Article 5 of Law No. 5 on the Bank of \nLao PDR (1995) authorizing BOL to issue microfinance regulations. \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n \n46.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $7.684 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Program. The Borrower will be the Government of the Lao \nPDR. The loan will have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years. An \ninterest rate of 1% per annum will be charged during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. The loan amount takes into account the depth and scope of the proposed policy \n ", "14 \nreforms  and  the  estimated  short-  and  medium-term  adjustment  costs  associated  with \nimplementing the reforms in the policy matrix.  \n \n47.  ADB  funds  will  support  policy  reforms  that  address  sensitive,  long-standing,  but \nfundamental  issues  and  socially  significant  measures  to  enhance  the  outreach  of  financial \nservices to the rural sector. The fundamental shift in the rural finance policy environment is \nreflected  in  the  (i)  phase  out  of  directed  lending  and  interest  rate  subsidies  from  APB; \n(ii) emphasis on autonomy, good governance, market orientation, and sustainability in APB and \nMFIs; (iii) performance-based recapitalization of APB; (iv) the encouragement of private sector \nparticipation in microfinance to enhance employment and income generating opportunities for \nthe  poor;  and  (v)  recognition  and  encouragement  of  the  role  of  international  donors  and \ndevelopment partners in microfinance. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \na.  Program Management \n \n48.  BOL will be the Executing Agency for the RFSDP and will oversee compliance with the \nreform program. BOL will establish a program management unit (PMU) and assign a program \ndirector and two full-time counterpart staff with qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB. \nThe PMU will consult with and coordinate with the RMFC as appropriate. To ensure coordination \nof the reform program, the deputy governor of BOL will chair a program steering committee \n(PSC) comprising senior representatives of PMO, MOF, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Department \nof International Economic Cooperation), Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), APB, and \nMinistry of Justice (MOJ). To ensure the necessary political support and oversight, each ministry, \ncommittee, or organization on the PSC will be represented by a member of sufficient seniority to \nfacilitate direct briefings to his or her minister, committee chair, managing director, etc. BOL will \nalso  ensure  coordination  with  provincial  authorities.  The  PSC  will  meet  quarterly  to  review \nimplementation progress and make decisions to ensure the attainment of the reform agenda. \nEnglish translations of the minutes of these meetings will be forwarded to ADB within 2 weeks of \nthe meeting. \n \n49.  BOL will be responsible for implementing the program and project components within its \nauthority  (i.e.,  the  enabling  policy  framework,  prudential  regulation,  MFI  supervision,  and \npromotion  of  a  diverse  and  competitive  private  sector).  BOL  will  establish  a  program \nimplementation unit (PIU) and assign a PIU director and two full-time counterpart staff with \nqualifications and experience acceptable to ADB. The PMU and PIU directors in BOL may be the \nsame person. \n \n50.  Because of the significance of the APB reform program, APB will be the implementing \nagency  (IA)  for  its  program  and  project  components  (i.e.,  APB  restructuring,  including \nimplementing its obligations under the Governance Agreement) and will establish its own PIU \nand assign a PIU director and four full-time counterpart staff with qualifications and experience \nacceptable to ADB. Other ministries, committees, agencies, etc. responsible for implementing \nnonprudential  reforms  will  each  establish  PIUs  and  appoint  a  PIU  director,  or  assign  the \nnecessary  staff,  to  coordinate  the  passage  of  the  reforms.  The  program  organization  is \npresented in Appendix 5. \n \n ", "15 \nb.  Implementation Period \n \n51.  Implementation  will  last  for  4  years,  beginning  in  September  2006  and  ending  in \nSeptember 2010. \n \nc.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n52.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  (Appendix  6).  The \nGovernment will certify that (i) if the loan proceeds are used to finance goods already imported, \nthe value of eligible imports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested \nwithdrawal; or (ii) if the loan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports \nin the immediately preceding one-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the \nrequested withdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn during the period. \n \nd.  Counterpart Funds, Tranching, and Monitoring \n \n53.  The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will finance local currency \ncosts relating to program implementation. Any counterpart funds not required for the Program \nwill be used first to finance the local currency costs of other projects financed by ADB, and \nsecond for general development purposes. \n \n54.  The proposed program loan will be released in three tranches. The first tranche of $2.7 \nmillion equivalent will be released on loan effectiveness; the second tranche of $2.5 million \nequivalent, about 15 months after the first tranche; and the third tranche of $2.484 million \nequivalent, about 18 months after the second tranche, subject to compliance with the conditions \nfor their release.  \n \n55.  Monitorable  and  time-bound  actions  are  reflected  in  the  policy  matrix.  Both  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  will  regularly  and  closely  monitor  RFSDP  implementation.  Both  will \ncontinue active policy dialogue throughout RFSDP implementation on matters relating to rural \nfinance development, and will pay close attention to the poverty impact of policy reforms and \nadjustment costs. Special audits and reviews will be conducted periodically. \n \ne.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n56.  The use of the loan proceeds will be audited on ADB\u2019s request, and ADB will retain the \nright  to  (i)  audit  any  account,  and  (ii)  verify  the  validity  of  the  certification  issued  by  the \nGovernment for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open a \ndeposit account at BOL to receive all loan proceeds. The Government will establish, manage, \noperate, and liquidate the account in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursements Handbook \n(January 2001) and on other terms satisfactory to ADB. The PIUs will submit quarterly progress \nreports to the PMU, as well as additional information and analysis to the PMU as appropriate or \nrequired. The PMU in turn will submit to the PSC and ADB quarterly progress reports on policy \nand institutional reform implementation. The reports will be submitted in such form and in such \ndetail as ADB may request, and should include (i) progress made and problems encountered \nduring  the  period  in  review,  (ii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to  remedy  problems \nencountered, (iii) the proposed detailed activity for RFSDP implementation, and (iv) expected \nprogress  during  the  next  quarter.  If  retrenchment  is  proposed  for  bank  staff  during  the \n ", "16 \nrestructuring of the APB, BOL will report what was done under the agreed-upon retrenchment \nand mitigation plans.17 In addition, BOL will ensure that APB will have its accounts audited \nannually  by  independent  and  competent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  signed  audits \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the calendar year. At the minimum, audited \nfinancial statements will be in English and will include income and expenditures, assets and \nliabilities, and cash flow, with the accompanying notes to the accounts. BOL will submit a \nprogram completion report within 3 months of program completion. \n \nf.  Program Performance Management System \n \n57.  BOL will establish and maintain a program performance management system that will \ninclude a database of the status of policy reforms and program indicators based on the policy \nmatrix, and the impact of policy reform measures at the sector and stakeholder levels, including \nresponse and performance of MFIs, in a form satisfactory to ADB. This will be linked with the \nproject performance management system discussed in para 77. \n \ng.  Program Review \n \n58.  ADB will monitor implementation through periodic reviews and progress reports. Annual \nreview missions will assess compliance with the program to ensure that program implementation \nremains  on  course.  At  the  end  of  the  second  year,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly \nundertake a comprehensive midterm review to evaluate the progress of the reform measures \nand  their  impact  on  the  rural  finance  sector.  The  Government  will  make  the  necessary \ninformation available to enable ADB to conduct the reviews and will keep ADB informed of \noutcomes of policy discussions that have implications for RFSDP implementation. \n \nC.  The Project Loan \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n59.  The project loan\u2019s objective is to promote a sustainable and market-oriented rural and \nmicrofinance  sector.  It  will  contribute  to  achievement  of  this  objective  by  assisting  the \nGovernment  to  (i)  build  BOL\u2019s  MFI  supervision  capacity,  (ii)  support  APB  to  complete  the \ncapacity building components of the APB Restructuring Plan begun under ADB TA cluster 3413 \n(footnote 11), and (iii) upgrade APB\u2019s ICT system. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n \na.  Building BOL\u2019s MFI Supervision Capacity \n \n60.  BOL\u2019s Supervision Department is responsible for licensing, regulating, and supervising all \nfinancial institutions, but there is currently no supervision for MFIs. For commercial banks, BOL \ncarries out off-site monitoring and on-site inspection. BOL has been unable to effectively enforce \nbank regulations because it has had an inadequate number of supervisors and inadequate \ninformation for proper supervision. BOL recently began enforcing prudential regulations for state-\nowned  banks  and,  with  assistance  from  IMF,  is  increasing  staff  and  putting  in  place  new \nprocedures that will strengthen its capacity to supervise commercial banks. BOL recently created \n                                                 \n17 Retrenchment is not expected. However, per APB\u2019s Governance Agreement, BOL in collaboration with APB will \ndefine and adopt mitigating measures to be adopted in the case of retrenchment, consistent with the law of the Lao \nPDR. \n ", "17 \na microfinance supervision division, with 4 staff members and a plan to expand to 13 staff \nmembers. BOL needs further assistance to enhance the regulatory and supervisory regime, \nimplement its provisions, and build supervision capacity for the MFI sector. This component will \nassist BOL to (i) create a sound prudential regulatory and supervisory environment for MFIs, \n(ii) introduce a regulatory and supervisory regime for the private and public sector in rural and \nmicrofinance, and (iii) build MFI supervision capacity.  \n \nb.  Capacity Building Under APB\u2019s Restructuring Plan \n \n61.  The project loan will finance the engagement of an international banking advisor (IBA) \nand  two  domestic  administrator/banking  assistants  (ABAs)  to  assist  APB  to  complete  the \nrestructuring program in accordance with the APB Governance Agreement. The IBA and ABAs \nwill assist to review, revise, develop, implement, and monitor modern banking policies, systems, \nand  procedures  that  will  allow  APB  management  to  make  commercially  oriented  banking \ndecisions in the best interests of APB. The IBA and ABAs will place special emphasis on \nimproved risk management, NPL resolution, and credit risks, policies, and procedures to stop \nloss-making activities. In carrying out his/her specific duties, the IBA will coach and train APB\u2019s \ndirectors, management, and staff to build capacity in APB. \n \n62.  APB  will  also  receive  specialized  assistance  to  review  its  accounting  policies  and \nprocedures. It will modify and document in manuals its policies and procedures in accordance \nwith the detailed recommendations of the diagnostic review carried out under subproject 2 of the \nTA cluster and the management letters from its recent financial audits. APB will revise and \ndocument its accounting standards and amend them to include (i) accounting on an accruals \nbasis, (ii) identifying and transferring NPLs to designated overdue ledger accounts on a timely \nbasis, (iii) writing off bad debts, (iv) adjusting reserves to reflect the net asset position, (v) making \nprovisions on guarantees and commitments for potential losses similar to any other extension of \ncredit, (vi) depreciating fixed assets over their estimated useful lives, (vii) valuing inventories at \nthe lower of cost and net realizable value, (viii) undertaking periodic stock counts and reconciling \nthese with accounting records, (ix) investigating discrepancies in stock count reconciliation, and \n(x) adopting full liability accounting for income taxes and deferred taxation.  \n \nc.  Upgrading APB\u2019s ICT Systems \n \n63.  A review of APB\u2019s current ICT system under ADB TA 3413 indicates that it needs to be \nreplaced. This was confirmed by the ICT Strategy for the Lao Banking Sector prepared by BOL, \nwith  the  assistance  of  the  European  Union.  These  reviews  found  that  APB\u2019s  current  ICT \nenvironment does not adequately provide the systems needed in a modern bank. Specifically, \n(i) there is a lack of vision and strategy for ICT development, and consequently no effective plan \nor budget provision; (ii) the mandate of the ICT unit is not clear in relation to its strategic and \nplanning functions; (iii) the systems currently in use at APB are unable to provide adequate \ncustomer information, making risk management and performance assessment difficult; (iv) the \ncurrent system does not give management sufficient information on the performance of products \nand  bank  units,  so  new  banking  products  and  services  can  be  developed  only  when  a \ncomprehensive and integrated core banking system is in place; (v) APB\u2019s ICT staff capacity is \ninadequate  for  APB\u2019s  current  and  future  needs;  (vi)  ICT  policy  and  procedures  are  not \ndocumented and not enforceable; (vii) ICT security is weak and there is no business continuity or \ndisaster recovery plan; (viii) software in many instances is not licensed and is thus unsupported; \n(ix) the current system is decentralized and has inadequate treasury capabilities; (x) much of the \ncurrent MIS is manual and prone to error; and (xi) connectivity between branches is weak or \nnonexistent, with reports and data often physically ferried from subservice units to branches and \n ", "18 \nfrom branches to head office. Additionally, shortcomings in the management reporting system \nmake it of limited use for management decision making: the capacity of present software to \ngenerate reports is inadequate for management reporting; current reports are not differentiated \nby user or management level; and the reporting system does not measure bank performance. \nMoreover, because APB has gone effectively unsupervised, the current system is inadequate to \nmeet BOL requirements under the new supervision regime, which will require that APB be \ntreated as a commercial bank subject to full prudential supervision by BOL.  \n \n64.  Building on a diagnostic study of APB\u2019s ICT system under the TA cluster, ADB project \npreparatory TA 413518 to prepare the rural finance development loan conducted an ICT needs \nreview and formulated an ICT development plan and systems design.19 Implementation of the \nplan will upgrade APB\u2019s hardware and software to provide for centralized online processing and \nthe progressive adoption of modules for modern banking products, including but not limited to \nappropriate loan and deposit products, payment systems, centralized treasury functions, risk \nmanagement, management information, and human resources management. The RFSDP will \nprovide for the total upgrade of APB\u2019s ICT systems in accordance with the plan.  \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n \n65.

The proposed financing is for an ADB loan of $2.316 million equivalent, including $0.414 \nmillion equivalent of the local currency cost for capacity building in APB and upgrading APB\u2019s \nICT system (Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix I). The Borrower will be the Government \nof the Lao PDR. In addition, FIRST will finance $0.281 million equivalent for the BOL MFI \nsupervision strengthening component on a parallel grant cofinancing basis. The Government will \nfinance the balance of $0.761 million equivalent, including $0.265 million from APB. The loan will \nbe from the Special Funds resources with a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 \nyears. The annual interest charge will be 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The \nloan will be utilized over a 48-month period from loan effectiveness. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \na.  Project Management \n \n68.  As Executing Agency, BOL and the PMU that it establishes will oversee and coordinate \nimplementation of the RFSDP, including the project components. Specifically, the PIU in BOL will \nimplement the MFI supervision component. APB will be the IA for its program and project \ncomponents (i.e., APB restructuring and ICT upgrading components). The PIUs will coordinate \nthe fielding and work of the consultants, including provision of adequate office space and, in the \ncase of APB, the ICT turnkey contractor. The PMU will ensure submission of periodic reports by \nthe PIUs. The program organization diagram (Appendix 5) also covers project management. The \nproject loan will have the same steering committee as the program loan. The steering committee \nwill ensure that the project activities are undertaken according to the agreed upon timetable and \nmonitor progress. \n \nb.  Implementation Period \n \n69.  The  project  loan  will  be  implemented  over  a  4-year  period,  September  2006\u2013\nSeptember 2010. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \nc.  Procurement \n \n70.  Goods and services will be procured following the provisions of ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. Equipment and services will be procured (i) by international competitive bidding \nwhere the cost is more than $500,000 equivalent, (ii) by limited international bidding where the \n ", "20 \ncost is from $100,000 to $500,000 equivalent, or (iii) by national competitive bidding procedures \nor shopping where the cost is less than $100,000 equivalent and several local suppliers can offer \nsatisfactory service facilities. The procurement plan is presented in Appendix 9. \n \nd.  Consulting Services \n \n71.  The component for building up BOL\u2019s MFI supervision capacity will require 5.5 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  from  an  MFI  regulation  and  supervision \nspecialist/team leader (4 person-months) and an accounting specialist (1.5 person-months); and \n9 person-months of domestic consulting services from a bank training specialist (6 person-\nmonths) and an accounting specialist (3 person-months). The component will be implemented \nover 12 months beginning in December 2006. As the component will be cofinanced by FIRST on \na parallel grant basis, consultants will be engaged by FIRST in accordance with FIRST's rules \nand regulations on recruitment, but final selection will be acceptable to ADB. The terms of \nreference of the consultants will be determined by an agreement between ADB and FIRST, and \nthe consultants will report to a steering committee comprising staff of BOL, ADB, and FIRST. All \nother key aspects of project administration will be coordinated between ADB and FIRST. \n \n72.  For  the  APB  restructuring  component,  42  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices will be provided by an IBA (36 person-months) and an accounting and MIS specialist \n(6 person-months); and 72 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided by \ntwo  ABAs  (36  person-months  each).  The  component  will  be  implemented  over  48  months \nbeginning in December 2006. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and following ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method. The \nsimplified technical proposal format will be used. Appendix 10 gives the consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference and Appendix 9, the procurement plan. \n \ne.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n73.  Eligible expenditures from the loan proceeds will be paid either through direct payment \nprocedure, commitment procedure, and/or imprest fund procedure in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Loan \ndisbursements  for  the  consulting  services  contracts  and  the  ICT  equipment  and  software \ncontract will make use of the direct payment procedure. If necessary, the Government will \nestablish an imprest account for the PMU to manage, replenish, and liquidate in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and any detailed arrangements between the Government \nand ADB. The initial amount to be advanced to the imprest account will be based on the \nestimated expenditures for 6 months, or $40,000, whichever is less. The ceiling on the imprest \naccount will be $100,000 and any individual payment will not exceed $10,000. The account will \nbe established with BOL or a reputable commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The PMU will \nensure  proper  accounting  for  eligible  expenditures  incurred  and  paid  out  from  the  imprest \naccount. PMU will also ensure that ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be \nfollowed when liquidating and replenishing the account for all individual payments not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $10,000. \n \nf.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n74.  The PMU will submit quarterly reports to ADB on the use of the loan proceeds, project \nadministration, and financial management. The reports, consolidating inputs from PIUs,  will \ncover  (i)  expenditures,  (ii)  activities  undertaken,  (iii)  highlights  of  audit  reports,  (iv)  training \nactivities and their impact, (v) institutional strengthening, and (vi) progress on MFI expansion. \n ", "21 \nBOL will submit a project completion report (PCR) within 3 months of program completion. \nQuarterly reports and the PCR will be combined with the quarterly reports and PCR on program \nloan implementation. APB will submit its annual independent audit reports, carried out according \nto IFRS, to BOL, MOF, and ADB. \n \n75.  BOL and the IAs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify goods \nand services financed out of the loan proceeds and will disclose their use following sound \naccounting  principles.  Such  accounts  and  records  will  be  audited  annually  by  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified copies of the audit \nreport, together with the auditor\u2019s opinion will be submitted to the Government and ADB. The \naudit  reports  will  include  a  separate  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedure. \n \n76.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nEA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \ng.  Project Performance Management System \n \n77.  The  PMU,  drawing  on  data  from  the  PIUs,  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project \nperformance management system that will contribute to its quarterly reports. The information \nsystem will include (i) number of MFIs operating in the country; (ii) number of MFIs operating in \nethnic group areas; (iii) number of clients of APB and MFIs, broken down by gender and ethnic \nclassification;  and  (iv)  financial  and  efficiency  indicators  of  APB  and  MFIs.  Beyond  these \nindicators, it is recognized that meaningfully measuring the impact of rural and microfinance \nprograms  on  poverty  reduction,  income  generation,  consumption,  employment,  and  other \nindicators is a highly specialized research undertaking. Therefore, neither the PMU nor the PIUs \nwill be expected to undertake such an impact study. However, the Government, BOL, and the \nIAs agree to permit and support such a study if requested by ADB.20 \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n78.  The TA will have two components: (i) a program management component to assist the \nGovernment  manage  and  carry  out  the  reform  agenda,  and  (ii)  an  APB  human  resources \ncomponent  to  assist  APB  to  implement  a  key  institutional  strengthening  component  of  its \nrestructuring  plan.  The  reform  agenda  is  complex,  and  the  program  requires  careful \nmanagement  to  ensure  a  consistent  and  coherent  approach.  Hence,  under  the  program \nmanagement component, the TA will assist BOL, APB, and other Government ministries and \nagencies to \n \n(i)  coordinate  and  integrate  rural  and  microfinance  policy  reforms  and  program \nimplementation; \n                                                 \n20  Methodological issues related to such research are discussed in B. Coleman, \u201cThe Impact of Group Lending in \nNortheast Thailand, \u201c Journal of Development Economics, October 1999. \n ", "22 \n(ii)  carry through APB\u2019s plan to phase out policy lending, the loan workout plan \ninitiated in 2003, and its performance-based recapitalization to ensure its full \ntransition to market-oriented operations; and \n(iii)  formulate and document a simplified mechanism, policies, and procedures for on-\nbudget policy lending. \n \n79.  The human resources component of the TA will assist APB to strengthen its human \nresources management under phase 2 of its restructuring plan. Specifically, it will assist APB to \n \n(i)  develop performance standards and a performance assessment system;  \n(ii)  introduce modifications to employee contracts to link them to job descriptions and \ncodes of practice;  \n(iii)  devise a new bonus scheme to reward individual excellence in job performance, \nas well as collective success in terms of the bank\u2019s profit per IFRS, based on the \nnew job descriptions and performance assessment system; and  \n(iv)  develop and deliver the training courses outlined in the training plan prepared in \nphase 1. \n \n80.  The TA will begin in December 2006 and will be implemented over 48 months ending \nDecember 2010. The total cost of the TA is $820,000. ADB\u2019s funding program will contribute \n$400,000  for  the  program  management  component,  consisting  of  $375,000  of  the  foreign \nexchange cost and $25,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government of Denmark \nwill contribute $300,000 for the APB human resources component, comprising $191,900 of the \nforeign exchange cost and $108,100 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will \nfinance the balance of the local currency cost.  \n \n81.  International consulting services totaling 16 person-months will be provided by a financial \nsector  reform  specialist/team  leader  (5  person-months),  a  bank  restructuring  specialist \n(3 person-months), a corporate planning specialist (2 person-months), and a human resources \nspecialist  (6  person-months).  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. A full description of the TA, including implementation arrangements, \noutline terms of reference, cost estimates, and financing plan, is in Appendix 11. \n \nV.  THE JAPAN FUND FOR POVERTY REDUCTION GRANT \n \n82.  In association with RFSDP, a grant of $1.98 million was approved by JFPR for catalyzing \nmicrofinance  for  the  poor.  This  project  will  provide  grant  funds  for  eligible  MFIs  though  a \nMicrofinance Fund (MFF). The MFF will support initiatives by MFIs in the Lao PDR that will \n(i) contribute directly or indirectly to improved incomes, livelihoods, and opportunities for poor \npeople; (ii) involve a product, service, system or procedure that is innovative and would be \nunlikely to be addressed without the support of the MFF; (iii) result (directly or indirectly) in \nincreased access to financial services by the poor; (iv) be sustainable, or result in sustainable \nimpact,  after  an  MFF  grant  has  been  utilized;  (v)  share  resource  costs  required  for \nimplementation between the MFF and the MFI; (vi) be implemented within 3 years, other than in \nexceptional circumstances; and (vii) not create unfair competition or otherwise distort markets.  \n \n83.  Participating MFIs will be privately owned by members or shareholders and provide \nmarket-driven financial services. Members or shareholders will be drawn from local communities \nand include women, small-scale entrepreneurs, farmers, government employees, youth, and \npeople from households of differing income levels. MFIs will comprise mainly savings and credit \n ", "23 \nunions (SCUs), village banks, and village savings and credit groups (VSCGs), but any institution \nthat meets the specified criteria will be eligible to apply for a grant. Grants will be awarded \nthrough a competitive process that will rank proposals according to their poverty impact, the \nextent of private sector resources mobilized, the ability of the applicant to deliver the intended \noutputs, innovation, sustainability, and replicability.  \n \n84.  Grants will be used to provide start-up support to new and transforming private MFIs, \nincluding  support  to  pilot-test  new  institutions  and  innovative  models  that  provide  flexible \nservices suited to the poor, and consolidating currently unsustainable VSCGs into larger local \nMFIs (e.g., SCUs or village bank networks). This support will take the form of matching grants for \nseed capital, start-up costs, equipment, training, and capacity building, and the MFI will have to \ncontribute an amount of its own capital equal to the grant from the MFF. Eligible MFIs will include \nnew MFIs seeking to establish themselves on a sustainable basis, and existing MFIs that wish to \ntransform unsustainable practices into sustainable best practices. Conditioned on the submission \nof a business plan or institutional development plan that focuses on sustainability and best \npractice, preference will be given to MFI applicants that target women and/or ethnic group \ncommunities, are located in poor remote areas of the Lao PDR, and/or are supported by an \ninternational donor or development partner.21  \n \n85.  In addition to providing grants, the MFF will undertake a range of other activities. They \nwill include (i) workshops to promote the industry and best practice in microfinance; (ii) activities \nto promote the concept of financial intermediation between MFIs and the development of such \nintermediation; (iii) training for MFIs in key management functions (for example: governance, \naccounting,  information  systems,  credit  assessment);  (iv)  assistance  to  MFIs  in  preparing \ninstitutional development plans; and (v) preparation of terms of reference for a feasibility study \nand prospectus for a national-level MFI.  \n \n86.  The  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $2,858,000.  JFPR  will  finance  $1.98  million,  the \nGovernment will finance $78,000, and participating MFIs or their sponsors will provide matching \ncontributions of $800,000. BOL will be the EA. International consulting services of 46 person-\nmonths will be provided by a microfinance specialist (12 person-months), an accounting and MIS \nspecialist (3 person-months), a legal specialist (1 person-month) and a management assistant \n(30 person-months); and domestic consulting services of 53 person-months will be provided by \ntwo microfinance specialists (for 25 person-months each) and an accounting specialist (3person-\nmonths). ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  All  procurement  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines. The component will be implemented over 36 months beginning in January 2007. A \nsummary  description  of  the  JFPR  program,  including  its  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation  arrangements,  poverty  reduction  impact,  and  benefits  and  risks,  is  in \nAppendix 12. \n \nVI.  THE JAPAN FUND FOR INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION \nAND TECHNOLOGY GRANT \n \n87.  In association with the RFSDP, a grant of $472,000 has been approved by JFICT for \nupgrading the information and communications system of APB. APB\u2019s ICT upgrade will be \ncarried  out  on  a  turnkey  basis.  In  preparation  for  the  procurement,  installation,  and \nimplementation  of  the  new  ICT  systems,  the  internal  ICT  function  of  APB  will  need  to  be \n                                                 \n21 To complement the JFPR-funded activities, ADB is also processing a separate TA to enhance the role of the Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union as social intermediaries in organizing women into microfinance groups. \n ", "24 \nsubstantially strengthened. APB will receive assistance from a JFICT grant for internal capacity \nbuilding and managing the turnkey contract. Specifically, JFICT will assist APB to (i) upgrade its \nICT human resources capacity to manage the ICT systems upgrade; (ii) review and confirm that \nthe systems specifications proposed are adequate for APB\u2019s needs; (iii) plan and execute the \nbidding, selection, and contracting processes with the turnkey contractor and the communication \ninfrastructure provider; (iv) monitor the turnkey installation and milestone achievement, verify that \nspecifications have been adhered to, review data migration plans, and carry out user acceptance \ntesting; (v) prepare and carry out a training plan; (vi) review and evaluate the effectiveness of \ntechnical  and  operational  training  provided  under  the  turnkey  contract;  and  (vii)  plan  and \nimplement the rollout of systems to the whole APB branch network.  \n \n88.  The total cost is estimated at $520,400 equivalent. JFICT will finance $472,000, and the \nGovernment will finance $48,400 equivalent. APB will act as EA. A total of 11 person-months of \nconsulting  services  from  an  international  ICT  systems  specialist  (5  person-months)  and  a \ndomestic ICT systems specialist (6 person-months) will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and following ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod. All procurement will be conducted in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines. A \nsummary  description  of  the  JFICT  program,  including  its  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation  arrangements,  poverty  reduction  impact,  and  benefits  and  risks,  is  in \nAppendix 13. \n \nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n89.  At  a  macroeconomic  level,  the  Program  will  establish  a  broad-based  but  integrated \nframework for market-oriented reforms in the rural finance sector and result in a deepened \nfinancial sector and greater financial intermediation. This will in turn result in a more efficient \nallocation of resources. The promotion of savings through the removal of policy lending from \nAPB and its concurrent savings mobilization effort as part of its restructuring plan, as well as the \ndevelopment of deposit-taking MFIs will contribute to this process. The phasing out of policy \nlending from APB will enable the Government to realize much-needed budgetary savings; and \nthe  transfer  of  residual  policy  lending,  if  any,  to  an  on-budget  mechanism  will  increase \ntransparency and improve monitoring, thus enabling the Government to better assess the costs \nand benefits of such lending. Indirectly, the stimulus to enterprise created through enhanced \noutreach of credit will result in increased investment, job creation, and\u2013through the formal sector \nenterprises that will benefit\u2013an increase in tax revenues for the Government. The additional \navailability of capital also has the potential to add to export revenues where it is channeled into \nthe  specific  identified  opportunities  for  increasing,  for  example,  agricultural  and  handicraft \nexports. The increased outreach of savings services will encourage monetization. \n \n90.  Microfinance providers and sponsors will benefit from the Government\u2019s adoption of an \nenabling and transparent regulatory and supervisory regime and will be able to operate with \nconfidence,  with  the  added  certainty  about  the  operating  environment\u2019s  encouragement  of \ninvestment.  The  formalization  of  the  microfinance  sector  will  act  as  a  stimulus  to  private \ninvestment in the sector. \n \n91.  Farmers, rural people in general and rural enterprises will benefit from improved access \nto  savings  services  that  will  provide  a  safe  and  readily  accessible  means  to  store  and \naccumulate  capital,  and  from  increased  access  to  working  capital  and  investment  funding. \nIncome benefits will accrue through intensification and expansion of production and acquisition \n ", "25 \nof new technology. Low-income households will have improved ability to manage risks owing to \nimproved  access  to  both  credit  and  institutional  savings  facilities.  Business  start-up  and \nexpansion will lead to job creation for both the self-employed and wage earners.  \n \nB.  Impacts \n \n92.  The Program will support the Government\u2019s vision of a deepened financial sector that \n(i) fosters broad-based sustainable economic growth and contributes to macroeconomic stability \nand poverty reduction to help the Lao PDR graduate from least developed country status by \n2020,  (ii)  is  comprised  of  strong  bank  and  nonbank  institutions  that  efficiently  allocate  the \ncountry\u2019s resources to the most productive investments and income-generating activities, and \n(iii) is  diversified  and  provides  wide  access  to  financial  services  through  extensive  market \noutreach. \n \n1.  Impact of Creating an Enabling Policy Framework for Public and Private \nProvision of Rural and Microfinance \n \n93.  The program will for the first time create a formal national policy framework for the \ndevelopment of rural and microfinance in the Lao PDR. This will move the sector\u2019s development \naway from an ad hoc project approach toward a coherent national strategy that provides short-, \nmedium- and long-term direction, has been participatory in its formulation and formalization, and \nwill remain participatory in its implementation. This formal foundation will create an enabling \nenvironment for the deepening of the rural and microfinance sector and will encourage domestic \nprivate participation in the sector. \n \n2.  Impact  of  Creating  a  Sound  Prudential  Regulatory  and  Supervisory \nEnvironment for Public and Private Rural and Microfinance Institutions \n \n94.  A  sound  prudential  regulatory  and  supervisory  environment  will  create  greater \ntransparency  in  the  financial  sector  generally  and  in  APB  and  MFIs  in  particular.  Creating \ntransparency  in  APB\u2019s  financial  affairs  will  improve  APB\u2019s  overall  governance,  planning, \noperations, and risk management. Ensuring that APB is properly regulated and supervised will \nprovide added protection to APB\u2019s depositors and build confidence in APB as a deposit-taking \ninstitution, allowing it to grow in a market-oriented way in a competitive environment. Regulating \nMFIs will, for the first time in the Lao PDR, provide a full legal basis for the establishment and \ngrowth  of  privately  owned  MFIs.  These  measures  together  with  the  development  of  MFI \nsupervisory capacity in BOL will remove the present legal and regulatory uncertainties that have \nbeen cited as the major reason for the lack of investment in the sector. Introducing the new legal \nand regulatory regime will create the opportunity for financial intermediation in the MFI sector. \nCollectively these measures will enhance the safety and soundness of the financial sector. \n \n3.  Impact  of  Transforming  APB  into  a  Financially  Self-Sustainable,  Market-\nOriented Rural Finance Institution  \n \n95.  The transformation of APB from a bank that acts as a channel for loss-making policy \nlending into a market-oriented bank that operates on a commercial basis will result in extending \nAPB\u2019s  outreach  as  it  expands  its deposit-based business  and  relies  less  on  the  resource-\nconstrained Government budget. It will also (i) improve efficiency in APB\u2019s operations as it \ncomes under pressure to compete for resources; (ii) strengthen APB\u2019s management autonomy; \nand (iii) improve APB\u2019s currently weak credit culture, reduce NPL levels, reduce losses, and \nhence  reduce  the  fiscal  burden  that  APB  places  on  the  Government.  Based  on  historic \n ", "26 \nperformance, there will be fiscal savings of about $1 million per year; with losses accelerating in \nrecent years, the likely impact will be significantly more than $1 million per year in the future. \nAPB\u2019s  transformation  will  also  remove  some  of  the  distortionary  impacts  created  by  its \nsubsidized lending operations: low deposit mobilization, crowding out of MFIs and other banks \nfrom areas where its subsidized lending programs have operated, and unrealistic expectations \nregarding sustainable interest rates. \n \n4.  Impact of Creating a Supportive Nonprudential Regulatory Environment for \nRural and Microfinance \n \n96.  Improvements in the business environment for MFIs will reduce their transactions costs, \nenhance  their  profitability,  and  ensure  a  fair  and  transparent  operating  environment,  thus \nencouraging investment and outreach.  \n \n5.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n \n97.  The RFSDP is expected to have a positive social impact by strengthening the rural \nfinance  sector  and  promoting  sustainable  delivery  of  financial  services  in  rural  areas.  The \nimproved policy and regulatory environment supporting rural and microfinance institutions will \npromote the establishment and operation of sustainable microfinance and other rural financial \ninstitutions, including those established by the private sector and international development \nagencies. These institutions will provide the rural poor with alternative and more affordable \noptions compared with informal sources, which typically charge interest rates of 10% per month \nor  higher.  The  RFSDP  will  foster  demand-driven,  sustainable  rural  financial  services. \nInternational experience shows that the poor are willing to pay market interest rates and value \nsustained  access  more  than  a  subsidized  interest  rate.  Developing  a  market-oriented  rural \nfinancial system is therefore the best way to provide the poor with access to affordable financial \nservices. Sustained access to financial services will enable the rural poor to (i) invest in, and take \nadvantage  of,  opportunities  in  farm  and  nonfarm  income-generating  activities;  (ii)  finance \nhousehold  emergencies  and  consumption;  and  (iii)  accumulate  savings  in  secure  deposit \nfacilities. The MFF, which will pilot and promote best-practice MFIs serving a diverse population, \nwill give preference to supporting sustainable microfinance initiatives that benefit women and \nethnic groups. The RFSDP is in line with the NGPES, approved by the National Assembly in \nOctober  2003,  which  identifies  access  to  rural  finance  as  critical  to  reducing  poverty  and \npromoting economic growth.  \n \n98.  Restructuring  APB  into  a  financially  self-sustainable,  market-oriented  rural  finance \ninstitution will have both direct and indirect positive social benefits. Directly, APB\u2019s transformation \nwill enable it to increase outreach and contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction in \nthe Lao PDR. International and Lao experience have shown that the non-poor are the primary \nbeneficiaries of subsidized credit because they have better access and can absorb larger loans \nand, therefore, larger subsidies. APB\u2019s nonsubsidized, demand-driven expansion is therefore \nexpected to benefit the poor disproportionately. Indirectly, phasing out directed lending and \ninterest rate subsidies from APB will free up scarce resources in the Government budget, which \ncan contribute to better-targeted poverty interventions and reductions in the Government deficit, \nthus contributing to macroeconomic stability. If some residual policy lending is shifted to an on-\nbudget nonbanking mechanism, the enhanced transparency will allow policy makers to better \nassess the costs and benefits of such lending. \n \n99.  Based on the poverty and social impact assessment, no persons will be negatively \naffected in terms of ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous \n ", "27 \npeople; thus, the RFSDP will not trigger activities to implement these ADB policies. The issue of \npossible  labor  retrenchment  due  to  APB  restructuring  was  reviewed.  Based  on  existing \ninformation about APB\u2019s current and future labor requirements, no retrenchment is likely to take \nplace. Staff will be trained to ensure that they may effectively contribute to the operation of the \nrestructured APB. According to the BOL guidelines and existing human resource management \npractices of other SOCBs, any overstaffing issues at APB will be addressed through natural \nattrition  (retirement,  transfers,  and  voluntary  resignation).  If  during  RFSDP  implementation \nsignificant retrenchment is deemed necessary based on new APB business projections, APB will \nprepare a mitigation plan to be funded by MOF, per the Governance Agreement. Appendix 14 \ngives the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.  \n \n6.  Environmental Impacts \n \n100.  A review of the policy interventions under the RFSDP indicates that they will not have any \ndirect adverse environmental impact. The appraisal of potential income-generating activities that \nmay be funded through APB or the MFIs receiving assistance from MFF indicates that these \nfarm and nonfarm activities are not likely to result in significant environmental impact. To ensure \nthat no adverse impact results at the micro level, APB and MFIs will be required to adhere to \nsound environmental lending practices and ensure that their lending operations are consistent \nwith  existing  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  For  this  purpose,  training  on  sound \nenvironmental lending practices is incorporated in RFSDP activities. The environmental impacts \nof policy intervention are reviewed in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nC.  Risks \n \n101.  The  successful  implementation  and  impact  of  the  RFSDP  will  depend  on  several \nassumptions that are subject to varying degrees of risk. Mitigating measures have been put in \nplace where appropriate and possible. \n \n102.  Political Commitment to Reform, and Timely Implementation of Reforms. The lack \nof sustained Government commitment to a market-oriented rural finance sector is a significant \nrisk, as is the possibility of implementation delays. However, the Government has reiterated its \ncommitment on several occasions and in several key policy and strategy documents in the past \n3 years \u2013 the Policy Statement on Development of a Sustainable Rural and Micro Finance \nSector (endorsed by PMO in November 2003), the National Growth and Poverty Eradication \nStrategy (endorsed by the National Assembly in October 2003), and the Strategy and Action \nPlan to Develop Sustainable Rural and Microfinance (in final draft stage and to be issued by BOL \nas a first-tranche RFSDP policy action). In addition, the design process has included extensive \nawareness creation and consultation with stakeholders, supported by ADB TA 3413 (footnote \n12) since October 2000, including (i) policy awareness workshops and study tours for senior \npolicy makers, and the Government\u2019s agreement to reform recommendations in the ensuing \nRural and Microfinance Policy Issues Paper; (ii) an in-depth diagnostic study of APB and the \nGovernment\u2019s agreement with its findings; (iii) approval by the Government of the feasibility \nstudy and the business plans for three member-owned pilot SCUs, and the subsequent issuance \nof licenses for the pilot SCUs; (iv) the Government\u2019s approval and the APB Board\u2019s adoption of \nthe  APB  restructuring  plan  and  new  market-oriented  corporate  mission  for  APB;  (v)  the \nGovernment\u2019s agreement to phase out interest rate subsidies and directed lending from APB; \nand  (vi)  the  Government\u2019s  approval  of  new,  best  practice  regulations  for  SCUs  and  MFIs. \nThroughout this 3-year process, there has been a continuous and progressive dialogue between \nthe Government, ADB, and other stakeholders in the sector, including PMO, BOL, APB, MOF, \nCommittee  for  Planning  and  Cooperation,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF), \n ", "28 \ncommercial banks, microfinance practitioners, mass organizations, NGOs, and other agencies \nsuch as the World Bank and IMF. Implementation will involve the same stakeholders and will \nengage them through a formal consultative framework. Effective policy dialogue, stakeholder \ncoordination,  and  capacity-building  support  through  project  components  and  the  TA  are \nsafeguards for smooth implementation of policy reforms. Public awareness of the benefits from \nthe reforms will further mitigate the possible risk of delays in policy reforms. To expedite reforms, \nthe RFSDP supports institutional strengthening and performance-based recapitalization for APB. \n \n103.  Fiscal Management. The estimated cost of implementing the Program is $19.2 million. \nThe amount represents the direct costs of policy reforms and related investments, including \n(i) creating an enabling policy framework ($1.5 million); (ii) creating a sound prudential regulatory \nand supervisory environment that  includes BOL strengthening ($1.6 million); (iii) creating a \nfinancially  self-sustainable,  market-oriented  APB,  including  institutional  strengthening,  ICT \nupgrade, and recapitalization ($13.6 million, of which $8.1 million represents recapitalization);22 \nand (iv) creating a supportive nonprudential regulatory environment ($0.2 million). This cost \npotentially  represents  a  burden  on  budgetary  resources  and  management  capacity  of  the \nGovernment. However, a number of mitigating measures have been put in place to reduce this \nrisk. In terms of budgetary resources, grant cofinancing amounting to $6.5 million from various \nsources has been mobilized to assist in financing the program.23 The Government will finance \nthe remaining $12.7 million, of which $10 million will be covered by the ADB program and project \nloans.  Much  of  the  remaining  $2.7  million  takes  the  form  of  in-kind  contributions  from  the \nGovernment, such as staff time. \n \n104.  To mitigate the risks of fiscal management, ADB, IMF and World Bank have supported \nthe Government in improving its financial management. ADB TA 3627 has provided support for \nthe financial management processes covering capital revenue and expenditures. It included \nimprovements  to  the  capital  expenditure  chart  of  accounts,  internal  controls  over  financial \ntransactions, recording, and reporting. TA 3771 is providing institutional and capacity support to \nthe  State  Audit  Office.  It  introduces  financial  audit  manuals  and  procedures  based  on \nInternational Office for Supreme Audit Institutions standards and best practices. ADB TAs 3309 \nand 4180 provide support to improve internal auditing, recording, and reporting for the financial \nmanagement systems for recurrent revenue and expenditure. IMF's Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth  Facility  (PRGF)  has  provided  support,  in  cooperation  with  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), to simplify revenue collection procedures for customs and \nduties. IMF is also providing TA to support the Treasury Department in revising the chart of \naccounts  to  improve  control  over  bank  accounts  and  cash  management.  The  Swedish \nInternational Development Agency (Sida) is providing support on taxation. The World Bank is \nproviding assistance to the fiscal budget processes, including development of a revised budget \nnomenclature. MOF will track the fiscal impact of the program through its medium-term fiscal \nframework. \n \n105.  Participation of the Private Sector. A major constraint to private participation in the \nrural and microfinance sector has been an unclear and adverse policy, legal, and regulatory \nframework. While this framework has recently been improved substantially, private investors and \n                                                 \n22 The ADB Banking Sector Reform Program Loan, approved in November 2002, included a preliminary estimate of \nAPB recapitalization costs of $2.5 million, operational restructuring costs of $850,000, and ICT upgrade costs of \n$1.5 million (for a total of $4.85 million). \n23 This includes $2 million from TA cluster 3413-LAO; $400,000 from the associated Program Management TA; \n$150,000 from PPTA 4135-LAO; and $3.42 million from cofinanciers since 2002, including Concern Worldwide, \nFIRST, Government of Denmark, Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), and the World Bank. \n ", "29 \ninternational donors and development partners may still adopt a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude to assess \nthe Government\u2019s commitment to effective implementation of the new framework. The RFSDP \nhas  put  in  place  at  least  two  mitigating  measures.  First,  policy  dialogue  and  stakeholder \ncoordination (through a regime of semiannual consultations with sector stakeholders) and public \nawareness campaigns (through the MFF) will provide forums through which investor concerns \ncan be aired and addressed. Second, the MFF will directly catalyze investment in the sector by \nproviding TA and start-up grants to private MFIs that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable \nprovision of microfinance services to the poor.  \n \nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n \n106.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  promptly  adopt  and  implement  in  a  timely  manner  the \npolicies and program actions indicated in the Program as specified in the policy \nletter, including the policy matrix, and will ensure that such policies and actions \nare sustained.  \n(ii)  The Government will actively assist and support ongoing program monitoring and \nevaluation by facilitating consultations with central and provincial agencies, and \nother key stakeholders as appropriate.  \n(iii)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nstakeholders about measures to ensure effective implementation of the Program.  \n(iv)  The Government will give ADB the opportunity to comment on relevant studies \nand draft laws or decrees that are likely to impact on program objectives and \nimplementation.  \n(v)  The Government will ensure that adequate and timely funds are made available to \nBOL  and  relevant  central  agencies  and  provincial  administrations  to  facilitate \nimplementation of the Program. \n(vi)  The Government will support BOL in licensing, supervising, and regulating MFIs, \nand will ensure that adequate funds are provided to BOL in a timely and efficient \nmanner to ensure its successful functioning. \n(vii)  The  Government  will  promptly  inform  ADB  of  any  changes  in  the  board  of \ndirectors or senior management of APB and will ensure that any such changes \nare made in accordance with the provisions of the Governance Agreement. \n \nIX.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n107.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 5,143,000 to \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Rural Finance Sector Development \nProgram from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term \nof 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nProgram Loan Agreement presented to the Board;  \n \n ", "30 \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 1,550,000 to \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Rural Finance Sector Development \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nProject Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n \n(iii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  assistance  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $1,980,000 to the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic for Catalyzing Microfinance for the Poor to be provided by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction on a grant basis. \n \n \n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n \n21 July 2006 \n ", "  Appendix 1  31 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The rural and microfinance sector in Lao PDR is at an embryonic stage. The principle \nprovider of rural financial services is the state-owned Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB), which \nwas created in 1993 as a policy bank to deliver subsidized credit to the agriculture sector. Its \noutreach has been limited to about 15% of the population because it depends on the limited \nfunding available from the Government and donors and because its policies, inefficient and \nsubsidized  operations,  and  weak  financial  condition  prevent  it  from  mobilizing  commercial \nfunding. Very few microfinance institutions exist because of a historically unfavorable policy and \nregulatory environment as well as high transactions costs due to a dispersed population and \npoor infrastructure. \n \n2.  Rural Economy. The population of Lao PDR is estimated at 5.5 million. The rural \npopulation comprises 80% of the total population, but 90% of the poor live in rural areas. Overall \nthe population is growing at about 2.3% per year, but rural to urban migration has resulted in \nurban population growth of about 4.7% per year and rural population growth of about 1.8% per \nyear.1 \n \n3.  The contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP was 51% in 2002. Crops contributed \n30%, livestock and fisheries 17%, and forestry 4% of total GDP. Agricultural GDP grew by an \naverage of 5% per annum during the 1990s.2 The agricultural sector is characterized by several \nfarming systems. Flatland rain-fed and irrigated farming systems are found close to the Mekong \nRiver and its tributaries. In these areas, cultivated land is used for lowland rice production in the \nwet  season  and  for  livestock  grazing  in  the  dry  season.  Upland  farming  systems  are \ncharacterized by slash and burn practices, and are dominated by a single wet season crop, \nmainly upland rice, but including maize in some areas. The gathering of forest products provides \nsupplementary  food  and  firewood.  Cattle,  pigs,  and  poultry  are  raised  under  extensive \nhusbandry  systems.  The  plateau  farming  system  is  found  on  the  Bolovens  plateau \n(encompassing  parts  of  Attapeu,  Champasack,  and  Sekong  provinces)  and  in  two  further \nplateau areas in Khammouane and Xieng Khouang provinces. Under this system, commercial \ncrops  are  increasingly  produced,  including  cardamom,  coffee,  fruit,  and  vegetables.  Cash \nincome  from  the  sale  of  these  crops  is  used  to  purchase  rice  grown  in  the  lowlands  to \nsupplement home production. Cattle are an important part of this farming system and are \ngrazed on the plains and in the forests. The mountain farming system operates in remote \nvillages. The system is based on slash and burn cultivation of upland rice on mountain slopes \nwith little or no production surplus. A wide variety of other crops are incorporated into the \nsystem,  including  cassava,  groundnut,  maize,  mung bean,  soybean,  fruit,  vegetables  and \nopium. The latter, despite pressure to abandon the crop, still generates important cash income. \nLivestock  are  an  important  part  of  the  system,  are  more  intensively  managed  than  other \nsystems in Lao PDR, benefiting from the feeding of crop by-products to supplement grazing.  \n \n4.  Livestock are found on most farms in the Lao PDR with 89% of all farm households \nraising one or more livestock types.3 Livestock sales account for more than 50% of cash income \nin  many  upland  and  mountain  areas.  Agribusiness  has  begun  to  develop  in  the  Mekong \nCorridor,  particularly  near  Vientiane  and  some  borders  areas.  The  majority  of  Lao  PDR \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2003. World Development Indicators Database. Washington, DC. \n2  World Bank. 2003. World Development Indicators Database. Washington, DC. It should be noted that major annual \nvariations in output have occurred because of the country\u2019s dependence on rain-fed agriculture. While overall the \ncountry is self-sufficient in food, some remote areas still face significant seasonal food shortages. \n3  ADB. 2001. Review of the Livestock in Lao PDR. Manila. \n ", "32  Appendix 1 \nagribusinesses are small cottage industries employing 2 to 5 persons. In 2000, there were about \n470 registered agribusinesses, and many more unregistered, including enterprises involved in \nbaking,  canning  and  preserving,  coffee  roasting  and  packaging,  milk  products,  noodle \nmanufacture, oil seed processing, rice milling, saw milling and wood industries, slaughtering, \nsoy sauce manufacture, and textiles.4 \n \n5.  There are significant opportunities for agricultural and rural enterprise development. \nLao PDR lies at the center of a rapidly expanding regional economy that offers a regional \nmarket with some 200 million people. Given its resource base, location, and potential cost \nadvantages, the agricultural sector is well placed to benefit from growing regional prosperity and \nthe  increasing  demand  for  food  and  other  agricultural  products  in  Lao PDR  and  adjoining \ncountries.  \n \n6.  Recent research that examined competitive advantage with neighboring countries of \nselected agricultural crops (rice, maize, soybean, coffee, and cotton) indicates that with the \nbacking of research and efficiently run agricultural support services, there is a potential for \nLao PDR to compete advantageously with its neighboring countries in the production of these \ncommodities. 5 Maize and soybean have export potential for animal feed, and there is scope for \nexpansion of coffee exports. Cotton can substitute for imports used in the textile sector, one of \nLao PDR\u2019s main export earning industries. Fruit and vegetable production can be expanded to \nmeet domestic demand and for export to Thailand.6 The demand for meat in the domestic \nmarket and neighboring countries is likely to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. \nLao PDR has a competitive advantage in supplying cattle and buffalo to Thailand. Pilot projects \nhave shown that commercial fish farming can result in yields of up to 500 kilograms per hectare. \nIntegrating fisheries with livestock production has potential to increase this further. In addition to \ntimber, forests yield non-timber forest products (NTFPs) that can be used for subsistence \npurposes or to enhance the cash incomes of rural households. Some of these products also \nprovide cash income. Other traditional forms of income generating activities in the uplands \ninclude handicraft and basketry made from bamboo and rattan. Products include winnowing \nbaskets, many types of carrying baskets, mats, and small tables. Handicraft and embroidery \nproducts include buttons, hair ornaments, and necklaces that form part of traditional dress. \nThere is also a strong tradition of weaving in the lowlands. Other activities include metalworking \nfor tools production, especially knives, machetes, and spades. \n \n7.  However, many of these opportunities have not been fully realized, partly because of \nlack of access to finance. \n \n8.  Commercial Banking Sector. The financial sector of the Lao PDR remains shallow with \nlimited financial intermediation and without significant outreach. The low level of monetization \nthroughout the population has kept the Lao PDR at one of the lowest levels of financial depth in \nthe world. The sector consists exclusively of banks. There is one monopoly insurance company, \nno leasing companies, and no other nonbank financial institutions. Financial services reach only \na small part of the population and those services delivered, with few exceptions, are not being \nprovided on a sustainable or efficient basis.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Experience Inc, 2002, \u201cTA No 3603-LAO Smallholder Development Project, Draft Final Report\u201d. \n5  ADB. 1999.

The Lao PDR banking sector is small in absolute terms\u2014about $400 million in total \nassets and employing around 1,500 people. The sector is dominated by three state-owned \nbanks: Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao (BCEL), Lao Development Bank (LDB), which \nhave traditionally been considered \u201cstate-owned commercial banks\u201d or SOCBs, and APB which \nwas established as a policy bank. Together, they account for almost three quarters of the total \ngross assets of the banking system. Branches of several foreign banks started operating in \nVientiane  in  the  early  nineties,  but  deficiencies  in  the  banking  environment  in  which  they \noperate,  particularly  the  legal  framework,  and  limitations  on  activities  have  limited  their \ncontribution to the domestic economy.  \n \n10.  BCEL began its operations in 1976. In 1989, it augmented its international business, and \nstarted to develop its branch network. It now has seven branches including the head office in \nVientiane. Its products include a high level of fee income from trade financing and foreign \nexchange transactions and its clients are generally the larger enterprises in the Lao PDR. BCEL \ndominates the market with about four tenths of total banking assets. LDB is the result of the \nmerger in 2002 of Lao May Bank and Lane Xang Bank. It has a branch in each of the country\u2019s \n17 provinces, and its clients are primarily small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and \npersonal banking customers, including housing loan borrowers. \n \n11.  In addition to the SOCBs, there are three joint-venture commercial banks (JVCBs): Joint \nDevelopment Bank (JDB), Lao-Viet Bank (LVB), and Vientiane Commercial Bank (VCB). The \nJVCBs mainly service customers in the country\u2019s principal cities. JDB was established in 1989. \nLVB started operations in 1999, with BCEL and Vietnam Development Bank as its joint owners. \nVCB began operating in 1995. A third banking category consists of six foreign commercial \nbanks (FCBs), each operating a single branch office in Vientiane, and one other UK bank with a \nrepresentative office in Vientiane\u2014Standard Chartered Bank. The six FCBs are principally Thai \ncommercial  banks\u2014Bangkok  Bank,  Krung  Thai  Bank,  Siam  Commercial  Bank,  Bank  of \nAyudhya, and Thai Military Bank\u2014and one Malaysian bank, namely Public Bank. The FCBs \nservice their home country clients who have operations in the Lao PDR. \n \n12.  Agriculture  Promotion  Bank.  The  Government's  policy  to  support  access  to  rural \nfinance has been implemented primarily by APB, which was established as a policy bank in \n1993 and has acted as a channel for Government and donor funds and subsidies by carrying \nout policy lending on behalf of the Government.7 APB\u2019s interest rates have been determined \neither by the Government or by agreements with donors. Typically, these are below market \nrates and insufficient to cover APB\u2019s costs. APB\u2019s ordinary lending is funded from deposits, with \nlending rates closer to commercial terms (e.g., 20% for crops and livestock; 24% for handicraft; \n26% for small industry; 30% for trade and services; and 34% for overdrafts). These rates are set \nby APB\u2019s Board, but they reflect rates elsewhere in the state sector and are not based on APB\u2019s \nactual risks.  \n \n13.  APB\u2019s activities extend to about 6,000 villages. APB has a total of 129,493 borrowers, \ncomprising 123,306 group members in 13,342 groups with an average 9 members per group; \nand 6,187 individual borrowers. APB currently reaches about 14% of Lao households. APB's \noutreach is limited because it depends on the limited funding available from the Government \nand donors and because its policies, inefficient and subsidized operations, and weak financial \ncondition prevent it from mobilizing commercial funding. Institutionally, APB carries out financial \nand non-financial activities (for example: distributing fertilizer and equipment), reflecting its \n                                                 \n7  \u201cPolicy lending\u201d in Lao PDR generally refers to directed credit at preferential interest rates. \n ", "34  Appendix 1 \nmixed mandate as a financial institution and development organ of the state. As a result, its \noperations are inefficient, and management autonomy and responsibility are limited. \n \n14.  Subsidized interest rates and the common practice of rolling over loans have prevented \nAPB from developing and adopting realistic credit risk assessment and loan pricing practices. \nThis has contributed to a weak credit culture, resulting in high levels of non-performing loans. \nConsequently, according to international accounting standards, APB has been operating at a \nsignificant loss since it was established in 1993. However, prior to 2002, APB had never been \naudited, making its financial situation (and, therefore, costs to the Government budget) unclear. \nAPB\u2019s first audit, which took place in 2002, indicated a high rate of non-performing loans \n(NPLs)8 as of December 2001, and provision for doubtful debts was inadequate. APB\u2019s portfolio \nregarding undertaken at 31 December 2003 indicates that the high NPL rate is driven largely by \nits policy lending, which has an NPL rate that is 2.4 times higher than the NPL rate of its \nordinary loan portfolio. Consequently, APB has incurred significant losses each year since its \nestablishment, representing costs to the Government budget. Loans of about KN82.5 billion \n(35% of APB\u2019s total portfolio), needs to be written off as of 31 December 2003. This includes \nKN59.4 billion in policy loans (52% of the policy lending portfolio) and KN23.2 billion in ordinary \nloans (26% of the ordinary portfolio). On average, since APB\u2019s establishment in 1993, about \n$1 million equivalent per year has been lost, but losses have accelerated in recent years. A \nmore  complete  analysis  of  APB\u2019s  financial  performance  and  projections  is  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n15.  Microfinance Institutions and Initiatives. Microfinance is at a nascent stage in Lao \nPDR. The combined outreach of the four largest initiatives is less than 6,000. APB\u2019s operations \nhave tended to distort the rural finance system and result in misallocation of resources, low \ndeposit mobilization, and crowding out of MFIs and other banks, further limiting outreach. They \nalso create a climate of unrealistic expectations on the part of potential borrowers and central \nand local officials regarding the cost of credit, making it difficult for microfinance initiatives to \ncharge  sustainable  interest  rates  even  in  areas  where  APB\u2019s  outreach  is  limited.  Village \nrevolving funds established by the LWU in some 1,600 villages (sometimes with the support of \ninternational donors) reinforce these expectations\u2014in general, they channel a limited amount of \nsubsidized credit to a few households, do not mobilize local resources, have low repayment \nrates, and are not sustainable. It is unknown how many are still operational. An indicative list of \nmicrofinance initiatives is included in Appendix 11. \n \n16.  Projects  or  MFIs  that  attempt  to  charge  sustainable  interest  rates  are  typically \ndiscouraged  or  prevented  from  doing  so  by  local  officials.  The  lack  of  a  clear  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  for  microfinance  gives  MFI  practitioners  little  recourse  to  counter \ninterference from officials. This lack of a transparent framework and the consequent interference \nis cited by international NGOs and other potential microfinance investors as the main reason for \nnot investing in the sector. Current regulations cover only credit cooperatives (regulation no. \n02/SB of 15 November 1994 issued by BOL) and provide limited or no guidance on operational \nrules  of  governance,  conflicts  of  interest,  auditing  requirements  (external  and  internal), \nprudential discipline, reporting requirements, sanctions, and experience or qualification of board \nmembers. Commensurate with the lack of a legal and regulatory framework for microfinance, \nBOL has no experience and limited capacity to supervise MFIs. As a result of these constraints, \nvery few MFIs operate in the country. Most microfinance is delivered through one-off projects \n                                                 \n8  NPLs are loans on which repayment of principle or interest is overdue by more than 90 days. \n ", "  Appendix 1  35 \nand other unsustainable initiatives, capacity is low, and accounting practices are weak or non-\nexistent. \n \n17.  Despite these constraints, five microfinance projects or initiatives have been undertaken \nwith the explicit goal of providing sustainable services. The Cooperative de Credit pour le \nSolution  aux  Petites  Unites  de  Production  (CCSP)  was  established  in  1996  by  Lao \nentrepreneurs, but with some assistance from the French NGO Society divertissement et de \nD\u00e9veloppement  International  (SIDI),  and  now  comprises  12  member-owned  cooperatives \nproviding microfinance for crop and livestock production in Vientiane Municipality and Vientiane, \nChampasack,  Luang  Prabang,  Saravane,  and  Xieng  Khouang  Provinces.  It  serves \napproximately 2,500 members.  \n \n18.  In cooperation with the Government, the United Nations Capital Development Fund \n(UNCDF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched a microfinance \nproject in late 1997. Two rural microfinance institutions (MFIs) were established in Oudomxay \nand Xayaboury Provinces using group-lending methods. A third initiative in Vientiane aimed to \nconsolidate the experience of the Sihom Project Savings and Credit Scheme (SIPSACRES), an \nurban credit and savings cooperative founded under an earlier UNDP Project in 1995. UNDP \nand UNCDF support for the project ended in 2002, and the project is currently managed by the \nMinistry of Finance. The project is targeted at income generation and women\u2019s development \nand makes cash loans, mainly for wholesale and retail trading, to solidarity groups who also \nsave with the project. As of 31 December 2003, the project served 1,195 borrowers and 1,900 \nsavers. \n \n19.  The Proj\u00eat de D\u00e9veloppement Rural du District de Phongsaly (PDDP) was established in \n1997 by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). It operates village banks for farmers \nin Phongsaly District. At 31 December 2003, PDDP was providing credit to 2,300 borrowers for \nproduction of cash crops, livestock, handicrafts, and for petty trade.  \n \n20.  The Rural Development Cooperative (RDC) was founded by Lao entrepreneurs and \noperates  in  thirty  villages  in  Naxiaithong  District  of  Vientiane  Municipality.  It  started  its \noperations in August 2001 utilizing members\u2019 share capital and a loan from the Vientiane \nMunicipal Development Fund. Loans are made for agriculture, fisheries, handicraft, wholesale \nand retail trade, services, and for education and weddings, generally against physical collateral \n(although group guarantees are accepted for rice production loans) and a savings deposit of \n20% of the loan amount. At 31 December 2003, RDC had about 890 active borrowers and \nabout 1,480 savers. \n \n21.  In addition to these four microfinance initiatives, work commenced in March 2003, with \nsupport from ADB TA cluster 3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development, on the establishment of \nthree  member-owned,  market-driven  savings  and  credit  unions  (SCUs)  in  Vientiane, \nSavannakhet, and Luang Prabang Provinces. Pledge drives in each province secured pledges \nfrom more than 250 founder members in each location for more than the minimum required \ncapital of $3,000. New regulations and byelaws have been prepared and approved by BOL for \nthese pilot SCUs, and licenses were granted to the three SCUs in March 2004. The SCUs will \ncommence services for their 900 founding members in May 2004. \n \n22.  Lessons Learned. Lao authorities have begun taking important steps to improve the \npolicy, regulatory, and institutional environment for rural and microfinance. Since March 2000, \nADB  has  been  assisting  the  Government  in  its  efforts  under  TA  cluster  3413-LAO:  Rural \nFinance Development. Given the nascent stage of the sector, subproject 1 of the TA cluster, \n ", "36  Appendix 1 \ncarried  out  in  2000\u20132001,  built  awareness  of  rural  finance  issues,  including  international \nexperience and best practice, through a series of workshops and study tours and prepared a \n\u201cPolicy and Issues Paper\u201d that identified weaknesses in the institutional, policy, legal, and \nregulatory framework. Step by step, it has been recognized that an improved policy environment \nfor rural and microfinance is needed, and that market reforms in APB are necessary to enable it \nto increase outreach sustainably without burdening the government budget. International and \nLao experience demonstrates that the non-poor are the main beneficiaries of subsidized interest \nrates since they have greater access and can absorb larger loans. Over half of APB\u2019s loan \nportfolio is concentrated in the two wealthiest areas of the country\u2014Vientiane and Champasak \nInternational experience has shown that when subsidized loans are not available, the poor are \nwilling to pay market interest rates, and they tend to value sustained access more than a low \ninterest rate. Therefore, developing a market-oriented rural financial system is the best way to \nprovide the poor with access to affordable financial services. \n \n23.  To begin reforming APB, subproject 2 (May\u2013December 2002) conducted a diagnostic \nreview and financial audit of APB. Based on the findings, an APB Restructuring Plan was \nprepared,  which  addresses  weaknesses  in  APB's  policies  and  procedures  in  many  areas, \nincluding governance, planning, organizational structure, pricing, credit, products and services, \ninformation  and  communications  technology  (ICT),  risk  management,  and  accounting.  In \nNovember 2002, the Government adopted a new corporate vision for APB to \"operate in a \nmarket-oriented,  financially  self-sustainable  way  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  the \ncountry's  economic  growth  and  prosperity.\"  Implementation  of  the  first  phase  of  the  APB \nRestructuring Plan began in March 2003 under subproject 5. Importantly, this includes a plan to \nphase policy lending out of APB by the end of 2007 and to shift residual policy lending, if any, to \na transparent, non-banking mechanism on the Government budget. \n \n24.  While  the  capacity  of  APB  is  being  developed  through  its  restructuring  program, \ninstitutional mechanisms involving the private sector are also being promoted under subproject \n3 of the TA cluster, begun in March 2003, which established three pilot SCUs in areas with \nstrong market linkages. These SCUs are member-owned and managed, with full autonomy in \ntheir management, hiring procedures, interest rates, access to capital, and choice of products, \nclientele, and geographical coverage.  \n \n25.  In addition, the Government's Rural and Microfinance Committee (RMFC), with support \nfrom  ADB,  Concern  Worldwide,  the  Financial  Sector  Reform  and  Strengthening  Initiative \n(FIRST), and the World Bank, prepared an official vision and policy statement for the sector, \nbased on a participatory process that included key stakeholders, including villagers. The thrust \nof the Policy Statement for the Development of Sustainable Rural and Micro Finance Sector is \nthe development of a market-oriented, sustainable sector, which includes active private sector \nparticipation, removal of interest rate caps and subsidies, and development of an enabling \npolicy, legal, and regulatory framework. The Policy Statement was endorsed by a forum of \nProvincial Vice Governors and other senior Lao officials in June 2003, by BOL in August 2003, \nand by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in November 2003. Subproject 4 of the TA cluster (co-\nfinanced by FIRST) has sustained the momentum of the reform process by assisting the RMFC \nthrough  a  participatory  process  to  develop  a  strategy  to  promote  rural  and  microfinance \ndevelopment, and assisting BOL's Department of Supervision to develop an enabling legal and \nregulatory framework. The regulatory framework was officially issued in June 2005, and the \nstrategy will be issued as a first-tranche condition. \n ", "  Appendix 2  37 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND COORDINATION IN THE

Rationale \n \n1.  The reform agenda is complex, and the program requires careful management to ensure a \nconsistent and coherent approach both within and between (i) reforms that involve Government \nparticipants including PMO, BOL, MOF, APB, the MOFA (Department of International Economic \nCooperation);  local  organizations;  and  international  donors  that  are  current  or  potential \nstakeholders in the microfinance sector; and (ii) Project Loan components that support elements of \npolicy  implementation.  The  Government  has  therefore  requested  assistance  for  program \nmanagement. \n \n2.  Under the first phase of the APB restructuring plan, APB has revised the description of \nboard responsibilities and developed job descriptions for individual board members incorporating \nmore  explicit  requirements  on  risk  management,  conflict  of  interest,  financial  control,  legal \ncompliance, governance practices, and disclosure. APB has prepared an organizational transition \nplan  that  adds  new  functions  and  creates  additional  deputy  director  positions  to  supervise \nexpanded groups of functions recommended  in the diagnostic review. Specific new functions \ninclude: a banking services division, a bank marketing division, a treasury division, a branch \noperations division, a risk management unit, a settlement unit, a legal unit, and a training unit. APB \nhas prepared new divisional and branch mandates and job descriptions in line with best practice. A \ntraining unit has been established and an outline training plan has been prepared under phase 1. \nThe Government and APB have requested assistance to implement the second phase of human \nresources strengthening under APB\u2019s restructuring plan. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n3.  The objective of the TA is to assist the Government to implement key aspects of the rural \nand microfinance program embodied in its Strategy to develop a market-oriented, financially self-\nsustainable rural and microfinance system that contributes to poverty reduction and the country\u2019s \neconomic growth and prosperity. Specifically, the TA will assist the Government to implement two \ncomplementary components. \n \nC.  Program Management Component \n4.  The TA will assist BOL, APB, and other Government ministries and agencies to \n \n(i)  coordinate  and  integrate  rural  and  microfinance  policy  reforms  and  strategy \nimplementation; \n(ii)  carry though APB\u2019s policy lending phase-out plan, the loan work out plan initiated in \n2003, and the performance-based recapitalization of APB to ensure its full transition \nto market-oriented operations; and \n(iii)  formulate and document a simplified mechanism, policies, and procedures for on-\nbudget policy lending. \n \nD.  APB Human Resource Capacity Building Component \n5.  This component of TA will assist APB to implement the human resources management \ncomponent under phase 2 of its restructuring plan. Specifically, it will assist APB to: \n \n(i)  Develop performance standards and a performance assessment system. \n(ii)  Introduce modifications to employee contracts to link them to job descriptions and \ncodes of practice.  \n ", "70  Appendix 11 \n(iii)  Devise a new bonus scheme to reward individual excellence in job performance, as \nwell as collective success in terms of the bank\u2019s profit per IAS, based on the new job \ndescriptions and performance assessment system.  \n(iv)  Develop and deliver the training courses outlined in the training plan prepared in the \nfirst phase. \n \nE.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n6.  The total cost of the TA is $820,000, consisting of $566,900 in foreign exchange costs and \n$253,100 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB\u2019s funding program will finance $400,000 for the \nProgram Management Component, consisting of $375,000 of the foreign exchange costs and \n$25,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The Government of Denmark will finance $300,000 \nfor the APB Human Resources Component, consisting of $191,900 of the foreign exchange costs \nand $108,100 equivalent of the local currency costs. The Government will finance the remainder of \nthe local currency costs. Equipment procured under the ADB TA cluster 3413-LAO: Rural Financial \nDevelopment will be utilized for the TA. Additional equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines . Detailed cost estimates are presented below. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Executing Agency \n \n7.  BOL will act as EA for the first component of the TA, and APB will act as EA for the second \ncomponent. BOL and APB will provide furnished office facilities in their head offices.

Genesis \n \nSince 2000, the ADB TA cluster 3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development has assisted \nthe Government to begin developing a sustainable, market-oriented rural financial system to \ncontribute to poverty reduction in Lao PDR. The TA cluster was requested by the Government \nbecause it recognized that weaknesses in the policy environment and institutional capacity were \nmajor constraints to developing sustainable rural and microfinance and expanding outreach. \n \nWith the TA\u2019s assistance, the Government's Rural and Microfinance Committee (RMFC) \nhas prepared a \u201cPolicy Statement for the Development of a Sustainable Rural and Microfinance \nSector\u201d, which was endorsed by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in November 2003, and presents \nthe  Government\u2019s  vision  of  a  diverse,  sustainable,  market-oriented  sector  that  will  expand \nsignificantly to contribute to the Government\u2019s National Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP). \nThe TA has also (i) assisted the RMFC to develop a draft National Strategy to promote rural and \n ", "  Appendix 12   79 \nmicrofinance, which includes promoting private MFIs that focus on sustainability and outreach, \nand  consequently  contribute  to  poverty  reduction;  and  (ii)  assisted  the  Department  of \nSupervision  of  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL)  to  develop  an  enabling  legal  and  regulatory \nframework that will facilitate the establishment of new microfinance institutions (MFIs) and \nensure the development of a viable rural and microfinance sector.  \n \nThe draft National Strategy has five basic components: (i) to create an enabling policy \nframework; (ii) to create a sound prudential regulatory and supervisory environment; (iii) to \ncreate a market-oriented state-owned sector; (iv) to create a diverse and competitive private \nmicrofinance  sector;  and  (v)  to  create  a  supportive  non-prudential  regulatory  environment. \nUnder part (iv) the Strategy calls for (a) allowing pilot testing and providing start-up support to \nprivate  rural  and  microfinance  institutions,  (b)  encouraging  a  diversity  of  microfinance \ninstitutions that operate autonomously and sustainably, (c) creating a practitioners\u2019 association, \nand (d) fostering the development of full-scale private institutions. Therefore, the Microfinance \nFund and its Management Unit are designed to assist the Government to realize its policy, \nvision, and strategy for the sector, in particular to promote the piloting, establishment, and \noperation of sustainable, best-practice MFIs to serve a diverse population, including women and \nethnic groups, and thereby contribute to the Government\u2019s poverty reduction goals. \n \n4.  Innovation  \n \nMicrofinance is at an embryonic stage in Lao PDR. Outreach is extremely limited, and \nthe poor in particular have little access to formal financial services. Thirty-nine percent of the \ncountry\u2019s population is poor, and over 90% of the poor live in rural areas. However, only about \n15% of Lao households have access to formal financial sources, and the vast majority are in \nnon-poor urban areas. In the absence of access to formal sources of credit, the poor rely on \ninformal sources of finance, including relatives, friends, merchants, and moneylenders, who \ncharge interest rates as high as 240% per year (20% per month). The Government's policy to \nsupport access to rural finance has been implemented primarily by the Agriculture Promotion \nBank  (APB),  which  has  conducted  directed  lending  at  below-market  interest  rates.  APB's \noutreach  has  been  limited  because  it  depends  on  the  limited  funding  available  from  the \nGovernment and donors, and because its policies, inefficient and subsidized operations, and \nweak financial condition prevent it from mobilizing commercial funding. APB has been operating \nat a significant loss since it was established in 1993, representing a substantial cost to the \nGovernment budget. It is now recognized that APB\u2019s directed lending policies have distorted the \nrural finance system and resulted in misallocation of resources, low deposit mobilization, and \ncrowding  out  of  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  and  other  banks.  Moreover,  the  Lao  and \ninternational  experience  demonstrates  that  the  non-poor  are  the  main  beneficiaries  of \nsubsidized interest rates since they have greater access and can absorb larger loans. When \nsubsidized loans are not available, the poor are willing to pay market interest rates, and they \ntend to value sustained access more than a low interest rate. Hence, the poor in particular will \nbenefit from sustainable MFIs. \n \nBased  on  their  recognition  of  APB\u2019s  weaknesses,  the  Lao  authorities  have  begun \nrestructuring APB, with ADB support, to transform it into a sustainable, market-oriented rural \nfinance institution. The plan includes phasing out directed lending and interest rate subsidies \nover 3 years. The Government has also adopted a new Policy Statement for Sustainable Rural \nand Microfinance, which includes a policy to support the development of sustainable private \ninitiatives. \n \n ", "80   Appendix 12 \nIn this context of Lao PDR\u2019s transition to a market economy, the Government\u2019s new \nfocus on building sustainable market-oriented MFIs and phasing out its directed-credit approach \nis innovative. Such a step has been difficult even in more developed market economies, so its \noccurrence in Lao PDR is extraordinary. Similarly, the creation of a special Microfinance Fund \n(MFF)  to  provide  start-up  grants  and  seed  capital  to  private  MFIs  is  innovative  and  is  a \ndemonstration of the Government\u2019s commitment to its stated policies. A number of bilateral \ndonors  and  international  NGOs  have  begun  to  express  some  interest  in  investing  in \nmicrofinance in Lao PDR, now that the policy environment is improving. However, they also \nremain skeptical because of past practices, so they are eager to see a demonstration of the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment. Preliminary results of an ongoing survey indicates that there would \nbe a strong demand for grants from the MFF. The MFF will therefore catalyze private-sector-led \ngrowth in sustainable, market-oriented MFIs that are a proven method for reducing poverty. The \npoor in remote areas, particularly women and ethnic groups, will benefit because MFIs serving \nthem will be given preference for matching grants, subject to meeting the other eligibility criteria, \nincluding a focus on sustainability and best practices. Similarly, MFIs (e.g., savings and credit \nunions) that develop innovative, flexible products and services that are specifically designed for \nthe poor will be given preference. \n \nSimilarly,  outreach  activities  under  the  MFF  (e.g.,  workshops  and  trainings)  will \ndisseminate  best  practice  principles  throughout  the  country,  both  among  officials  and \npractitioners. Hence, the entire project is an innovative approach to stimulate the creation and \ngrowth  of  private  MFIs  in  Lao  PDR,  including  in  the  poorer  remote  areas.  The  MFF  and \nassociated activities will ensure that the momentum of reforms built up with the assistance of \nthe ADB TA cluster will continue. A more efficient, diverse, competitive, and market-oriented \nrural finance system will increase access to financial services and significantly expand income-\ngenerating opportunities, generate employment, and reduce poverty. \n \n5.   Sustainability \n \n  Sustainability will be achieved in three ways.  \n \nFirst, the focus of the Microfinance Fund\u2019s activities will be on supporting the creation \nand growth of sustainable, private, market-oriented MFIs that follow international best practices. \nHence, the MFF will contribute to the establishment of a sustainable microfinance sector. Of \nparticular importance in this effort will be the consolidation, on a pilot basis, of some of the \nvillage savings and credit groups (VSCGs) that have been established in some 1600 villages in \nLao  PDR.  Most  of  these  are  either  non-functioning  now  or  are  unsustainable  because  of \ninefficient credit and management systems that have focused on channeling limited, cheap \ncredit to members. The project will therefore consolidate a sample of these VSCGs into larger \nlocal MFIs, which may then serve as a model for future consolidation of other VSCGs.  \n \nSecond, if the Fund proves successful and is needed to catalyze further growth following \nthe JPFR grant, then it will be in a position to attract additional funding from international donors \nand/or the Government. In such a case, the MFFMU would be transformed into a legal \u201cfund\u201d \nunder Lao law, with representation on its board from donors and shareholders. The MFFMU and \nsystems established with the JFPR grant, along with additional donor support, will enable the \nMFF and MFFMU to sustain its operations.  \n \nThird, project activities include the preparation of the terms of reference and prospectus \nfor carrying out a feasibility study to establish a private (or public-private partnership) national-\nlevel MFI. Among the options that this study would consider would be to transform the MFF and \n ", "  Appendix 12   81 \nMFFMU into a national-level MFI, and the study would include a financing plan to attract donor \nsupport. For example, bilateral donors and international NGOs may be invited to take an equity \nstake in the transformed MFF / national MFI, and may do so in a public-private partnership with \nthe Lao Government, and participating MFIs that have benefited from the MFF could be invited \nto join the national MFI as branches.  \n \nIn these three cases, the focus of this project is on creating MFIs that will be sustainable \nover the long-term. Such a focus on sustainability is the best way to ensure that the poor have \nthe continued access to the financial services that they need. \n \nMoreover, in terms of environmental sustainability, although loans from participating \nMFIs to clients are expected to be small and therefore have insignificant environmental impacts, \nall participating MFIs will be required to have sound environmental policies, including following \nLao environmental laws and the conduct of environmental due diligence for loans that have \npotential environmental effects. \n \n6.  Participatory Approach \nPrimary beneficiaries and other affected  Other key stakeholders and brief description \ngroups and relevant description \n\u2022 Throughout the 4 years of implementing the TA  \u2022  Throughout implementation of the TA cluster, \ncluster, primary beneficiaries (e.g., villagers,  several workshops have been held with the \nwomen\u2019s groups, central and local officials)  donor community and Government officials \nhave been consulted and benefited from  from the central and provincial levels.

Rationale for Grant Funding versus ADB Lending \n \nThe  JFPR  grant  will  complement  a  Sector  Development  Loan  for  the  rural  and \nmicrofinance sector, and has been designed in a way to reflect the objectives and policies of the \nGovernment  of  Lao  PDR.  The  Government  generally  seeks  loan  funds  for  investments  in \nconcrete goods and services, while preferring grant financing for training, capacity building, and \nproject support. Despite this preference, the Government will be borrowing from the ADB loan to \ncontinue the APB restructuring plan and upgrade BOL\u2019s capacity to supervise MFIs\u2014both \ncomponents  are  mostly  training  and  capacity  building.  The  program  loan  would  ensure \ncontinued improvements in the policy and regulatory environment to support the establishment \nand operation of private MFIs. The JFPR grant would finance complementary training, outreach \nfor MFI practitioners and Government officials, as well as create a Microfinance Fund (MFF) and \n ", "  Appendix 12   85 \nManagement Unit (MFFMU) to provide start-up grants to MFIs focused on sustainability and \noutreach to the poor. It would also establish the framework for a feasibility study for a national \nMFI legal fund to support MFIs. Given the Government\u2019s tight fiscal position, the amount the \nGovernment is already borrowing for other activities, and the focus of the proposed JFPR \nactivities on capacity building through training, workshops, and start-up grants, it would be \ndifficult for the Government to borrow for the proposed activities. However, the overall package \ndemonstrates  the  Government  commitment  to  rural  and  microfinance  program,  including \npromotion of sustainable private MFIs focused on the poor. \n \nD.

While the Government will use an ADB loan to \npurchase new hardware and software for APB and finance its turnkey installation, the JFICT grant would \nfinance the associated assistance to APB to (i) oversee and manage the specification and turnkey \nbidding process and the turnkey implementation contract, (ii) build capacity in APB to undertake its role in \nthese processes and subsequently roll-out systems throughout its network, and (iii) conduct training and \ncapacity building to use the new system. APB\u2019s ICT and MIS lag far behind similar banks in the region, \nmaking an ICT and MIS upgrade necessary to bridge the digital divide between APB and more modern \nbanks. The upgrade will also enable APB to be fully integrated into the Lao banking system, and \nspecifically meet its reporting requirements to the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL, the central bank). As Lao \nPDR\u2019s primary rural financial institution with the country\u2019s largest branch network, APB accounts for the \nvast majority of loans to rural clients, and specifically targets poor farmers and rural micro and small \nentrepreneurs. Therefore, improvements in APB\u2019s ICT and MIS will contribute to poverty reduction and \neconomic growth by (i) reducing the costs and improving the efficiency of delivery of financial services to \nAPB\u2019s rural clients, thus allowing it to expand outreach to poor clients on a sustainable basis, and (ii) \nimproving APB\u2019s internal governance by enabling it to improve financial transparency and ensure more \neffective prudential oversight by BOL.  \nExpected Key Performance Indicators: \n(i)   Finalized user requirements and technical specifications (by month 3) \n(ii)   Turnkey contract signed (by month 8) \n(iii)   Turnkey contract implemented and final acceptance given (by month 14) \n(iv)   Upgraded ICT systems rolled out to all APB branches (by month 24) \n(v)   Improved management reporting and performance indicators (quarterly) \n \nIII.

Specifically: (i) there is a lack of vision and \nstrategy for ICT development, and consequently no effective plan or \nbudget  provision;  (ii)  the  mandate  of  the  ICT  Unit  is  not  clear, \nspecifically in relation with its strategic and planning functions; (iii) \nthe ICT staff capacity is inadequate for APB\u2019s current and future \nneeds; and (iv) ICT policy and procedures are not documented and \nnot enforced. \n \nA modern ICT and MIS will support APB\u2019s restructuring effort by \nrequiring  the  adoption of  more efficient  and  transparent  policies, \nprocedures, and reporting, as well as improve connectivity among \nbranches. In order for a modern ICT and MIS to be purchased, \n ", "Appendix 13  99 \nimplemented,  and  incorporated  into  daily  operations,  extensive \ntraining and capacity building is needed. Component A will assist \nAPB to upgrade its human resources capacity to (i) manage the ICT \nand MIS upgrade and (ii) implement the new system by designing a \ntraining program to include, but not necessarily be limited to, the \nfollowing areas: \n\u2022  introduction to modern banking systems using ICT strategy \nformulation and centralized data processing;  \n\u2022  project  management  for  implementation  of  ICT  and  MIS \nprojects;  \n\u2022  preparation of bidding documents and related commercial and \ntechnical terms;  \n\u2022  tender evaluation for ICT and MIS projects;  \n\u2022  user acceptance testing including preparation of test scripts \nand reporting on test results;  \n\u2022  data conversion and preparation for going live; and \n\u2022  hands-on user training in the new systems. \nThis  training  program will  ensure  APB\u2019s  capacity  to  continually \nevaluate  its  ICT  and  MIS  and  to  undertake  the  necessary \nprocesses for future upgrades, as well as enable staff to effectively \nuse the new ICT system that will be procured under Component B. \nMonitorable Deliverables/Outputs  \u2022  Integrated, customized training program, including a range of \nclassroom and on-the-job training activities; and \n\u2022  Completed  training  for  APB  staff  on  banking  systems,  ICT \nproject  management,  bid  process,  tender  evaluation,  and \noperation of new system. \nImplementation of Major Activities:  \u2022  Training program at the end of month 1; \nNumber of months from grant  \u2022  Training ongoing throughout project: \nactivities  o banking systems, IT project management, and bid process \ntraining by month 2;  \no tender evaluation training by month 3;  \no user  acceptance  training  and  data  migration  training  by \nmonth 12; and \no roll-out and user training from month 15. \n \nComponent B   \nComponent Name  ICT and MIS Upgrade \nCost ($)  $204,900 (including contingencies) \nComponent Description  APB\u2019s current ICT and MIS do not adequately provide any of the \nsystems needed in a modern bank. Specifically the current system \n(i)  is  decentralized,  (ii)  cannot  provide  sufficient  customer \ninformation,  (iii)  does  not  provide  a  tool  for  effective  risk \nmanagement, (iv) has inadequate treasury capabilities, (v) does not \ngive  management  sufficient  information  on  the  performance  of \nproducts  and  bank  units;  (vi)  does  not  adequately  allow  the \nintroduction of new banking products and services; and (vii) does \nnot permit ADB to satisfactorily report to BOL. Much of the current \nMIS is in fact manual and prone to error. Connectivity between \nbranches  is  weak  or  non-existent,  with  reports  and  data  often \nphysically  ferried  from  sub-service  units  to  branches  and  from \nbranches to head office. Moreover, ICT security is weak, there is no \nbusiness continuity or disaster recovery plan, and software is mostly \nunlicensed and thus unsupported. A review of the current system \n ", "100  Appendix 13 \nunder ADB TA 3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development indicates \nthat it needs to be replaced. This was confirmed by an ICT Strategy \nfor the Lao Banking Sector prepared by the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL, \nthe central bank) with the assistance of the European Union (EU). \n \nWhile the purchase of the hardware and software for the new system \nwill be financed by an ADB loan (see Financing Plan below and \nCosts in appendix), this Component will assist APB staff to carry out \nthe following highly technical activities, which are currently beyond \nAPB\u2019s capacity:  \n \n\u2022  review and confirm that the systems specifications proposed \nare adequate for APB\u2019s needs; \n\u2022  plan  and  execute  the  bidding,  selection  and  contracting \nprocesses with the turnkey contractor and the communication \ninfrastructure provider; \n\u2022  monitor  the  turnkey  installation  and  milestone  achievement, \nverify that specifications have been adhered to, review data \nmigration plans, and carry out user acceptance testing;  \n\u2022  review  and  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  technical  and \noperational training provided under the turnkey contract; and \n\u2022  plan and implement the rollout of systems to the whole APB \nbranch network. \nMonitorable Deliverables/Outputs  \u2022  Finalized user requirements;  \n\u2022  Finalized technical specifications;  \n\u2022  Finalized turnkey bidding documents;  \n\u2022  Prequalified bidders;  \n\u2022  Evaluated bids;  \n\u2022  Signed turnkey contract;  \n\u2022  Signed communications contract;  \n\u2022  Turnkey  contract  oversight  reports  from  supervision \nconsultants;  \n\u2022  Signed off user acceptance testing report;  \n\u2022  Signed off data migration report;  \n\u2022  Post implementation review;  \n\u2022  Agreed plan for roll-out of turnkey systems to all APB branches; \nand  \n\u2022  Systems fully operational bank-wide in APB. \nImplementation of Major Activities:  \u2022  Pre-bidding activities for turnkey contract: months 1 to 3; \nNumber of months from grant  \u2022  Bidding and contracting: months 3 to 8 \nactivities  \u2022  Turnkey  contract  implementation,  supervision  and  quality \nassurance: months 9 to 14 \n\u2022  Roll-out of systems to all branches: months 15 to 24 \n \n2.

Genesis \n \nThe  ADB  TA  cluster  3413-LAO1  for  Rural  Finance  Development  has  assisted  the \nGovernment  since  2000  to  begin  to  develop  a  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural  financial \nsystem to contribute to poverty reduction and economic growth. Under the TA cluster, the \nGovernment requested ADB's assistance to transform the state-owned Agriculture Promotion \nBank (APB) into a sustainable, market-oriented rural financial institution. In November 2002, the \nGovernment adopted a new corporate vision for APB to be Lao PDR\u2019s \u201cpremiere rural finance \ninstitution\u201d and to \"operate in a market-oriented, financially self-sustainable way to contribute to \npoverty reduction and the country's economic growth and prosperity.\" Hence, financially self-\nsustainable market-orientation is now the Government's chosen method for APB to contribute to \npoverty  reduction.  Moreover,  under  the  ADB  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program  Loan,2  the \nGovernment recommitted itself to implementing a phased operational and financial restructuring \nplan for APB based on good governance principles to achieve the new corporate vision. This \ncommitment has been reinforced through official Government policy documents, including the \nrecent \u201cPolicy Statement for the Development of Sustainable Rural and Micro Finance Sector\u201d \nand the \u201cNational Poverty Eradication Program\u201d. \nTo  begin  reforming  APB,  Subproject  2  of  the  TA  cluster  (May  to  November  2002) \nconducted (i) a diagnostic review of APB to better understand its strengths and weaknesses in \ncomparison to international best practice, and (ii) a financial audit to better understand its \nfinancial position. Based on the findings, a Restructuring Plan was prepared. The Restructuring \nPlan has six main components: (i) the removal of subsidies and the liberalization of interest \nrates,  (ii)  creation  of  management  autonomy  and  the  termination  of  directed  lending, \n(iii) systematic  workout  of  non-performing  loans,  (iv)  upgrading  of  ICT  systems  and  MIS, \n(v) progressive  recapitalization  based  on  performance;  and  (vi)  a  range  of  inter-related \ninstitution-building initiatives that support the key restructuring activities. Under Subproject 5 \n(March 2003 to June 2004) work commenced in all of these areas except ICT and MIS, which \nwas deferred because of the need to ensure funding was in place for the ICT upgrade. \nAPB  lags  behind  similar  banks  in  the  region  (e.g.,  BAAC  in  Thailand,  VBARD  in \nVietnam, BRI in Indonesia, and RDB in Cambodia) in terms of its ICT and MIS. APB\u2019s current \nICT environment and MIS do not adequately provide any of the systems needed in a modern \nbank.  Specifically:  (i)  there  is  a  lack  of  vision  and  strategy  for  ICT  development,  and \nconsequently no effective plan or budget provision; (ii) the mandate of the ICT unit is not clear is \nrelation to its strategic and planning functions; (iii) none of the systems currently in use at APB \nare able to provide a basic customer information system, making effective risk management and \nperformance assessment impossible; (iv) any new banking products and services can only be \ndeveloped when a comprehensive and integrated core banking system is in place; (v) the ICT \nstaff capacity is inadequate for APB\u2019s current and future needs; (vi) ICT policy and procedures \nare not documented and not enforceable; (vii) ICT security is weak and there is no business \ncontinuity or disaster recovery plan; and (vii) software in many instances is not licensed and is \nthus unsupported. Additionally, there are shortcomings in the management reporting system \nthat make it of limited use for management decision making; the report generation capacity of \npresent software is inadequate for management reporting; current reports are not differentiated \nby user or management level; and the reporting system does not measure bank performance. \nMoreover,  because APB has gone effectively unsupervised by BOL until now, the current \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Rural Finance Development. Manila \n(TA No 3413-LAO). \n2  Approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 28 November 2002. \n ", "102  Appendix 13 \nsystem is inadequate to meet BOL requirements under the new supervision regime of APB, \nwhich will require its treatment as a SOCB subject to full prudential supervision by BOL. \nAccordingly, under the ADB Rural Finance Sector Development Program Loan (being \nprepared  for  approval  in  2006)  includes  a  component  to  upgrade  APB\u2019s  ICT  and  MIS. \nSpecifically, the Government will use the ADB loan to purchase the hardware and software and \nfinance its turnkey installation, while the JFICT grant would finance the associated assistance to \nAPB to oversee and manage the specification and turnkey bidding process and the turnkey \nimplementation  contract,  and  would  build  capacity  in  APB  to  undertake  its  role  in  these \nprocesses and subsequently roll-out systems throughout its network, including training and \ncapacity  building.  The  grant  proposal  was  therefore  conceived  as  an  integral  part  of  a \ncomprehensive program to reform the rural finance system of Lao PDR, and specifically to \ntransform  ABP  into  a  sustainable,  market-oriented  rural  finance  institution.  Moreover,  the \nactivities proposed for JFICT are consistent with ADB\u2019s ICT Strategy, including the development \nof an enabling environment for ICT and improving human resource capacities to use ICT. \n4.  Sustainability \n \nSustainability of APB\u2019s ICT and MIS upgrade is linked to the sustainability of the overall \nAPB reform and restructuring program, which has been developed since 2000 with ADB TA \nassistance under TA cluster 3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development. Through the ongoing TA \ncluster activities, strong Government ownership of the reform program has been established \n(not only for APB\u2019s reforms, but also for microfinance reforms). Indeed, the primary objective of \nthe APB restructuring plan is to transform APB into a sustainable, market-oriented rural finance \ninstitution\u2014in November 2002, the Government adopted a new corporate vision for APB to \n\"operate in a market-oriented, financially self-sustainable way to contribute to poverty reduction \nand the country's economic growth and prosperity.\" \n \nIn this context it is noteworthy that APB was originally established in 1993 as a policy \nbank to channel subsidized credit to Lao farmers. However, APB's outreach has been limited \nbecause it depends on the limited funding available from the Government and donors, and \nbecause its policies, inefficient and subsidized operations, and weak financial condition prevent \nit from mobilizing commercial funding. APB has been operating at a significant loss since it was \nestablished  in  1993,  representing  a  substantial  cost  to  the  Government  budget.  It  is  now \nrecognized that APB\u2019s directed lending policies have distorted the rural finance system and \nresulted  in  misallocation  of  resources,  low  deposit  mobilization,  and  crowding  out  of \nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs)  and  other  banks.  Moreover,  the  Lao  and  international \nexperience demonstrates that the non-poor are the main beneficiaries of subsidized interest \nrates since they have greater access and can absorb larger loans. When subsidized loans are \nnot available, the poor are willing to pay market interest rates, and they tend to value sustained \naccess  more  than  a  low  interest  rate.  Hence,  the  poor  in  particular  will  benefit  from  a \nsustainable, market-oriented APB. \n \nBased  on  their  recognition  of  APB\u2019s  weaknesses,  the  Lao  authorities  have  begun \nrestructuring APB, with ADB support, to transform it into a sustainable, market-oriented rural \nfinance institution. The plan includes phasing out directed lending and interest rate subsidies \nover 3 years, so that APB will become fully financially self-sustainable. The Government has \nalso adopted a new national Policy Statement for Sustainable Rural and Micro Finance, which \nincludes a reaffirmation of its commitment to transform APB into a sustainable, market-oriented \ninstitution and to phase out interest rate subsidies. \n \n ", "Appendix 13  103 \nThe APB reform program, moreover, has been coordinated closely with the Lao Banking \nSector  Reform  Program  Loan  (BSRPL,  ADB  Loan  1946-LAO),  which  was  prepared  in \ncollaboration with the World Bank, IMF, and other donors. This overall banking sector reform \nprogram includes a policy component calling for implementation of the APB restructuring plan. \nMoreover,  BOL\u2019s  Banking  Sector  ICT  Strategy  calls  for  upgrading  APB\u2019s  ICT  and  MIS. \nHowever, it must be noted that APB has, since its creation, been treated differently from the \nState-Owned Commercial Banks (SOCBs)\u2014indeed, APB was established as a \u201cpolicy bank\u201d \nrather than an SOCB. As a result, it has been the subject of its own reform program, which, \nwhile coordinated with BSRPL, has also followed its own path to account for its unique situation. \nWhile APB\u2019s restructuring plan calls for its treatment as an SOCB, it maintains a unique role in \nLao PDR as the Government\u2019s main instrument for delivering financial services to rural areas. \nAs  such,  implementation  of  its  restructuring  plan  is  of  exceptional  importance  to  the \nGovernment, which is keen that sustainability and increased outreach to the poor go hand-in-\nhand. \n \nThe proposed turnkey approach combined with subsequent capacity-building assistance \nto  APB  with  the  roll-out  of  systems  bank-wide  will  ensure  effective  implementation  and \nsustainability of the new ICT and MIS. Moreover, it is expected that the turnkey contract will \ncontain provisions for warranties for 12 months on equipment, 12 months on software from final \nacceptance by APB, and a requirement for a maintenance agreement to specified service levels \nfor a period of five years from the end of the warranty period. Provision for the recurrent costs \nassociated with systems maintenance will be incorporated into APB\u2019s budgets for its corporate \nplan 2006-2008 and in subsequent rolling three-year corporate plans. \n \n5.   Participatory Approach \n \n  An intensive and extensive participatory process has been pursued under TA cluster \n3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development since 2000. Subproject 1 (October 2000 to July 2001) \nincluded,  among  other  activities,  (i)  awareness  creation  workshops  for  local  officials  and \npractitioners, which reviewed international best practice in rural finance; (ii) four guided study \ntours with senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, BOL, the Prime Minister's Office, the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry, and APB to sustainable rural finance institutions in the \nregion; and (iii) preparation and review of a policy and institutional issues paper through a series \nof provincial workshops and a national wrap-up meeting\u2014the policy and institutional issues \npaper identified policy reforms needed in the economic and legal framework and institutional \nstrategies to address the current constraints in rural finance. The overall impact of subproject 1 \nwas positive\u2014knowledge of key issues and best practices in rural and microfinance were \nenhanced,  as  evidenced  by  the  quality  of  policy  dialogue  that  has  ensued  in  preparing \nsubsequent initiatives. Subproject 2 (May to December 2002) conducted a diagnostic study of \nAPB on 12 topics: (i) governance; (ii) strategic planning; (iii) organizational structure; (iv) human \nresources management; (v) pricing policies and procedures; (vi) credit policies and procedures; \n(vii) risk management policies and procedures; (viii) products and demand; (ix) compliance \nreview;  (x)  financial  and  accounting  systems;  (xi)  management  information  systems;  and \n(xii) financial analysis. The diagnostic study also included the first external audit of APB. The \nfindings were reviewed by the Government and ADB and discussed in a 3-day workshop in \nSeptember 2002. This led to the production of a draft restructuring plan for APB in October \n2002. Following a review of the draft by the Government and ADB, a final plan was agreed on in \nDecember 2002. Implementation of the restructuring plan began under subproject 5. Moreover, \nsubproject 4 assisted the Government to prepare: (i) a national policy statement on sustainable \nrural and microfinance, (ii) draft national strategy for rural and microfinance development, and \n(iii)  draft  regulations  for  microfinance  and  prudential  regulations  for  APB.  These  three \n ", "104  Appendix 13 \ndocuments  have  been  discussed  at  three  national  workshops  that  included  central  and \nprovincial  Government  officials,  rural  and  microfinance  practitioners,  international  donors \n(including  World  Bank,  IMF,  JICA,  and  international  NGOs),  and  local  associations.  The \nresulting APB restructuring plan and other documents reflect the inputs of this participatory \nprocess and the local ownership of them. Subproject 6 has carried out a national rural and \nmicrofinance survey, including a survey of 1200 rural households, and some 30 microfinance \npractitioners, and demonstrated that beneficiaries have a strong demand for market-oriented \nfinancial services and are willing to pay market rates for them. \n \n  More specific to APB\u2019s ICT needs, as noted above, the APB diagnostic under subproject \n2 included a diagnostic of APB\u2019s ICT system and recommendations to upgrade, which was \ndiscussed  with  workshop  participants  and  reflected  in  APB\u2019s  restructuring  plan.  Moreover, \nBOL\u2019s ICT Committee held a series of six workshops over three months to develop the banking \nsystem\u2019s overall ICT strategy, of which APB was an integral part. The resulting ICT strategy \ncalls for a complete upgrade of APB\u2019s ICT and MIS. \n \n  APB\u2019s management and Board have been involved in each step of this participatory \nprocess.  Management  and  Board  have  participated  extensively  in  the  preparation  of  the \nRestructuring  Plan  and  the  Corporate  Plan  (both  of  which  contain  provisions  for  the  ICT \nUpgrading) and, where required, have obtained Government approval for the proposals. An \nAPB ICT Needs Review and System Design has been prepared with consultant assistance \nunder  ADB  PPTA  4135-LAO:  Preparing  the  Rural  Finance  Development  Loan.  Extensive \nconsultation has taken place with APB ICT Staff and with the BOL ICT Committee in the system \ndesign to ensure it will integrate with other proposed ICT systems being introduced by BOL at a \ncentral banking level.  \n \nPrimary  beneficiaries  and  other  affected  Other key stakeholders and brief description \ngroups and relevant description \n\u2022  APB management will benefit through access  \u2022  MFIs, which have been crowded out in the \nto accurate and timely management  past by APB\u2019s subsidized operations, will \ninformation that will assist the operations of  benefit from a more equal, competitive playing \nAPB as a market-oriented rural finance  field. \ninstitution.  \u2022  The Government budget will benefit from the \n\u2022  BOL will benefit through better financial  elimination of subsidies to APB, as well as the \nreporting from APB, easing the supervision  elimination of APB\u2019s loss-making activities; as \ntask.  a result, Government resources will be freed \n\u2022  APB\u2019s customers, especially the poor, will  up for better targeted poverty reduction \nbenefit through improved service quality and  programs \nrange of services.   \n \n \n6.  Coordination \n \nCoordination with the World Bank, IMF, JICA, and other donors on the overall rural \nfinance program, including APB restructuring, has been close and frequent. As discussed in part \n6 above, a series of workshops on the Policy Statement, Strategy, and regulatory framework \nhave included the active participation of many donors, including JICA, the World Bank, and IMF. \nThe  World  Bank,  the  international  NGO  Concern  Worldwide,  and  the  Financial  Reform \nStrengthening  Initiative  (FIRST,  a  consortium  of  several  multilateral  and  bilateral  donors) \ncontributed  financing  to  organize  some  of  the  workshops  (ADB  TA  and  the  Government \nprovided the balance of workshop costs). ADB, World Bank, and IMF have cooperated and \ncollaborated extremely closely over the past 3 years in developing a long-term financial sector \n ", "Appendix 13  105 \nreform program for Lao PDR, of which rural and microfinance is an integral component\u2014rural \nand microfinance is incorporated in the World Bank\u2019s Financial Management Adjustment Credit \nand in ADB\u2019s Banking Sector Reform Program Loan, both approved in 2002. AusAid and \nSwedish International Development Agency (Sida) have contributed to the program by financing \naudits of the state-owned commercial banks and APB. JICA has made an important contribution \nto the program through its support for macroeconomic management and state-owned enterprise \nreform through the MAPS program. ADB has hosted donor roundtable discussions in Lao PDR \nto brief donors on ADB activities, to be updated on their program activities, and to coordinate \noverall efforts to reform the rural and microfinance sector. \n \nMore  specific  to  this  JFICT  proposal,  there  has  been  especially  close  coordination \nbetween  ADB  and  the  EU  (and  between  the  ADB  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program  Loan \n[BSRPL] and the ADB Rural Finance TA activities and upcoming loan preparation). Specifically, \nrural finance comprises a small portion of BSRPL; however, BSRPL includes ICT support only \nfor BOL and the two SOCBs (BCEL and LDB). This is because of the separate legal and policy \nstatus of APB, as well as its lower capacity in core banking areas, compared to the SOCBs, \nwhich has required that APB follow a customized reform and restructuring plan. A key aspect of \nAPB\u2019s reform program is to integrate it more fully with the Lao banking sector, and upgrading its \nICT and MIS is a key part of this program.

Rationale for Grant Funding versus ADB Lending \n \nThe  JFICT  grant  will  complement  a  Sector  Development  Loan  for  the  rural  and \nmicrofinance sector, and has been designed in a way to reflect the objectives and policies of the \nGovernment  of  Lao  PDR.  The  Government  generally  seeks  loan  funds  for  investments  in \nconcrete goods and services, while preferring grant financing for training, capacity building, and \nproject support. Despite this preference, the Government will be borrowing from the ADB loan to \n ", "108  Appendix 13 \ncontinue the APB restructuring plan and upgrade BOL\u2019s capacity to supervise MFIs\u2014both \ncomponents are mostly training and capacity building. The Government will also borrow to \npurchase the hardware and software for APB\u2019s ICT and MIS upgrade. The program loan would \nensure  continued  improvements  in  the  policy  and  regulatory  environment  to  support  the \nestablishment and operation of private MFIs.  \n \nThe JFICT grant would finance complementary support to APB to finalize ICT and MIS \nspecifications, to manage the bidding process, and to conduct training and capacity building in \nAPB to implement its new system, strategy, and procedures. Given the Government\u2019s tight fiscal \nposition, the amount the Government is already borrowing for other activities, and the poverty \nfocus of the proposed JFICT activities, it would be difficult for the Government to borrow for the \nproposed activities. However, the overall package demonstrates the Government commitment \nto transforming APB into a sustainable, market-oriented rural finance institution. \n \nD.  Implementation of the Proposed Grant \n \n1.   Provide the Name of the Implementing Agency: Agriculture Promotion Bank \n(APB) \n \nAll procurement under the JFICT grant will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Lao PDR: \n \nThe National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), approved by the National Assembly in October \n2003, identifies access to rural finance as critical to reducing poverty and promoting economic growth. Sustainable \naccess to rural finance is required to support and expand economic activities in the rural areas, where 90% of the \npoor live.  \n \nAt present, the rural financial sector in Lao PDR is poorly developed. While there is demand for rural financial \nservices (i) to support investment in livestock production, agriculture diversification, and other non-farm income-\ngenerating activities; (ii) to finance household emergencies and consumption; and (iii) for secure savings facilities, \naccess is limited. The \u201cBanking and Financial Sector in Lao PDR \u2013 Financial Sector Note\u201d of 2002 prepared by the \nBank of Lao PDR, ADB, and the World Bank, estimates that only 20% of the 800,000 households in Lao PDR have \naccess to some form of formal or semi-formal financial services provided by commercial banks, semi-formal \nmicrofinance initiatives, or village based funds. The remaining 80% have no access to formal financial services. \nFinancial services are mainly available in urban areas and to the better off. In the absence of formal rural financial \nservices, the poor in rural areas often rely on family, friends, traders, moneylenders, and other informal sources. \nThe interest rates charged for borrowing from informal sources are significantly higher than rates from formal \nsources, hindering investments by the poor and further impoverishing them. Furthermore, those in the rural areas \nand the poor hold most of their wealth in risky assets such as livestock, gold, or other in-kind items. Only 1 to 5% of \nrural savings are held as bank deposits. Hence, the level of financial intermediation is extremely low.  \n \nOne reason for the limited outreach of rural financial service is the highly dispersed population and limited \ninfrastructure, resulting in high cost of financial intermediation and information access in rural areas. This challenge \nto expanding rural financial services has been aggravated by the Agriculture Promotion Bank\u2019s (APB's) operations, \nwhich have tended to distort the rural financial system. APB is the Government\u2019s main instrument for delivering \nformal rural financial services. However, APB's operations have been inefficient because of the substantial policy \nlending carried out on behalf of the Government, its subsidized interest rates, and its common practice of rolling \nover loans, dependence on donor and Government funding for its operations, and involvement in non-financial \nservices. Given the subsidized nature of its operations and its weak financial position, APB has not been able to \nmobilize commercial funding to expand its outreach. As the main player in rural finance sector, APB's operation \nhas been crowding out other microfinance institutions\u2014in areas where APB operates, this effect is direct as APB \nundercuts potentially sustainable microfinance institutions (MFIs); in other areas, where APB may not operate, \nAPB has created unrealistic expectations among borrowers about the cost of credit, making it difficult for MFIs to \ncharge sustainable interest rates. Rural financial services have been further constrained by unclear legal and \nregulatory framework for microfinance, making the establishment and operation of MFIs difficult and subject to \narbitrary interference from officials.  \n \nThe Rural Financial Sector Development Program focuses on (i) improving the policy, legal, and regulatory \nframework for microfinance operations; (ii) supporting the ongoing restructuring of APB, transforming it from a \nsubsidized  policy  lending  institution  to  a  market  oriented,  financially  self-sustainable  commercial  bank  with \ncontinued focus on rural areas, in line with the goals of the NGPES; and (iii) supporting new microfinance \ninstitutions in rural areas through establishment of a Microfinance Fund (MFF)\u2014MFF will support microfinance \ninitiatives  that  contribute  directly  and  indirectly  to  increased  income  and  improved  livelihoods  of  the  poor, \nparticularly in the rural areas. The combined program and project loan components will strengthen the rural finance \nsector. It will foster sustainable access to rural financial services by the rural poor, who currently have limited \naccess to formal financial service. Accordingly, sustained access to rural finance will enable the rural poor to invest \nin, and take advantage of, the opportunities in farm and non-farm income generating activities. \n \n \n \n \n ", "120    Appendix 14 \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nExisting information indicates that the number of poor with access to formal financial services is limited while the \ndemand is high. A household survey undertaken in early 2004 confirm the limited access to formal and informal \nfinancial services, the need and demand for formal rural financial services, attitude towards different types and \nproviders of financial services, and ability and willingness to pay for services and repay borrowing. Analysis is \nbeing further disaggregated by poverty status, family size, educational attainment, gender, and ethnic groupings. \nPreliminary results confirm that the poor have less access to formal financial services than the less poor. This \ninformation will help determine what types of microfinance institutions and financial services may be most effective \nin  reaching  the  poor  in  rural  areas  and  meeting  their  needs,  and  thus  should  be  supported  through  the \nMicrofinance Fund. \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \n \nThe Program and Project loans  will involve the participation of the  Bank of Lao  PDR (BOL), APB, other \nGovernment ministries and agencies, NGOs, various funding agencies providing microfinance services in rural \nareas, and existing and potential clients. A diagnostic assessment of APB was undertaken in 2002, which is the \nbasis of its restructuring plan. An analysis of the policy, legal, and regulatory framework, and BOL\u2019s capacity to \nimplement an improved framework, was undertaken in 2003-04. A sample household survey was undertaken to \nassess the demand and need for rural financial services, attitudes towards different financial services, and ability to \npay for services and to repay any borrowings. The results are being disaggregated by family size, gender, ethnic \ngroupings, poverty status, and educational attainment. It will enable better understanding of the types of rural \nfinancial services required and appropriate mode of service delivery. A comprehensive review of existing rural \nfinance providers, focusing on NGOs, is also taking place to provide a comprehensive picture of the status of rural \nfinance sector. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \n \nA consultative approach has been adapted for preparation and implementation of the Program and Project loans. \nThe policy framework for rural finance including the Policy Statement for the Development of Sustainable Rural \nand  Micro  Finance  Sector  and  the  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  for  the  Promotion  of  Sustainable  Rural  and \nMicrofinance has been prepared through a participatory process involving the Government, donors, NGOs, \npractitioners, and clients. The restructuring of APB, which was initiated by ADB technical assistance and will \ncontinue under the Program and Project Loans, is being undertaken in consultation with Government, key donors, \nNGOs, and staff of APB. The MFF supported under the Project Loan will promote the expanded participation of \nMFIs as providers of financial services in rural areas. The MFF will support MFIs that promote equitable access to \nfinancial services by women and ethnic groups. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen have an important role in ensuring the livelihoods of their families. According to the LECS II (1997-1998), \nand analysis of gender and time use, women work more than men on income generating activities and household \nlabor. According to the Study on Integrating Human Concerns in Local Development in Three Provinces of Lao \nPDR (April 2002) prepared by the Committee for Planning and Cooperation in partnership with United Nations \nCenter for Regional Development, women identified economic threats as a key source of vulnerability. Thus, \nensuring women's sustainable access to financial services will enable them to cope with household emergencies \nand economic threats, as well as to invest in income generating activities that benefit the family.  \n \nHowever, given the noticeable differences between men and women in their education attainment, public role, \nfamily attitudes and responsibilities, women generally have less direct access to formal financial services. The \nProgram  and  Project  loans  are  expected  to  strengthen  the  rural  financial  sector,  which  will  encourage \nestablishment and sustained operations of MFIs that will serve the needs of the rural poor, both men and women. \nGiven the constraints faced by women to access formal financial services, the MFF has an important role in \npromoting MFIs that target women. Accordingly, piloting and supporting microfinance initiatives that promote \nequitable participation of women will be prioritized, subject to the MFI\u2019s focus on sustainability.  \n ", "Appendix 14  121 \n \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes   No \n \nThe  outline  procedures  for  the  MFF  articulates  that  for  those  microfinance  initiatives  that  meet  the  legal, \nmanagement, governance, and fiduciary criteria for support, preference will be given to those that benefit women \nand ethnic groups.  \nE.
