In April 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved an increase in the aggregate \nlimit for the Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program (MFP) by $260 million to \n$600 million.1 MFP is a credit enhancement initiative designed to address market gaps by sharing \nrisks to facilitate local currency lending to microfinance institutions (MFIs), which on-lend to low-\nincome people who face difficulties in gaining access to finance. Operating on a revolving basis, \nthe MFP has supported $1.18 billion in new local currency loans since inception in 2010 to end-\n2019, benefiting over 6 million end-borrowers, mostly women, across ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, MFP seeks to support MFIs that are partners of \nthe program by building resilience during the post-pandemic period and help sustain continued \nfinancing of the most vulnerable low-income population in ADB\u2019s developing member countries \n(DMCs).2 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification  \n \n2.  Lower-income people find it difficult to borrow from formal lending sources for various \nreasons including small loan amounts that are challenging and expensive for banks to administer, \nthe lack of proper identification, and the absence of a credit history and collateral. Microfinance \nhas been a critical tool in addressing this market gap and reducing poverty by providing financial \nservices to low-income people, particularly women. However, MFIs and other organizations that \ncater to this market segment struggle to obtain sufficient commercial funding, particularly in local \ncurrency, to meet the vast demand from their client base. In India, larger MFIs and NBFIs are \nstarting to access capital markets, with credit enhancements to improve ratings and lower risks \nfor investors, as they seek to diversify their funding options. But MFIs/NBFIs still need access to \nstandard wholesale commercial financing to on-lend to low-income borrowers. The aim of the \nMFP is to sustain the flow of wholesale finance by partner financial institutions (PFIs) so that \nselected MFIs/NBFIs can continue their on-lending operations, service their debt obligations, and \nmeet the financial needs of low-income populations. However, in periods of social and economic \nduress  triggered  by  systemic  shocks  like  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  economic  activity  and \nmovement is drastically reduced, low-income borrowers are unable to engage in productive \neconomic activity and MFIs/NBFIs are unable to collect loan repayments, up to 90% of which are \nrecovered in cash directly from their clients where they live.  \n \n3.  This results in a further widening of gaps in access to fair and transparent finance for the \npoor and under-served segments of DMCs. The risk appetite of the PFIs is reduced by the \nweakened macro-economic conditions and rising non-performing loans reinforcing the banking \nsector\u2019s natural defensive response to curtail lending to MFIs/NBFIs, which are often perceived \nto be higher risk borrowers. The lead time for normalcy to return and for private capital to flow \nback to underserved low-income borrowers during times of economic shock is substantial and is \nexpected to be even longer in the post-COVID-19 recovery period. Given the vulnerable situation \nof the borrowers and the distressed conditions, it is also vital that MFIs/NBFIs adhere to fair \nlending  practices,  and  safeguard  the  rights  and  privileges  of  these  borrowers,  in  these \ncircumstances. \n \n \n1  ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  \n2  MFP considers MFIs to be NBFI-MFIs, NBFIs, non-government organizations, cooperatives and other institutions \nthat lend to the low-income population in ADB DMCs. \n ", "2 \n4.  Amid the large-scale economic disruption following the outbreak, the lower tolerance of \nrisk and the threat of diminishing funding sources tends to impact microfinance institutions \nsignificantly. The operational challenges arising from difficult circumstances means that standards \ncan become compromised but they can also provide the opportunity for change and improvement, \nsuch as instilling fair lending practices. This technical assistance (TA) therefore proposes timely \nintervention  as  economic  activity  and  income-generating  opportunities  resume  in  the  post-\nlockdown period. It will help these MFIs/NBFIs: a) build their capacity and resilience; b) secure \ncontinued  financing  by wholesale  investors  to ensure  on-lending  to  low-income  borrowers;  \nc) promote continuity of lending and collection activity for clients, assisting them through periods \nof economic and personal distress with awareness and sensitivity; and d) prepare for future crisis-\nrelated scenarios. \n \n5.  To maximize its impact, and in line with PSOD\u2019s support of greater financial inclusion as \ndescribed in Strategy 20303, the TA is therefore substantially directed towards small and mid-\nsized MFIs/NBFIs that traditionally serve rural and peri-urban borrowers, as well as a high \nproportion of women, in more remote areas where there are no or very limited alternative means \nof finance.  MFIs are at most risk from the withdrawal of funding from wholesale lenders and are \nalso likely to have the least expertise to respond in a crisis scenario. They are therefore more \nlikely to fail as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak posing a severe risk to household income \ngeneration by those with no alternative access to the regulated financial sector. MFIs whose \nclients are affected by the impact of the pandemic will be selected in consultation with MFP\u2019s PFIs \nbecause of their strong relationships as wholesale lenders to these institutions and to underpin \nMFP\u2019s increased facility limit approved by the ADB as part of its comprehensive response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The MFIs/NBFIs selected will be existing approved obligors of the MFP \nand/or those under proposal and demonstrating strong potential, with a strategic vision that aims \nto meet the needs of low-income borrowers which includes maintaining best practice in customer \nprotection  and  responsible  lending,  aligned  with  well-established  standards  like  the  former \nSMART Campaign\u2019s Client Protection Principles, now incorporated in the Universal Standards for \nResponsible and Inclusive Lending  promoted by SPTF and CERISE.4 To meet the needs of \nqualifying MFIs as they evolve in the dynamic post-pandemic period, the aims of the TA are three-\nfold and subject to the assessment of training needs and availability of the TA\u2019s resources: i) to \nconduct due diligence and institutional assessments of MFIs to ensure that MFP facilities are \nmaintained and increased and that new MFIs are on-boarded; ii) to improve and strengthen fair \nlending practices and client protection principles of MFIs; and iii) to provide capacity-building \nassessment and advisory services for the development of a more robust response of MFIs to \nfuture crisis-rated scenarios. Target countries for the selected MFIs include Bangladesh, India, \nand Myanmar. By engaging certified and reputable technical partners to work directly with the \nselected MFI/NBFI names, the proposed TA aims to strengthen the institutional and operational \ncapabilities of MFIs to secure continued financing by wholesale investors to ensure on-lending to \nlow-income borrowers. The scope of the TA will include: \n \na.  Business  continuity  planning  (BCP):  Activities  to  be  conducted  under  this \ncomponent include: i) provision of advice for board and senior management to prepare for \nperiods of economic and social disruption in alignment with long term strategic aims;  \nii) portfolio analysis based on the changed economic landscape and prospects for different \nsub-sectors; iii) asset and liability management advisory including the formulation of \nrestructuring policies; iv) support in the prudent  revision of credit policies and approval \n \n3  ADB. 2018.

Communication and Change Management: Activities to be conducted under this \ncomponent  include:  i)  preparing  staff  to  respond  with  agility,  professionalism  and \nsensitivity in differing scenarios; ii) helping staff to communicate with borrowers on a \nregular and detailed basis that reassures, guides and shows that lenders are working in \nthe long-term interests of clients; iii) devising consistent messaging to the media and \ninvestors to raise awareness of MFI activities, show leadership in the community and help \nsecure refinancing opportunities.  \n \nc.  Institutional assessment of selected MFIs/NBFIs on the areas of risk management, \ninternal control and audit, MIS and management reporting, information technology and \nusage of alternate arrangements aligned with pandemic-mitigation measures, to assess \ntheir institutional preparedness during economic and social disruptions. These findings \nwould be the basis of follow-on training and capacity building programs for the participating \nMFIs/NBFIs and would also be additional and critical inputs in ADB\u2019s on-boarding process \nunder the program.  \n \nd.  Promoting gender equity by identifying and addressing specific needs emerging \nfrom women borrowers, especially in under-served areas, such as non-discrimination in \nthe access to finance, the right to responsible lending practices and the availability of high \nquality training in financial products and literacy. MFIs will be assisted in adapting their \npolicies and systems to close gender gaps and to incorporate gender analysis in their \nportfolio monitoring, reporting and forecasting. MFI employees, including directors, senior \nmanagers and field staff, will be provided with training, tailored to each institution\u2019s needs, \nto raise awareness, and uphold the principles of, gender equality.  \n \ne.  The implementation of the Universal Standards for responsible, inclusive finance \nwhich includes: i) assessment of MFIs\u2019 fair lending practices; and ii) recommendation and \nimplementation of the introduction or revision of lending policies and practices and, where \ndeemed appropriate, staff-training and capacity-building needs, aimed at attaining and \nmaintaining  these  standards.  For  clarity,  the  Universal  Standards'  framework  is \nsummarized in Table 1 below:  \n \nTable 1: Universal Standards for Responsible Inclusive Finance  \n\u2022  Define and Monitor Social Goals  \nThe provider has a strategy to achieve and collects and discloses accurate client data specific to its \nsocial goals.  \n \n\u2022  Ensure Board, Management and Employee Commitment to Social Goals Members of the board \nof directors hold the provider accountable to its mission and social goals.

Its products, \nservices and delivery channels are designed to benefit clients, in line with the provider\u2019s social goals. \n \n ", "4 \n\u2022  Treat  Clients  Responsibly  Covers  issues  such  as  the  prevention  of  over-indebtedness, \ntransparency, fair and respectful treatment of clients, privacy of client data, and mechanisms for \ncomplaints resolution. \n \n\u2022  Treat Employees Responsibly \nThe provider follows a written Human Resources policy that protects employees and creates a \nsupportive working environment. It communicates to all employees the terms of their employment, \nprovides training for essential job functions and monitors employee satisfaction and turnover. \n  \n\u2022  Balance Financial and Social Performance The provider sets and monitors growth rates that \npromote both institutional sustainability and social goals. Equity investors, lenders, board and \nmanagement are aligned on the provider\u2019s social goals and implement an appropriate financial \nstructure in its mix of sources, terms, and desired returns. The provider sets prices responsibly and \ncompensates senior managers in a way that is appropriate to a provider with stated social goals.  \nSource: The Social Performance Task Force \n \nf.  Collecting and recording data on: i) the ramifications of the pandemic outbreak on \nMFI staff, operational capabilities, clients and investors; ii) the altered risk profile for the \nselected MFIs; iii) the identification of needs and pathways that equip selected MFIs to \nmanage the impact of the outbreak; iv) how the recommendations enabled the MFIs to \nassist their borrowers in resuming business activity; and v) new learnings arising from the \npost pandemic period as a result of the TA. \n \n6.  This proposal, targeted at the more vulnerable MFIs in the Program, operating mainly in \nrural areas, will complement the deployment of existing TA.5 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.
