INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The midterm review of the long-term strategic framework of the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  and  the  Environment  Operational  Directions,  2013\u20132020  have  identified \nstrengthening environmental governance in developing member countries (DMCs) as a priority \narea.1 Policies,  regulatory  frameworks,  and  the  structure  of  incentives  need  to  be  more \neffectively  aligned  to  promote  greater  resource  efficiency,  abate  pollution,  and  reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. With its strong focus on environmental management, the 2030 \nAgenda  for  Sustainable  Development\u2014specifically  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals \n(SDGs)\u2014reaffirms these priorities.2 Estimates of financing to meet SDG targets show that public \nsector and international development assistance will not be sufficient. The private sector needs \nto continue to change and contribute additional resources. \n \n2.  Improving environmental governance is of interest to several DMCs that are dealing with \nenvironmental problems across various issues and seeking approaches that support effective \nimplementation  of  DMCs\u2019  strategies  for  environmentally  sustainable  or  green  growth.  This \ntechnical assistance (TA) is designed to catalyze the adoption and scaling up of innovative \napproaches in two areas: (i) the use of market-based approaches (MBAs) and other flexible \npolicies for environmental management, and (ii) the development of green businesses. It will \nundertake  targeted  research  activities  on  the  applicability  of  market-based  instruments  in \naddressing environmental problems in DMCs, and opportunities to expand green businesses in \nthe region. Using research outputs, the TA will carry out structured knowledge sharing events \nand develop strategies and/or action plans and road maps to stimulate decisions and/or actions \nin DMCs toward the adoption of environmental management approaches and establishment of \ngreen businesses. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The SDGs prominently feature environmental sustainability. Goals 12\u201315 deal with the \nenvironment and climate change directly, and goals 6\u201311 are linked to environmental goals \nindirectly. The United Nations Open Working Group\u2019s estimates suggest that financing the \nSDGs will be a significant challenge that cannot be met by relying solely on traditional public \nsector financing. Private sector finance will be critical to initiating and scaling up measures that \npromote environmental sustainability. Opportunities abound for private sector involvement. The \nWorld Business Council for Sustainable Development estimates that under the right policies, \ngreen business in the natural resources management, health, and education sectors could \nreach $500 billion to $1.5 trillion per annum globally by 2020.4 \n \n4.  Environmental management in most developing countries is characterized by weakly \nenforced environmental regulations\u2014typically, command-and-control approaches5\u2014to pursuing \nchosen  objectives.  However,  exclusive  or  overwhelming  reliance  on  command-and-control \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Geneva. \n5  The direct regulation of an industry or activity by legislation that states what is permitted and illegal. \n ", " \n2   \ncould result in rigidity and a high compliance cost as the regulated community cannot make use \nof technological and management opportunities to achieve compliance more flexibly at a lower \ncost. Reflecting pressure from enterprises to lower the compliance cost, other approaches have \nemerged, including MBAs and flexible policy instruments.6 Initiatives that use new monitoring \nand information technology, expanded transparency, and innovative enforcement approaches \n(such  as  Next  Generation  Compliance)  are  being  implemented.7 The  early  experience  of \napplying alternative or complementary approaches to environmental regulation in Asia and the \nPacific and elsewhere deserves to be carefully studied in order to draw policy- and practice-\nrelated lessons and assess their applicability to individual or suitably grouped DMCs.8 Initial \nexperience  from  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD) \ncountries shows that while command-and-control approaches remain effective in certain sectors \n(e.g., emission standards in cars and buildings), alternative approaches may be more suitable in \nothers. Experience in assessing the suitability of different policy instruments in country-specific \nconditions is seriously limited in DMCs in Asia, and this gap needs to be addressed. \n \n5.  The TA seeks to build on and capture the experience of growing corporate willingness to \nwork  in  partnership  with  governments  and  other  stakeholders  for  better  environmental \nmanagement, focusing on a range of environmental issues in the region. Wetland banking in \nCalifornia (with its marketable \u201cwetland credits\u201d), tradable biodiversity credits, ecosystem service \npayments,  voluntary  standards,  and  certification  schemes  are  examples  of  private  sector \ninitiatives and voluntary agreements.9 These and other incentive-based policy measures offer \nattractive additions to command-and-control regulatory fundamentals, and have the potential to \nbecome a vital component of the environmental management tool kit in developing countries. \n6.  At the same time, the global sustainable development agenda, green urbanization, and \nresponses to resource scarcity and environmental degradation create major opportunities in \ngreen business segments. Benefiting from suitable regulatory and incentive regimes, green \nbusinesses  are  emerging,  supported  by  large  corporations  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises in both advanced and developing economies. They are involved in clean production, \nenergy-efficient  processes,  new  technologies,  manufacturing  methods  and  products,  and \nsustainability  of  supply  chains.  These  resource-efficient  businesses  already  contribute  to \neconomic growth and can become powerful engines for future growth in the region. Recognizing \nthe growing number of venues and partnerships that facilitate the exchange of green business-\nrelated lessons in Asia and the Pacific, this TA will focus on those that will reduce resource use \nand  environmental  damage,  such  as  sustainable  forest  management,  waste  management, \nclimate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  (especially  ecosystem-based  adaptation),10 green \nurban development, ecotourism, and sustainable agriculture and food value chains. Special \nattention will be paid to policy preconditions for successful green business.  \n                                                \n6  These include pollution discharge fees, pollution trading, fiscal tools, performance guarantee bonds, voluntary \nenvironmental performance standards, payment for environmental services, and transferable development rights.  \n7  Next Generation Compliance is the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s strategy to bring together the \nbest  thinking  on  how  to  structure  regulations  and  permits  combined  with  new  monitoring  and  information \ntechnology, expanded transparency, and innovative enforcement. \n8  ADB. 1998.

These were among several ADB TA \nprojects that focused on market-based instruments. Both TA projects highlighted opportunities to use market-based \napproaches for environmental management (MBAEMs) and the need to focus on managing specific environmental \nproblems in DMCs while applying policy instruments. \n9  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). 2012.

In  summary,  two  major  challenges  demand  priority  attention  and  action.  First, \nenvironmental regulation needs to be made more efficient, effective, and innovation-friendly. To \nthis end, it is crucial to build on command-and-control regulatory systems, enhance these with \nNext Generation Compliance methods, and adopt, where feasible, more market-based and \nvoluntary approaches for environmental management. Second, given the urgency to narrow the \nSDG environmental investment gap where public resources are limited, green business must be \nstimulated, knowledge exchanged, and policies instituted that nurture private sector investments \nin green growth. To understand the links between DMCs\u2019 environmental policies and the growth \nof green business (or lack thereof), events and forums in the region should be promoted where \ngovernment officials, investors, experts, and practitioners from the region and  beyond can \ndiscuss policies and exchange knowledge that can facilitate green growth and investments in \ngreen businesses. The TA is aligned with the work program of the Environment Thematic Group \n(ETG) on knowledge for environmental governance. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n8.  The impact will be improved environmental performance in Asia and the Pacific. The \noutcome will be public and private stakeholders\u2019 knowledge on the applicability of market-based \napproaches for  environmental management (MBAEMs)  and  opportunities for green  business \nincreased. The TA will conduct research on the applicability of various voluntary and incentive-\nbased  approaches  and  the  use  of  new  monitoring  and  information  technologies,  expanded \ntransparency,  and  other  innovative  approaches  to  make  environmental  management  more \neffective  and  efficient;  and  promote  other  MBAs  such  as  wetland  banking  and  ecological \ncompensation  schemes,  including  payments  for  ecosystem  services,  and  a  range  of  new \ninitiatives and programs to promote green business engagement and investments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will have three key outputs. \n \n10.  Output 1: Knowledge products developed and disseminated. The TA will conduct \nresearch and disseminate knowledge as follows: \n \n(i)  Applicability of market-based approaches for environmental management \nin  Asian  countries  studied.  The  TA  will  undertake  a  regional  review  and \nstocktaking  on  the  use  of  MBAEMs  and  other  voluntary  and  flexible  policy \napproaches, building on existing research including sources from outside the \nregion, such as the OECD. The review will focus on the use of MBAEMs to \naddress key environmental challenges in the region, including pollution control \nand  prevention,  biodiversity  conservation,  watershed  management,  and \nsustainable urban development. Analysis will focus on the applicability and/or \npotential to scale up the use of MBAEMs in other DMCs, where feasible to a \nbroader range of environmental problems. ADB will engage experts to prepare \nand deliver papers analyzing experience in the design, use, and performance of \nthese  instruments  and  approaches  in  addressing  environmental  problems  in \ndiverse institutional contexts, and make recommendations for their application in \nspecific DMCs. The draft findings will be reviewed in a 2-day workshop attended \nby ADB staff and DMC officials from relevant government offices (to be identified \nduring  TA  implementation).  The  analysis  and  key  recommendations  will  be \n ", " \n4   \nsummarized in a flagship study. Recommendations will cover new directions for \napplying  MBAs  and  flexible  policy  instruments,  particularly  in  middle-income \ncountries  in  Asia.  The  study\u2019s  findings  will  be  disseminated  via  several \nknowledge sharing activities. Information will be collected for the OECD database \non  instruments  used  for  environmental  policy  and  natural  resources \nmanagement. \n(ii)  Opportunities and challenges for green business in the region developed. \nThe TA will review green business sectors operating globally and regionally, \nfocusing on those providing products and services that reduce resource use and \nenvironmental  damage,  such  as  waste  management,  pollution  control  and \nprevention, ecotourism, and sustainable agriculture and food production. The \nfindings will be compiled in a green business stocktaking report. As input to the \nreport and the green business forum, six or seven background papers will be \ndeveloped on how best to promote green business investments in Asia and the \nPacific, focusing on priority sectors and topics: (a) reform of the policy regulatory \nframework; (b) access to credit and/or finance; (c) technology exchange and \ntransfer; (d) complementary green services (advisory, technical support, auditing \nand/or diagnostic work, financial consulting services, energy service companies); \n(e)  networking,  matchmaking,  brokering,  and  setting  up  a  marketplace; \n(f) working with small and medium-sized enterprises and supporting the informal \nsector  and/or  microenterprises;  (g)  certification,  codes  of  conduct,  and \nperformance  standards;  and  (h)  role  of  industry  organizations,  chambers  of \ncommerce, and sector associations. \n  \n11.  Output  2:  Pilot  country  road  maps  toward  greater  use  of  market-based \napproaches for environmental management developed for two or three DMCs. ETG and \noperations departments will prepare the selection criteria for DMCs to be assisted in preparing \ncountry road maps. The criteria will include (i) interest in making MBAEMs a component of \nnational environmental management; (ii) record of previous involvement in MBAEMs through \nresearch, training,  and use;  (iii)  existence  of  domestic capacity  to  support  the  analysis  of \nMBAEM options; (iv) willingness to engage in reforms; and (v) recent economic development \npatterns that suggest a case may exist to pilot test and ultimately introduce MBAEMs. The pilot \ncountry road maps will help DMCs, through technical advice and knowledge support, identify \nenvironmental  performance  targets,  develop  a  strategic  plan  (including  market-based  tools \nand/or approaches) to achieve these targets, and determine the actions needed to implement \nthe plan. The preparation of road maps will enhance client countries\u2019 knowledge and provide \nopportunities for targeted capacity building. DMCs have shown strong interest in this output.11 \nLessons generated will be disseminated in knowledge sharing events. \n \n12.  Output 3: Flagship event on green business held. A flagship event, the first Green \nBusiness Forum at ADB, will be organized in 2016 at ADB headquarters. At least 100 business \nleaders and professionals and 50 government officials are expected to participate. The forum \nproceedings, containing key background papers, will be published in 2017. For this task, ADB \nwill identify knowledge partner institutions with experience in, or useful data on, the study \ntopics.12 To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the TA and its \n                                                \n11 Based on discussions with DMC officials at the Regional Conference on \u201cNext Generation Compliance in Asia\u201d \norganized by the Asian Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Network in September 2015.   \n12 Cooperation may be established with the Asian Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Network, United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature, UNEP, World Resources Institute, and World Wildlife Fund. \n ", "  5 \noutputs, resource persons who are experts in their fields will be engaged to improve analytical \nrigor and strengthen the relevance of the outputs. \n \n13.  Potential risks are identified in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). To \nminimize these risks, the TA will (i) design suitable knowledge dissemination activities for the \nprivate  sector;  and  (ii)  collaborate  with  development  partners  on  topics  of  shared  interest \n(e.g., the United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] on MBAEMs and green business) \nand/or where previous work has been done. Informal consultations have been carried out with \nsome  DMCs  and  development  partners  (e.g.,  the  Asian  Environmental  Compliance  and \nEnforcement Network, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific, and UNEP) on the use of MBAEMs. Using environment thematic assessments as an \nentry point, further consultations will be  carried out with DMCs that are preparing  country \npartnership strategies (e.g., the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic). ADB will ensure that key \nDMC  stakeholders  will  be  engaged  in  developing  country  road  maps.  Knowledge  sharing \nactivities will be provided to address knowledge and capacity gaps. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA, which will be implemented by ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department, led by the ETG.13 The ETG will \nconsult  with  relevant  departments  (e.g.,  East  Asia  Department,  Economic  Research  and \nRegional Cooperation Department, Southeast Asia Department) in preparing the knowledge \nand/or research framework, carrying out research activities, and developing country road maps \non the use of MBAEMs with sector and thematic groups (e.g., rural development and food \nsecurity, finance, urban, and water) particularly on identifying opportunities for green businesses. \nADB will collaborate with development partners with experience, knowledge, and/or useful data \non the TA research topics. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  March  2016  to  August  2018.  An  indicative \nimplementation  schedule  is  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  The  TA  will  require \n58 person-months of international consultants and 57 person-months of national consultants. \nADB will engage the consultants and resource persons in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Technical reports, country road maps, and the proceedings of the \nADB Green Business Forum will be disseminated as knowledge products through workshops, \nstakeholder meetings, and relevant knowledge hubs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Scaling  Up  Private  Sector  Participation  and  Use  of  Market-Based  Approaches  for \nEnvironmental Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n13 An Environment and Safeguards Division staff member will act as the TA team leader.  \n ", "6   Appendix 1                                \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nImproved environmental performance in Asia and the Pacific (defined by the project) \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nPublic and private  a.
