Having  witnessed  increased  momentum  in  the  South  Asia  Subregion  for regional \neconomic cooperation (e.g., South Asia free trade area and South Asia growth quadrangle \nconcepts), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) decided to extend two-phased regional technical \nassistance (RETA) for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) to promote \nsubregional  cooperation  among  the  countries  there.  In  2001,  four  countries  (Bangladesh, \nBhutan, India, and Nepal) confirmed their participation in the transport sector component of the \nRETA. With this confirmation, the Transport Working Group (TWG) was established in 2001, \nwhich carried out the sector overview as part of the  phase I activities. The sector overview \nidentified that institutional or operational impediments, together with physical deficiencies of \nsystems, greatly hamper efficient operations of subregional corridors, and recommended that an \nin-depth  analysis  be  carried  out  to  identify  corridor-specific  institutional  and  physical \nimpediments under phase II activities. The recommendation was endorsed by the Country \nAdvisors\u2019 Meeting held in October 2002. A  TA Fact-Finding Mission1 was sent in December \n2002 to Nepal, a hosting country of the TWG activities, to define the scope of the RETA for the \nSubregional Corridor Operational Efficiency Study in the South Asia Subregion (the current \nRETA).2 This paper was prepared based on the findings and understandings of the Mission. The \nlogical framework of the RETA is given in Appendix 1. The RETA is included in the 2003 Status \nReport for SARD Subregional Cooperation Strategy and Program.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Transport plays a critical role in subregional economic cooperation. Better transport \nconnections would enable SASEC countries to be physically and commercially linked to each \nother. This would potentially serve as a springboard for the future integration of the SASEC \nsubregion into the global trade regime.   \n \n3.  A salient feature of the subregion is the existence of two landlocked countries, Nepal \nand Bhutan. These countries need access to seaports via India or via India and Bangladesh \ncombined. India is important not only as a transit country, but also as a major trading partner for \nthese countries. About 50% of Nepalese trade and 90% of Bhutanese trade is to and from India.  \nLocated in the eastern part of the SASEC region, Bangladesh can provide the landlocked \ncountries with alternative access to seaports, and can potentially offer a shortcut to the sea for \nthe northeastern states of India.  \n \n4.  SASEC  countries  are  connected  with  each  other  through  bilaterally  agreed  upon \ncorridors. Many of them are roadbased, such as (i) Kathumandu-Birgunj/Raxaul-Kolkata/Haldia, \n(ii)  Kathumandu-Kharkabhitta-Phulvari/Banglabandh-Dhaka/Mongla,  (iii)  Kolkata-Petrapole/ \nBenapole-Dhakha,  (iv)  Thimpu-Phuensholing/Jaigaon-Kolkata/Haldia,  and  (iv)  Thimpu-\nPhuensholing/Jaigoon-Burimari-Dhaka.  Some  are  rail  based,  such  as  Kathumandu-Birgunj-\nMumbai, while some are inland waterway based, such as  Kolkata-Sunderban-(Buramputra \nRiver)-Assam.  \n \n5.  The overall performance of these corridors is not particularly impressive. The time and \ncost required for moving cargo along these corridors are much higher than those of rival \neconomies in Asia. For instance, total transport and processing costs of carpet from Kathmandu \n                                                 \n1 The Mission consisted of S. Tsukada (senior transport specialist/team leader, SAID) and B. Karmacharya (SASEC \nconsultant, NRM). \n2  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, Internet edition, on 16 August 2002. ", "2  \nto Bremen in Germany are $2,651, of which 55% is the inland leg of transportation and \nprocessing costs including handling costs at the Port of Kolkata. Another example of inefficient \ncross-border operation is the Kolkata-Petrapol/Benapol-Dhaka corridor, which provides a major \nconnection between the eastern part of India and Bangladesh. This 300-kilometer corridor takes \n3\u20136 days to get Kolkata-originating cargoes to reach Dhaka, which would take 2 days in rival \neconomies. Problems are not only time of transportation, but also its unpredictability, thus \nrequiring higher levels of inventory at factories and/or warehouses.   \n \n6.  This  lower-than-expected  performance  is  due  to  a  number  of  interrelated  factors.  \nAdministratively, customs clearance and other cross-border inspections are cumbersome and \ntime consuming. They are neither transparent nor consistent, which has led to the payment of \nirregular/informal fees and to other rent-seeking activities. Operationally, intermodal operations \nare still in a rudimentary stage. Traditional business relationships play an even more important \nrole  than  competition  among  operators/intermediaries  for  lower  prices  and  higher  quality \nservices. Indian, Nepalese, and Bhutanese trucks are not allowed to enter into Bangladesh, \nnecessitating the transfer of cargoes at the Bangladesh border, while the same restriction is \napplied to Bangladeshi trucks heading to India. Physically, loading and unloading facilities are \nnot adequately available at key gateway points. Proper channeling facilities do not exist at the \nkey cross-border points, resulting in a long back-up of trucks at the borders. Poor conditions of \naccess roads to borders present another impediment to smoother cross-border movement of \ncargoes.  \n \n7.  These problems might be resolved by stricter implementation of the current bilateral \ntransport/transit agreements.  With streamlined procedures and provision of necessary facilities \nat key cross-border and/or transshipment points, visible improvement may take place. The \nproposed choke point study would look into this issue in detail. In the longer run, the current \nperformance of the existing corridors could be significantly improved by the introduction of \ninternational best practices such as the transport international routier (TIR) carnet system, which \nwould  enable  trucks  of  various  nationalities  to  move  across  several  countries,  the \nstandardization of documentation requirements, the modernization of inland container transport \nsystems,  and  the  introduction  of  information  technology  (IT)  such  as  electronic  data \ninterchanges (EDI).   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The overall goal of TWG activities is the establishment of modernized transit/transport \nsystems compatible with international practices so that the SASEC subregion can be effectively \nintegrated in the global trade scheme. This will require review of the trade logistic systems \nconnecting  (i)  SASEC  countries  to  each  other,  (ii)  a  landlocked  SASEC  country  to  third \ncountries, and (iii) a coastal SASEC country to third countries.  \n \n9.  Under this framework, the RETA will aim at identifying specific measures to enhance the \nefficiency of individual subregional corridors with particular emphasis on the solution of choke \npoint problems at key land-based and sea-based gateways and removal of institutional and \noperational impediments. The RETA will also aim at developing project concepts so as to \nfacilitate future financing by multilateral/bilateral aid agencies.  \n ", "  3\nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The RETA will consist of the following components, to be implemented in sequence:  \n \n11.  Part 1: Selection of subregional corridors to be studied under phase II activities. \nThe RETA would commence with the selection of subregional corridors. Possible selection \ncriteria include (i) corridors that have served the subregion as major physical link, (ii) those that \nwould offer alternatives to major subregional physical links with significant cost/time savings, \nand (iii) those that would improve the transport/transit system in the areas at crossroads such as \nWest Bengal and Assam. An important element of corridor selection is that these subregional \ncorridors have already been included in transit/transport agreements or in other similar bilateral \nagreements.  \n \n12.  The consultants will develop a list of possible subregional corridors to be included in the \nSASEC framework. From this list, the consultants will select those corridors to be examined in \nthe  phase  II  study.  The  total  number  of  corridors  to  be  studied  will  not  exceed  six  in \nconsideration of the limited availability of time and resources. These lists will be examined and \nfinalized in a workshop to be held before proceeding to field visits. The workshop will be \ncomposed of one representative from each member country, the consultants, and ADB staff.  \n \n13.  Part 2: Evaluation of operational efficiency of individual subregional corridors. \nThe  consultants  will  assess  the  operational  efficiency  of  each  subregional  corridor  in  the \nfollowing manner: \n \n(i)  Review  and  describe  current  bilateral/trilateral/other  transit  arrangements  for \neach subregional corridor. \n \n(ii)  Review and analyze the entire process of transporting and processing cargoes \nfrom an originating point to a final destination point. The analysis will include a \nrough estimation of processing times/days and costs of processing at each stage \nof the activities. This will be done through discussion with transport operators, \nfreight forwarders, and/or other intermediaries and also through review of existing \nstudies and papers. \n \n(iii)  Benchmark the current performance of individual subregional corridors against \nregional best practices. \n \n(iv)  Based on the analysis, identify major choke points and institutional/operational \nimpediments.  \n \n14.  Part 3: Choke point analysis. Congestion often takes place at gateway points, both \nland-based  and  sea-based.  Solution  of  this  problem  requires  cooperation  between  both \ncountries concerned. Analyses will be carried out from a traffic engineering viewpoint, and also \nin terms of adequacy of cargo-handling facilities and effectiveness of the operational procedures \nof cargo-handling and inspection facilities. Cargo movements and channeling facilities will be \nexamined from both sides of the border to ensure smooth cross-border movements of cargo. \nChoke points to be analyzed will be selected based on the recommendation by the  operational \nefficiency  evaluation  study  (possible  choke  points  would  include,  for  instance, \nBenapole/Petrapole  gateways,  Birgunj/Raxaul  gateways,  Kharkabhitta-Phulvari/Banglabandh \nland bridge, Kolkata/Haldia Port, and Chittagong Port).   \n ", "4  \n15.  Part  4:    Institutional  and  operational  impediment  analysis.  Institutional  and \noperational impediments are the major causes of the poor performance of the existing corridors. \nAnalysis will be carried out with regard to whether these impediments can be removed by \nstricter enforcement of existing bilateral transit arrangements. Similar analysis will be carried out \nwith regard to whether advanced IT or operation/management systems (which are widely used \nin  the  world)  can  bring  about  significant  improvement  of  performance.  Those  IT  or \noperation/management  systems  to  be  examined  include  EDI,  the  TIR  carnet  system, \nstandardized  shipment  documents,  and  other  appropriate  technologies  and  systems.  The \napplicability of these technologies and systems will be determined out on both a system-wide \nbasis and corridor-by-corridor basis.   \n \n16.  Part 5: Development of project/program concepts. Based on the above analyses, the \nconsultants  will  develop  concepts  for  specific  projects  or  programs  to  be  financed  by \nmultilateral/bilateral aid agencies or by the governments in the subregion. The consultants will \nalso identify investment opportunities by the private sector. The projects/ programs to be \ndeveloped will not necessarily need to entail the participation of more than one country. Those \nthat are implemented by one country within its territory but with significant implication for \nsubregional cooperation may be included in the recommended projects or programs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n17.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $250,000 equivalent, which includes foreign \nexchange costs of $189,600 and local currency costs of  $60,400 equivalent. The RETA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are shown in Appendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The Executing Agency of the RETA will be ADB. The Nepalese Government will be the \nhost country for the phase II activities of TWG.  \n \n19.  To carry out the RETA, ADB will engage an international consulting firm, using ADB\u2019s \nquality and cost-based selection procedures and in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of \ndomestic consultants (a simplified technical proposal method will be used). The task requires 6 \nperson-months of input of two international consultants (one logistic specialist and one trade \nfacilitation specialist), and 6 person-months of input of two domestic consultants (two logistics \nspecialists familiar with the local situation).  \n \n20.  During the phase II activities, the TWG and Trade and Private Sector Working Group will \ncoordinate with each other in their activities to generate synergy between their activities. \n \n21.  The  consultants  should  communicate  with  those  to  be  engaged  for  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance for Market Access and Productivity Growth of the Private \nSector in Nepal through exchange of information and data. \n \n22.  The RETA will commence in September 2003 and be completed in March 2004. Terms \nof reference for the consulting services are outlined in Appendix 3.  As a part of the assignment, \nthe consultants will organize a small working group meeting to be held in a third country outside \nof the SASEC subregion. The consultants will prepare a report summarizing the findings of the \nfield visit and analyses. The report will be reviewed by the TWG.  ", "  5\n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Subregional Corridor Operational Efficiency Study in the South Asia Subregion, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  for  the  Subregional  Corridor  Operational \nEfficiency Study in the South Asia Subregion will be carried out by a team of consultants \nconsisting of an international logistics specialist, an international trade facilitation specialist, and \ntwo domestic logistics specialists. The international logistics specialist should have extensive \nknowledge of and experience in: (i) transport logistics process, particularly the whole chain of \ninland distribution of containers and externally traded goods; (ii) logistics-related industries such \nas freight forwarding, warehousing, trucking, container freight stations, shipping agencies, and \ncustoms brokerage; (iii) supply chain analysis, or logistics cost calculation; and (iv) economic \nevaluation of projects. The specialist, who will provide 4 person-months of services, should also \nbe familiar with the operations of multilateral aid agencies such as the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the World Bank.  \n \n2.   The international trade facilitation specialist should also have extensive knowledge of \nand  experience  in  customs  clearance,  other  cross-border  formalities,  shipment-related \ndocumentation  such  as  bills  of  lading  and  way  bills;  nomenclature  of  externally  traded \ncommodities;  handover  procedures  for  containers  between  different  parties;  Transport \nInternational Routier (TIR) carnet; electronic data interchanges (EDI); and other procedural, \ndocumentation, and information technology (IT) requirements. S/he will provide 2 person-month \nof services.    \n \n3.  The two domestic logistics specialists should be familiar with (i) transport logistics \nprocess;  (ii)  logistics-related  industries  such  as  freight  forwarding,  warehousing, trucking, \ncontainer freight stations, shipping agencies, and customs brokerage for each of the four \ncountries participating in the South Asia Economic Cooperation (SASEC), each covering two \ncountries. The total input of the services by these domestic consultants will be 6 person-months.  \n \nB.  Tasks \n \n4.  The experts will carry out the following tasks: \n \n1.  Development  of  a  possible  list  of  subregional  corridors  to  be  studied \n  under the phase II activities \n \n5.  The international logistics specialist will prepare a list of possible subregional corridors \nbased on the results of the findings of the phase I activities and other studies. Possible selection \ncriteria include (i) corridors that have served the subregion as major physical links, (ii) those that \nwould offer alternatives to major subregional physical links with significant cost/time savings; \nand (iii) those that would improve the transport/transit system in the areas at crossroads such as \nWest  Bengal  and  Assam.  An  important  element  of  the  corridor  selection  is  that  these \nsubregional  corridors  have  already  been  included  in  bilateral  transit  and/or  transport \nagreements or in the other similar agreements such as operational agreements between two \nrailways.  \n \n6.  The international logistics specialist will develop a list of possible subregional corridors to \nbe included in the SASEC framework. From this list, the consultant will select those corridors to \nbe examined in the phase II study. The total number of corridors to be studied will not exceed \nsix in consideration of the limited availability of time and resources. ", "  Appendix 3   9 \n2.  Organization of a workshop for the selection of the subregional corridors \nand discussion of the survey process  \n \n7.  The international logistics specialist will prepare an inception report setting out the \nplanned methodology of the RETA and an implementation schedule. The inception report \nshould include the lists of (i) subregional corridors to be included in the SASEC framework, and \n(ii) those to be examined in the RETA.  \n \n8.  To finalize these lists, the international logistics specialist will organize a workshop for \nsecuring the endorsement of members of the Transport Working Group (TWG). The workshop \nwill be composed of one representative from each member country, the consultants, and ADB \nstaff. It will be held in an appropriate location outside of the four SASEC countries. The \ninternational logistics specialist will  also seek cooperation from the participating countries on  \nfield visits to be conducted subsequently. At the end of the workshop, the international logistics \nspecialist will prepare a short note summarizing key agreements reached for endorsement by \nthe participants.   \n \n3.  Evaluation of operational efficiency of individual subregional corridors   \n \n9.  The  international  logistics  specialist  will  assess  the  operational  efficiency  of  each \nsubregional corridor in the following manner: \n \n(i)  Review  and  describe  current  bilateral/trilateral/other  transit  arrangements  for \neach subregional corridor. \n \n(ii)  Review and analyze the entire process of transporting and processing cargoes \nfrom an originating point to a final destination along the subregional corridor. The \nanalysis  will  include  an  estimate  of  processing  times/days  and  costs  of \nprocessing at each stage of the activities. The process includes a whole chain of \nactivities including (i) loading and unloading operations onto or from trucks/rail \nwagons; (ii) line-haul services by truck or rail; (iii) cargo handling at inland \ncontainer depots or container freight stations; (iv) warehousing and other value- \nadded activities such as labeling and packaging; (v) customs inspections and \nother cross-border inspections; and (vi) cargo/container handling operations at \nports,  but  not  including  sailing  by  oceangoing  vessels.  The  costs  include  (i) \nfreight to be paid to trucks/rail/inland water transport operators; (ii) fees to be \npaid to freight forwarders and other intermediaries; (iii) fees to be paid to customs \nbrokers,  but  not  including  import/export  duties;  (iv)  insurance  fees;  and \nimportantly (v) informal payments in a variety of forms to be paid to authorities to \nexpedite the process. This will be done through interviewing transport operators, \nfreight forwarders, and/or other intermediaries and also through review of existing \nstudies and papers. \n \n(iii)  Evaluate the possible extent of improvement by introducing subregional best \npractices (e.g., those crossing the Bhutan/India border, or container handling at \nJNPT).   \n \n(iv)  Based on the analysis, identify major choke points and institutional/operational \nimpediments. \n \n \n ", "10  Appendix  3 \n4.  Choke point analysis \n \n10.  Analyses of congestion at gateway points, both land-based and sea-based, will be \ncarried out from a traffic engineering viewpoint, and also in terms of adequacy of cargo-handling \nfacilities and effectiveness of the operational procedures of cargo-handling  and  inspection \nfacilities. Cargo movements and channeling facilities will be examined from both sides of the \nborder to ensure smooth cross border movements of cargo. In the case of seaports, analysis \nwill encompass not only intraport facilities but also those located in their immediate vicinities.  \nChoke points to be analyzed will be selected based on the recommendation by the operational \nefficiency  evaluation  study  (possible  choke  points  would  include,  for  instance, \nBenapole/Petrapole  gateways,  Birgunj/Raxaul  gateways  (particularly  road-based  gateway \npoints  rather  than  rail-based  points),  Kharkabhitta-Phulvari/Banglabandh  land  bridge, \nKolcatta/Haldia Port, and Chittagong Port. The international logistics specialist should develop \nan overall plan for improving the flow of cargo between two sides of the border for each choke \npoint. This would require estimating the current traffic volume passing through border points, \nanalysis of the current flow of traffic, assessment of cargo-handling capacity of the existing \nfacilities for transshipment, identification of better channeling mechanisms, and development of \nnew traffic schemes together with new investment needs.   \n \n5.  Institutional and operational impediment analysis \n \n11.  The  international  logistics  specialist  will  carry  out  an  analysis  of  institutional  and \noperational impediments in existing corridors with regard to whether these impediments can be \nremoved by stricter enforcement of existing bilateral transit arrangements. The international \ntrade facilitation  specialist will carry out an analysis with regard to whether advanced IT or \noperation/management systems (which are widely used in the world) can bring about significant \nimprovement of performance. Those IT or operation/management systems to be examined \ninclude EDI, TIR carnet system, standardized shipment documents, and other appropriate \ntechnologies  and  systems.  The  applicability  of  these  technologies  and  systems  will  be \ndetermined on both a system-wide basis and corridor-by-corridor basis. The international trade \nfacilitation  specialist  will  assess  the  adequacy  of  existing  infrastructure  (such  as  the \ntelecommunications network) for smooth functioning of these technologies and systems. His/her \nrecommendation should include both (i) those technologies and systems that can be introduced \nwithout  upgrading  the  current  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  those  only  possible  with  upgraded \ninfrastructure being put in place.  \n \n  6.  Development of project/program concepts \n \n12.  Based on the above analyses, the international logistics and trade facilitation specialists \nwill develop concepts for specific projects or programs to be financed by multilateral/bilateral aid \nagencies or by the governments in the subregion. The projects/programs to be developed will \nnot necessarily need  to entail the participation of more than one country. Those that are \nimplemented by one country within its territory but with significant implication for subregional \ncooperation may be included in the recommended projects or programs.  Possible types of the \nprojects or programs include  \n \n(i)  an investment project for infrastructure such as road, rail, inland waterway, or  \nport;  \n ", "  Appendix 3   11 \n(ii)  a  multicomponent  project  for  micro  infrastructure  facilities  such  as  inland \ncontainer  depots,  transshipment  facilities,  improvement  of  telecommunication \nsystems, computer systems upgrade, weighing stations or EDI; and \n \n(iii)  a capacity-building technical assistance for (i) training the staff for computer \nsystems  such  as  advanced  system  for  customs  declaration  and  approval,  \nadvanced cargo information system, and/or container inventory management \nsystem; (ii) provision of training for customs officers and other officials for cross-\nborder  inspections;  (iii)  introduction  of  accreditation  systems  for  logistics \nspecialists through distant learning; and/or (iv) standardization of documentation \nsuch  as  bills  of  lading,  simplification  of  cross-border  inspections,  and/or \nintroduction of TIR carnets for facilitation of cross-border truck movement.  \n \n7.
