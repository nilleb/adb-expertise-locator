INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Weaknesses in the regulatory and supervisory oversight framework for the Indonesian \nfinancial sector contributed to many of the problems in the financial sector that became evident \nin the crisis of the late 1990s that saw the virtual collapse of the financial system. In response to \nthe crisis, the Government took steps to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory regime for \nthe financial sector in conjunction with other measures to (i) restore public confidence by \nproviding  guarantees  for  bank  depositors,  (ii)  close  nonviable  financial  institutions,  (iii) \nimplement rehabilitation and recapitalization programs for banks, and (iv) support the resolution \nof impaired assets. A new central bank law in 1999 provided for the future transfer of banking \nsupervision functions from the central bank (Bank Indonesia [BI]) to a single supervisory body \nfor banks and nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), named the Financial Services Authority \n(FSA).1 In response to a request from the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nprovided  technical  assistance  (TA)2  for  planning  for  FSA.  Implementation  of  that  TA \ncommenced in July 2001. It has made major progress in supporting the preparation of the \ndetailed design of FSA, drafting relevant legislation, and mapping the future establishment of \nFSA. It is due for completion in June 2002, by which time the FSA bill is expected to be \nsubmitted to Parliament.      \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s timetable for the establishment of FSA foresees enactment of the \nFSA law by the end of 2002. This will be followed by a one-year period of preparation and \ninstitution building, with FSA formally commencing operations at the start of 2004. To enable \nongoing support throughout this time, the Government has requested ADB to provide additional \nTA.3  ADB fielded a Fact-Finding Mission in January 2002 that reached an understanding with \nthe Government on the objectives and scope of the proposed TA, its cost estimates, and \nimplementation arrangements. The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1. Progress towards \nthe establishment of FSA is one of the key issues to be addressed in the Government\u2019s \nFinancial Governance and Social Security Reform Program, which will be supported by a \nplanned ADB program loan in 2002. This program aims to support a broad framework for the \noverall strengthening of the financial sector and will promote the development of sound financial \ninstitutions necessary for good governance and growth.  Key policy actions to be carried out in \n2002  for  the  program  have  been  agreed  to,  and  the  Government  is  making  progress  in \naccordance with an action plan agreed upon with ADB.  \n \nII.  ISSUES OR PROBLEMS \n \n3.  In Indonesia, banks have been regulated and supervised by BI; the securities market by \nthe Capital Market Supervisory Agency (BAPEPAM), which reports to the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF); and insurance companies, pension funds, finance companies and venture capital funds \nby  the  Directorate  General  of  Financial  Institutions  (DGFI)  in  MOF.  Notwithstanding \nimprovements  achieved  under  the  Financial  Governance  Reforms  Sector  Development \nProgram  (FGRSDP),4  BI  and  BAPEPAM  require  further  enhancement  of  their  governance \nstandards, and DGFI has neither the resources nor the skills to adequately regulate and \nsupervise the financial institutions under its responsibility. The multiple agency structure has \nfragmented regulatory and supervisory oversight and has not been conducive to effective \n                                                 \n1  Previously referred to as the Financial Services Supervisory Institution. \n2  TA 3620-INO: Development of a Financial Services Supervisory Institution, for $1.7 million, approved on 7 January \n2001.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) in December 2001. \n4\n  Supported by ADB Loan 1618-INO: Financial Governance Reforms Sector Development Program, for $1.4 billion, \napproved on 25 June 1998.  ", "2  \nsupervision  of  the  conglomerates  that  have  emerged  in  Indonesia.  Weaknesses  in  the \nperformance  of  individual  agencies  have  been  compounded  by  limited  coordination  and \ninformation sharing among agencies, thereby making it difficult to assess the consolidated risk \nexposure of intermediaries. These weaknesses enabled poorly managed financial institutions to \ntake excessive risks, which contributed to liquidity problems in the crisis. \n \n4.  Although regulators and supervisors were aware of these flawed market practices, their \nability to take appropriate action was limited because of political interference, weak incentive \nstructures, poor accountability, and lack of staff skills. Post-crisis financial reviews and audits of \ncommercial  banks  revealed  weaknesses  in  balance  sheets  and  lack  of  compliance  with \nregulations, although BI and auditors had earlier rated these institutions as sound. BAPEPAM \nlacks the autonomy, resources, and capacity to effectively enforce laws and regulations or to \nconduct inspections and investigations of brokerage and securities firms. Although MOF has \nresponsibility for the regulation and supervision of NBFIs, it has been unable to effectively \nperform this role. \n \n5.  Recognizing these weaknesses in financial sector oversight, the Government enacted \nthe new central bank law, which requires the future transfer of banking supervision to a new \nindependent FSA to supervise banks and NBFIs. As a preparatory step to establishing FSA, BI, \nwith assistance from the International Monetary Fund, is implementing the Master Plan for \nStrengthening Banking Supervision System for 2000-2002 and an action plan for banks to \ncomply  with  international  regulatory  standards.  BI  is  strengthening  its  capabilities  in \n(i) commercial  bank  surveillance,  (ii) problem  bank  management,  (iii) offsite  and  onsite \nsupervision,  and  (iv) research  and  training.  Simultaneously,  under  the  ADB-supported \nFGRSDP,  BAPEPAM  and  DGFI  (i)  have  introduced  risk-based  capital  requirements  for \nsecurities and insurance companies; (ii) are developing management information systems; \n(iii) have started to strengthen enforcement, inspection, and investigation of market participants; \nand  (iv) have  launched  staff  training  in  these  areas.  These  initiatives  will  help  prepare \nBAPEPAM and DGFI for the future consolidation of regulation and supervision functions in \nFSA.  \n \n6.  Indonesia is not unique in having relied on separate agencies to handle the regulation \nand supervision of different types of financial institutions. The United States continues with \nmultiple regulators,5 although with enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, functional \nregulation  has  been  adopted  to  enhance  competition  in  financial  services  and  has  been \nextended to the financial conglomerates permitted by the Act. The system recognizes that \nregulatory  specialization  enhances  risk  management  and  supervision  of  diverse  financial \nservice  organizations  comprising  commercial  banks,  securities  broker-dealers,  insurance \ncompanies, and other NBFIs. The continued existence of separate regulators reflects the vast \nsize  of  the  financial  sector,  the  effectiveness  of  regulators,  their  success  in  interagency \ncoordination, and the constitutional constraint of state jurisdiction over the insurance sector. \n \n7.  Operating with separate regulators in other countries is, however, increasingly difficult, \nas the financial sector becomes more complex. Potential inconsistencies in the application of \nregulatory  approaches  carry  the  risk  of  regulatory  arbitrage,  with  profit-driven  financial \ninstitutions  seeking  to  exploit  regulatory  differences  among  regulators  of  similar  financial \nproducts. The move toward consolidated regulatory structures has recently gained momentum \n                                                 \n5  These include (i) the three agencies dealing with the banking sector\u2014the Federal Reserve Board, Office of the \nComptroller  of  the  Currency,  and  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation;  (ii)  the  Securities  Exchange \nCommission, which deals with securities markets regulation and supervision; and (iii) the state governments, which \ndeal with insurance regulation and supervision. \n ", "3  \ndue  to  the  lifting  of  restrictions  on  capital  movements; the need for effective regulation of \nfinancial  conglomerates  with  international  operations;  and  the  blurring  of  geographical, \nfunctional, and institutional boundaries. In the late 1990s the United Kingdom opted to establish \nits Financial Services Authority as a single regulator to exercise prudential regulation and \nsupervision of businesses and markets, provide consumer protection, and control financial \ncrime. Japan and the Republic of Korea followed a similar approach. Australia adopted a more \nfunctional approach, and assigned the prudential regulatory responsibility for banks, insurance \ncompanies,  and  pension  funds  to  the  Australian  Prudential  Regulation  Authority,  and  the \noversight of securities firms and market and business conduct to the Australian Securities \nInvestments Commission. The Reserve Bank of Australia continues to handle monetary policy \nand stability of the payment system, and two other agencies address market competition and \nconsumer protection. Canada merged banking and insurance regulation and supervision in \n1987, but retains separate securities commissions at the provincial level to oversee capital \nmarkets. Some Scandinavian countries moved in the mid-1980s to consolidate the regulation \nand supervision of banks, and insurance and securities markets, while Singapore and several \nother small countries rely on central banks to oversee the entire financial sector. Drawing on \nthis  international  experience,  the  International  Committee  for  Banking  Supervisors  in \nSeptember 2000 concluded that, given the diversity and variations in regulatory structures, it is \nnot possible to prescribe a model framework for all. Each country must evolve its oversight \nstructure for the financial sector based on its market structures and practices.  \n \n8.  Since  commencement,  TA  3620-INO  (footnote  2)  has  supported  the  FSA  steering \ncommittee,6 which provides overall direction and decides on policy issues in FSA design; an \nFSA executive committee of senior officials; and an interministerial working party. The case for \nregulatory amalgamation in Indonesia has been further endorsed during TA implementation as \nfollows: (i) it will better align the regulatory structure with the emerging conglomerate structure \nof the Indonesian finance sector, thereby enabling greater coherence in financial regulation and \nsupervision; (ii) it will allow consistent application of regulatory powers across the financial \nsector; (iii) it will allow the more efficient use of scarce regulatory resources; and (iv) the \nestablishment of a new agency with appropriate autonomy, accountability, and governance \nstructures provides the opportunity to address the weaknesses that constrain progress toward \nmore effective operation of existing agencies. However, regulatory amalgamation alone cannot \nguarantee  an  effective  outcome.  While  it  will  provide  a  valuable  foundation,  it  is  critically \nimportant to ensure that restructuring is accompanied by fundamental improvements in the \neffectiveness of financial regulation. Accordingly, the central focus of the FSA design is to \nmaximize regulatory effectiveness. FSA must establish a new regulatory culture, as far as \npossible removed from the legacies of the past. This new culture will focus on the achievement \nof effective regulation and the recognition and reward of ability and commitment among FSA \nmanagement and staff.  \n \n9.  A number of other key design issues have been addressed by the steering committee \nsince commencement of the TA. While the 1999 BI law specified the transfer of only banking \nsupervision functions from BI to FSA, it has now been determined that both supervision and \nregulation of banks will be transferred to FSA. The delineation of responsibilities and functions \nbetween BI and FSA has been further clarified, with BI to retain powers relating to monetary \npolicy and operation of the payment system. The need for close coordination between these \ninstitutions will be reflected in the appointment of the BI governor to the FSA board. A further \ndesign issue, not explicitly covered in the 1999 BI law, has been addressed by the decision of \n                                                 \n6\n Comprising the coordinating minister of economy, minister of finance, governor of BI, minister of justice, and \ncabinet secretary.  \n ", "4  \nthe steering committee to transfer BAPEPAM\u2019s  functions of regulation of markets and market \nconduct to FSA. \n  \n10.  On  the  basis  of  policy  decisions  and  directions  of  the  steering  committee  and  an \nintensive review of existing laws and regulations for the financial sector, TA 3620-INO has \nsupported the Government\u2019s preparation of a draft FSA law and necessary consequential \namendments relating to FSA operations in other financial sector legislation (including the BI, \nbanking,  insurance,  pension,  and  capital  markets  laws).  The  draft  FSA  law  is  based  on \ninternational best practice and effectively addresses the independence, accountability, and \neffective governance of FSA. In particular, there are suitable means for FSA to levy supervised \ninstitutions  and  adequately  meet  its  funding  requirements.  Following  intensive  discussions \nwithin the Government, the FSA plans and draft law have been endorsed by the ministerial \nsteering committee and have been presented to the broader financial community at the FSA \nGrand Seminar held on 27 February 2002. With the strong support demonstrated by ministers, \nsubmission of the FSA law and related consequential amendments to parliament is anticipated \nby mid-2002, with enactment expected by the end of 2002. This will be followed by a 12-month \ntransition period during which existing agencies will continue to operate, but FSA will be legally \nestablished and will undertake staff recruitment and institution building preparatory to assuming \nfull operational powers and responsibilities in early 2004. A key issue during the transition \nperiod will be recruitment of suitable management and staff for FSA while maintaining the \noperational effectiveness and staff morale in the existing agencies. To address this issue, an \ninteragency transition team is planned by the Government, and significant support under the \nproposed TA is directed to FSA human resources and staffing issues. \n \n11.  Completion of the ongoing TA is anticipated in mid-2002 with submission of the FSA \nlaws to parliament. By that time, FSA\u2019s rules and regulations, business plan, and staffing plan \nwill also have been formulated under the ongoing TA. These outputs are expected to meet the \nrequirements  of  the  ongoing  TA.  However,  there  will  remain  a  critical  need  for  seamless \nconsulting input to the Government under the proposed TA to ensure necessary technical \nsupport during parliamentary consideration of the laws; to finalize with the FSA board and \nmanagement  the  details  and  implementation  of  staffing,  organization,  and  information \ntechnology plans; and to generally support the orderly transition from a multi-agency to a single \nagency model for financial sector regulation and supervision.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The purpose of the proposed TA is to support the establishment of FSA as an effective \nregulatory and supervisory agency for the financial sector. The ongoing TA has developed the \ndraft FSA law and associated consequential amendments to other financial sector laws. It has \nalso covered the major design issues of FSA and its transition arrangements.   The proposed \nTA will help operationalize and institutionalize the new framework.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  Under the guidance of the steering committee (footnote 6) and the executive group,7 the \nproposed TA will assist the interagency transition team established by the Government to \n                                                 \n7  Comprising the director general of financial institutions from MOF as chairperson; head of BAPEPAM as vice \nchairperson; and representatives from BI, the Ministry of Justice, and other relevant agencies.  \n ", "5  \noversee the transition from the existing multi- agency  regulatory  structure  to  the  single \nintegrated agency structure. In particular, the TA will (i) provide technical support and facilitate \ndiscussions on the law among industry professionals, members of parliament, ministers, and \ngovernment officials; (ii) support further development and implementation of the organizational \ndesign, human resources plan, and staff training plan for FSA; (iii) assist in drafting new \nregulations and necessary revisions of regulations from existing agencies to meet the needs of \nFSA; (iv) support implementation of the information technology plan; (v) support staff training;  \nand  (vi) coordinate and  support  ongoing  legislative  reform  in existing regulatory agencies to \nensure that any further changes in financial sector laws are consistent with the FSA legal \nframework. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n  \n14.  The proposed TA is estimated to cost $1,930,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange  cost  of  $1,195,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $735,000  equivalent.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $305,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost, for a total of $1,500,000, on a grant basis from the Asian \nCurrency Crisis Support Facility funded by the Government of Japan, or from other TA sources \navailable to ADB. The equipment financed by the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on Procurement and other arrangements acceptable to ADB, and will be transferred \nto FSA upon TA completion. The Government will provide the remaining $430,000 equivalent in \nkind for counterpart staff, office accommodation, training, and office support facilities. Detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  As the executing agency for the proposed TA, DGFI will coordinate the work of the \nconsultants and their interaction with the steering committee, the executive group, and the FSA \nimplementation team appointed by the Government. It is estimated that about 26 person-\nmonths of international and 24 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. \nThe international consultants will include experts in (i) financial regulation, (ii) bank supervision, \n(iii) capital markets, (iv) pension and insurance, (v) law, (vi) information technology, and (vii) \nhuman resources, and the domestic consultants will have expertise in the same areas. A firm \nwill be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements on the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are provided in Appendix 3. The consultants will prepare an inception report within \ntwo months of TA commencement. The report will be discussed and agreed upon at a tripartite \nmeeting of the consultants, the Government, and ADB. A midterm review will be conducted to \ndiscuss the findings and progress of the TA. The consultants will submit a draft final report for \nreview  at  a  tripartite  meeting  and  will  incorporate  comments  in  the  final  TA  report  for \nendorsement by the steering committee. The TA will commence by July 2002 and end by \nMarch 2004.  \n \nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n16.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical \nassistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Indonesia in an amount not exceeding the \nequivalent of $1,500,000 for the purpose of the Establishment of a Financial Services Authority. \n ", "  6 \nAppendix 1, page 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms  Risks/Assumptions \nTargets \nGoal       \nConsolidation and  Efficient and  The Government has set  Political support for passage \nstrengthening of  effective  up a ministerial steering  of proposed FSA law \nregulatory and  enforcement of  committee and executive  including provisions for its \nsupervisory framework  regulation and  group of senior officials to  necessary independence to \nto provide effective  supervision  oversee and coordinate  operate in accordance with \nand efficient oversight  the planning and  the law    \nfor the financial sector  implementation of the   \nFinancial Services   \nAuthority (FSA).

General \n1.  The  consultants  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  Financial  Services  Authority \n(FSA) as an effective oversight regulatory and supervisory agency for the financial sector. A \nprevious  Asian  Development  Bank  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  (Stage  I)  has  been \nsupporting the drafting of a proposed FSA law, together with a consequential amendments law \nthat makes all existing finance sector laws consistent with the proposed FSA law. Major FSA \ndesign issues and transition arrangements were also addressed in Stage I. Under the proposed \nTA, consultants will help operationalize the new framework. The consultants will be guided by \nthe output of Stage I, and will work closely with the FSA steering committee, executive group, \nand implementation team established by the Government to oversee the transition from the \nexisting multi-agency structure to the single integrated structure set up by FSA. The consultants\u2019 \nrole will include the following: \n    \n(i)  Provide  support  and  facilitate  discussions  on  the  law  among  industry \nprofessionals, members of parliament, ministers, and government officials during \nthe legislative process. \n \n(ii)  Develop further details of the organization plan and human resources plan for \nFSA initiated in Stage 1. This will include extending job descriptions to junior \nlevels, assessing and finalizing appointment criteria and accreditation options for \nstaff to be recruited by FSA, filling out details of the remuneration policy, and \nassessing transfer costs associated with staff moving from existing regulatory \nagencies. \n \n(iii)  Assist where needed with assessing appointments to the new FSA. \n \n(iv)  Assist in developing and drafting new and revised regulations to meet the needs \nof FSA. In some cases, existing regulations will be transferable in content and \nwill require minimal changes to fit the FSA framework. Other regulations will \nrequire significant rewriting, both to fit the new framework and to update the \ncontent  to  be  consistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  FSA.  In  several  areas, \ncompletely new regulations will be required to establish regulatory oversight and \nconsistency where these have been absent in the current framework. \n \n(v)  Assist in developing procedures to ensure effective delineation of the operational \nroles of FSA and Bank Indonesia (BI). This will aim to avoid unnecessary overlap \nof functions, and will identify areas and develop procedures for coordination and \ninformation sharing between FSA and BI consistent with their respective laws.  \n \n \n \n \n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 15)\n \n \n \n \n ", "                                                                    10                                             A ppendix  3, pag e    2              \n   \n(vi)  Support implementation of the information technology (IT) plan developed in \nStage 1.
