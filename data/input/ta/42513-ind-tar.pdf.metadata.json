", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  India  has  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for capacity development to support the proposed Karnataka State \nHighway Network Development Strategy. The Fact-Finding Mission visited the state from 17 to \n21  November  2008  and  met  with  senior  officials  of  the  government  of  Karnataka  (GOK), \nKarnataka Public Works Department (KPWD), the project implementation unit of the Karnataka \nState  Highways  Improvement  Project  (KSHIP),  Karnataka  Road  Development  Corporation \nLimited  (KRDCL),  and  subsequently  with  officials  of  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs, \nMinistry of Finance, Government of India. The fact-finding mission was supplemented by a \nconsultation mission on 25 March 2009 which met with GOK and KSHIP officials. This capacity \ndevelopment  TA  was  developed  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  concurrence  with  its  impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The road network in Karnataka totals 209,905 kilometers (km) and comprises 3,978 km \nof national highways, 20,738 km of state highways, 37,943 km of major district roads, and \n147,212 km of village roads. The length of the state highway network has recently increased. \nThe total length of primary roads (i.e., state highways and major district roads) in the state is \n62,659 km. GOK has formulated the concept of a core road network (CRN) that encompasses \nthe road links considered important for the economic and social development of the state. The \nlong-term goal is for the CRN to cover the most vital 20% of the entire road network, or \napproximately 40,000 km. The medium-term term goal is a CRN of 25,000 km comprising both \nnational and state highway roads.  \n \n3.  The CRN was determined based on existing data and without analyzing the future traffic \nand socioeconomic needs of the state. Hence there is a need for master planning to draw up a \nfuture CRN for the state. The process must assess the current and future socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the state for agriculture, mining, industry, and tourism, and how best to provide \nconnectivity to other transport modes (rail, air, and inland waterway terminals and ports), to \nidentify the required corridors for road infrastructure and estimate the likely traffic demand on \neach corridor for the next 10 years. This will help ensure that the CRN identified after this \nanalysis will serve the needs of the state for the next 10 years, not just its current needs. The \nprocess  must  also  formulate  standards  for  traffic  signs  and  other  road  fixtures,  roadside \namenities, enforcement needs, etc.   \n \n4.  Several  GOK  agencies  are  involved  in  the  road  sector.  KPWD  is  a  government \ndepartment and has historically been responsible for developing and maintaining the entire \nnetwork of state highways and major district roads in the state using funds from the state \ngovernment budget. However, in 1999, GOK set up KRDCL to undertake the construction and \nmaintenance of the state highway network. KPWD then became responsible for maintaining the \nmajor district road network using only GOK allocations. In October 2008, GOK decided that \nmaintaining the state highway network (with the exception of newly constructed roads) would \nonce again become the responsibility of KPWD. The original objective was for KRDCL to \nmobilize non-GOK financing for maintaining the state highway network. However, after taking \none loan, KRDCL perceived the financing costs of outside borrowing to be high and has not \ntaken out any other loan. The funding source for KRDCL now is exactly the same as for KPWD \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 December 2008.  \n ", "2   \ni.e. GOK allocations. The Infrastructure Development Department is a department of GOK \nestablished  to  play  a  significant  role  in  promoting  increased  private  investment  in  public \ninfrastructure. In the road sector, it has identified four state highway projects with a total length \nof 2,000 km for upgrading under annuity and/or design\u2013build\u2013operate\u2013transfer schemes. It is \nalso considering upgrading other roads with private sector participation. The Karnataka State \nHighways, Traffic, and Transport Authority (KSHTTA) was set up in 2001 as the Karnataka \nState Highways Authority to fulfill a World Bank loan processing requirement that the GOK \nestablish a State Highways Authority. KSHTTA is an advisory body consisting of 11 GOK \nofficials and five nongovernment members. It has no permanent staff assigned to it. \n \n5.  KPWD established in 2001 a project implementation unit to undertake the KSHIP. It is \nresponsible for implementing all externally aided state highway projects in Karnataka. It is \nheaded by a project director who reports administratively to the principal secretary of KPWD \nthrough the secretary of KPWD. However, for the purpose of implementing the KSHIP, the \nproject director reports to the chief project officer. Under KSHIP, 2,413 km of roads across 19 \ndistricts of the state were improved, 901 km of which were upgraded and 1,512 km of which \nwere rehabilitated. GOK is currently discussing with the World Bank a second KSHIP loan \n(KSHIP II) to upgrade another 559 km of state highways. An institutional strengthening action \nplan was implemented under the first KSHIP loan (KSHIP I). A follow-on institutional action plan \nis under discussion between GOK and the World Bank for implementation under KSHIP II.  \n \n6.  KPWD  is  the  single  largest  road  sector  agency  in  the  state,  with  responsibility  for \nbuildings as well as roads. Its responsibilities in the road sector will further increase with the \nGOK decision of October 2008 to entrust again the maintenance of most of the state highway \nnetwork  to  KPWD.  However  the  organizational  structure  of  KPWD  does  not  provide  an \ninstitutional functional focus on the road sector. It would be better if, at the zonal level, there \nwere a clear-cut division of responsibilities, with some circles and divisions being responsible for \nKPWD\u2019s road sector responsibilities and other circles and divisions responsible for its other \nresponsibilities. This could be done if a zonal superintending engineer under the chief engineer \ncould  be  tasked  to  look  exclusively  after  roads.  The  circles  and  divisions  could  then  be \nreorganized such that there are circles and zones dedicated exclusively to the road sector while \nothers  are  dedicated  exclusively  to  other  KPWD  functions  (e.g.,  buildings).  Such \nrearrangements  of  the  institutional  structure  could  be  carried  out  within  KPWD\u2019s  existing \npersonnel ceiling. \n \n7.  As GOK is likely to implement a toll policy soon, the need exists to build capacity in it to \nprepare a tolling strategy and undertake a campaign to provide correct and timely information to \nthe public to build support for it. Furthermore, although transaction advisors have been provided \nby ADB to the Infrastructure Development Department2 and will also be provided by the World \nBank under the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, once the contracts are signed, \nthey will have to be administered by the road agencies themselves. Hence there is a need to \nprovide training at suitable institutions and agencies in India that have the experience and \ncapability to train GOK officials to negotiate contracts and administer private sector participation \n(PSP) projects using actual case studies. \n \n8.  It  is  clear  that  there  are  many  agencies  are  involved  in  the  road  sector.  As  road \ninfrastructure is a networked system, the optimum benefits from any investment in the road \nsector can best be obtained by considering network impacts and effects. This means that sector \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for Mainstreaming Public\u2013Private Partnerships at State Level. Manila \n(TA 4890-IND). ", "  3\nplanning, project planning, and policy formulation for the road sector have to be done in an \nintegrated and consolidated manner by one agency. The execution of components or elements \nof the approved plan can be carried out by individual agencies, as is done under current \npractice. The GOK approved a road sector policy and identified KSHTTA as the nodal agency \nfor planning and policy formulation in the roads sector3. However, for KSHTTA to play this role, \nit has to be converted from an advisory body into an executive body with planning powers and a \nrole in budget allocation. This will require KSHTTA to have staff assigned to it. GOK and ADB \nhave analyzed the policy and institutional-strengthening efforts that have been, and will be, \ncarried out under various initiatives, to identify the gaps that need to be addressed to make \nthese efforts more effective. A summary of the policy and institutional gap analysis is shown in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced efficiency in the planning, programming, policy \nformulation, and monitoring of the road sector in Karnataka such that the percentage of links on \nthe CRN where volume exceeds capacity is reduced by 30% in the next 5 years and by 70% in \nthe next 10 years. The outcome of the TA will be that KSHTTA and KPWD effectively implement \ntheir mandated responsibilities to plan, manage, and maintain Karnataka\u2019s state road network. \nIdentifying, planning,  and  financing  a  25,000  km  CRN  is  necessary  to  support  the  state\u2019s \nsocioeconomic development and will be done taking into account the future needs of the state. \nThis TA will serve as the foundation for another follow-on capacity development TA as well as a \nproject preparatory TA to prepare possible projects for ADB financing.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Formulating the Core Road Network. The TA will formulate a CRN for the state for the \nnext 10 years with the development of the road sector master plan. The required corridors and \nstandards for road infrastructure and road amenities will be identified through traffic surveys and \nreviews of existing plans for the current and future socioeconomic development of the state for \nagriculture, mining, industry and tourism, as well as with an eye toward providing connectivity to \nother transport modes (i.e., rail, air, and inland waterway terminals and ports). The likely traffic \ndemand on each corridor for the next 10 years will be estimated using traffic surveys and origin\u2013\ndestination surveys and modeling. This will be done in close consultation with the relevant GOK \nofficials overseeing the TA to ensure that the final output as the ownership of the GOK.  \n \n11.  Institutional Strengthening of KSHTTA. GOK recently approved a state road policy \nthat identifies the new role of KSHTTA as the planning and regulatory body for the roads sector. \nThe TA will carry out capacity development to strengthen KSHTTA so that it can act as the \nnodal agency for planning and programming the road sector. It will carry out an organizational \nanalysis to recommend the organizational structure and skill mix required to fully operationalize \nKSHTTA, as well as to develop and implement databases and systems within KSHTTA to \nenable it to maintain the statistical databases necessary for carrying out maintenance planning \nand programming, project planning. The major outputs of institutional strengthening during the \nTA will be (i) the formulation of the CRN and (ii) the development of management information \nsystems for planning and programming work. As KSHTTA does not now have any staff, GOK \nwill create an \u201cembryo unit\u201d of the future, strengthened KSHTTA in the project implementation \n                                                 \n3  GOK issued an order regarding this approval on 6 March 2009. \n ", "4   \nunit for the KSHIP. This embryo unit will be in place before the TA starts so that consultants will \nhave a core group of people to work with while developing the systems that will be used by \nKSHTTA.  Training  the  staff  assigned  to  KSHTTA  will  be  done  using  a  learning-by-doing \napproach so that KSHTTA can build upon what was done during the TA after it is completed. \nOfficials from the \"embryo unit\" will be fully involved in developing the various plans, including \norganizational  restructuring  proposals,  systems  and  procedures  necessary  for  the  effective \nfunctioning of the KSHTTA.  \n \n12.  Reorganization  of  KPWD.  The  objective  of  this  component  is  to  strengthen  the \ninstitutional focus of KPWD on the roads sector, considering that it will be the agency to carry \nout the maintenance of the state highway network. The TA will study the current organizational \nstructure of KPWD and the sanctioned and current staffing pattern to better assess the staff \nrequirement for road sector activities. It will prepare a draft implementation plan for reorganizing \nKPWD such that the major focus of the KPWD in the future will be on road sector activities. This \nobjective  has  already  been  accepted  by  KPWD  management.  It  will  also  formulate  an \nappropriate training curriculum. After approval by KPWD and ADB, it will be implemented by \nKPWD.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,875,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $1.5 million equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  GOK  will  finance  the  balance  equivalent  to \n$375,000 in kind by providing office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff, maps, \nreports,  and  other  logistical  support.  Appendix  3  shows  details  of  the  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The project implementation unit for the KSHIP of KPWD will be the Executing Agency. \nThe chief project officer of the KSHIP will appoint a project director who will be responsible for \nthe day-to-day supervision of the TA. GOK assured the mission that all required counterpart \nstaff, office space, furniture, equipment, support facilities for surveys, maps, reports, and other \nsupport services will be made available to the consultants in a timely manner. All equipment for \nthe TA (principally office and survey equipment and software) will be procured according to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and turned over to the \nExecuting Agency upon TA completion. \n \n15.  An appropriate international consulting firm that can supply a team with expertise in \ntransport  planning,  and  the  institutional  strengthening  of  transport  sector  agencies  will  be \nrecruited for the TA. National consultants will be engaged by the international consulting firm, \nwhich will be responsible for these TA components. Individual consultants may also be recruited \nunder the TA to advise KSHTTA in its formative stages. It is anticipated that 16 person-months \nof international and 64 person-months of national consulting services will be required.  The \nconsultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.4 The TA will help GOK to develop \nthe capacity to implement its recently approved road sector policy by transforming the way road \nsector  activities  are  carried  out  with  the  separation  of  planning,  programming,  and  policy \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. ", "  5\nformulation from implementation and the development of institutions charged with implementing \nthis new policy. The TA will develop the capacity of an entirely new agency, i.e. the KSHTTA, \nrefocus the orientation of the KPWD to be primarily a road maintenance agency and formulate \nthe plan that will guide the strategic development of the roads sector in the state. These are all \nactivities which will have a high impact for the sector. This is especially because since new \ninstitutions are being set up to carry out a new policy, the assignment is complex and it is critical \nthat all these activities are carried out successfully in the first instance to ensure the credibility of \nthe new policy and new institutions and the major reorientation of focus in existing institutions. \nThe quality of the consultants should be the paramount selection criterion. The consulting firm \nwill therefore be selected according to quality-based selection procedures, and a full technical \nproposal will be requested from shortlisted firms. The outline terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 4. Should the consulting firm's performance be satisfactory, they may be \nselected  for  the  follow-on  capacity  development  TA  using  single-source  selection.  This  is \nbecause the follow-on capacity development TA will be a natural continuation of this TA and will \nrequire extensive use of not just the results but also the raw data developed under this TA. The \nTA is expected to commence in October 2009 and be completed after 12 months, in October \n2010. Seminars and workshops will be held to disseminate the output of the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for the Karnataka State Highway Network Improvement Strategy, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced efficiency in  Percentage of links on  Road transport statistics  Projects identified will be \nthe planning,  CRN where volume    implemented on time. \nprogramming, policy  exceeds capacity reduced  Traffic surveys   \nformulation, and  by 30% in next 5 years    Risks \nmonitoring of the road  and 70% in next 10 years.
