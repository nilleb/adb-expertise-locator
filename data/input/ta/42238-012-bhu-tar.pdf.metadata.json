INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bhutan requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen air transport regulatory and operational \nperformance. ADB approved the TA concept paper on 15 November 2011. On 1 September \n2011, an ADB fact-finding mission held discussions on preparations for the TA with the Ministry \nof Information and Communication (MOIC), the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), and the \nDepartment  of  Public  Accounts  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  mission  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  government  on  the  TA  project\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangement,  and  terms  of  reference.1 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Air transport activity in Bhutan is expected to increase substantially as a result of (i) the \ngovernment\u2019s continued effort to market tourist attractions in the country, and (ii) the introduction \nof domestic air travel to provide access to and promote tourism in the less-developed regions. In \n2010, the air passenger volume at Paro International Airport, the country\u2019s only operational \nairport, reached about 127,000 passengers\u2014more than triple the estimated 33,900 passengers \nin 2001. Based on the updated air traffic forecast, assuming physical capacity improvements \nkeep pace with demand, air passenger traffic could grow to about 491,000 passengers per year \nby 2020, of which about 12% (60,000 passengers) would be carried on the new domestic \nservices.  This  anticipated  traffic  growth  emphasizes  the  need  to  ensure  optimum  sector \nperformance and service delivery in terms of safety, security, and capacity. \n \n3.  The  air  transport  sector  assessment,  carried  out  under  an  ongoing  ADB  project \npreparatory TA, has revealed inadequacies in several critical areas, particularly the institutional, \nlegal, and regulatory frameworks, as well as the role and capacity of the DCA.2 Since being \nestablished in January 1986 under the MOIC, the DCA has been responsible for providing both \nthe  regulatory  and  operational  functions  for  civil  aviation.  This  dual  role,  where  the  DCA \nregulates  its  own  operations,  creates  the  potential  for  conflict  of  interest.  The  DCA  has \ndeveloped an organization plan to separate the two functions, although both functions would \nremain within the same organization and under the same overall leadership. In the interest of \naviation safety and in keeping with best international practice, the regulatory and operational \nfunctions performed by the DCA need to be separated more clearly. Ideally, the DCA would \nevolve into a regulatory authority outside the government structure rather than functioning as a \ndepartment of the government subject to the constraints of the civil service.3 The operational \nfunctions currently performed by the DCA could then be handed off to a commercial entity, \nincorporated as a government-owned company, free to function on a commercial basis. New \nlegislation and amendments to existing laws would be required to facilitate this transformation. \n \n4.  The DCA currently has 193 employees and is substantively understaffed in several \nareas, particularly regulation and inspection. A review of the DCA operations concluded that it is \nunable to provide total and effective regulatory oversight of airworthiness, flight operations, and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 November 2011. \n2  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Air Transport Connectivity Enhancement Project. Manila (TA 7633-BHU, \n$600,000, approved on 5 November). \n3  As the requirements for regulating and operating the civil aviation infrastructure are becoming more specialized, \nsalaries set by civil service rules are not sufficient to recruit and retain skilled staff. As an operating department of \nthe MOIC, the DCA and all matters pertaining to human resources management, including staffing levels, salaries \nand employment conditions, are subject to the Bhutan Civil Service Rules and Regulations. \n ", "2   \naerodromes regulation because  of  staff shortages,  lack  of qualified  staff  in  several  of the \nrequired areas of inspection, and inadequate training and skills upgrading.4 With new domestic \nairports expected to become operational during 2012, it is essential to train and upgrade the \nskills of existing staff. \n \n5.  The Civil Aviation Act 2000, a revision of the first Civil Aviation Act enacted in 1990 and \nreenacted on 14 July 2000, serves as the enabling legislation for administration of civil aviation \nin Bhutan. The act is deficient as an instrument for regulating and administering civil aviation in \nseveral areas; it is also inconsistent in some areas. The Bhutan Air Navigation Regulations \n(BANRs)  were  intended  to  interpret  and  apply  the  provisions  of  the  act,  but  significant \ninconsistencies between the act and the BANRs have emerged and require reconciliation. The \nact needs to be updated and the BANRs must be readdressed to ensure consistency and \ncompleteness. \n \n6.  The TA\u2014ADB\u2019s first in the country\u2019s air transport sector\u2014is timely and targeted to \nstrengthen  regulatory  and  operational  performance  by  improving  institutional,  legal,  and \nregulatory frameworks, as well as upgrading the DCA\u2019s capacity. It will facilitate institutional and \norganizational  capacity  development  to  support  the  government\u2019s  plan  to  develop  a  safe, \nreliable, and efficient network of domestic air transport connecting urban and rural centers. This \nwill help overcome the current limitations of road transport and provide accessibility. It will also \npromote  tourism  and  high-value  agriculture  in  the  less-developed  regions.  The  TA  will \ncomplement  the  ensuing  ADB-assisted  project  in  the  2012  pipeline,  the  Air  Transport \nConnectivity Enhancement Project.5 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be improved air transport connectivity and the outcome will be improved \nair transport regulatory and operational performance. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The key activities of the TA are (i) preparing updates for the Civil Aviation Act 2000 and \napplicable BANRs to reflect the current needs; (ii) formulating a framework for restructuring the \nDCA and drafting necessary legislation, which will enable effective separation of the regulatory \nand operational functions, and provide the necessary autonomy; and (iii) providing technical \ntraining in the critical areas of regulatory oversight and airport operations. \n \n9.  The two international experts (civil aviation institutional specialist and civil aviation legal \nexpert) and one national legal expert will be engaged to (i) review the act; (ii) determine and \ndevelop amendments to reflect the current needs in terms of empowerment, specification of \ndelegated authority, and provision of authority where none  currently exists; (iii) review the \ncurrent BANRs, identify any inconsistencies that need to be rectified, and compile appropriate \ninternational  regulations  for  updating;  (iv)  develop  a  preliminary  restructuring  and \nimplementation plan for effective separation of regulatory and operational functions; and (v) \nassess and prioritize critical areas of technical training requirements for DCA staff. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "  3 \n \n10.  To enable restructuring of the DCA, a framework and legislation will be developed with \nthe aim of separating its regulatory functions from its operations, which the government views \nas a fundamental need over the long term. The approach that might be most appropriate for \nBhutan would be to create (i) a civil aviation authority to function as the regulator of civil \naviation; and (ii) a corporate entity (an airports company) to function as the operator of the \nairports, air traffic, and the air navigation system in the country. This would require restructuring \nthe DCA by establishing the civil aviation authority outside the government structure, reporting \nto a board, rather than functioning as a department of the government subject to the constraints \nof the civil service. The operational functions currently performed by the DCA would then be \nhanded over to a government-owned airports company, free to function on a commercial basis. \n \n11.  To provide technical training in the critical areas of regulatory oversight and airport \noperations, key DCA staff will attend technical training courses conducted at internationally \nrecognized civil aviation academies or institutions. The initial need assessment highlighted \ndeficiencies in safety oversight airworthiness inspection, airport planning and operations, airport \ncertification, and air traffic services. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis in the amount of $300,000 equivalent from \nADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV).6 The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. The disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The MOIC will be the executing agency and the DCA will be the implementing agency \nfor the TA. A project management unit is not envisaged. The government\u2019s in-kind contribution \nwill be the provision of office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff, and other \nlogistical  support.  The  government  will  provide  all  available  reports,  existing  acts  and \nregulations,  and  other  pertinent  data.  It  will  also  facilitate  interagency  coordination  and \napplicable permits as necessary. The MOIC may use the advance payment facility to finance \nexpenditures under the TA. \n \n14.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works,  if  any,  under  the  TA  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will \nengage the consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  For  the  main  portion  of  the  TA,  a  firm  of  two  international \nconsultants and one national consultant will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based \nselection procedure, with biodata technical proposal and a 90:10 proportion of quality to cost.7 \nThe services will be implemented over about 6 months and will require about 3.5 person-months \nof international consultant services and 2 person-months of national consultant services. The \noutline terms of reference is in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The expected outputs will be disseminated in the form of consultants\u2019 reports comprising \na report on DCA restructuring and implementation plan; and a report on (i) amendments to the \n                                                \n6  Excluding the government\u2019s contributions in form of office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff, \nreports, and other logistical support. \n7  The 90:10 proportion of quality to cost is proposed because the assignment, which involves civil aviation regulation \nand institutional capacity, requires priority consideration for quality. \n ", "4   \nCivil Aviation Act 2000, (ii) amendments to the BANRs, and (iii) enabling legislation necessary \nto  adopt  the  DCA  restructuring  plan  to  separate  the  regulatory  and  operational  functions. \nProgress will be monitored using intended outcomes and outputs described in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for Strengthening the Air Transport Regulatory and Operational \nPerformance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  Number of air passengers per  DCA annual report  Assumption \nImproved air  year increases to 431,400 for  Physical \ntransport  international and to 59,900 for  capacity \nconnectivity  domestic by 2020 (2010 baseline:  improvements \n127,181 for international and zero  keep pace with \nfor domestic)  demand \nOutcome  Completion by 2014:  DCA monitoring report  Assumption \nImproved air  Separate and autonomous    Government \ntransport regulatory  organizations are established\u2014 remains \nand operational  one to function as the regulator of  committed to \nperformance   civil aviation and one to function  improving \nas the operator of the airports  regulatory \n  framework and \n  restructuring of \nthe DCA \nOutputs   Completion by 2014:   DCA monitoring report  Assumption \n1.

Background and Objectives \n1.  The Government of Bhutan requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to (i) review the Civil Aviation Act 2000; (ii) determine \nand develop amendments to reflect the current needs in terms of empowerment, specification of \ndelegated authority, and provision of authority where none currently exists; and (iii) review the \ncurrent Bhutan Air Navigation Regulations (BANRs), identify any inconsistencies that need to be \nrectified, and compile appropriate international regulations for updating. To enable restructuring \nof the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), a framework and legislation and/or amendment to the \nCivil Aviation Act will be developed to separate its regulatory functions from its operations. The \ngoal is to create (i) a civil aviation authority to function as the regulator of civil aviation; and (ii) a \ncorporate entity (an airports company) to function as the operator of the airports, air traffic, and \nthe  air  navigation  system  in  the  country.  This  would  require  restructuring  the  DCA  by \nestablishing the civil aviation authority outside the government structure, reporting to a board, \nrather than functioning as a department of the government subject to the constraints of the civil \nservice.
