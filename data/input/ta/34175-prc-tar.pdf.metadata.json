During the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) 2005 Country Programming Mission, the \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  confirmed  its  request  for  technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare a rural road development strategy. In response, an ADB Fact-\nFinding  Mission  visited  the  PRC  in  June  2005  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2005 \ncountry assistance plan for the PRC.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In recent decades, the PRC has achieved rapid economic growth and poverty reduction. \nIts gross domestic product has grown more than 9% per year since the 1980s and the incidence \nof rural poverty fell from 33% in 1978 to just 2.8% in 2004. Propelling the country\u2019s robust \ngrowth and drastic poverty reduction were massive investments in roads. The country\u2019s highway \nnetwork grew from 1.16 million kilometers (km) in 1995 to 1.86 million km in 2004, for an \naverage annual increase of 6%. The length of expressways increased from 147 km in 1988 to \n34,287 km in 2004, a more than 100-fold expansion. Class I highways increased from 196 km in \n1980 to 33,522 km in 2004, or 29% per year on average. Despite the Government\u2019s remarkable \nperformance, transport conditions continue to pose a challenge for the remaining 30 million rural \npoor. Many of them live in areas that are partially or completely isolated, which increases their \ntransportation costs and restricts their access to basic goods and services. It also keeps the \npoor from taking advantage of the job opportunities generated by the PRC\u2019s economic growth. \n \n3.  The Ministry of Communications (MOC) classifies county, township, and village roads as \nrural roads, which totaled 2.9 million km in 2004, or 85% of the total road network of 3.3 million \nkm. Of the total rural roads, 479,372 km are county roads, 945,180 km are township roads, and \n1,473,534 km are village roads. County roads are often found in urban areas,3 while village \nroads, which account for about half of rural roads, link farmers to markets within a locality. \n \n4.  Rural transport plays a huge role in economic development and poverty reduction in the \ncountryside.  Rural  roads  directly  influence  the  daily  lives  of  the  rural  poor  and  contribute \nsubstantially  to  poverty  reduction.  The  construction  or  improvement  of  rural  roads  lowers \ntransport costs, cuts travel time, and enhances the quality of transport services. In turn, rural \nroads encourage villagers to travel to markets, make more frequent use of educational and \nhealth facilities, and avail themselves of agricultural extension services. Reliable access to input \nand  output  markets  stimulates  higher  levels  of  production  in  cash  crop  farming,  thereby \nspeeding up the transition from subsistence farming to a market economy. In addition, by \nreducing the distance that people have to travel to reach major roads, rural roads help diversify \nincome sources, raise the productivity of poor households, and promote contact with other \nregions. The development of a rural road network is therefore critical for promoting efficient and \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in rural areas and in the country as a whole. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 30 March 2005. \n3  Urban roads are defined as all roads within the boundary of a county or district that has been declared an urban \ncounty or district. A prefecture-level city comprises both urban and rural counties and districts, thus in such cases, \ncities control both urban and rural roads. ", "2     \n5.  MOC is responsible for planning the national highway network, which totals 129,815 km, \nor 4% of the entire road network of 3.3 million km. Under MOC guidelines, the Provincial \nCommunications Department (PCD) is responsible for the planning, development, maintenance, \nand  administration  of  the  provincial  highway  network.  PCD  and  municipal  and  county \ncommunications bureaus are tasked with planning and administering the rural road sector, \nincluding constructing and maintaining the rural road network. MOC provides PCD with policy \nguidance  and  technical  support  through  national  policies,  regulations,  and  design  and \nconstruction standards.4 \n \n6.  While  national  and  provincial  road  networks  are  generally  adequate,  the  rural  road \nnetwork is underdeveloped in terms of both quality and extent and does not provide access to \nlarge parts of the hinterland. Furthermore, most rural roads are in poor condition because of \ndeficiencies  in  design  and  construction,  inadequate  maintenance,  damage  caused  by \noverloaded  vehicles,  and  insufficient  funding.  The  technical  standards  of  rural  roads  are \nextremely low: only 11% are class III or above. Village roads are even worse, with merely 2% \nbeing rated class III or above. Only 20% of county roads, 15% of township roads, and 9% of \nvillage roads are paved. About 71% of rural roads are dirt roads, making them highly vulnerable \nto bad weather. As a result, many townships and villages still depend on earth tracks that have \nno drainage system, making them unsuitable for motorized traffic and impassible during the \nrainy season. \n \n7.  The Government\u2019s road development policies stress the importance of developing rural \nroads, particularly roads that would connect farmers to rural markets and thereby help reduce \npoverty.  During  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005),  the  Government  constructed \napproximately 72,000 km of rural roads at a cost of CNY60.9 billion. The Government will invest \nCNY100 billion more in rural roads during the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), so that by 2010, \npaved roads will link all villages in the eastern part of the country, 80% of villages in central \nPRC, and 90% of villages in the western part of the country. \n \n8.  Despite the country\u2019s extensive road investment plan during the 11th Five-Year Plan, it \ndoes not yet have an adequate planning system, particularly for rural roads. Currently, provincial \nplanning departments prepare road development plans based on county plans while county \nplans are based on township plans. The primary objective of their plans is to connect all towns \nwith  paved  roads  and  all  villages  with  all-weather  roads.  Authorities  in  lower  levels  of \ngovernment consolidate individual projects to form provinces\u2019 investment plans, but give little \nconsideration  to  other  factors,  such  as  the  overall  network  and  the  economic  activities  in \nparticular  areas.  Given  the  project-by-project  approach  and  the  fragmented  nature  of \nadministrative responsibilities, sections of road to be constructed or improved are often selected in \nan ad hoc manner. Relatively little attention is paid to the integration of the rural road network. \n \n9.  Data  are  collected  in  rudimentary  form.  Basic  data  on  the  condition  of  roads  and \nbridges\u2014road length, start and finish points, road surface type, road width, and features along \nparticular sections\u2014are kept at the county and township levels. However, monitoring is often \nhampered by the method to store the information: data are filed in printed form without cross-\nindexing between local administrative authorities. A nationwide inventory of rural roads by \nprovince needs to be compiled using MOC\u2019s functional road classification system and this \n                                                 \n4  PCD\u2019s road management operations are financed by fund transfers from the provincial government, fees and tolls, \nand sales of state bonds. In relation to investments in roads, PCD receives grant funding from MOC to supplement \nits own funds and domestic and international loans. ", "    3\ninventory will need to be updated on a regular basis. Therefore a more rigorous and centralized \ndatabase must be established to ensure the availability of information for planning purposes. \n \n10.  Most  rural  road  projects  lack  geometric  and  structural  standards  with  which  local \ngovernments must comply,5 such as drainage and safety features. Also lacking are systematic \nprocesses and tools for assessing and monitoring the quality of the rural road network that are \nadapted  to  local  governments\u2019  resources  and  capabilities.  Furthermore,  local  government \nofficials tend not to understand the importance of drainage and suitable drainage structures in \nrelation  to  road  safety  and  maintenance.  Finally,  there  are  no  requirements  for  pavement \nmaterial  for  most  rural  roads,  which  affects  their  longevity.  Usually  the  gravel  used  is \nsubstandard and prone to damage from inadequate drainage or overloaded vehicles. \n \n11.  Comprehensive strategies to strengthen rural road planning and programming need to \nbe established promptly to improve the integration and efficiency of the rural transportation \nnetwork and ensure its consistency with development and land use plans. The strategies must \ntake into account rural and agricultural development, national transport policy, road sector \nreforms, local government administration, and planning frameworks at the local government \nlevel. \n \n12.  Adequate  maintenance  is  crucial  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rural  roads,  a \nresponsibility of local administrative units. However, the quality of rural roads does not seem to \nbe systematically monitored by the higher authorities concerned and  there is no comprehensive \nplanning  for  rehabilitation.  Furthermore,  maintenance  planning  often  hinges  on  subjective \nassessments, mainly because of local governments\u2019 lack of resources for maintaining their road \nnetworks. Little dissemination of the activities or knowledge needed to monitor performance is \napparent across counties. While local authorities draft plans for routine maintenance work, \nperiodic maintenance is rather budget driven, and a systematic, preventive approach is lacking. \nAs a result, a backlog of work exists in relation to bringing the network up to a fully maintainable \nstandard. \n \n13.  No official funding channel is available for the maintenance of township or village roads \nnor is a systematic arrangement in place whereby higher levels of government (PCD or MOC) \ncan  fund  the  development  of  rural  roads.  Therefore  a  reliable  funding  mechanism  for \nmaintaining  and  rehabilitating  rural  roads  must  be  designed,  one  that  includes  attractive \nincentives  (including  financial  perquisites),  to  help  local  governments  maintain  their  roads. \nBecause funds for maintenance are limited, a simple method for evaluating and prioritizing \nmaintenance  work  must  also  be  established  to  streamline  work  programming  and  ensure \neffective use of funds. \n \n14.  In addition to the lack of funds, the lack of qualified technical and managerial personnel, \ntraining resources, and equipment often hampers local governments\u2019 maintenance efforts. To \nraise  performance  standards,  the  cost-effectiveness  of  maintenance  operations  must  be \nassessed to identify the types of work that could be better performed by private contractors. At \nthe  same  time,  local  governments  must  develop  their  capability  to  contract  out  for  road \nmaintenance. In tandem, start-up assistance must be extended to local road maintenance \ncontractors in rural areas and ways to generate employment for the rural poor must be identified. \nA suitable performance monitoring system must also be put in place. \n \n                                                 \n5  Geometric standards only apply to the construction of roads above class IV. ", "4     \n15.  ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy assigns high priority to rural infrastructure, including \nrural roads. By opening up new markets and thereby encouraging higher levels of agricultural \nproduction, rural  roads  promote  larger  rural income  streams  that  contribute  significantly  to \npoverty reduction. Rural infrastructure development should be combined with empowering local \ncommunities, promoting good governance through decentralization, and strengthening local \ngovernment  institutions.  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC  emphasizes  the \nimportance of developing the road infrastructure, including rural roads. In the road sector, the \nstrategy\u2019s key concerns include (i) supporting the formulation of a policy framework for a rural \nroads investment program, (ii) putting more focus on planning and maintenance systems, and \n(iii) increasing private sector participation. Given this background, the proposed TA will review \nthe  status  of  the  rural  road  sector  and  develop  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  boost  the \neffectiveness of rural road investments for sustainable economic development and poverty \nreduction. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The TA aims to help the Government formulate and prepare a rural road development \nstrategy to enhance the effectiveness of rural road investments in meeting the PRC\u2019s rural \ntransport needs. To achieve this objective, the TA will (i) undertake a detailed assessment of the \nrural  road  sector  in  selected  pilot  provinces,  in  particular,  of  planning,  programming,  and \nmaintenance; (ii) identify strategic-priority projects to be included in the 11th Five-Year Plan for \nrural  road  development  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  objectives;  and  (iii)  help  strengthen \ninstitutional capacity for implementing rural road interventions. This strategy will serve as the \nGovernment\u2019s key document for strengthening the rural road sector in the 11th Five-Year Plan. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  International consultants, supported by domestic consultants, will be engaged to help the \nGovernment prepare the rural road development strategy. The TA will be undertaken in close \nconsultation with the national and local governments and will take into consideration all previous \nstudies carried out by the Government and by ADB and other multilateral agencies. The TA will \ninvolve  analytical  research;  fieldwork;  training;  and  stakeholder  consultations  with  the \nGovernment, provincial governments, and local stakeholders. \n \n18.  Key activities include (i) reviewing development plans for rural roads; (ii) identifying \nissues  and  options  in  relation  to  development  needs,  policy  reforms,  and  regulatory \nrequirements in line with the Government\u2019s development goals; (iii) undertaking case studies in \nthe provinces of Shandong, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi and assessing issues and options for \nthe sector in each province; (iv) identifying high-priority projects to be included in the 11th Five-\nYear  Plan  for  rural  road  development  in  each  of  the  pilot  provinces  and  preparing \nimplementation  and  financing  plans;  (v)  preparing  a  rural  road  maintenance  manual;  (vi) \ndeveloping a rural road development strategy that integrates an appropriate implementation \nframework and mechanisms for strengthening the planning, programming, and maintenance of \nrural roads and the institutional framework for implementing rural road interventions; and (vii) \ndisseminating best practices through a national workshop. \n ", "    5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $450,000 equivalent, of which $212,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $238,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government \nrequested ADB to finance $350,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$138,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  MOC  will  finance  the  remainder  of  the  TA  cost  ($100,000 \nequivalent), which will be used to cover office accommodation and other facilities and services \nrequired to implement the TA. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The TA will require about 22 person-months of consulting services (7 international and \nabout 15 domestic) spread over 8 months, including fieldwork. The consultants will be engaged \nby ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development \nBank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  A  team  of  international  consultants,  in  association  with  domestic \nconsulting firm(s), will be engaged following the quality- and cost-based selection method, and \nbiodata proposals will be required.  The international consultants will provide expertise in (i) \ntransport policy and planning; and (ii) maintenance and management, particularly specialized in \npolicy and regulation. The domestic consultants shall have expertise in (i) transport planning, \npolicy, and regulation; (ii) maintenance, and (iii) management and institutional strengthening. \nAppendix 3 presents the outline terms of reference for consulting services.  \n \n21.  MOC will be the executing agency and will be responsible for supervising and monitoring \nTA activities and for liaising with Government agencies and organizations. MOC will (i) ensure \nthe cooperation of concerned Government agencies, and (ii) provide the consultants with the \nassistance needed to implement the TA. MOC and other ministries will provide appropriate \npolicy guidance to the consultants. The TA is expected to begin in February 2006 and be \ncompleted  by  September  2006.  To  strengthen  institutional  capacity,  the  TA  will  finance \noverseas training programs in the areas of planning, programming, and maintenance. MOC will \nprovide  the  consultants  with  all  relevant  materials,  recent  studies, and  reports  required  to \nimplement the TA. The consultants will maintain close contact with MOC and keep MOC and \nADB informed of their progress and findings. Tripartite meetings involving the Government, ADB \nstaff, and the consultants will be held in the PRC to provide advice and guidance to the \nconsultants and review their reports. The consultants will procure equipment in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n22.  The consultants will submit reports to ADB as follows: (i) an inception report 2 weeks \nfollowing the commencement of services, (ii) an interim report 12 weeks after commencement, \n(iii) a draft final report 20 weeks after commencement, and (iii) a final report 2 weeks after \nreceiving all comments from MOC. Within 4 weeks of the submission of the draft final report, a \nnational workshop will be held in Beijing to disseminate the findings of the TA. Each report \nshould be submitted in English and Chinese to Ministry of Finance, National Development \nReform Commission, and MOC. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Rural Road Development Strategy, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.
