INTRODUCTION \n \n1.   More than 95% of all coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, to date, have been in urban \nareas. COVID-19 has brought the developing member countries\u2019 (DMC) cities onto the frontline \nand exposed their vulnerabilities.1 The benefits of agglomeration\u2014high density, lower mobility \ncosts, regional and international connectivity\u2014that made DMC cities the engines of economic \ngrowth in the region, have left these cities exposed to the risk of COVID-19, making them the \nbiggest challenge in the fight against the pandemic.  COVID-19 is an impetus to strengthen DMC \ncities\u2019 financial resiliency and domestic resource mobilization, and to increase their capacity for \nimplementing quality infrastructure investments such that these cities can build back better and \nlead the economic recovery of our DMCs.  \n \n2.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nand its operational priorities, in particular priority 4 (making cities more livable) and priority 6 \n(strengthening governance and institutional capacity).2 The TA is also aligned with the operational \nplan for private sector operations, 2019\u20132024 and is included in the 2020 work plan of ADB\u2019s \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Thematic Group.3  The TA will leverage Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) resources, knowledge, and partnerships to help cities in DMCs increase their technical, \nfinancial, and managerial capacity to develop quality municipal infrastructure, improve their \nresource mobilization, and enhance their competitiveness and resilience post-COVID-19.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.   Quality  infrastructure  investment  (QII)  drives  economic  growth.4 It  also  increases \nresilience.  Many  services  that  have  been  directly  impacted  by  the  pandemic\u2014water  and \nsanitation, solid waste, health, education, housing, and transport\u2014are provided by subnational \ngovernments,  including  states,  provinces,  and  municipalities  in  ADB  DMCs. 5  Chronic \nunderinvestment in urban and social infrastructure in many DMC cities provides a significant \nopportunity for QII to lead economic recovery in the region post-COVID-19. \n  \n4.  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, ADB estimated that DMCs needed to invest almost $1.7 \ntrillion annually in infrastructure from 2016 to 2030. With COVID-19, costs for infrastructure \ndelivery are increasing, and it can be reasonably assumed that the infrastructure gap will widen. \nTo close this gap, DMCs must take a three-pronged approach to maximizing value-for-money in \ninfrastructure planning and procurement: (i) improve the efficiency of infrastructure spending; (ii) \n \n1  Under the Creating Investable Cities (CIC) initiative, \u201ccity\u201d refers to subnational government, local or regional, that \nhas some responsibilities for citizen service provision and some autonomy with respect to budget, assets, and tax. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  ADB. Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations (2019-2024). \n4  G20 Principles of Quality Infrastructure Investment Details (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n3). The six G20 Principles of Quality Infrastructure Investment are (i) maximizing the positive impact of infrastructure \nto achieve sustainable growth and development; (ii) raising economic efficiency in view of life-cycle cost; (iii) \nintegrating environmental considerations in infrastructure investments; (iv) building resilience against natural \ndisasters and other risks; (v) integration social considerations in infrastructure investment; and (v) strengthening \ninfrastructure governance. \n5  ADB. Livable Cities: Post-COVID New Normal, put forth by the Urban Sector Group discussing the impact of COVID-\n19. Guidance note: August 2020. Guidance on this evolving topic is also being put forth by the Transport Sector \nGroup, Education Sector Group, and Public\u2013Private Partnership Thematic Group. \n ", "2 \nmobilize more internal resources, including through taxes and fees; and (iii) raise more capital \nfrom the private sector, including through public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).6  \n \n5.  As DMCs emerge from mobilizing emergency social and economic relief, they will look to \ninfrastructure development to kick-start their recoveries and will revisit masterplans to prioritize \nprojects that will make them more resilient and competitive under the \u201cnew-normal.\u201d But most \ncities in DMCs lack the ability to apply QII principles and bring efficiency, inclusivity, resilience, \ncompetitiveness,  and  sustainability  to  their  project  selection,  preparation,  and  procurement \nprocesses, while ensuring sound public finances.7   \n \n6.  PPPs are an important modality for attracting private capital and expertise to infrastructure \nprojects, but this modality of infrastructure and services procurement has been significantly \nunderutilized  in  Asia,  especially  in  cities.8 Scaling  up  PPPs  requires  a  proper  enabling \nenvironment, sound financial management practices, and good governance. To make these \npartnerships bankable, projects usually require government support; however, cities in Asia have \nlimited legal and regulatory avenues to sustainably mobilize resources. \n \n7.  Even where no roadblocks exist, Asian cities lack multi-level and inter-agency coordination \nmechanisms  and  processes  to  enhance  mobilization  of  own-source  revenue.  Cities  could \nprudently borrow from national development banks or capital markets, but most cities in Asia and \nthe Pacific do not have credit ratings for investors to assess credit risks. As a result, cities, unable \nto mobilize resources to support PPPs, are finding very little success in utilizing PPPs for \ninfrastructure  in  Asia.  But  whichever  way  a  city  decides  to  mobilize  resources  to  finance \ninfrastructure, successful implementation will require a clear legislative and regulatory framework, \nincluding PPP laws and policies, and fiscal management guidelines that support national and \nsubnational PPPs to increase investors\u2019 confidence in the debt-raising and debt-management \ncapacities of the city.  \n \n8.  Finally, QII is complex and the capacity for implementation in cities is poor. Most cities in \nAsia and the Pacific do not have the technical, managerial, or financial capacity and tools to \nidentify, screen, and prepare QII pipelines, and lack the managerial competence to sustainably \nmobilize domestic resources to implement them.9 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: increase in municipal quality infrastructure \ninvestment.10 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcomes:  (i)  cities\u2019  capacity  for  early-stage \nidentification and preparation of quality infrastructure increased. (ii) cities\u2019 capability to sustainably \n \n6  Value-for-money can be derived from, among other things, improvements in infrastructure delivery, including \nincreasing  operational  efficiency,  granting  incentivized  finance,  project  innovation,  and  better  technical  and \nmanagerial skills. \n7  McKinsey Global Institute. 2017.

Realizing the Potential of Public-Private Partnerships to Advance Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Development, \nAnalysis of IJ Global transaction data during 2000\u20132016 showed that Asia accounted for only 5% of all PPP projects \nin education, healthcare, housing, and other social sectors. By contrast, Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development countries accounted for 90% in these areas. Manila. \n9  PPP Knowledge Lab. 2017.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  To mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, DMCs across Asia and the Pacific have \nprovided massive stimulus packages to support their economies as gross domestic product (GDP) \ncontracts sharply throughout the region.12 With rising debt-to-GDP ratios, bridging the significant \ninfrastructure gap will require a coordinated effort to increase the efficiency of public infrastructure \nspending, mobilize domestic resources and development partner support, and attract private \ncapital to quality infrastructure. The TA project will tie in principles of quality infrastructure with \nsustainable resource mobilization and capacity building to help select cities in Asia and the Pacific, \nhereafter called partner cities, develop plans for bridging their infrastructure gap.13  \n \n11.  Output 1: Frameworks to improve cities\u2019 ability to implement quality infrastructure \ninvestment developed. This output will support the development of standardized frameworks to \nassess  opportunities  and  challenges  associated  with  partner  cities  mobilizing  resources  to \nimplement QII.14 The output envisages at least three frameworks discussed below. Sector-\nspecific frameworks, for example in municipal health, public asset redevelopment, or social \nhousing, that support sector development strategies may also be supported under this output.  \n \n12.  Output 1a: Country-level legal and institutional framework.  This framework will be \nused to evaluate the enabling environment to support subnational domestic resource mobilization \n(DRM) in DMCs, and concomitantly to operationalize elements of QII principles.15 The framework \nwill be used to analyze a partner city\u2019s legislative, regulatory, institutional, and governance \nframework;  and  its  systems,  rules,  and  procedures  for  subnational  development  financing, \nincluding the fiscal framework that regulates city and municipal entities\u2019 access to external \nresources, such as loans, bonds, or equity, to finance new projects or monetize operating assets. \nThe analysis will extend to financial and capital markets that support subnational domestic \nresource mobilization in the relevant DMC. \n \n13.  Output  1b:  City  resource  mobilization  and  creditworthiness  framework.  This \nframework will evaluate the DRM potential of a city to sustain key investments and accommodate \nfuture investment needs and priorities.16 The framework will assess a partner city\u2019s fiscal health, \nanalyzing the city\u2019s existing tax and asset base and intergovernmental transfers, and identify \nopportunities  for  improved  financial  management,  governance,  and  resource  mobilization. \nAlternatives for strengthening a city\u2019s fiscal position around credit strength, cost recovery reforms, \n \n11  The design and monitoring framework are in Appendix 1. \n12 ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook Supplement, June 2020: Lockdown, Loosening, and Asia\u2019s Growth \nProspects. Manila. \n13 Under the TA, the ADB will sign an agreement with each partner city, wherein the partner city will consent to, among \nothers, confidentially disclose priority investment plans and provide historical and current spatial, demographic, \neconomic, and financial data. \n14  The standardized frameworks will allow (i) dissemination of best practices; (ii) comparative analysis; (iii) scalability; \nand (iv) capturing learnings. \n15  This framework will be developed in coordination with Law and Policy Reform group in the Office of the General \nCounsel. The framework will leverage methodologies and existing information in ADB\u2019s Public\u2013Private Partnership \nMonitor, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA), the World Bank\u2019s \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment, and sector assessments from ADB resident \nmissions. \n16  The framework will leverage the methodologies in World Bank\u2019s Subnational PEFA and ADB\u2019s City Infrastructure \nInvestment Priority Programming toolkit.  \n ", "4 \naccess to financial markets, and additional revenue streams, including land value capture and \nasset recycling, will be evaluated.  \n \n14.  Output 1c: Quality infrastructure framework. This framework will use QII principles to \nprovide early-stage cross-thematic and multi-sectoral assistance to develop a quality municipal \ninfrastructure pipeline to improve a partner city\u2019s resilience and competitiveness under the new \nnormal. The framework will tie in key functions of climate and disaster resilience, planning, \nbudgeting and financing that can maximize the positive social, economic, environmental, and \ndevelopment impacts of municipal infrastructure.17 The framework will be continuously updated \nto capture learnings from output 4 as subsector indicators, benchmarks, and case studies are \ndeveloped, At the project-level, the framework will focus on operationalizing QII in partner cities, \nincluding through project prioritization, procurement options analysis, PPP screening, and value-\nfor-money analysis.  \n \n15.  Output 2: City credit-rating tool developed. The TA will leverage the quantitative and \nqualitative factors from the country-level legal and regulatory framework (output 1a) and the city \nresource mobilization and creditworthiness framework (output 1b) to develop a credit-rating tool \nfor cities in Asia and the Pacific. The tool will be continuously updated to include overriding factors \nand caps to establish this credit rating. The application of the tool as part of output 4 and the \nresulting credit profile will guide the partner city\u2019s strategy to meet infrastructure needs through \nsound public financial management. \n \n16.  Output 3: Cities\u2019 capacity to implement quality infrastructure strengthened. The \noutput will support technical and managerial capacity building of senior city leadership in partner \ncities in areas such as procurement of quality infrastructure, healthy city planning, and city \nleadership.18 Capacity building in socially, economically, and financially relevant areas such as \ntourism, social housing, asset-recycling, gender and inclusiveness, and land value capture could \nalso be supported under this output.   \n \n17.  Output  4:  Partner  city  action  plans  developed  to  support  early-stage  quality \ninfrastructure investment pipelines. This output will support the application of the above \nframeworks and tools in partner cities, across their finance, budgeting and planning departments, \nto identify (i) a pipeline of prioritized QII; (ii) strategy and sector reforms to enhance subnational \nresource mobilization to implement this prioritized pipeline; and (iii) a set of recommendations to \nimprove the enabling environment for developing quality municipal infrastructure.19 Under this \noutput, partner cities\u2019 action plans will be developed to help these cities improve their public \ninvestment management and effectively leverage development partner support.  The action plans \nwill provide the roadmap for these cities to increase their competitiveness and resilience and close \nthe gap for quality infrastructure investments. \n \n18.  ADB experience: From 2009 to 2019, nearly $19 billion in ADB loans and TA had some \nupstream PPP component, helping DMCs establish PPP laws and policies; PPP units; project \nselection, approval, and management guidelines; and fiscal risk management frameworks. More \n \n17  This framework will, to the extent possible, leverage ongoing initiatives including SOURCE (https://public.sif-\nsource.org/source/) and the World Bank\u2019s PPP screening tool.  \n18  This capacity building will leverage ongoing initiatives from organizations like APMG\u2019s PPP Certification Program, \nInvestors Leadership Network (ILN), Global Center on Adaptation, the Stanford Global Projects Center, the Stanford \nLeaderships Academy for Development, and the Asian Development Bank Institute.  \n19  Following preliminary discussions with and an evaluation of the partner city, the TA will provide each partner city with \nthe services of a quality infrastructure planner, a PPP specialist, a municipal finance expert, and, if needed, a credit \nratings expert to build capacity and implement output 4.  \n ", "5 \nthan 80% of this support was at the national level. This TA project will leverage this upstream \nassistance to move the focus to subnational resource mobilization and PPPs. The TA will capture \nsubstantial lessons from the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility and the Office of Public\u2013\nPrivate  Partnership  Transaction  Advisory  Services,  wherein  most  municipal  projects  need \ngovernment support to become bankable and attractive to the private sector. \n \n19.  Early-stage assistance. Early stage assistance under the TA to help cities identify, \nprioritize, and screen investment portfolios complements the project-preparation focus of ADB-\nmanaged project preparation trust funds like the Cities Development Initiative for Asia, the Pacific \nProject Preparation Facility, the ASEAN Australia Smart Cities Fund, and transaction technical \nassistance. This early-stage work will show DMCs the benefits of operationalizing QII Principles.  \nThis approach can also identify reform programs and opportunities for DMC-specific sector \ndevelopment programs, local entities, and other regional assistance programs. \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s value addition\u2014knowledge, finance, and partnerships. It is estimated that Asia \nand the Pacific will have more than 200 large cities by 2030.20 To develop reach and scale, the \nTA will employ standardized frameworks and knowledge products with the aim of bringing them \nonline, if feasible. The frameworks and associated capacity development will support a strong \nOne ADB approach to partnering with select cities to disseminate good practices for QII, assess \nmunicipal financial management capacity, identify barriers to boosting private sector participation, \nand develop partner city action plans. With substantial experience in quality infrastructure, \nmunicipal finance, PPPs, and urban development in the region, ADB is well-positioned to drive \nthis process. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,789,000, of which (i) $307,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6), and (ii) $1,482,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by TASF-other sources. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.   ADB will administer the TA. The Public\u2013Private Partnership Thematic Group (PPP TG) \nwill be responsible for the administration and supervision of the TA. PPP TG will select, supervise, \nand evaluate consultants; organize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in \nthe workshops. Partner cities will be engaged by PPP TG in close coordination with ADB regional \ndepartments, resident missions, and the DMCs. PPP TG will continuously monitor and evaluate \nthe TA project\u2019s progress against the proposed outputs and outcomes. In line with the project\u2019s \nstrong One ADB approach, the team members will meet at least once annually to review \naccomplishments and discuss the work program going forward. \n \n23.
