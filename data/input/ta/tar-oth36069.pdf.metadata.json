", "I.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Pacific islands region faces increasing environmental and socioeconomic pressures \nexacerbated by global climate change and climate variability.1 The region, comprising more than \n30 million square kilometers of the Pacific Ocean with over 26 countries and territories, is \nunique and characterized by a high degree of ecosystem and species diversity, with high \nvulnerability to natural and environmental disasters. The region has also a high degree of \neconomic and cultural dependence on the natural environment, with an extraordinarily high \ndiversity of cultures and languages, traditional practices, and customs centered on the marine \nand coastal environment. \n \n2.  An ADB mission visited Fiji Islands and Samoa in May 2002 to attend a high level \nmeeting on Investing in Adaptation and the Second Round Table on Climate Change, Climate \nVariability and Sea Level Rise. The mission also met with senior officials from the governments \nof Fiji and Samoa, bilateral and multilateral aid agencies\u2019 representatives, and senior staff of \nmajor regional agencies including the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, South \nPacific  Geoscience  Commission,  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Community,  Forum  Secretariat, \nUniversity of the South Pacific, and World Meteorological Organization. The need for a technical \nassistance  (TA)  program  on  climate  adaptation  in  the  region  was  established,  and \nunderstandings were reached on the scope, objectives, and implementation arrangements.2 \nThe TA is included in the Pacific regional assistance program for 2002. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Adaptation3 to climate change and variability (CCV), and its impact is, ultimately, an \nissue of sustainable development. The integration of environment and development has been \nadopted in a broad range of international agreements. Under these agreements, climate change \nissues are specifically addressed through the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to \nadapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. Under the United Nations Framework \nConvention  on  Climate  Change,  small  island  developing  states  are  recognized  as  being \nparticularly vulnerable to climate change. \n \n4.  Even without climate change, Pacific island countries are already severely affected by \nclimate variability and extremes, and they remain extremely vulnerable to future changes in the \nregional climate that could increase the risks. They have clearly recognized the need to (i) \nreduce  their  vulnerability  to  these  increasing  risks  through  adaptation  processes,  and  (ii) \nstrengthen  their  human  and  institutional  capacities  to  assess,  plan,  and  respond  to  these \nchallenges.  \n \n5.  Climate change has been identified as a priority issue by the South Pacific Forum \nLeaders since the early 1990s through their annual Forum Communique. Concern reached its \nhighest level in October 2000 when the South Pacific Forum\u2019s leaders endorsed the Pacific \nislands framework for action on climate change, climate variability, and sea level rise. The \nframework forms the basis for effectively addressing issues related to CCV as a cooperative \nprocess among relevant stakeholders. While acknowledging that climate is a priority issue at the \nhighest levels of government, a lack of active support has been the case with key ministries \n                                                 \n1 Global climate change refers to a significant long-term change in the earth\u2019s climate system, whereas climate \nvariability refers to short- to medium-term fluctuations in the climate system, and usually includes extreme weather \nevents such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and other related disasters caused by weather phenomena. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 June 2002. \n3 Adaptation refers to actions or activities that people take to accommodate, cope with, or benefit from the effects of \nclimate variability and climate change ", "2   \nconcerned largely with matters of socioeconomic development, such as finance and planning, \nbased on the belief that climate is an environmental, not developmental, issue.  \n \n6.  CCV initiatives undertaken in the early 1990s were carried out in an adhoc fashion, \nthrough various sources of support and assistance (Supplementary Appendix A). Over the last 4 \nyears in particular, the Pacific Islands Climate Change Assistance Program (PICCAP) focused \nactivities into a comprehensive program. PICCAP successfully used a country team approach, \nwith  government-appointed  national  coordinators,  and  focused  on  building  the  in-country \ncapacity to undertake improved technical studies and to interpret these findings for the purposes \nof climate policy development. However, these efforts were preliminary and were only able to \nbuild small pools of human resource capacity. \n \n7.  There continues to be high political support for climate-related initiatives and a growing \nbelief  that  the  impacts  of  a  changing  climate  are  already  being  experienced  through  the \noccurrence  of  climate  extremes  such  as  unusually  intense  and/or  unseasonal  cyclones, \nflooding, droughts, and other natural phenomena. Recent scientific evidence4 indicates that \nclimate change will increase the frequency and/or intensity of some extreme events in the \ndecades  to  come.  While  the  costs  of  disasters  and  disaster  management  are  generally \nquantifiable, the identification of the cost of adaptation (the incremental costs) to climate change \nis recognized as a difficult task. Similarly, while disaster management activities are usually well \ndefined, it is more difficult to identify specific activities to address adaptation needs.  One way to \naddress this challenge is to integrate disaster management into a holistic risk reduction strategy \nthat  includes  adaptation  to  climate  change  within  the  broader  context  of  sustainable \ndevelopment. In addition, improving the ability to cope with current variability not only provides \nshort-term benefits in terms of risk reduction and sustainable development, but also increases \nthe adaptive capacity with respect to increasing risks from future global climate change. This \nlinking of short-term and long-term responses to climatic risks is a critical key in seeking an \nintegrative, participatory, and holistic approach to a complicated issue. This holistic framework \ncan be defined as \u201cadaptation through risk reduction\u201d (AtRR). \n \n8.  One important step in this approach is to improve the methods for estimating the impacts \nof climatic extremes on both natural and human systems as a result of both present variability \nand scenarios of future climate change.  The few scientific support programs relating to climate \nresearch, modeling, and monitoring in the region, including those supported under PICCAP, \nhave improved the understanding of climate change impacts. Yet most of the current work has \nfocused on biophysical impacts from average changes in climate.  Additional efforts are now \nrequired to increase understanding of climate change-related extremes and variability, in terms \nof  (i) assessing impacts on human systems as well as natural systems; (ii) quantifying the \neffects in social and economic terms; (iii) explicitly assessing adaptation options in terms of their \ncosts and benefits in reducing impacts; (iv) identifying most effective adaptation options, and \ndesigning action plans to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience; and  (v) identifying most \neffective mechanisms and modalities to mainstream adaptation programs into development \ndecision making and economic planning. \n \n9.  The AtRR approach recognizes the need for (i) capacity building and awareness to \nunderstand and undertake adaptation; (ii) development of tools for the assessment of risks and \nvulnerabilities; (iii) the undertaking of required assessments; (iv) mainstreaming adaptation into \ndevelopment  plans,  policies,  and  strategies  based  upon  the  assessments,  including  the \nprioritization  of  options;  and  (v)  implementing  the  adaptation  options  through  development \nplans, programs, and projects. Essentially, these are the building blocks toward a \u201cno-regrets\u201d \n                                                 \n4 As reported by the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Geneva. 2000 ", "    3 \napproach to climate adaptation. For a description of this approach, adaptation, risk, vulnerability, \nand other AtRR methods, see Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n10.  Providing  follow-up  support  to  encourage  adaptation  mainstreaming  is  another  key \nrequirement. This will specifically include (i) strengthened and improved development of national \ntechnical and institutional response mechanisms and structures for adaptation; (ii) social and \neconomic  evaluation  of  adaptation  options  and  related  technologies;  (iii)  development  of \nadaptation strategies, detailed action plans, and prioritization of options; (iv) concrete adoption \nof the adaptation policies and measures at the country level; and (v) implementation of the \nadaptation options with monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. \n \n11.  For the aid community, there is a symmetric need to incorporate AtRR into country \nstrategies  and  assistance  programs,  policy  support,  institutional  strengthening,  and  project \ndesigns. Considering the significance of external assistance in the development process of most \nPacific  countries,  efforts  made  in  this  direction  will  significantly  facilitate  the  adaptation \nmainstreaming process. \n \n12.  The TA is designed to address the impacts of future CCV by mainstreaming adaptation \ninto development policies and projects. The underlying premise of the program is that, in large \npart, the goals of adaptation can be achieved through reducing risks to climatic extremes, with \noutcomes that benefit present as well as future development. Mainstreaming adaptation through \nrisk  reduction  into  development  is  a  pathway  that  stimulates,  promotes,  and  facilitates \nsustainable development in a coherent and holistic manner.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n \n13.  The goal of the TA is to ensure that Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) adapt to CCV. The purpose of the TA is to mainstream \nAtRR, on a pilot basis, in development planning and management in selected PDMCs and ADB \noperations. The technical assistance framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n14.  TA outputs will include \n \n(i)  a  review  of  completed  and  ongoing  programs  on  climate  variability  and  risk \nmanagement, risk reduction, and climate change vulnerability and adaptation, with \nspecific regard to relevance, appropriateness, and applicability of AtRR; \n \n(ii) mainstreaming AtRR into ADB project operations to better respond to country needs; \nand \n \n(iii) at the country level, two PDMCs selected to undertake mainstreaming of AtRR on a \npilot  basis  at  the  national  development  planning,  sector  programs,  and  project \nactivities levels. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will be undertaken in two phases \u2013 an initial phase comprising a general level of \nactivities for 2 months, and a second phase comprising ADB level and country level activities for \n13 months, using full participatory approaches.  \n ", "4   \n16.  During the first phase, at the general level, the TA will undertake an analytical review of \npast and ongoing adaptation programs including lessons learned, gap analysis, identification of \nmost effective analytical tools and methodologies, capacity building programs and institutional \nsupport modalities. The key elements of adaptation processes will be analyzed to sharpen the \nfocus of TA implementation activities. The review will focus on how best ADB and country \n\u201cmainstreaming\u201d of adaptation can be undertaken. Identification and establishment of the TA in \nat least two participating countries will also be carried out during this first phase.  \n \n17.  During the second phase, two levels of mainstreaming activities, ADB and country level, \nwill be undertaken in parallel, based upon the outcomes of the review carried out during the first \nphase. \n \n18.  At the ADB level, key elements of the AtRR approach will be applied in selected ADB \noperations  with  the  primary  focus  on  mainstreaming  adaptation  in  ADB  processes  and \nprocedures.  The results from these activities will provide validation of the AtRR approach for \nmainstreaming purposes. In particular, the TA will (i) raise the awareness and understanding of \nADB staff concerning mainstreaming AtRR into ADB Pacific operations, (ii) prepare inputs and \nrecommendations for the country strategy and program/country strategy and program update \npreparation process to incorporate AtRR at the country strategy and program level,  (iii) identify \nprojects that can incorporate AtRR, (iv) identify and recommend steps toward incorporating \nAtRR into the project preparatory technical assistance preparation process, and (v) develop a \nset of guidelines for ADB use on incorporating AtRR into ADB operations.  \n \n19.  At the country level, the TA will undertake AtRR by applying the key elements of the \nAtRR approach in two PDMCs.  While assessment of climate risk and vulnerability at the \ncountry level will result in a range of adaptation options, these latter will be prioritized with their \ncosts  and  benefits  estimated  against  various  climate  change  scenarios.  The  focus  of  the \nactivities will be on mainstreaming the policy adaptation options selected out of the AtRR \nprocess into countries\u2019 development planning and decision-making. Activities will include (i) use \nof analytical tools for adaptation; (ii) preparation/refinement of assessments; (iii) quantification of \nthe socioeconomic effects from the assessments; (iv) prioritization of adaptation options to \nmaximize economic, social, and environmental benefits; and (v) mainstreaming of adaptation \ninto development plans, programs, and policies.  The TA will prepare at least one development \nplanning, sector policy, or institutional strengthening document that incorporates AtRR, and \nassess at least one non-ADB-funded project by incorporating AtRR.  In addition, the TA will \ndevelop a set of guidelines and a manual of instructions for mainstreaming AtRR, as well as \nprovide AtRR training of country officials. The results of these activities will provide validation of \nthe AtRR  approach for mainstreaming purposes at the country level. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent and will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change, funded by the Government \nof Canada. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The TA will be executed by ADB over an estimated 15-month period. It is expected to \ncommence in November 2002 and to be completed by January 2004.  \n \n22.  The ADB Pacific Department will implement the TA under the overall guidance of the \nRenewable  Energy,  Energy  Efficiency  and  Climate  Change    program  steering  committee. ", "    5 \nConsultations with regional organizations, PDMC stakeholders, and ADB staff will be facilitated \nby the initial consultations, one regional workshop, three national workshops, the presentation \nand discussions of TA progress, and key results at one or more internal ADB \u201cgreen bag\u201d \nseminars, and environment sector network meetings. All these activities will provide timely \ncontributions on the proposed mainstreaming approaches at both the ADB and country level.  \n \n23.  TA implementation will be undertaken in two phases:  Phase 1 will cover activities at the \ngeneral level and will last for 2 months.  Phase 2 will cover both ADB level and country level \nactivities  for  the  remaining  13  months.  Four  international  consultants  and  three  domestic \nconsultants will assist in TA implementation.  \n \n24.  All general level activities under phase 1 and ADB level activities under phase 2 will be \nundertaken  by  the  following,  recruited  as  individual  consultants:  (i)  one  adaptation \nmainstreaming specialist (international consultant, 9 person-months) with international climate \nchange  adaptation  management  experience,  and  (ii)  one  adaptation  research  assistant \n(domestic  consultant,  15  person-months)  with  experience  in  climate  change  policy  and \nenvironmental economics.  Phase 2 country level activities will be undertaken by the following, \nrecruited through a consulting firm: (i) one climate risk and vulnerability specialist (international, \n8 person-months) with experience in climate change assessments; (ii) one island coastal zone \nspecialist (international, 5 person-months) with experience in climate change, tropical coastal \nareas, and coral reef management; (iii) one Economist (international, 5 person-months) with \nclimate change economics experience; and (iv) two local climate change specialists (domestic, \ntotal  of  12  person-months)  with  experience  in  undertaking  vulnerability  and  adaptation \nassessments and recruited in each of the two selected PDMCs to assist TA implementation \nover a period of 6 months. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are \npresented  in  Appendix  3.  The  consulting  firm  selection  process  will  follow  the  simplified \ntechnical proposal and the quality and cost-based selection method. \n \n25.  At the country level, climate country teams have been established under PICCAP and \nbuilding upon this institutional arrangement is suggested, although strengthening the team with  \nstaff from central planning and/or finance ministries and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nmay be required. The two participating PDMCs will need to ensure that they have the highest \nlevels  of  support,  and  involve  civil  society,  the  main  NGOs,  the  private  sector  and  local \ncommunities. During TA implementation a national workshop for each country will be held to \nraise  the  awareness  and  understanding  of  key  stakeholder  groups  concerning  adaptation \nthrough  risk  reduction,  as  well  as  a  training  seminar  for  key  officials  on  undertaking \nassessments. Preliminary inception, midterm and final report outlines are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be financed by \nthe Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change on a grant basis for the purpose of the \nClimate Change Adaptation Program for the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
