During the Country Programming Mission in April 2003, the Government of Bhutan (the \nGovernment) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a technical assistance \n(TA) grant to augment its efforts in developing its national automated payment and settlement \nsystem.1  The request was in congruence with the Government\u2019s efforts to develop its private \nsector and with ADB's country development strategy for Bhutan. The TA is included in ADB's \nCountry Strategy and Program Update 2004\u20132006 for Bhutan.2  \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission visited Bhutan during 1\u201310 March 2004. The Mission met with \nrepresentatives  from  the  Department  of  Aid  and  Debt  Management  (DADM);  the  Royal \nMonetary Authority of Bhutan (RMA); and senior officials from the two commercial banks: Bank \nof Bhutan (BOB) and Bhutan National Bank (BNB), which are the primary facilitators of payment \nand settlement system in Bhutan. The Government and the Mission reached an understanding \non the  objectives, scope, financing plan, and implementation details of the TA. The project \nframework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  A national, secure, and efficient payment and settlement system  is essential for a \nrobust financial sector, where private sector operations may thrive. As part of its efforts to \ndevelop the private sector in Bhutan, the Government took the initiative to introduce a payment \nand  settlement  system  in  the  1990s.  Bhutan\u2019s  first  clearinghouse  was  established  in  the \nfinancial hub of Thimphu in January 1997. Thimphu clearinghouse was providing a service long \nneeded, and the amount of checks it cleared expanded rapidly. To facilitate the efficient \npayment and settlement of growing interbank transactions between BNB and BOB, another \nclearinghouse was opened in Phuentsholing in 2000. Both clearinghouses thrived. The number \nof checks and the amount of funds cleared per month in Thimphu increased from 99 checks and \nNu9.73 million ($212,167 equivalent) in January 1997 to 2,781 checks and Nu131.50 million \n($2,867,423 equivalent), respectively, by January 2003: an increase of 2,709% in the number of \nchecks and 1,252% in the amount being cleared. Similarly, the Phuentsholing clearinghouse \nhas processed more than 11,000 checks in 2003. At present, despite the high volume of \ntransactions  they  handle,  the  two  clearinghouses  fall  short  of  adequately  meeting  market \ndemand in Bhutan. \n \n4.  Phuentsholing and Thimphu clearinghouses are owned and managed by RMA. They \nprovide  services  to  the  two  commercial  banks  BNB  and  BOB.3 These  services  include \nprocessing local currency personal checks, banker\u2019s checks, drafts, cash warrants, and foreign \ncurrency checks payable in local currency drawn on one of the two banks. Each clearinghouse \nreports its net position to RMA daily. A semi-manual settlement method of clearing transactions \nand the DOS-based FoxPro computer program, developed by RMA in 1997, are still being used \nby the clearinghouses. However, this system is not able to accommodate the expanding volume \nof transactions.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 2 April 2004. \n2  ADB, August 2003, Country Strategy and Program Update: Bhutan 2004\u20132006, Manila \n3  BNB and BOB do not transact directly but go through the clearinghouses and RMA. Checks are thus cleared in \nabout 2 working days. \n ", "2  \n5.  Moreover, no national computerized network exists. This engenders a geographical \nexclusivity; only transactions undertaken in Phuentsholing and Thimphu are cleared, excluding \ntransactions  in  other  parts  of  the  country.  Operations  throughout  the  country  should be \nelectronically linked if an integrated national settlement system for Bhutan is to be established. \nFull automation of the payment and settlement system would assist in expeditious and efficient \nprocessing of claims. Financial transactions, hence the  trade sector in particular, would not \nsuffer  from  delays  due  to  manual  processing.  Conceivably,  development  of  automated \nelectronic banking instruments would enhance efficiency of domestic financial institutions and \nreduce  transaction  costs  of  payment  and  settlement.  Complete  information  on  these \ntransactions would be immediately available to monetary authorities, facilitating more informed \nmanagement of the monetary and financial systems. The increase in speed, security, and \ntransparency of financial transactions would lower risks associated with settlement. This could, \nin turn, stimulate mobilization of domestic deposits and deepening of the financial sector.  \n \n6.  Bhutan has no comprehensive legislative and regulatory framework for clearinghouses \nat present. Clearing operations, responsibilities of clearinghouses, liabilities and responsibilities \nof clearing participants, and the guidelines for interaction among clearinghouses and other \nfinancial institutions have been prescribed by the Clearinghouse Rules and Regulations (1996). \nThese rules and regulations have been supplemented by the Negotiable Instruments Act (NIA) \nof 2000, which pertains to promissory notes, bills of exchange, and checks. The regulatory \nframework will have to be reviewed and amended to accommodate a national automated \npayment and settlement system. \n \n7.  The current payment and settlement system has structural, institutional, and capacity \nconstraints. To address these constraints, RMA formed the Working Group for Payment and \nSettlement System. The group is chaired by the managing director of RMA, and comprises \nsenior officials from RMA and commercial banks. The group is tasked with guiding the design \nand development of a modern, robust payment and settlement system in Bhutan consistent with \nthe best international practices. In close communication with the Reserve Bank of India, Bangko \nSentral ng Pilipinas, and clearinghouses in India and the Philippines, the group has deliberated \non payment instruments, electronic banking systems, clearing and settlement arrangements, \nand regulatory and technological infrastructure that may be necessary to establish an integrated \npayment system in Bhutan. \n \n8.  In April 2004, five members of the group visited Manila and Mumbai to learn from their \ncounterparts' experience about how a modern clearinghouse may be established. They met with \ntechnical staff and senior officials from the Department of Information and Technology and \nNational Clearing Cell of the Reserve Bank of India, the high value Clearinghouse in Mumbai, \nand the Philippine Clearinghouse Corporation.  \n \n9.  Central to the discussions were the current clearing system in Bhutan and means of \nimproving its scope and efficiency through computerization of clearing transactions. For the \ngroup to make an informed decision on which automated and computerized system may be \nused in Bhutan, they compared and contrasted types and volume of transactions, number of \nclearing participants, equipment, and software needed to carry out payment and settlement \nactivities in Bhutan, India, and the Philippines. In addition to the structural and legal modalities \nto be considered while strengthening the payment and settlement system in Bhutan, the group \nconcluded magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) or imaging might be used to modernize \nthe existing clearing mechanism.  \n ", "  3\n10.  MICR is a character recognition4 and analysis system using special ink and characters \nthat  can  be  magnetized  and  read  automatically.  MICR  is  used  extensively  in  the banking \nindustry  to  print  details  on  checks  (making  it  difficult  to  forge  the  checks),  and  enable \nexpeditious and automatic processing by computer systems.5  MICR clearing involves sorting, \nlisting, and generating interbank claims. There are two commonly used MICR fonts: E-13B and \nCMC-7. E-13B is the first font used in automated banking in the 1950s, when automatic reading \nof information became important with automatic processing of checks at other than the native \nbanks. It contains the digits and four special symbols used in banking. The font was specially \ndesigned so that magnetic pulses would be read unambiguously. The CMC-7 font was designed \nin France to encode more than simply the digits and some special symbols. It encodes the \ndigits, the letters, and five special symbols; it can also be seen as a bar code. \n \n11.  \"Remote  check  imaging,\"  on  the  other  hand,  is  the  imaging  of  a  check  (via \nelectronically scanning) at a bank site other than the site where the image system and database \nreside. Images of checks are stored electronically until they are automatically retrieved for \nstatement preparation. Customers receive an image statement, which includes a specially \ndesigned first page, and features images of canceled checks, rather than the actual checks. \nDirectly beneath each check image, the posting date, check number, amount, and trace number \nmay be listed. Imaging also improves response to customer inquiries, and check verification, \nand makes production of customer statements and notices more efficient. Images of checks, \ndeposit tickets, and statements are archived on optical disk storage and retrievable through a \ncomputer network. Users can access, print, or fax check images and statements.  \n \n12.  MICR is used for clearing large numbers of  checks for numerous banks in a short \nperiod of time. Even low capacity machines are able to handle about 300 checks per minute, \nwhile faster technology is available and used in sophisticated financial sectors. Imaging is the \nnext generation of technology used in automated payment and settlement systems. However, \ntelecommunication bandwidths, image data compression efficiency, and compatibility are key \ncomponents of using this method for check clearing. For it to be adopted in Bhutan, information \ninfrastructure  would  have  to  be  adequate.  Moreover,  considerable  amendments  to  the \nlegislation pertaining to information and communication technology and NIA would have to be \nmade. For instance, the NIA requires that checks be physically presented for clearing. If this \nrequirement were maintained, imaging would not necessarily expedite check clearing across \nBhutan\u2019s geographically challenging terrain.  \n \n13.  The group translated the technical knowledge gathered during the study tour into \ninformed guidance for improving the current payment and settlement system in Bhutan.  The \ngroup shared its findings from the study tour with the chief executives of BNB, BOB, and RMA \non 28 April 2004. The chief executives deliberated available options and possible modalities of \npursuing each option identified during the study tour.  However, this knowledge needs to be \nfurther contextualized for Bhutan, given its immediate and medium-term needs: institutional, \nstructural, and legal adaptability. Once a clear decision is made as to how the payment and \nsettlement  system  could  best  be  automated,  then  operational  and  regulatory  guidelines, \nappropriate computer software, adequate hardware, and trained technical staff will be required \nto successfully upgrade the payment and settlement system. \n \n                                                 \n4  Character recognition fonts are divided in two groups, MICR and optical character recognition (OCR). However, the \ndistinction is somewhat artificial, as some applications use magnetizable ink for OCR, while the MICR fonts can be \nrecognized optically.  \n5  Similarly in computing, MICR is a technique that enables special characters printed in magnetic ink to be read and \ninputted rapidly to a computer. ", "4  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The objective of this TA is to establish an integrated payment and settlement system \nthroughout Bhutan. Legal modalities, institutional arrangements, and current practices will be \nreviewed, with a view to designing a comprehensive, computerized payment and settlement \nsystem.  The  system  will  address  the  needs  of  banks,  businesses  and  individuals  in  a \nsustainable, efficient, transparent manner, thereby promoting financial market and private sector \ndevelopment. The TA will explore the possibility of graduating from the current manual system \nof recording, payment, and settlement to a more sophisticated processing system, e.g., a \nsystem using MICR technology, imaging, or a \u201creal time\u201d gross settlement system, eventually. \nThe TA will support the institutional and regulatory development of this system, as well as \nimplementing the system by procuring necessary equipment and computer software. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  This TA will primarily support (i) reviewing and revising, as needed, the Clearinghouse \nRules and Regulations (1996) to accommodate an integrated clearing and settlement system; \n(ii) reviewing the present responsibilities and tasks of the clearinghouses; (iii) defining a general \nframework to link all the clearinghouses and expand their coverage to the entire country; (iv) \ndrafting the rules and procedures to create the necessary legal framework within which the \nclearinghouses would operate; (v) identifying, procuring, and installing software and hardware \nfor the integrated automated clearing system, to enable efficient operation of a check clearing \nand settlement system; (vi) implementing the system; and (vii) ensuring its sustainability by \ntraining staff from BNB, BOB, and RMA on how to use and maintain the system. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $330,000 equivalent, comprising $272,000 in \nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $58,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  finance \n$275,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign currency costs and $3,000 in local \ncurrency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The \nGovernment will contribute the remaining $55,000 equivalent of local currency costs in kind as \noffice space and facilities, counterpart staff, local transportation, and administrative and clerical \nsupport. ADB's financing will be used for (i) acquiring the services of an international consultant, \n(ii)  organizing  workshops  and  providing  training  as  required  to  counterpart  staff,  and  (iii) \nacquiring the equipment and software required to implement the new payment and settlement \nsystem. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  DADM, Ministry of Finance, will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and RMA will be \nthe Implementing Agency. The TA will be implemented over 1 year, between November 2004\u2013\nNovember 2005. Two counterpart staff will be nominated from DADM, and will work closely with \nthe TA consultant to facilitate effective and efficient TA implementation.  \n \n18.  An individual international consultant will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, to provide the required consulting services for a total of 3 \nperson-months,  delivered  intermittently.  The  consultant  will  be  a  central  bank  financial \nspecialist,  with  extensive  operations  experience  in  payment  and  settlement  systems.  The ", "  5\nconsultant will assess of the current institutional, legal, and procedural facets of the check \nclearing and settlement mechanism in Bhutan, and identify how to improve it. The consultant will \nthen prepare a framework to consolidate and improve the currently disjointed settlement system \nin a  payment systems vision paper and draft the necessary rules and regulations to ensure \nsustainability of a national check clearing system in Bhutan. The consultant will also assist RMA \nstaff, who have the expertise in information technology and system requirements to implement \nan  automated  payment  and  settlement  system,  in  identifying  the  necessary  software  and \nhardware to support this system. Outline terms of reference for the consultant are provided in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n19.  In implementing the new system, additional computer software and hardware will be \nneeded. The consultant will identify the software and hardware necessary to support the new \nclearing system. Equipment, computer hardware and software will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. After the completion of the TA, all equipment purchased \nunder the TA will be turned over to the Government. \n \n20.  The consultant will prepare (i) an inception report within 15 days of fielding; (ii) a \nmidterm review report after the second month of consultancy; (iii) a draft final report for the TA, \nto be submitted 2 weeks before the end of the consulting term; and (iv) a final report at the end \nof the consulting term. All reports will be submitted (in hard and soft copies) to DADM, RMA, \nand ADB for review and comments. The consultant will incorporate the comments received from \nthe Government and ADB while finalizing the reports. The recommendations of the final report \nwill be discussed during a tripartite meeting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $275,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for Strengthening of the Payment and Settlement System, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.
