INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  enabling \nenvironment for infrastructure financing in Pakistan through capacity development and research \nand policy advice on supporting the legal and institutional framework for infrastructure financing \nand public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).  \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Pakistan.1 TA outputs will also support policy lending reforms for \nprogram loans in public financial management.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.   Economic growth in Pakistan has been hampered by the lack of investments in critical \nand quality public infrastructure. Public investment in infrastructure is well below the estimated \nannual investment requirement of 7.6%of gross domestic product, which was estimated at $20.6 \n \nbillion in 2015.3This has resulted in inefficiencies across key infrastructure sectors, including \n \ndelays in the transport of goods and limited access to energy and potable water, which affect not \nonly the welfare of the public but also the country\u2019s overall industrial and economic growth. \n \n4.  Private sector participation through PPPs would enhance resource mobilization for public \ninfrastructure development and create a sustainable source of financing with positive impacts on \ngrowth, jobs, and poverty reduction. Private infrastructure financing bridges the financing gap and \nassists in alleviating poverty through the additional jobs created by such investments. Majority \nprivate sector participation in the financing of public infrastructure projects introduces commercial \ndiscipline in allocating and pricing project risks. The success of the PPP modality relies on the \npresence of sound legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks and effective capacity building \nto identify, evaluate, and prepare a robust pipeline of potential PPP transactions. \n \n5.  The  federal  government  has  initiated  several  reforms  encompassing  the  PPP  legal \nframework at the federal level, such as the Public Private Partnership Authority Act, 2017, and \nproposed the creation of a viability gap fund (VGF). It has also attempted to make operational a \ngovernment institution that will assist in the financing of key infrastructure and PPP projects \nthrough the Pakistan Development Fund Limited (PDFL).4 The framework is at a nascent stage, \nhowever, and there is a growing need for a careful analysis of the gaps in the existing PPP \nframework to ensure effective institutional, regulatory, and financial mechanisms. Most provinces \nhave a PPP legal and institutional framework in place, and Sindh and Punjab have closed a \nnumber of projects under the established framework. However, the federal PPP framework is yet \nto be implemented.  ADB is currently implementing a project in Sindh, and processing another \nproject in Punjab for enhancing PPPs in the provinces, and will use the lessons learnt from these \nprojects in implementing the TA.5 \n \n6.  The government\u2019s inefficient public debt management also contributes negatively to the \nproject lending practices of local commercial banks. Different development partners, especially \nthe International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the United States Agency for International \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 Dec 2017. \n3  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n4  The Ministry of Finance, Revenue, and Economic Affairs (MOF) established the PDFL as a nonbanking financial \ninstitution in 2006. The PDFL is currently a shell company and not yet operational. \n5 PAK 46538-002 (Supporting PPP Investments in Sindh) and PAK 49128-002 (Enhancing PPPs in Punjab) \n ", "2 \nDevelopment, have previously attempted to bring meaningful reforms to the overall public debt \nmanagement function, but progress has been limited. The government\u2019s strong preference to \nborrow from the local banking system to address fiscal deficits has resulted in local commercial \nbanks holding about 70% of the banks\u2019 assets in medium-term government-issued securities.6 \nThis in turn creates inefficiencies as it limits local bank capacity to invest in other assets by way \nof  lending  to  infrastructure  projects.  Moreover,  debt  capital  markets  are  shallow  and \nunderdeveloped, with insignificant participation from retail investors in government-issued debt \ninstruments. Fund mobilization from retail investors is therefore important. Additionally, the role \nand framework of the Central Directorate of National Savings (with a portfolio of more than $32 \nbillion) may also be explored in the development of capital markets. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: informed decision making by the government \non reforms to increase infrastructure investments in the country, consistent with the Infrastructure \nFinance Policy Pakistan 2017 and the long-term strategy under the Pakistan 2025: One Nation, \nOne Vision road map.7 The road map sets the foundation to fast-track Pakistan\u2019s development to \nbecome an upper middle-income economy by 2025 and one of the top 10 economies in the world \nby 2047. It is anchored on seven pillars that include addressing the country\u2019s infrastructure deficit \nand increasing private sector engagement in the provision of key infrastructure and services \nthrough PPPs. \n \n8.  The TA will have the following outcome: potential reforms to address the gaps in the \nexisting framework that constrain infrastructure financing accepted.8 \n \n9.  The TA will address the core problems of limited private sector investment in infrastructure \nby  looking  at  the  following  key  causes:  (i)  inadequate  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nframeworks for PPP investments; (ii) lack of a government financial support mechanism;9 (iii) \nweak government agency to identify, structure, and finance PPP projects;10 (iv) limited capacity \nof and coordination among government agencies;11 and (v) underdeveloped and shallow debt \ncapital markets.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Support to develop institutional, legal, and regulatory frameworks for \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  provided. Overall,  the TA  will  complete  a situation  and gap \nanalysis of constraints posed by the existing frameworks for the origination and structuring of PPP \ntransactions. This will include a review of the existing institutional and legal frameworks for the \norigination, structuring, and financing of PPPs to identify gaps, including in the PPP Authority Act. \nThe TA will also provide recommendations and support (i) implementation of possible reforms in \n                                                \n6  S.

Moreover, the TA will support the development of an operational framework \nfor a federal project development facility (PDF) and the VGF, which will include PDF and VGF \nusage rules and guidelines. The PDF will support the use of transaction advisory services and \nthe VGF will be used for the public financing portion of PPPs. The TA may also provide \nrecommendations and support the implementation of possible reforms in sectors that are well \nsuited for mobilizing private sector investments, including sector regulation and enforcement \nmechanisms, and the development of a detailed deal pipeline for potential PPP projects. \n \n11.  Output 2: Issues for operationalization of the Pakistan Development Fund Limited \ndetermined  and  support  to  operationalize  the  Pakistan  Development  Fund  Limited \nprovided. The TA will facilitate making the PDFL operational with the finalization of its business \nplan, governance structure, product suite, operations, risk, audit, financial management, and \nhuman resources manuals. The TA will also support the development of a detailed deal pipeline \nfor potential PPP projects.  \n \n12.  Output 3: Infrastructure finance and public\u2013private partnership capacity of the \nFinance  Division,  the  Planning  Commission,  and  key  line  ministries  enhanced. \nInfrastructure finance and PPP capacity will be enhanced in the Finance Division, the Planning \nCommission, and key line ministries. The capacity building will also use ADB-supported tools that \ndetail all relevant aspects of creating and implementing efficient and sustainable PPPs, such as \nthe APMG PPP Certification Program Guide.13 The TA will support the creation of a PPP advisory \ncommittee with cross-ministerial representation from the Finance Division, Planning Commission, \nkey line ministries, and provincial PPP units to help address any lack of coordination among \ngovernment agencies, and have a forum for regular interface between federal and provincial units \non frameworks and policies related to infrastructure development and PPPs. \n \n13.  Output 4: Potential reform areas for the development of long-term debt capital \nmarkets  identified.  The  TA  will  provide  support  for  a  diagnostic  review  of  and  reform \nrecommendations for the institutional and legal framework of capital markets development and \npublic debt management, including the role and framework of the Central Directorate of National \nSavings and mobilization of retail investors. Building on the work of other multilaterals, this TA will \nalso support a study on the impact of inefficient debt management on infrastructure financing and \ncapital markets development for mobilizing private sector financing. The coverage of these \noutputs will be at the federal level. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,629,117, of which $3,266,205 (equivalent to \u00a32,452,290)14 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom15 and administered \nby ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The Government of Pakistan will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, data and information, assistance in \n                                                \n13 The APMG PPP Certification Program is an innovation of ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the Multilateral Investment \nFund, and the World Bank Group. It is partly funded by the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility and has a \nshared vision of enhancing PPP performance globally. https://ppp-certification.com \n14 Exchange rate as of 28 November 2017.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will delegate administration of the TA to the Ministry of Finance, Revenue, and \nEconomic  Affairs  (MOF),  which  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  MOF  will  also  be  the \nimplementation agency for all outputs, along with the Infrastructure Project Development Facility \n(which is being merged into the PPP Authority) for output 1; the PDFL for output 2; the Ministry of \nPlanning, Development and Reform for output 3; and the Securities and Exchange Commission \nof Pakistan for output 4. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2020  \nExecuting agency  MOF \nImplementing agencies  Output 1: MOF and IPDF or PPP Authority \nOutput 2: MOF and PDFL \nOutput 3: MOF and Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform \nOutput 4: MOF and SECP \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual: individual  International  $$501,800 \nselection  expertise (20 \nperson-months) \n  Individual: individual  National expertise  $867,405 \nselection   (101 person-\nmonths) \n  Consulting firm  Consulting firm (48  $800,000 \n(two international  person-months) \nand eight national \nconsultants): \nquality-based \nselection \n  Resource persons  To be determined  $175,000 \nProcurement  Not applicable \nDisbursement  The TA will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank; IPDF = Infrastructure Project Development Facility; MOF = Ministry of Finance, \nRevenue, and Economic Affairs; QBS = quality-based selection; SECP = Securities and Exchange Commission of \nPakistan; PPP = public\u2013private partnership; TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.  Consulting  services.  ADB  will  provide  169  person-months  of  individual  consulting \nservices through two sets of consultants that will be recruited separately: (i) six international \nconsultants and 14 national consultants as individuals for 121 person-months, and (ii) two \ninternational and eight national consultants through a consulting firm for 48 person-months. ADB \nwill engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.16 \n                                                \n16 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \n \n18.  ADB will engage a consulting firm through quality-based selection for making the PDFL \noperational because the downstream impact is so large that the quality of the services is of \noverriding importance for the outcome of the TA. The PDFL is envisaged to be a key infrastructure \nfinancing institution owned by the government which will not only play an instrumental role in \nmobilizing investments to increase private sector engagement and participation but will also help \nthe  government  address  market  failures  and  support  PPPs  and  infrastructure  projects  in \nchallenging sectors. It is therefore important that the constitutive documents, strategy, systems, \nand policies are developed in line with international best practices. \n \n19.  In addition to the consultants, the TA will engage resource persons to provide relevant \ninternational or national perspectives, bring up-to-date knowledge, and participate in and present \nat the workshops, seminars, or conferences. The resource persons will include an editor to refine \nthe reports and research assistants to help the consultants conduct surveys and other tasks. The \nnumber of resource persons and the person-months will be determined during TA implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  administering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$3,266,205 (equivalent to \u00a32,452,290)17 to the Government of Pakistan to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of the United Kingdom for Strengthening the Federal Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Framework and Enabling Reforms for Infrastructure Financing Support, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n17 Exchange rate as of 28 November 2017.
