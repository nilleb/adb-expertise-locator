The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will serve as a facility for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to respond expeditiously and efficiently to support the knowledge needs \nof Asia and the Pacific region (particularly East Asia) by developing strategic knowledge products \nfocusing on policy development and policy advisory support.1 Knowledge and advisory products \nwill be developed in core sectors where ADB has lending operations and other essential areas \nwhere there is a demand and/or potential for ADB strategic policy assistance, and where ADB \nexhibits a comparative advantage. The policy development work under the TA may serve as \ninputs to overall policymaking and coordination, project development, sector development, and \nregional cooperation in issues and sectors consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies \n(CPSs) for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Mongolia, especially those that align with \nthe Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., Sustainable Development Goal 17: \u201cRevitalize the \nglobal partnership for sustainable development\u201d). \n \n2.  The TA examines regional issues in core sectors in the PRC and Mongolia that align with \nthe priorities identified in the CPSs for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 and Mongolia, 2017\u20132020. \u201cFostering \nknowledge cooperation\u201d and \u201csupporting institutional and governance reform\u201d are ADB\u2019s strategic \npriorities in supporting the reform agenda of the Government of the PRC.2 By recognizing \nknowledge solutions as powerful catalysts for propelling development in the PRC and enhancing \nthis effect, ADB continues to support a more sustainable trajectory for the PRC\u2019s economy \nthrough knowledge-based solutions. The TA also aligns with ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan for the PRC, 2017\u20132019, which encourages greater synergies between the lending program, \nTA program, and knowledge work to maximize the development impact of ADB initiatives in the \nPRC.3  \n \n3.  On the other hand, the CPS for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020 supports investments, policy \nreforms, capacity building, and knowledge sharing to sustain inclusive growth in periods of \neconomic difficulty.4  To achieve this, ADB hinges its operations on three strategic pillars: (i) \npromoting economic and social stability, (ii) developing infrastructure for economic diversification, \nand  (iii)  strengthening  environmental  sustainability.  The  CPS  for  Mongolia  also  identifies \nknowledge and innovation as a cross-cutting theme, with knowledge as an integral part of ADB \noperations and innovations in projects and business procedures. ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness  plan  for  Mongolia,  2017\u20132019  likewise  reiterates  the  importance  of  knowledge \noperations on issues that relate to these three strategic pillars and cross-cutting themes.5  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Policy  research  remains  important  for  both  the  Government  of  the  PRC  and  the \nGovernment of Mongolia. In the PRC, policy research is recognized as a priority requiring (i) a \nbetter appreciation of lessons from the experience of developed economies and other middle-\nincome developing member countries (DMCs), and (ii) a deeper understanding of the constraints \nand conditions unique to the PRC. In Mongolia, the need for a forum in which government and \nnongovernment research institutes can discuss development constraints is evident. A deeper \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 November 2017.  \n2 ADB. 2016.

Manila.  \n \n ", "2 \nappreciation of applied research methodologies could strengthen these institutes\u2019 contribution to \npolicy analysis, which is in high demand.  \n \n5.  Recognizing these knowledge needs, ADB approved regional TA (RETA) 6428 on 12 \nDecember 2007.6 Since then, this TA has served as a facility for ADB to respond quickly to \nrequests from Mongolia and the PRC for knowledge products and services (KPS). The regional \nTA helped inform decisionmakers proactively on emerging strategic policy issues and disseminate \nresearch findings and knowledge more widely.7 The PRC\u2019s Ministry of Finance was particularly \nsatisfied with the implementation of the requested core KPS, and expressed appreciation to ADB \nduring  the  country  programming  missions  and  ADB  knowledge  management  missions. \nMongolia\u2019s Ministry of Finance also expressed its satisfaction with the policy research and the \nlogistical support given to capacity-building projects. They noted that policymakers in the Office \nof the President and the Office of the Prime Minister were using KPS outputs. \n \n6.  While the regional TA was implemented well in general, and the majority of the KPS \nsubprojects were rated satisfactory, its potential has not been fully taken advantage of. Lessons \nfrom the earlier knowledge-oriented facility-type TA indicate the need for more systematic logistics \nsupport in knowledge production to (i) coordinate and communicate better both internally and \nexternally to ensure the quality of knowledge products, (ii) focus on value added and impacts, and \n(iii) disseminate knowledge effectively as it is generated.8  \n \n7.  The PRC and Mongolia will need continued support for policy response from lessons \nlearned in other economies. Knowledge production, discussion, and dissemination involving \nrelevant sector experts from academia, governments, and policy institutions will cross-fertilize \nideas across groups and disciplines, and help disseminate outcomes to broader audiences.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: effective economic policies, investment \ndecisions, and project design in ADB\u2019s DMCs increased. The TA will have the following outcome: \nthe quality of policy advisory and coordination in the PRC and Mongolia improved.9  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n \n9.  Output 1: Strategic, high-quality policy studies and publications on key regional \ndevelopment issues produced. The TA will produce knowledge products to formulate effective \npolicy options and disseminate these in various forms to maximize the impacts of the knowledge \nproducts. At least five strategic policy studies on key  regional development issues will be \npublished, and one regional workshop will be held. The TA will encourage close consultation with \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Supporting Strategic Knowledge Products and Research Networking. Manila.  \n7 The TA completed seven knowledge products. Three more products are being processed, and will be published in \n2017. In addition, the TA financed various reports and logistic services, such as the translation, typesetting, and \nprinting of various knowledge products.  \n8 ADB. 2013. People\u2019s Republic of China: Facility-Type Technical Assistance. Manila. This study notes that \u201cintroducing \nfacility-type TA in middle-income country contexts increases goodwill for the wider ADB country portfolio. In the PRC, \nthe view of knowledge as a product, and the consciousness of the costs embedded in knowledge production, enhance \nthe prospects for the further development. ADB should consider formalizing a discussion on knowledge products and \nservices strategy in the annual country programming review exercises.\u201d  \n9 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nthe governments of the PRC and Mongolia, as well as other stakeholders in ADB\u2019s DMCs, and \nwill  be  flexible  in  selecting  topics  for  policy  development  and  advisory  work  during  TA \nimplementation. The criteria for considering KPS proposals will include (i) a sound understanding \nof existing knowledge in the area, ideally supported by actual achievement in the field; (ii) \nfeasibility analyses of data and material availability; (iii) clear ideas of expected impacts and \ndissemination  activities;  and  (iv)  assurance  that  the  proposed  topic  is  relevant  and  has \nimplications in more than one country in the region.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Awareness of the findings of policy studies enhanced and disseminated. \nCompleted KPS will be uploaded to the ADB website, and launched and disseminated through \nADB events, high-level strategic policy dialogues, and conferences, in both English and local \nlanguages. The primary mode of dissemination is digital publication, although printed publications \ncan also be used for targeted audiences (workshop participants, stakeholders with limited internet \naccess, and as requested by the governments for inputs for consultations with stakeholders and \npolicy inputs). The specific number of printed publications will be determined on a case-to-case \nbasis. The TA will (i) build research capacity and knowledge base on issues relevant to Mongolia \nand the PRC by organizing learning forums with frontier experts; and (ii) will provide logistics \nsupport for high-level, knowledge-sharing events that facilitate strategic discussions of regional \nissues and policy matters facing the PRC and Mongolia, including these issues\u2019 impact on \nneighboring countries. These high-level strategic discussions will disseminate the KPS findings \nto targeted stakeholders, with the aim of contributing to policy discussions on emerging and \nimportant  issues  in  Mongolia  and  the  PRC.  The  TA  will  also  provide  logistics  support  to \ndepartmental knowledge products such as the East Asia Department Working Paper Series, \nObservations and Suggestions Policy Briefing Note series, and Quarterly Dialogue and Update. \nThe TA will also work with ADB\u2019s Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative program in the PRC by \ndisseminating the publications and organizing the high-level discussions.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $625,000, of which $500,000 will be financed by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, policy \ndocuments  and  guidelines,  statistical  data,  information,  office  space,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA. The East Asia Department, Office of the Director General will \nselect, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize meetings; and provide staff to act as \nresource persons in the meetings. In consultation with the governments, the office, as executing \nand implementing agency, will review the proposed KPS initiatives, select KPS topics, advise on \npolicy issues and research requirements, and help identify prominent scholars to carry out \nresearch in close consultation with experts from ADB\u2019s relevant departments. \n \n13.  A working group will be established for each subproject consisting of experts from both \nADB  and  relevant  external  institutions. The  working group members  will  prepare  research \nproducts, peer review to ensure quality of the product, and disseminate the publications. The East \nAsia Department sector divisions will be consulted on the composition of the working group and \nidentification of KPS topics. \n \n ", "4 \n14.  Consulting services. As the TA will be designed to respond and support the knowledge \nneeds of the PRC and Mongolia flexibly over a 5-year period (January 2018\u2013December 2022), \nconsulting services will be determined on a case-by-case basis for each activity.10 All consultants \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and the associated project administration and TA staff instructions.11 Resource persons may \nbe  engaged  to  act  as  speakers  and  reviewers  in  conferences,  workshops,  and  seminars. \nProposals that provide honoraria to experts for KPS activities will use a competitive selection \nprocess acceptable to ADB whereby at least three individuals are evaluated according to their \neducational background and relevant experience.
