INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bangladesh asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) to strengthen monitoring and enforcement of Meghna \nRiver\u2019s water quality for Dhaka\u2019s sustainable water supply. ADB included the TA in the 2014 \nprogram of the country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for Bangladesh.1  \n \n2.  The ADB fact-finding mission during 18\u201321 August 2014 reached an understanding with \nthe  government  on  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost, \nfinancing  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.2 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES  \n3.  Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) provides water across a service \narea of about 400 square kilometers in Dhaka City and its surroundings. It has been relying \nheavily on groundwater as a source of water supply, but current groundwater abstraction is \nbeyond sustainable yields, as evidenced by a rapidly falling water table.3 This and DWASA\u2019s \nplan to further expand its service area to cater to a growing population make it essential to \nincrease the surface water supply. However, the water quality in rivers surrounding Dhaka, such \nas Buriganga and Sitalakhya rivers, is rapidly deteriorating and the quantity is not adequate. \nMeghna River, about 30 kilometers east of Dhaka, has been identified as one of the major new \nsources of water supply for Dhaka.4 Two water intake points have been proposed, and the ADB-\nfinanced  Dhaka  Environmentally  Sustainable  Water  Supply  Project,  approved  in  2013,  is \nsupporting development of one intake point along with a raw water transmission pipeline and a \nwater treatment plant.5 Once these two water intake points and associated infrastructure are \ndeveloped, Meghna River will account for more than 40% of the raw water for DWASA\u2019s water \nsupply by 2021. To avoid deterioration of water quality and ensure sustainable water supply to \nDhaka, it is critical to strengthen the monitoring and enforcement mechanism for Meghna River.  \n \n4.  However, DWASA does not have the authority to regulate pollution in water bodies. It is \nthe Department of Environment (DOE) under the Ministry of Environment and Forests that is \nmandated by the government to monitor and control water, air, and soil pollution, and enforce \nthe Environment Conservation Act, 1995 (amended in 2010) if any violation by industries or \nothers occurs. Therefore, the monitoring and enforcement mechanism needs to place DOE at \nthe core of the arrangement. Although DOE is the sole authority for issuing and renewing \nenvironmental clearances for potentially polluting activities, it does not have enough staff to \nregularly monitor such activities and enforce necessary actions, such as ordering suspension of \nfactory operations or imposing fines. Furthermore, enforcing compliance measures is highly \npolitically sensitive, resulting in limited actions  against violators. While the water quality of \nMeghna River at the proposed intake sites is generally very good as of 2014, occasional reports \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2015\u20132017. Manila. The TA was originally titled \n\u201cEstablishing a Regulatory/Monitoring Mechanism for Meghna River Basin.\u201d   \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 September 2014. \n3  Dependence on groundwater is about 80% in 2014. \n4  Meghna River is a major watercourse of the Padma (or Ganges) River delta in Bangladesh. The name is properly \napplied to a channel of the Old Brahmaputra downstream of Bhairab Bazar, after it has received Surma River. \nMeghna  River  receives  the combined  waters  of  the  Padma  and  Jamuna  rivers  near  Chandpur.  After  264 \nkilometers, it enters the Bay of Bengal. \n5  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and \nAdministration of Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Dhaka Environmentally Sustainable Water \nSupply Project. Manila (Loan 3051-BAN). The other intake point at Haria, about 5 kilometers downstream, is \nproposed for the expanded Saidabad water treatment plant.  \n ", "2 \nof pollution in the river have emerged, and industries along the river have begun to increase. \nGiven rapid urbanization and increasing industrialization in Dhaka and its surrounding areas, the \nmonitoring and enforcement mechanism to maintain the good quality of Meghna River water \nneeds major strengthening. This requires (i) boosting the capacity of DOE; (ii) establishing a \nmore  collaborative,  innovative,  and  enforceable  system  by  involving  all  key  stakeholders, \nincluding the industries themselves; and (iii) raising public awareness of the importance of \nmaintaining the quality of water bodies such as Meghna River.   \n \n5.  The Environment Conservation Act has a provision whereby areas whose ecosystem is \nconsidered likely to reach a critical state will be declared as ecologically critical areas (ECAs) by \ngovernment notification. The notification will specify which operations or processes cannot be \ninitiated or continued in the ECAs. In addition to the initial seven wetland areas declared as \nECAs in 1999, the government, in 2009, declared the four rivers surrounding Dhaka\u2014Balu, \nBuriganga, Sitalakhya, and Turag\u2014as ECAs and started to strengthen actions to mitigate water \npollution. History clearly demonstrates that pollution prevention\u2014by regulating and controlling \nindustrial  development and  other  pollution-prone  activities\u2014is  essential  and far  more  cost-\neffective than cleaning up polluted water bodies. Therefore, the TA will look into improvements \nof the policy and regulatory requirements to protect the water quality of Meghna River, such as \ndeclaring a section of the river that is critical to maintaining the water quality of the proposed \nintakes as an ECA and/or amending or developing relevant regulations, standards, or policies. \n  \n6.  Excessive  water  abstraction from the river  could  have  significant  impacts  on  water \nsupply to Dhaka. Although the Water Act of 2013 is intended to control this issue, the issuance \nof rules and regulations under the act is still pending, leading to unregulated water abstraction. \nSince the volume of water supply from Meghna River to Dhaka is expected to be a small \nfraction of the river flow, estimated at less than 1% of the lean flow in 2021, the focus of the TA \nwill be to maintain water quality. Maintaining good water quality will not only benefit Dhaka\u2019s \npopulation in general, but also a large number of people whose livelihood fully or partially \ndepends on Meghna River, such as fishers and farmers, including the poor.   \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be that sustainable water supply from Meghna River to Dhaka City is \nensured. The outcome will be that government capacity for monitoring the water quality of \nMeghna River and enforcing laws to maintain it is strengthened. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Output 1: Monitoring and reporting system, including water pollution mapping, \nstrengthened in the relevant section of Meghna River. This output will help develop water \npollution mapping and strengthen the monitoring and reporting system to control the water \nquality of Meghna River, particularly in the relevant section of the proposed intake sites\u2014at \nBishnondi and Haria\u2014that serve as source of water supply.6 Tasks for water pollution mapping \ninclude (i) baseline surveys to identify existing pollution sources upstream and downstream of \nthe proposed intake sites, (ii) collection and analysis of development plans of the public and \n                                                \n6 The relevant section will be upstream and downstream of the proposed intake sites, with measurable impacts on the \nwater quality at the intake sites and will be determined through detailed assessments under the TA. Tidal effects \nrequire consideration of downstream impacts as well. ", "3 \nprivate  sectors  that  are  relevant  to  Meghna  River\u2019s  water  quality  and  volume,  and \n(iii) development of a map based on a geographic information system that includes information \non the pollution sources and their extent. As DOE is now developing its geographic information \nsystem, the survey findings will be merged with it. The database on pollution sources and loads \nwill be updated throughout TA implementation. Then the level of pollution impacts will be \nassessed by (i) reviewing the historical trend of water quality and quantity in and around the two \nintake sites, (ii) assessing the foreseeable pollution impacts and water quality projections that \narise from development of upstream and downstream areas, and (iii) determining the allowable \npollutant loads and level of pollution control needed to maintain high quality and adequate \nquantity of water from the intake points with a reasonable safety margin. Other tasks under this \noutput include (i) an analysis of the existing policy and regulatory framework, and identification \nof requirements to strengthen pollution control and enforcement (this may involve development \nof  a  new  policy,  revision  of  effluent  standards,  and  establishment  of  one  or  more  new \npermanent committees with clear mandates and functions); (ii) formulation of an environmental \nmonitoring  plan  with  clear  roles  and  responsibilities  for  all  agencies  concerned;  and  (iii) \nestablishment of a reporting system whereby neighboring communities and other stakeholders \nwill inform DOE or other pertinent agencies of any unlawful activities that they detect. DOE staff \nwill be the main beneficiaries of this output; they will be trained on the job in how to develop and \nimplement a water pollution mapping and reporting system, and how to maintain and update the \ndatabase. \n \n9.  Output 2: Incentive or reward system for pollution control piloted. It is imperative to \nseek cooperation from existing and potential pollution sources such as industries and real estate \ndevelopers, to ensure water supply of good quality and in adequate quantity from Meghna River \nto Dhaka. While the enforcement mechanism will be strengthened under output 1, conventional \ncommand-and-control measures alone will not be effective considering the current monitoring \ncapacity and the difficulty of taking action against violators. Moreover, the key objective should \nnot be to penalize violators, but to maintain or even improve the quality of water bodies. \nTherefore, this output will devise an incentive or reward system (e.g., market-based tools) to \nmotivate polluters to take pollution-control measures. Tasks include (i) conducting stakeholder \nconsultations (mainly with pollution sources) to discuss a workable system; (ii) developing such \na  system  and  implementing  it  on  a  pilot  basis;  and  (iii)  reviewing  lessons  from  the  pilot \nimplementation and proposing ways to improve and/or upscale the system. Technical auditing \nof, and provision of training to, industries will be a part of the pilot program, with a view to \nenhancing  production  efficiencies  of  factory  operations  while  reducing  the  pollution  loads. \nIndustries along the relevant section of the river will benefit from this output. DOE will participate \nin these tasks to strengthen knowledge and capacity.     \n \n10.  Output 3: Ecologically critical area identified and prepared for designation. Once \ndesignated as an ECA, additional measures can be taken to restrict development activities that \naffect the ecological value of the area. This output will enable the government to designate the \nrelevant section of Meghna River as an ECA. Tasks include (i) undertaking a comprehensive \nbackground study to assess the ecological importance of the area, (ii) drafting the documents \nrequired for ECA designation, (iii) consulting with stakeholders to finalize the ECA proposal, and \n(iv) providing support for its approval by the government. DOE staff will be closely involved in \neach step to ensure effective implementation. \n \n11.  Output  4:  Training  programs  completed.  This output will help equip government \nofficers and other stakeholders with knowledge and skills to operationalize the monitoring and \nreporting system. Tasks include (i) assessing DOE\u2019s capacity gaps, such as the gap between \nexisting and required efficiency levels of its laboratories, with a view to strengthening monitoring ", "4 \nand enforcement, particularly of the water quality of Meghna River; (ii) preparing a plan to \ngradually  boost  DOE\u2019s  capacities  both  in  terms  of  human  resources  and  facilities  and \nequipment, as required by the gap assessment; (iii) preparing a capacity development program \nfor  DOE  officials  (including  staff  of  district  offices),  local  government  bodies,  and  other \norganizations  concerned;  and  (iv)  implementing  the  program  through  classroom  training, \nworkshops  and  seminars,  and  on-the-job  training.  Collaboration  with  laboratories  of  other \norganizations, such as those of DWASA and the Department of Public Health Engineering, will \nbe explored. Public awareness programs will target people living along the relevant section of \nthe river, as well as Dhaka\u2019s general population. This will raise appreciation of the need to \nmaintain the water quality of Meghna River, and encourage pollution-prevention activities by the \npublic as well as industries.  \n \n12.  Assumptions and risks. A major risk is that the government may not stay committed to \nstricter enforcement. Political and social implications may make it difficult to suspend factory \noperations when violations occur. Insufficient staff numbers at DOE also make it difficult to \neffectively  monitor  pollution-prone  activities.  At  present,  however,  the  government  is \nstrengthening enforcement actions against violators, and DOE is gradually increasing its staff \nresponsible for monitoring. Technical guidance on cleaner production processes is expected to \ncreate a win\u2013win situation for industries and the environment. Furthermore, public awareness \nprograms will exert social pressure to take action against violators. With these measures, the \nrisks can be mitigated to a manageable level.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,050,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  (i)  any  relevant  documents,  data,  statistics, \ninformation, or maps that the government has at its disposal; (ii) adequate number of qualified \ncounterpart  staff,  mainly  from  DOE  and  DWASA,  including  their  field  per  diem  and  field \ntransportation; (iii) office accommodation and office equipment, including desks, chairs, and \nlocal communication (but excluding minimal office and monitoring equipment); (iv) logistical \nassistance to the workshops and seminars, including sending invitations to participants; and \n(v) other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  DOE will be the executing agency and will appoint qualified counterpart staff, including a \nproject director, to take the lead in supervising all tasks performed by the consultants and \ncoordinating the activities with relevant organizations. DWASA will be the partner agency and \nwill appoint a project coordinator. A national steering committee (NSC) and a working committee \nwill be established to monitor TA implementation. The NSC will be chaired by the secretary of \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  and comprise  high-level  representatives from  the \nPlanning Commission, DOE, DWASA, Board of Investment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of \nWorks,  Ministry  of  Land,  Ministry  of  Labor,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests,  Local \nGovernment Division, Water Resources Planning Organization, Department of Inspection for \nFactories  and  Establishments,  industrial  associations,  and  environmental  nongovernment \norganizations. The project director will act as the secretary of the NSC. The NSC will meet at \nleast twice a year to discuss overall TA progress, strengthen interministerial coordination, and \nprovide policy guidance for TA implementation. ADB representative(s) will attend the meetings \nas observer(s). The working committee will be chaired by the director general of DOE and \ncomprise working-level representatives from similar organizations. The working committee may ", "5 \nalso invite representatives from local government bodies such as upazila, pourashava, and \nunion  parishad  at  upstream  and  downstream  of  the  raw  water  intake  sites.  The  working \ncommittee  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  discuss  the  progress  of  each  activity,  including \nproblems encountered and actions to resolve them. Several consultation workshops will be held \nduring TA implementation to ensure active stakeholder engagement. The workshops will also \nserve  as  a  venue  to  share  findings,  good  practices,  and  project  lessons  throughout  TA \nimplementation. ADB will undertake a TA review at least twice a year during implementation.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from May 2015 to May 2017. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. International expertise (16.5 person-\nmonths) will be obtained in the areas of environmental management, industrial pollution control, \nand  policy  and regulatory  development.  National  consultants  (73  person-months)  will  have \nexpertise in the fields of environmental management, industrial pollution control, environmental \nmonitoring,  institutional  and  policy  development,  community  mobilization  and  participation, \nresource economics, surveys, geographic information systems, and fisheries. The consultants \nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time), and recruited through a firm under one package using the quality- \nand cost-based method of selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. This ratio is justified \nbecause the assignments require a high level of expertise and quality. A simplified technical \nproposal  will  be  used. In  addition  to  the  consulting team  described  in  Appendix  3,  a few \nindividual consultants may be engaged to cover specific TA needs. Resource persons from \nJapan will be invited to participate in the  workshops and/or training programs as needed. \nDisbursement under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Some equipment such as \ncomputers  and  monitoring  equipment  will  be  procured  using  the  shopping  method,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). All \nequipment purchased under the TA will be turned over to DOE after TA completion. ADB will \nadminister procurement and disbursement.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction, for Strengthening Monitoring and Enforcement in the Meghna River for Dhaka's \nSustainable Water Supply, and hereby reports this action to the Board.      \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact  By 2020:    Risk \nSustainable water  Water quality of  DOE and DWASA  Pollution or water \nsupply from Meghna  Meghna River at the  reports  abstraction upstream of the \nRiver to Dhaka City is  intake sites is    designated section will get \nensured  maintained above    out of control.  \ngovernment standards     \n(baseline: present     \nwater quality of \nMeghna River)a \nOutcome  By 2017:    Assumptions \nGovernment capacity  DOE monitors water  DOE reports  Government staff who \nfor monitoring the  quality monthly, and    receive training remain in \nwater quality of  semiannually updates    their positions. \nMeghna River and  pollution-prone     \nenforcing laws to  activities upstream    Government\u2019s continued \nmaintain it is  and downstream of    political commitment to \nstrengthened   the proposed water    enforcement \nintake sites     \n     \nEnforcement actions  DOE reports \nare taken in \naccordance with the \nlaws \nOutputs       \n1.
