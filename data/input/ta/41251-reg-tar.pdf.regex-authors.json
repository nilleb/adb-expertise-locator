The Governance Cooperation Fund (GCF) was established in November 2001 as a \nmultidonor  umbrella  facility  to  support  government-led  governance-related  reforms.  GCF- \nsupported activities must have strong links to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) operational \nactivities and/or concerns consistent with the country partnership strategies (CPSs). The GCF \nhas financed technical assistance (TA) grants for policy advice, project preparation, training, \ncapacity development, and institutional support activities. In 2005, ADB undertook two important \nstudies:  (i) a review of the GCF (GCF Review); and (ii) a review of the implementation of ADB\u2019s \nGovernance and Anticorruption Policies (GAC Review). The GCF Review considered the impact \nof the GCF on implementation of ADB\u2019s first governance action plan.1 The findings of the two \nreviews have implications for the GCF\u2019s future operation. The GCF, through the TA, has an \nimportant role to play in mainstreaming and adding value to the implementation of ADB\u2019s \ngovernance  and  anticorruption  policies,  and  specifically  will  support  the  implementation  of \nADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan  (GACAP  II).  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The GCF Review found that the GCF has funded a large number of small disparate \nprojects,  which  were  not  addressing  fundamental  governance  issues  constraining  the \ndevelopment effectiveness of ADB\u2019s overall program.3 The GCF was hindered by a lack of focus \nin its design, which was very ambitious given the resources available, and could not respond \nquickly to emerging opportunities as approval processes were cumbersome. Dissemination of \nexperiences from innovative projects was limited by the lack of a knowledge management \nsystem.  \n \n3.  The GAC Review also found that full implementation of the first governance action plan \nhad been hampered by the ambitious nature of the plan and the tenuous ownership in ADB. \nGACAP II, which was approved in July 2006, identifies three governance themes that are critical \nto the effectiveness of development assistance and poverty reduction, and are relevant to a \nsignificant proportion of ADB\u2019s lending and TA: (i) public financial management (PFM); (ii) \nprocurement; and (iii) combating corruption through preventive, enforcement, and investigative \nmeasures.  The  priority  governance  themes  apply  to  (i)  national  and  subnational  levels  of \ngovernment,  including  municipalities;  and  (ii)  operationally  relevant  sectors  in  developing \nmember countries (DMCs).  \n \n4.  To address these issues, GACAP II is focused on four key result areas (KRAs):  KRA1 \u2013 \nto improve identification and management of governance, institutional, and corruption risks in \nCPSs, midterm review of CPSs, and annual country portfolio review missions; KRA2 \u2013 to \nstrengthen governance and anticorruption components in projects and project design; KRA3 \u2013 \nto strengthen program and project administration and portfolio management; and KRA4 \u2013 to \nimprove organizational structure, human resources, and access to expertise.

Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 14 September 2007.  \n3  As at 30 June 2007, the GCF has funded 22 separate TAs for a total of $4,770,000. TA amounts have ranged from \n$100,000 to $600,000.  \n ", "2   \nassistance  (RETA)  6385:  Governance  and  Capacity  Development  Initiative,4 is  providing \nsupport to KRA1.   \n \n5.  KRA2 outcomes under GACAP II focus on program and project designs that incorporate \nfindings of risk assessments and project documentation that clearly identifies risks and risk \nmanagement and mitigation measures. Project administration requirements must be designed, \ntaking into consideration findings of the risk assessment undertaken for PFM, procurement, and \ncorruption.  \n \n6.  KRA3 outcomes emphasize strengthening program and project administration through \neffective management of program and project risks and performance reporting. To support \nthese efforts, it is recognized that ADB resident missions (RMs) have a significant role to play, \nand a key outcome for KRA4 is a clearly defined role for regional departments and RMs in \ngovernance and anticorruption, which is resourced and implemented through a flexible strategy \nfor the institutionalization phase of GACAP II.    \n \n7.  The GAC Review underlined the important role civil society organizations (CSOs) can \nand should play in mitigating corruption risks in DMC operations. CPSs and project documents \nshould explicitly describe how DMC government policies and practices engage civil society in \ncombating corruption. Further, the CPSs should clearly define the role to be played by civil \nsociety  in  mitigating  corruption  risks  in  ADB  operations.  GACAP  II  further  reinforced  the \nimportant role of civil society with subactions under KRA2 requiring that, where feasible and on \nthe basis of an assessment of civil society capacity (conducted jointly with the DMC), measures \nshould be considered to \u201cintegrate mechanisms for grassroots CSOs to monitor project results \nduring project implementation.\u201d \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  proposed  TA  is  intended  to  provide  support  to  KRA2,  KRA3,  and  KRA4.  The \nexpected  impact  is  improved  quality  of  governance,  which  contributes  to  sustainable \ndevelopment in DMCs. The expected outcome is strengthened governance in participating \nDMCs in areas of PFM, procurement, and combating corruption. All DMCs that meet the criteria \noutlined in Appendix 2 are eligible to participate in the TA. The TA will have four outputs. \n \n9.  Output 1: Risk Assessments and Risk Mitigation Plans for Projects in ADB Priority \nSectors. The GCF will support the preparation of risk assessments and design of risk mitigation \nmeasures at project level. For DMCs where a CPS with GACAP II application has not yet been \nprepared, if a project preparatory TA or project design document has explicitly included a risk \nassessment\u2015on an exceptional basis\u2015the TA could support a subproject that addresses the \nrisks identified. The risk assessments will be prepared in partnership with DMC governments.   \n \n10.  Output 2: Subprojects Addressing Risk Mitigation Measures at Country, Sector, or \nProject Level in Priority Areas for ADB Operations. The risk mitigation plans, formulated as \npart of the CPS preparation and project design processes, define the scope of ADB\u2019s forward \nthematic governance and anticorruption program. The TA will support implementation of risk \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Governance and Capacity Development Initiative. Manila. The approved $1.6 \nmillion RETA includes a budget of $1.0 million to support preparation of tools and guidelines for preparing \ngovernance risk assessments and risk mitigation plans to inform the CPSs. \n ", "  3\nmitigating  measures  across  a  broad  spectrum  of  initiatives  in  ADB\u2019s  priority  thematic \ngovernance areas of PFM, procurement, and combating corruption, at country, sector, or project \nlevel.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Subprojects  Addressing  Knowledge  Dissemination  and  Monitoring. \nInvestments are needed in measures that will improve access to information on implementation \nand monitoring of risk mitigation measures and plans at country, sector, and project levels. \nGACAP II places emphasis on involving CSOs to promote links between DMC governments and \ncitizens to strengthen participation and improve accountability. Output 3 will support initiatives in \nthese areas, including actively promoting participation of civil society, where appropriate. \n \n12.  Output 4: Provision of Long-Term National Governance Consultants to Resident \nMissions. The TA will provide support for long-term national governance consultants (with \nexpertise  in  PFM,  procurement,  combating  corruption,  and/or  governance  institutional  and \ncorruption risk assessments) in at least five RMs. This will enable ADB to augment current staff \nresources  to  support  the  implementation  of  GACAP  II,  and  subsequent  governance  and \nanticorruption action plans, in a sustainable manner over the long term.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will support the implementation of GACAP II at the project and program level, \nand will complement support provided by RETA 6385, which provides resources for undertaking \ncountry and sector level risk assessments that inform the preparation of CPSs. The TA will \nprovide resources for ADB to implement risk mitigation measures identified through country- \nand  sector-level  assessments,  which  are  subsequently  addressed  in  the  design  of  risk \nmitigation plans at project level. Risk mitigation measures can include training, seminars, and \nconferences  for  government  officials,  CSOs,  and  other  stakeholders.  Surveys  could  be \nundertaken to clarify project-level risks, obtain feedback on service delivery, or collect baseline \ndata for monitoring risks. Details of these activities will be included in subproject proposals. \nBudgets for subprojects for outputs 2 and 3 are estimated to range from $50,000 to $250,000. \nThe TA will support 10\u201315 subprojects. \n \n14.  The four outputs will be mutually reinforcing, leading to quality risk assessments and risk \nmitigation plans for ADB projects (output 1), which will provide the foundation for the design of \npractical  interventions  that  address  the  key  vulnerabilities  to  governance,  institutional  and \ncorruption risk in key sector projects (output 2), with attention to sustainability of risk mitigation \nmeasures through support to up-to-date and reliable information and monitoring systems to \nensure  that  risk  mitigation  measures  are  not  reversed  in  the  future  (output  3).  National \ngovernance  consultants  (output  4)  will  provide  support  to  achieve  outputs  1,  2,  and  3  in \nparticipating  DMCs,  and  will  assist  capacity  development  efforts  for  the  implementation  of \nGACAP  II  in  RMs.  Combined,  these  four  integrated  outputs  will  achieve  strengthened \ngovernance in participating DMCs. \n \n15.  For output 1, the TA will support the preparation of risk assessments and design of risk \nmitigation measures for ADB projects that address ADB\u2019s three thematic governance priorities \nof  PFM,  procurement,  and  combating  corruption.5 For  output  2,  the  TA  will  support  risk \nmitigating measures identified in country-, sector-, and project-level risk assessment and risk \nmitigation plans. For output 3, the focus will be on information and monitoring mechanisms to \n                                                 \n5  Risk assessments and risk mitigation plans should be informed by country level and sector risk assessments and \nrisk mitigation plans prepared as part of the CPS formulation process.  \n ", "4   \nensure  that  the  proposed  risk  mitigation  measures  are  implemented  as  planned,  and  are \nsustained over time. In DMCs where CSOs have the capacity to undertake monitoring functions, \nthey should be encouraged to participate. For output 4, the TA will support the development of \ninternal ADB capacities and deepen our knowledge of core governance issues in selected \ncountries. \n \n16.  Consistent with ADB\u2019s second medium term strategy and ADB\u2019s endorsement of the \n2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and as specified in GACAP II, where possible, \ninitiatives under all outputs should seek to (i) work with multilateral and bilateral development \npartners;  (ii)  increase  the  number  of  joint  sector  and  thematic  analyses;  (iii)  harmonize \ndiagnostic reviews; (iv) adopt common performance measures for PFM,  procurement, and \nanticorruption measures; (v) develop joint PFM, procurement, and anticorruption programs; and \n(vi) actively promote risk assessment and program-based approaches.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA, estimated at $2.6 million equivalent, will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the GCF.6  Funding from the GCF will be administered by ADB. The TA proceeds will \ncover  consulting  services,  training,  seminars,  conferences,  surveys  and  other  studies,  and \nreports and publications. Indicative cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The GCF Review highlighted weaknesses in the implementation arrangements including \n(i) inability to respond to emerging governance initiatives in a timely manner, and (ii) lack of \nflexibility to fund small short-term governance initiatives. High administration costs spread over \na large number of relatively small projects resulted in a very high ratio of administrative costs to \ndisbursements. To address these issues and reduce administration costs, the remaining GCF \nfunds will be disbursed through a RETA modality.7  \n \n19.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will  implement  the  TA.  The  Capacity \nDevelopment and Governance Division (RSCG) of the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment (RSDD), in collaboration with the regional departments, will be responsible for all \nTA activities. The TA will be implemented from February 2008 to January 2011.  \n \n20.  For output 1, regional departments and RMs will submit to RSCG for review (i) brief \nproposals  describing  the  scope  of  the  risk  assessments  and  risk  mitigation  plans  to  be \nundertaken; (ii) confirmation of a government\u2019s request for ADB support; (iii) detailed terms of \nreference for consultants; and (iv) detailed budgets. Proposals must refer to the country and \nsector risk assessments informing the proposed project risk assessment. For outputs 2 and 3, \nsubproject concepts may be developed by staff in the regional departments, RMs, and RSDD, in \ncollaboration  with  implementing  agencies  in  DMCs.  Proposed  subproject  activities  will  be \ndescribed in short concept papers, which will be screened initially by RSCG. Project concepts \nendorsed will be further developed into subproject proposals for review by the peer review \ncommittees composed of ADB staff with relevant expertise. Further details, including subproject \nselection criteria and processing requirements, are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n6   Contributors are the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n7  Previously, GCF-funded projects required endorsement from the governance committee, which met just once a \nyear to review proposals, followed by normal ADB TA processing procedures. ", "  5\n21.  The  department  or  RM  submitting  a  proposal  to  RSDD/RSCG  for  approval  will  be \nresponsible  for  (i)  obtaining  approval  of  the  concerned  Director  General  and  Director,  (ii) \nobtaining  a  no-objection  confirmation  from  the  concerned  DMC  government,  and  (iii) \nimplementing and monitoring the subproject in consultation with RSCG and other concerned \nstaff. Subprojects generated by departments at ADB headquarters will be implemented in close \ncooperation with the relevant RMs. To ensure mainstreaming of the TA activities, it is important \nthat governance and relevant sector staff work in collaboration. Project proposals with a budget \ngreater than $250,000, if approved by the peer review committee, will need to be cleared by the \nGCF  donor  governments  on  a  no-objection  basis.  Consultants  under  a  subproject  will  be \nidentified by the proposing departments. If RSDD/RSCG support is requested, assistance in \nconsultant selection will be provided. The processing of consultant requests will be managed by \nRSDD/RSCG.  The  regional  departments  will oversee  the  work  of  the  consultants  for  their \nrespective subprojects. \n \n22.  For output 4, regional departments will submit a prioritized list of requests for national \ngovernance consultants for RMs to RSDD/RSCG. Requests should include the rationale, which \naddresses the criteria for output 4 outlined in Appendix 2. RSCG will organize annual meetings \nof the governance consultants and ADB governance professionals to share lessons learned, \nand  review  progress  on  the  implementation  of  GACAP  II  and  forward  work  plans.  The \nconsultants will report to the respective country directors in the RMs.    \n \n23.  The TA will require international consultants (estimated 40 person-months) and national \nconsultants (estimated 290 person-months) with skills and expertise in governance, PFM, and \nanticorruption at country level and in priority sectors for ADB operations, as defined in the \nSecond  Medium  Term  Strategy  and  CPSs  for  participating  DMCs.  Terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants  will  be  further  specified  when  specific  TA  activities  are  identified  by  regional \ndepartments, RMs, and RSDD, and national governance consultants are recruited for RMs. \nRSCG  will  (i)  support  the  peer  review  committees,  (ii)  disseminate  information  on  fund \navailability and procedures, (iii) monitor subprojects, (iv) prepare financial and progress reports \nrequired  by  cofinanciers  of  the  GCF,  and  (v)  support  dissemination  of  TA  outputs.  As \ninstitutional  focal  point  for  the  GACAP  II,  RSCG  will  design  and  implement  knowledge \nmanagement  systems  to  ensure  that  lessons  learned  from  the  relatively  new  risk-based \napproach to governance assessments and governance project design and implementation are \nshared in a systematic manner with ADB staff. A portion of the administration fees received by \nADB from the GCF cofinanciers will be used to support a one- person secretariat in RSCG to \ncoordinate RETA activities. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. Consultants will be \nrecruited as individuals. Where appropriate, NGOs will be recruited. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n24.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,600,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernance Cooperation Fund, for Support for Implementation of the Second Governance and \nAnticorruption Action Plan. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved quality of  \u2022 Progress on  \u2022 Progress reports on DMC  \u2022 DMCs are committed to \ngovernance, which  implementation of DMC  national and sector  implementing national and \ncontributes to sustainable  national and sector  development plans, and  sector development plans \ndevelopment in DMCs  development, and poverty  poverty reduction plans  focused on socially inclusive \nreduction plans  growth and poverty reduction. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nStrengthened governance  \u2022 improved PFM   \u2022 PEFA assessments (due  \u2022 DMCs are committed to \nin participating DMCs in  indicators   diligence of the budget  implementing risk mitigation \nareas of PFM,    process)  measures to strengthen the \nprocurement, and  \u2022 improved public  \u2022 Public expenditure reviews  quality of governance. \ncombating corruption  procurement indicators  (poverty orientation of the   \n  budget)   \n\u2022 Strengthened national  \u2022 National procurement   \nintegrity systems over  system assessments (OECD \ntime  joint venture framework) \n\u2022 TI national integrity system \nassessments  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Specific criteria for prioritizing subproject proposals include \n(i)  the potential for significant mainstreaming of externalities at country and/or sector \nlevel;  \n(ii)  clear demonstration of how the investments in specific project(s) will be sustained;  \n(iii)  demonstrated  commitment  from  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)/other \npartners  through  cost-sharing  or  other  specific  steps  in  implementing  the \nmitigating measures; and  \n(iv)  elements of innovation.  \n \nThe RSCG will ensure that there is a balance in TA initiatives across regional departments. \n \nB.  Criteria for Selecting Governance Specialists in Resident Missions (RMs) \n4.  RMs in which national governance specialist positions will be established will be selected \non the basis of (i) demand from the regional department; (ii) perceived levels of governance, \nprocurement, and corruption risk inherent in ADB operations; and (iii) the existence of a forward \ngovernance  program  in  the  country.  Equitable  distribution  of  resources  across  all  regional \ndepartments will be considered. \n \nC.   Subproject Selection and Approval Processes \n5.  For output 1, regional departments and RMs will submit to RSCG for review (i) brief \nproposals  describing  the  scope  of  the  risk  assessments  and  risk  mitigation  plans  to  be \nundertaken, (ii) confirmation of the government\u2019s request for ADB support, (iii) detailed terms of \nreference for consultants, and (iv) detailed budgets. Proposals must refer to the country and \nsector risk assessments informing the proposed project risk assessment.   \n \n6.  For outputs 2 and 3, subproject concepts may be developed by staff in the regional \ndepartments, RMs, and RSDD, in collaboration with implementing agencies in DMCs. Proposed \nsubproject activities will be described in short concept papers, which will be screened initially by \nRSCG.  Project  concepts  endorsed  for  onward  processing  will  be  further  developed  into \nsubproject proposals. RSCG will convene peer review committees, composed of ADB staff with \nexpertise in the subject matter of the subproject proposals, to review and approve the proposals. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nPeer review committees reviewing subprojects involving civil society organizations will include \nrepresentation from the NGO and Civil Society Center. For efficiency, peer review committees \nwill  review  batches  of  subproject  proposals  as  they  are  submitted  to  RSCG.  Subproject \nproposals will include (i) a brief summary of the risk mitigation plans and measures the project \nseeks to address; (ii) confirmation of the government\u2019s request for ADB support; (iii) project \ndescription  including  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  activities,  and  inputs;  (iv)  implementation \narrangements; (v) design and monitoring framework; (vi) project budget; and (vii) terms of \nreference for consultants. RSCG will provide all regional departments and RMs with a simplified \nformat for subproject proposals following approval of the TA.  \n \n7.  For  output  4,  regional  departments  will  submit  to  RSDD/RSCG  a  prioritized  list  of \nrequests  for  national  governance  consultants  for  RMs,  with  rationale  that  addresses  the \nselection criteria outlined in section B. RSCG will ensure an equitable distribution of resources \nacross regional departments. It is estimated that at least five RMs will be supported through the \nTA. \n \nD.  Accountability Mechanisms \n8.  The regional department or RM submitting a given proposal to RSDD/RSCG for approval \nwill (i) obtain the approval of the concerned Director General and Director; (ii) obtain a no-\nobjection confirmation from the concerned DMC government; and (iii) implement and monitor \nthe subproject in consultation with RSCG and other concerned staff. Subprojects generated by \ndepartments at ADB headquarters will be implemented in close cooperation with the relevant \nRMs. To ensure mainstreaming of the TA activities, governance and relevant sector staff will \nwork in collaboration. Project proposals with a budget greater than $250,000, if approved by the \npeer review committee, will need to be cleared by the Governance Cooperation Fund donor \ngovernments on a no-objection basis. Consultants under a subproject will be identified by the \nproposing departments. If RSCG/RSDD support is requested, it will assist in consultant selection. \nRSDD/RSCG will manage the processing of consultant requests. The regional departments will \noversee the work of the consultants for their respective subprojects. \n \n9.  Regional  departments  that  are  allocated  national  governance  consultants  will  (i) \nadvertise the position locally; (ii) in consultation with RSCG, prepare a shortlist of potential \ncandidates, arrange interviews, and participate in the selection process; (iii) in consultation with \nRSCG,  develop  a  work  program  and  provide  day-to-day  administrative  guidance;  and  (iv) \nprovide  suitable  work  space,  furniture,  and  equipment  including  computers  and  computer \nconnections, work-related transport, and reasonable administrative/secretarial support.
