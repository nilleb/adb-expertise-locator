INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic requested technical assistance (TA), during the \n2002 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for advice on \nbanking sector and financial market reform initiatives to continue the ADB-supported Financial \nIntermediation  and  Resource  Mobilization  Program  (FIRM).1  Subsequent  fact-finding  and \nconsultation missions reconfirmed the understanding reached and finalized the TA objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements. The logical framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The financial sector has been transformed significantly since the transition to a market \neconomy started. Over the last decade, measures were taken to shift the banking system \ninherited from the Former Soviet Union to a market orientation and to establish capital markets. \nHowever, macroeconomic difficulties, the contagion from the Russian financial crisis, and slow \nprogress  in  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  restructuring  impeded  the  financial  sector\u2019s \ndevelopment.  Although  the  basic  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  has  been \nestablished  and  the  immediate  and  most  direct  effects  of  the  Russian  crisis  have  been \novercome, the financial sector does not yet significantly contribute to the wider development \ngoal. The role of the sector in financial intermediation and resource mobilization and in instilling \ngood governance norms in enterprises outside the financial sector is not significant.  \n \n3.  Banking  sector  regulation  and  supervision  have  been  substantially  improved,  but \nremaining gaps increase the sector\u2019s vulnerability and limit the confidence of the population as \nwell as the interest of investors in financial institutions. Most notable here are insufficient \ncapacities of the National Bank of Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) to assess risks related to the \noperations of commercial banks, and the lack of proactive measures to establish adequate risk \nrating and risk management procedures within them. Regulatory guidance is still lacking for \nmarket, interest rate, operational, country, or transfer risk assessment and management. \n \n4.  The restructuring of remaining problem banks is not yet finalized, and consolidation of the \nbanking sector has only started. Both factors considerably limit the banking sector\u2019s role in \nfinancial intermediation as consolidation is a prerequisite to pool a critical mass of resources for \nmeaningful levels of intermediation. The number of banks has declined from 24 to 20 over the last \n3 years, and financial intermediation ratios are still comparatively low.3 One key problem is that \nNBKR is facing serious problems in enforcing prudential norms to prevent weak banks from \ncontinuing operations. These difficulties seem to result from a combination of weaknesses in the \ncourt system, remaining shortcomings in banking sector legislation, and suboptimal preparation of \ncases by NBKR, given the negative perception of the court system and recent frequent rulings \nagainst NBKR. \n \n5.  The Government has not finalized its position yet on resolving Kairat Bank, a major \nstate-owned commercial bank, which accounts for about 11% of the capital of the banking \nsector. The uncertainty of the future of the bank has affected its financial and operational \nposition. The bank\u2019s profitability is declining as it depends largely on the margin between \ndeposit rates and yields of treasury bills, due to restrictions on lending. Finally, the  lack of a \nstrategic framework to involve foreign investors in restructuring and consolidating the banking \n                                                 \n1  Loan 1723 approved in December 1999 in the amount of SDR25.2 million. FIRM will be completed in 2002. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 2002. \n3  The ratio of banking sector assets and deposits to gross domestic product (GDP) stood at 6.7% and 3.4%, \nrespectively,  at  end-2001.  The  ratio  of  broad  money  to  GDP  is  quite  low,  by  regional  and  international \ncomparisons, at 7.4%.  ", "2 \nsystem is also a major problem, since few transition economies have managed to reform their \nbanking systems without a systematic integration of foreign banks. \n \n6.  The  legal  and  institutional  framework  supporting  creditor  rights  continues  to  be \ninadequate. In case of a borrower\u2019s payment difficulties, bank managers have strong incentives to \nextend maturities, settle for partial repayments, and roll over credits, rather than foreclose assets \nof  insolvent  enterprises  through  the  court  system,  as  enforcement  procedures  are  slow, \nunreliable, and costly. Kyrgyz legislation and banking sector regulation also prevent banks from \nlending  to  financially  restructure  insolvent  enterprises  that  implement  restructuring  or \nreorganization plans agreed upon by creditors.4 As a consequence of both factors, the propensity \nof commercial banks to provide credit to the real sector is lower than it otherwise would be. To \noffset high regulatory risks, lenders have adopted a policy of fully securing all the loans in nearly \nall corporate transactions, and the collateral taken is typically twice the loan value. \n \n7.  Although the volume of primary issues of securities on the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange \n(KSE) is increasing, the general role of capital markets in mobilizing resources and improving \nfinancial disclosure and corporate governance practices in the enterprise sector is still small due \nto a combination of shortcomings.5 First, supervision and regulation of capital markets are still \nnot adequate. The State Commission for Security Markets (SCSM), the supervisory agency, has \nlimited financial and operational autonomy and weak technical and professional capacity. SCSM \nis not capable of supervising the 60 professional participants of the securities markets and 400 \njoint  stock  companies  (JSC)  whose  stocks  are  traded.  Second,  privatization  of  viable \nenterprises through KSE is lacking, without which development of healthy equity markets has \nproven to be difficult in many transition economies. Enterprises offered for privatization through \nKSE have frequently not been sold due to insufficient information disclosure and lack of any \nserious restructuring to attract investors.  \n \n8.  Only a fraction of the JSCs are willing and able to comply with listing requirements and \nenhanced corporate governance standards, which deters JSCs\u2019 entry into capital markets. Only \n24 companies are still listed on KSE, compared to 64 at end-2000.6 Shares of nonlisted \ncompanies are also traded at KSE as a result of a presidential decree in May 1999, which \nrequired all equity trading to go through KSE without specifying listing as a precondition. These \nobservations point to the importance of two factors to develop the equity market: (i) corporate \nrestructuring  and  enhancing  investor  confidence  through  better  corporate  governance, \ncontinuing the efforts that have been supported over the last four years; and (ii) the need to \nquickly reach a critical level of trading volume to attract investors, which would, in turn, increase \nthe incentive for companies to get a listing.  \n \n9.  Trading in government securities, such as treasury bills, takes place exclusively between \nKyrgyz banks on trading platforms in NBKR, resulting in conflicts of interests for NBKR, as it is \nnot only the market regulator but also a market participant. Secondary trading in treasury \nsecurities is also very low. These factors have reduced the attractiveness of Kyrgyz government \nsecurities for investors, as a consequence of which the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has been \nforced to offer higher yields for these securities. Yet, the market is not a significant source of \nfunding for the Government. \n                                                 \n4  Banks are forbidden to (i) hold more than 15% ownership in legal entities and (ii) extend credit to insolvent \nenterprises. \n5  The highest estimate of total stock market capitalization by KSE as of May 2001 is Som1.5 million ($33 million). \n6  The top four enterprises, which account for 70% of the capital stock in the economy, are JSCs Kyrgyz Energo, \nKyrgyz Telecom, Kyrgyz Gas, and Kyrgyz Airlines; only Kyrgyz Telecom remains listed after the delisting of Kyrgyz \nGas and Kyrgyz Energo in 2001. Out of 14 financial institutions listed in 2000, 6 were delisted in 2001; 8 \ncommercial banks are still listed. ", "    3 \n \n10.  ADB has supported financial sector development in the Kyrgyz Republic through TA,7 \nand the FIRM Program, which was provided to continue the reforms launched under the World \nBank\u2019s Financial Sector Adjustment Credit and focused on (i) strengthening banking sector \noversight,  (ii)  restructuring  and  consolidating  the  banking  system,  (iii)  developing  the \nGovernment's securities market, and (iv) facilitating the development of the equity markets. ADB \nhas also supported the development of rural financial institutions.8 A key lesson from the FIRM \nProgram is that progress in enterprise reforms is a precondition for progress in financial sector \nreforms.  As  a  result  of  progress  being  made  under  the  second  phase  of  the  Corporate \nGovernance and Enterprise Reform Program supported by ADB\u2014introducing good corporate \ngovernance  standards  in  JSCs,  adopting  international  accounting  and  financial  reporting \nstandards, and restructuring selected large enterprises\u2014the Government wishes to formulate \nmeasures to strengthen the financial sector.  \n \n11.  ADB has closely coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World \nBank, which are jointly assessing the financial sector under their Financial Sector Assessment \nProgram. World Bank is preparing a financial sector and business environment program, which \nwill  focus  on  restructuring  and  privatizing  Settlement  and  Savings  Bank,  institutionally \nstrengthening the Debt Restructuring Agency, and implementing payment system reforms. IMF \nis providing short-term advisory support to NBKR on risk assessment in the banking system. \nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is providing legal advice on \nsecurities market legislation. ADB\u2019s efforts will focus on capacity building for efficient risk \nmanagement in commercial banks as well as the central bank, and the securities market \ncomponent will focus on medium- to long-term development needs. \n \n \nIII.
