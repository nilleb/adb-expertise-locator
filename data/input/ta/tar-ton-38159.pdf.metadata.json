In April 2004 during the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) annual Country Programming \nMission,  the  Government  of  Tonga  confirmed  its  request  to  ADB  for  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) to improve its capacity for strategic and development planning to enhance \npublic sector performance and prepare the country\u2019s Eighth Strategic Development Plan 2005\u2013\n2008 (SDP8). The TA has been included in the TA program for 2004 as reflected in ADB\u2019s \nCountry Strategy and Program Update of July 2004. An ADB Fact-Finding mission1 visited \nTonga during 11\u201320 October 2004 to reach an understanding with the Government on the \nobjectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consulting services of the TA.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  A planning approach to development in Tonga began in 1965 with the first Five-Year \nDevelopment Plan covering 1965\u20131969. Six periodic plans have since been implemented, with \nSDP7 2001\u201320043 under way. Despite Tonga\u2019s long planning tradition, a centralized approach, \ncompounded by lack of adequate prioritization, undermines the country's planning approach. \nTonga  needs  to  plan  its  public  resource  use  carefully,  but  based  on  a  decentralized  and \nparticipatory approach to focus on higher sustainable economic growth while ensuring financial \nstability and investing in people as identified in SDP7 to achieve the Vision for Tonga, 2025. \n \n3.  The long-term vision was set for the country together with strategic areas and policy \nguidelines to guide development activities and the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP). \nSDP7 identified areas with policy guidelines and the PSDP. The PSDP was to encapsulate the \npriority investment program and provide the link from SDP7 to the annual program budget. \nSDP7 was reviewed twice\u2014in February 2003 and February 2004\u2014to maintain a rolling 3-year \ninvestment program. The annual review was undertaken before the annual budget preparation \nso that SDP7 would be linked to the annual budget at the policy level, to the budget policy \nguidelines, and also at the programming level through the PSDP to the program budgets of \nministries and departments. \n \n4.  However, the Government recognized a number of weaknesses contributing to past \nplanning  problems:  (i)  overprogramming  and  a  failure  to  set  priorities,  considering  fiscal \nsustainability;4 (ii) excessive centralization; (iii) inadequate processes for securing commitment \nand  managing  political  interference;  (iv)  failure  to  specify  appropriate  implementation \narrangements with appropriate human resources and institutional capabilities; and (v) ineffective \nmonitoring  capacity.  To  effectively  address  these  challenges,  SDP8  should  include  a \nparticipatory process and integrate strategic planning with a medium-term fiscal framework and \nbudgeting. In addition, the process needs to incorporate other work undertaken by the sector \nministries/agencies, and those with the assistance of ADB5 and other external sources.6 \n \n                                                 \n1  The Mission comprised S. Ho, Principal Country Programs Specialist (Mission Leader), South Pacific Subregional \nOffice, Pacific Department.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 04 August 2004.   \n3  Central Planning Department. 2001.

Addressing  past  planning  problems  and  new  challenges  is  a  key  aspect  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s shift to program-based budgeting and 3-year rolling public investment programs. \nAcutely aware of these weaknesses and challenges, the Government has taken a focused and \neffective  participatory  approach  to  launch  and  implement  the  ADB-assisted  Economic  and \nPublic Sector Reform Program (EPSRP). The objective of the EPSRP is to facilitate private \nsector-led economic growth by (i) promoting policies that create an environment conducive to \nincreased investment and employment by the private sector, and (ii) improving efficiency and \neffectiveness of service delivery by the public sector. \n \n6.  The Government requested ADB to provide assistance for institutionalizing the planning \nprocess with linkages to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally \nagreed-upon social targets (for example the World Summit Sustainable Development Targets), \nmedium-term  framework  and  budgeting,  and  the  participatory  approach,  which  will  require \ncorresponding capacity building in the Government administration. The TA not only will aim to \nset priorities, but also will help establish participatory processes, and information bases and \nanalyses so that the Government, stakeholders, and general public can arrive at informed \ndecisions.  Such  decisions  will  recognize  the  trade-offs  and  costs  involved  in  choosing \ndevelopment priorities. \n \n7.  Past  weaknesses  in  planning  are  symptomatic  of  two  core  challenges  to  setting \npriorities. First, setting priorities is a complex technical task requiring detailed information, sound \nanalysis, and good judgment. The role and functions of the Central Planning Department (CPD) \nas an effective planning coordinator and agency are severely hampered due to fragmentation of \nboth regional planning, aid management, and project implementation. For regional planning, \nCPD is currently not represented in Vava\u2019u Development Committee, which reports directly to \nthe  Cabinet  and  Privy  Council,  and  is  different  from  the  four  other  regional  development \ncommittees,7  which  CPD  serves  as  secretariat  or  chairman  and  report  to  development \ncoordination  committee  (DCC)  and  the  Cabinet.  The  Government  needs  to  explore  and \nintroduce mechanisms to ensure coherent planning among the five regions in the country \nthrough  CPD  to  support  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  SDP8.  Regarding  aid \nmanagement, this function is currently shared by seven agencies8 in the Government. These \nagencies, including CPD, often also assume project implementation functions parallel to the \nfunctions  of  relevant  sector  line  ministries  and  departments.  Such  fragmentation  of  aid \nmanagement and project implementation may lead to inefficient use and underutilization of \nexternal resources. This arrangement also deviates from that in countries in the Asia and Pacific \nregion where (i) aid coordination and management fall under one agency and the responsibility \nof the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and (ii) project implementation falls under relevant sector line \nministries and departments. The Government is committed to address these issues through a \ndecision made by the Privy Council in late October 2004 that MOF will assume responsibility for \naid management and coordination of all funding agencies. Details for implementing the new \nmandate of MOF are being worked out among the concerned offices and ministries with the aim \n                                                 \n7  'Eua  Development  Committee,  Ha\u2019apai  Development  Committee,  Niua  Development  Committee,  and  Rural \nDevelopment Committee. \n8  Ministry of Finance (multilateral financial institutions including ADB  and the World Bank); Central Planning \nDepartment (Australia, New Zealand, Japan, United Nations Development Programme); Ministry of Foreign Affairs \n(European Union, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat); Ministry of Health (World \nHealth Organizations); Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (United Nations Children's Fund and United Nations \nEducational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization);  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Fisheries,  and  Food  (Food  and \nAgriculture  Organization  and  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development);  and  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office \n(Secretariat of the Pacific Community). \n ", "  3\nof harmonizing aid management and project implementation to better utilize limited external \nfunding. \n \n8.  Second, even sound priorities require social consensus. The TA aims to address both \nchallenges. It will help DCC and the MDG task force with technical aspects and participatory \nprocesses to secure stakeholder consensus. The Government, through CPD and MOF, has \nshown commitment and capacity to shift from the traditional structured top-down process to a \nmore participatory process in undertaking strategic planning and monitoring. Under quite difficult \ncircumstances, the Government is also tackling, frequently with ADB and other aid agencies, a \nnumber  of  critical  governance,  financial,  and  economic  policy  reforms  and  restructuring  to \npromote  private  sector-led  growth,  particularly  to  enhance  cash  income  opportunities,  and \naccess  to  and  quality  of  basic  social  services  in  the  country.  These  reform  efforts  and \nrestructuring are all essential building blocks in achieving higher sustainable economic growth, \nensuring financial stability, and investing in people\u2014objective that the Government is pursuing. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The objective of the TA is to help the Government prepare SDP8. It will improve the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity in strategic and development planning, with emphasis in establishing the \nprocess  to link  the  MDGs  and  other  economic and  social  targets,  the  medium-term  fiscal \nframework,  the  annual  budget  allocation,  and  departmental  corporate  plans.  An  improved \nprocess of medium-term strategic planning and public expenditure management will enable \nheads of departments (HODs) to focus on MDG-related operational objectives, achievement of \nthese objectives, and performance standards established under the recently implemented chief \nand senior executive service framework.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  ADB assistance will support the Government to develop and implement a participatory \nprocess involving all stakeholders, including aid agencies, in deriving a long-term strategic \nvision for achieving higher sustainable growth, ensuring financial stability, and investing in \npeople in Tonga. The TA will seek to set priorities based on realistic resource estimates and \nsecure support and commitment for those priorities from the Government, including central and \nline ministries, and among stakeholders through public consultation, seminars, and workshops. \nThe TA will help translate this vision into objectives and targets within a medium-term fiscal \nframework and budget. \n \n11.   The TA will (i) identify long-term options for higher sustainable growth as outlined in \nVision 2025; (ii) identify priorities and strategies for sustainable development, based on realistic \nresource estimates within a stable and sustainable macroeconomic and fiscal framework; (iii) \nspecify  procedures  for  implementing  SDP8  and  for  monitoring  performance,  including  the \nbudget process; and (iv) help ensure public participation and transparency in SDP8 preparation. \n \n  1.   Identify Long-Term Options \n \n12.   The TA will help the Government assess the main internal and external factors affecting \nTonga\u2019s  higher  sustainable  growth  in  the  long  term,  particularly  through  private  sector-led \ngrowth  in  production  and  employment.  Domestic  factors  include  (i)  migration  and  youth \nunemployment, (ii) structural vulnerability arising from high dependence on foreign remittances \n ", "4  \nand low agricultural growth, and (iii) progress in implementing the EPSRP. External factors to be \nconsidered are (i) possible tightening of immigration policies affecting Tongan\u2019s access to major \noverseas labor market, (ii) impact of Tonga\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nand (iii) regional development and cooperation in the Pacific. \n \n2.  Establish Priorities and Identify Financial and Institutional Constraints   \n \n13.  While SDP7 covers most issues, it fails to set priorities and achievable targets with a \nrealistic estimation of funds available and corresponding institution and capacity requirement. \nThe TA will build CPD\u2019s capacity in coordination with MOF to set priorities based on realistic \nmedium-term resource estimates. First, the TA must estimate the amount of development funds \navailable, initially focusing on Government resources and funding agencies contributions. But \nthe  TA  must  also  consider  private  sector  investment,  including  foreign  direct  investment \nparticularly based on the impact of the EPSRP. Second, the TA will help refine criteria for \nprogram and project appraisal. Third, the TA will help CPD prepare a framework for estimating \nand illustrating the impact of variations in plan priorities on promoting private sector-led growth \nin production and employment. \n \n3.  Specify Implementation and Monitoring Arrangements \n \n14.  Among the reasons for the weak performance of SDP7 are inadequate attention paid to \nimplementation procedures, and the limited information and resources available to CPD to \nmonitor outcomes. Priorities cannot be set without a realistic appreciation of implementation \nneeds and priorities. Ineffective monitoring also encourages plan slippage. Therefore, the TA \nwill help strengthen the capacity of CPD and MOF to specify and monitor the implementation \nprocess. \n \n4.  Develop and Apply Participatory Processes \n \n15.  Good lessons and experience with consultation and participation have been gained from \nformulating and implementing the EPSRP, but more effective and wider participation will be \nessential to promote a sense of ownership and consensus on SDP8. The TA will support the \npurchase of equipment and improvement of intranet services and CPD web site design, and \nmaintenance. The web site will strengthen public dissemination of the planning processes and \nprovide access to SDP8\u2019s database. Intranet enhancement within the Government will improve \ninter-agencies coordination and participation. The TA will utilize and improve the capabilities of \nexisting institutions, considering the limited capacities at all levels of government and society. \nThe SDP8 process will undertake consultation and participation through monthly meetings of \nHODs, private sector consultative committee, economic summit, and annual youth summit. The \nprocess will also engage nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and other agencies to roll out \nconsultation and participation to different segments of the society throughout the formulation \nand implementation of SDP8. A national summit is planned for the first quarter of 2005 to launch \nSDP8  preparation,  and  set  priorities  and  identify  financial  and  institutional  constraints.  A \nmeeting of aid agencies, with participation of stakeholders in the third quarter of 2005, will \nconsider the draft SDP8 before it is finalized. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $375,000 equivalent, comprising $215,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $160,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $300,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis, to be financed by ADB's TA funding program. The Government has \n ", "  5\nagreed to contribute in-kind services in the form of office accommodation, counterpart staff \nservices, and other administrative support estimated at $75,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncosts. Implications on the staff resources and additional operating costs for CPD are being \ndiscussed by CPD and MOF for effective implementation. To further enhance the process of \npublic consultation and consensus building throughout the formulation and implementation of \nSDP8, the Government is seeking parallel financing of $50,000 from other funding agencies, \nincluding the Governments of New Zealand and Australia, to support these activities. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Executing Agency will be CPD in close coordination with MOF. MOF will be the \nImplementing Agency for (i) enhancement of the macroeconomic and budget planning and \nprojection through macroeconomic advisory committee (MAC); and (ii) information technology \ndevelopment including web development in CPD and intranet development within government \nagencies. The DCC and the MDG task force will be the strategic core groups to guide TA \nimplementation, particularly the consultation and participation process. One international expert \n(advisor) to provide 6 person-months of consulting services and one domestic specialist (local \nteam leader) for 10 person-months will be required. The outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n18.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for recruiting \nthe domestic consultant. The advisor will be responsible for the quality and delivery of SDP8. \nThe local team leader will be responsible for the quality and implementation of the participatory \nprocess. Procurement under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment \nand systems procured under the TA will be handed over to the Government upon completion of \nthe TA. The Government will ensure that all required counterpart staff of CPD and MOF, other \nhuman resources, and support facilities will be available to the consultants in a timely manner. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented for 17 months from February 2005 to June 2006.  The \nconsultants will prepare and submit to the Government and ADB (i) an inception report including \nan issues paper outlining the approach and emerging factors and constraints and a detailed TA \nwork program, 1 month after the TA starts in preparation for a national summit; (ii) a one-page \nmonthly progress report indicating progress made and outstanding issues to be presented at the \nmonthly  meeting  of  HODs  and  concerned  committee  members;  (iii)  a  draft  final  report  in \npreparation for a meeting of aid agencies with stakeholder participation; and (iv) a final report \nsubmitted at the conclusion of the consulting services, based on the outcomes of the meeting of \naid agencies and further consultation and participation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of

General \n \n1.  The  principal  objective  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  help  the  Government \nprepare,  through  a  broad  participatory  approach,  a  clearly  prioritized  Eighth  Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2005\u20132008 (SDP8). SDP8 will establish linkages with the medium-term \nmacroeconomic  and  fiscal  framework,  the  departmental  corporate  plans,  and  the  annual \nbudgetary process. \n \n2.  The TA will undertake the following: \n \n(i)  identify long-term options to promote private sector-led growth in production and \nemployment  within  a  sustainable  medium-term  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \nframework; \n(ii)  establish priorities considering the human resource, financial, and institutional \nconstraints; \n(iii)  specify implementation and monitoring processes; and \n(iv)  formulate and implement consultation and participatory processes. \n \n3.  Implementation of these activities will cover 17 months from February 2005 to June \n2006. The activities will support the preparation and first phase implementation of SDP8 so that \nthe 2007 budget cycle (beginning March 2006) will fully reflect the priorities of and linkages \nbetween SDP8 and the departmental corporate plans. Procedures will be developed for public \nparticipation and priority setting in formulation and during implementation. These include: \n \n(i)  preparing  an  issues  paper  setting  out  the  approach  to  SDP8  formulation \n(including a review of SDP7), and proposed participatory processes to be posted \nin  the  Central  Planning  Department  (CPD)  web  site,  and  inviting  formal \nsubmissions and comments; \n(ii)  organizing a national summit, with technical and discussion papers to facilitate \nparticipation and consultation; \n(iii)  preparing a draft SDP8 based on further consultation and participation from the \nGovernment and other stakeholders; \n(iv)  organizing a meeting of aid agencies with stakeholder participation to review the \ndraft SDP8; and \n(v)  finalizing SDP8 based on further consultation with and participation from the \nGovernment and other stakeholders. \n \nB.
