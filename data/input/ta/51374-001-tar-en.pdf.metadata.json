INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  stakeholder \nconsultations in Asia and the Pacific for a corporate results framework aligned with Strategy 2030, \nthe new corporate strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The framework will guide an \nobjective and accurate assessment of ADB\u2019s development effectiveness using performance \ntargets and indicators that reflect the strategy\u2019s priorities. The TA is included in the 2018 \nManagement-approved work program of the Strategy, Policy and Review Department (SPD).1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  ADB is preparing Strategy 2030 to help reposition it in the rapidly changing global \nenvironment and the transforming development landscape of Asia and the Pacific. The new \nstrategy will guide ADB\u2019s operations and the delivery of its development assistance until 2030. \nADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  have  pledged  to  implement  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and the climate change actions under the Paris climate agreement. Fulfilling \nthese global commitments, filling the large financing gap for infrastructure, and addressing greater \nvulnerability caused by climate change will have implications for ADB\u2019s work. The strategy will \nalso emphasize strengthening climate resilience and the overall resilience of the DMCs, as well \nas responding to key mega trends such as increasing inequality, rapid technological change, \nurbanization, and aging. \n  \n3.  To help translate Strategy 2030 into measurable results, ADB will prepare a corporate \nresults framework aligned with the strategy. ADB\u2019s first corporate results framework, adopted in \n2008,  has  driven  the  institutionalization  of  results-based  management,  strengthened \naccountability for results, and improved the communication of corporate performance.2 Since \n2008, the framework has generated insights into ADB\u2019s performance and helped Management \ndetermine necessary reforms. In addition to its role as a management tool, the results framework \nserves the function of accountability and transparency by reporting annual performance results in \nthe  Development  Effectiveness  Review.3 The  scoring  system  introduced  in  2009  identifies \nwhether performance on an indicator is on track, on track but watch, or off track. This has helped \nhighlight performance strengths and challenges more precisely. Periodic updates have enabled \nADB to strengthen the results framework as a management tool and increase the relevance and \ncredibility of its assessment of performance. \n \n4.  Consistent with the principle of country ownership, it is vital to undertake comprehensive \nconsultations with the DMCs and other stakeholders on key areas to be monitored under the new \nresults framework. The new results framework will report on selected Sustainable Development \nGoals that are aligned with ADB\u2019s core areas of engagement under Strategy 2030. ADB is also \nsharpening  the  definition  and  measurement  of  inclusive  economic  growth.  In  addition, \nStrategy 2030 will emphasize climate change and disaster resilience; green, sustainable, resilient \nand inclusive infrastructure solutions; knowledge work; gender equality mainstreaming; and \nADB\u2019s internal efficiency and effectiveness. These will be among the key areas of measurement. \nFurther, the development constraints that ADB and the DMCs are working to overcome are \nchallenging, long-term, and cumulative. To provide a more complete performance story of ADB \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 February 2018. \n2 ADB. 2008. ADB Results Framework. Manila. \n3The Development Effectiveness Review has been published annually since 2008: \nhttp://adb.org/documents/series/development-effectivenessreview \n ", "2 \nand its contribution to development outcomes, ADB needs to carefully assess links between level \n1 of the results framework (development progress in Asia and the Pacific) and level 2 (ADB\u2019s \ncontribution to development results), the cause\u2013effect pathways that must occur to reach the \ndesired development outcomes, and issues of attribution versus contribution of ADB operations \nto expected results. Soliciting the views of DMCs and other stakeholders on these and other \npriority issues will be essential.  \n \n5.  The results framework will align with the evolving directions of Strategy 2030 based on \nbackground analytical work undertaken by staff and consultants and feedback from consultations \nwith shareholders, which could include development partners, private sector actors, academia, \nthink tanks, and civil society organizations. ADB will consult non-regional members as part of \nbroader consultations. Key among the emerging directions of Strategy 2030 is the need for ADB \nto broaden its focus to support client countries in meeting their wide-ranging development needs \nin the context of the Sustainable Development Goals; and to promote prosperity, inclusiveness, \nsustainability, and resilience in the region. At the same time, the new strategy will support tailored \ncountry programs that are guided by country needs and by ADB\u2019s comparative advantage and \npotential value addition within its capacity and resources. When ADB adopts Strategy 2030 and \nsubsequently approves the Strategy 2030-aligned results framework, the new framework will \nsupersede the Transitional Results Framework approved in December 2017.4 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: effective monitoring of ADB\u2019s corporate \nperformance  under  Strategy  2030  carried  out.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nmeasurement priorities of external stakeholders integrated into Strategy 2030-aligned results \nframework.5 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Consultation materials for the new results framework prepared. Building \non the successful experience of the transitional ADB results framework, the TA will prepare \nmaterials as inputs for the consultations. The results framework should be simple; easy to monitor; \nand  able  to  measure  important  outcomes  in  organizational  performance,  priority  areas  of \noperation, and contribution to development results. The TA will seek and document stakeholder \nviews on measurement priorities in key areas, including inclusive economic growth; climate \nchange and disaster resilience; green, sustainable, resilient and inclusive infrastructure solutions; \nknowledge work; gender equality mainstreaming; and ADB\u2019s internal efficiency and effectiveness. \nIt will also carry out an assessment of the links between levels 1 and 2 of the results framework, \ncause\u2013effect pathways that must occur to reach desired development outcomes, and issues of \nattribution versus contribution of ADB operations to expected results. Materials on these areas \nwill help inform discussions during consultations and serve as inputs to a draft results framework. \n \n8.  Output 2: Stakeholder views documented. The TA will conduct structured consultations \nwith a variety of ADB\u2019s external stakeholders to discuss the measurement priorities for the \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2017.

Corporate targets \nthat expired in 2016 under the 2013\u20132016 corporate results framework were revised or retained in the transitional \nframework. \n5  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \ncorporate results framework. It will hold external consultations with stakeholders from DMCs, \nparticularly DMC government officials, and with other regional and non-regional members, as \nappropriate. These consultations will be conducted in locations across Asia and the Pacific that \nfacilitate  maximum  participation,  determined  in  close  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s  regional \ndepartments, including the resident missions.  \n \n9.  To  ensure  clarity  on  the  overall  priorities  and  directions  of  ADB\u2019s  new  strategy, \nconsultations with external stakeholders on the new results framework will be carried out after the \nconsultations on Strategy 2030 have been completed and following discussions with the Board of \nGovernors at ADB\u2019s Annual General Meeting in May, 2018. This sequencing is consistent with \nADB\u2019s approach to the development of the results framework under Strategy 2020. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA. SPD will administer and implement the TA from March 2018 \nto December 2019. Other departments and the sector and thematic groups will support the \nimplementation of the TA through peer review and analytical inputs, as needed.  \n \n12.  SPD will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; and convene, organize, and finance \nexternal  consultations  under  the  TA,  including  supporting,  as  necessary,  the  travel  and \naccommodation of DMC officials and other stakeholders participating in the consultations. DMC \ngovernments and the ADB resident missions and offices will nominate external participants to the \nconsultations. SPD will organize consultations with ADB Management and staff. \n \n13.
